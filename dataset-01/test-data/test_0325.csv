5,Challenging workout,"I loved the actual workout, it was challenging and made me sweat. I felt it the next day. the only thing I did not like was the chanting or shall I say counting by the workout participants. It got on my nerves. But I did think the workout was good"
4,Great for Dawson's Creek fans,Mr. Andrews book about Dawson's Creek is a good read. It is funny and a great collectors book. I really enjoyed reading about the show from another fans prosepective. The only complaint I have is that he has a few errors about events on the show. Not very many but enough to keep him from getting a full five stars from me.
3,VING RHAMES stays to Act in WHOLE film !,"01Jan. '12ZOMBIE APOCALYPSE ..Do not just go Willy-Nilly against the Zombie Throng !!!Starring: Ving Rhames & Taryn Manning.This film really works fast to a goal of impending death and destruction for humans.Yes,Other films have traveled this territory,But not with the tenseness and white knuckling suspense.There is a band of humans who use all kind of weaponry to wipe out the zombies who have no plans to stop chewing on everything.So, Noticed that SYFY Channel is listed as co-producers,Explains how VING RHAMES stayed for the whole shoot and not just for close-ups and Peaced-Out and let doubles and long shots do the work ( You listening STEVEN SEAGAL).Taryn Manning ( from Hawaii-Five-O and Sons Of Anarchy) kind of plays the JUDITH DEA part from NOTLD,"" You Know What Mean "" ?Lots of well done special effects and stunts."
1,Dont waste your money,"I love almost anything with zombies so I rented this movie on demand. This movie was absolutely a terrible B movie with no budget and no point to the story. They just walk around the entire time beating up zombies. How about a car dopes? The writer of this movie should be ashamed of himself. Spend your money on ""the walking dead"" seasons, now that is a well thought out plot."
3,Best movie Asylum ever made.,"I hate Asylum, I think they are down there with Troma as the worst in the business. The thing that always gets me is that low budget doesn't have to mean a bad movie, if they only spent more time and effort on what they did, they could actually make a movie worth watching. When the credits rolled and I saw Asylum I nearly turned it off, but I didn't and I'm glad I didn't. This was actually worth watching and surprisingly decent. I'm not raving on it saying it's the greatest or giving it 5 stars like some. But for what it is, it's comparable to Zombie Diaries 1-2 and the German zombie movie Rammbock: Berlin Undead. Guestar57 (the PR man for Asylum) has my blessing to hype this movie, congrats to Asylum squeezing out their first non-turd of a movie. I liked it!"
4,Jesus... what an album!,This one is 2 concerts of joy from Revenge from August 3 and January 31 1991. Good quality and certainly an add-on to One True Passion V. 2.0 from last year. New Order fans; buy it!
5,Nice addition for the camera,These pens work great for cleaning camera lens' and they fit into most cases so you can take it with you. would purchase again
5,Works great!,"I use this to clean my lenses all the time! You can't believe the dust, dirt, and grime that sticks to your lens. Once, I accidently focused on the dirt so the picture showed all the dirt... it was amazing! If you want better pictures, you need to start with a cleaner lens.The brush is great, and the smudge remover really does work. I don't understand how it works, because if you touch the smudge remover to your skin, it leaves a black residue. I have no troubel with black smudges on my lens after using it. I don't know how, but it works!Must have for all!"
5,Waterbeds in Trinidad!,"I purchased Waterbeds in Trinidad! CD to replace my old Lp. I like the music on this CD because it shows yet another side to the very versatile Association. Many people associate the group with top 40-type love ballads, but they are so much more. Some of my favorites from this collection are the very-much ahead of it's time ""Kicking The Gong Around"", Carole King's ""Snow Queen"", ""Rainbow's Bent"" and ""Little Road And A Stone To Roll"". If you're a fan of Jules Alexander's songwriting, this is the CD to get. The only downside to this CD was that I purchased the Japanese import, and I really miss the informative liner notes."
1,A poor company to do business with,I received the wrong item and the company ignored most of my communications and never did make anything right. I will not do business with them again. So I'm just out the money.
2,Nothing You Don't Already Know,Save your money - more than likely you probably already know everything contained in this book if you have curly hair! There was one piece of unusual information that doesn't work for me and that is not to use shampoo on your hair but to wash it with conditioner. YUK!
4,"Terrific ""shampoo"" tips","I ordered this book because my granddaughter has naturally curly hair. She has tried many products and been unhappy with most of them. This book is great. I have loaned it to friends and to some who do not have curly hair.The suggestions in the book work for almost everyone.....less expensive than some of the major products you see advertised so heavily. I would recommend it to many, even if you only read portions of it pertaining more to each person's individual problem."
4,Not sure...,"I've always noted that my waves/curls looked better if I airdry rather that blowdry, regardless of the products I use. I tried to go without shampooing, but my hair and scalp felt very oily. I got online and purchased Lorraine Massey's products from her salon, which included ""Low Poo"" hair cleaner. It works if a large amt is used but my hair looks no different. I also purchased her lavender mist, which smells strange, and her gel which makes my hair feel terrible; stiff and sticky no matter how little I use. And it's all expensive. I wish some of the reviewers who have their own successful routine would email me with the products they use. [...]Thanks."
4,"Hair Care Book, Not Styling Book","Very informative!! I would give it 5 stars if there were better pictures and more hairstyle options for the different types of curly girls out there. Plus they seem very outdated. But for each type of curly hair type you have, it will be listed and there is chapter on care tips and what ingredients to look for to not damage your hair.. there are also natural recipes for your hair which i think is cool. Overall if you're hair challenged like me and have wavy or curly hair... this is a good book... not a styling book but hair care book.. how to love and enjoy wch curly hihair type you have and reach its maximum potential. Think book doesnt give an overwhelming load of information. It's just enough. GOOD LUCK WITH YOUR CHOICE!"
5,So glad to find this book!,"After lots of years of straightening products and processes and lots of big rollers, and blowing dry, I have come to live with and love my 65-year-old naturally curly hair -- hurray! This is the first book I have ever discovered that glorifies the pluses of having curls -- and gives reasonable recommendations and suggestions for hair care especially for those of us whom nature blessed this way. I discovered this book while trying a ""new"" hairstylist at a salon new to me. What a delight to find someone who actually knows how to work with curly hair and bring out its best! I skimmed thru the book while I was there and discussed some of its contents with her --yay! I am a most happy lady!"
4,Worth The Money.,"It may be typical pop/rock, but they're good at it. The vocals are mediocre, but the melodies are enjoyable, and the lyrics are simple. Check it out!"
5,Muddy Water Blues,"There is no mistaking the genious of Paul Rogers. Maybe the best rock n roll voice of all times. I have been a fan all the way back to the Free Band. Then Bad Compamy. He has continued with a solo career to be envied by anyone. If you like the blues, Muddy Waters, you better buy this. You wont regret it."
3,RC Car - fun to build but not very robust,"Just after my grandson and I began building this car (Elenco Funology Radio Controlled Car Kit (non-soldering)), we realized that the final product wasn't going to be very durable. The instructions were clear and we had a fun building it but, as far as I am concerned, the product itself is inferior. The problem is with the materials of construction. The heads on some of the screws weren't large enough so the pulled throuogh the holes. As we screwed parts together, the plastic was very easily stripped. The tracking adjustment would not stay put so we had to glue it into a fixed position making it impossible to make future adjustments. When we finally got it together, the steering servo didn't work when it was right side up but did work when it was upside down. All in all, it's a good idea but better materials should be used."
2,"Good idea, bad quality",It went together but not without frustration. I found the materials to be of cheap quality and would not recommend to a friend.
2,Poor Quality,"Kids must have patience to put this together, as it can take up to 1-2 hours. The plastic molded parts do not fit well together causing the car to not drive straight, even after adjustment. During assembly, when testing the electronics, it smoked and was discovered to be defective. Customer Service was great in helping troubleshoot and sent out a replacement circuit board. Unfortunately the new board had a problem with the variable resistor. I ended up salvaging electronics from an old remote control car and swapped the boards. It worked okay after that. Good learning experience, but bad quality."
1,Never worked,"I got this to build with my son. It comes with a notice in the box to contact the manufacturer if you are missing parts or if they don't work. Must happen often?Of course once assembled the car did not work. I called the number and they said that the main board was probably bad, so they would send me a new one. 2 weeks later it arrived, and guess what, it was defective too. So I am giving up on this toy and sending it back to Amazon.Cheap parts that don't always work, not worth $30.Not worth buying, spend a little extra on a real RC car you can put together because this one probably won't work."
5,elenco radio controlled car kit,"My grandson was very excited to receive this kit as a gift. He put it together pretty much by himself, and had a blast."
1,TECH SUPPORT WHAT A JOKE,Save your money... The only thing good about Bill Collector in a box is........Still trying to figure it out...It's been two days and I'm still waiting on Tech Support to give me a call. Should have used collectors max
4,Solid as a fantasy dwarf,"The author provides a lot of flavor for anyone wanting to play a dwarf in a D&Dv3 campaign. Like the other Quintessential books, it is geared at giving the player more choices. Prestige classes are oriented around the player instead of a fairly two dimensional villian. DMs shouldn't worry. This is not unbalanced. If anything it is a little conservative.Fun factoids: the author notes that he used to work in the office of a gold mine -- he also ran a few all-dwarf D&D campaigns."
4,Good stuff.,"After using this, it's difficult to go back to use WASD. Moving your character around with one thumb beats using 3 fingers. The software does have a learning curve and it does takes getting used to moving with your thumb. Another sucky thing is that you have to load the profile every time you power up your computer. The buttons is a bit sticky, but not too bad. The build quality of this is not quite as good as the n52, but I like the joystiq better than the directional pad. It's also a great device to use with your laptop, if you don't want to wear out the keys on the lappy."
2,Disappointed,"This would more appropriately be named ""Total Shoulder Transformation"" because it works your shoulders nearly the entire time. I have shoulder problems, so this was not good! I can handle some push-ups and overhead presses, but not an entire shoulder work out. Much of my body felt totally unworked by the end. And there is not much in the way of cardio, so I didn't burn many calories (according to my heart rate monitor.) I'm glad this was inexpensive b/c I don't think I'll be doing it many more times. I do love some of Bob's other DVDs; hopefully this one is an anomaly."
5,the hardest workout ever,"I have been doing Jillian's workouts for a few months and thought I'd switch it up. I loved her Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism and No More Trouble Zones. I also have some of her other multi-level videos and can do her level 3's pretty easily and with few modifications.This is my first Bob DVD and it whooped my butt. I finished but had to take several breaks and could not keep up with his pace. That being said, I know that once I build a bit more stamina, it will be an effective workout. It is challenging and intense. I also like how, compared to Jillian's assistants, Bob's are doing this all the way through and are struggling and sweating up a storm."
5,This DVD is INSANE!,"I am a die-hard Jillian Michaels fan and own half a dozen of her DVDs and think they are all great workouts. I wanted to switch it up, so I bought a couple of Bob DVDs. This one is awesome and a total butt-kicker. I am an avid marathoner and exerciser and this DVD kicked my butt!Jillian's DVDs tend to be more focused on a higher heart rate, where as this was focused more on strength with a moderately high heart rate. If you are looking for killer cardio, this is not your DVD. If you are looking for your legs and arms to feel like they are doing to fall off, THIS IS YOUR DVD.I highly recommend this!"
5,A Treasure's Trove,"Kids will be highlighting clues,reading more throughly, and brainstorming ideas where they could be hidden!!! I think it is a wonderful idea and many authors like Micheal Stadther should try this wonderful idea!!! It is a great way to get kids active in reading!!! It's so exciting!!!! The book pulls you in big time!!!"
5,The first token has been found!,"A Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, man is the first treasure hunter to decipher the clues in the book ""A Treasure's Trove: A Fairy Tale About Real Treasure for Parents and Children of All Ages"" to redeem a $25,000 prize.Jake Polterak, 35, found the clue, hidden as a token, on May 22 at the Rickets Glen State Park near Red Rock, Pennsylvania, a 4 1/2-hour drive from his home. The token's prize is an 18-karat gold dragonfly decorated with diamonds and sapphires.Polterak, a computer consultant, had been reading ""A Treasure's Trove"" with his 4-year-old daughter, Allie.""Once I found the token, I couldn't believe how easy it was,"" he said in a statement released Thursday. ""The clues were so accurate!"""
1,ELIGIBILITY-read fine print,"I was very excited to read this book and to use the treasure hunt as a fun and possibly rewarding summer adventure for my two preteen girls. Unfortunately, we live in Maryland. After spending money on this book and a companion book, I read the rules which informed me that residents of MD ND VT and CT are not allowed to participate.Apparently, gaming laws in our states do not allow treasure hunts. Would have been nice to know before purchase."
1,do not quench the Holy Spirit...,"To see a balanced review of this book, go to http://www.vineyard.org/html/pp5.html"
1,Defective right out of the box.,I received the gelato maker in the mail and was eady to try it out. Got all the ingredients together and in the bowl and loaded it into the machine. I turned on the machine as per the directions and it beeped and flashed at my just like it is supposed to do when it has been on too long and the machine is freezing up. I was not very happy with this predicament at all!
2,heebee jeebees,"this movie is not special and its not the worst film I have sver seen. the movie has the typical kids in distress. weird chick in high school want to have a reunion at a run down farm(probably that is all the movie makers could afford). holding a reunion at a barn?--you know your in trouble. your basic stupid behavior from stupid kids makes for good slicing and dicing. I have no trouble with movies like this, but this movie did not move very fast. blood and gore were more than enough with a homage to FARGO in a dream. cast very non-discript and I hope they got paid well. one nice special effect with CGI probably burst the budget(it was nice few seconds). while I can't recommend this movie, I am just going to tell you--YOU COULD DO ALOT WORSE!!. bigger budget and better pacing would have helped and I hope they learn from this, so maybe their next movie will be worth me making popcorn for."
2,Misleading Title.....,"If this movie gives you the Heebie Jeebies, then you have not seen a truly scary horror movie. This movie is not scary and cheaply made. To make this review quick: A young girl dreams that her mother dies and then she does and then she begins dreaming that her friends die and in order to prevent this from happening, she gets them all to meet at a place where she thinks they will be safe. End of story. Another disappointing film."
5,Excellent,This is her best work. It is thoughtful reading. I find myself often returning to passages to savor the meaning.
4,Short But Good,"The Professor is one of four novels by Charlotte Bronte. As with her novel Villette, it takes place in Belgium, but here the protagonist is male.It is based on Bronte's own experiences in Belgium. It is a short novel about half as big as Jane Eyre, and it does not have the emotional highs and lows of her most popular book.This is a light read that centers on an English teacher who has moved to Belgium, and his relationship with the managers of a girls school. Also, it involves his interest in a female student.It has a good ending and most will enjoy the read. It is not a great work of literature.As a point for any potential reader, it is best to not read any reviews that would give away the plot before reading, and similarly skip the analysis until later."
1,Dreadful Narration,"Collecting audio books is something of a hobby with me. In fact they even outnumber printed books on my bookshelf. As with any audio book, the choice of narrator can ""Make or Break"" the listening experience. Some narrators are particularly well-suited to certain authors. For example, Hardy is best narrated by the likes of Tony Britton and John Rowe, the Brontes by Michael Kitchen, Dickens by Martin Jarvis, etc. Oscar Wilde is best narrated by actors with posh accents like Edward Petherbridge and Simon Callow. On this rendition of ""The Professor"", Frederick Davidson makes Simon Callow sound positively working class! His accent is over-the-top and even sounds like a parody of London Society. I didn't get passed Cassette #2 the narrating was so bad, so I still don't know how the story ends."
3,decent quality.,they seem a little frail for meat or fruit but i bought them to use as an art project so they will suffice what i bought them for.
5,Love this movie!,This movie cracks me up everytime I watch it! It's flat out hilarious! lol I bought it for my dad's birthday and he enjoys the heck out of it! A great comedy
5,"""...and biz - ness - is - goooood!!!""","If there is any movie as funny as this one, I would like to know what it is. This is the funniest movie I know. Damon Wayans is so talented; he is hilarious in this movie. There is not one moment in this movie that is poorly done. It just gets better with repeated viewings. I really didn't Damon Wayans other than by name until I saw this movie.The kids in this movie are terrific. Their acting is great! They are all grown up now. If you want to see a funny movie, you have got to get this one. A previous writer was right on the money when he said that Major Payne's character is like a cross between Gomer Pyle and Lou Gossett, Jr.'s character as a drill sergeant. This movie is full of fantastic instant-classic lines that I won't give away here. See it!!!"
4,Major Funny,"I liked it! I am surprised that no one seems to realize this movie is basically a remake of a Charlton Heston film, The Private War of Major Benson (which you really need to see also). This is an excellent updated version with a happy ending for soldiers as well as the Major! Laugh hard, laugh loud and watch for the cameo by the professional wrestler Bam Bam Bigelow in the ""Billy Jack"" fight sequence."
4,Hilarious and you can share it with the kids!,"If you liked Blazing Saddles, you will love Major Payne. It takes several viewings to catch all the humor making this a perfect buy. The kids love it and the tears will roll. A definite BUY."
3,Hello from FEEDMBEANS,"I think Major Benson Winifred Payne (Damon Wayans) is hilarious. He gets all the attention of shaving the cadets' hair and giving them a hard time. For example, Alex Stone wanted to get rid of Payne in this movie. Payne started calling the green boys, ""Turds."" He also sees a woman named Emily Walburn (Karyn Parsons). She is a counselor of the school. I would give this movie 3 stars and 2 thumbs-up."
2,first half was great,"the first half of this movie was really great, i wont bother to metion all the memorable scenes it has. but the last half was just pure trash, payne who was such a character throughout the first half just plane ran out of material. and the movie also seemed to shift gears from a comedy to some sort of feel-good adolescent drama near the end. truefully i really loved the first half, but that last half was just so bad it totally ruined a movie with so much potential."
3,Funny movie,"Unfortunately a lot of adult language. I'd love for my younger boys to see this movie, but it's a bit too agressive with the wording. Maybe when they're older."
5,It never gets old!!,"There are not very many movies that I will watch more than one time because I consider it a waste of time, for the most part, but for me.....this movie never gets old or any less funny. Even though I know what they are going to say and what is going to happen....Damon Wayans manages to crack me up every time. If you don't find this movie funny.....you don't have much of a sense of humor, in my opinion. It's fun and silly and gives me a break from an all too serious world. :o)"
2,High sap factor,"If you like a highly romanticized, misty movie with pretty pictures, lots of ""breathy"" voices, tons of over-acted sex and virtually no plot, this could be the movie for you. The film, although based on a book with more substance, glossed over the things that may have given it depth and over-played the erotic to the point of humor. Perception of counter-cultural life in the time of World War II France, artistic expression as a component of revolution, or self-awareness through sexuality were covered in a haze of intense meaningful gazes (with the usual suspects),romantic French music and scenes of the Eiffel Tower. If there's a movie cliche to make a romantic scene romantic, you will find it in this movie. Rent it when you've just broken up with your partner, are feeling miserable and need to be reminded of how goofy the whole thing is. Otherwise, watch The Tudors instead.The Tudors - The Complete First Season"
2,Pretty to look at but...,"I was not thrilled with this work. Here's why: The movie jumps about in non-logical fashion that distracts from the flow. It is beautifully filmed with great costumes, colors, imagery but the acting is so bland, almost weak! Christ, I wanted to jump in there and show them how to be passionate! The sex scenes were boring. Maybe i should make films! This is frustrating!!It had it's moments so, 2 stars. Wish someone would make a movie about 'Narcissus and Goldmund' or 'Cloister and the Hearth'. Now That would be Passionate! (unless Amblin or Touchstone did it)."
4,Magicians Hat is excellent instrumental jazz-rock!,"This is one of the best surprises in quite a while for me. I search out classic-era rock instrumental music as part of my routine. This one was ""obscure"" from my perspective, but suggestions from other reviews encouraged me to try it and I'm glad I did.Magicians Hat is very pleasant with its variety of instruments and overall balance. The tempo's are varied enough to keep it interesting and the teasing with the jazz spices on piano and sax were beautiful. I really like a mixture of instruments and this delivers.I recommend this for anyone even thinking about journeying into an unknown territory - it's definately not going to be offensive.2ncre8r"
4,Delightful instrumental prog,"Beautiful, relaxing 70's instrumental prog-rock album from Bo Hansson(R.I.P). Similar to his 'Lord of the Rings' album in some ways, but also with some jazziertouches this time. This is enchanting instrumental music that will take you to another world, perfect background music for reading a good fantasy book!"
1,Not made well,"This Labyrinth, 60 Holes is just not made well. The ball does not come out easy. It seems to be a cheap model of a very old game. It's a shame."
4,Great for travel,"This swing is great. You can fold it for travel, but when you get to where you're going, it's full size again. It is easy to assemble and very stable."
2,not for the timid,"For anyone wondering why the BBC books are decreasing in sales, they need only to look at this book. It is dense, in all senses of the word. It is self-absorbed. It stinks of the same kind of over-use of angst the New Adventures perfected. Does anyone really think that this is the book that will make people want to read more Doctor Who? Like many books by men, it obsesses with the magic of ""the womanly cycle"" get over it! Menstruation-envy is just wrong for Doctor Who not to mention insulting. Still, that being said, when tiny threads of a plot do appear, it is a dandy. It takes the story arc into new directions. The question is, do we really want to go there? When the BBC books first came out they professed to be a breath of fresh air, free of the inbred malaise of the New Adventures. This story kicks off a change in the arc that promises to be as distasteful as any from the New Adventures."
4,Very well written book,"The book is very well written and seems to be complete. The Author has made several assumptions that may limit the usefullness and readablity of the book. He assumes that we are all planning to be commercial photographers with our work being prepared to be published and he seems to think that we have unlimited budgets and can afford scanners, cameras and printers that cost several thousand dollars apiece. One other small complaint is that the author being English has used numerous terms and measurements that are unfamiliar. A good book for advanced photographers"
5,Works as advertised,"Makes grinding my coffee easier, with its large capacity and ability to preset amount. I moved up from a simple blade grinder, and maybe am not that picky about the grind quality, but don't see any faults with this -- particularly for $20!"
2,bottom line,"These are of course very difficult subjects to sleuth out, but.....His analysis of estimated people killed in Congo (5-8 million) is less than rigorous.Likewise, rigorous analysis of what ($) Leopold put into the Congo vs. what he took out is lacking. Was this a successful venture for Leopold financially (on a return-on-investment basis)? Maybe or maybe not, but Hockschild does not prove it by pointing out that Leopold put up a few statues and built a wing on his chateau.......Leo was't exactly poor to begin with."
1,Disappointed,"For such a large subject and the amount of research that supposedly went into this book I was expecting a larger book and more detail. Furthermore, on page 139 there is a song transcribedby a missionary which refers to an animal which has never been found in Africa and is highly unlikely to have even been heard of by the Africans at this time. A small point but it makes me wonder how throughly some of the rest of the facts in the book have been checked out."
4,descovering a new world,"what a common people knew about the colonial africa , in case of not a personal involvement, is related to the fights of liberation , independe or whatever you named, but a desclosure of this kind of criminal behavior if far away from usThe King, no matter how was in knowlege of this affais, never could disguise is fault and responsability, pèrhaps the XX centrury africa and a great part of their situations , took is roots in this behaviors."
4,Very Ineresting and Thought Provoking,"Hochschild book is an intersting and thought provoking history of one of the darker sides of western history. It does a brillant job of bringing the horror of Leopold's Congo to the reader.The only criticism is that the book spends too much time on the European and American protest movements. Hochschild readily concedes that the absence of a personal historical record concerning the genocide is a limitation. So perhaphs, the criticism is unfair.Where the book excells is in painting a portrait of Leopold. He truly deserves to be included in the same catagory as the 20th centuries most evil characters. Leopold was responsible for the murder of over 10 million people and Hochschild book finally gives him the publicity that he deserves."
4,"Gross, and Engrossing.","This is an account of the Congo's history. It covers in quite vivid detail the lives of the players and the played who went into the capture of, the taking of, and the liberation of the Congo. King Leopold 2 of Belgium, several Americans, and a certian explorer whose reputation was well entwined with this privately owned colony. Not for those with weak stomachs. In my opinion this proves that Leopold was perhaps the greatest conartist and despot of his time."
5,Eye opening,Excellently written and gripping book. I loved it from page to page. I highly recommend it for any history or story buff.
5,Finally!!!,"A book that tells the truth about colonialism, and all the greed, racism, exploitation and violence behind it. A very little known mass murder comes to life in this very book. This book holds nothing back as it explains Belgian Congo in full, vivid detail. This period should be called the Paragon of Africans! Europeans thought of the Africans as inferior savages, while in reality the Europeans were mutilating and murdering people by the millions! Well written book and very addicting. A must read for anyone!"
1,Author with an ax to grind,"This book starts out okay, but then lapses into the author lecturing the reader about how horrible Europeans are. If you like Europe bashing, this book is for you. Otherwise steer clear."
5,A must read,"Okay, I'll admit it - I'm not done with the book yet...but I'm already here giving it five stars and ordering it to send to other people. It's that good. The story it relates is one of unimaginable horror, all the more horrible because it has largely disappeared from history. How can we forget so easily? The early dissenters emerge as amazing figures of integrity in an age blighted by greed and racism. The writing is gripping, and flows along with intertwining tales where the research is evident, but never hits you over the head in an academic way."
5,"Deeply Disturbing, but a Must Read","This detailed yet accessible history of the colonization of the Congo is exceptionally well-written. Hochschild tells the story of the colonization of the Belgian Congo by providing a thorough biography of King Leopold II and illuminating his astounding greed at the expense of millions of lives.This book was amazingly engrossing. I enjoy reading history, but I think that even a person who is not customarily drawn to history or even non-fiction would find it to be so well-written that they would thoroughly engage with this book.For those of us trying to better understand modern Africa and the legacy of slavery and colonization, this is an essential read."
4,Slightly different from model shown,"The model shown in the photo was exactly like one I've had for YEARS and absolutely love. The one I received is slightly different and is apparently the newer version. It seems to work well, but the motor has more of a ""toy fan"" sound. Hopefully, it will last as long as the prior model. I have fine hair and it works well for me. Not sure it would work as well for someone with thick hair."
4,ANP Review,Using this as a supplement in conjunction with other books to get a different perspective. Would not recommend as a stand alone.
3,Dissapointed,"I just bought a pack of Golden Monkey tea from this company, Adagioteas. But got dissapointed with its quality as compared with the same tea from Teavana. Indeed, I initially felt that Golden Monkey tea from Teavana is likely one of the most expensive and that is why I tried something else. For sure, the old saying ""good cannot be cheap"" indeed works. Will go back to Teavana for the future purchase..."
5,trance for life!!,"If you are a trance fan, this is a must get cd. Tunnel trance force is one of the best european trance collection ever. Dj Dean knows how to trance!!"
3,For Ken deLanguillette,"This is a re-issue of Lang's first CD issued on an independent label. So, it is true that this is a high school kid playing the blues, because that's exactly what it is. Judge this CD in its original context - an unknown blues talent cuts his first CD on an indie label that gets noticed by the big labels. This is not where Jonny is at today."
1,A difficult read,"The credibility of the author (or lack thereof) aside, this book may make some interesting points about the connection between Buddhism and the martial arts. However, those points are lost on me because I could not manage to finish this book; The organization and layout were confusing and the argument was incoherent. Add to this 92 pages of often irrelevant and digressing endnotes, and the process of reading became a chore I was unwilling to perform. I'm quite disapointed because this is a topic that I find very interesting and was looking forward to reading something of substance on. Save your dollar."
1,All repeats,"I love Yanni's music but, I want NEW music. These are the same songs I have on my other 10 CDs. Just because they re-ordered the tracks doesn't make it new (I can do that on my computer)."
1,BURN IT!,"I found this CD to be a disgrace to mankind! I've never even heard it before but just by looking at Yanni on the cover, I can tell that it is totally bizarre and unheard of. I mean listen to Rage Against the Machine for crying out loud. Not this long haired freakazoid. Geez."
4,Good for two to four year old kids,"I got this for my one year old grandson, but my friend's two and three year old kids play with it much more. It is a little too heavy for the one year old to push and turn, but he loves crawling in it and sitting in it. It seems quite durable."
5,Definitley a must!,"My son got this wagon for his first birthday and absolutely loves it!! I am so pleased with this toy. It is very durable and my son loves to push it all around the house. When he is not pushing it, he is usually sitting in it. This is defintiely a toy he will get alot of use out of. I highly recommend it!!"
1,What did they hire you for?,"First of all I would like to give all the people who worked for Rotary Rocket a hats off for the work they did accomplish.To keep this short and simple I think that the author Liz Wiel needs to pay more attention to detail. Another reveiw says she is an ""amazing observer"", I dont think she really observed the things she was hired to observe. Her book was nothing but flaws from begining to end. I would highly recommend NOT waisting money on this book, if you must read this I would suggest waiting till its available in thrift stores or libraries.It seems to me the book is more about the area and the companies employees, not the company and its venture. Maybe next time Liz can pay more attention to the matter at hand. By the way I am not quite sure what kind of mind altering drugs the author was on but the area (Mojave, CA) in which this book takes place in is not at all as it is described."
4,Great--less one,"Shaun the sheep is a huge hit in my house, even with my 22 month old! This is just as good as the other DVD releases, less one episode that scared my 5 year old! The episodes are so clever and require children to sustain attention the length of each episode. Our least favorite was ""Bitzer from the Black Lagoon"". This was a little creepy at the end, thus scaring my son. All in all, Shaun the Sheep is never a bad choice!"
1,Useless,"I am a recently laid-off software developer, and I bought this book thinking that it was going to give me specific information to help me with my search for a technical job. Instead what I got was a short pamphlet with useless generalities not geared to technical jobs at all. The web page for this also says that it can help you keep your current job, but there was no information at all about how to keep a job. I immediately returned this book."
4,A concise argument for non-materialistic living,"What is good about this book?1) It is very short. The time investment required is minimal relative to the practical impact of the material contained.2) It is very precisely argued. Facts are presented intuitively and concisely with footnotes.3) It is colorfully written. This is no small feat for a book that relies on quantitative evidence. I could barely put the book down until I finished reading it.4) It is short, precise, and colorful enough to provide ample grist for discussion among a group of critical thinkers.This book continues to have a positive and practical influence on my life. It has helped me to form my own opinion of the degree of materialism inherent in various choices presented to me on a daily basis, so that I could better evaluate these choices and make confident decisions about the prioritization of my time."
2,Rained out people,"I had seen this when it was released and thought I'd get it to see it again (not available on Netflix - now I know why). With this cast, you'd think it would have to be good, but it was boring and dated in a bad way."
2,Disappointed,"I wanted an introduction to Little's work, read the wonderful reviews here, and bought the book.If I were still a teenager and cutting my teeth on horror, I might have said it was kind of cool but I was raised on King, Rice, Matheson, Clive, and later, Poppy Z.I couldn't finish this story. I just didn't care.I have another book by Little and I will give it a go to see if he can change my mind, but if you're looking to be swept up, away, and into another world that is more exciting than your own ... keep looking."
5,Myth in contemporary society - Euripides to Bentley Little,"Bentley Little has outdone himself with this one. In another review I made on Amazon, I said ""The Store"" is my favorite BL book.This one might have made me change my mind. Yes, it is brutally graphic - especially in the second part, but if you check his source material; Euripides ""The Bacchae"", written in about 450 BC, he is staying true to the form of the original myth, transplanted from ancient Greece into modern-day Napa Valley.BL has done his research, mapped out his story, and unlike some of his other novels, this one has a truly satisfying ending.The story stays with you long after you finish it - the scope of the horror, the visceral violence and the true sense of Dionysian chaos - the Bacchanalia mixed with violence.You'll definitely think about it as you open your next bottle of wine"
3,Good collection but much smaller than I thought,"As I said, by looking at the weight I was hoping it to be slightly bigger than this. .."
2,Poorly made DVD,"I bought the DVD for my collection after watching the film on TCM. The musical perfomances are terrific. Upon receiving the DVD, I was very disappointed in the quality of the DVD production. The DVD states Digital sound, but the sound quality is very poor and not at all as enjoyable as the broadcast on TCM."
5,Bargain,"I bought this fram fuel filter for a bargain and it was the only place I could find this model that I need for my Toyota Camry 2001.It was shipped fast,boxed properly, and it didn't have a single defect. I will now shop at amazon for more of my auto parts needs"
4,Da Wok!,"This is our second non-stick wok and I use it for everything. I make stir fry, soups, scrambled eggs... just about anything that needs cooking on the stove-top. I use and All-Clad 12"" cover for the lid, since it really needs a lid to work perfectly. In fact, that's the only reason I gave it only four stars (no lid). I cook a lot and this my ""go-to"" pan!! Get one."
4,Great Measuring,"I like this tape measure. It is big, so it is easy for my 3 year old to play with and measure things around the house. She got it last year for Christmas and is still playing with it a year later."
4,Gridiron Gang,"""Gridiron Gang"" is the true story of Sean Porter (The Rock), a detention camp officer who tries to make something out of the kids in the camp at which he works. He attempts to instill discipline, honor, teamwork, and pride through football. He feels that this will help to keep them from going back to their old lifestyle once released. He wants to help them break the cycle of violence. Initially met with some resistance, he manages to schedule a season and help the kids make something of themselves.While being a typical ""feel good"" sports movie, ""Gridiron Gang"" feels less clichéd than the majority of these kinds of films. The acting is good all around, and The Rock is well suited for the role of Porter. It is truly remarkable what the real Sean Porter accomplished. I liked this film more than I anticipated, and recommend it."
2,"Under Armour. Under Armor, Under armormoajfds","I couldn't even watch this crappy movie because I saw a BIG BLACK UNDER ARMOR logo the ENTIRE MOVIE on every piece of clothing, IN EVERY SHOT.I counted in one scene, 5 under armor logos at close range. Under ARMOR everything!Now I'm ruined for life because I spent my life savings on under armor products. Product placement sucks."
4,About True Teamwork,"This is a surprisingly good movie. It's a true story about a youth detention counselor (starring Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) who needs to come up with a strategy to straighten out some unruly male juvenile delinquents so that they do not return to a life of crime on ""the mean streets"" of their respective neighborhoods. The counselor decides that the youths could build character and learn some very valuable life-lessons through the teamwork of organized football. It's not an immediate transformation but they eventually come around to trusting each other and become a real team."
4,gridiron gang,"this movie was a pleasant surprise . i know it's based on a true story , but the movie was much better than i thought it would be . good performances all around . the only thing that i felt would've made this dvd even better, would've been the inclusion of the original documentary !"
2,Soooo predictable...,"This film is just like every other sports movie,except with a twist of gang violence.I was extremely dissapointed!It was the worst film i have ever seen with The Rock,and 'The Scorpion King' was a pretty horrible movie.The acting was over done, and the whole plot line wasjust to played out. I know it was based on atrue story and all, but with all of the kids lockedup that joined the little prison team, one of themhad to have had a better story to tell."
3,An okay movie...,"Could have been more motivating though. Youth have a hard time and this movie definitely shows the motives, struggles, and hardships they will have to overcome in order to make it in this life."
4,Handy book if you need to identify what your Enfield is.,"This book helped me to identify my gun, and understand a lot more about it. It is a pleasure to read and gives lots of details. The book covers all No 4 models, including the sniper.Tha last part of the book is a reprint of the sniper manual. A good book for a good gun."
3,"Okay beginners book, but lacking in a lot of ways","I bought this book hoping to fill in any gaps that I might have missed with the other Stratton book about the No. 4 and No. 5 Lee-Enfield rifles. It has a bit more historic information on the production aspects of this rifle, and some useful how-to information for maintenance use, but as a manual for marking identification, it's extremely lacking. In fact, it even contradicts the Stratton manual on marking identifications...perhaps that's too strong a word, maybe I mean to say that it over-simplifies the marking identification process....Either way, I was a little disappointed in this very brief book. But for the price, it's okay for a first time buyer...I just think you can do so much better with the other manual (read my review of that)."
2,A Fair Book,"I read this book for a high school class recently and I like the story but at times it was hard to follow. The Iliad takes place the ninth year of the Trojan War. This book is very descriptive there is a lot of fighting, arguing, revenge and blah blah blah. However don't be afraid to read this book. There are other better versions of this book that are much easier to read. I even bought another version and it's much easier to follow. I think the Iliad is a great story but make sure to find the right version for you; otherwise you will be confused about what's happing and bored out of your skull.P.S. Get a book with a glossary in it; it will help tell you who's who and what's what."
5,Keeps Burner Clean,Keeps Burner Clean. Prevents burner from getting dirty from wax spillage. Burner usually brings one and more will be needed eventually.
5,Wonderful story,"Although this book was part of a series, it was excellent. This is the first book by Stephanie Whitson that I've read and I must say that I was very impressed. I found the book at a thrift store and paid $.25 for it. It was well worth the quarter! Soaring Eagle thought he was too old and too poor to ask Carrie (Red Bird) to be his wife. Carrie thought he would marry someone else before he noticed that she had changed into a young woman. I haven't read many novels where an Indian was a Christian and tried hard to obey God's commands. What Carrie went through was horrible. I was so moved by her suffering and then her acceptance of what happened to her that I needed a box of Kleenex tissue to finish this book. It was a great book and I recommend it."
5,What Hostage Was Like.,"i think that hostage was a wonderful book, but i would only reccomend it to people who like adventurous books and who like scary books. the book will teach you that what happened in the book could actually happen to you! but all in all, this book was interesting and it left me breathless in some parts of the book."
3,"Nice pan, wish it lasted longer","The 10 inch nonstick skillet is a frequently used item in my house, so we need something that will last. We usually stick with Calphalon, Analon, Cuisinart, or KitchenAid and generally get 4 years plus out of the good quality pans before the coating loses its nonstick properties, or somehow gets scratched, or the bottom no longer remains flat (necessary on the smoothtop). The KitchenAid was a bargain at around $20 from Amazon, but evidently we got what we paid for as after only two years, food would stick to it. Before that, it was a nice pan, maybe a small cut below the other brands I mentioned, but I will say that although food now sticks to it, the pan looks brand new at least. Hoping for more longevity out of the skillet I got to replace it (an Analon)."
2,Would not recommend,"The toy is unstable and falls over very easily. The plastic base underneath the pink inflated base is way too small to stabilize the toy, and the pink inflated base is under-inflated (and there's no way to re-inflate it), causing the whole thing to fall over very easily. Very disappointed in this product as it looked cute and fun for our cats. I'm giving it 2 stars because our cats like the toys hanging from the wires (even though the toys are generally on the floor)."
1,Very Disappointing,"At first, I didn't mind this book. But as it got into the whole Christian aspect, I really got bored. Although a Catholic, I felt that it was a bible lesson shoved into a poorly written story. Theres nothing wrong with that, although the plot lines could have been better, I did like Paul's descriptions of things. I felt as if the story was just thrown together at the last minute, and didn't enjoy this book. The characters could have used more description, and its quite pointless to have a map unless the characters travel across the whole area. I wouldn't recommend this book, only to those who wish to be bored out of their minds."
5,dragonspell is the best book ever!!!!!!!!!!!,"donita k pauls dragon spell is such a wonderfull book, she covers the smallest detials from hatching eggs to sceanic flights on dragon backs ,one moment you are leaping for joy the next you are scared half to death the book really lets you form a great picture in your mind ,personly i think the best parts are when the dragon eggs hatch its sutch a calming moment when the dragon emerges into kales hand i would defintly recomend this book for ages 9 and up"
3,nice photo,Photo looks great. But when I got the them it didn't look as good on MY foot as I'd hoped.
2,not good for browning,"This pan takes forever to heat up. Everything else about the pan is fine, but if you want to saute something quickly, forget it. I find that feature very frustrating. Even pancakes wouldn't brown well and were doughy in the middle. I gave the pan away and bought a Cuisinart."
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!,"[...]Secondly: This is an old article written by someone who doesn't seem to have any understanding of the physiological consequences of forceful prone restraint ... the article doesn't contain anything of any significant merit ... and the author cites an LA Times NEWSPAPER ARTICLE to support several of the statements she reports. Personally, I wonder why she didn't CHECK the validity of the information that was reported by the newspaper article author, and discover one or more MEDICAL SOURCES to cite in support of her statements.Basically, this is a LESS-THAN-1-STAR paper."
5,just what i needed,"this pump lasted me a few years, and i just had to replace it. i would expect another 4-5 years of flawless service. the pump is well built and is exactly the same as the 4-5 year old one that i am replacing."
2,Pros and cons,"This book is a collection of two titles, The Dreamstone and The Tree of Swords and Jewels.I found The Dreamstone to be a wonderful read. Very concise in its form, the pacing worked well, and the story unfolds over a period of years, which is important to the central focus of the novel being on Eald and its relationship with humans. This first book comes in at under 200 pages, I believe, and really feels right.Now, the second book is where things fall down. Somewhere along the way someone must have suggested that this story needed more words. Because there's a lot more words. And they're not all necessary. Gone is the conciseness of the story, gone is the mystery of Eald, as we focus more on humans and their squabbles over the kingdom. This book loses focus from the first one, and really drags through the final half. It is too long, it is too wordy, it is too complicated... it is just too much, frankly.A shame, really, since The Dreamstone was really a wonderful read in itself."
5,A call for peace,"David Grossman, one of Israel's top writers and a patriot who lost a son in the war in Lebanon, wrote this tough book over 20 years ago. In the book, he interviews Palestinians and Israelis whose voices had never been heard before in such a pure and ideologically-uncensored way. They speak of suffering, hopelessness, hate, hurt, revenge, pride and prejudice. I hope that people from all sides of the political spectrum will read this book in the spirit of putting an end to the conflict and reaching a mutually acceptable peace, rather than as a tool for anecdotal propaganda."
1,"Good Skillet, NO LID!",DO NOT BUY THIS EXPECTING THE LID IN THE DESCRIPTION!I never recieved the lid described in the description section.They had a similar skillet in colors for less.Skillet is a quality weight anodized aluminum.It has what seems to be a high quality nonstick interior.The comfort handle has a good feel and is oven safe to 450 degrees.CONThe cushion handle means you CANNOT use in a broiler.No top browning your omelet in the broiler.
1,Not a favorite,Ive read quite a few books on the Krays and this was not my favorite one. Seems a bit rushed and simplified. I was never sure if what I was reading was the truth.
4,good resource,"I give Civil War lectures; and I am always on the lookout for good reference books. I have all three of Annie Abel's books on Native American involvement in the war. While her writing style is a bit dry, more like reading a thesis than a book, her books are chock full of valuable information. A lot of footnotes that include original letters from the players of the time. A great book for someone looking for information in detail and has a good attention span."
3,A Fairy Tale for fairies.,"Tooth Fairy Belle Moody has fallen on hard times. Her Aunt Lila, a retired fairy, has lost the family money in bad stock market deals. Help comes from a friend of Belle's Uncle, a retired Easter Bunny, who hires Belle to be a pretend Princess. Boone Wentworth is sick and grief stricken. The man believes he is dying. When he uncovers the bogus Princess, he thinks that she is only there to con some money out of him and his mother. So he abducts her...things get complicated by lies, attraction, and the call of the Dark Side. Sleep Tight in an entertaining, though somewhat uneven, fairy tale romance. Some of the real life aspects just don't blend all that well with the Fairy aspects, but the characters are likable and there is plenty of humorous zing at times."
3,Boogeyman meets the Tooth Fairy,"I picked up Sleep Tight, read the first few paragraphs and was hooked. This is a nice little story. It reads quickly and has a satisfactory ending. I'd like to see a sequel and am looking forward to Kissing Frogs which I just ordered.For more paranormal romances, I would recommend Davidson's Undead and Unwed, and Undead and Unemployed."
5,i enjoyed it thought it was sad though,"this program brought back alot of menmories for my hubby ,and me we too grew up in the sixties and seventies would like to see more programs like that instead of these other court shows too many serious on them"
2,Not great...,"While it doesn't dishonestly advertise being a documentary, it offers little. The soundtrack, of course, is great. Keep some Dramamine handy, though...the effects, such as they are, are both dizzying and superfluous.If it is actual footage of Django you seek, as little as there is, all known footage can be found on the ""Swing Guitar"" DVD, a far superior endeavor..."
2,Rent this first,"Once played you will not keep going back.This is a reasonable documentary spoiled by graphic effects. The DVD has no chapters to go to and you can't even jump to a specific time. All you can do is fast forward it, just like a video tape, and this DVD runs for almost two hours! There is no film footage of Django, but you do get a C.D. as a bonus. The DVD to get is ""Django Reinhardt - Swing Guitar [DVD] [2006] "", this is the one with all the known film footage of Django."
5,The best OOB as of 2005,"Not a long review here. I've read more than a dozen OOB books, and this one is the best of all of them. I enjoyed the Monroe books and some others, but if I had to choose one book to recommend to someone (just one!) this is the one I'd recommend."
1,Total wrong information about astral projection.,"Oh, my god. I do not even know where to begin, the author has no idea about astral projection. All these misleading information about this subject, author think astral projection is not possible in reality but in your dream stage, and author think you can total astral project while you are awake in your physical body. The book is a joke, don't buy it, you will be fooled just like me, this book end up in trash can.A TOTAL DISASTER."
5,GREAT CD BUT...,"The CD is great with very relaxing music. Infact the first time I played it I ""think"" I may have got minor vibrations. But after that I have been trying everyday with headphones on my head but no luck in reaching the vibrations and ultimately having OBE.I am all for easy ways to experience OBEs. This idea seemed good. But after a while you feel your ears are sore with the headphones attached.Anyway I still think it's worth buying the CD."
3,Nothing new really,"Enjoyed the book, but if you've followed the series you're not going to learn much here. The majority of the book is devoted to the stories and pictures of the cast members, with the final section giving basic diet and exercise tips. More of a coffee table book than anything else."
5,The real deal,"I'd ordered this DVD after working with a personal trainer for a week. It kicked my butt and when I returned to give my opinion about the DVD to my trainer he responded ""oh yeah, that's the real deal - you'll definately see results"".I've ordered a lot of Kathy Smith workouts and although challenging, they don't even compare to the intensity of these workouts. I've already lost 3 lbs after using this DVD for a week. I'll certainly be ordering the sequel DVDs."
2,Good for starters!,The 6 week custom workout program is the best thing about this DVD. It really makes you feel like you are getting a personal trainer at your finger tips and you have no doubt what you need to do for 6 weeks. Bob Harper is great on the eyes and makes an excellent cheerleader to keep someone motivated. This exericse DVD is not stiff or uptight but very informal and yet challenging. Great to do when you don't have enough time for a gym workout. Highly recommend it for beginner's and intermediate level exercisers.
4,Pretty Good Workout,"First, I have to say the actual exercises are good and should be done about 4-5 times a week for results. Other than that, it's not the best I've seen, but I knew what to expect so I did get quite a lot of use out of this. I've done many workout dvds, and this falls short of some of the other workouts out there. The warm up is choppy with no real flow, and the low intensity aerobics is a hodge podge and not a whole lot of fun.I have recently started doing Kundalini Yoga (Fat Free Yoga with Ana & Ravi along with Soul Sweat with Chantal and Dance the Chakras Yoga workout with Ana & Ravi) I recommend you also add some Kundalini Yoga for its effects on the metabolism and it feels like less hard work as well. I am actually getting faster results in terms of weight loss and fun!As far as this Biggest Loser Workout I recommend you keep your eyes on Gary. Gary works out the best. He's lost so much weight - I think it's because he looks and is more physical than the others."
4,Excellent Workout,This is an excellent workout. I feel completely worked out when i'm done with just the first one which is the low-intensity workout. I cant wait to move on to the others. Its great also because they lost the weight doing these workouts at least thats how i feel about it. Its completely worth the money to me. Bob is funny and the people are great. I definitly recommend this dvd.
3,Not for the WEAK!!!!,"This is not for beginners. But if you are looking for toning, this is the DVD for you. Very motivating-Bob looks directly at you and speaks to you. The cast are very good too. If they can do it, so can I. You will be sore. No music really on the DVD. As you get used to it, use an MP3 as I do. Workouts are quick and I structure it for me."
2,Book should not be used to determine value of pieces!,"This book contains nice photographs. However, the prices of pieces are unrealistic. Some quotes seem extremely low and other extremely high. The author doesn't mention the condition of the piece when quoting prices The greatest factor the effects the price of pottery is the condition of the piece. A price should never be given without a discription of the condition of the piece. The book would be a nice reference for a novice collector. But price information should be ignored."
3,Typhoon Buick Red Timer,"I thought this looked great, old-fashioned, shiney & red. It is all of that but the ring when it's done is so annoying I never use it. Instead of a pleasant ding like a bell it's an obnoxous ring like an old-fashioned alarm clock, very jarring. I would not reccomend this item nor would I purchase it again."
2,Too bad.,"It sounds very promising - a mystery involving a publisher, a bestseller and links to the Second World War, set in London and New England, but... I was disappointed.Unsolicited takes forever to start. I read and I read and I never feel the grip of the book until well into the second half of it. Then I'm annoyed at how the hero Alex Plumtree acts around his secret love, Sarah. He's pathetic. Then I'm annoyed by the slow tempo, again. And then...There's nothing wrong with the story and the topic, it could have been a great book, but I don't like the way it's told now. I did not fall for Plumtree or Kaewert."
4,Good book,I been a fan since I was a kid I always wanted to know what happened behind the scenes of some of those matches.
4,The Legend Speaks True.,"This is the most honest sports biography I've read to date. He gave this reader an insightful, entertaining, and sometimes sad look into both his life and the wrestling business. He is both respectful and critical of the business and some other wrestlers. But, gives logical reasons for being so. Flair is everything his harshest critics have rarely been, successful for over three decades. You can't make a good living in your chosen proffession for that long if the fans were not willing to pay to see you. Flair's talent made him a star, Hogan was a media creation."
3,To Be the Man,"A good, very quick read. I think anyone who is or has ever been a fan of professional wrestling will really enjoy this book. I thought this book was very well written. Alot of behind the scenes stuff that I found quite interesting. Definately a one-sided version but still worthwhile."
3,Is it real?,"Wrestling is so staged, one has to wonder if this book further blurs the lines between reality and fiction. And isn't this guy a little long in the tooth to still be taking falls? He looks like a male version of Donatella Versace these days."
3,Keep book out of baby's reach,"My 16 mo old daughter has loved this book since she was 12 mo., but I have to keep it out of her reach . She loves to lift the flaps but has now been tearing the flaps off when she reads the book on her own. She is only allowed to read it in my lap where I can stop her from ripping the flap off."
4,my 2 year old loves this book,"Our 2 yeard old loves this book. He instinctively knew how to lift up the pages covering the body parts. He loves it. I only wish it included more body parts. It's very short...only a few pages and doesn't really highlight enough of the body. But given the price, you can't complain. Adorable book."
2,Flop,Only a few pages. Kind of a waste of money. Not much point to buying this product as after three seconds you are finished reading it to your child.
5,book,The book is super cute and is in great condition and my niece will love it. It is not your typical book and that is what I like about it.
2,Creepy,I think the illustrations in this book are a little creepy. My baby is not so nuts about it either.
4,"Great ""Peek a boo"" book","My son 12 months at the time loved flipping over the pages to ""Peek a boo"" what's underneath. Only drawback was that the flip up pages we too thin and are easily damaged."
5,Great book for babies and toddlers!,"I bought this book for my first baby girl, back in 2004, and it has been a favorite of each of my children since. Currently, it is my 5 month old son's FAVORITE book. He will see it across the room and crawl for it! He gets very excited and bounces around with anticipation when you hold him and the book. He ADORES this book. HE gets excited to lift the flaps and see what is behind them. It is so wonderful to watch how excited he gets over a book! He likes many other books, but this is the book he gets most excited about!"
5,My Grandaughter loved it,"She just turned one and after reading the book to her one time,all you have to do is ask Where is your Belly Button?She finds hers,mine and anyone elses you ask her about,so cute,"
2,Good Short Story,"I wouldn't call this a book nor sell it as one. It is a well written, interesting short story. I felt a bit cheated, as I thought I was buying a book and settled in for a long read. Much to my surprise, it quickly ended."
3,I love Karen Black,I am a fan of Karen Black. She is not featured in this movies til the end. It's not her best work to me. I love the movie Burnt Offering where she is in every scene.
4,Another sad tragic NASCAR story,Another sad tragic NASCAR story about a driver with great potential who had his life cut short before achieving the long-term success meant for him. A good summary of Tim Richmond's life on and off the track but the book does not go into great detail. Definitely a worthwhile read.
5,Bill Lentz,"Some will see this as an interesting story concerning one man's ride around the perimeter of America. Most will find in these pages, the story of how a man faced some of the most discouraging challenges life presents and worked through them. Dwight Smith writes about his journey in a manner that is as interesting as it is inspirational."
3,3 Stars- for quality- read on,"I was thrilled when I recieved this beautiful hardwood game. We take it to gatherings and everyone (children and adults) we have introduced Michigan Rummy to loves it. However, when we started to play this particular game it was a mess. In the original Michigan Rummy, other cards in other suits are ""money cards"". This game shows only spades and clubs. (Compare this board to the other Michigan Rummy game sold at Amazon. It is the green plastic one and the money cards are correct.) ANYWAY, we adapted by cutting up a deck of cards and placing them as they should be. Thank goodness for Amazon- no one else carries this game."
5,Our Marching Band,March right out and get it! It's a delightful book. This is the second book by the author that my nieces and nephews have enjoyed. The book has made music come alive for them and given them an appreciation for the challenges and joys of making music. The text and illustrations work seamlessly!
2,solar rainbow chimes,"Not so good.It doesn't work sometimes, have to tap it.It makes a clunk sound when mechanism reaches top an falls to bottom.hard to hear chimes."
5,Happiness Abounds!,"This is ""one of those items you want but won't spend the money for."" Send it as a gift to friends, relatives, and yourself! YOU WILL get a thank-you for this gift!"
1,Came broken,"The product came broken. The strings broke, i tried to use a different string in an effort to try to put it together. Even using a different string, the product did not work.I returned the product and got a full refund."
2,What happened to the series?,"This certainly isn't the book I expected after reading Coalescent. Where Coalescent was an interesting exploration of how a new form of human society could form, and had fairly well thought out characters and dialog, Exultant almost completely drops every one of the themes from the first book, and takes a hard right into space opera. Except for one or two incredibly brief nods to the eusocial societies of the first book, Exultant is pretty much wall to wall blazing lasers with stock characters. Some of the concepts are interesting, but it all needed to be sorted out much better."
3,The little album that might.,"Twee little pop experiments abound on this short (33 minute) album by Half-Handed Cloud. Even if they deal with Christian themes, it's dangerous to call this ""Christian Music""... certainly your average Amy Grant fan might be a bit slack-jawed listening to this, while the average indie-rock fan will find it familiar.... it sounds like the fragmentary songsmithery of early Guided by Voices meets the wide-eyed early Of Montreal pastoral pop psychadelia. It's sort of a low-fi, small-sounding music, the singer sounds a bit like a six-inches-tall version of the singer from Elf Power. No disrespect meant. In its own way, this little album RULES."
1,Poor Quality Patches,"I have been using Tens Patches for almost 5 years now, and these are the worst patches I have ever used!!! They do not stick, nor do they seem to transfer the electical pulse properly? Do NOT waste your hard earned money on these!"
4,A Stunning Work of Art,"This knife while stunning to look at, lacks the weight to make it a functional piece of cutlery. This knife is ideal for vegetables, poultry and other light chores."
5,"IT MADE ME LAUGH,AND CRY!IT TOUCHED MY HEART","THE FIRST TIME I READ THIS BOOK, I WAS FIFTEEN YEARS OLD,AND I LOVED EVERY PAGE.IT IS KNOW SIXTEEN YEARS LATER, I JUST READ IT AGAIN.ALL I CAN SAY IS, EVERY WOMEN DESERVES A GAVIN RAMSEY!"
4,Surprised by a romance book.,This book was given to me along with a bunch of others by a relative. I took a break from my Sci fi and adventure novels to read it.I was pleasantly surprised by the strong storyline and lack of romantic prose that I associate with this type of novel.Worth reading if you can find it.
3,IT'S ALRIGHT FOR THE MONEY,"well the radius is not far so you wont be able to goto fast and you have to react directly after it goes off.But most of the time it is a false alarm ( it always goes offwhen i pass walmart or cvs, i guess it is their doors thatgive out the false alarm)well but i guess it is alright for the buck.i mostly use it on the highway, in the city ( even thoughit has the city or highway option) i usually have itturned off cause the signal gets annoying after a while"
3,unsure of potential,I have bought one for my husband then one for me. My husband says his goes off within a longer distance. It seems to me you have to be pretty close to the radar gun or laser for it to go off. I went passed a few local cops and it didn't go off at all. I had a few pass me going in the opposite direction and they were almost directly across from me before going off. My husband claims his works slightly better but weirdly we haven't seen any staties to really test it fully.
3,Whistler XTR-325 Radar/Laser Detector,"I recently purchased the Whistler XTR-325 Radar/Laser Detector and used it on vacation through the states of Missouri, Illinois, Indiana, and Kentucky.The product worked well and I averaged 5 miles per hour faster than on previous trips without a detector. City mode worked great as well as the quiet mode, keeping the false warnings low and noise level down.The only drawback to this product is it's size. I was hoping for a unit that was about half the size. I though digital meant smaller? I hope they downsize the next model."
3,Not bad.,"The graphics, sound effects and music are excellent. The quality of the animation is very good. The variety of courses large and varied. However, they're all very long...The first race course, is the one from the movie. It's easily the best of them all. After completing the tournament, you can race on many different courses on many different planets. You can be Anakin or anyone else.The graphics on some of the courses are a little rough and you get the sense that perhaps a few things were left out in the rush to production.However, it's a fun game to play, but I would recommend checking it out at a local store or renting it first, just to be sure."
2,It'll keep you busy for 3 days.,"As long as you know how to handle an N64 controller, than this game's pretty easy. The multiplayer racing isn't fantastic either, it only holds up to 2 players. Also, if you want to have the full graphics experience, you must have a memory pak."
3,Good Game,"This a great game if you enjoy racing games, however, that's all it is--a race game. It is basically the same as any other racing game."
2,BORING!,"Star Wars Episode I Racer is a severe disappointment. It does not have anything interesting, other than ramming you oppenents. Worse, it damages your pod! There is no sabotage, and there is no blasting your fellow racers. It will not hold your interest for longer than a day (mine lasted 1.5 hours). Star Wars fanatics should buy Rogue Squadron instead. Or, better yet, Perfect Dark."
3,Time will tell,Just got this unit. The baffle hangs loosely on the plug ring. It does not attach securely. This is by design. I don't know if it will work. Time will tell. Maybe it is suppost to be loose on the hanger but it does not seem right to me.
5,2003 Wrangler Sahara,"This is the install kit you want to replace the factory in dash radio. Easy to use, looks great. Mine was a 2003 Jeep Wrangler Sahara Edition. Great fit. Delivery was FAST."
4,Polished Brass Door Guardian,This is an effective add on to increase door access security. It is easy to install and well made. I have installed two of these door guards and am planning to add another to my front door.
3,Good but not great,"I would really recommend Denise's Indoor Walk dvd rather than this one, at least for beginners. This dvd has only one difficulty level, and the routine is fast paced and can be hard to follow for those who are not well-coordinated. This is better for those who are more experienced with working out. I had to set my copy aside for later, after I'm in better shape and have more experience with dvd workouts. Meanwhile I'm using her Indoor Walk dvd every day. Cardio Dance and Sculpt is a good workout, and if I could keep up I'd probably enjoy it, but I'm not there, at least not yet."
3,"Good for strength, not for cardio","The strength portion of the DVD is fantastic because Denise works both the upper and lower body at the same time. I can really feel my muscles toning and strengthening. The cardio portion is disappointing, however. It's very easy and the moves are a bit silly. I use this DVD for strength and then switch to Tamilee's ""Tighter Assets"" for cardio. Denise herself is a little too perky for my taste, and she is terrible at cueing! But I appreciate the fact that she is working out with normal-looking women."
3,A Fun DVD,"Of all the Denise Austin exercise DVD's I have, this is my least favorite. But it's still fun. I will do the cardio section often in addition to her Shrink Your Female Fat Zones DVD. I think this one would be good for someone just starting out."
2,Not bad,"I don't use this DVD. Its kind of corny and I feel like an idiot doing the exercises. I think its the lame music and those background women exercising - they look too happy (hahaha). No but the truth is that although I like Denise Austin's ""Female Fat Zones"" DVD, I don't see this ""Burn FAT Fast"" does much good. The movements are too ridiculous and too confusing if you're not into the aerobics scene of doing the ""grapevine"". Overall, this DVD is probably good for people that are into aerobics classes. If you've got a left foot, then don't get this. Its just not very inspiring."
3,Not good for iPhone 4s,This item doesn't work with the iPhone 4s but it does work with the regular iPods. If ur trying to find something for the iPhone 4s look else where but if it's just for a regular iPod your ok.
1,Didn't work for iPod,This product didn't work for my iPod so I had to return it. Sadly disappointed that I wasted my time purchasing it.
1,The itrip damaged my iPod Touch,"Dear Sr.I bought the itrip the last december for my iPod Touch 2g, but when i connected the itrip to my ipod, the ipod inmediately stop working so it didn't turn on anymore."
2,ok. it does what it says it will do,"hey, it transmits to the FM station that you set it to transmit on BUTTTTT... I live in houston and you need two clear stations for this thing to transmit clearly and there aren't any! THUS ... STATIC ...It's a waste of time if you live anywhere where that are lots of FM stations. HMM.. that'll be all of AMERICA and the world!!!"
3,A must buy for the Sansa MP3 but sound quality is not great...,"A must buy for any sansa mp3 product but really the charger is the best part of this product...the fm transmitter is adequate but the sound quality is just ok...a fair amount of static especially in big cities...i use the direct output line from the sansa to the auxillary input anyway, so i don't use the fm transmitter...but the charger is nice and sound quality with the sansa mp3 is improved when the charger is hooked up,..."
3,"Good idea, but noisy","This is a neat product, and easy to use. Too bad the quality of the FM transmission isn't that good. I picked a quiet FM frequency, but once the iTrip is turned on--even when the Sansa is paused--there's a whole new level of noise above that of my chosen frequency. When loud music is playing, you really don't notice it, but in quieter passages it's annoying. Also the volume level is quite a bit lower than real radio stations. So when I switch the to iTrip, I have to crank up the volume; and when I switch the other way, I'm apt to be blasted! One other quirk is the iTrip manages to transmit these odd little clicks and buzzes associated with the Sansa switching to the next song in a random shuffle--sounds I do not hear when listening directly on earphones."
4,OK for its purpose,"THE GOOD: Easy to operate, don't get much static even in LA where there are lots of radio signals to compete with, recharges your player during use. THE BAD: Weird auto shut-off if you don't use it for one minute, I get static and distortion on the stereo setting and have to use it on the mono setting, can't control volume on the unit when it's plugged in (have to use car volume control). OVERALL: If you're looking for a basic FM transmitter and don't set your expectations too high, this is fine."
2,Very disappointing,"Having both their previous albums, I was really waiting for this one. However, I am extremely disappointed with it. Gone are the smoother, anthemic chants and brasswork which has been such a driving force in their music in the past... now I hear scratchy vocals that make me want to hurt things. I found this CD very bland, not easy to listen to by any means even if you previously enjoyed the music of River City Rebels, and quite frankly there are no standout tracks. The horns are virtually non-existent, even more so than the last album, and the melody seems to have all but disappeared. I wouldn't recommend anyone buy this CD, it's very stale and uninspired to say the least."
2,Why such good reviews?,This is probably the worst book I have ever attempted to read. I can not for the life of me figure out how or why it got such good reviews. The character development is non existent and the athor's continual use of archaic words is distracting and adds nothing to the story. Maybe I`m missing something here but since when did owning a thesaurus make one a great writer? Here`s hoping my review will save someone else from shelling out hard earned money on pretentious drivel.
3,"Good book, little point","I have read the majority of McCarthy's books and he is by far my favorite author. I enjoyed this one the least. I did like Suttree as a character, but the book has too many pointless, rambling sections that seem put together by an author on a bad acid trip. I didn't count, but the four letter ""c"" word must have been used 30 times or more, adding very little to the work. There are incredible sections of this book that make you love McCarthy, but then he sabotages it with endless, painful, pointless chapters. If you want read better works by this author, try the boarder trilogy, the road, or no country. Save this one for when you are running out of his books to read."
3,Bepuffed,"Befouled melon; befouling sewage. Be wild, be lost. . .bewildering. Mr. McCarthy has taken a drunk-[...] fisherman (with a thesaurus stapled to his soul) and let him wander--eternally, it seems-- with the stupid white, the broken black, and the aging whore through a dying slum.There is, though, at places poetry here.Hemingway was once criticized by Faulkner for never sending readers to a dictionary. ""Poor William,"" Hemingway replied. ""Does he really think big emotions come from big words?""Bespoke, Mr. McCarthy? Is that ye?"
2,Glee Boo,It really wasn't very good. It was short an jumped around too much. I want to watch a concert straight through not jump back an forth. Wasn't worth the money spent. Dislike.
1,Poor sound quality,"I have bought many blu-ray discs because of the amazing sound quality they offer, such as the Adele concert in Albert Hall. But unfortunately the Glee Concert blu-ray is very disappointing. Out family enjoys Glee very much and love the show, but the blu ray disc quality does not do justice to the show. I wouldn't waste money on this release.The case says contact www.foxconnect.com if you have questions, but the website says they only support the US. so we in Canada are left unsupported."
2,Disappointing,"Honestly, I thought it was horrible! we don't want to see how glee changed someones life, we want to see them preform!"
2,crap,received this as a wedding present in nov 07. have only used it for slightly over 7 months and the non-stick coating is already damaged. i have always washed this by hand and use a bamboo fryer so as not to damage the coating. am pretty surprised by the quality of this kitchen aid pan. it is also very heavy. i would not recommend buying this to anyone. am going to try getting a warranty claim on the pan.
2,Not userful,Very disappointed when this book arrived. This is geared for older children and should state that. Certainly not aimed for 3 to 4 years old.:(
2,dissapointing,"I really hate to give a bad review because all other Kitchen Aid products that I have purchased have been great. Unfortunately this non stick pan did not measure up. The first time I fried an egg, which is one of the main things I use non stick pans for, it stuck. I use cast iron for most things, except eggs. This pan was not nearly as good as my old Circulon, which has worn out after 3 years. All non stick pans wear out, but this one certainly did not live up to expectation."
5,Jingle All The Way Review,"This is one of the funniest, best Christmas movies I have ever seen. The story is so complex and funny at the same time. There are plenty of things for everyone in this movie, drama, comedy, etc. This movie is sure to become a favorite Christmas classic, and should be kept in your favorite Christmas movie collection."
3,It was OK.,"I agree with Zachel, if you saw the movie, try to remember it, in this very moment, it didn't have a great plot (not like Miracle on 34th Street) but I think it should have more touching actors, Jake Lloyd (stared as Anikin Skywalker in Star Wars episode 1) was not that touching with his character as Arnold's son, if there's gonna be a sequel, put Richard Attemborough or James Earl Jones."
5,love this movie,I always enjoyed this movie as a kid and it hags always been a favorite holiday movie. Kudos to the seller for shipping it so fast.
5,"Great, fun film!",Our VHS of Jingle All The Way was eaten by our VHS player. Our whole family enjoys the film and never tire of seeing it. Sinbad is hilarious and Phil Hartman is perfect in his role. Nice to own it on DVD!
4,hilarious,got to get the action figure fight the crazy post man steal contest and eventually learn that time is the best gift
1,Poorly used copy,I bought this used and the seller wrote it was in good condition. It came looking very worn and in broken packaging so the disc couldn't even click into it. There wasn't even a return slip so that I could return it if I wanted. I was very disappointed with the condition of this.
1,Yuck.,"A family member loved this movie, and would watch it on a regular basis. It got more unbearable every time. Horrible, horrible, horrible. Don't wait those precious moments of your life watching this."
3,Who knew!,I liked this movie years ago and remembered it the last time I saw it on here and ordered it for my younger son and we loved watching it together.
2,when there is a doctor,This book is great for when little Jimmy scrapes his knee. This book is great when you have a medical professional 5 minutes away. If you are looking for survival/emergency guide this is not it.
5,Ecushe,"The Handbook makes our tradition accessible. A highlight of this work is the wonderful job Baba does in paralleling Ifa with other spiritual practices and beliefs. This facilitates the reader's understanding of Ifa and traditional African spirituality as sacred. Baba's work helps dispel the negative ""hoodoo,"" manipulation cloak which often surrounds African religion. This book makes it easy to return to our tradition and receive the full benefit of our sacred and powerful spiritual science. We give thanks to the divine forces guiding Baba's work!"
4,Hamburger Bun Rings!,"I purchased these muffin rings primarily to make gluten free hamburger buns. They work perfectly for that purpose; the rings make buns the ideal size. I just set them on a baking sheet, add the dough, smooth the tops and bake. They released perfectly with a spritz of cooking spray. I recently baked buns with these rings in a Coleman camp oven, and they turned out marvelously. There is no problem with rusting, but I do have to be careful not to let them get bent in the camp box. I am ordering a second set to keep at home, so the first set will stay with the camping stuff (nestled inside the coffee pot to keep them from bending). I really should try gluten free English Muffins sometime soon.I found these rings to work amazingly better than the 'muffin top pan' for gluten free hamburger buns. There is really no comparison between the two: the rings work and the pan didn't. Plus the rings are compact, easy to store, and extremely lightweight. Get 'em."
3,Fox Run Muffin Ring,The product arrived in good condition and in a timely manner. But...after following the recipe exactly the english muffins don't turn out like what you would buy in a store. The insides are not airy like. Guess it takes lots of practice to acheive that texture.
5,They work just fine.,These rings work just fine. I use them to make crumpets with. The rings hold grease well to prevent sticking. I don't run them through the dishwasher though.
4,Prettier fried eggs,Bought these to use in fry pan to cook eggs. They make a much nicer presentation. They have to be greased. No rusting after several uses. Some leakage either from fry pan not being perfectly flat or rings not perfectly flat. Minor point. The eggs fit nicely on an English muffin and it's worth the little extra work.
2,You can find a better item,"I bought this item because of previous ratings, in fact I bought 2 boxes of these rings but when I opened the boxes they came in did I get a surprise, some of the rings wound not lay flat, some had sharp edges and in general they are just plain flimsy so the ones which were more oval than round could not be bent back into something resembling a round shape.Needless to say they are on their way back to Amazon."
5,English Muffin Tins,"They're awesome! They worked perfectly! Since they're not stainless steel they need to be washed and dried right away, which is no big deal."
1,Disappointed,"I also purchased my crockpot in order to make quick meals with a minimum of fuss as I have little to no time to cook during the week. I assumed that it would follow that crockpot recipies would be relatively simple and quick to complete, but not so with this book. The recipes required more time and effort that I was prepared to give. I never use this book."
2,check on order after one week,"The seed was good quality but the service was not. They thought they faxed the order but didn't. When I didnt get my order in 3 week I called and they turned it around to be my fault that I hadn't called earlier, instead of saying sorry we didnt fax it and give a discount or at least a coupon for the next purchase"
2,Too soft,The brush is too soft and it didn't really comb my hair well (was sliding on top without going closer to scalp. I guess it could be good for fine hair or for kids
5,masterpiece,My first exposure to Fassbinder and probably one of his bests. This movie is devastating and introspective dealing with difficult and thoughtful themes.
3,Stuck on the launch pad,The rockets fit so tight on launch tube that the air pressure produced by the bulb will not launch it unless the roclet is only put 1/5 the way on the tube. We have had others that were great this one was a dud.
2,Barely works,"My son received this as a gift. While the brightly colored rockets are cute, the air hose is faulty, so the rockets only go up a couple of feet. I am not going to pay to ship the whole thing back to get a replacement, so this is basically trash. (I messaged the manufacturer on Facebook and was ignored.)He also received Stomp Rockets--those have a rigid hose and work much better."
5,Better than the stomp rocket!,"I bought a stomp rocket (2 weeks ago) with the purple base launcher and it didn't last that long. It is still ""playable"" but the base frame fell apart not after long.This launcher is a lot more solid and hard to break - easier to carry around. It makes great rocket shots! You pay more for the long lasting value - should have bought this one in the first place!"
5,Using Opteka Filters on a Canon A640 Digital Camera,"The flters work very well with my Canon A640. Of course having to use an adapter is somewhat of pain, it is well woth it with the difference in the quality of the pictures."
4,"Good lenses, once cleaned","It's a wonderful pack of lenses, the UV does it's job, never use the FLD (that's what a white balance is for), and the PL does a fairly decent job.It's a good cheap kit, nothing fancy here.The only complaint i'd really have is that when they were shipped to me, i received them a bit dusty so i had to clean them off before putting them on my lenses."
3,"Ok, but easy to read","Not as good as the many other ""couple"" books we read, but it is set up to read one each night which is a short read, so it is easy if you're looking for something short to read with each other every night."
2,How about a practical antenna?,"The antenna, at least in Wichita, KS, has to be mounted atop the roof of the car! Or, at least, the antenna will not work with double-walled steel when placed underneath the headliner.So- this is a great radio for you el cheapo automobile with single wall steel panels.Oh well... it is the el cheapo satellite radio receiver... what should I have expected?XM satellite service is great! (Unless it is their signal that is just too weak?)"
4,Fun Roady,"This Roady is a ""must have"" if you live out in the boonies like I do. We chose to attach it with Velcro (but there are other ways) and it has worked out very well. This model is easy to install and operate. And it makes a delightful ""chirp"" when a favorite (stored) song comes on. I bought this one used. And I haven't had any problems yet. I don't expect any problems, either."
2,they will not honor warranty,Delphi XM Roady XT Satellite Radio Receiveritem has quit working had for less than 30 daysthey will not refund my moneyDelphi says they quit making this 6 years ago will do nothing about itwas new in boxhas 1 year warrantybut no one wants to be responsible
5,Nice ideas,"I thought the pictures were great, however some of the intructions were hard to understand. I managed after many tries."
2,Tail Fell Off!,"I got this while my cat was at the Veterinarian's sick. She showed a little interest, but seemed more scared of it when I pulled the tail & it took off. Much to my dismay, the tail fell right off the next day and there is no way to connect it back again- the string went all the way back in. It is still cute but maybe would be better if it was at least catnip filled."
2,Not so great...,"While there is some good information in this book, I found the author's style disjointed and a little odd, making much of the book difficult to wade through. Also, there's a strong emphasis on UFO sightings, so unless you've got a keen interest in that subject you might find yourself skipping quite a bit of the book."
5,Excellent,"This is a really good movie. Great action and good story. Thought provoking. Superb production values, directing, and acting."
4,The Zion Covenant,"I purchesed these books used, and received them within a week. They were in very good condition, as was stated in the description. I would buy from this seller again."
2,did not receive total order .... cannot review,"We did not receive the item we ordered (April 6) and paid for (April 8) until a few days ago (May 27), after we notified the shipper that the item was not received. Then he shipped a partial order to us. We are missing one book of the six (6) we ordered and purchased in early April.Please advise.Joe Upton"
5,This is the book that I have been waiting for!,"Last year I looked high and low for a good book on Latin American music but there seemed to be nothing around -- not currently in print nor out of print. But now this book comes along and it is great. The wonderful text is equally wonderfully illustrated, perhaps due to the author's position as a newspaper picture editor but she is wasted on such a task and should write more books.The detail is amazing and surely the product of some painstaking research. I won't grumble and gripe about how the book differs from one that I might have idealised but I will make two critisms. One is that it has no CD. Two is that Brazil is completely missing. These omissions are so obvious that I can only think that they were not oversights.All in all, not just a good book but a GREAT book."
4,Some extra spice...,"Great book for salsa lovers who want to know a bit more about the history and background of the sexiest, spieciest music and dance."
3,Maybe it gets better...,"I haven't read the manga, and unlike most of the reviewers I haven't seen the unreleased episodes. I can only judge Brotherhood based on this blu-ray set. Maybe it does get better but these thirteen episodes lack the depth and emotional impact of the previous anime."
4,highly reccommended,dot allison combines a solid series of beats with strong vocals that carry you easily through the entire cd.
2,Boooooooooring,"I had heard so much hype about Dot Allison, I ran straight out and bought the single ""Colour Me"" when it was released. I loved it...it was absolutely fantastic. Terrific slow but sexy bass groove, breathy vocals, and very soundscape-y. When Afterglow was released, I rushed out and bought it on the strength of the debut single. I quickly realized that Colour Me was easily the best song on the album and the rest of it was boring, sleep-inducing pabulum. I like to call it ""album filler,"" the filling you stuff in around the few good songs. It's far too shoegazey and not interesting enough for me. It appeals to some people, but I like for my music to actually have a pulse."
3,More hype than delivery!!,"When I first heard Dot an the radio... I ran out and bought Olive's latest release... silly me, I mistaked the two. If you like Mazzy Starr, Lamb, and other dreamy female vocalists... this one is for you... and check your morphine drip, because you will drift off. Otherwise, remember~ been there done that, lets not do it again!"
2,Beware of other reviews and summaries,"Contrary to what other reviews and summaries might claim, this edition contains neither the complete work nor passages from ""Paradise Regained"" (aka ""Paradise Found"")."
4,unusual coasters,Great for a gift or for yourself if you like unusual but usefull items around the house. Modern and colorful.
4,weird,well i got this and it works fine..u have to really jam the plug in the cigarette adapter to make it work which is weird and unusual but otherwise it tells me when i need to slow down ha ha
1,Hygrometer doesn't work non adjustable-unusable,"The spring type hygrometer never worked and is unadjustable. The spring type thermometer works sort of also unadjustable. Worthless plastic wall decoration, not recommended."
1,Do not buy!,When I recieved the product the temperature needle was bent so it was off by 3 degrees anyways. After using it for a day and a half the needle got stuck and never moved again even when placed in the freezer it would still display 89.
4,Good for the gym.,"The armband seems to be well built, but unfortunately isn't stretchy. It will definitely last a long time."
4,Works as advertise; can cause some skin irritation,"Short ans sweet:Works as expected, but the band can sometimes flip if not wrapped tight enough (which can cause skin irritation or feel too tight). It is sturdy, but the velcro can get dirty easily. Player fits snugly inside."
3,"fine, but better can be had","These are tenderly played and executed symphonies; but perhaps a little too tenderly and too strict an adherence to original practice technique. Take the magisterial symphony no. 92 as an example: well played, but lacking the excitement and incredible lush (and I may add, old fashioned) sound of Karl Böhm with the Vienna (nla). The introduction is stately, but lacks drive and passion and when the Allegro begins it is understated and under- whelming. I am no opponent of original instruments; I rather think Adam Fischer with the Austro Hungarian Haydn Orchestra maintains the drama and excitement of Haydn better though I have not heard him do these particular symphonies. For the bargain price I may be getting petty, after all they are played well and these are thoughtful performances but it may be a good idea to look elsewhere."
5,Good ole Irish History,Paddy Whacked would be a great replacement for many American history books. He covers a lot of ground when talking history and events concerning politics and the American public. And I know for a fact about many of these events as I am an old man and I've been there. I lived in Cicero when Capone ruled. I give it 5 stars.
3,Extravagent,I think this was exciting story but it was too long. You would have to read too much to find out too little about a character. I mean it was cool to find out all of the illegal activities going on in the Irish Mob but it was to little information spread out threw many pages which takes me days to read.The reason I choose this book was for a school project but it turned out I got some pretty interesting information about the Irish Mob from this book. The author goes to much into detail about unimportant people rather then the important roles in the story. This book is pretty violent and I wouldn't recommend it to nonviolent law abiding citizens.
4,Check out the debut of actress Carol DeSalles,"This film is perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon. Highlights include the debut of Seattle actress Carol DeSalles, whose strong performance makes up for the somewhat uneven script and camerawork. Still, the story line is decent, and the excellent music selections sprinkled throughout the film add considerably to the real emotion I felt watching it. At least one of the cuts comes from Virgil Brown's Smoke Rings album, also worth checking out.This film is perfect for a rainy Sunday afternoon . . ."
4,This song makes you feel cool,"I heard Titiyo's Come Along on the radio the other day and it was a cool experience. The song really makes you wanna get in your car and drive so fast as you can, wind blowing by. The guitar riff featured in the song is a good idea, it seems to mix all the genres and gives the song this distant feeling that makes it almost oriental.OK, I have to admit that this song reminds of the Swedish band KENT and female artist Moloko, but Titiyo's version is also made with a talent and sounds kinda fresh. Good experience and if the other songs in the forthcoming album are this good, we seem to have a new Moloko here. :)"
5,One of my favs ! An excellent Quality TOOL !,"Got this to ""fill out a set"" for myself and my Sweetie. It's my fav of them all; sturdy, yet flexible with a superb grip !!! Well worth the price, made w/ excellent steel !!!"
5,Fine Fun from Feinstein,"Michael once again gives us a fresh look at great songwriters. Livingston and Evans may not be the household names that Gershwin or Porter are, but everyone will recognize their classics like ""Mona Lisa"" and ""Que Sera."" Livingston plays piano on a number of tracks and shares a few vocals with the always mellow Michael, and Melissa Manchester makes a smoldering guest appearance. Some of the 23 tracks are wonderful songs we may never have heard, and even the theme songs from Bonanza and Mr. Ed are thrown in for extra delight."
2,Disappointing,"Blur was one of my favorite bands of the 90s. I particularly liked their Britpop phase but also enjoyed Blur and 13. (Leisure never really did it for me, though it had a couple of catchy songs on it). This new album is far from Blur's best. It's mushy, buzzy, and dull. I've listened to it twice now and none of the songs stick with me. Some of them already positively annoy me. If you are a real Blur fan, you will probably want to check it out yourself anyway, but if you are looking to start somewhere with this band, start elsewhere."
1,Absolutely awful,"I didn't really like Blur's greatest hits, but thought I'd borrow this disc anyway. Bad idea. Experimental is a good way of saying ""really bad"". This is a perfect example of that satirical line. They don't even bother having proper melodies. I guess one could say that they ""over-thought"" this album. The irony is that it was their best selling album in the US according to the album's Wikipedia article - I guess an unique/interesting cover can sell sometimes. This album makes me want to try writing music again."
2,Where are the songs????,"I started listening to Blur at ""Parklife"", caught up with their past on ""Modern Life is Rubbish"", loved their artsier (but still grounded) work on ""The Great Escape"", and followed their spiral into textures and sounds on ""13"" and ""Blur"". ""Think Tank"" is simply more of the same-textures, sounds, but....NO MEMORABLE SONGS! I strained to listen to the whole CD. It just doesn't do anything emotionally for me. It doesn't connect! I do like bands that take chances and try new and different things (""Think Tank"" replaced Hatfield and the North's ""The Rotter's Club"" in my car's CD player, for Christ's sake!). But what made Blur interesting in the first place was their songs! They were skewered songs, but within conventional pop song structures. But on ""Think Tank"", the songs aren't memorable. In ten years time, listeners will not remember Blur for this CD...they'll remember ""Parklife""! Sorry!"
2,Me and all Music Guide give it 2 stars,This sounds ok they sound like Radiohead however it was veryboring and I don't really like it that much.hard to understandLyrics 4/10 Production 9/10 Music 9/10 Style 1/10 Voice 3/10Overall=26/50-52% wich gets 2.5 stars roundown to 2
1,Why waste your time,"So, reading the other reviews I felt compelled to add my thoughts. Someone said earlier, glad to see someone from bean town getting props. What the heck dude? Mr. Lif. There are so many awesome artists from this area, don't spend your money on a band whose career has been made through disses. I don't like Eminem, but Benzino and the Made Men, have 'Made' themselves by jacking others fame. I like the guest work, but the guests are better than the group itself. Get there stuff. Guests can be useful but they usually show that a band is lacking talent when overused. I listened to this album and wished I could get my money back. It's not even worth selling, I wouldn't want to screw anyone else."
1,Not her best,"I love Crystal Lewis, but this was not her best. Not even close. I did not like the style or arrangement of the songs. I would pass on this CD. Get a different one. She has many good ones out there."
5,Jennifer's book review,I thought the book was really fuuny and the auther had a big imagination. I liked how the kids could be animals at a point and then be apples and then be kids again. I thought the book was really funny and I would have given it more than 5 stars but 5 is the hightest amount. The book was a really good fantasy and I really enjoyed it. o liked it so much I read it 3 more times. I would recamend this book to anyone who enjoy's a good lagh while reading!
3,It was an okay book,"I'd give this three and a half, but Amazon doesn't offer that. It was funny and weird, but I wanted more story and less math problems (I don't really like math). All in all, it was okay. Try it if you like math and wacky problems, but otherwise don't bother."
3,I love this cart but . . .,"I bought this cart a few years ago and I have loved it. I still use it and hope to use it for many years. I use it to take trash out to the road each week and it is very easy to get up and down my steps.The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because where the handle folds there is a cotter key that sticks out on each side of the cart. It is sharp. I never paid much attention to it, but one day my dog was running past it and she caught her leg on it. It tore her artery, nerve and stretched the cartilage. The diagnosis was that she would never walk on that leg again and I had to keep it wrapped. Then the wrapping started irritating her leg and we were scheduled for amputation. Miracle of miracles she started using that leg again on her own. The nerve reattached. The ending for her is good, but we had a few very anxious months.I now keep the cotter keys covered with layers of duck tape so that they are not sharp."
1,OH NO ANOTHER BOY BAND,"OH PLEASE SAVE ME FROM THESE BOY BANDS. THERE ARE WAY TOO MANY BOYBANDS OUT NOW. AND WHO IS THE WORLD IS C-NOTE. THEY ARENT EVEN FAMOUS AND NOBODY EVEN KNOWS WHO THEY ARE. N-E-WAYS THEY DONT SOUND GOOD AT ALL AND IM GLAD I DIDNT WASTE MY MONEY BY BUYING THIS CD. SO IF YOU REALLY WANT TO LISTEN TO A BOY BAND GO AND LISTEN TO NSYNC, BACKSTREET BOYS, OR 98 DEGREES CAUSE AT LEAST THEY KNOW HOW TO SING."
5,He is the most spiriually singer i know,"There are not much to say, I just feel it when Talbot are singing that he realyyy is a blessed singer. THIS is praise music in real."
4,use it at work,"We use this product at work. The lid is difficult to get on the container, but the product works real well!"
5,Very good beginner kite!,"The pull on this thing in a stiff breeze is just breathtaking!This was my first kite and boy oh boy, I am so glad I got it.The thing is constructed like a tank and can take a lot of abuse!Thoroughly recommended for everyone!"
2,The Fightin' Side Of ME!,"Well, unaware I purchased this CD at a local music store. I couldn't wait to get in the truck and pop it in, however, when I did I heard re-recordings of every song, what? That's right, there is no original on this CD and I absolutely hate live music. I went back to the store to return it and was shot down, you bought it, you keep it. I now sit here ...in debt with a CD that was nothing like I expected. Always, Always read the fine print on the back of the CD way at the bottom where no one would expect it. I love Merle, but this CD brought out THE FIGHTIN' SIDE OF ME!!! (I would never say I hate any Merle Haggard work so that's the reason for the two stars rather than one)"
4,doctors from hell,"A good history book, but more importantly , a reminder to all of us of terrible acts of cruelty meted out on prisoners of all sexes and ages,"
2,Dissapointing,"Quickly I will say that in buying this book I felt I was going to be reading about the Nazi doctors and their crimes. Instead I read a book about a young lady whom was a court reporter during some of the trials and what she saw/heard.True some acounts are harrowing and emotional but not enough to live up to the unworthy title of ""Doctor's From Hell"".I had a few friends whom stated they wished to read this book when I was done and I told every single one of them that it isn't worth their time. I'll tell you the same. There are plenty of books out on this subject that give you a real sense of what happned and the evil people whom were responsible.I was really hoping this book was going to live up to expectations but sadly it did not."
3,"Great book, sloppy editing.","This book was obviously well researched, and the author's writing style is authentic, engaging, and easy to follow. The content is engrossing (and also frightening). All told, the book is more than worth reading.My only critique, so to speak, is the editing. The book (eBook version, not sure of the paper copy) is very poorly edited, with some passages being repeated word for word (sometimes in the next sentence, the paragraph below, or a different chapter altogether). A lot of the repetition could have been avoided, and it does take away from the ""flow"" of the book somewhat."
4,Reissue of 1990 recording,I haven't heard Gardiner's version of the Seasons on Archiv (out of print) so can't compare. But this is as good as Gardiner's Creation. Kuijken's takes on oratorio material are always instrumentally a delight and this is no exception.Only black mark - no texts as usual with these Virgin 2-for-1 sets.
3,I love it... but baby doesn't,"This book is so cute and I absolutely adore it... it would be 5 stars if only baby was as interested :) He'll look at it, but doesn't really get excited at all about it (which is a different story for other books! He LOVES to read with me). He's a smart baby, 6 months old. I may try bringing it out again when he's older and see if that does the trick"
3,The book,"I love the book and the concept and my son loves the flaps, but it can with some flaps missing. Though I bought it used, I didn't think it would have some missing. That was the disappointing part. Other than that the book was dandy."
1,dirty south suckas,"keep your money in your pocket.this sucks.. the lyrics are wack, the beats suck. everything is sucky..."
5,This has been an execellent source of DW Information.,The book has given a wealth of information concerrning Data Warehousing in concert with Oracle software.My team has been utilizing this book as a study guide for getting all team members on the same plane of knowledge. The technical information which is presented has been right on target and accurate.The book is very well organized and easy to read. I find this book very interesting and hard to put down.
3,How did the Baby-sitters Club Suddenly get THAT Lucky?,"This was a good book, but unrealistic when it got to the part about how the Baby-sitters got the money to go to California. I mean, gosh, how many kids have you met that have won the LOTTERY?"
5,AWESOME!!!!!!!!!,The first book I ever read and it got me hooked on the series!! Good work Ann Martin!!!!!
1,Awful 90s version.,"If you know and love the original 1975-1977 TV series (shown on PBS inAmerica), then you'll hate this new dreadful version. None of thebrilliant actors from the classic BBC production took part in thismess, and it was justly despised by all fans and slammed by most UKcritics. The warmth and charm such talented actors like Robin Ellis(as the title character), Angharad Rees, Ralph Bates, Clive Francisand Judy Geeson put into the original series is totally missinghere. If you want faultless performances, theater-like atmosphere andgood quality television (mostly filmed on videotape, except for theoutdoor scenes), then you're best advised to wait for BBC to releasethe whole original series on DVD (soon please !!!) or stick with yourgood old VHS."
1,Hellish!,"OK, I admit I'm a fan of the orginal but, being aware that the original cast were not involved I approached this with an open mind. I came away with one burning question. Had any of the casting department actually read any of the books???The saving grace could have been the presence of Fiona Victory. In the (much lamented) absence of Judy Geeson, she could have made a very credible Caroline Enys. I have seen Ms Victory in other roles and know that she could have brought the right qualitites to the role. However, she was prevented from doing that by the dreadful screenplay.In short, my advice is stick to the books or buy the BBC series. This production bore no relation to the books and, had it not bore the Poldark name, I would never have made the connection."
3,How Dark and Dark It Grows,"The British dawdled about releasing this dubious gem to its unhappy public. Not surprising. There had been a petition to hire at least Robin Ellis and Anghard Rhees of the original series. Since this makes all the sense in the world and would probably have led to filming the final Poldark novels, it wasn't to be. The result is a 'new' Poldark who looks as though he's been stuffed and mounted for years and a Demelza (Mel Martin) who gives a game try but one keeps looking for that tiny redhead.For avid readers of the novels, not to mention those who periodically stagger under the weight of their VHS collection to reprise the original, this may be a necessity. And you can still rely on the beauty of Cornwall."
4,nice hat really cool!,awesome hat really cool so yeah pretty good and stuff and i like camo so it is even better than i thought
3,real wood,"Looks very nice and drawer went together well, but...as far as fitting it into the tower it did not go as well. I could not use the markings on the side and learned that it was better to use the up/down holes rather than the fixed or side to side holes. It took quite a bit of manuvering to get them to fit. MAKE SURE YOUR TOWER IS SQUARE! One of my towers was not and I really had to jimmy-rig the drawer to get it to fit (shims, pulling and pushing the whole 9 yards). Looks really nice once everything got put together and I like the look so much better than laminate or those crappy wire shelves."
3,Disappointing,"I love the other Philosophy products I've tried, and this received high reviews, so I was very excited. But it is just okay. The product is certainly of high enough quality, but I find the scent a little underwhelming and dull and, to be honest, the color completely turns me off. I haven't used it nearly as often as I thought I would, so I don't think I will buy it again given the price. To be honest, I'm happier with my cheap St. Ives apricot scrub from Wal-mart."
5,"""A really good cd,"" says Connor D.G.","I really enjoyed this album,it was just one of those cd's where you buy it for one song,and like them all.My opinion is that""Set it Off"" is the best.If your into angry yelling music you should defenitly pick this up!"
2,"Static X , an Honest Review (My Opinion)","Static X first grabbed me back in the days with, ""Push it, I'm with stupid, and Bled for days"". (Machine) grabbed me with, ""This is not, Black and White, Otsego Undead, and Structural Defect"". However, there are not many songs on this album that I can say really grab me as the old Static X of the past had done. I do like, ""Skinnyman"" being my favorite of this album, and have given, ""Otsego Amigo"" a fair liking without all the lyrical screeching would have been better, but it has a nice beat, ""I'm the One"" has a small part in my heart as well. Without offending I would have to honestly say in my opinion buy, ""Wisconsin Deathtrip, Machine, and if you have to buy another static x album buy Shadow Zone"" I really like, ""Kill your idols, and So"".. By the way Static X rules, I just hope they go back to their B*tt kicking days with push it, stupid, kill your idols, and this is not. Asta!"
3,Can't keep putting out the same album over and over,"This is a good album, not their best. It sounds so much like wisconsin death trip and machine. Shadow zone was the only somewhat diverse album they put out so far and also their best album so far. How many more times can wayne static ramble on in the mic and do his occasional screams. It gets boring after so long and that is why they need to change otherwise their record sales will continue to go down."
5,Great Memories,"This cd of The Stanley Brothers is FANTASTIC, it is a recording of the way that people used to be entertained before televisions, computers, Ipods, and video games, and The Stanley Brothers were in fine form as this was being recorded. I can hardily recommend this cd for anybody who wants to go back into time for a while or to learn more of how people lived back 60 years ago."
5,WOW!,"I am very impressed. I got hooked on the first Tribes late in it's life (3 months before 2) and I am loving every minute. All the problems I see on all of the message boards just boggle the mind. I see none of it. I did get the acclaimed UE error, but guess what...I bought a decent video card (Voodoo 5 5500 AGP) and it all went away. Full detail and I still pull 20-50 fps. Truely a great game and only getting better. I have an Athlon 750, 512MB RAM, Voodoo 5 64MB AGP, 8gig HD. Beautiful."
1,Make sure you have the best video card,"If you don't have the following, don't purchase this game (amazon just lists a 3D graphics card. That ain't gonna cut it):Peripherals: Direct Input game controllers supported 12MB or better video card Supported Video Cards: Pentium II: 300 MHz w/ GeForce & GeForce 2, Diamond Viper II, Ati Rage 128, or Pentium II: 400 MHz w/ TNT, TNT 2, Radeon, Matrox G400 & G450 Voodoo 3, or Pentium III: 500 MHz w/ Voodoo 2, Voodoo 4, Voodoo 5, Kyro Permedia 3If you don't know what your video card is, don't purchase this game because you probably don't have a good one."
4,3DFx Owners Beware!,"This game is terrible for Voodoo 3 3000 owners! upon installation it defaulted into OpenGl mode, The graphics were extreemly choppy, So I set the Graphics mode to Direct3D, that was a mistake, only because now it will not let me change back to OpenGL! if you do change it back, you will keep getting an Exception, causing the game to end. And GOOD LUCK trying to get any kind of Support from Sierra! their worse than Packard Bell was! (hmmm Packard Bell is no longer around, I wonder if that tells you something!) The Game has so much potential! Cranking the sound makes for an unforgettable sound experience, the world is probably beautifull if you have a GEForce. The control of vehicles and planes needs inprovement. If I wasen't such an Addict I would throw this game away, but I can see how with enough work, this could be one of the best game out there. (In my opinion Unreal Tournement is still the Best Game Ever Made!)"
3,"Funny read, but not exactly what I thought..","After reading the preface to this book, I thought it would be an account towards a real Chianti lifestyle in contrast to what Frances Mayes portrayed in ""Under the Tuscan Sun."" But as I read through this book, it sounded more like experiences Dario had with showing his clients around the region and the lifestyle of a tour guide instead of an honest look of Tuscan life. He writes descriptive passages about the clients, good or bad, which offered lighthearted reading, but at times it dragged on. The only portion that came close to producing something, I felt, close to the purpose I saw in the preface was his writing on palio.In all honesty, it is a funny read on the things people do while traveling with a tour guide."
2,does he even like Americans?,"Given his 10-plus years of guiding Americans on small, personalized tours of Chianti, it sure seems like Signor Castagno can't stand us. I'm sorry - there are three groups he did enjoy. One joined him in moral superiority regarding capital punishment, one toured with him multiple times each year, and one couple named their child after him.So, if you'd like to cringe and feel embarrassed and then angry (after rebuking his clients for characterizing Italians based on encountering only a few, he does the same to Americans), this is a great book. If you'd like to enjoy tales of an expat's experiences in the Mediterranean region, try Peter Mayle."
5,Bach: Violin Concertos,"I haven't had the chance to listen yet to this cd, but Amazon, for some reason, notified me via e-mail that they wanted me to review this cd. Just thought I'd let you know that."
3,"A pleasant movie, excellent for families new to Japanimation","My wife bought this film for our eight-year-old granddaughter, seems she got her love for anime at grandpa's knee. The story was simple enough for a child to enjoy without insulting their intelligence, and engrossing enough for me to sit through a few times. Good quality animation, likeable characters, and well written. I recommend it for the whole family. Parents need not worry that the children will be exposed to excessive violence or objectionable material."
1,"Robbed by Amazon. Bad disk, can't be returned.","I was watching this with my kids and we got about 3/4 of the way through it and the disk started to skip, then stopped working altogether. Amazon's return policy won't allow me to return it because it's 3 months old. I feel like I've been robbed."
1,I'm sure it's me but ...,"OK, I have this video that my 3 year old daughter absolutely loves, and quite probably can't live without. I swear, I've seen it more than 100 times, and I still have no clue what the point of the movie is. I'm just not getting it. I'm not trying to offend anyone with this, but it just seems to go on and on and on with an insipid dialogue that doesn't really lead anywhere - though admittedly, the animation is great. I'm a great fan of Kirsten Dunst, and I also own Princess Mononoke and I love it - so it isn't the voice-over, Miyazaki (or anime!) that I have a problem with. Sorry, but I can't give this better than one star."
3,Good but not great.,"The movie was a decent movie, but I like the other ones from Hayao Miyazaki better. This one is pretty good for a younger audience and ok for an older one. I liked it, but not enough to put it in my collection at the moment. Maybe it will grow on me, only time will tell."
1,Absolutely disappointed...,"This was the movie that made me re-think anime... This is my second copy of the movie and I was so disappointed with the audio. The dubbing was shortened, most of the lines that were missing are Jiji's. Almost all of the songs and background music were different.When you watch a movie and it leaves such a vivid impression you don't realize how huge a part the music plays until it is changed. It's like it's not the same movie anymore. I'll be pursuing a different version of this movie."
2,Not my Favorite Miyazaki,"I own all of the Studio Ghibli films and am a big fan of Miyazaki but I must admit that I was severely dissapointed in this one. While the animation was incredible (as always) the plot moved slow, the action was sparse, and the humor was horrible to the point that you wondered what the characters were even laughing at.One good point, the cats were really cute.Normally Miyazaki can do no wrong but this wold have been better off as a short.Great message, horrible delivery. At least rent this before you decide to purchase...I wish I did."
2,Had Higher Expectations...,"This movie could have been summed up in 30 minutes. I fell asleep several times trying to get through it, good sleep aid, not such a great film. I had way higher expectations from watching the other AMAZING Miyazaki films. This movie isn't a bad edition to Miyazaki's portfolio, but it's not even close to his best."
4,"Pleasant, Cheerful Movie","This is more of a children's movie. There's no deep meanings, or hidden agendas, it's just a pleasant, visually beautiful movie about a young witch setting out on her own for the first time.If you are in mood for something like this, it's a great movie. If you want something like this, but more adult, try Miyazaki'sPrincess Mononoke.If you want more movies like this, tryMy Neighbor Totoro, orThe Secret World of Arrietty)."
5,Entertainment for every age,I first bought Kiki on VHS back in 1998 for my son who was 3 at the time. I had to get it again for him and he loves it just as much now at 11 as he did back then along with my other two daughters. It's a great Miyazaki film with timeless animation and storyline.
3,Ok but not great,"The First Americas Series is a great series, however the bookForbidden Land is the only book out of the whole series that I didn'tenjoy immensely. In fact I found myself getting annoyed with the way that the book was written. Especially when it came to Karana and to Torka. The conflict between them was awful. Karana is protrayed as childish and Torka as this bull headed idiot. But if you can get past the way the author protrays these two main characters, it is a pretty good book."
1,one of the worst items I have ever bought in my entire life!,"I bought this item without looking at the review but figured since it's Oxo it would be good as I have several of their kitchen utensils and I am happy with all. I was soooo wrong! the instructions said not to soak in water or put in the dishwasher so I washed it by hand, placed it on the drain board and left it overnight to air dry. When I went to put it away the next morning the spade was stained so I washed it again to see if the stain would go away, and the spade started to peel; thank God I never used it to serve ice cream, as it was possible that some of the material that was peeling might have been consumed along with the ice cream. I returned the item back to Amazon for a refund."
2,Okay spade,"I've missed my old ice cream spade. KitchenAid has one that I wanted to try but never got around to buying. Mom saw it on my wishlist and found this OXO Ice Cream Spade. I was very excited. It feels sturdy, but says do not put in dishwasher on it. That wasn't a surprise because most ice cream scoopers are that way. However, after handwashing it once I have pitting on it already. This is a surprise. I like GoodGrips and have a bunch of OXO stuff. Wish i wasn't already searching for a new spade on the internet though."
1,less quality than old one,the old ice cream scoop lasted for years... i ordered a new one on line from the same company.... what a disappointment..the quality was not there.. the metal scoop pitted and stained within 2 weeks of use.
3,Not as good as other OXO products,"I do like the size of the scooper, but the silver scooper part is chipping. I am still using it because I like the size & weight of it, but disapointed in the chipping. The handle & grip is nice as are the other OXO products I have bought."
5,Good Grips Ice Cream Spade,"I had been looking for one of these ice cream spades for our son in law for Christmas, but couldn't find one that was reasonable. Found this one after Christmas...he will be receiving it for his birthday! Love these spades!!!"
2,all good fights did not manifest in ENGLAND,"AS MUCH AS I AM A STUDENT OF THE GAME I FOUND THIS DVD THE PERFECT PUNCH,LOST IT KNOCKOUT ABILITY TO SEND ME REELING WANTING MORE.THE FACT THAT ALL THE FIGHTS THAT WERE SHOWN WERE BOXERS FROM GREAT BRITIAN.NOT SAYING GREAT FIGHTS DIDN'T HAPPEN OVER THERE ,BUT THE PERFECT PUNCH DID NOT START NOR WILL IT END IN THE U.K, NOT WHEN TRUE FIGHT FANS CAN REMEMBER WARS THAT TOOK PLACE IN ALANTIC CITY,MADISON SQUARE GARDEN,AND LAS VEGAS.THE PERFECT PUNCH IS LESS THAN PERFECT WHEN IT ATTEMPTS TO COVER BOXING THE SWEET SCIENCE."
2,Confusing,"I thought there were likeable parts of this novel and appreciate the youth of its author. However, I thought the plot was too incoherent to enage the reader over its total length. By the middle of the book, I was fed up with Jessamy, feeling her to be more brat than victim. This wasn't helped by the ambiguity surrounding Tilly Tilly and her link with Jessamy's past. I also didn't like the lack of concern for poor Shivs - I wanted to know what happened to her. All these things combined meant I had litlle sympathy for any of the central characters who, at the end, I thought were a self-indulgent bunch."
2,A Little Trouble,"While it's admirable that Helen Oyeyemi completed this novel before she turned 19, it's also painfully obvious she isn't quite ready to deliver a consistently well-executed or written story. There are several hints of sophistication and insight, however the novel is hijacked by clumsy, awkward and amateur moments (where was the editor?) The storyline has great potential (the idea of a double), however it's never developed or ""tight enough"" to be believable or compelling. There's a severe lack of real tension between TillyTilly and Jessy and the numerous storyline coincidences are a stretch. The lack of focus makes the novel meander back and forth between teen fantasy fiction and adult fiction. I do believe that Helen Oyeyemi has potential, it's just not seen in the Icarus Girl. Better luck next time...."
1,Not secure.... unfortunately,"I liked the shape, size and everything about it EXCEPT that three of the compartments failed to secure tightly. I tried adjusting the lids to make it snap shut tightly but some of the compartments kept ""popping open"" even with a gentle nudge.Fortunately, the vendor refunded the money for the purchase without any questions. I would definitely do business with this vendor again but I would NOT purchase this item again b/c I believe this is a manufacturing defect. (My item was enclosed completely in the original packaging and had no dents, etc.)"
4,Great for beginners!,"I thought this was a great work out for someone who has never really exercised. It was easy and kept a great pace. I would recommend this tape to anyone who feels uncomfortable exercising and is just starting out. You can really do this work out anywhere! However, I did not like that I had to fast forward the tape for about 5 minutes to get to the actual work out."
4,eating good,"so far, have only made a few of the recipes in this tiny, but very full book. And all have come out just fine! Even my Irish Mother-in-Law found NO fault with the Irish Soda Bread scones. This pursuit of scones started because my sweetie fell in love with a local bakery's cherry scones, and while there is no recipe in here for cherry scones, I just made the buttermilk scones with dried cherries and he gobbled them down. No better compliment!Most of what we've found locally have been cookie like and he likes cakey textured scones (so do I). Here the recipes specially say which ones are cookie like.This is a tiny book, but as most reviews state, lots of good tasty treats! BUT this NOT for those who are looking to CUT their calories!"
1,More for your buck?,"I was interested in this cookbook but more so in the price. As I reviewed it, i found that the price on the back cover was $7.95. That certainly is less then the $9.95 you are charging. So what's the deal? Oh, I see there isn't one.I cannot comment on the recipes as none were shone and no pictures except for the cover. How about a bit more information?J. L. Stees"
2,OK,"I heard them for the first time when they opened for the backstreet boys in Portland .Their songs weren't that great but its kinda hard to judge when they are performing before the best boy band ever , 'cause those are pretty high expectatons . but they were OK , I guess ."
3,k&n air intake.,"in bougth this air short ram air cold intake for my crv 03.i was expecting for added hp and it did.it gave my honda more power to it but my gas milleage got compromise.it did not improve my gas milleage and its even less than i expected.if somebody want this to have a more power to your car its good,but if u buy this to save some gas,well,this wount do.stick to your oem parts.i like this but i wount recommend it to anybody."
4,A challenge for beginners,I first saw the ad for Zeus in an Archaeology Magazine and was curious. So I bought it and found it was real fun but also a challenge. It took me weeks to pass some levels. I took my copy to Venezuela and my sister loved it so I gave it to her and bought another one. Then I bought Great Empires 2 and that had Zeus so I gave my second copy to my niece. So I'm on my 3rd copy of Zeus. It's a game you can't get enough of.2011 UpdateI am currently on my 5th Zeus game cd as I recently gave my sister my old one. I have only 1 problem and that is that you need to keep this disc in order to install the Posedion Expansion Pack. I have changed computers several times and had to re-install this disc. Discs do get old and scratched no matter how carefully you keep it. I wish there was a Zeus/Posedion single disc that would solve this problem for me.
5,Room and Furniture Layout Kit,"Another lifesaver for arranging/re-arranging furniture, etc. A very useful tool for determining, with the least amount of lifting, where each furniture item should be placed. This set has a wide variety of sizes and shapes. It would be helpful to just about anyone wishing to see the finished layout without actually moving the furniture first."
1,Does not fit an RFID card,I read the product info (stating fits cards up to .30 mil) but had no idea what 30 mil was. This holder does not fit RFID cards. Waste of money.
2,Difficult to follow,"There is almost no cueing throughout the workouts and it is almost impossible to follow along! Also, this dvd requires much more space than I have, though I've always had plenty of room to do a Leslie Sansone workout (Leslie has excellent cueing and is easy to follow). I don't think I have gotten a good workout once when doing this dvd, mainly as I spend much of the workout trying to follow along. Denise does use some arm movements that were new to me, which I am happy to incorporate in to my workouts for variety's sake. All in all, very disappointed after doing Leslie Sansone workouts for 2 years."
3,Only ok,I don't love this video. I use it to break up the monotony of my Leslie Sansone workouts but it is not that challenging and I don't like the way she counts and sets up changes. Maybe I'm just used to the way Leslie teaches.
3,Quit the Pep Talks Denise and You Rate 5 Stars,"I'm glad I was not the only one who felt this way about Denise Austin relentless 'you can do it' instead of counting. Such a shame because if she ceased her condescencing chatter long enough so we can hear the music beat, this would be quite an awsome workout. If you can find a way to ignore her voice, it really is good.Denise let the music play (we got the DVD, I think it's obvious that, at that moment in time, we feel we can do it!)"
4,versitile workout,"This is a good video to keep variety in your workout. You can do one 15 minute workout by chosing 1 of the 3 workouts, or, you can combine them into a thirty minute routine. It is very easy to follow, as Denise keeps you motivated with her side steps, active walks, kick backs, and the workout with weights routine is a great workout. I would recommend this one to anyone wanting variety, and anyone needing to fit in a good workout in a short amount of time."
5,Terrific,The relaxed Mr. Como doesn't fail to imbue the Christmas season with the required relaxation necessary to enjoy the holiday.
5,So wonderful!,"Perry Como's music style is not only entertaining, but meaningful and soothing to those who want to reminisce the talents of a wonderful vocalist. Playing this CD and listening to those songs of yore, bring me back to a time when our Christmas celebrations were the celebration of the Birth of our Lord. This variety of songs will definitely enhance your thoughts during the Christmas holiday."
5,Excellent read,As always BJ is a master at story telling. I'm still plowing through all BJ's books. I'm always looking forward to her new books.
5,"Great product, quick shipping, thanks!!","Product came as described, clearly in brand new condition, packaged very well. Thank you!!"
2,not for small hands,"the armband for this nano sleeve didn't fit my hands - avg 108pound, 5'4 individual. Return involved a restocking fee. Not for all sized people."
4,"mostly good, could use some improvement","I've been pretty happy with this product, especially considering the price. My only qualm with it is that the elastic has started to loosen slightly after about a month of consistent wear. As another reviewer mentioned, it's hard to stick your earbud and cable cords into your Nano because the rubber on the bottom gets in the way. However, I just took a pair of scissors and cut a tiny bit away from the slits and it works just fine. When I'm not using the armband for running, I just slip it off, leaving the rubber case around my Nano to protect it. All in all, it's not built to last forever, but it's decent."
2,The armband is too big for those with slender arms,"I bought this product for my wife, and she'll have to work a lot more on her biceps before the armband fits properly. Would it have killed the Belkin Corp. to stich on an additional inch of velcro fabric?"
5,"Great, does exactly what it says, great price!","The silicone is great quality, fits the nano snugly, and the arm band is nice. Wonderful product, does what it's supposed to do, for a fabulous price. Recommended!"
1,Not for the real runner,"I could not believe it when I saw this in my ""recommended for you"" file! I bought one of these about 18 months ago and I am done with it.Now I run 5 days a week, usually for an hour or more. 30 to 50 miles a week. I use the arm band during warm weather when I don't wear a jacket. About 6 months ago it started slipping a bit and I would have to tighten it a time or two during a run. The velcro is just too cheap. Since the weather got warm here this spring, it's almost useless. It won't stay on at all. Nothing beats running a race carrying your ipod!This is not for the serious runner, or for anyone who has the expectation of it lasting for more than a year. There has got to be something better out there! And I'm going to find it!"
4,"good, but could be better","While the casing is definitely good - perfect fit, non-tacky looking, appropriately matched holes, etc - and it has the essential screen protector, my gripe with this product is the strap. It's certainly comfortable and is adjustable for a wide range of different size arms, but the range unfortunately starts at what is too big. If I make it the smallest I can, it *just* manages to stay on my arm. I have to wear it farther up my arm than I'd like just so i don't have to be constantly pushing it up so it stays on. I'm fairly slim and don't have huge arms, but they are honestly not that small.I guess I will have to do more bicep work. Or wear it on my thigh."
3,"love the case, but the armband is too big","i love the rubber case this comes with, i keep it on all the time, however the arm band doesn't go quite tight enough to effectively stays up. it stays...but not always and not very securely. though i'm a girl, i do life my biceps and triceps so my upper arm can't be that small...i guess this armband is made for people with larger arms."
3,Needs two prongs on strap adjuster,"I bought it for my iPod Nano, haven't actually used it while working out yet. I'm petite, and about 115lbs, my arms are not super skinny but the belt is just too big. The velcro needs to be a lot longer because even if it's tied snuggly, there's extra strap bulging. The strap belt needs to have 2 prongs that would allow the length of the strap to be adjusted (it only have 1 and doesn't help much). I hope it holds when i actually use it. Also, the actual holder of the Nano is made of rubber and you just slip the iPod in. I have a feeling that after a long time of using it, it will stretch and your iPod have a risk of falling out. =(."
2,Okay....,"I ended up returning this item. The armband and fit were perfect, but I didn't like the fact that there was no plastic covering for the screen and thumb pad."
2,Screen protector marred & armband too big,I had problems with applying the screen protector. The sticker ripped and won't come off of the protector blocking the top part of the screen. I had to remove the protector. The armband is much too large for my arm - the iPod kept sliding down my arm and I couldn't tighten it further. I tried contacting Belkin but they never replied to my e-mail. I returned it to Amazon - at my own expense of course.
5,Great,"this band is great. there is really nothing actually bad about it. of course it chafes a little and there's nothing to do with the extra bit of earphone wire, but which ipod band doesn't have that problem? the price is also very reasonable. i am very happy with this product."
3,Strap too big,The case for the Ipod works but if your arms are on the smaller side the strap is too big.It's also hard to lock and unlock your Ipod when it's in the case because the opening for it on top is very small.
3,Good for light use,"I bought this about a year ago and was happy with it at first. A few months, and a few hundred running miles later, it has not held up well.The silicone sleeve fits the nano perfectly, allowing access to all the controls and ports. The nano slides into the sleeve from the bottom, which allows you to attach a nike+ transmitter. It works great at first, but after some use the nano slips out of the sleeve by itself. After a while my nano slipped out whenever I ran. My solution has been to where the sleeve upside down - it works, but it's not elegant. The elastic strap has not held up well at all - it has lost much of its elasticity, and is much looser than it used to be, even when cinched as tightly as possible - it now slides down my arm on runs.Bottom line -- I think this sleeve is a good low cost, light duty answer. More demanding users should look elsewhere, or resign yourself to buying a new one every 9 months."
4,My 2 cents,So far it has filled its purpose. My only problem is that I belive the band should be a little bit wider for comfort. Other than that I think it's fine.
4,Works Great,Purchased this for my wife's Nano to be used while she works out and she loves it. No complaints from her - she says it's comfortable and it stays put on her arm.
3,Works well with Nike+,"I a 5K daily and use my Nano with the Nike+ system to track my progress. I also wander around a lot with my nano on a daily basis.Pros: cheap, works well during work out, easy to add/remove the Nike+ reciver , protects the nano from weather and droppage.Cons: It is starting to show I little wear and tear(6 month later), Hard to access the Hold slide, Band might be some trouble for women (works great on my arm, but I am 6'1 215lbs.) So anyone on the petite side might have some trouble"
1,NOT for 2nd Gen. Nano,"This sleeve is designed for 1st generation nanos...the 2G's sort of fit in it, but not very well. If you have a 2G, this is not a very good choice."
2,Disappointing,"1. The strap included with this sleeve is an absolute piece of junk. It is poorly designed, made of flimsy material and cannot be adjusted to smaller arms. I bought this for my wife, who is an average size woman and nothing you do with the thing will make it fit her arm. It is way too long and the velcro cannot be adjusted properly. Totally useless!2. The sceen protector leaves hundreds of tiny air bubbles after installation no matter how careful you are. I have no idea why other reviewer would say it doesn't leave air bubbles.3. The sleeve itself is of good quality and design. Nice to the touch.I bought it based on the positive reviews but they were wrong for the most part. I'm sorry I've wasted my money."
4,Excellent Reissue,"Originally released separately, these two discs can compete with some of the best harpsichord performances on record, and it is wonderful to see them back in print. While the acoustic can seem a bit distant at times, it suits Cole's instrument well. Listen especially to her playing in the Partita: the execution of the trills in the Prelude, the rolicking Courante, and a somewhat breathless Gigue. Like most performers, Cole omits several of the repeats in the Goldbergs (for reasons of space if for nothing else), which is a pity, since her ornamentations the second time around are so often excellent. With so many superlative recordings of the Goldbergs on harpsichord, it seems silly to give this one five stars, but the low price is an added incentive, if one is needed."
1,Pump fails after one season,"I have gone through three of these over the course of three years. These pumps do not survive more than one winter. They leak water, pump seizes, and warranty is only one year. For a good reason, they would be constantly exchanging people's failed pumps.I'm moving on to another brand, I recommend to stay away from this."
1,A waste of money,"I've been through 2 of these pumps in 4 years. Cheap construction and it constantly clogs. Spend you money on a heavy duty 2"" de-watering pump. $100 more and will last the rest of you life."
2,"Think twice before buying this pump, if your pool cover encounters freezing conditions",First pump lasted nine years and I never took it inside during freezing conditions. This last pump didn't make it through one winter. The seal where the wire enters the top of the pump didn't last. Oil leaked out and water entered the pump. Seams like a common problem after reading other reviews.
1,Doesn't work most of the time and keeps failing!,"I have had 3 in the last few years, right after the 2 yrs warranty fails, can't be fixed. When it works it just keeps clogging up from leaves. I talked with the manufactor who stated if frozen water gets in the pump, it is damaged. Don't get one if water ever freezes in your neighborhood. Also, for little giant warranty they will only deal the distributor, not the consumer. What a pain, and therefore the company does not have product registration online or keep a database of your personal product. The serial number only tells them when the distributor bought the product. Not a consumer friendly company, nor a reliable product for you pool cover needs! Think about some others."
1,Very unreliable pump,This is the third one of these pump's I have purchased in the past four years. The last two have failed with two months. I have since learned there are much more reliable pumps out there.
2,Miles Davis! but wrong period,"Mark Isham has the tone of Miles Davis down...But this music leaves me cold - Miles Davis, all right, but wrong period.I MUCH prefer Mr Isham's ""Blue Sun"" album, reminiscent of Miles, but songs of his own, (mostly). I really wish Mr Isham would do another Miles-like album like the warm & wonderful ""Blue Sun""."
4,My review,"The episodes on this video both really make you think. Not only are they both amusing, they also capture your heart. ""My Father's Office"" is a father-son episode, in which Kevin goes to work with his father and uncovers a few mysteries of the life of his father. He learns a few reasons why his father is the way he is. ""Angel"" is a funnier episode than the first, but it still manages to have a moral at the end and make you think. In it Karen, Kevin's older sister, has a new boyfriend, that Kevin discovers is cheating on her and Kevin tries to find ways to get rid of him. So if you're a Wonder Years fan, I reccommend you add this great video to your collection!"
5,This could be my family!,"Yes, they're dysfunctional, and yes they are all a little on the kooky side, but they are family, looked at honestly, bluntly and often tenderly. A wonderful mix of the terrors and joys of going home for the holidays. Why would anyone want to spend time with these people? Good question. Exactly what I ask myself each time I fly home to dreadfully similar scenes. The answer? Because they are family and love them or not, you can't leave them."
5,A Family Frenzy,"If you're looking to get into a serious after movie discussion don't rent this. But if you want to laugh and be reminded that your disfunctional family is actually like everyone elses, this is the movie for you. This was almost like coming home to my own Thanksgiving which always turns out to be the worst day of the year and arguably why my family is in so much therapy. This is the holiday movie for the 21st century. BUY IT!!! Oddly it's a pick me up after a bad day."
4,I usually watch this movie every holiday season,It is so funny and it always helps me get through the holidays.
5,Hysterical,Best Thanksgiving movie ever!!! Family tradition the night before the Big Turkey Day. This replaced a lost copy and although the cover pic was different same great movie inside.
5,America at it's truest!,"This is truly a peek into an American home. It shows the dysfuntions that all families, to a degree, have. Holly Hunter as the older sister, Claudia, who just wants to get through Thanksgiving with her family is phenomenal. Robert Downey, Jr. cracked me up as her brother, Tommy. Cynthia Stevenson plays a great neurotic sister, Joanne, and Charles Durning and Anne Bancroft are hilarious as their parents. It's great to see Bancroft in a wig and dowdy clothing. Geraldine Chaplin as aunt Glady is a hoot, and of course I cannot fail to mention the gorgeous Dylan McDermott as Tommy's friend, Leo Fish. Clair Danes has a bit part as Claudia's daughter, Kit, and Steve Guttenburg as Joanne's husband, Walter.Flashbacks of each individual's family lets you get a peek inside to see how they really are, when they get away from the tension of family. A definite must-see!"
4,Twist and Turns,This was a very good book I really liked it. The characters were real and understandable. Madison was a smart women who had some bad breaks in life but made the best of it. You won't belive what she goes through. (I don't want to give too much away)But buy the book it's worth the money.
5,The Best,This book is written extremely well and I recommend that everyone read it. This book is realistic and full of action. I could not put it down. I loved everything about this book and can't wait to read her other book. This is a must read.
5,realistic,"This movie is very realistic, to me and our life style. It`s one of my and my husbands very favorites. Super movie"
2,Dated and stupid,"Poor long-suffering overworked underpaid cops of the mythical 87th precinct ... none of them corrupt, none of them racist, all of them clever conversationalists. Here they again confront McBain's evil genius, the deaf man. Never occurs to anyone that witnesses that could identify him might need protecting. Also no one seems to think it might be a good idea to put his threatened victims in hiding, even after two of them are murdered. McBain presents the deaf man's harebrained scheme as plausible. What little good his beloved cops actually accomplish is by just plain dumb luck and bizarre coincidence.Was everybody really this dimwitted back in the 60s? How did this sloppy, uncritical, naive writer ever get his great reputation?"
4,Typical Ed McBain,One of the classic police procedurals. It was interesting to look back from today's prospective to a time with no cell phones!
5,Will be a Known Classic - eventually,A co-worker had this album and being a fan of Nerf Herder I borrowed then bought it. This is a great witty album! Love the music especially when the lyrics don't really match such as Bran Flakes and Health Food Store. If you don't like one of the ditties then no worries - it's only a minute long. No doubt this album will eventually get it's due - the originality of the concept and quality of the music will rise to the top like it deserves. Until then those of us who have it can look piously at those who don't.
3,Good but not a keeper.,"Not my favorite audio cassette recording of a Lavyrle Spencer romance book but Vows was good and I liked most of the characters but especially Tom and Emily, really the only character that I didn't like was Emily's ditzy friend Tarsy, well she started off ok but than became too whiney and obnoxious! Though not a keeper I did enjoy this audio cassette."
4,The best scanner book I've seen so far.,"I have several books on scanners and scanning, and I don't think any of them come close to matching this one in the clarity of the text and the illustrations used to make the point. The only drawback I could find was that I do wish the authors would all get together and use the same terms when talking about dpi, spi, lpi, and ppi. It makes it pretty difficult for us right-brain folks to be able to sort it all out. However, I still consider 'Make Your Scanner a Great Design Tool' to be very useful and a worthwhile investment, particularly if you are getting into doing any sort of image-tweaking for optimum results. I have recommended it to several artists who want to scan their work."
2,Men who can't love: how to recgonize a commitmenphobic man before he breaks your heart,I was not at all impressed with this book. It really did not give sound advice about men who are commitmentphobic. It had a lot of stories/scenarios but no concrete advice. Save your money. Don't bother buying this book unless you are fine reading about everyone's else's stories about men they went out with that could not commit.
2,Too small for my needs,"This is pretty and colorful, but if you have lots of medication or even large pills, this is not useful. The slots are too small to hold larger pills. The tray is really too small to count medicine if you use it for this function. If you are looking for something to sort your medicine for the month and a smaller amount, this is ideal for you. But if that is the case, I believe you are better off counting by hand. I'm having to order a different counter for what I need."
2,Worthwhile only for a new Hanson track,"I must admit. I only bought the album because I am a big Hanson fan, and they released a never-heard-before track for the album, ""Wake Up"" which is by far the best song on the album. There was only one other song that I really liked- ""Crush"" by 3Gs. Those girls can definitely sing some harmony. Other than that, it was just space-filling bubble gum. Now I may be a punk rock type of girl, but I do like pop once in awhile... and this was really trashy pop. But of course, this is a Disney movie. But if you're a Hanson fan I recommend...."
2,Bland Pop,"I bought this cd the day it was released for one reason and one reason only - Hanson's new song 'Wake Up,' which was, needless to say, amazing as all their music is. But I mistakingly figured that a soundtrack with the good taste to include Hanson would obviously have many other good songs. That is where I was wrong. Unless you like disgustingly bland pop music, don't buy this cd, except, of course, if you are, like myself and many other Hanson fans, buying it simply for their terrific song. All in all it was worth it for what I wanted, but nothing else."
5,Fantastic CD!,"I bought this cd shortly after the movie came out, and it is great! Supergirl is such a unique song and is sung with an excellent voice. I love Miracles Happen, it includes a harp in the song and really is cheerful and happy! Stupid Cupid is a funny song, and Mandy Moore's voice is like an angel's! I love life is definantly one of the best! I love it! The lyrics are cool! Hold On by B*Witched is worth listening too. All in All- the cd is worth your money and is great!"
3,Music for the market the movie was aimed at,"I wasn't aware that The Princess Diaries even had this many songs in it, some of them must've been cut to bits. Overall I'd say the music seems to be aimed at the same market, naturally, that the movie was made for which would be teen aged girls. I did like #3 Miss you more by BBMak,#5 What makes you different by the Backstreet Boys, and #6 Miracles happen by Myra (the video for this one is a different story, doesn't have much to do with the movie)"
2,Purchase the soundtrack only for HANSON,"If you buy this c.d. for no other reason, purchase it for Hanson's new song, ""Wake Up."" It's the only track that is worth playing in my opinion!"
4,some very funny parts...,there was definately some very funny parts. i thought that it was pretty good for a comedy. a little cheesy.
3,"Funny, but far from Ferrell's best.","Blades of Glory has flashes of brilliance and moments of real humor, but sags at times under the weight of script that feels like it was written by committee. Actually, with five writers on board, it was. Nevertheless, it's well worth seeing for one reason alone: Ferrell. He is Blades of Glory. Everyone else is purely forgettable, with Jon Heder putting on full display an almost complete lack of acting and comedic chops. Would a funnier sidekick have helped? Almost certainly, but Will Ferrell's does just fine on his own. Funniest moment? A Korean skating move gone wrong. Priceless."
1,Just Plain Bad!,"Ridiculously bad Will Ferrell project that is like a very long and bad Saturday Night Live skit! Very disappointing especially after Ferrell's Ron Burgandy, Ricky Bobby and Stranger Than Fiction performances. The movie is totally devoid of laughs and moronic, almost from the opening scene."
3,A pretty good movie.,This movie was pretty good. Not the best I have seen by far. I am not sure I will watch it again even though I own it. I love Will Farrell normally but in this movie I was not as impressed with him or John. I am glad I did not pay the money to go see it in the theaters. Definitely not a movie for children.
1,Can you give a movie 0 stars?,"I'm a big Will Ferrell fan, I like Jon Heder, I occasionally enjoy stupid humor... but this...This is one of the worst movies I've seen in a long time. It's a piece of garbage someone threw together, probably in about as long as it takes to write an SNL skit. I walked out of the theater wanting my money back or wishing I'd seen something that was at least mediocre. The last 20 minutes was the worst of all, and that's saying a lot.I highly recommend NOT buying this movie!"
1,Cancelled order to boycott Paramount,Thank you Paramount for helping prolong this HD media war with such a useless decision.
5,Good movies,I never was able to watch this whole movie on tv. It looked good from the parts that I saw. So I had to buy it. It came in some time ago and I just got around to watching it now. Man what a funny movie. I always like Will Ferrell's movies. I new I was going to enjoy this movie. I think everyone should give this movie a change.
4,The best stupid/spoofing/subtle comedy in years!,"Will Ferrell is a rock 'n' roll ice-skater with a whirlwind sex drive, a heavy-lidded gaze and an ego twice the size of his brain. Banned from skating after fighting with his by-the-book rival (straight man Jon Heder), they are forced to become a pair in order to continue. Several skating luminaries appear in cameos. First-time directors Josh Gordon and Will Speck can't quite balance their spoof of the skating world with the ""inspirational"" story, the villains and the love interest, but Ferrell makes up for everything with his flawless delivery, both subtle and outrageous. He has by now established a bona-fide comic persona -- a deadpan channeling of the adolescent id -- that ranks him alongside Harry Langdon and the other great screen clowns.Note: It appears that Ferrell and Heder did a little of their own skating, but the very difficult stunts were apparently done by body doubles with the stars' faces digitally grafted on."
4,"I named my fish, Chazz Michael Michaels & Jimmy MacElroy","As far as Will Ferrell goes, this is a solid 4 of 5 or 8 of 10...Step Brothers (Single-Disc Unrated Edition)is better andKicking and Screamingis the worst...This is in the middle.A definate own for any Will Ferrell Collection."
3,don't knock up the spiker's girl,this is vital. no less than 27 members of the local populace may die a horrible death because of your transgresssion! leave the spiker's girl alone. because after she's knocked up and the spiker throws her in front of a train he will take a terrible vengence on the rest of humanity. using spikes as his tool he will never forgive the wrong done to him. nothing can stop the spiker or assauage his anger. this movie is the story of his quest to right the wrong done to him. there is NO END to his vengence!
3,Tiny Book,"I should have paid attention to product dimensions in the description. From the photos, you would think it was a large, coffee table type book, but it is tiny. Its full of great photos and information, just very small."
3,Acceptable fan,"This fan isn't quite as attractive as it looked on the website. It has a swirl pattern on the glass globes and I either didn't notice in the photos or it didn't show up well. We don't like that swirl effect. Plus, my husband said it wasn't designed very well and was more difficult to install than other fans we've had."
4,Some reasons why,"Nukes in Space is a serious documentary as well as eye candy. For those reading the history of the era, it provides the larger media-culture background to the Cuban Missile crisis. It goes far to explain why Kennedy and MacNamara went for the various arms control negotiations that lead to banning open air nuclear testing and eventually the ABM Treaty."
2,Guess you get what you pay for,"Will it do the job, yes. But could be a lot better. First, the ratchet tends to slip with me, so that feature is useless. Your crimp will only be as good as the amount of pressure you can exert yourself. Second, the tool is much smaller that I anticipated. Hard to get enough leverage. For reference, my application was crimping lug terminals on 4 AWG wire. Not many options out there for a reasonably priced crimper, so I was hoping this would be a nice find."
1,They don't teach you anything!,I'm a big fan of pokemon and I really wanted to learn how to draw a Mew. This book doesn't teach you anything. They just show you a picture of Meowth and say draw it. They don't even give you the right steps. And you can only learn to draw about fifteen pokemon. Compare that to all the 386 other pokemon that people want to draw. Plus they don't show you how to draw Mew.
4,Perfect gift for pokemon fan,This was a big hit for my pokemon fan daughter and it was very inexpensive which makes it a double win! It arrived quickly and in perfect condition and the how to draw instructions are very easy to follow and a lot of fun. There's even a page just for coloring in the back. A great buy for any pokemon fan!
5,Gameboy Alternative,"My 5 year old loves this book. If he had his way, he would play Pokemon all day every day on his game boy. This is a nice alternative that taps his imagination and creativity. He also tries to get others to draw with him so they have a group activity that is relatively quiet, until they start describing the battles. I highly recommend for any child who already loves other Pokemon activities."
1,"Tiny book, not worth the price",I bought this expecting an actual book. What it is is little more than a few pages stapled together. It's more a newspaper compilation or a comic magazine than a book. Spend your money on something else; How to Draw Pokemon isn't worth more than a dollar.
3,A little disappointed,"I purchased this item thinking that it would be a good replacement for the diaper bag for quick changes on the go or just to have a diaper bag alternative to throw into the stroller. My brother and sister-in-law have the Babies R Us version of the Change N Go and I am much more impressed with that brand. The Sunshine brand fits only the wipes container that it comes with, 2 diapers and a travel or sample size tube/container of diaper cream/powder...any more and it's near impossible to fold up. I like the concept of the Change N Go but would probably purchase a different brand if I did it all over again. With that being said, the vendor I used through Amazon was good and got the product to me quickly at, what I think was, a good price."
5,Get this for the trunk of the car,"I keep one of these in the back of the vehicle. Stock it with some extra diapers and a the slim-size baby wipes box. The velcro strap makes it easy to keep it attached to somewhere out of the way. It's just large enough to be practical. Some pads are too large for use on the go, this one's just right.It's also good to pair this with a 'Bags on Board' diaper bag roll. That way you'll have everything in one place when you need it."
1,Look at other Coyote books,"I purchased this book on a 30 word description (not Amazon) knowing it would be about the Coyote right? The author talks about moving back home with her Female Partner, Holly to an old house. This means she is a Lesbian.She has two Lesbian books listed on Amazon and this is a different direction for her I guess. I have read many books and other than this one ,I can not tell you the sex habits of the authors. Anyway , after talking about Coyote and non Coyote things she is finally rewarded with a sighting. Out of 179 pages the total Coyote content is about one chapters worth .She does write about almost everything else. A bad condensation by me of her info is : Coyotes (female)and left over Northern Wolves(male) are mating and producing Big non typical Coyote's that act like neither species. Even at $0.12/Amazons price / I can not recommend your purchase of this book for Coyote information."
5,Fine Family Vewing,"Where has the Golden Age of Hollywood gone? It's available in one box. Bing Crosby and Bob Hope keep you laughing in this collection of endearing films. Bing Crosby woos the ladies with his Crooning, Bob Hope keeps them entertained with his sly wit. As the series progress they make refrences to their previous adventures, and they even take time to include you the veiwer in on the joke.The On The Road series of films revolve around the premise that Bob and Bing are broke knock around guys, that fall for the same woman (Dorthy Lamour) and the antics that suround them as they both try to win the girl and save the day.These movies set the tone for all ""Buddy"" flicks that have followed. A great set of movies for the family to sit around and watch on a Friday night. Don't forget the pop corn. I highly recommend this Box set."
4,What Happens When We Die?,Following the death of my husband I started reading everything I could get my hands on that might give me some insight into the transition that takes place at death. By far this was the best book I read on the subject.
2,A Big Buildup To... Nothing At All,"I was really intrigued when I picked up this book. I mean, who doesn't want to read about what happens when we die? I also read Mary Roach'sSpook: Science Tackles the Afterlifeand found it a tad bit disappointing.The buildup to the doctor's study results is definitely interesting. I like how he described the history of scientific investigations into the afterlife. Unfortunately, there was no real payoff here. The study was limited and he came up with no real conclusions. I would rather the author have written the book AFTER all of his studies were performed, not before. Overall it was a big disapppointment.If you're wondering what happens in the afterlife, Mary Roach's book is a good option to read. For Christians, I also recommend Josh McDowell'sMore Than a Carpenter. If you have a good book that deals with these topics, please comment because I would love to read it too!"
1,dissapointing,I would not have purchased this book if I knew it was about NDEs. I blindly purchased this book thinking that it was scientific study about 'what happens when we die'. Gave up after barely reading 40 pages.
5,good resource book / hospice,"As a hospice nurse, i felt that this was a good resource book for those friends or families that are on hospice. It really explains, rather well, what to expect during the dying phase."
5,Goshgarian Speaks of the Unspeakable,First time novelist Diane Goshgarian presents a coming of age story in the context of the Armenian genocide. Her narration of the harrowing experiences of our Armenian ancestors provides the dark backdrop to Victoria's movement from adolescence to womanhood. Twenty-first century Armenian Americans will recognize elements of their own ancestors' stories of their determination to survive. This blending of fiction and non fiction is a must read for Armenians and non Armenians alike.
1,This was not an original copy of the book,"This is a remote sensing text book, meaning that the quality of the imagery is very important. The pages in the book are photocopies of the original with a small section of color images inserted in the middle of the book.I would highly recommend buying this book in person to avoid getting a copy. Or buy directly from the publisher"
2,"A story, and a very dated one at that","This title is misleading; this is a detective story, written by the great Charles Dickens, not a series of pieces. The work is incredibly dated due to being written in ye olde enlishe (my little joke). I'd give it a single star but a) it's Dickens and b) you can actually see him again being ahead of his time in the thread of how he writes this, which follows a pretty familiar detective format to today."
2,"Very Disappointing: Not Beaches,Bars,Boats or Ballad Style","Never been disappointed in any Jimmy Buffett CD before... until this one. With the exception of 2 songs, the CD is 180 degrees twisted from his classic style beloved by parrotheads around the country. Think Jimmy's in need of a long carribbean vacation to refresh his lyrics and find the upbeat ""want to sing along to"", ""let's escape for awhile"" music that he forgot to put into this half-hearted recording."
2,This was very lame for Jimmy Buffett,I was very excited when JB's new album was released. I rushed out to buy it with high hopes of it meeting or beating Barometer Soup. It didn't come close. I was very disappointed. Now I have to wait for the next one.
3,A swing and a miss,"I like many of Jimmy's most recent albums -- ""Banana Wind"" and especially ""Barometer Soup"" are some of my favorites -- but as with all of Jimmy's albums, there's hits and misses. ""Beach House on the Moon,"" for me, is a miss, much as ""Fruitcakes"" was.It's entirely possible that he's speaking to another segment of his audience, although I honestly don't know what would distinguish them -- they like really clumsy novelty songs and songs that gaze so hard into Jimmy's navel they're unlistenable?I don't need his albums to all be bouncy bar rock -- one of my favorites, ""Son of a Son of a Sailor"" is almost entirely wistful -- but I do need to be able to connect with the music and lyrics better than I can with ""Beach House on the Moon.""I'd give this album a pass, Parrotheads, and pick up an earlier album you might have missed."
5,good ole Jimmy,We all know Jimmy Buffett has put together a supa CD. He's the absolute best singer/song writer I have ever heard. I grew up on Jimmy's music and that's well almost 14 years. Yes I'm 14 and am a parrothead (already)!! I love his music so much and the song I relate to on this CD? do you have to ask...of course it's MATH SUKS. I hope jimmy can put together some more great CD's. I would love to share his music(past and hopefully future stuff) with my children.
3,A fair album with a few good trax.,"Buffett's effort at changing pace lacks the energy of this years best (Steve Earles ""Mountain"" and Backstreet Boys ""Millennium"")."
4,A Mellow Buffett,"If you are expecting a typical Buffett CD when you buy this one, forget it. This is a much more mellow Jimmy with only really one typical song in ""I Will Play for Gumbo."" And ""mathsuks"" does sort of suck. I'm not sure where that came from. But I was really moved by the title tune which is obviously written for his son Cameron. And most of the others like ""Spending Money"" are just nice quiet mellow tunes which feature Jimmy's singing without so much background hoopla. I think it really shows off how his voice has matured over the years. You can preview if you want but I found that I needed to listen to the CD several times before I really appreciated it. And if you don't like the music, then just find the lyrics and read those. They are very poetical."
2,Kick-off your shoes and relax to this one {-:,"I've heard better from Buffett's older CDs, but if you're NOT into hopping on your feet and ""feeling"" the groove, it's a great CD to relax too."
2,Flat! No strong single cut to carry this album through.,"As a long time parrothead, I was somewhat dissapointed,if not bored, by the offerings on this album.This was a collection of ""fill-in"" tunes without a strong single song to carry the album.A non-exciting collection of Buffet ""formula"" songs."
2,"Weak Start, Decent Finish","As a loyal Parrothead for many years, I was more than excited come May 18th when Jimmy's most recect effort ""Beach House on the Moon"" hit the racks. After purchasing it, I ran back to my car in eager anticipation to listen to what I thought was sure to be a wonderful album. What I got instead was many uninspiring tunes including the title track, and a couple Buffet-worthy songs to close out the album.At first I thought, ""I haven't listened to it enough, I'll warm up to it"". Well, it's been a good 7 times through already, and I've yet to find myself impressed. A really dissappointing album for me, since I look to Jimmy to keep me warm during the long cold Chicago winters. This effort is just not going to do that. Good thing I've got another 20 plus albums by the man to get me through."
2,where are the steel drums?,"This album does not have that fun Caribbean style to it. You can't dance and drink that cold beer to this music. There is a lack of the steel drums that brings that fun summer sound to buffett's music. Don't stop the carnival, banana wind, fruitcakes, they all have that great sound. I hope that Jimmy does not end his carrer with this bed time story!"
2,A dissapointment to a true parrothead,"The album starts off brilliantly with the first four songs and the ""I will play for gumbo"". The rest of the album is run of the mill storytelling and mediocre music. I have been a parrothead for many years and like Buffet for his energy and his unique view of the world and his lush music. The album lacks all three and I hope this album is not look at future Buffett albums becuase he may lose a parrothead fan"
1,Useless phone,I am terribly disappointed with my RAZR V3c phone. I purchased it for the bluetooth capability and the size and color which are the ONLY positive features. The viewing screen is so small that I can't even read the time and it does not give the option to use larger font size. The battery dies about three hours after being charged even if I haven't used the phone. It does not give me the ability to automatically call back someone who left a message unless that person also has Verizon service. I am forced to enter a code in order to hear my messages and I can't find any way change this. I wish I had my old Sprint phone again.
1,4th Pink RAZR (Verizon Wireless),"I am on the 4th Pink RAZR in 5 months! First phone stopped working in 2 months -- just turned itself off and would not come back on. Second phone (it took Verizon 4 weeks to get it to me)the camera did not work. Then after 3 weeks wait, the 3rd phone's ""software"" did not work. The Verizon customer service is horrendous! I would not recommend the phone or Verizon to anyone!"
2,blah,"I have to say that when I heard The Broadway Kids were recording a new album, I was thrilled. But when I got the CD I was completely dissapointed. It may be because all the past BW kids albums, with the exception to the christmas one, was far FAR superior to any other albums featuring kids singing, but this one was just horrible. I don't understand why these talented kids resorted to singing recycled pop songs when there are so many other broadway hits out there. Aside from the song selection, the kids don't have that sound they usually have, the ""singing their heart out"" sound. Also that shulman guy has got to just move on, ""this I promise you"" is the most horrible song on this.I did however give it 2 stars because my 8 year old sister likes this CD a little bit and the BW kids do cater towards kids."
2,Not quite the worst...,"I had read several good reviews of this movie (and one bad one), so I thought I'd give it a try. I wished I'd spent the money on something else. If they were trying to make a dumb, low-budget 50's movie for Elvira to make fun of, they succeeded. It really looks old, bad video transfer, reel-change marks, cheesy effects and all. Nothing new or original here, nothing you haven't seen before, and done better. Save your money, I wish I had..."
1,Not a good indian cookbook,"I am indian and eat indian food all the time, so I was looking for a good cookbook to learn some new recipes. This is not a book for people who want to learn to cook traditional indian dishes, most of the recipes are made up by the author and are very far versions of the traditional indian dishes."
2,not ready for prime time,"Primitive menu systemChoppy output at HDWireless not quite fast enoughNO PAUSE BUTTON. If you stop the video, you get to start at the beginning again.Media Center software is at revision 0.01aIt's a good idea. Come back in 18 months."
2,"Good hardware, poor software","Bought this to replace a Hauppauge MediaMVP device I was using in my livingroom to relay video from my HP server machine (Vista64) in another room. Hardware seems fine, but the supplied software is spectacularly bad and I don't see many options available to improve/replace it.Am using it now mostly to allow the wife to easily find and show photos, but still hope to find some other software to allow me to use it more fully."
3,D Link Media Lounge,My first DSM-520 lasted 4 days before it died completely. Amazon was very fast in sending a replacement. It has worked without problems. The software needs a LOT of work. D-Link apparently has not heard of Windows Vista and is sending software for XP Sp2. The software can be run in compatability mode and works fairly well. D-Link tech support is dreadful and their reps have no knowledge of the products.
2,"freezes, loses ethernet connectivity","Ethernet connection to WMC PC, leaving the ""find media servers"" navigation page up, the server would disappear and reappear several times within just a couple of minutes. also, the playback freezes - sometimes it would recover after a few minutes, others a complete power off was needed to recover. folders would constantly disappear. i promptly returned this unit and subsequently ordered Popcorn Hour A-100."
5,Best thing since sliced bread,"I simply love this product. It's definitely not for nubes. If you want to watch high bitrate video (HD) you need to hook it up through Ethernet. I love the fact it plays a wide array of formats - AVI, DivX, MPEG, XViD, MP4 (you can encode movies with Nero Recode - awesome), WMV, etcListening to my mp3's couldn't be easier. The interface may not be as pretty as the AppleTV but it's functional and straightforward.I highly recommend this product, I've had it for about a year now and couldn't be happier."
1,pretty bad,First of all the item arrive with no antenna. Second since it didn't give a chance to change the setting I tried to download the upgrade of the software at that point it stopped working and it didn't even turn on anymore.Very unhappy with amazon for not completely delivered what it was supposed to be in the package content and for the item because it doesn't work
2,Groan,"Try to find a laugh in this film. I dare you. It's a tribute to the sappiness of the 1950s (otherwise a healthy and much missed era) that this sort of thing could be a box office smash. Poor Donald O'Connor. While he's making Singing In The Rain, he's stuck in this Universal ""B"" series that must have embarrassed him as much as it now embarrasses the rest of us."
2,South Park Sidetracked,"I'm a huge fan of South Park. The offensiveness of the show is funny, not offensive because they are equal-opportunity offenders: they are cruel and offensive to EVERYONE.But season 10 is South Park off-kilter. The show is very in-the-moment political and knee-jerk reactionary in almost every episode. In the commentary they even admit this: they were too focused on polarized politicism and responding to criticism.It has its moments, but overall it's a very poor representation of the series. To paraphrase, stealing from The Simpsons, ""Worst Season Ever."""
2,Stereo or Mono Audio? Rudolph was in stereo; are these too?,"That's my question that I hope someone can answer. Since a 1964 Rudolph has stereo audio, would a 1970 SC is C2Town also have stereo audio? Please advise. Thanks!"
5,The ultimate cool,"This album is my all time favourite. Although it must be said that some of the covers are not the best in the world, it introduced me to Vic's songs and showed that you can do great covers (not only pale copies)"
5,"A Good Start, but the rest depends on your style","This book helped me through the beginning stages of poker and a little more. Playing with his exact strategy online I won 600 dollars playing low limit hold'em in a matter of a week after reading his book. However as I started using his advanced strategy's I found it was a little outside of my style. If you don't have the discipline to sit down and play poker for quite a while (and fold the majority of the cards dealt to you) in the beginning stages of your game, leave this book alone it may drive you mad to toss away hands you normally play. But if you are looking to break down your strategy and build from a better base (and you have the patients to do so) this book is gold."
3,Decent enough,"Decent book, but having read Harringtons books on NL Hold'em I didn't think it was all that great. I play only NL Hold'em, so for people playing other types, it might be of good use."
1,One of the Worst Books on Poker,Play super-tight and worship the Phil... See? Now you don't have to buy the book.
2,Buy Another Book...,I am looking for a new one. I was slightly better than my poker group of friends and nothings changed since I have read this book. I hope I find something a little better next time I buy a poker book.
2,POKER STATEGY OR EGO TRIP,"Poorly written book. I'm an intermediate player. Have read a few books on low-limit / mid-limit holdem. Save your money and buy Winning Low Limit by Lee Jones.Phil's book, when he isn't plugging ultimate bet, he is plugging himself. Plus, his writing style is unorganized. Most chapters are filled examples of him versus the world, etc (of course, every example he won). Should be called Phil Helmuth's Home Movies"
3,i agree with the rest...,"i have no problems with this book per say. all of this advice is solid, especially for someone entering a casino for the first-time and doesn't want to lose a bundle. problem is phil makes his living playing no limit and most of the good strategies there don't translate to the limit games most of us amateurs.he goes into detail about how to bet pre-flop but is a bit skimpy on how to play 4th street and the river. if you want a great poker tutorial, read anything by sklansky."
3,Play Poker Like a Novice,"Hellmuth's animal/player types are useful and the book is easy to read, but beyond that there's not a lot of substance. Students of the game would be much better off starting with the core requirements: Slansky and Brunson, Caro for tells, and Harrington for tournament play. Hope this helps"
4,Hellmuth Will Help New Players!!!!!,"I feel that Phil Hellmuth's book will help new players learn the basics of poker and give them strategies that they may consider using in live games. Hellmuth's book will not be of much use to advanced players, but it is a good place to start if you are just learning the game or if you have just played for fun in the past and want to improve your overall understanding of the game. I think that Phil Helmuth did a great job on this book and it should be read by any aspiring poker player."
3,Buy only if you are a fan of Phil Hellmuth,"This was the first poker book I purchased but after comparing with other 'five star' books available, it does lack structure and substance. It is not a terrible book but definitely not the best book for a beginner.I can't believe Amarillo Slim recommends this book with a compliment ""Play Poker... is the best poker strategy book ever written. I only wish this book had been available to me forty years ago.""Endorsements work because I purchased it after seeing that on the backcover of the book, but never judge a book by the cover. Believe me, it is not THAT great of a book. They must be really good buddies...The other downside is, the thick book covers only 1/2 on Holdem, the other half is Omaha, stud etc."
1,Worthless dock,"The homedock deluxe is great if you want to be forced to use a TV to use your ipod. if you want to integrate your ipod to your stereo or your whole house audio system it's worthless unless you enjoy turning on a TV to use your ipod.Why DLO decided that nobody wants to use the screen on the ipod is anyone guess, but this dock is worthless for most users.get the Apple dock or the now discontinued DLO home dock standard. it does not hijack the ipod's screen and allows you to use the ipod without a Tv set."
1,needs improvement,"Apart from the needlessly large number of typos (""Undo"" for ""undue,"" ""wit"" for ""whit,"" are just a few of the more egregious examples) and such, there are just too many factual errors and problems with the story. It tries to be true to the era, 1893 Chicago, but the dialogue alternates between attempts at the period and all-too-modern phraseology. Are we to believe they said things like ""student ID cards"" in 1893? And references to the novels of HG Wells, who didn't begin his writing career until two years after the novel takes place, are plainly wrong. And there are the references to firearms, laboriously attempting to sound factual but again, just wrong. The author has someone shot with a Sharps 44 revolver, for example, but the Sharps 44 was a rifle. There are enough erors in the firearms references alone to make the entire novel's attempt at historicity to be suspect.Give it a pass, don't waste your time on this novel."
4,Disturbing....yet fascinating,"When I finished reading ""Truly Wilde"" I realized that the feelings I had were similar to those I had when I finished ""The Well of Loneliness."" From the very beginning of the book, I knew that Dolly was doomed - and yet, I had to read about her life, her decline, her frustrations, her brilliance - and though the truth was depressing, I had to finish.Joan Schenkar's book details an important part of lesbian herstory - a society that was part and parcel of the times."
4,Unique,"This is a beautiful and unique book. It is illustrated with block print scenes of nature beautifully designed in various earth tones. Free verse describes creation as it evolves, apparently guided by itself with no ultimate purpose other than to know itself through thought. Creation is described but no mention of The Creator."
5,DVD Il Volo takes flight,This DVD of the three young Italian tenors is really very good. The quality of the orchestra and the accustics of the Detroit theater made of it a very nice show to hear and watch.
4,good singers,"I haven't seen it, as I got it for a gift to a friend, but she liked it very much she said"
5,A True Experience,I can't get enough of these guys! I got this so I wouldn't have to go to one of their concerts - and now I want to see them in person even more! What talent these kids have. Each of them so different from the other (with marvelous individual brilliance) and yet when you put them together - they are just MAGIC!
5,You will enjoy immensely!,Excellent. Never heard of these gentlemen until I saw them on PBS and immediately ordered the DVD and CD. They will go a long way.Bh New Hampshire
5,IL Volo Triumphs,"The IL Volo DVD is fantastic. Just like being at the concert but, in the comfort of your own home. I have a front row seat.Thanks for your excellent service. I received my entire order very quickly, and in tip top condition."
5,Music lovers Delight!,These young Italian men are the best I have heard in a long time. I can listen to them for hours.
3,When good videos go bad on DVD,"I own both the Cats video(best play in da world!) as well as the Ultimate Edition DVD of Cats due to my obsession with the beauty of this great play however there were quite a few things that kind of irked me when I made comparisions to both. One I couldn't help but notice the Ultimate Edition(in my opinion's) totally butchering of the music compared to the video. What the heck is up with the whole adding of dog sounds on the Pekes and the Pollicles, I for one love the cats doing the barking themselves! That and I didn't feel the whole intensity in the music on the Rum Tum Tugger song that gets me dancin to it, I mean I could barely hear the awesome guitar solo. All the tempos to me and a lot of the great sound effects from the video were cut or changed. Anybody know why the heck was that? Anyway I personally think the Cats video edition is the better buy."
2,Miaooooow!,"Bah! Humbug. Did not enjoy this it all. Far too much dancing. Songs mutiliated by singer's interpretations. The music was interfered with too much as well. Why could they not leave well enough alone? A waste of money buying this DVD - well for me anyway. Deuteronomy's voice had no gravitas - too light a singer for this role. What happened to Growltiger? The only one I enjoyed was, of course, Elaine Paige, and even then sometimes... Maybe I am overly critical, being used to the original cast. Yeah Brian Blessed.Just my opinion after all."
5,CATS - The Musical,"I love this musical, I saw it for the first time when I was 8, now I'm 18 and I still love to watch it! It is exactly how I remember, but much clearer, I would recommend it to previous viewers and to families with young children."
3,The CATS Video,"Certainly a must for the fans, this video gives a pretty good image of the show itself. However the many close-ups make the many dancing bits very complicated, notably during Rum Tum Tugger and the Jellicle Ball. The cutting and editing is very miserable, people suddenly disappear and appear in the larger dancing parts. The music is very good, and although some verses have been cut out, the quality of the music is higher than on many official and unofficial recordings. A movie that can be seen many times."
3,cats the musical,good movie but the sound quality is very poor. had to turn the volume way up and it was still very hard to hear.
4,Cats: A Love/Hate Affair,"I really enjoy most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musicals, but this one didn't really interest me. As expected the music and choreography were great and the acting was wonderful. Where Cats seemed to lack was storyline. After watching the film, I'm not exactly sure what the story was about, other than a bunch of Cats. I have never seen Cats on stage, but it seemed the DVD captured the stage experience fairly well. Overall, good job on the music, dance, acting and transfer to DVD. A more defined plot is what would have pushed this to the next level."
5,Excellent! A must own video!!,"Elaine Paige is, of course, wonderful in the role of Grizzabella, the Glamour Cat! Ken Page & Sir John Mills (and Elaine Paige) made my heart jump for joy. I have never seen the stage play, but I have the CD (original NY cast), and I must say that there is no comparison! I enjoy the London Cast much more. Rum Tum Tugger is my favorite, but there are moves that he makes that some children should look away from! I would recommend this video to anyone and everyone! Even my 14 year old son wants to watch it every day."
2,The shallowness and rootless of the American culture,"This musical was praised so much by the press. So I bought the video tape. I'm deeply dispointed by it. To summerize, it's basically an aerobics, not even the great ones. It has no contents, ok almost none. The acting is 3rd rate. The performance of Elaine Paige, however, is the first rate. As the music is concerned, there some great pieces, but far from all. To keep your dream alive, don't watch it. By the way I know a great piece of music or art when I see one. This is not one."
3,better live,"I wanted to perform Cats from the moment I first saw it as a child. I have danced my life away ever since. Broadway does not always lend itself to video. The director would have done better to shoot the musical from a fixed point in the audience rather than trying to conform a stage play to film. The close ups take away from the genius of choreography and staging that made this a stand out musical. The costumes and ""cat"" behavior only work from the point of view of the theatre audience, this is the perspective the director should strive for. Unfortunately the director ignores the benefits of theatre production in order to deliver a uniquely video experience. If you are a beginner to Cats I am sorry you have this poor introduction. Please wait for the revival, it will come! As for me I will take Cats any way I can get it. I'm hooked!"
2,Buy the CD,"Only a die hard Cats fans will appreciate this video. First of all, theatre is meant to be viewed at a theater; you lose something in the translation of media. While have been successful presentation of theatre on video (eg. Les Miz, Into the Woods), this failed. If you are a true lover of the theatre and Cats, don't taint your ""Memory"" of the production by viewing this. Instead buy the CD, one of the previously mentioned taped productions. Or one of the many films that have been based on a musical/play (eg. The King and I)"
4,Fun and very Enjoyable,I loved the CATS DVD! I've never been able to experiance the real thing but this was almost as good. I was very pleased that they only added a few effects and that they stayed almost completly true to what can be done on stage. The place where they did add effects (Magical Mr. Mystofolies) was purr-fect. Not over done. In short I highly recommend it!
5,This DVD is wonderful!,"I also have both the video and the DVD of this fine movie. The DVD is much better quality, of course. Why does everyone want purrrfection? For those of us who had never seen this show before, it is as close as we may ever get to the stage version! So it has mistakes! What movie doesn't? (Besides, it's fun to find the flubs!) My favorite character is Mistoffelees (played to purrrrrfection by Jacob Brent). Who says these CATS aren't loveable? Up close you can see their expressions, and you can understand the songs much better! And I loved the costumes, that were NOT Halloweenish! I give this DVD two paws up! Thank you."
5,It was a great musical,"The costumes were great, the music was wonderful and the charicters were so realistic, like they were really Cats!!!"
5,CATS is the BEST!!!,"CATS is the best musical I have ever seen! The sets, the costumes, the music, and the acting -- all of this works together to make CATS a truly memorable experience on screen. I highly recommend this DVD!!"
4,Brilliant family entertainment!,"Having never seen 'the show', and having received several negative comments from others before viewing, I watched anticipating a let-down. My children and I watched enthralled. They are only young, but we loved the costumes and the wonderful characters of the 'cats'. True to say, there isn't much if any of a story line, bur as far as costumes, character and music is concerned it's a winner - we haven't stopped singing the songs, and it's opened up a world of musicals and poetry to my children who are as yet too young to visit the theatre. Hopefully, it will develope a love of the 'real thing' in years to come."
3,Mediocre,"There were some really talented actors in this video, but the play itself if terrible. Aside from ""Memory"" the music is terrible and the editing is beyond all horror. The show is plotless & pointless in general, IMHO, but there were many excellent performers who still put on a good show even though they didn't haev much to work with. Elaine Paige was spectacular, as was Michael Gruber & Phyllida Crowley Smith. Other incredible performances include Jo Gibb & Drew Varley. They were excellent, and THEY. WERE. NOT. DUBBED. Geoffery Garrat was dubbed because they wanted Skimbleshanks to have a Scottish accent. Veerle Casteleyn was also dubbed--I have heard--because she had just gotten back from Belgium and they weren't taking chances with the English lyrics. Though, from what I have been told, she has a great voice, too."
2,Pretty dull stuff on video.,"This ain't Live on Broadway where MAYBE this one-song-wonder might seem worth the price of your first born. It's flat and fairly lifeless on video. Elaine Paige and ""Memory"" are fine, but there isn't much more than that. Strictly for the kids."
5,Now And Forever - Elaine Paige,I have performed this show for over twenty-six months and I believe that it is the best music that has ever ben written for the musical theatre. It was a joy to sing the song Memory so many times at the New London Theatre in 1981. Iam happy that the show has been a success and speaking as an original cast member I hope the film will be a big success. - Love Elaine Paige
5,Cats - I Want to be a Cat,"What can I say about ""Cats"", Wow! This stage play put on video and DVD is amazing. I received the DVD as a gift, before which time I had never seen ""Cats.""One of the things I noticed was that it took me no time at all to believe the actors were ""Cats."" The make-up, choreography, and music outstanding! I found myself singing along with the cast. Makes me want to be a cat!This play also makes me question, were people at one time ""Cats""? Andrew Lloyd Webber has made a fan and a believer out of me. I found ""The Making of Cats"" an interesting documentary. The documentary can be found as an extra feature on the DVD.The whole family can enjoy cats. Can't recommend it enough."
4,Find your cat's personality,A must-see for all cat lovers and a great introduction to theatre for children of all ages. It was fun to look for my own cats personalities as each cat was introduced. Great music as always from Andrew Lloyd Weber.
1,very disappointed,"I was sooo! disappointed with this book. I gave it as a Christmas present to four of my children. Was expecting a good portion to be simple common recipes that were common in Cincinnati. Out of about 300 pages, I would probably try maybe 10 of the recipes."
3,Meh,"It was ok. I was hoping to see more images of australias landscape. That is the main reason I got a blu-ray player in the first place so I could see beautiful images of earth and such, not images of dirty aborigines and ugly tanker ships. (I have nothing against aborigines though)"
3,A So So Doc on Australia,"Australia has always been of interest to me. I have known some Aussies and they've always struck me as being laid back and eager to have fun. This travel documentary narrated by Russell Crowe takes you into areas of Australia you didn't know existed and explores the land and its diversity of people. I was disappointed in this presentation in that it was heavy on the people, especially those Aborigines in the Outback and the rural sheep and cattle ranchers, and light on things I expected to see but didn't. I wanted to see more of the South Coast, the Mountains, and Tasmania. Too much time was spent on a Vietnamese commedian who immigrated after Saigon fell, and a young woman swimmer in an iron woman competition, and a young female rancher in the Outback. Even though the photography and editing were superb, the content was lacking and I was disappointed. This could have been a lot better."
1,Unacceptable,This batch of botched disks has tarnished my image of this series. The whole production was in a class of its own until the manufacturing crew busted.
1,Italy Revealed and Australia Revealed will NOT play on xbox 360 HD-DVD player,"You've been warned... I called Microsoft and they said for now, they are aware of the problem, no solution yet, not sure if there will be a solution either. The best bet is to replace the disk and hope for Discovery Channel to have a correctly encoded disk for me. Bummer...From avsforum, China Revealed and Brazil Revealed both are working. I might have to return 2 titles I have from amazon.com."
5,Closest Thing to Squad Leader on a Computer,"For those who have played board wargames, the Combat Mission series is the closest thing going to Avalon Hill's Advanced Squad Leader in terms of comprehensive realism, but it doesn't require knowing notebooks full of rules because all that overhead had been integrated into the system. The developers accomplished this by melding a turn based plot/resolve system with a 3D CAD/CAM engine. After giving orders, watching the simultaneous combat/movement resolution is tons of fun. It works superbly for standalone game, PBEM or two person online play. The Mod community is supporting these three games with lots of additional scenarios and skins too. If you have a serious interest in WW2 tactical combat, (especially armor) you can't live without this game."
5,Great Reference for Old House Lovers,Wonderful book with very detailed information regarding architectual styles and construction techniques. This information is very useful for both the layman and scholar. It is written in easy to understand language with numerous illustrations and photographs.
1,Prophetic Poison,"Hardly any of these so-called prophecies from the Virgin Mary have come true -- absolutely none, on the dates that were given. Anyone who gives a five star review of this book should go back and reread it! Emotional persuasion is a powerful tool when it feels like love is the central theme in the book but this book is misleading. And although the author may believe she has good intentions, there is nothing good that can be gained from reading this book. I do have an open mind but this is pure garbage. Stop relying on others to guide you! Whether you are a Christian or an Atheist, the truth behind our actions will be the defining characteristic of our future and humanity."
5,Mary's Message to the World,I love this book! Perhaps a bit outdated but the message is clear. Simple and yet so powerful! Good read!
1,Heresy,"I purchased this audio book sometime ago and recently started listening to it. Red flags started popping up all over the place when she made statements about Mary that would be contrary to her basic nature. Many of the statements that she made, on my short listen, are in direct contradiction to Jesus' teaching and the Bible. I visited her web site and it became apparent that Ms. Kirkwood is a heretic. She is a part of some New Age movement. She further talks about reincarnation, that there is no ""devil"" -that Jesus faced ""His own ego"" during his forty-day stay in the desert, that Mary had other children, as well as other inaccuracies no matter what your Christian denomination or belief, is truly laughable. Check this site out about some of her beliefs:[...]Then do a search on her name and I'm sure you will agree with my summation. Annie Kirkwood's message will be immediately deleted! If I could give less than one star, I would."
1,A New Age Mary??,"If you trust the bible for truth then you don't want to read this. This book is full of false teachings and new age material... Aliens, false prophecies from Mary herself, (sorry Annie, but the prophecies you gave for the last few years of the millenium didn't pass) and even includes a chapter (the last one) from Jesus himself saying 'yes you have lived before' (the bible is clear on reincarnation and says we die once). The natural catastrophes she gives are so lengthy it's hard for her not to miss but still she did. Like other reviewers said this book was an obvious money making opportunity for Annie to prey on the Y2K crowd. BUT what now??? None of it came to pass so this book is obsolete."
1,Catholics who love the Church will shun this book.,"You do not have to get very far into this book to know that it is not worth reading. For Catholics who know their faith, the errors will begin to jump out at them immediately. It claims that Mary says all religions are the same, there is no hell, it doesn't matter what you do, you'll still get to heaven, Catholics worship Mary, the Church is hiding what she has to say, etc., etc. If one accepts the writings of this book, they must realize that they are in opposition to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Use your time to read solid Catholic books. Life is short, and eternity is very long . . . and yes, Annie, there is a hell."
1,"Poor design, hanger was scratched.","MAXSA Car Butler Wood Hanger1. Hanger came scratched -1 star2. Hanger section is wood and metal, but the mount is cheap plastic? Why?? -1 star3. Hanger section to mount won't secure, not a flaw but it was designed so it wouldn't be secured onto the mount and is a bit loose. -1 star4. Hanger is too close to my headrest. -1 starFirst of all, seller should inspect the product for scratches prior to shipping. Second of all, MAXSA needs to make the hanger secured to the mount and make the mount with metal or something more solid. Inserts should have rubber inserts to lower nvh. These are all simple fixes, I don't get why design something half way and just be okay with it. I'm going to give it a few days, but I'm most likely going to return this poorly designed product."
4,Great stuff,"Just received the hanger yesterday. Got it install within mins.It is close to seat so it doesn't take up too much room from the rear seat.The quality on the hanger is very nice worth 5 stars.Only 4 stars given because of the plastric tubes, too many and easy to slip it out of your hands because you need to put both sides in at the same time.I doubt they will have replacement tubs or insert, so have you lost it consider you have to replace the whole thing.Good luck"
2,Not For Luxary Cars,Looks nice but did not fit my Infiniti or Mercedes. Getting the metal one instead. Should specify manufacturers at least.
4,Great Goggles But...,"These are definitely the most comfortable swimming goggles I have ever used.. They fit great, but after awhile, if you don't create a lot of suction on your face with the goggles, water will start to seep in. Nevertheless, I would highly recommend them."
4,Great goggles,I have been swimming competively for 4 years and I love these goggles. They have a tight fit but you don't have to get raccoon eyes for them to have a good seal. A good affordable goggle for the swimmer.
4,Nice and compactible goggle,"Well, this one is really nice which I think, it is worth a little bit more cost for the new style goggle from speedo. The lens are all clear as standard. Nothing else much fancy."
3,Not stick well to the skin,Always get water in them compared with other glasses that don't get water at all. Maybe they are good for kids not for adults. I recommend you other glasses.
4,Good goggles,I use these to swim in an indoor pool with fairly dark lighting. They work well. They keep the water out and don't give me headaches at all.
2,Not very good goggles huge fog problem,"I normally use cheap wal mart 3 for 15$ goggles and thought hey it might be nice to get a decent brand/style these dont cost too much... WRONGfor the first use EVER after 20 minutes of swimming, ok nothing bad...then bam fog every 3 minutes i had to dip dip and dip........and still the fog came backits quite the horror story i would never buy these again or suggest them to a friend.First time using them and fog is unacceptable avoid this brand.2 stars for being able to keep water out i guess....?"
3,"Good Quality, but fogging after every lap","After every lap, I have to dip these in water to defog the glasses. Except that very comfortable. Giving 3 starts, as my main purpose to buy this is for anti-fog feature, in which it has failed."
3,Good but gets foggy,"These goggles are good at keeping the water out, however they tend to fog up quite a bit."
5,Swimming Goggles,"These goggles are only OK. A little piece of the strap ripped while adjusting the goggles after only wearing them twice. Overall, a decent product but I feel that they are a cheaply made in comparison to others."
2,Great until nose piece breaks,"These goggles feel great and give fantastic visibility. However, I've gone through 3 of these in the last month. One was lost (my fault!), and the nose piece (the plastic bridge) broke on the other two. Last night, the third of these was broken when I tried to put it on my head for the first time. More specifically, I had the eye pieces in place and was stretching the rubber headband to put it over my head when the nose piece broke in two places.Maybe I just got a bad batch--the two broken ones came from the same order--but it's unfortunate that 2 of 3 of mine have broken from light use."
4,Comfy goggles,These goggles are easy to adjust and much more comfortable than my old foam ones. They do fog up after being in the pool for a while which can be a little annoying.
3,they're fine,I don't know much about googles but these are not bad. The two problems I have with these is that they can be difficult to tighten and once you get them tight enough they hurt the areas around my eyes after about 40 minutes swimming with them on. They should make these more comfortable for the skin around the eyes.
1,POOR,"Sucked! Not a single good match, except the last match was a little good. Wanna see a good Pay-per-view, here are some suggestions: Canadian Stampede, Badd Blood, No Way Out, Royal Rumble '99, Valentines Day Massacre, Wrestlemania 15, Backlash, No Mercy, Armageddon, and most 1996 Pay-per-views."
4,THE BEST THING OUT THERE FOR PRINTING CD-R'S!!!,"(...)Boy! Whadda device...It's the best thing since recording CD's!!! I did a few discs and they came out good, as I darkened the print texture when I set my perferences. Don't be deceived, you don't need the PC Windows software as the built-in Qwerty keyboard follows with *relative* ease (Please read the booklet and get a feel for the unit first with sample discs til you get it right-for me it took no more than three CD's to get it right.) I like the data storage file built-in to the unit and the different font styles. The only draw is like many other reviewers is you need to have replacement cartridges at the ready as it goes thru ink like an SUV guzzles gas. But, you could also say it's the ""king of the CD printers"". Very Nice Casio!! Peace - JG"
2,Rather flimsy,"If you buy this, don't expect it to take any kind of rough handling AT ALL!!!!! The top came off after the third use. Before that it worked very well."
4,Cool but complicated little tool,"For those wanting to print directly onto CD-R and DVD-R media at a reasonable cost, this printer is for you. The built-in keyboard provides the means of creating relatively plain to fairly elaborate printed material. As noted in a previous review, however, this printer is not the simpliest product to operate or master. It is far from being user-friendly or intuitive. The manual is not very strait-forward either, so be prepared to experiment and learn as you go. Nonetheless, the printer produces results that are superior to felt pens and more permanent than those sticky labels that are hard to center and lay flat."
3,better for PC users than Mac users,"Clever and relatively simple solution for printing directly onto a CD.Software, however, is only for PC/Windows users, not Mac.Annoying that ""optionally available"" aC adaptor is NOT on theenclosed order form for replacement ink cartridges.Was able to print basic label onto disc within 5 minutes of preparation,however quality results VARY depending on what type of disc you use.Be prepared to experiment. Ink cartridge refills, by the way, caneasily be found at lower prices than shown on amazon.A ""good"" and relatively easy solution for beginners -- which is what I am --but definitely not the kind of quality I'll want to stick with as I becomemore sophisticated creating discs for self and for gifts."
3,Sophmore Slump,"As disposable fiction goes ""Likely to Die"" is entertaining enough, but not as successful as Fairstein's first mystery, ""Final Jeopardy."" The culprit this time around is no surprise, nor is his/her reason for having commited the murder in the first place. The letdown of the ending doesn't quite justify the book's length, which is padded with too many scenes of Alexandra Cooper (the feisty prosecutor heroine) lecturing -- and I do mean lecturing -- at various posh affairs about the prevelance of sexual crime in our times. Not an unimportant message, but not one that we need to hear over and over. Still, Fairstein writes relatively well, and the book is never boring. I just wish it had had the type of surprise ending that her first book had. After all, isn't that why we read mysteries in the first place?"
4,very interesting book,I just finished this book and the ending was great.It had a few slow spots but it is really a good book.This is the first book I have read by Linda Fairstein and I now want to read her other book. Even though it is a novel she took the crimes from true life
3,Some thoughts,"I love Linda Fairstein books, however she drags the story line a bit. I feel there is too much descriptive stuff, like when police and detectives are meeting to discuss a case, she describes the entire room, and what they are eating, and who is there wether they are involved in the story plot or not. I would just like to see the story move a bit faster."
5,Likely to Die,"Linda Fairstein never disappoints. Love the lead character Alexandra Cooper but get frustrated by her as well. As an attorney, you'd think she was smart but she always seems to do what she's told not to in order to stay out of physical trouble. Does she listen, NO. It's annoying. But I cannot stop reading."
4,YOU CAN'T DEFY LOVE!,"I don't read too many historicals but this was an excellent book in the same vein as Woodiwiss and others of her era. The hero was so tortured and hurt but the heroine kept bringing him back from the brink of destruction. He showed her his bad side so often and tried to leave her but he kept coming back like a moth to a flame. She was a widow with a child and I usually don't care for children in stories but this ""young man"" fit perfectly. A wonderful read for a rainy afternoon or in front of the fireplace in winter."
4,Helpful,"This product seems to help a little. It is better than feeling drowsy and sluggish, the effects from a real anti histamine."
2,It did nothing for me,"My title says it all. I took it for almost 3 entire months and it did not prevent me from getting a cold. However, it may work different with different people."
2,Didn't really work,I heard that this would be a replacement for my over the counter allergy medicine. It didn't really work as well and you need to take a lot of capsules frequently to see results. I don't have the time to take that many pills that frequently. I'll go back to the 12 hour allergy medicine.
5,D-Hist keeps me clear,This is a super product. Helps keep my sinuses clear and trust they have been put to the challenge this season in the very dry Midwest!
3,Was there an editor involved?,"A very interesting book in spite of the fact that there didn't seem to be an editor involved. Many successive paragraphs were completely redundant. On the whole, I'd have to estimate that roughly 30% of the book could have been eliminated. Why didn't the editor catch and eliminate these blatant redundancies? I cannot stress the importance of eliminating redundancies. In addition, redundancies should be eliminated. Hah!"
3,I bought this book for TPI knowledge.,"I agree with most of the other reviews. If you have the spare coin, get this book and read it.However, if you dont ever read this book, you will not die (nor will your engine).Theres some nice tips and tricks in here. But nothing really profound. Lots of bolt on combination advice that I suppose is sound.I bought the book because I am building a TPI motor. This book did help me understand how the TPI can and cant be modified in terms of cams and heads. Ofcourse, any mods will require a PROM tweak. He mentions this but doesnt cover it, understandably as its not within the scope of this book.One thing ive learned over the years. When you get advice from the top dawgs like Lingenfelter, Yunick, Edelbrock, etc.... the advice is geared to build max power at a screaming 6000-8000rpm (or so). For me personally, this advice is amusing, but not at all useful. I only ever build strong daily drivers (that must be efficient). Never seeing 5000rpm, much less 8000. lol"
3,disappointed,"My husband purchased the 785 from Sears, here in FL. We had never experienced any problems until recently during the Memorial Day weekend that the 80 minutes CD-R's did not work on this unit. After going to about 10 stores in 2 days and realizing that the only CD-R's that work on this unit is the Memorex cd recordable 74 minute cd's. Not to mention that none of the main stores in our area stock those anymore, so we decided to get the Memorex 80 minute CD-R cd recordable cd's and before we could even get started recording it stated ""rec error"". So, if there is someone who can email me and let me know what 80 min cd's work without any problems, I will gladly appreciate it.."
5,Great Product!,"I have to say with my unit...I have No Problems what so ever!!It records fantastic using all major brand (Audio) CD-R's and (Audio) CD-RW's.Maxwell, TDK....I love this machine! To anyone having problems playing back their CD-R's or CD-RW's NOTE that a lot of older machines don't have the capability to play them and It doesn't matter where the CD-R or RW recorder or computer it came from.The sound is fantastic! Great Buy! You Will Not Be Disappointed! Pure Digital Bit by Bit Recording too!!!!!"
3,"DON'T buy at the Mall Kiosk - well, maybe...","I bought the kit for my wife at the Mall kiosk after the guy 'accosted' us for a demo. The buffing block was very effective (although I can do just as well with a three-grit polishing stick from Squadron Shop), but the big selling point was the cuticle oil and the hand lotion. What closed the deal was when he threw in a second kit for $10 - in effect, selling us two sets for $60! Now THAT was worth the price, I thought.But I'll tell you right now, if you don't get the second set for $10 offer, keep walking."
1,Not For Me,"Well he says that 2002 is a year of palindromes - get it? MC Paul Barman comes across as just a showoff smart-aleck. This CD is not at all musical, nor poetic, nor inspired or inspiring. What do you get when you take away all that drives a great hip hop sound and just go through the motions with your thesaurus in one hand your hanky in the other? This CD."
5,Great scent,"At first my wife didn't think she would like the perfume. It was too flowery or strong, maybe both. She gave it a try several times and it really wasn't as she first thought. The scent really softens nicely as the day goes by and the scent is very nice. My wife wears it everyday now."
4,Good film...,"I bought this movie upon the recommendation of a friend. Glad I did. Have shared the story with several frinds over time. I see something different each time I watch it.I lost a lover 5 years ago.It is a moving story of friends and lovers and the good and not so good in us we don't let anyone but our closest of friends experience. It is an accurate take on relationships, both in and out of bed.It's great to see a movie where the gay character(s) aren't psycho or totally flaming (although, there are a couple of guys who do spontaneously combust.) The people here are more like people I know.The film was very well done and the characters engaging; some more likeable than others... like in life.The sound was disappointing; otherwise I would have given it 5 stars.I would have purchased it on DVD if available."
2,Tedious and disjointed,"This film has good intentions and gets off to an interesting start but quickly collapes in on itself. First of all, the characters, except for the lead, are basically all unlikable and uninteresting. And I'm sure to the chagrin of many gay viewers, they all end up having sex with each other (no wonder we are talked about - not all gay people and gay relationships are this way!) The major problem that I had with this film was the confusing time line and flashbacks. In many instances, it is hard to tell at what point something is happening and you are wondering if it is after or before the previous scene. Another problem is extremely poor audio (even on dvd). Pluses are good acting and imaginative cinematography but these points alone fail to make this film recommendable."
2,A misfire ...,"It's hard to be critical of a movie so well intended, but we've seen it before and done better. Acting is good, but even on the dvd half the dialogue is lost."
1,No redeeming qualities...plaid is so out!,"Unfortunately, I have no praise for this film. On a purely technical level, the movie was so dimly lit and poorly filmed I could barely make out any faces. The script was trite and meaningless; an attempt at causing catharsis by forced emotion from second-rate actors. If you want to make a film, make one with a message other than ""pity this guy, he lost his lover."" I found no point to the film other than to depress the viewer."
2,Boring!,"A gay man recalls his relationships with past lovers and friends, most of whom have died from AIDS (or in one case, suicide). This might have made an interesting film fifteen years ago, but Green Plaid Shirt was made in 1996. By then everyone knew what spreads HIV infection and how to prevent it, so we don't feel much sympathy for the film's characters who chose to have ""open"" relationships (and, obviously, unprotected sex).On top of this, the film's audio is virtually unintelligible."
3,So-So,"I wasn't able to watch this in one viewing. It just didn't hold my interest. But I finally made my way to the end. Everyone in this movie did a decent job acting, except for Brooke Shields. She again showed why she hasn't had any major roles outside of Blue Lagoon and Pretty Baby."
3,Inexpensive tool,I reviewed this tool and then went to Goodwill and purchased an old butcher knife. I ground the knife into this shape. I have used it several times and it works great.
5,She's Too Young,"I have seen this on Lifetime from the first time it premiered to the next couple times it came on. I only watched it because I heard Miriam McDonald from Degrassi would be playing Dawn.I think it proves a good point to teen age girls like Becca, Hannah, and Dawn that are living in familys that seem too perfect or family's like Dawn's who have mother's that act too young and don't put up a good example. I give this movie 5 stars and I can't wait to get the DVD on March!"
5,Amazing!,"This book was an amazing read! I laughed, I cried, I yelled. This is by far Mrs. Jenkins best work."
4,a proofreading disaster,"I agree with the other reviewers that this book is great fun to read. But apparently no proofreader did so. This publication is absolutely RIFE with typos, punctuation gaffes and distracting errors. SpellCheck isn't enough, Thomas Dunne Books - a live human needs to proof it, too."
1,Truly Disappointing,"This DVD, while aiming to shed light on the Dutch resistance, instead focused on the recollections of a few brave people. It couldn't decide whether it was a love story or a documentary as it jumped back and forth, maddeningly re-using again and again the same images of a train track clickety-clacking toward doom. If you cut out all the visual filler, the story is thin ideed, which is too bad, because it could have been tightened up and enriched with maps and timelines and statistics relating to the positive impact brave resistors had on the survivors and on the war. The individuals' stories, while compelling, were not enough to make this a DVD worth watching."
1,Why not USB 3.0?,"This product has potential for specific applications such as attaching a large flash drive or external hard drive to a notebook computer with limited space arround the computer. However, the current standard is USB 3.0 and large USB 3.0 flash drives and hard drives are affordable, available, and faster. Why would anyone buy USB accessories for USB 1.0 or 2.0 except for old and/or slow equipment? With USB 3.0 capability, I would give this product five stars."
4,Great while it lasted,"I bought one of these at Radio Shack because the wireless mouse adapter connected to my laptop kept getting hammered. It worked fine for a couple of years. Then it developed an intermittent problem that caused all my USB ports to be flaky - not just the one it was plugged into. That, and the fact that the problems persisted after removing the Flex USB, made it hard to diagnose the problem. At first, a reboot would make everything work OK for a while, but the problem got worse as time went on. Eventually, I took out the Flex USB, reloaded the USB driver (again), and rebooted, and the problem was gone.This is such a useful device that I'm going to have to buy another one. Unfortunately, this Amazon vendor is the last reasonably-priced place to get it, and the shipping charge is pretty high. Radio Shack doesn't carry it any more (I tried a couple of stores.) At least now I know what to do if it goes bad in the same way."
2,Competent drawings of freeze-frame stills from rented movies,"Most of the examples in this book are re-drawn stills from classic, famous or easily recognized movies and shows: Potemkin, T2, Stagecoach, Gone with the Wind, Citizen Kane. So basically it's somewhere between ""drawing off TV"" (aspect ratios vary) and a recapitulation of ""Shot by Shot"", Stephen Katz's excellent book. It's hard to get permission for the original boards I'm sure, and nobody expects Mr. Katz to simply showcase his portfolio -- but his selections neither impress with detail and virtuosity nor provide a comprehensive overview of the craft and business."
5,Great Set,This is the only set I have of the Violin Concertos. I love this set. For the price you can't beat it.
3,Traditional type music,"Song selection was good, but found the recording tinny and lacking (sound) depth. I returned it"
2,"Uh people, cats iz cats....","Ok, I'm very scared. After 30+ reviews, I'm very worried that a majority of Tanya Huff readers believe their cats to be people too.Summary of this book: Love traingle with dominant female character set in a psuedo-fanatasy setting. This book may be more arresting for the N.A. contingent in Canada who like to make fun of Newfies (tres fun indeed!), but more plot depth and/or characters I could relate with may have been better.Basically this book mimics Ontario province in most ways non-Canadians see it...."
4,Wonderfully entertaining,"This cute story was so engaging I didn't want to stop reading until the very last page. I adore stories with talking cats and the cat in this book was absolutely hilarious! I kept eying my beautiful cat and wondering if she was just too smart to actually talk out loud! Crazy...sure! I will definitely be searching out more books from Tanya Huff. Witty and imaginative, just the ticket for a lazy, hot summer afternoon."
3,Romance Novel????,"I wasn't sure if this should have been listed in the Genre: Romance. It was a good read, but it certainly seemed to me to be a glorified romance novel. I don't think I will bother buying any further novels of Huff's."
5,One the FUNNIEST books I've read....,"I love this book. I got it from the library for the second time last week just so I could lend it to a friend. It's one of the those that I'd but and give out for gifts. Oddly enough, the scenes with Hell or some of the best."
4,Should be 4 1/2 stars,"Tanya Huff's Summon the Keeper didn't disappoint. Claire is a Keeper, a race of beings that keep the balance between good and evil. She's been summoned to a rat trap of a bed and breakfast. She thinks she'll patch up the hole and be on her way, but things don't quite work out as she planned. Her plans are further complicated with the hotel's employee, and young hot male, and the sexy resident ghost.The characters are fully realized, even the talking cat. The only unbelieveable bit is having a male around that will cook and clean without complaint. Where can I find one of those?"
3,"Good book, but not at all like the movie","The book was an inspiring story, but I was expecting more stories like the movie. The real couple is certainly more inspiring than the movie couple."
4,Inspirational,A little repetive but a really good story. I enjoy reading books before seeing the movie that was made from it. It is great to read true stories about how God has affected the lives of others.
4,Inspiring,"I enjoyed that to this day miracles happen by the grace and love of our Lord. I would recommend it to other Christians as well as noon believers. I don't think there was a thing I disliked, but I would have loved to hear more of krickett`s voice throughout the story. I especially loved the photos of the family and couple."
3,The Vow video by a reader and movie watcher,Liked the book so much better. The movie was only good because of the male actor Channey. A lot did not follow what was in the book. Family helped out a lot more and i liked that better
3,The Vow,"This book was pretty good, but a little slow at first. I still recommend it though. The movie was still better I thought."
1,boring,"I'm glad that at least the book wasn't too long. As a book club pick I had to read it, but I was hoping it would be a more elaborated story, I surely hope the movie is better, but don't feel any desire to watch it now. I really was glad to finish with it in an afternoon."
3,The Vow,"This book is very inspiring. Although, I was expecting the story to go more in depth about their lives, I did enjoy it."
4,Inspirational/ long,"I found the story inspirational but felt like I could have gotten that from the movie, all in all it just wasn't a ""page turner"" for me I feel like it didn't really let me get to know the characters."
5,"Husbands, get this book for your wife","I purchased this book for my wife after seeing the Carpenter's story on NBC's ""Dateline"". It is a touching story of how one man will go to regain his wife back.I have yet to read the book, but I can assume my wife loved based on the fact that she finished the book in one day."
3,I liked the movie better,"The book was very slow compared to the movie. Although, it was okay, it was hard to read through.Tina"
3,ok,ok..but very disturbed with the kindle edition with the photos in the middle of the book pretty much gave away the whole story ...so I didnt even bother finishing it...... poorly done
1,So disappointed,"Was so disappointed in this book - for the first time in my life, the movie is a thousand times better. The writing was amature and at times, uninteresting, and failed to get into the grit and the heart of what happened. With a story like this, if it was well written, the audience should be in tears and, well, I kept reading to find out when that time would come. No emotion. Would not recommend to anyone. Go watch the movie - you'll enjoy it much more."
2,"Limited ""best-of"" CD","This CD is an overview of Discipline's first three I Scream Records releases: Love Thy Neighbor, Nice Boys Finish Last, and Saints & Sinners. Two tracks from their two I Scream Records EPs, Hooligan's Heaven and Everywhere We Go, are tacked at the end.This CD complete ignores the bands Lost & Found Records catalog: Bulldog Style, Guilty As Charged, and Stompin' Crew EP. To be fair, the band sound changed significantly between Bulldog Style and Nice Boys Finish Last, completing the transition from hardcore to street punk/oi.My rating of two stars is based on narrow focus, not on the quality of the music. Discipline is one of the best street punk/oi bands in the European scene. The CD is a good introduction for those unfamiliar with the band. But for those who know how great Discipline are, skip this and buy the full lengths. (Finding copies of the two OOP I Scream EPs are not that difficult. Check around on the web.)"
4,Excellent primer on the subject,"Mr. Eftimiades' book is over ten years old and yet probably remains the single most helpful introduction to the subject. His book covers the organization of the various Chinese intelligence agencies, their function, and several illustrations of how they collude to gather information for the People's Republic. Eftimiades is well-connected to the U.S. intelligence community and so can be considered somewhat of an expert, along with Bill Gertz and Paul D. Moore.What is tragic about the book is that it was written before the public came to hear about China's intelligence operations through the Los Alamos incidents with Wen Ho Lee. Eftimiades' insight into that amazing story would be interesting, I'm sure.I recommend this book to anyone interested in China, in espionage or intelligence in general. It is worth the large sum of money you most likely will have to pay to read it."
1,Disappointed,"I purchased this primarily because I wanted to hold it in place with the straps. The straps are too short if you are above average in size and the buckles fall off easily when you try to adjust them. The instructions say not to heat the insert over 2 minutes, but it took at least 4 minutes in my powerful microwave to get it even close to a therapuetic level of warmth. It did not retain good heat as long as some of my other micro packs."
5,Great book,This book was good for children and adults alike. Very well written. It has become a cult favorite in my house we cant wait fourth next one to come out.
4,A few issues with camera,"Compared to my Sony F828 for taking long distance shots the photos taken with the H7 have far less digital noise. One complaint is when attaching the adapter ring and the flower lens hood, you can't take a photo with the flash without getting a half moon shaped shadow area at the bottom of the photo. The flash is just not high enough. So without being able to use the adapter ring I cannot protect the lens with the protective filter. The picture quality is very good."
3,Murder at the Brown Palace,This was a wonderful read. It has plenty of history and photos of the actualcharaters. It was an opportunity learn a little something about the city of Denver.Murder at the Brown Palace: A True Story of Seduction & Betrayal
4,What Were They Thinking?,"As I read Murder in the Brown Palace, I found myself muttering again and again, ""What were they thinking?"" This ill-starred love quadrangle: Isabel and John Springer, Frank Henwood, and ""Tony"" von Phul - through incredible naiveté or lack of common sense - could only have ended in tragedy. The author sticks to the meticulously researched facts and resists ""filling in"" or extrapolating when the historical record is silent or lost. The attorneys, the judges and the old Brown Palace herself have riveting roles that might seem outrageous today, but maybe not when compared to the shenanigans of the O.J. Simpson trial. And to think all of this happened in Denver at a time when she thought she had outgrown her wild frontier reputation. Not so!"
3,Adultery doesn't pay,This beautiful socialite was not satisfied with her older rich husband. She was having an affair with two younger gentlemen. Their jealousy lead to one of them murdering the other. The beautiful socialite was ostracized by society and she died an old drug addict. Good book!
5,From the Files of Madison Finn #09: Just Visiting (Paperback),a very good book from children 10 to 12 to read. This book is extra intresting because Madison gets kissed!
2,not up to snuff,"The guys have lost their fire. They were a great great power trio that could jam endlessly. But after allen woody's death, the guys have almost become a vegas act. I bought this album but hardly listen to it. In my opinion, deep end I was much closer to mules initial vision. If you want to see what they reall are about, get the Roseland Album.At their best, they absolutelt rocked!But here, they fizzle....gopher Gravy? really!!!"
4,"Beautiful, mysterious ancient music","This is an album of mysterious, beautiful music that transports you to the late 15th Spain. The music is rich, sensual, and relaxing. The music is sung in medieval Spanish ( which sounds quite a bit like Portugese crossed with Italian), and has an exotic, very middle eastern quality to it. Other songs exhibit the beginnings of Spanish folk music. I am a writer currently writing a book set in the time period and find this music a great, relaxing companion while I write my novel. Four stars!"
3,The Snobbery snob already knew all this,"Epstein covers many areas exhaustively, showing just how many different ways you could be a snob in regards to: food, family, money, career, material items, name dropping, schooling, clubs, intelligence, race, religion, politics, and more. Though Epstein explains at the beginning that he is merely trying to share with the reader his own faults of snobbery, at times it comes across as his genuinely being a snob! Though I suppose it is probably hard to be specific about, say, names you namedrop, without actually namedropping.Some of the tidbits were good, but overall the book was rather uninteresting."
4,Review Low,Why so many stickers on the CD? They are always difficult to remove without hurting the CD cover.
3,Please enter a title for your review,"this is their most experimental, and as the title implies, percussively focussed, album. after their last album where they attempted a more conventional rock style with mediocre results i wasn't expecting much, and the use of experimental drumming in the forefront of most of these songs marks the most amateurish musical output from this band yet. you'd think alan's mastery of the ""slowcore"" style would translate into some above average aptitude at music in general, but the experimental drumming on this album feels like the fumbling first steps of a rookie. assuming alan is responsible for most of the drumming, i dunno. the main redeeming quality is the one thing they haven't changed, the vocal harmonies, which is what puts this band still head and shoulders above the trendy indie scene of the 2000s. i recommend the album Long Division as the best example of what this band is capable of."
4,I loved listening to this disc- It's fun,"I know the Dude worked really hard on this disc, and I'm pleased to say I think it's really great. The songs are fun to listen to and very melodic. And the Dude's voice sounds better than ever. I wish more people would listen to this disc."
3,Beautiful cover,"This book was quirky, fun and attention-grabbing, all the references to fruit/seeds was original, but it didn't do a lot for me as I read it."
3,Yet another Christmas Carol,"This movie was good, containing good characters, but Isn't sociaty tired of the Christmas Carol Plot? It has been done MANY Times. The Flintstones, The Muppets, All Dogs go to Heaven, 101 Dalmatians, and the list goes on..The Story starts when Anita gets Fired by Cruella on Christmas Eve, making the Dearly's undable to pay for the Presents for the Dogs and Each other. Then Cruella is visited byt three ghosts (Played by Cute-as-a-button- Cadpig, Spot the Chicken, and Rolly).. and you know the rest."
5,Anne of the Thousand Days/Mary Queen of Scots,I've been waiting for these to come out on DVD for years! I was very excited to finally get two of my favorite movies in this format.
4,Needs more,"A good start to producing the animated series on Dvd. But, this needs a lot more extras. Extra episodes, extra extras, like deleted scenes, watching the actors rehearse, or reading the scripts would be fun, interviews with the cast, and, since this is for kids :) maybe a few dvd-rom games.There's just so much more they could do with these DVDs. I'd like to see them take advantage of the opportunities.Kevin Conroy is awesome. He IS Batman. The artwork is near flawless. I am so drawn into the entire ambience, that I have to catch myself, remembering this is a cartoon. It's not live action. Which, after the dismal Batman & Robin, it's very easy to understand why the animated series seems like live characters, and Batman & Robin seemed more cartoony than the animated series.Despite the shortage of episodes and extras, I still give this 4 out of 5 stars, or a 92 of 100."
2,An okay encyclopedia on serial killers!,"Encyclopedias are suppose to have be brief and summarize the crimes. This book is no different since it doesn't have or go into explaining in detail about each crime but that would take volumes. The book does offer references and a list of serial killers from around the world. It's not just an American problem but serial killers come from all walks of life, nationalities, religion, ethnicities, and race. The book is just a brief summary of each of the most famous and some infamous as well as unknown serial killers who are not written about as much."
2,China Dynasty,"This video has all the great HD quality in 1080i, but I was not too thrilled after viewing, it is basically about urbanized China, little on nature view. Excellent picture on cities; however, if you looking for landscape, mountains, terrains, etc.. for your HD TV, not recommended, because you will see none and disappointed."
5,Reading Strategies for Nursing and Allied Health,"This book was delivered within 3 days of ordering and is in pristine condition, loved it! Great experience!"
4,small,"These are great masks and a size small fits my 10 year old son. This will not even fit my 5' 0"" small girlfriend. An small adult will need a medium and pretty much all guys will need a large."
5,WAGER WITH THE WIND,One hell of a book. The all time greatest bush pilot ever but I would find some place else to buy it. Amazon dosent treat there customers very well!
4,One of he best,"Don Sheldon was one of kind, and one of the greats of Alaska aviation. He was a pioneer without doubt on Denali. A good job by author James Greiner. If you liked this book, you will also like,FLYING NORTH SOUTH EAST AND WEST, by Captain Terry Reece This book covers not only Alaska aviation, but polar expeditions, cargo flying world wide.Flying North South East and West: Arctic to the Sahara"
3,A little romance and a lot of action.,"My husband had me read this book. At first I was skeptical, but really got into it. The love scenes between Jim and Maggie were very erotic, but not vulgar. I especially liked that the women were strong and capable. The violence was necessary because of all the terrible things and people the characters had to deal with. All in all, an entertaining book that also has a message about our rights to say and be who we are."
2,"Simplistic, Often Obvious","If you're relatively new to Bob Dylan's production, this will lay out its album chronology and give you some insight into songs. A much better book for this is the Rough Guide to Bob Dylan, which provides more information with a sharper edge. If you are looking for a broad and factual introduction to the man-myth, you'll be much happier with the Rough Guide, which is great for beginners, and still useful to those more deeply immersed in Dylan."
3,Disappointed,"To be honest, there are several things I dislike about this bag.First, the carrying capacity (length x width) of the main pocket of the bag is inadequate for comfortably carrying many common items you would normally take with you when going out.Secondly, the things I dislike about the bag are the pockets use Velcro, and the front pockets are too small. I would prefer button up pockets compared to the Velcro. The Velcro seal itself seems weak and may accidentally open. The front of the bag has two small pockets, the pockets are too small to really be able to use them resourcefully. The side pocket you could possibly use them to fit a small water bottle, that's about it.To sum up the dislikes, carrying capacity is inadequate, Velcro pockets, and the front pockets are too small.The few things I do like is the strap seems durable, the material is durable, I do like the interior pocket inside the main pocket which is useful.The bag isn't horrible, but it isn't that good either."
4,Great bag but has some flaws,I've been using this bag a lot as a camera bag. It doesn't have padding but everything fits in it so well and it is very comfortable. There are lots of little pockets and even the top flap can hold a tabletop tripod.The main problem with this bag is that the front velcro pockets don't stay closed and I've lost some stuff. The side pockets seem fine though.

1,My Niece loves this loom!,This is more than a toy. It opens up a world of arts and crafts. My niece made an awesome purse and is now interested in weaving!
1,Confusion !,"I read Maitlands' other book about spinal manipulation and found it well written and informative. The book impressed me enough that I bought Spacious Body. I have my undergraduate degree in Philosophy and Heidegger was my main interest. I was excited to find a book by a fellow bodyworker who was heavily indebted to Heidegger. Unfortunately, this book is a mess: poorly written and unduly difficult to comprehend. Stick with his Spinal book."
1,What's that? Oh yes... utter bollocks.,"Some clever bits. Chappelle does a decent job, but Breuer is a disaster. That ""stoner"" bit gets old mighty quick. I know that's his ""thing,"" but, Come. On. It's just not funny. No. Really. It's not. Overall, it's not worth the film it's recorded on."
5,Fabric Kit,"This stuff is amazing. It does exactly what it says and is easy to use. Color match is up to you, but I did a great job with it. Highly recommend it. I tore a hole in my seat by accident and this fixed it."
2,A tough read.,"Meandering narrative which jumps around all over the place and has no real compelling flow. Irritating to read. ""The Devil in Dover"" by Lauri Lebo is much better."
3,A disturbing book,The Hot Zone is not of consistent high quality from cover to cover or from chapter to chapter but there are enough effectively terrifying accounts in the book to keep you turning the pages.
4,"Great, until the very end.","This book was terrific almost all the way through --- exciting, interesting, suspenseful and informative. Then, in the last chapter or so, the author started inserting his pseudo-scientific/philosophical theories about nature and ecology. Aside from the fact that they make no sense and are logically flawed, they just do not belong in the book and stick out like a sore thumb after the straightforward, documentary approach of the rest of the book. Worth reading, but skip the last chapter."
2,Lousy writing,"Not a bad book- the subject matter is innately fascinating, but Preston's writing is so poor that I was constantly distracted. In his attempt to be ""novelistic"" (is that a word?) he loads his scenes with imagined details- what a victim was thinking for example. He is fond of repeating himself ad nauseum, expecially with oh so clever metaphors like ""It was a slate wiper, a population thinner, etc.""The single worst line in the book sounds like an intentional joke. ""They wanted to do experiments on Ebola, but they didn't want ebola to do experiments on them."" If you can explain what that line means, please let me know."
2,How much is too much,"The Hot Zone by Richard Preston i can not say was a favotite. The extreme amount of details detracted from the novel itslef. I like the imagery, but it was so much that i was distracted from the story line itself. Also the constant jumping around from place to place and person to person caused a great deal of confusion. It was an intresting concept, but it was not written as well as it could have been. Overall I did like the book and would suggest it to others, but i suggest that the readers should read it twice in order to have a full understanding of the book."
5,An excelent book of virus,It is great how Preston write this true story and how the people of it explain to him what was happening. It is a very interesting book.
4,The book shows how fragile the ecosystem is with primates.,The author thoroughly and accurately reseached the subject matter. The book was interesting and at times compelling with suspense regarding the Ebola virus.
2,An Okay Disappointment. . .,"The book had an interesting subject matter, but I was disappointed otherwise. Preston uses improper punctuation quite often and constantly refers to the reader as ""you,"" which ticked me off considerably.He also did not talk very much about the science in the book and seemed to want to dramatize everything rather than gave the reader detailed information. As other reviewers have also stated, the book does read a lot like a grade school book.Read it if you're bored, but otherwise, well, read Andromeda Strain or something else."
3,"Poor science, but a good page-turner.","Preston knows how to write, and he does so in a style that keeps you into the story and makes you feel for the characters. With that, he's got the makings of an excellent work of fiction. But since the book is non-fiction, he ought to get some facts straight. First, Ebola causes hemorragic fever. This is to say that vessels of the bloodstream leak resulting in loss of blood and body fluids. The internal organs do NOT melt! A survivor of the infection will thus recover just as quickly as he became ill. For more info, read the tale as told by someone who has seen Ebola face to face, such as Joseph McCormick or C.J. Peters"
2,Don't Be Fooled By Those Enticing Reviews,"Don't wast you time, money, or effort in reading this ""book"". I unfortunatley had to read this monster of a book for english, but if I didn't have to I would have put it down after the first chapter. Don't be fooled by the enticing reviews, cause you'll be sorry. Remember, I warned y-o-u!!"
4,The Hot Zone,"Book was in very good shape.Received before I was suppose to & it was Christmas time, so this let me know this company cares about it's customers."
1,Easily the worst book I have ever read.,"I have never read such mindless drivel. If anyone has ever actually read this, they know that it is all gore with little depth. I could not relate at all to any of the characters. There were a few areas of suspense, but the entire lack of a climax was enough to turn me off. Which brings me to the worst part of this book. The ending is the most uninterseting, suspensless, and useless I have ever read. Avoid this book like the ebola"
2,I don't understand why so many people love this book.,"I really don't. Preston's style is rather tedious and doesn't do justice to a fascinating topic. I do like how his images all give the reader a sense of doom; it seems that one could catch Ebola from anything in Africa. However, it does not make up for Preston's boring style."
4,Too Hot To Handle,"Being force to read this in my English class I must say was not my teacher's best choice. I base this only on the fact that there was more in-detail gore than your average horror film, but reflecting back on Hot Zone I know understand that the extreme details were there because this is the cold hard fact. People have died from these natural events and will still die in the furture. Even if the human species considers gaining control we will soon have to relize we can't gain control of the uncontrolable. I enjoyed the cold hard fact about this book, that the ""Hot Zone,"" even outside of a book, is still too hot to handle for the human race."
5,Facinatingly Horrifying,"I started this book at the suggestion from my mother, and soon after, I finished it. Before I read this book, Ebola was just another disease that I always seemed to confuse with E. coli, but now, I will never mistake one for the other again. This was a haunting true story that has stuck with me. I have recommended this book to many of my friends, and I also recommend it to you."
5,Heart Chakra Meditations,I have found this cd to have good basic meditation breathing instruction with the profound focus on the heart beat.The Bee Bhramari Breathing Technique is beautiful and restful. I can see where it would be very healing. The guided meditation is very relaxing and deeply significant. The 2nd CD has beautiful music and pulse to practice to.
4,Gorgeous looking but...,"I bought this in Jan. 2007 and it has served me well, in fact it looks as good now sitting on the stove as it did when I first bought it. Today however when I was washing it I discovered there is rust inside the spout. Don't know how long it has been rusting since I don't usually LOOK into the spout but inspected the whole kettle today for some reason. I have not dropped the kettle or used any hard abrasives nor has anything been inside it but filtered water. It could have had a crack in the porcelain from the beginning.I still like the looks of this kettle, it heats just fine and the whistle is great, but since I have to replace it because it it rusting I've ordered a clear glass kettle from Germany from Amazon for around $11 and it's dishwasher safe."
4,better than photographs,"This is an excellent guide for beginners. It makes no pretense at completeness. The drawings focus on the distinctive characteristics of the subject mushrooms. unlike photos, which give equal weight to features which do and which do not distinguish one from another. ALWAYS HEED THE FIRST RULE OF MUSHROOM FORAGING -- WHEN IN DOUBT, DON'T."
3,very very slow,"I recently wrote that my experience has been the worst I have had on Amazon in not receiving the merchantice. Now, I have received the items in perfect condition over 4 weeks delayed with an apology note in the package."
1,Doesn't fit,"I have the green Optima lightweight vac. Love it too but hate cleaning the dustcup/filter. I will try the nylon covering tip that someone mentioned. My vac came with the DCF-10 (grey). When I just went to put the DCF-14 Hepa filter in it, I can't close the dust cup screw top either."
2,DCF-10 IS MUCH BETTER,THE DCF-10 WORKS MUCH BETTER THAN THIS ONE...I HAD TO REPLACE IT WITH LESS THEN 5 MONTHS USING IT. JUST BUY THE DCF10 INSTEAD OF THIS.
4,Well......,"I am ten years old just like the other ten-year-old reviewer. I think I will have to disagree. Abbott and Costello areNOT the stars that is true. But the show is funny-funnier that some others thatI have seen. You might like it, but as my dad says I'm not making you any promises."
1,manufacturing defects,"I bought two of these headphones. Both had serious manufacturing defects.On one, the supplied RCA cord was bad (no sound at all). I replaced this with one from my junk box and all was well.The other had to be returned. (Aside, one reason I buy from Amazon is their excellent return polices). There simply was no sound to the left earpiece.While a population of two, of course, is insufficient to make a lasting judgement, it does seem the factory fails the soldering/crimping test. :)The purpose of these was simply to allow my wife to watch/listen to TV in the middle of the night without awaking me. (one for the small bedroom TV and the other for the monster in the living room). Hence the absence of comments on sound quality.. except to set them up (or try to), I have never had them on."
4,"maybe not the best, however...","Maybe not the best quality compared to expensive wired headphones, however I find them very comfortable, andI have discovered that the quality depends on placement of the unit. as it turns out we use it mostly for my kid who likes to sleep with music while the other doesn't and, the wired ones tend to wrap around their neck, so I have given them to the kid.only problem is that at the base the plug in for mp3 players and such is not working the best now and has to be fiddled with in order to work. otherwise, I love them. and the price is under $75.00"
5,How do you hook this up?,I thought I had it but it must have been a pause on the TV - I am a hands onn person and don't read maps!Help!
2,Totally Unreliable Battery,"These headphones are pretty good when they work, both quality and range. But unless you use them daily, you absolutely cannot rely on the rechargeable battery. If you use the headphones at exactly the moment a recharge is complete, it will work fine. But if you have not used them for several days, but left the headphones in the cradle (supposedly to recharge as needed), they will NOT continuously recharge. In fact, they will almost always be dead. Not a very good design. I have many Sony devices with rechargeable batteries that never lose a charge until the battery gets old (my wireless phone and my rechargeable universal remote control). But this Sony item seems to have missed that design session. Avoid these like the plague."
1,a good idea,The product is a good idea. The unit I received did not work as advertised and was returned. The return process worked well.
2,Doesn't work for me.,"I was never able to get this to work successfully on my system. I have to hook it into my Marentz receiver. It worked for one night, not very success, and then nothing. I sent it back for repair and it was returned saying that nothing was wrong. Perhaps it's pilot error, but it's strange that even the battery doesn't seem to charge successfully. I had great hopes for it. Maybe with a less sophisticated system."
1,Not working,The product had to be returned. The right headphone was inoperable. I purchased a JVC setup that I am completely satisified with.
5,TV headphones,These are excellent. They take out the background diffusion. I have enjoyed the TV now that I have them.Would reccomend them for anyone who is hearing impaired.
2,Great for a while...,"These headphones lived up to all my expectations, but then after a few months the left side stopped working. It's not great to listen to music from the right side only."
2,does not autopower on. cuts off frequently,does not auto on you have to plg-unplug the power cord to get it to power up. thay cut off with out warning.
4,Good if you sit still while listening...they squeak when you move,"These headphones make plastic squeaks when you move your head around. It is acceptable for me because I use them to sit still and watch TV after my kids go to bed. If you want to walk around and listen, they squeak too much.These have better sound, battery life and volume adjustment than an pair of Radio Shack wireless headphones I had before. Almost no base tones.I bought these because there is nothing to plug in or turn on/off with these headphones. We'll see if this fixes the ""dead battery because spouse didn't plug in the charger"" problem. The headphones need to be seated firmly in the cradle for the induction charge system to start working. Anyway, decent wireless headphones for a decent price."
1,Added Problems,"I don't think the unit shipped to me was new. The battery was installed and the orginal packageing had been opened. The tuning button is missing, so the headset can not be tuned. Headset has been returned to Sony for warranty repair and is not expected back for two weeks."
1,Terrible,"Worst wireless headphones I've ever used. I only used them about 4-5 times and gave up on them. The Seller via Amazon arranged an exchange with Sony. The new ones received were just as bad. Load noises, hissing sounds while using. I recommend completely avoiding these."
1,Waste of time,"If you want quality sound with NO STATIC or random outages, this product is NOT for you. I wanted these headphones for being able to walk around the house, i could not get three feet away from the transmitter without losing the signal or hearing static throughout. I have another pair of wireless headphones that I can walk out of my house, into my basement and they never have given me a mere tweek. I am a techie, I did my research, I followed the instructions and I must say, the words sound and quality cannot be used in the same phrase to describe this product. There was none. I have a pair of Rocketfish, and though the sales guys don't push that product, you will be MORE than happy if you get it. Same concept, best range i have found, good sound quality.don't waste your time. Too much of a hassle to find a good signal."
1,dont trust other reviews,"i was like, ohh some of the review were good. lets just try this since half are good. then i found the signal sucked and kept turning off. do not get this unless you want to waste money"
2,Not what a expected,Most of the time there is not even playing music. I cant believe I spent 80$! I will advise go for another product
1,"Bass = Static, these suck","I have tried putting them far far away from my TV, in case something was messing with the signal. There is static for all things bass. 5' away from base, static; 15 ft away from bass.Maybe it was something in my livingroom?Wrong, outside in the garage plugged into a radio. Static.Slow to chargeAwful sound qualityPure crap. I wish my wife wouldnt have bought me these. Now i cant buy myself ones that will work because it was an Xmas present i took 1-2 months to try :("
2,Clicks Then Cuts Off,"This is my 4th set of Sony headphones. I thoroughly researched customer reviews on several brands before I bought these from Amazon. I got them 2 days ago and hooked them up to my 73 inch Mitsubishi HDTV through my Denon receiver. It took a while to tune them. Now whether I mute the sound or turn the sound down on the receiver I get a click and then the sound cuts off for 2 or more seconds. I don't mind the click but I do mind the cutoff. I could lose important dialogue. My primary use of headphones is for TV viewing. Did I do some thing wrong in the hookup? I notice that when I change the channel on the headphones the sound still comes through even if I do not change the channel on the transmitter. Does this mean the tuner is not really working? I don't know. If I cant fix this problem, these are going back."
5,sony wireless headphones,it was everything the description said--works perfectly- we are both able to hear everything on our tv-i recomend it highly
2,No Bass at All - Regret Buying Them,"I was sorely disappointed with these. I was hoping for a set of headphones that would allow me to watch movies late at night when my family is sleeping. I had a regular pair of headphones that worked really well but I saw these wireless ones and thought it would be very cool to not have to deal with wires. That part was cool. What was not cool was how lame the sound was. Every explosion or bang or loud clang in the movie sounded distorted and fuzzy. No bass at all. Really lame. Sony used to be the best. Not any more, apparently......"
1,Sony MDRRF970RK 900 MHz Analog RF Wireless Headphone,"After charging 16 Hrs, (red light out and battery fully charged) and removing headset from cradle the transmitter failed to transmit. The remedy I found was I'd have to unplug the power supply for two minutes re-plug it in and then it would work. Thank God for Amazon. No problem in returning them. I am now going to order a pair RS120 926 MHz Wireless RF Headphones with Charging Cradle."
4,Very happy!,"I purchased this product a few years back and had all sorts of problems and returned it.I happen to buy this product recently (not realizing I had returned it previously).To my surprise, it woks great and I am very pleased with the quality of the reception.I recommend this to anyone that is looking for a good headphones that is wireless!I felt I should correct my previous opinion. At time depending on where you use, it may not work, but hard to tell without trying."
3,Poor workmanship,"I have this unit for over a year. There are several problems with it. It's not built to last. First the left cover broke off, now a poor contact somewhere does not switch on the unit on many occasions. Need to pull the inner band by hand several times. Also it suddenly stops working occasionally for no apparent reason. My hearing is poor, I got it for TV watching. Especially the movies where so much external 'real life' surrounding sounds make it difficult to make out the spoken word. No complaints about the sound. Just poorly made. I would give it 3 stars at most."
2,"Average Sound, Poor Fit for Small Head","Wireless headphones sounded like a great idea to me as I have always had to use an extension cord for the headphones on my stereo. My last two pairs have been from Sony, so I thought I'd try these for free from a rewards program. Everything set up fine, but the audio quality was poorer than my old, cheaper wired pair. The volume was weak with little bass -- any high volume (either on the stereo or earpiece) resulted in distortion. It could be my small head, but the earpieces wouldn't make a snug fit -- not noise-cancelling in any way."
5,Sony MDRRF970RK Wireless Headphone,These are the greatest headphones. I bought them for my husband and now he can hear the TV and I don't have to listen to his programs. He said he doesn't miss a word now. I love them too.
5,Comfortable with Clear Sound,"No complaints! I use it almost every night. Comfortable to wear for an hour or 2. Clear sound, no static."
2,Not very comfortable,"This is the second set of these headphones we've purchased, the first one being a few years ago. Our first one seemed better quality and more comfortable, and we liked it enough to buy a second pair. But now it seems cheaper made. The plastic is lighter, the ear cups are smaller, the sound is lower quality, and it just feels cheap."
1,"Hissing, buzzing, crackling.....disappointing","Not sure if the people giving this set a good review have any idea of what good headphone sound is. I have cheap $20 headphones that hiss less and have the same sound quality, better bass and are just as comfortable. On top of that, the bass in songs is completely lost on these. DO NOT BUY IF YOU HATE HISSING AND HEADPHONES THAT TURN BASS INTO CRACKLING CRAP SOUNDS. These suckers are going back.I had pair of Sony wireless headphones 10 years ago that absolutely destroyed these new ones for less money. Sony has obviously decided to use cheaper parts."
3,It feels like $40 to $50,I bought this at a reduced price here in amazon in the $60ish price range as a gift for my wife. It's not that bad like what the other reviewers are claiming. A little interference here and there but not that horrible and still working for me afer 3 months. It feels like a $100ish product when I am holding it but works like a $40-$50ish. I am okay with it because I got what I paid for :) and that is all that matters
1,Excellent sound but failed in two days,"I'm hard of hearing and even with hearing aids I can only watch TV programs with closed captions. Music is a real problem - either I turn it up which annoys our condo neighbors or I'm tied to hard-wired headphones. I was really looking forward to going wireless.The first step was to charge the batteries for 16 hours. Once that was done the headphones worked beautifully - excellent sound and comfortable to wear. But, after maybe six or seven hours of usage over two days, they quit. OK back on the charger for another sixteen hours. Zero. Zip. Nada. Niente. Nothing. Stone cold dead. So I sent them back. The refund came through OK but needless to say a very frustrating experience."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!,"We purchased this as a Christmas present and they don't work!! I purchased as ""new"" and they don't work at all.....very disappointed."
1,hearing lost,My Sony wireless headphones are a big disppointment. I am trying a 2nd set that Sony customer service sent me and still can't hear a thing after the first use of each set. I know it's hooked up properly and totally charged because the first time I used it was great! Subsequent trys proved futile and will be returneing for a refund. We love our Sony TV and DVD player but the headphones are a bust.
4,Great Sound!,"These are everything I expected from Sony... The are comfortable and fit nicely over the ears, well, my ears anyway... The sound quality is great! HI and lows are crisp and clean. They do have a proprietary battery set but can also take standard batteries as well (although they do not charge in the dock).. I enjoy these enough to consider another set. Once again Sony did not disappoint me!"
2,not easy,i sure hope we can figure out an easier way to use this product. i bought for my husband (me really so i can enjoy quiet again). It doesn't hook up to our Sony Bravia tv... guess we'll have to call but there isn't a hole for the plug... audio out. BIG problem and not addressed in directions.considering returning headphones.
2,Great fit but too much noise!!,"I discovered after getting these headphones on that the plastic cups make noise every single time I move my head. This is very bothersome esp. when watching a movie with lots of dialog. Also I have noticed a lot of hissing in these headphones, even when the base is within arm's length of the headphones, still lots of noise. As I write this review I am listening to music on my computer and I still head hiss sounds and static. This is ridiculous, I do not want to hear hissing in the background of my favorite songs, very very disturbing.I would recommend looking at different brands when buying wireless headphones, because clearly Sony needs to improve theirs."
1,The worst Christmas CD out there!,"I thought I'd heard everything, but WOW is absolutely the worst Christmas CD out there. Kathy Mattea's inspired ""Mary Did You Know?"" was my reason for buying, but it's the only track worth a listen. Every other song is a weird pop/jazz/soul arrangement most listeners would find jarring, cacophonous and irreverent. Don't waste your money."
2,Not the way to keep your focus on the reason for the season,"This CD is alright. The first disc is so much better that the second. The second disc is all about christian rock bands trying to make the season ""cool"", but ends up sounding as if these bands don't care for the season (or the reason for the season)at all. Save your hard earned money or spend it on some of the CDs from the artists highlighted on the first disc."
2,"A few gems, but disappointing overall","There are a few standout tracks here -- ""This Christmas,"" a rap tune, turned out to be my favorite, somewhat to my surprise -- but most of this compilation is forgettable. Some are so overproduced and over-arranged that they're almost impossible to listen to. Not a good investment."
1,50 Amp Motor Guide Circuit Breaker MM5870,"Since the wire gauge is 6 going from the trolling motor to the batteries, I find theterminals on the breaker way too small to connect the ring lugs to it without thelugs shorting to each other and therefore, circumventing the breaker. This breakeris not made for this application....would work for way smaller gauge wiring or cable."
4,educational,This is an excellent book that gives very insiteful information on known and unknown practices in professional sports.
1,Reverse Racism,"I have issues with racism in any form but I find it equally as offensive when books like this come out which try and make a race out to be victims.In a nutshell, if someone is complaining that they are being taken advantage of and still being paid 40 million, or even 1 million, one has to ask themselves, ""Is this guy for real? How stupid does he think we are?""I place the authors intentions of writing as fair and just, but somewhere along the line he corrupted the concept into something grotesque, offensive, and just plain wrong. I could have read and Ann Coulter book and been less offended by the implications."
4,Honey Smacks are good but not fantastic,"Smacks, which apparently only have 100 calories per serving have a classic taste which will have you wanting more. It is fairly simplistic whith basic grains and pure sweetness. However, the honey glazing dissolves into milk after about 2 minutes. This takes away from it's flavor and crunchiness which leaves many with some dissapointment. Although it could be refined, honey smacks is a one of a kind cereal which will never fade despite it's name changes."
2,So-so,I love chick-lit and this book was just average. It took me a really long time to read because it was a book I could easily put down.
5,Aussome CD!,"Keith Urban's ""Golden Road"" is one of the best investments I have made this year. After seeing Keith perform live on Kenny Chesney's tour, I went out, bought his CD, and now can't stop listening to it. Every song on there has a unique sound to it and they are all very catchy. You'll get addicted once you listen to it once. It's an incredible album and Keith's talent shines through as he wrote/co-wrote almost every song on it and plays a numerous amount of instruments in every song. His voice is captivating and so are his eyes! A must have for any music fan!"
5,I love it!!!!!!!,"Keith Urban's vocal talent really shows!! Although I love his other albums, I like this one the best. There's only one song I don't listen to unless I'm in the mood for silly, non-needed songs, and that's ""Blue Jeans."" My favorites on this album are ""Whenever I Run,"" ""Somebody Like You,"" ""You Look Good in My Shirt,"" (Just because the way he sings it is cool sounding, either than that it's a weird song) and ""Song For Dad."" My friend informed me that at the end of the last song, ""You're Not My God,"" if you fast-forward through the end, (or if you have a CD player that tells you how long the song is,) you'll find a hidden track called ""One Cord Song."" (It starts at 6:19.) I think this song is really funny. It has some meaning to it, and you should try to interpret it for yourself, but either than that it's funny, and you should sing along! I love this album and recommend it definately!! GO KETIH!!"
5,One Of A Kind,"I truely believe that ""Golden Road"" is one of a kind, and so is Keith Urban. I have to say that there is not even one song that I don't like. That doesn't happen often. I enjoy hearing songs that you can say, ""Hey! I'm not the only person who feels that way"". All of the songs are obviously ""real"", and you can tell by the voice that he sings them in that each song has it's own story. The emotions are so great in each song. This CD has to be my favorite of all time, and I think that Keith Urban is absolutely unblievable!!!"
5,It's GOLDEN!!!,"This is one of those CDs I can put in my car player, my computer, or my big system in the livingroom and listen to ALL DAY! It's got something for every mood, and everyone should own it! ""You'll Think of Me"" is the perfect song to crank up and sing at the top of your lungs when you're feeling down. ""Song for my Dad"" is so true, no matter what your age is. And ""Who Wouldn't Wanna be Me"" is so much fun to dance to."
1,WHAT?,"This man sucks. He has no soul. Where is the Texas Twang. Great Country will die with Merle haggard, George Jones, and Waylon Jennings. How the hell do country fans plan to stay straight with this crap"
4,If It Ain't Broke.....,"Keith stays real close to the formula from his last album on ""Golden Road"".It is slightly better than that album,however.The main reason are this batch of songs are a little more deep and reflective(but not overly so).Another great achievement for Urban."
5,A Must Have!,"If you are a history buff or a Shay Locomotive lover of any kind, this book is a must have! Great photographs, and plenty of them, combined with lots of facts and a great narrative makes this book an essential West Virginia logging experience. Get is while you can!"
3,READ READ READ!,"All I have to say is READ CAREFULLY.I thought I was getting 3 boxes of this stuff, and after going back and re-reading, it was only 1.3x the price of what I usually buy isn't worth it.They need to 'chill out' and lower the price.This was the most expensive coffee I ever bought (by mistake or on purpose).I couldn't tell the difference between this and the cheap stuff."
3,Easy to read story,"I liked this book. It went through the story at a good pace, good characters, good details. Worth reading at any age."
5,Definitely a five star read!,"I haven't read a Regency romance in years (I am over 50) but after seeing the Hamish Macbeth series on DVD decided to read something by Marion Chesney (alias M. C. Beaton). I dislike the ""soft porn"" so many of today's authors use to sell romance type stories. This is a ""clean romance"" - fun and funny, drama and hilarious escapades. This series of six stories is a riot. Emily of Exeter starts by giving the background of Hannah Pym - now a gentle woman of independent means. The stories are well woven and can be read separately or as a series which is how I did it. Hannah is a woman after my own heart. I could relate to her and how she handled the situations in which she found herself. Enjoy! These are for reading and re-reading in a few years, much like ""Anne of Green Gables"". Years ago I enjoyed Georgette Heyer romances and find I like this series even better."
3,Review,This was purchased as a gift for a serious Pink Floyd fan...but he was extremely thrilled when he saw it in the box.
5,A great look inside of of Pink Floyd's Best albums,This documentary is great look inside one of Pink Floyds best albums.If you are a fan of the album get this documentary.
1,Infuriating,"I will offer a personal guarantee on this one: criminal. Ever tried to shoot a fox or rabbit with a shotgun from 45 yards? How about while it's running? How about while being attacked by a bobcat? How much fun does it sound if all the animals gather behind the lodge and you can't fire within 50 meters of the building? What if you need a scope or water & food for longer endurance and you have no money left to buy them from the ""store?"" This game is slow, incompetent and an insult to the great graphic on the cover. That's the game that Cabela's is playing: lure us in with overly-dramatic cover art and then just as we spend an hour lining up an impossible shot at a barely-visable target...attack us with a mad-animal engine. It's sooooooo fulfilling. Adding further injury, the game is filled with dozens of banners that encourage the gamer to buy Cabela's products. Hmmmm."
3,Entertaining for a plane ride,Downloaded this to watch as one of three movies on a cross-country plane ride. It was entertaining and kept my interest.
2,poor delivery,"arrived a day late, a little smashed up but fixable, had to call around and expedite delivery."
1,Blonde Expressions,"Although the product might be okay, it was not what I ordered or what was pictured on your site. I was sent via email a postage paid label to return the product and did receive a full refund and apology."
2,Misleading editorial review,"The amazon review of this as stated is misleading. Stating that the content is with history and, well, the overall review is contrary to what is in the DVD set. It appears that a Small Mom and Pop type of company produced it in a manner where quality was not the top priority. The content is mostly from a spectator view. Almost as if the footage was compiled from tourists footage.VERY little historical or tech data. Simple interisting tech data. The sound is poor. Voice dubbing is misaligned on one of the segmants. The transition from chapters is abrubt and it skips. Regarding the trains, 90 percent of the trains in the content are small Shay and Cg type trains. Only 2 segments have 'real' steam locomotives that the layman would recognise.The speacial features are very short and some of it is renditions of the chapter content of the main feature.This set is by any definition inadequate for the price and quality of content and material advertised."
1,What the Heck?!?!,"It's pretty clear that Warner Bros. is trying to just capitalize on the kiddie market with the treatment of the animated series of Batman. It's too bad, a lot of the series' fans were teens, young adults and older who now would love to have the whole series on DVD. I have several dozen of the old episodes on VHS, commercials and all. It's too bad I don't even have a VCR anymore! I'd like to catch up on one of animation's triumphs of style and substance, but I won't waste money on what's being offered. It never fails to amaze me how they will try to get moms to pick up a Batman movie for their kids rather than please the original fans of the series. WB take note - the fans of the series who used to watch it on TV now have jobs and money to spend on boxed sets."
3,its good but not really,"this is basically just 4 episodes from the Animated series, if you added $10 more dollars from the used version you could get a full volume dvdthey only thing that it is good for is just to improve your batman collection, just to look good on your self that is it"
1,Waste of Money,"DO NOT BUY THIS! It is a complete waste.The WB continues to prove what cheapskates they are by releasing just a few episodes with little to no features.If this is the best they have to offer, then I'm not buying."
2,Season sets vs. Single discs?,"The fact is Batman TAS did not have normal TV seasons. I think the first was 65 episodes. Way too many for a box set. And later seasons only amount to some thing like 20, 10 and 5. Releasing them one disc at a time is not the way to go either. The best way would to divide the first 65 into two voulmes, or something. The reason some of these first episodes on this disc are not the best is they are in order, so before the show got really good. I most likely will NOT get these, same as the first disc. It is just not worth the price. It has been a long time since I saw the show, but I would rather wait for the slim chance Warner Bros. will grow a brain!"
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,The episodes in this disc are definitely not one of the best this series had to offer and it appears real fans of this show will have to wait several years before we can actually purchase better episodes on DVD (as many great episodes were released after 1994).
2,Incredible series - another disappointing DVD,"""Batman:The Animated Series"" is literally everything I could want from a comic book adaptation. In fact, I would say it remains the best comic book inspired TV series or movie ever made. It stays true to the characters, tells interesting stories and has some of the finest animation around. A truly groundbreaking, amazing series.Which is why it is all the more disappointing to see ""Batman:TAS"" get such a lackluster DVD release. Like all TV shows, it should have been released in Season Box Sets rather than in this manner. Even as it is, the extras are slim to none, and there is nothing to really recommend this DVD. I hope Warner Bros will correct this error, and give us some Season Box Sets. Until then, I will decline."
2,dissatisfied,The product was difficlt to use in small area on the side of seats due to hot sealer. It looked ok for about 2 weeks then it cracked and peeled. I would not recommend this product.
3,repair kit,"the repair of the cracked plastic or naugahyde seat appeared to work, but the appearance of the repair did not come out as in the sample picture that came with the product."
2,leather repair,This product is way to difficult for the lay person. To much to the process of the repairing of leather or vinyl
4,Classic Sarah,"I too have been a fan of Sarah's since her first record. I've had the pleasure of hearing her in concert (once at a home concert with about 60 other people...what a treat that was), several times over the past 20 years. It's good to have her back creating music for adults. She's created a great body of work over the past 20 years, is a talented song writer and special human being."
3,"Not a ""five star"" book....","This is NOT a ""five star"" book. This title was printed in 2000...and pretty much just a re-hash of Carbohydrates Addict Diet and Dr. Atkins books. I was hoping for something a little more original."
1,What's next after now,"Actually 0 starsExpected more from this book. It feels forced, has the feel of 'publish or perish'. The put-down of the power of now (mentioning people were making great amounts of money with it) smacked of jealousy; using a word such as 'next' which suggests space and/or time and allegedly follows 'now' is tortured. Clever, of course, but not intelligent. The author appears to grasp at straws (or some newly invented concept) to engage the interest of prospective readers: what can possibly happen after now? Other than more now. I just did not want to jump down that rabbit hole! And calling non-duality dual? Perchance desperate for ideas? His other book ""Being One"" had some rather intelligent insights.The writing style in this book is convoluted, the content irritating - promises much, delivers little more than annoyance.Usually not interested in reviewing books - but felt someone had to."
3,Good refill but not universal,"Purchased this for a our Acura but it is not universal. It did not fit the narrow blade frame that we needed. I love the Anco refills and the cost value is outstanding so I will give these to someone else or cut them down to fit into something. If you have an Acura, you likely need the narrow version."
3,Ron Contour?,"I'm not sure what exactly makes this disc the return of Ron Contour.....it seemingly has no connection to the original R.C. album. But whatever....regardless, this is a departure from the norm as Moka did not take care of his own production here. I'm a big fan and really enjoy his work but on occasion it's cool to hear his rhymes in the context of someone else's production. That said, the production here doesn't blow me away. It's decent but there really isn't much depth to the mix.....so the end result is a collection of nice beats and enjoyable melodies with some nice Moka flows on top. Cold Outside is a really cool track borrowing it's title from an earlier Moka and Ishkan song. Anyway, if you're a fan you probably already have this....if you're new to the man start with Flood or Lime Green."
2,Nice while it lasted,"Worked great without any problems for about 11 months, then it died. This was with very little usage. Used only for my HTPC. Wasn't abused, never dropped. This company makes a very good Media Center remote, but I would look elsewhere for a keyboard."
4,Give them time,"When I first got the sheets I was really disappointed. They were rough and scratchy and hard to sleep on. After a month or so of sleeping on and multiple washings, they are now really soft and so comfortable. If you can handle the first month, they will definitly be worth purchasing."
3,Purchased for aunt and she is not impressed :(,"I purchased these for my aunt who wanted a high thread count sheet set for Christmas. Based on the reviews I thought this was an awesome deal. My aunt is not happy with them and said that they don't feel like a high thread count sheet. She said they are very shiny, too satin-like. Personally, I would think that is a good thing, but she has had 500+ tc sheets before and she said sateen doesn't mean satin. This is because there is either low quality cotton used or a fake sheen added to the fiber. Guess the price was too good to be true."
3,A good buy,"Compared to the 400-Thread-Count Egyptian Cotton Sateen Queen Sheet Set I bought here, this is definitely a good buy at the same price. The sheets wrinkle a little but the touches and feeling of quality is very decent for this price."
3,Dont get the dark ones,Too dark and my husband has problems keeping water out of them. My clear women's ones work great.
1,Gold Speedo's,"Used goggles a few times in salt water ocean pool. Anti-fog coating started delaminating from inside of goggles, now unable to use. Very dissapointed."
3,Some fogging issues,"These goggles form a tight seal to prevent water from entering the goggles. It also comes with 3 nose bridge sizes to customize the distance between the left and right eyes. Some problems with fogging after adjusting the size becuase it was too tight. Can't tell if a proper seal is no longer forming or what could be leading to the fogging because it initially was not an issue. However, overall good value and good product."
2,for the scientist,This is an okay series. Now let me qualify that statement. If you want to know about the mind set and overall life of a these animals you will get that but if you wanted to see more animals images with less people this is not for you. I have bought this with the hopes that my 2 year old who loves all animals would enjoy. But I could not even enjoy it with all the camera shots of scientists and researchers talking about the animals and what they descovered that I was wondering were the animals were. I wanted to learn about the animals while watching the animals not while watching people.
4,Travel Sickness pills,I have been using the Rugby brand of travel sickness pills now for over ten years. My daughter who is a nurse introduced me to them way back when. I have recommended them to many others who have not been successful in finding a good travel pill. I don't know what I would do without them. Just got back from another 7 day cruise with no worries about being queasy!
1,a rushed home job,"The lack of someone lurking behind Prince's shoulder while in the recording studio and having the courage to tell him when he produces second rate nonsense has been missing since the departure of the Fargnoli management team. This is a poor track incorporating biblical references that have little relevance or sense of genuine compassion to the katrina disaster. Musically the lack of emotion conveyed by the unnecessarily complicated chord changes and irrelevant reference to Sade also make the feel of this track disjointed. While Prince fans will generally hype this track, the reality is that ""4 the tears in your eyes"" this isn't and to add a charity track with an instrumental showing off your musical skills is just pure self indulgence and frankly crass. Lets hope this is not an indication of the upcoming 3121."
5,#1 Latin/Rock Album of the Year!,"This is an absolutely wonderful album. I cry everytime I hear it. My favorite song is Best I Can because it is about Selena, Chris's deceased wife. This album definately gets my vote for #1 Latin/Rock album of the year!!!!"
4,A deeply felt catharsis,"This is obviously a real catharsis for Chris Perez, who is better known (at the moment) as the widower of Selena Quintanilla-Perez. A number of the tracks are relatively thinly veiled allusions to the pain he's had to work through for the last several years.It's not all tears-and-suffering -- a number of the songs are upbeat, and this is a group that could really put its stamp on Spanish-language rock. The first track doesn't waste any time, it just rocks. Most are relatively quiet and introspective, but don't be fooled into thinking this is in any way some sort of overly-sensitive light rock. The disc as a whole is definitely a real emotional outlet for Mr. Perez, and a varied one.And really, that's what music is for anyway.(One note: you'll get much more out of the disc if you're bilingual, though it will be enjoyable even if you're not.)"
2,"Nice trimmer, bad battery","Got this trimmer as a gift for New Year and was quite happy. I had Philips trimmer before and this Remington is much better in everything - from blades to overall feeling.But after couple of weeks of use, battery died. The trimmer now works about 3 to 5 minutes after full charge, so the only way to use it is to plug it in."
5,A Unique Album - A 5 Star Recording,"This is simply one of the most enjoyable albums I have ever heard. I was about to go on a drive with a friend (we both were professional opera stage directors). I said I was feeling a little sad at the time. He brought this album to cheer me up. Boy, did it ever! I fell in love with it immediately, and I completly forgot whatever it was that was getting me down.The songs, the singing, and the musicianship are magnificent. Buy this, and live happy forever after! <G>"
3,"sexy, lovely","Courtesy of A Romance ReviewJenny, the third book in the Brides of Durango series, is another page turner of storyteller Bobbi Smith. The plot is smooth and packed with sexy cowboys, lovely ladies and magnificent scenery. Ms. Smith has created two courageous and daring women (Jenny and Rose) who know and go after what they want. Not only Jenny who gains Cole back but also Rose who finds her true love with a happy-ever-after ending to the story. Fans of Wild West romance must not miss the other two earlier books in the series - Elise and Tessa which feature the other two brides of Durango."
4,Great fastener bag,"Best parachute bag I've found. The sides are taller than the pockets, so it locks everything down when the drawstring is pulled tight. The bag is made of surprisingly durable material, has a high capacity, and is easy to transport without spilling."
4,Wonderful Recording and Beautiful Music,Just discoered J Blunt late last year and am a fan now. Love his expressive and wiggly voice that caught my attention in the first place especially with his ballads. Looking forward to the second album.
5,Feelin' the love,"Truth be told, I hadn't really known James's work before I saw this show, just a couple of singles. So, for me, it was the first time I had the chance to really see what his music was all about.I immediately connected with his sound, and the powerfully moving lyrics of his songs. I admire an artist that really seems to be involved with the songs and the performances. Blunt really seems to give the best of himself every single time, I came to realize.And then, I became a fan. Bought both deluxe editions of his albums 'Back to Bedlam' and 'All the Lost Souls', and keep listening to them on my MP4 player quite often.Looking forward to going to his concert with Elton John here in Rio de Janeiro!Highly recommended."
4,Something Real,Great CD. Dia Frampton from The Voice and her sister Meg. Amazing vocals and talent from both of these girls. Hope to hear more from them.
3,another funkadelic compilation with the same songs,there are so many copilations with the same funkadelic songs it's ridiculous giving it 3 stars cause I'm a serious funkadelic fanatic.
5,Excellent!! I loved it!!,"At last!! I've been waiting a long time for Motown to re-release this CD. I've played my old album so much that it is very scratchy and it skips in spots. This remastered version on CD sounds great. Since fans will never have the opportunity to hear the ""Classic Five"" sing again, this is the next best thing to being present at a live performance. The enthusiasm of the audience is apparent and it brings back memories of Temptations concerts of long ago. Paul's lead on ""Don't Look Back"" is fantastic and it makes one wonder why he wasn't used more often to lead. At any rate, I recommend this CD for anyone who is truly a fan of the Temptations. Now if only Motown would re-release videos on my favorite group, I would be ecstatic. I know one was done entitled ""The Tempts and the Tops"" but it is currently out of print. Come on Motown, take a hint. We'll never get tired of the ""Classic Five."""
4,NEW 70'S MUSIC TO ME,I got this last week never having heard of it and with no review's i took a chance and i am glad i did. This is a 2 cd set with cd #2 being live. It is really hard to define there music but there is some very good guitar playing especially in the live cd. The muscian's are tight i guess you could say they play a lot of different music pop/rock/a little country/blue's very good stuff. If you want to try something new from the 70's i would suggest this. I like to find old stuff from that time period that i like and this was worth the price. The opening of the story behind Mendelbaum on the liner note's state's mendelbaum was different. Musically led by the lighting fast ripping lick's of chris michie's cherry red 1968 gibson sg special. He write's most of the song's and his solo's are tight. There are five member's in the band guitar organ bass keyboard's and drum's. Very fresh music from the 70's i hope you like it as much as i have good stuff.
2,naw,"what makes Cameo interesting are the vocals, in particluar Larry Blackmon. all this cd does is take the songs we know and extend the fairly boring base drums ect. they sound computer generated to me."
5,Fabulous !,"I saw this wonderful lady on GAC ( great american country )( music ). She didn't look like most of the country singers, so, I watched her video. I was instantly delighted ! Her voice is clear, and pure. Her music is folk, as she's from Ireland. I have 3 of her cd's now, and will get more. I love just siting back and listening to this marvelous voice. No matter what your favorite type of music is, I urge you to listen to just one of her songs, I promise you that you'll be hooked."
1,Very disapointed badddd,"What a bad cameraI had many cameras and this is the wroste one !10 megapixels?? i dont think soA 5 megapixel old camera i had was much nicer then this oneand if you have kids forget about it, its slow faces washes out and blurr problemdont recommend at all.i change it for the sony w90 and what a difference !"
5,Exceptional research & story,"Written by one who understands the point of AA and cares deeply about telling the story correctly, faults and all. Cooperation was given by people who never have been quoted simply because the incredible author is fair and trustworthy, and an interesting writer."
2,20 $ for a small bottle of old spice,"just go to walmart and buy a gallon of old spice for 5 bux, b/c that is essentially what this stuff smells like..it's not particularly good or anything, not sure why it has such high reviews, shipping was a little slow as well."
2,broom holder,I am not happy with the broom holder as the broom keeps falling out no matter how high or low you put the broom it just wont stay.
1,difficult to place the broom,difficult to place the broom inside the holes and take it back...hook are good for the hand brush... I will not recommend..
1,Cheap!,"Don't waste your money - this is cheap, cheap, cheap!The flaps for the mop/broom don't stay on - they fall off. I wish I hadn't ordered."
3,Evil Labels,"I bought this (locally for $4.99, which seems to be the standard hardware store price) but had to comment here. The tray is cool; I have embedded a layer of 16ga steel in my boat's lab bench for magnetic fixturing, and this is exactly the kind of thing that's useful. The magnet is plenty strong enough for this application.But that label is extremely nasty. Even using Bestine, which generally makes short work of such adhesives, I had to scrape at it for a good 10-15 minutes before it was finally clean. And then, surprise, I noticed a second label on the outside... very absurd for a stainless dish: ""WARNING - this product contains chemicals, including lead, known to the state of California to cause birth defects and other reproductive harm. WASH HANDS AFTER HANDLING.""Seriously?"
4,Useful little tray,"small and handy, it's stupid to spend this amt on a small tray, but definitely useful. Saves you the trouble of missing screws when you accidentally knock it over."
5,An Excellent Companion to the Harry Potter Books,"""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" truly is an excellent companion to the Harry Potter books.Written in J.K. Rowling's consistantly humorous style, the book is interesting, and to prevent the information from becoming boring, there are lots of funny remarks and comments supposedly ""written"" by Harry Potter and Ron Weasley, two of the Harry Potter books' main characters.It is also fascinating - if you observe the book carefully, you will see how much effort has been put into it to make it look like it really DID come right out from Harry's world.This book is a must for Harry Potter fans everywhere, but should only be read after completing the main books, as otherwise it will not be as easy to understand. Also, from purchasing this book, you will have the pleasure of knowing that you have helped a great cause, no matter where you might be."
4,A bemusing peek at the fauna of Harry Potter's world.,"""Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them,"" by Newt Scamander and J.K Rowling, is an interesting companion to the main series of novels. Telling us about seventy-five animals, this book offers more information on some of the creatures we've seen (the Acromantula and the Basilisk, for example) while offering tantalizing glimpses of what may yet come (I for one would love to see a Nundu or a Lethifold).This book is rather abbreviated (I wish *my* textbooks were this short), and so I can only give it 4 stars. Still, it's definitely worth the small amount it costs to purchase,..."
1,Baffling choices,"I can't believe that an afficionado would pick out these tracks. They contain *no* essential recordings and far too much soloing by mediocre sidemen. I wonder if it's because the label couldn't get the rights to the really great stuff.One disc should contain 15 to 20 Parker tunes, not the handful offered here. Look elsewhere, unless you already own a lot of Bird--for instance to the 1- or 3-disk Savoy and Dial reissues or the Rhino set. It's the Savoy and Dial sessions that everyone raves about."
3,Bargain only if upgrade to Edimax BR-6524K firmware v1.44,"I bought this because it seemed like a real bargain and would allow me to take advantage of 2 DSL lines. I had many issues with the network going down after one day, the router not responding to HTTP, etc. I finally disconnected it. Well, I decided to open it up and did some research. I found that the H2BR4 uses the identical board as the Planet XRT-402D and the Edimax BK-6524K. Only those are hard to find and cost more.I upgraded to version 1.42 of the XRT-402D firmware and got improved reliability. Feeling adventurous, I upgraded to version 1.44 of the Edimax BK-6524K firmware. Inspecting the firmware images for the H2BR4, XRT-402D, and BK-6524K revealed that they use the same firmware written for the BK-6524K. You can find these alternative firmware on the Planet and Edimax websites.I finally found the bargain I was looking for. This product would have received 5 stars had Hawking Tech shipped it with version 1.44 firmware."
5,This book is something else...,"and that's a good thing. I was studying for an exam and so I took a much needed study break and decided to read just the prolgue. Big mistake. I was so into the book, I ended up staying up until I read the whole thing.BJ knows how to write a novel where the reader feels like they are apart of it. Everything went together like a puzzle.At times I was laughing so hard my roommates came to investigate, there are some funny moments in this book. The characters are so memorable.From the moment Neil and Olivia meet, there was an instant attraction and this was when Neil and his brother were robbing the train Olivia was on.A must read!"
4,Great book for colored pencils.,"Ann Kullberg's book is great for anyone who has a hard time trying to get realistic results for colored pencils. The technique she uses is superb and she goes into great detail on which colors should be used to get the best results. However, this does not mean that what she uses is the best technique for whatever you do. An artist, depending on his or her skill, will still have to go through trial and error before he/she gets the results he/she is looking for. This book has definitely helped hone my colored pencil technique. This book could have used more ethnic examples and different types of lighting. Overall, I would recommend this for anyone learning how to use colored pencil."
5,An Indespensible Book!!,"This book is a ""must-have"" for anyone interested in portraits or color pencil art. It covers the application of colors and values better than almost any other book I've read. It also walks you through the full process of creating a color pencil painting as well or better than the other books I've studied. I'm keeping this book within reach because I know I'm going to wear it out cosulting it over and over!!"
5,Kal Ho Naa Ho [Soundtrack],"I have fallen in love with the soundtrack of Kal Ho Naa Ho, one of Yash Raj's exceptional films (again). If you watch the film before you purchase the soundtrack, you'll understand why the music is soooo beautiful. Also, I am not Indian and I am still in love with the music. You DON'T need to understand the language to love the music. I love this soundtrack and I HIGHLY recommend you to buy this..."
5,one of tthe best films I've ever seen,"Excellent film filled with a little bit of everything. Most importantly, taught me appreciation of the Coast Guard . Ashton Kutcher's acting was A plus. Will purchase for my collection. Go see it, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Coast Guard Recruiting Film,"The Guardian (DVD)The Guardian, starring Kevin Costner is about a senior chief petty officer who suffers some psychological trauma on a rescue operation and is ordered to transfer to the U. S. Coast Guard's Air-Sea Rescue Training School.The majority of the movie is taken up with pretty standard ""Boot Camp"" stuff with Costner riding this one trainee pretty hard.All in all a pretty fair movie. Possibly the best that Costner has done since Dances With Wolves.Definitely recommended for U.S. Coast Guard fans and for people who like to go out in the ocean in small boats.Gunner August 2007"
3,Watchable,"Costner made one great movie. This isn't it. However, I will watch the movie again because I was entertained."
4,"what you'd expect , but still entertaining","If you read the premise of this movie, you could almost take out the USCG and insert other similar movies whereby the star goes through the rigors of training, throw in a personal relationship and add some career field related drama at the end, and you've got the idea...definitely cut from the same cloth as officer and a gentleman, top gun, Cuba Gooding Jr. in Men of Honor, and the inferior Annapolis. Aside from the predictability, this one is still entertaining and well done, although rather long. I agree that the rescue scenes were powerful and dramatic. Costner was very good and Kucher does better in this than some of his other dramas."
3,It's ok.,"This movie is a really good movie. I saw it in theaters when it first came out, but the moive I got from Amazon skips a whole chapter."
5,The Gauardian,This is a good movie with a nice twist at the end. Plus it takes you into the world of Coast Guard rescue swimmers.
2,"once again, without feeling","You have seen this movie before. Many times before. Burnt-out vet sent back to teach school; hot-shot rookie with something to prove. Resulting inevitable conflict, reconciliation, and sometimes final tragedy. (Ie, the father figure dies, the son(now reonciled with father) carries on.)This movie, or its variants, has been made about every other branch of the service, so now it's time to trot out the same tired routine about the Coast Guard. While it's interesting to learn about what the Guard does, as a movie, there was not a single new or original thought, twist, or character. You've seen it before; don't waste your time by seeing it again."
1,Upset,"The Dvd I purchased off of Amazon.com did not work. It was their ""prime"" as well, which is even more frustrating because it is guaranteed to work."
4,Holds up to play...,"I bought this after getting my two 50+ pound dogs the football. The only problem I've had with it, is it is starting to rip where there is a manufactured hole for making the ball. That seems to be the spot my one dog likes to pick up the ball from. Other than that, it is providing plenty of exercise for them!"
4,Works as expected,"I have three of these units and have been happy with them. I agree with another review that it's large and heavy. As I use them for security, I want them to be visible and built strong. The quality is excellent. The dome screws off easy to allow for cleaning or to make adjustments to the camera."
4,An enjoyable read,"You know what? This is a good book. It won't teach you anything historic about brainwashing or mind control, and it was published in 1978, so ritual abuse is barely even a topic yet, but it will pull it all together so you can see a bigger picture, and perhaps what may be involved in confronting it.The characters are well drawn, and the author is well versed in psychic subject matter, which is good in and of itself in order to add to the credibility of the story. It is well written, and the ending takes you to surprising places. All in all, an enjoyable read."
2,"Wagner, Tannhauser","Not much stage craft here, this is a older version of the opera,the performers were true to the script, but not the most attractive that I have seen with the exception of the final scene, this did not hold up to current theatre"
1,Performance riddled by poor singing,"This isn't a good performance. Cassily just copes with the difficult title part. Marton doesn't really have the purity of voice for Elisabeth. Troyanos is over-streched as Venus and Weikl past his prime as Wolfram. With such poor singing, this dvd cannot be recommended."
5,A wonderful find.,"I just love this book. I bought it 6 months ago, and have read it twice. I know that I will refer to it often, as it is dense with truly useful information. It is true that is a bit small, but so what? I look for solid instruction -- not coffee table material with glossy pictures and fluffy prose. Thanks, Steve."
2,"Moderately helpful, but nothing special","This book focuses mainly on still life and landscape painting, and is not at all a comprehensive guide. While it contains some helpful tidbits, it does not really elaborate on the fundamentals of painting with oils. Containing the cursory beginners chapters, Oil Painting for the Serious Beginner waxes lyrical on the intangible je-ne-sais-quois of art. This is hardly helpful. Also, it strongly pushes alla prima painting, while basically ignoring any other style. Not at all comprehensive, and on the whole mediocre. Definitely one of the lesser books in my oil painting book collection - especially considering the price. I would recommend Frederic Taubes' ""Oil Painting for the Beginner"" for those who want to really understand the fundamentals of oil painting: the interaction between the oil paints, what paints to use for what, comprehensive color theory in an easy to understand manner, etc. This book is mediocre at best"
3,Oil Painting for the Serious Beginner,"This is a well thought out book and very helpful, I'm slightly put off by the ""red"" of most of his paintings, but I like what he has to say about oil painting."
3,No Room For Parvez Musharraf?,Musharraf holds the dubious distinction of arguably becoming history's first Military Dictator who not once but TWICE crapped all over the constitution of Pakistan. This and the giddy conceit of his self worshipping book surely increases his chances tenfold of making the list in the next edition?
1,"Disgraceful! This book deserves a ""0""","The author has included, our sitting president, George W. Bush, as one of the 20 ""Dictators"" in his book. Don't be fooled by the cover photos and book title. The author's true agenda is evident.Shame on this blatant leftist attempt to mock our president in such a disgraceful manner."
1,Mistake in Product Features,"Noticed that the Product Features section claims that this product has a freespooling clutch. This is not correct for Model 1401. Model 1406 will free spool, but this is not the product listed. Just thought you would want to know."
4,Techincal!,"Great book if you want to know the chemical process of cheese making. I was hoping for more recipes for goat's milk. That being said, it was a great book to help understand the process of cheese making."
3,Playing it safe,"This is a traditional period Boccanegra (rather gloomy sets) with Milnes suitably imposing in the name part. That said, his voice is not at its best and Anna Tomowa-Sintow as Amelia is a little too matronly for my tastes. She sings affectingly when required to, though, which is more than can be said of Gabriele (Vasile Moldoveanu), probably the weakest of the principals. In the pit, James Levine drives the music too hard, so climaxes are inclined to be a touch overpowering and not a little brash. If you want to hear the subtleties and nuances of the score try the audio recording conducted by Abbado on DG - quite a revelation, and well cast, too). Video director Brian Large (usually reliable) is caught out a few times and there is the odd sensation as singers move from one side of the stage to the other and the vocal image falters, caught in a no man's land between the microphones. Very distracting. In sum, watchable enough but not one to die for."
1,That was just awful,"Jan Hammer's 2004 re-recordings of several of Miami Vice's indelible themes succeeds only in sanding off all of the crispness and sharp edges that were in the originals. The Hammer tracks from the original soundtrack release were edgy and sometimes brash, not to mention *clean*. The revisions are indeed lush, but if you're looking to be taken back to the sound that was Miami Vice, you won't find it here. Alas, what you will find is something akin to elevator music -- slowed down, ""easy listening"" pieces that leave you itching to hear the real thing."
3,Good but..!,The quality is not super but you may like it as a standard keyboard for windows. It helps in working with Pro Tools but when you press the buttons you feel the quality is not like regular keyboards.
4,LAST HURRAH FROM MASTER OF RECORDED SOUND,"ENO DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR EXPANDING THE BOUNDERIES OF MODERN MUSIC. FROM HIS EARLY STUFF WITH ROXY MUSIC TO HIS PRODUCTION WORK WITH U2 & BOWIE. THIS MAY NOT BE HIS BEST{BEFORE & AFTER SCIENCE AND GREEN WORLD ARE 5 STARS}, BUT IT IS THE BETTER OF HIS MORE RECENT SOLO ALBUMS. ROBERT FRIPP IS A BLAST AS USUAL. AMBIENT FANS BEWARE: THIS WILL KEEP YOU AWAKE AT NITE."
5,Great for pros,"I just picked this book off my bookshelf where it has been since I bought it maybe six years ago.I didn't ""get it"" then, but now I feel this small yet mighty makeup book may be my favorite in my collection.As other reviewers mentioned, this book is pure imagery--don't expect a tutorial. If you are a makeup artist looking for some inspirational work that in my opinion was years ahead of its time, pick up this little gem."
2,2 broken bowls,"The first shipment had two broken bowl handles, Amazon sent another set at no charge but I had to go to the post office to return the broken bowls. Packaging needs to be improved."
2,Doesn't do well with urine,It got up my dogs poo and vomit.. but the urine seemed to spread and stayed stained. It wouldn't lift the urine. It also took a LOT of solution to lift just a few spots. I don't recommend.
5,This stuff is great! And Amazon's price is almost half of the pet speciality stores!,"This stuff is terrific! If you do what all of the dog books say (Cesar Milan, Ian Dunbar, Brian Kilcommons) and put this on a pee accident and then a paper towel covered with newspaper, the accident is gone and the smell is, too!!We have four dogs --wouldn't be without it!!"
4,Nature's Miracle Stain Remover - Works,"A well-designed product that when given time works. This product does not work the second you apply it. However, over a number of days (as indicated on the bottle) the product reactivates the odor only to eliminate it.I would recommend this product to anyone that is dealing with urine odors sunk into their carpet."
1,doesn't work,I bought this based on the description and people's review. I was training a puppy. Needless to say that the puppy kept going to the same area where he made the mistake. I followed directions but it didn't remove the odor well enough. Next time I will stick to simple green or citrusolve.
4,Be Prepared to Pour it On,"It's hard for me to tell if my repeated applications solved my problem, or if my fourth and last application (in which I liberally poured the solution on the foul-smelling spot) was the key.Here's my situation: having just moved in to a new home, I noticed, on one hot day, a horrible, stale urine STANK, coming off the carpet in one of my bedrooms. The carpet is speckled Berber. I could see nothing on it, but after crawling around for 30 minutes, I was able to masking-tape a circle around the roughly 6-foot-square spot of offensiveness. I bought 34 oz. of this product, sprayed the spot liberally, and applied a fan to it. Nothing. Repeated applications followed. Finally, after returning to the store for a gallon, I poured the junk on, let it sit for an hour, used 6 towels to blot up the excess, and left the spot to dry, with no fan. A couple of days have passed, and I am just now able to say I can only barely smell the urine odor when I put my face to the floor."
1,Didn't work,Cleaned up after my pup with this...he returned to the exact same area again...so does not work as it is supposed to...made my floors sticky with residue as well--had to mop 3 times to remove all residue.
2,disappointed,"As a current user of old WoD I find fewer and fewer places to use the system. A lot of people have embraced the new order and so I bought this book to continue my shifter role playing. While the new system simplifies some combat and scenarios, I hate it. Hate it hate it hate it. Mostly because I can't play using just this book! It's a core book for crying out loud. But the section that should cover skills/abilities/etc has far too many paragraphs ending in ""Please see World of Darkness, pg XX"". Why did I bother buying the shifter book when all I need is the other core book (which appears to be 35 pages long). I will just look harder for the old WoD and wait until White Wolf comes out with a better, less 'squeeze the players for everything they got' game."
2,This project should have been forsaken,"I think the quote""If it isn't broke don't fix it"" applies the best here. The retooling of the system made it easier to deal with for new players. But for older players such as myself it would intend to change all that has come before. It turns tribes into""clubs"" where one must petition to join. This book throws off everything that I do to run a game. And I do not intend to use it. I did however love the art, that was all I rated this book on."
5,Timeless:,"That's what we call all of the late Chuck's work. What makes it so? The failure to duplicate. New Age Music has evolved into a generic blend, but there has only been One Chuck Greenberg and this album is his first and only solo endeavor. Originally released in 1991, many consider it to be his finest ever. My favorite track is ""Two-Headed Alarm Clock,"" named after the Greenberg twins by Alex De Grassi, who also adds some of his finest guitar work on tracks like ""The Secret of Time."" Audiophiles who've come to expect the finest in sound quality from Chuck and Shadowfax will not be disappointed. Nine years later, this impeccably recorded album remains superior to most music released today."
5,"On the otherside of ""dance"" music is art","I can understand how someone looking for a banging techno record could be dissapointed, but this doesn't even look like a banging techno record. Also anyone who is a LG fan will know that he is much deeper than your run of the mill EDM artist. This album is a masterpiece, my favorit part of some of the tracks is that they bring in 1 drum, like the begining of a build and then pull back completely. Plastikman fans, IDM fans, Jazz fans and people who enjoy really interesting use of sounds will LOVE this album. (I say this because the previous descrition describes me). Bottom line, not a DANCE record not even a CHILL record, this is beatnick breaks, IDM and spoken word nu jazz (fusion, not lounge) at its absolute FINEST"
4,"Me 262, Arrow to the Future","When this book was published in 1980 it was the standard work about the Me 262, and it seems to have started an avalanche of new books about the plane. Of all publications about the Me 262 that I own it is the only one that still can be bought, a tribute to its quality. Though riddled with small (printing?)mistakes in the German words used in the text -only to be spotted by people speaking that language I hope-, it remains a good and affordable book, specially when compared to the latest blockbusters about the Me 262."
2,Disappointed,"There are some very nice nuggets in this book, and it has a great message. However, calling it ""a novel"" on the cover is stretching reality. It has a flimsy plot and story line; it is more a series of little vignettes about happiness than a novel. Also be forewarned, it is a very light read! It only has 152 pages, and on those pages the type is at least 14 pt. with spaces in between each paragraph. You can finish this book in a day or two.I purchased this book because of all the great reviews it had received, and this is the same reason I am compelled to write my own review. I was disappointed because I was expecting ""a novel"". This would be better as a touching email forward about happiness, than as a book..."
2,Not to be compared with Tom Clancy,"I was expecting some magical things or misteries to be solved when I read the backpage: Some doors are meant to remain unopened. But what I found is unbelievable stories and a superhero which can do nearly unbelievable things. Some parts are to much detail. Please count and find out yourself Thehow many pages the author described about the pursuit in the river. Anyway,some pages are interesting to follow."
2,unbelievable............,"I enjoyed this book for the first third of the story. Somewhere around that point I found myself becoming bored. Not that there wasn't plenty of action, there was. It was just way beyond plausible. I really enjoy this type of story, but it need to be credible. This was incredible."
3,Need an action fix?,"Look no further than Matt Reilly. Many complain that his books are over-loaded with totally unbelievable action scenes and poorly researched facts...this is all true. But just like the best junk food sometimes you just have to indulge yourself. This is my second Reilly book so I knew what to expect. Though he may not be an artiste he sure as hell is entertaining.As I mentioned in my review of ICE STATION, with a little restraint this author could have written an intelligent thriller that would entertain more fully. But if you have a long plane ride or expect a lenghty wait in a doctor's waiting room take TEMPLE or ICE STATION with you. It definitly beats reading out-of-date TIME or NEWSWEEK magazines."
1,Insults the reader,"This book is insulting to the intelligence of its readers. This writer obviously did ABSOLUTELY NO RESEARCH of any kind into the science of the subject about which he is unsuccessfully attempting to write. Anyone with an 8th grade education would be dismayed by this writer's grasp of science. It is OK to be ignorant about a subject, but don't stick your finger in the public's eye by writing about it."
2,Gets repetitive and tiresome quickly,"At first ""Temple"" is a kick, with exciting action scenes and an exotic setting, but it wears out its welcome quickly with one dimensional characters and one improbable miracle escape after another. It starts to get absurd, how the hero gets so lucky in escaping from what seems to be fatal peril, only to have some almost impossible random event happen for him to survive yet again by a whisker. Granted, the author is good at writing action scenes, but after a while they all run together and get rather dull. Almost zero character development doesn't help matters."
5,Review of Temple,"I chose to rate this book 5 stars because it is a replacement for the copy one of my dogs chewed up. I love the book. Good story telling, a great adventure, it reminds me of the great adventure novels by H. Rider Haggard."
3,Temple,"Typical Matthew Reilly novel plenty of fast pace action, Main charactor could have been a little stronger to make his actions more convincing, but overall good story."
4,Great holiday read,"For those of you who can still remember Alistair MacLean, this book is in a similar style, and I really enjoyed it. OK, some of it just isn't believable and it's not going to win the Booker Prize, but it's a really good read, especially for vacations. It's a tribute to Matt Reilly that he can keep the action going through 700 pages - I waa so enthralled, I didn't even feel the need to turn to the end to see what happened!!"
2,Temple,"Uh....I am not even done this book yet, and today it almost went into the trashcan. I usually like just about anything, and I did like Ice Station an am looking forward to grabbing a copy of Area 7, but this book is a bit too much. It's like reading James Bond on steroids...too many increadible feats, too many ""saved at the last minute"" senarios. Uh...I'll keep reading though. Good reading all."
2,The concept is good but where's the plot?,"Ever since I had caught a glance of the beautiful artwork on the covers of the various volumes to this anime, I've wanted to see if it was as good on the inside. While 'Legend of Black Heaven' is funny, quirky and breaks the norm as far as heros, this is brought down by several factors:- Poor animation. No, I don't need CGI. But let's face it, the 80's are done.- Little actual plot. Yes, we have the basics - but this anime seems to be totally about funny skits and laughs. While laughs are good, there has to be some meat and bone to the anime itself to make the humorous parts great. An anime that is nothing but humor gets tiring to watch.As I said, it's a wonderful ideal. Hard rock saves space. Who doesn't like that concept? However, the anime section of this could have been done better and made this a true classic rather than a nice giggly watch."
3,very Americanized album for a british guitar man Blackmore,"yes the set is very Americanized for a great british guitar man like Blackmore. Lyn Turner is a good talented singer but unfortunately he sounds like Bon Jovi Pop songs. I prefer the first albums of Rainbow with DIO on voice. The Rainbow old albums such as RISING, ON STAGE, LONG LIVE ROCK N ROLL were a typical heavy rock LP'S. But this one is a POP album and very Americanized california glam sound. What a pity!--------------------------------------------------------------------------------"
2,Oh dear; the writing is on the wall!,"This album was the end of the road for me and Rainbow - I really thought they had completely lost it - some nice cheesy tracks such as ""Stone Cold"" but really the edge was gone and it was time to pack it in with stuff like ""Death Alley Driver""."
5,feels like the 80s all over again,i remember listening to this album in the early 80s in my buddy's 1970 chevy nova with slicks and a glass pack... it sounded good then (the album that is) and still sounds good now. good purchase.
5,GUTTER BUTTER!,"TUBAS AND ORGANS AND DRUMS...OH MY! THIS IS JUST A FUN ALBUM AND A DIFFERENT LISTENING EXPERIENCE THAN ANYTHING ELSE YOU WILL EVER, EVER, EVER HEAR ON RADIO. IT'S NOT P-FUNK FUNKY, BUT DEFINITELY THE TYPE OF FUNK YOU WOULD EXPECT FROM LIKE A MATURED, DEEP SOUTHERN, HALFTIME MARCHING BAND...WHICH IS ALWAYS THE BEST PART OF A FOOTBALL GAME, ANYWAY. GET THIS AND EXPAND YOUR LISTENING RESPONSIBILITIES...PLUS IT'S JUST GOOD."
4,"Not the Easiest to Clean, but Good","I work with long equations and feel guilty about killing trees as I endlessly rewrite them, so chalkboards remain my go-to solution. I honestly cannot tell the difference between this and the more expensive brands, except when it comes time to erase and start again. My trusted eraser, which still works in a classroom, doesn't do it for this board. I've resorted to using a rag and some water to clean it instead. I've tried chalking it up, I've tried writing lighter, but I prefer the absolute clean to the ghosting this board is susceptible to, so I wash it clean frequently.There has not been any splintering or shadowing from the colored chalk. We had a misadventure with a white board marker on the frame and corner, but a little rubbing alcohol took that off. All in all, it does it's job and hangs innocuously on a wall like any other."
4,An amazing journey,"Rachel Chencinski Roth tells an amazing tale of survival in this fascinating autobiography. She survived three Nazi camps using ingenuity and guided by faith. She vividly remembers the Poland of her youth, her experiences with family and friends, and contrasts that boldly against the horror of the Holocaust experience. Where the book suffers, is in the translation from Polish. The beautiful and poignant desciptions of her day to day existence contrast markedly from the simplistic dialogue.Once involved in her saga, I found myself unable to put the book down."
4,DVD Gary Cooper film,Friendly PersuasionA heart warming film about a Quaker family and their peaceful existence during the american civil war between the states. Cooper at his finest. Well worth a watch.
5,Historical perspective,"This movie is based on an actual event. July 9th, 1863 two Confederate cavalry brigades numbering 2,000 men & 4 artillery pieces (commanded by John Hunt Morgan) forced the Ohio River just west of Louisville, Kentucky. They encountered 400-450 Indiana militia at Corydon,Indiana in Harrison County. The Confederates won a short vicious battle, resulting in 11 Southerners killed & 40 wounded. Union casualties were 4 killed, 10-20 wounded. Three civilians were killed. Although the short battle cost the cavalry twice as many casualties, the fight enabled Morgan to secure supplies and money before continuing his raid through Indiana and into Ohio. Morgan's troopers were pursued by 6,000 Union cavalry, who prevented his recrossing of the Ohio River. Morgan was forced to surrender. The Battle of Corydon was the only pitched battle of the Civil War that occurred in Indiana. The battle has been reenacted annually since the 1980's."
5,"""I Will Not Harm Thee"" ~ Can Family, Faith And Passivism Endure In Time Of War?","`Friendly Persuasion released in '56 is a life affirming tale of faith, family and passivism against the heartbreaking backdrop of the bloody American Civil War. Directed by William Wyler the film focuses on a small Quaker community in the South, more specially on one particular family in that community, the Birdwell's.This quiet, contemplative community is turned upside down when war is declared between North and South and the sound of gunfire and conflict draws ever closer. With the inevitable intrusion of the outside world comes the expected re-evaluation of both individual and community beliefs and what actions must be taken to protect family and property. Can passivism survive in a time of war?Starring two of my favorites, Gary Cooper (Jess Birdwell) and Dorothy McGuire (Eliza Birdwell). Also wonderful performance by Anthony Perkins as Josh Birdwell.Highly recommended!"
2,slow,"Some funny moments, etc., but this movie was too slow. Granted it was made when people had longer attention spans. But a dated movie is a dated movie."
2,Not so good,This book said that Jack had dirty shoes. Children who read it WILL follow them and get scolded by their parents to proof that they can follow the story. So please don't ever write like this okay!!!!!
4,Great Game,"I agree with the one review that the side by side view was a dumb idea. Beside that i can't complain about anything else, except that now when i see it in the arcade i dont want to play it. It's fast paced and very replayable... You can go through as one player either person one or two which give you a different angle."
2,Good chinrest in poor condition,"The metal feet on the chinrest I received were bent out of shape. I had to force them to bend back straight to even attempt to fit it on an instrument. Even now, it does not sit totally flat, and I will be ordering another elsewhere."
2,"Works to Charge, not to Synch","This worked to charge my PDA but I could not use this to synch at all. Perhaps there is a way but I have not and do not have the time to figure it out. IF the cradle works this should work, I thought. I can only use this to charge."
2,Most Over-rated text in Histotechnology,"This is without doubt, the most over-rated histotechnology textbook on the market. The reason for it's success is because it has been pushed by the ASCP and is used for the foundation of the ASCP histotechnology examination (again extremely poor curriculum and examination).If you really want to understand the science behind histotechnology and not a cook-book format, you must read either John Kiernan's ""Histological and Histochemical Methods: Theory and Practice"" or John Bancroft's ""Theory and Practice of Histological Techniques"""
3,Spectrum Brands/ B & D HS1000 Handy Steamer,DISAPOINTED WITH THE SIZE OF THE RICE MAKER PART.THOUGHT THAT DESICRIPTION SHOULD BETTER EXPLAIN THE SMALLNESS.OTHERWISE THE BLACK AND DECKER PRODUCT IS EXCELLENT
5,Perfect..,"I don't need to say much more than this.... I have thousands of albums in my library (including rock, jazz and classical), and this would have to be a candidate for my favorite album of all time. The song-writing is beautiful and the instrumentation is mind-boggling. Just wonderful music...."
4,the perils of vulcanology,"Galeras is a Colombian volcano within hiking distance of the Colombian town of Pasto. When it showed increased activity, several scientists were killed in a minor eruption that made headlines, and provoked controversy: mainly about whether or not the scientists' deaths could have been prevented.Williams book is a well written personal account of the disaster and of William's life afterward, including his struggle with his injuries and his guilt over whether he could have better predicted and prevented the deaths.For those interested in vulcanology, it would be a good introduction on what scientists do to monitor dangerous volcanos, and the very real risk that many of them take with little publicity to protect hundreds of thousands of lives of those people living within the shadow of these dangers."
2,Boring,"I really wanted to like this book. It is being promoted as the next Into Thin Air and suspense and excitement are promised. But in the end, it is a slow and clunky read, full of constant digressions - at least two dozen - away from the ""action."" And then the end of the book is a complete mess. Reading it, I can't help but feel that Stanley Williams and his writer Fen Montagne were not clicking - a problem that I've noticed in other co-authored books. By the last half of the book, there is so much repetition and the story has such a lack of flow that it becomes a chore to finish, and the climax - which is no surprise at all - is dull.I also find Williams hard to like - he comes across as insecure and insensitive, and his manner of storytelling is so predictably macho that it gets boring fast. Too bad - it seemed like an exciting story."
4,Nice new role for Jackie,"Will Smith son stars in this and he does well but I just dont like these young kids starring in movies they tend to grow up to become arrogant teens (I.E. Bow wow) Anyways I enjoyed this film. Jackie Chan plays a role Ive never seen him play before, but he still kicks some butt too. I watched it with a younger crowd they seemed to have enjoyed it aswell."
1,Mediocre remake!,"I just watched the remake of the Karate Kid. Compared to the original movie, this remake is mediocre. Jaden Smith's acting is borderline at best, you really don't care much about his character. Jackie Chan did what he could with the limitations of his part. I thought the woman who played his mother, did a decent job. Outside of that, don't waste your money on this remake. Purchase the original!!"
4,The Karate Kid [Blu-ray],"After all, Jackie Chan do his best acting for this movie, I'm very enjoy and two tumbs up for this family movie"
2,Acting over done,The original was so much better. The story line was grasping at straws and the acting was very poor. The disk was bare bones. I was disappointed.
1,I think the Disc was defective,I bought this as a gift for my cousin for Christmas. When he tried to take the disc out of the DVD case the DVD snapped in half. He's 10 so he isn't particularly strong but DVD's generally don't break that easily.
3,Misleading Title,"In the United States, it was released as THE KARATE KID based on the popular 1984 film and film series starting in 1984 of the same name. It was releasd under the title THE BEST KID in Japan and South Korea. Appropriately, it was releasd as THE KUNG FU KID in China. The title baffled some people when the movie's film production, and story remake was set in ...China? (with Chinese/Hong Kong action star Jackie Chan in the mentoring role{?} originated by Japanese-American actor Pat Morita). At least producer, Will Smith, whose son, Jaden is in the title role, didn't play the mentor. Karate is a Japanese art form and Kung Fu is a Chinese art form. Well, it didn't baffle moviegoers too much because it made enough bucks and critical praise to garner a planned sequel. The filmmakers should have just titled it THE MARTIAL ARTS KID, or even better..THE ULTIMATE FIGHTING KID."
4,Kungfu kid,The movie turned out much better then I thought it would. I really liked it. Much better then the bad 1980s version.
3,New generation of high kickers,"The story is basically the same with the setting changed to China, the kid is AA instead of Caucasian, the martial arts are kung fu instead of karate and the fact that Jackie Chan really knows martial arts whereas Pat Morita did not. You can really tell that Jaden Smith worked hard on his techniques and makes quite a transformation to a buff little kid. It is a little faster paced than the original. For die-hard fans of the original, no remake could live up to its reputation, but I enjoyed it, my kid loved it; in fact, when we saw it in the theatre, it was packed and the whole audience cheered at the end, so I would say it definitely works as a stand alone project."
1,Bad shipping,"The product is a great item, the problem is getting one shipped to you in whole. After two trys and both times the casement or parts of the A/C was broken when it arrived."
1,Wish I had one,"I had the item shipped to me two times and both times it was damaged, so I have no idea how well this item works."
4,Bonobo - Pick Up,"Bonobo's PICK UP single delivers exactly that: a nice musical pick-up to your day. The title track is a more upbeat number, a nice contrast to Bonobo's well-known downtempo work, while the b-side, ""Behind the Light"" is exactly that downtempo of which I speak, with the guitar riff and quiet instrumentation playing complementing the beats perfectly. Ah, if only all pick ups were so easy."
1,try again pimpen,I'm going to be to the point this album is a piece of sh**. If anyone likes this album you need to be listening to country music. First off this is not the lyrical Kurupt that I remember his flow is extermly week and he is saying out dated rhymes all he says during the entire album is pu**y this pu**y that. I remember back in the day his rhymes were so tight you would be like rewind that again. The only song on this entire album worth listening to is nina breeda. So basically listening to this album is a waste of energy.
3,ANY LEFT IN THE KURUPT?,"WITH THE 5TH SOLO ALBUM FROM KURUPT HE RELEASE AN ALBUM FULL OF GANGSTA, AND WESTCOAST MUSIC THAT ONLY THE DPG KNOWS HOW TO DO. BUT AFTER LISTENING YOU WONDER WHAT DOES KURUPT ACTUALLY HAVE TO OFFER HIS SUBJECT MATTER IS VERY BORING, AND PLAYED OUT FOR A 33 YEAR OLD MAN TO BE TALKING ABOUT. ITS OBVIOUS HIS LYRICS ARE GONE, I DONT KNOW IF ITS TOO MUCH SMOKING WEED, BUT THAT CAT FELL OFF. HE TENDS TO REPEAT WORDS, AND TRY TO USE SOME BIG WORDS, WHICH SEEMS NOT TO COME EASY FOR HIM, AS HE STRUGGLES TO SAY ANYTHING THATS SO AMAZING. THE BEATS ARE GOOD, BUT THEY ARE BORING, AND PLAYED OUT, AND SOUNDS ALITTLE TOO WATERDOWN. THIS ALBUM WOULD BE HEARD TODAY, AND FORGOT BEFORE YOU SLEEP TONIGHT. KURUPT AND DAZ NEED TO STEP IT UP, GROW UP, AND GET SOME SUBJECT MATTER, AND PUT MORE WORK IN THERE MATERIAL."
3,Maybe better fresh?,"I'm thinking maybe because these cookies had to travel over 1,000 miles over the course of a few days, they lost their luster? They looked and tasted like mass-produced store-bought cookies. I guess I was expecting something more like homemade cookies. They were nice and soft, though."
5,Not only for first time moms!,"There is a 4 1/2 year space between my last two children so it was like starting over. This book really helped me refresh my memory on all of the things I needed to get ready to have a newborn in the house. The ""My Book of Lists"" was a great help in this area too. This is a must read!"
3,"Good TV, bad design","This TV has a good picture, but what you will not see is that it is a DC powered TV. So, you buy a low profile, flat screen TV only to have to find a place to mount the external transformer. Neither Sony nor Amazon mention this fact."
4,A super slim phone with a great exterior and features,"Length:: 0:45 MinsThis is a quick video clip of the LG VX8700 I just bought. Check out how thin it is. The aluminum exterior is pretty sweet. I tried to show the interface, but the camera couldn't focus on the display. It's super sharp, though. A great phone that's like a Razr but with a much better and more stable interface."
5,Awesome!,This CD is great from start to finish. ALL of the songs are good which is a feat in itself. Buy it! You'll enjoy it immensely.
5,Diamond Rio Greatest Hits VOl. 2,"This was a great piece of work. These songs are awesome especially the songs, ""Jesus only cries and In GOD we still trust"", we needed this message and music so badly in our world today. The radio stations should do their part and play these constantly. We need to do more of these types of song and maybe America will wake up and take our country back. Cheryl Freeman-Kongorski"
1,"Disappointing, to say the least","I have purchased Wilton products in the past and they were great. but that was then and this is now. I do a lot of bread baking and these are without a doubt the thinnest pans I have ever seen. Hopefully they will work, but they are of such poor quality I feel they are a half a step above using paper. My bad.............as I should have looked. They are made in China (where else?)."
2,Nice idea BUT,"Nice idea but have found that have trouble getting both the handset and the bluetooth headset to charge at the same time if at all. The one or two times I have been able to get it to work - VERY SLOW! Almost faster to do one then the other, or have two separate chargers."
3,jesi's thoughts,"Of course it's not the best book Laura Dower has even printed; I mean when has someone NOT been Madison. Of course each time gets more complicated as if it's a mystery in itself. I think it was so cool and so wonderful that Madison could help out the elderly women, especially since her own memory is slowly slipping away from her. Could you even imagine not remembering who you are? How could you enjoy something when you can't even pull up your name? The most genius, creative, and amazing thing Madison ahs done was the life like snow globe. I can't think of any other gift Mrs. Romano would want to receive!"
1,Badly written story of amputee,If not for self publishing houses this book would never have made it to print. The book about a dancer named Antonio; who suffers The Repercussion of losing his leg in a hit and run accident is cumbersome and badly written.The author just did an awful job of what could have been a good read.
2,Inspiring Story -- The writer did not do it justice,"As a competitive dancer, an avid reader, and a writer, I was compelled to buy this book based on the reviews found here.While the story is an inspiring one, and does gives one some added ""fire"" to overcome adversity and difficulties, the book was cumbersome. The prose is weak and awkward -- to distraction-- with too much ""Tell what happened"" and not enough ""Show me what happened"";Even some of the basics of competitive dance was a bit of a jumble (and incorrect), which hurt credibility.I love to read, and Love to dance. But I had to put this book away after 40 pages. The writing is just too distracting and disjointed."
2,"have seeds, will travel",THE LIFE OF JOHNNY APPLESEED IN A seed SHELL. WHY DID HE WEAR A POT FOR A HAT? DID HE EAT ALL THOSE APPLES TO GET ALL THOSE SEEDS? WANT TO STUDY ABOUT WESTWARD EXPANSION? WHY AM I ASKING QUESTIONS WHEN I CAN READ THIS AGAIN ?
4,Like the ball - but the ball IS destroyable,"The ""tuff"" balls are said to be undestroyable - but Ive had a few experiences with any of those balls that have any sort of piec that has any separation. As you can see, it has the white line to look like a tennis ball, but the middle piece is actually GLUED onto th ball. Because of that - combined with the holes on the 2 sides - my dog was able to rip the entire middle piece off - but not in one nice piece - in a MILLION pieces!! Would not get this specific ball again - I like the tuff balls, but without anything that my dog can grab and rip off. Ball gets slimy when wet with drool, but thats ok....expected for a dog toy (but it does make fuzz and hair, etc stick tot heball)"
4,"Great photos, poor font choice","This is an excellent collection of Capa's work, it is organized well and one can trace his professional growth. I recommend this book with one concern: The publisher chose to use a font similar to a typewriter, to give the photos a feel for the WWII-era context... but the font is too light to read in many cases. Simply using a bolder typewriter font would have been fine, and earned this book a 5 star rating.I know this may seem picky, but what good are the details of his life if they cannot be read?"
2,Does Oasis have Artistic Integrity?,"1 star is reserved for bands like Creed and Three Doors Down. I give this single two stars because this band is a disappointment. There was a time when they brought something to the table. Noel's songwriting presented a unique pop melody. Not here. Not only did they rip off ""Street Fighting Man"" with this single, but the melody here is nearly identical to what is one of the most distinct melodies in rock n' roll. It's good that oasis is looking in different directions for influences, since their fans are growing up and their sound is becoming stale. Just because they have accents doesn't make their music exotic. With that said, they may have the capability of being a decent rock band so I hope the single isn't indicative of the album, good luck Oasis on creating original music."
4,Great book...,"This is probably my most favorite book of Jo Ann's and I've read all but one. The book came in good condition, but the service was sloooowwww.Took almost 3 weeks!"
1,not the greatest anything,"this shouldnt be volume 11, it should be volume 26,811. the books are only good to an extreme collector. i couldnt get past a single chapter. i have no attention span for this bore."
4,Great Read That Provided Great Insight,"I enjoyed this book so much that I read it in about 6 hours. Medley provided tremendous insight that helped to explain the context in which the case unfolded. Oddly, the descendents of some of the players are still alive and well in Louisiana. Fortunately, so is the fight for equality and justice!This book was the perfect read on the 50th anniversary of Brown v. Board of Education."
2,Temporary actuators.,"i've had these actuators on my front doors of my astro van for a month, and now they are toast. suddenly died... both of them at once... and bummer, i was just getting a kick out of having pdl. but since they are so cheap i'm going to order two more... gonna wire in a fuses too, not sure how many amps but i'll need four. Also going to purchase the swiss made ones too four times as expensive but, just in case... [..] a piece but beats paying 55 at the parts store."
4,Very good,"The author did a really good job of writng stories that were a page turner without compromising Christian integrity. Kudos to her, I hope she is encouraged to write many more."
2,Expected something better,"The book was okay. Some of the chapters were insightful, but overall not as inspirational as I had hoped."
2,Disappointing,There was not a heck of a lot of Native wisdom in this book. It was tedious to read and not worth the overall effort put in to find the tidbits of what the elders thought.
5,Perfect Blue Star Sapphire,This was a Christmas present to my husband. He had wanted one for many years. He is very pleased with it.
5,LOVE Lipstick Jungle,If you like Sex and the City- this is another must have for your collection! Not only have I read the book (loved that too) but I own this season and CAN NOT wait for Season 2 to come out in May. BUY IT!
5,Love It!,I got hooked on Season 2 and it inspired me to watch buy Season 2. I love this show. The three women are great. Not to mention Robert Buckley is beautiful. He's all the reason to watch!! I am a huge fan of Sex and the City and was sad to see it go. Lipstick Jungle is great!! I love it and am hoping they continue for Season 3.
5,Yay!,Great new show ... hope it does get a full second season. Enjoyable to watch such strong characters.
3,"Yes, frequency of urination","I was hoping the Claritin would help with my allergies, as I was extremely fatigued, which is a symptom of my allergies. Yes, I did feel better(not as tired), however, I have been getting up numerous times during the night with frequency issues. Will probably stop the product to see if these issues abate."
1,Upset,I love this story line and was having a hard time finding the video or DVD. I ordered this and still have not received it!!!!! I have written the seller and everything and still nothing....I am totally pissed!!!! Do not support this seller!
5,These have become my standard,"I switched to wool socks a year or so ago. I like the way they cushion my feet and the way they wick moisture away. They are now almost the only sock I wear for most of the year. The Smartwool brand has been dependable, and they socks come in a variety of useful colors. I find that they wash well without excessive shrinkage. There is a minimal amount of surface pilling when worn."
5,The Ultimate Sock,"These are the ultimate in warm sox. Look great, feel great and meet all expectations. I have a draw full of Smart Wool and would think of going through a winter without them."
4,More like LARGE,"Why is it so difficult to find LONG socks that don't bind and constrict? I wear a size 15 shoe and have a terrible time locating socks (and shoes) large enough. I do NOT need wide, diabetic socks, just long, comfy socks; not all TALL men are also BIG men! These look promising but the reality will be evident after some wearing and washing. One thing I've learned is to always air dry my socks to avoid any possibility of shrinkage."
2,Piece of Crap,"Mudhoney was one of my favorite bands until this album. After hearing this i just couldn't get into them anymore. ""Every Good Boy Deserves Fudge"" and their Self Titled LP are far far superior releases. I guess when they started making money, they were able to afford better equipement, thus ruining their great sound. a shame."
5,Life changing,I absolutely love this enlightning collection of some of Doreen Virtues books. I have listened to this many times. Awesome! I love the added meditations at the end of each cd.
4,Not for the faint of arousal,"In 27 stories by some of the best known erotica and porn writers of our time, almost every imaginable sexual attraction, scenario, or activity is described. This isn't fiction, however, but accounts of the real lives and interests of these authors (all of whom are much much risque than myself in reallife). Every type of pairing can be found but don't think this is for hets, gays, or bis because the point of the book isn't really arousal (you'll find plenty that turns you both on and off) but to share how sexuality is experienced by real people who in turn create fantasies for the rest of us. I, honestly, did not find myself turned on very much but I found it all very interesting. If you are looking for pages upon pages of arousal, look elsewhere; if you want to see how strange real sex can be, then give this book a try."
3,There's Better Than This,"The Everly Brothers are an institution and are deservedly one of the greatest talents, duo or otherwise, of the last century. It would be such a travesty if the uninitiated judged these wonderful singers based upon this album alone. While there may a few keepers on this album, it's mostly stuff that I wouldn't want to hear more than once. To appreciate the wonderful music of the Everlys, buy the Cadence album."
3,"For Disco enthusiasts, only.","Amazing remastering. Title track is sensational, brings back very good memories from the late 1970's. Other tracks are just fillers, so that's ok."
2,its not what i remembered,i was expecting the long play version of star wars it was far from it the version here was never played in central fl. there is too much here.
2,A diservice to DP,"Sound quality is poor with the band sounding thin. Don't get me wrong, I like Deep Purple, ever since the 70s. DP's music should sound heavy and rich: the DVD sounds thin and radio-like: whether its the acoustics of the venue or the recording process, I cannot tell. The band plays reasonably well, and Steve Morse shines, though again his guitar sounds lighter than usual, thus lessening the impact of his playing. Finally, Ian, the lead singer, was clearly in bad shape. He fails to hit the requiste high notes and ends up sounding like a squeaky mouse. This from the baddest in the 70s...and it ain't just the recording. If you are a Deep Purple fan look for something else or stick with your audio recordings...avoid this one and don't make th mistake of confusing liking their music and purschasing this DVD."
4,Mater's tow hook broke off,"I ordered this toy for my 2 year old son and he loves it. Mater's tow hook broke off not long after we received the toy. My son still plays with it and it does not bother him at all. This is a nice, heavy weight toy that seems quite durable, less the tow hook."
1,A voice that would gag a maggott!,"When the Spice Girls were a foursome and touring, Gifford siezed the moment one morning while on the Regis and KL Show, and blurted out ""You know, I could be a Spice Girl!"" To which Reg quickly added,""Yeah, you could be called Old Spice!""Gifford should just retire. Her recordings and minimal voice talents are simply embarrasing. It's just ironic how she still has a following to this day, and it's just a matter of time before her music surfaces on Jersey City's Incorrect Music Radio Show. She's the female equivalent of Michael Bolton. The harder she tries, the more she exudes fraudulence."
4,"Wonderful ""lost"" Williams and Delerue music","Honestly, the only reason I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars is that these are new recordings rather than the originals, and there are subtle faults in these versions of John Williams' otherwise sublime title themes (which I knew very well from watching the show).""The Mission,"" despite the fact that he isn't conductiong, still comes across as classic Williams music, huge and suspenseful and magical. Actually, some his best work in my opinion.The late Georges Delerue's ""Dorothy and Ben"" score is without a doubt some of the saddest music I've ever heard. And if you've seen this episode of the show it should be twice as moving for you (it's the one about the old man who awakens from a long coma and picks up psychic messages from a little girl who is still in a coma). Great music from a great piece of television.If you like great film music, you'll love this album."
4,Excellent resource from an extraordinary therapist.,"Robin Shipley is one of the most insightful people that I've met on the subject of Autism. I would highly recommend any of her resources for parents, educators or those considering the behavioral support field."
1,Was ripped off!,was sent one disc when advertised as box set....im very disappointed! What kind of service are you running here anyway?
3,He's a greedy bastard and he's okay.,"This was originally published online as a daily diary on a Monty Python site (some of the boring parts have been edited out in the book version). It chronicles Eric Idle's ""Greedy Bastard Tour"" of Canada and America. It is pretty interesting, although a few boring parts were left in. A lot of what Idle writes here is quite funny, as you might expect. But what is somewhat surprising is that at times he gets serious and pours his heart out. The account of his friendship with George Harrison, and how Eric felt when George died, is actually quite touching. I should note that this book is not strictly about the Greedy Bastard Tour. There are many instances when he digresses and writes about events that happened in years past. This book will be of the most interest to Monty Python fans, and they are probably the only ones who will buy it, anyway."
5,My 2 1/2 year old's favorite,"I think the title can be a little jolting, because who wants to teach their children about war. But if you're like me, and your children are exposed to NO television, this book is perfectly fine and a safe way to introduce a disagreement, or as they are calling it, ""battle"". There is nothing too rough about this book, but I also love the Wully-Wully book. I recommend all of the Babar books."
4,great book!,This book was a non-stop read. I read it in two days! Very interesting and well written. I highly recommend this book.Karen
3,Revisiting childhood,"We loved this movie as kids but re-watching it as an adult (having seen much better movies) it leaves much to be desired. There are some pretty sizeable plot holes and the acting overall is kinda cheesy.But, it still brings back childhood memories so for that it gets an average rating."
5,Finally a REAL ROCKER for 2006!,"Lynam hit the nail on the head with this true grit rocker. It's a bit of an 80's hair band revival with a modern approach. These guys are amazing live and every bit as good as they sound in the studio. If you are looking for a good live show... they are the band to see, and if you are looking for a great album... this is the one to buy! It's full of just the right amount of wailing guitar, tight harmonies, and hooks that will stick in your head for days. Get Slave To The Machine... you will not regret it... in fact, I guarantee you will love it!"
3,Ego Problems,"It is great to hear rappers rapping for God, but OGG'z have a serious problem with their egos on this album. On many tracks the focus is more so on their success or their struggles than on God. They have taken a turn for the negative in their music."
5,A Phat Album!!!!,Every track on this album is a stinger. I Bought a few gospel albums at the time. Needless to say three weeks on and they still don't get a look in. Gospel gangstaz is always on my cd player and the others don't even get a look in!!!! Eventually the Knolly brothers will get played because I recognise that this too is a of the scale album.
3,Green Ireland Cap,"The cap broke, however Irish Gifts was more that helpful. Not only did they have great communication, but they also refunded me my original fees, and the shipping i spent to send the hat back. I would definitely recommend them."
2,just working,Apart from the fiddly nature of the charger it does all it says apart from the one main thing if you intend to have it connected to your car whilst driving the charger is not shielded thus a ridiculously loud hum can be heard through the sound system as it charges for the sake of a cheap shielding mechanism to prevent this problem could be easily solved buy at your own peril
5,Wonderful Book,"Having spent many of my early years on the Jersey shore, it was a delight to receive this for my birthday. I was so happy to finally see the shore I remembered from my youth so thoughtfully collected and written about. It truly evokes the memories of the wonderful boardwalks I have from my childhood. A wonderful book."
5,this is a great cd a must have for your collection,prince is one of the bet artist i ever listen to. he combines everyday life into lyrics that i can relate to. the music is relaxing and enjoying.
3,"They keep asking ""Where is the old Prince?"" Right here!","An album that wasn't received as well as his previous release ""Diamonds & Pearls,"" the o)+> album is probably one of Prince's most adventurous efforts. It has the experimental feel of ""Parade"" and ""Sign 'O' The Times"" but with more lavish orchestration and tighter production (however, I still wouldn't rank this album above ""Sign 'O' The Times""). Prince dips his magic hands into reggae, opera, techno, and gospel. He pulls gold from this album. The 2nd track on this album, the infamous ""Sexy M.F."", has got to be the most singular funky song he ever produced. James Brown guitar, punchy horns, back-bottom drums, it is funk perfected and personified in one song. This album is a weird mix, but give it enough time and it will grow on you."
1,Dissapointing experience,"This book is very shallow and i have a hard time seing how it can be ""an analysis"". It offers very little text but around 120 pages of B/W close-up photographs of old SMG's like the sten etc.Save your money for something like Gabe Suarez book ""the tactical shotgun"" for tactics and applications of shotguns."
5,SKETCH BOOK,"OUR TEENAGE SON LOVES TO DRAW CREATURES, DRAGONS, AND MEN. WE HAVE SEVERAL OF THESE BOOKS AND HE LOVES TO DRAW EVEN MORE! THEY GIVE HIM SO MUCH HELP WHEN IT COMES TO DRAWING EACH WEEK. WE LOVE THE BOOK!!"
1,it was picture with indoor/outdoor grill. NOT ONE RECIPE for that.,"I was very disappointed - I ordered this for the Indoor/Outdoor George Foreman grill that it was pictured with - It did not have ONE recipe for that grill. Totally useless, only for indoor two sided grill. Why would you picture with this grill? I want to return in."
2,Meh,"Was not impressed. Did not tell you how long or how to use the grill, it was just generic when it came to the different grills. I did not try the recipes either, they just didn't seem so awesome. It was mostly marinades and sauces."
2,Too Noisy,"These were stiff, too noisy and chattered badly on my 2008 Tundra. Valeo has a much better product, although they are harder to find."
5,"Essential, Valuable Resource Book","Before buying your first book from the campus bookstore, be sure to pick up this valuable reference! This is a well-written, sensible, and easy to follow guide which incidentally helps students become more responsible with credit and money.Universally, I appreciated the fact that it addressed scheduling concerns, leases, as well as aspects of campus social life. As a student entering graduate school, this book will undeniably carryover and prove to be a great resource."
5,The title says plenty,"Earl Hooker might be the most overlooked Chicago blues guy out there. He is for the most part electric, with fuzz wah effects and plays very good slide style. This particular disc is nice because it samples several different albums that he played on."
1,Do you know what a memoir is?,"Call things by their names: This book IS NOT a memoir. It is fiction (and bad fiction). I borrowed this book from public library, and also had to stop in the middle of it. I felt it was a waste of my time... these stupid stories. I also wish I could rate it 0 stars. I've had enough of Chinese melodramas...."
3,"Not Bad, Not Great - Just OK","This book is not a page turner. However, there was just enough there that I wanted to read it to the end. Get some closure, perhaps.I understand some of the criticism directed at this book. There are parts of it where the authors are simply making up events, but at least they outright tell you so; e.g., ""Here is how I imagine my grandmother's suitor."" I didn't find this irritating or annoying. Just awkward, for a biographical piece.I was disappointed that there wasn't more to the ""mystery."" No climactic ending - for better or worse. In the end, this woman who had already left her husband twice, left him one final time because she could not overcome her bitterness and jealousies. She started as a modern Chinese woman full of spirit and energy, but ended up being someone old and spiteful. Someone who would hold a 30-40 year grudge. Someone who would disown her own son. How sad."
1,Buy the regular Nature's Miracle instead,"We (unfortunately) have a good amount of experience with regular Nature's Miracle and the excellent job it does neutralizing the smell of cat pee. So, when we discovered that one of our cats decided to pee on the carpet again, we figured the ""Just for cats"" should be at least as good, if not better, right?Wrong.This stuff is worthless. 2 months after pouring a gallon of this junk on our carpet, it still smells like pee. We are giving up and trying the Rug Doctor pet shampoo before we decided on replacing the entire carpet.I wish I would have stuck to the regular Nature's miracle cause that worked great. Sometimes ""New and improved"" isint."
2,not their best work,"All you have to say is ""Wiggles"" and my 20-month-old daughter runs to the TV. She'd watch Magical Adventure every day if we'd let her. So when this DVD showed up at the store, I thought it would be a nice change.The first thing I noticed is the low production values. The camera operators seem to have difficulty keeping up with the action, and the sets and props look like a school play. All of that wouldn't matter if my daughter enjoyed it, but she lost interest in just a few minutes (something that doesn't happen with the other DVDs).Because the actors look much younger, I'm guessing that this was shot long before the 1999 copyright credits would indicate. If the Wiggles had not become such a marketing bonanza, this one would probably still be sitting on some producer's shelf."
3,mixed,"Product arrived new in package but with incorrect software CD, missing manual (often on software CD), cables and back-plane. The software was available on-line, I had cables but had to fabricate the back-plane from scrap aluminum. The board works just fine and is super fast with just a Pentium D Dual Core, 4 Gig of ram, 2 80GB Intel solid state drives in SATA RAID 0 striped array with another Intel 80GB solid state as secure file storage. I will upgrade to a Core II quad and triple the memory."
3,Russian star,"She's a star in Russia, but it went a bit quiet around her recently. What she does basically is pop music with an ok voice - she doesn't have the strongest voice though...but for what she does it is ok."
5,Great review,"After programming for quite a few years, naturally the topic of terrain rendering came upon me eventually. Before reading this book, I had researched every LOD algorithm covered in the book; however, what makes this book great is the ease at which the algorithms are described, thus making implementation all the more simpler. While covering several tessellation algorithms, the book extends its literature by discussing and providing much sample source code for great effects that many beginners would be lost in understanding of, such as liquid simulation, terrain lighting and texturing, sky domes, etc. Although, the book certainly isn't for the fairly advanced graphics programmers, it's great for an aspiring coder."
2,I didn't want to learn how to make SLOW terrains,"This book teaches just the basics. For more info, you need to get other books. The samples use OpenGL and are useless for real game coding. There are better terrain books available."
4,"Good filter, easy to install, but a tight fit and messy removal on a '97 Grand Marquis","This is a fine run-of-the-mill extended-life oil filter and works as well as any other from a reputable company. We ran it for 5,000 miles on a 1997 Mercury Grand Marquis and it did its job properly. Normally we use the smaller standard-life filter but this was the only one available at a local store in a pinch. The only issue of note in our case is that it's a rather big filter and must be tipped on its side and maneuvered through a tight space during installation and removal. This can be particularly messy during removal if you're not careful. Depending on where and how your filter is mounted this may or may not be an issue."
2,History loses out to fantasy,"Our museum docents book group decided that this book sounded perfect for those interested in history of writing, metal working, development of commerce and arithmetic. Unfortunately the characters put down their stylus or bellows just as another character arrived to chat so Harry Turtledove did not need to describe any of these interesting facets of everyday life in ancient times.Heavy portentious repetitious language weighed down the narrative in an apparent attempt to sound authentic. Cardboard characters moved through the story with no real development and the ending was obvious - man gets girl.Stick to fantasy, Harry."
5,Good Book,"This book triumphantly delves into the common science fiction aspiration of a single idea overcoming tremendous odds. Turtledove's story is a good one, and i recommend it to readers interested in this genre."
2,Bad Ending For This Book,"I believe that Turtledove could have done better to work out a better ending. How about ending with Sharur in the Alashkurri Mountains, with all the Alashkurrut thinking for themselves as the Giblut do. I would have liked to have known if the gods of Alashkurri punished Sharur with their remeining power. This book left alot of questions unanswered."
5,Great practical treatise on grace,"This is the strongest defense I've read on the sovereignty of God in saving and holding those who are redeemed. Kazee's theology is sound, and his presentation makes it clear and plain to all readers. This book really changed my thinking, and set my heart and mind in awe of an incomparable Creator, Redeemer, and Lord."
3,Vineyard Music Fans,"This is a CD that Vineyard Music released in 2006. It is a great CD. The reason that I bought it is because Rita Springer sings ""If You Say Go"". I am a big Rita fan. I think this song is one of her best songs recorded. Their are others from this album that I really like as well. I don't think you will be disapointed by this CD."
5,Enlightening and addictive,Like nothing I've heard before. These women are phenominal. I've listened to this CD over a dozen times.
5,"Insightful, innovative, cutting edge look at giftedness","This book is for all those who want to help children develop to their fullest. It is a remarkable story of the trials and difficulties involved in nurturing two very gifted young people. It is also the story of two kids who were often misdiagnosed, misidentified, misunderstood, and misplaced, and overcame enormous obstacles. Kevin and Cassidy's ability to create sanity in the midst of adversity is a testimony to their creativity and perseverance and is an encouragement to all parents struggling to help their kids overcome obstacles in the system. A fascinating saga still in the making!"
3,still reading it,so i will finish this review when i have finished reading (sorry) p.s. good so far. This is a core text for philosophy of science students at ANU.
2,Sorbitol nausea,"A friend got these for me and unfortunately I couldn't take them long enough to experience any results, as the excessive amount of sorbitol in the tablets gave me a blood sugar and insulin spike and made me bloated, nauseous and thirsty. (Don't believe what they say about sugar alcohols not impacting blood sugar--if you're diabetic or have severe insulin resistance, they'll mess you up.) So an expensive gift that was supposed to help me with serious health problems turned out to just make me worse, which was embarrassing and frustrating. I'll certainly stay away from this brand in the future and look for unsweetened brands, and urge anyone with insulin-related problems to do the same."
4,Excellent Macro,"This is truly an excellent macro lens. I've been able to take 1:1 photos of insects and get excellent sharpness, good colors nice bokeh (learned this from photo forums... ). So image quality from this lens is excellent. I'm also happy with it as an all around lens - portraits, landscape (stitched).That said, there are some minor nitpicks :Plastic build - not a big issue as it helps with weight, but still - plastic IS plastic. Feel is different.Focusing - you have to employ good techniques (i.e. tripod), otherwise you'll end up with lens hunting a lot since the focus area moves if it is handheld and you miss your subject. The focus lock does help.Focus speed I think can be improved - it's fast, but wouldn't hurt to be fastER.Short working distance - I can use a bit more, but looks like this will be a job for a 180mm macro.Overall, with good technique this is a great lens."
1,"Sony's first posthumous KoRn ""Cash-In""","First off, you have to understand that KoRn does not, as a group, endorse this release... nor did they choose what material would be on this ""Live and Rare"" album. You see, upon leaving Epic/Immortal for the Virgin label, KoRn lost all rights to EVERYTHING they recorded/produced under Sony's label. Therefore, Sony now has all control and can release JUNKY COMPILATIONS like this whenever/however they want now. The songs are excellent, DO NOT take this review as me bashing KoRn... I am criticizing Sony for releasing these readily available tunes for a quick buck. Nothing is ""Rare"" about this album. I cannot wait for the day Sony has to sell off the KoRn catalouge... Hopefully, KoRn and Virgin will be ready to deal the highest bid!"
2,"Meh ... not bad, but not great","So this is what happens when your former record label wants to cash in on your popularity, even after you've left ...Have to say that this disc, while not bad, still leaves a lot to be desired. It's a very underwhelming first listening and while it does grow on you, it's not a disc that you're dying to listen to again.For me, the three-part ""Another Brick in the Wall"" is great, but doesn't hold up to repeated plays.That being said, the band's performance of ""One"" is a nice addition ... just wish they did a more complete version of the song.My biggest complaint about the disc is the mix overall. The performance at CBGBs in NYC is a poor live recording, folks. The vocals are way down in the mix and the bass is all over the place, virtually on top of everything else. No excuse with the recording technology available these days.Nice try Epic, but this one just ultimately falls flat."
2,Rare? Huh?,"This album shouldn't have been made. Not because of the music, but because it was put out by Korn's former label, Epic, obviously trying to get paid as Korn promotes 'See You on the Other Side.' This is a suit's album, plain and simple. As of the release date (May 9, 2006), Korn hasn't even mentioned it on their website!On to the album itself... there is nothing rare here. It's basically their greatest hits - live. Many Korn fans might even have tracks that are on this album. The live version of Metallica's 'One' is here - the same 'hidden' track on 'Take a Look in the Mirror.'However, that doesn't make it bad... It's fun to listen to, and it's always a bonus when you can hear the crowd singing along, especially the chorus. But still, this shouldn't have been made at all. Had Jonathan Davis been involved, I'm sure it would've been better."
1,Where's the research?,Where's the research? A lot of generalities and informationthat has been tossed around by everyone. Not much substance here!
1,"Review for book ""Change Your World""",I ordered this book over a month ago and have not received it. I sent the vendor an email two weeks ago with no reply. I would not recommend ordering from this vendor in the future.
5,found this is the discount bin,"about a year after it came out. Lucky for me , cause this is probably one of my top 5 thrash albums ever. This band had great Riffs. the vocals are a bit hit and miss, but its kinda what gives this album its charm. The production is not too slick as was so much of the mid 90's thrash . Has a very old school sensibility to it, like it couldve come out in the 80's when the thrash was much more ferocious. for a couple of bucks on amazon, its soooooo worth a purchase. Its one of those albums where u can tell your mates, ""you should check out these guys"" as ive done. Still must get their 1st album... KNOCK IT BACK"
5,Pretty accurate and nice,"Does the job quick and easy. used this for bullion, coins and jewelry, it works nice and is quite accurate."
4,A little small but a great deal for the price!,"I really like this scale for weighing small packages though I wish the scale part were just a little longer. From a cooking perspective, I think this is a pretty ideal size."
3,I haven't used it yet!,Why do they keep bugging me to rate this stuff? Imagine if the food store did this to you for every item or can of dog food you bought!
2,You get what you pay for,"This scale, while convenient, is not very easy to program, nor is it very accurate. If you need your measurements to be spot on, this is probably not the best investment. If estimates are ok, then this will work. But no one buys a scale for estimates.We use this scale to measure precious metals and gems. You have to be exact in order to know what to pay/charge. Weighing the same piece several times in a row yields a different weight every time. We've calibrated it. We've properly tarried it. It just seems to be off somehow."
2,Terribly inaccurate at low weights,"This scale is completely useless to me. Even with putting as much as 4/10th of a gram on the scale, it completely failed to register any weight. A complete waste of money"
5,Great Camera,"This is my very first digital camera however I did much research and homework before buying to get the most for my money. Aside from the fact that it got great reviews, I have to honestly say this camera takes fantastic photos and is easy to use especially for a dummy like me. A few minor quirks. Lens cap will not stay on and easy to get lost. 8meg smartcard comes with the camera and is a total waste of time. I would recommend no less that 32megs and I bought a 64 and it will hold 84 photos in the HQ mode. The LED viewer on the back of the camera has no cover and can be stratched quite easily. However, these minor flaws aside, I have been very pleased the ease and the quality this camera has given me. I recommend it if you got the 6 bills to put out for it."
4,Good practice gi.,"Overall, I am very pleased with this gi. It is a great beginner gi and a good practice gi for more seasoned grapplers. So far, it has held up very nicely. The only negatives that I have to point out are that the cuffs are not tapered very well so theres a lot of extra material to be grabbed and the collar is thin and not very rigid. These are not really that bad if you use it for general training. This is definitely NOT a competition gi."
5,I am happy,"Hi folk,I want only to say that this uniform is perfect. Very good quality, very resistent. if i have to buy another one I will try to get the same brand!"
2,early greece,"this book is held in high honors by historians, but in contempt by archaeologists - and for good reason. if you want to understand a period of human history from which the literary evidence is virtually non-existent, you must incorporate other sources of evidence in your treaty. murray does not, and his vision of archaic greece is thus vastly different to the view of robin osbourne, whose ""greece in the making"" is a much better treatment of the archaic period than this. oswyn murray, although a vastly skilled historian and a wonderful scholar, just does not get it right.if you have no idea of what is going on during the 7th and 6th centuries BC and have this book at hand, by all means read it - but please keep in mind that there are much better treatments of the period available."
4,A Great Insight into the Press Covering Hillary,"I didn't see this book as one that would give me great insight into Hillary Clinton. (I honestly don't think that book exists.) To some extent, it did explain how she won her first Senate race in NY-- by working harder than anyone else in the race, by taking the time to learn what the people of NY cared about and then talking to them about those things.More importantly, what the book did impart (intentionally, or not) was a valuable look at the press covering Hillary Clinton and why and how they cover her (and other candidates) the way they do. In fact, I think the book is important reading for anyone who wants to understand the dynamics of the press corps in a campaign-- who the press likes, who the press hates, and why."
5,this book has impacted my life,"the Bible is filled with hard-hitting truth, but most of the time i choose to overlook, forget, or explain it away. this book brings them out front, points to them and says, ""do it!"" the call of Christ to discipleship is not easy, but it's the best life to live. i can't say that i've read every book there is on discipleship, there may be other good or better books, but God has used this one in my own life, and that's what i can tell u. i recall one chapter that says the church today is far from zealous; communists in the world today are more zealous for their cause than Christians are for Christ, this is a serious indictment. one line that will stick in my mind for some time is ""faith that costs nothing is worth nothing."" God desires our suffering and trials to produce a faith refined by fire, proven true with testing (1 peter 1:7). this book has challenged me tremendously, i would recommend this to anyone who wants to get out of complacency and apathy."
2,Not impressed,"It seems the subject matter should be for elementary age but the way it is presented is for preschool, would not have bought, another on B Franklin is out there much better. Richard Rich illustrated classics, see if you find it at the library or elsewhere, amazon doesn't seem to carry it"
1,Boring,"I loved Maria in The Woman in White. I enjoy the Original London Cast CD of this show, but Maria as a solo artist is simply boring, I wish I've never gotten this CD and had saved my money, I forced myself to listen to this CD about 10 times, and it is just plain and boring. Love the girl, hate the CD. Maria is a beauty and a great talented lady of the theatre and film, and can't wait to see her in a show again, personally, I enjoy her when she works with Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber a lot more."
3,not your run of the mill cookbook,"This is one of Alice Waters' early books, and it shows, as compared to the later ones. Many of the recipes are complicated, and involve ingredients that are not easy to come by, even in NYC. I read it more for amusement. The later books (Vegetables, Fruit, Cafe), are much more user friendly and result in great dishes. I wouldn't recommend this to someone new to her philosophy of cooking, or who doesn't have serious kitchen experience."
4,There is something about images that awaken the intuition,"I like to use these cards when I want to work on intuitive reading, because all it is is an image and it is up to you to ""see"" what it means. They do have a little booklet that comes with it, but I prefer to try to be empathic in my reading, unless the card with the dog laying under the tree comes up and I was asking about something that doesn't match that lol."
2,GungHo,Kinda of old stuff easily seen online..really didnt do anything to inspire me into drawing something new..pretty old weapons systems and up to date..waste of money if your looking for new ideas..best part of the book was the cover
1,"""Radio"" Only Good Song on Here","I have to agree with the other reviewer here who said that ""I Watched It All on the Radio"" was the only good song on here. Its too bad because I really like Cartwright's voice and with great material, he certainly was good.This CD just fell flat and none of the other tunes were memorable. For the premier ""Lionel Cartwright"" CD I'd recommend ""Chasin' the Sun"". That one was his masterpiece."
4,"Works well, easy install","Product shipped timely, was easy to install, and seems to work well. The only problem is that it goes to high in my opinion. If it stopped at a 100 or so, then it would be much easier to see how fast you're going when you glance down. I'm using on an XR400R, so I don't need to see any speed over 75 really."
4,Door lock units,I installed these in my daughters car prior to installing an alarm. It includes all the hardware to mount and connect to the existing mechanisims that lock and unlock your doors. They look like they could replace worn or defective original equipmetn locks as well. The included wiring is adequate for a mid-size vehicle. The units for the front doors have extra wiring for the switches normaly found in todays cars. The instructions that come with the units seem like an after thought and look like you have to adapt them to fit your car. There is no mention of or suggestion for utilising the four strips of metal that might be mounting brackets. I also had a problem with the ground for the control relay being back-fed through the solenoid. Cutting off the black ground wire to the front door units and leaving the wire to just the relay unit solved the problem. Other wise the solenoids sound strong and capable.
4,"Easy to install, a little noisy","It is a good product for the cost, good quality of their components and easy to install. I recommend it. It comes with their wires and central command, it could be connected with the alarm."
4,Stevie's Tricycle,I am happy with all aspects of the purchase. The item was as described and delivery time was fast.
5,Tara; the Female Buddha,"I am a collector of fine statues of Buddhas, Ganesh, etc. and when I received the Tara Box; I fell in love w/ it. The statue was intricate and beautiful. She is the female counterpart of the male Buddha, and she is so compassionate and protective. I have her in my bedroom. The box makes a neat little altar to protect the statue. The book has a brief history of her life and blessings.I would definitely recommend Tara for your collection of Eastern Art and Culture and also just for the beauty and true compassion emanating from the statue."
5,This is rock.,"Simply put, this is the best rock and roll CD in my collection of well over 300 CDs. A little bit of pop, a little bit of punk, a little bit of metal, and a lot of Replacements influence, SSC is amazing from start to finish. ""Fallin' Down"" has a killer riff, and ""We Are The Normal"" (co-written with one of the Replacements, incedentally) is almost as good as ""Iris,"" my personal favorite GGD track. The lyrics, as always, are amazing and profound, and anyone who likes Robby Takac's voice will like this, for his voice is at its very best here. The only place it sounds better is on ""Slave Girl"" from A Boy Named Goo (another killer album). If you like rock music with soul and energy, pick this up."
5,Phenomenal read!,"This is Michener at his best and a perfect travel guide for the islands for a history buff. The historical novel is as informative as it is entertaining and emotional. At times, I wanted to wack Abner Hale, the New England missionary assigned to convert the 'heathens'(I hate this term but it is effective in conveying the self righteous of Hale.), across the face for his obstinate and myopic beliefs and behavior. The background and development of the Hawaiian culture and religion is as good as any anthropological or sociological study I've read.Be prepared. The book is long and exhaustive. I haven't finished it but will, even though it will be less pleasant reading it in cold, snowy Chicago than sub tropical Hawaii."
5,"Origins of New Mexico Families, by Fr. Angelico Chavez","This book stands out in genealogical research for the commom person who is just beginning to do research. Although, I found that there were some errors after doing more detailed research, it certainly gave me enough information to lead me to documents that corrected them for me. I highly recommend this book to all New Mexicans who have lines to the early colonists of New Mexico. I am happy to say that it contained much information about my ancestry. I recommended this to all my NM cousins whowere doing their own research into New Mexico settlers and I certainly thank Fr. Chavez for doing most of my research for me."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM,Do no buy this item. It is a very beautiful peice but it is made out of particle board. The weight of the drawers was not even supported by the dresser. The particle board kept coming apart and we had to send this item back. I would recommend the davinci collection if you are looking for a great piece of nursery furniture. DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. IT WAS THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THAT I HAVE EVER MADE. IT WILL ONLY CAUSE YOU FRUSTRATION BECAUSE THERE IS NO WAY YOU WOULD EVER PLACE YOUR CHILD ON THIS PIECE OF FURNITURE NOR WOULD YOU HAVE THIS IN A NURSERY BECAUSE IT WILL LITERALLY FALL APART AT ANY MOMENT.
2,Surface color comes right off.,"We found this dresser to be very nice looking and easy to put together. The only problem I have with it is that it's ""painted"" an oak color and less than 10 minutes after we had it together it was scratched. Everytime I touch it the oak colored surface rubs right off. The child isn't even born yet and it already looks used. For a dresser that's going to be in a childs room and that I don't consider cheap, I am very disappointed."
2,A Nightmare to put together!!!,"I loved the look of this dresser, but that's where the love ends. It was an absolute nightmare to put together (took 4 hours). The directions were wrong on several occassions! Luckily we were able to figure that out and basically had to put the whole thing together without the directions! The piece looks nice now that it's together but the drawers are shallow and don't open and close smoothly. We also can't get the door to align right so it's slightly crooked. I'm pretty disappointed with this piece."
1,poor quality craftmanship,"It was a cheaper than other units, but can tell in the quality. The pieces fit very poorly and every month, the drawer screws comes loose and literally falls apart! So once a month, i have to assemble the drawer again. As soon as my son no longer needs it for changing diapers, will be throwing it in the trash."
1,CHEAP P.O.S.,"I am very disappointed in the purchase of this product. I bought the 4 in 1 transitional crib and was very satisified-it was of good quality; cannot say the same about this cheap piece of XXXX. It is made out of partical board and I am embarassed to have this in our nursery.The product arrived damaged...not from shipping but with major flaws from the manufacturer with the finish being scratched and dented. There was also defects in manufacturing where I had to drill holes for the assembly.Bottom line- !!!!!!DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!!!!!! I would return if shipping was not so expensive, could find a quality matching piece and I had time to replace it. This looks like it would be clearanced at Odd Lots/Big Lots but instead...they sold it cheaply on the internet to unsuspecting consumers."
3,Cheap wood but sturdy drawers,"Pros : nice price for a piece that will be used for a couple of yearsSturdy drawers and no wobble once it's together, feels very sturdyPerfect size for a smaller room and matches our crib perfectlyFacing wood is nice and solidCons: the wood that is used to support the drawers and backing is cheap, plywoodScrewing in the backing split some of the support wood which can be seen inside the cabinetsThe instructions...absolutely terrible. I am a handy man and figured it out easily but not a single word just picturesOverall we are happy just wish the wood was a tad thicker but once it's together it looks good"
4,Awesome and big for its price,"I love the final product, It was really hard to put together, once we figured out the way the manual was set up, it became easier, it was still a lot of work, but I think it was worth it"
4,good for the price,"Hi, my husband and I buy this for are baby's nursery.Is beautiful and easy to put together(I had to help my husband with the reading of the instructions, but it was easy)It looks great and it match the color of the crib. I do recommend this product."
3,Eh.,"The instructions are decent, not great. Took a good 3+ hours for 2 people to assemble. Everything worked out after a few ""WTF this doesn't look like the instructions! oh, wait, it's upside down"" moments that could have been fixed with better directions/craftsmanship. The real pain in the ass was putting the back on. Screwing 34 tiny screws through particle board into particle board. It doesn't line up. They don't go in straight. And now I have to probably get some of those tiny little nails to fix it. You could do worse, but you could also do a lot better. I think next time I'll try a different product."
1,Disappointed,"This product came in two different colors! After we unpacked the entire box, we noticed there were two different colors of wood. We were pretty annoyed at this but Amazon was great at taking the dresser back with no hassle."
4,Stork Cherry dresser,Beautiful Changing table/dresser with plenty of storage. Very good quality. Only thing reason is 4 stars and not 5 is because it took my husband a long time to put it together. About 3-4 hours. He puts things together all the time and this one took him longer than usual. He said it was confusing and hard to put together.
4,Nice dresser but instructions are terrible,"This dresser/changer is much nicer than it looks in the picture. It's pretty true to color, unlike the bed that matches it which looks much darker online. When put together, it's a good quality, sturdy, and looks really good.However, the instructions to assemble it are just terrible. There are many pieces that are not labeled and only pictures that are not very clear for the instructions. It took much longer than it should have to assemble."
3,Bring your own...,"Yeah, your going to need some nuts and stuff to help out and make sure you've got an extra hand... Drill holes are drilled crocked, parts don't match up. I've bought cheap stuff from Wal-mart that fit together better than this. The top shelf was dented and scratched and you could see the glue squiggle pattern down the center of the it where they applied the veneer. Items in the instruction didn't match up to actual parts. I'd give it a 4 stars in looks but knowing that it's a bit rattly I gave it a three almost a 2 because the bolts for the dresser knobs were drilled to large for the provided screws...The Luckily I had some others that worked as they should have. Matching crib is AWESOME though. Put it together in half the time."
1,Unreliable junk.,"Having used several drill bits over the course of my 30-year carpentry career, I consider myself a good judge of which drill bits will do the job and which will fail. Upon first examination, the bits felt sharp but extremely brittle, usually the first sign of inferior metal. Sure enough, while using the 1/8"" bit to run a pilot hole in a sheet metal framing stud, the bit snapped. Even though I received these as a free promotional gift, they will only be used as a backup and only in wood. The case is nice but a bit oversized for my professional toolbox, where space is at a premium."
2,"Great product, too expensive","Charmin is what Charmin is, if you like soft toilet paper it's great. However, the cost to buy it online from Amazon was ridiculously expensive. I had somehow thought I was getting more than it was and it was going to be cost effective. The reality is that I could have gotten the same amount at the local supermarket for less, and the same amount for significantly less at Costco or Target."
4,Whispers . . .,"I found Whispers to be a wonderfully written book. This book shows that it's not the stereotypical poor women with drunk husbands who beat them. The couple in this book, the Fegusons, are a wealthy couple who are admired by many in their community. The husband, Robert is a possessive man who blames his wife for things that are out of her control. He expects Lynn to live by his rules. In this book it is evident that the children are affected by his cruelty as much as Lynn is. There are a few twists and turns in this book that keep it interesting. You are on the edge of your seat waiting for the next rampage to occur just to see if she will finally leave him. The ending is very interesting and suspenseful. A wonderful read!"
4,Whispers,This is the first book I've read by this author. I found it to be real world. The characters were very real and it addressed what is happening in a lot of homes across America. I look forward to reading more of her books.
2,Not a text for a rigorous mathematics course,"This book is not to be used as a rigorous introduction to differential geometry. There are some definitions and theorems that are casually described, and the motive behind particular definitions are vague. Those not interested in MAPLE might find constant instructions for MAPLE annoying. Not to be completely negative, there are some good excercizes in the text that I especially enjoyed."
1,Could have been musch better,"Ok this could have been a good movie if they had skipped the gore, swearing, and nudity and wrote a good story. They really could have skipped the f bomb and the nudey scenes were not needed. They needed to take a page out of the originals book it would have been much better. The only good scene in the movies was in the credits."
1,wheres the comedy?,"the original Lost boys was a tongue in cheek horror movie that was quirky , intelligent, and gave as many laughs as it did frights. surely anybody attempting a sequel would build on the formula that made the orginal a world wide hit?Sadly , despite the occasional nice touch ,the lost boys :the tribe plays it straight and dull with little to lighten the mood, from the first very nasty pre-credits death to the intriguing but largley meaningless tag scene featuring Corey Haim , this film is a flat dull slog. its great to see Edgar Frog back in action but you just wish he was in a better Film and with his MIA brother Alan Frog along for the ride."
3,Long overdue sequel!,"This movie is nowhere as good as the first, BUT I am so glad they finally decided to make this. Lost Boys deserved a sequel more than any other movie I can think of. Now the movie wasn't all that good, but it want all that bad either. If it wasn't for this one they wouldn't have made number 3 which I thought was better than number 2 and they really listened to the fans and made a decent movie."
4,"Good, but not great","I liked the movie overall. It didn't have the same FEEL like the first one did, and i wish the characters were more tied together to those in the first (only recurring character is one of the Frogg Brothers.) Definitely keeping it and watching it again."
2,Only for die hard Lost Boys fans,"Buy this, if you're a die hard fan of Lost Boys. Otherwise, not worth the purchase. So-so acting, lousy plot. Could have significantly improved, had it been a solid continuation of the original (e.g. include Corey Haim, Jason Patric, etc)."
1,not a deserving sequel,"this movie is nothing like the first. just from the first five minutes you will realize how bad this movie is. I am a huge fan of the first, its a great movie just all around. this is poorly a lost boys film."
1,Rubbish,"I didn't want to give it one star. This movie is a total stinker. I loved the original. It's just a shame to ruin the memory of it with this garbage. Next time, just don't bother...."
2,Atrocity,"I thought this movie would suck when it came out and boy was I right.The characters are awful.I hate how the vampires looked and acted in this movie.The lead vampire was so lame.He wasn't scary or cool.I didn't care for the brother or sister.This movie tried to appeal to much to teenagers.Vampire surfers,vampires riding skateboards,are you kidding me?!The sex and gore were over the top.The only good thing about this movie was that Corey Feldman was in it.I heard that there will be a Lost Boys 3.Let's hope that it's better than this atrocity."
4,Lost boys: the tribe (uncut version),If you don't like blood sex or violences in your movies. this movie is not for you. If you do I hope you enjoy it.
1,Low Budget Junk!,My all time favorite genre is vampire movies.This B movie was nothing more than a thrown together mish-mosh just to give Angus Sutherland some face time on the big screen.The acting was ridiculous. The effects were amature. The story was just plain boring.Comparing this to the original Lost Boys is like comparing Bram Stoker's Dracula to Kung Fu Vampire.Don't waste your money on this garbage.
4,The best of Dire Straits.. with a spin on the side.,"The On the night CD contains pretty much the best of Dire Straits but the live performance adds a spin. What's here is the Dire Straits classics but as they are performed on the night. It's a straight off recording of some of the best tracks of the ""On every street"" Tour from 1993 and the songs are performed pretty much as on other LP's but are led in with long intro's and finished off with some of the best of the Dire Straits skill. S The fifth track Private investigations has an especcially dark and soulful addition and some would say it's worth it just for that."
5,Constant Rotation!,"We've listened to this CD almost every day since buying it six weeks ago. While parts show its age (the ""Russians are Red"" line stands out), it's a great CD that we all happily listen to, along with favorites like Dan Zanes, Laurie Berkner, Justin Roberts and Elizabeth Mitchell."
4,Weathermatic is a great underwater camera!,I bought this camera to take with me on a 'whale encounter' vacation- where I was able to get in the water (snorkeling) with Humpback whales. The underwater shots that came from the Minolta camera were unbelievable. It captured the beauty of whales so well! I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys snorkeling or shallow water scuba diving. The zoom feature as well as the option of changing the print size were easy to operate underwater. It was small enough not to interfere in swimming or manuevering underwater. It also comes in handy on those rainy days! One weakness was the wrist cord/strap- there wasn't a way to secure it close to my wrist (so it wouldn't fall to the bottom of the ocean!)
2,Film Compartment Problem,"Used camera kayaking and boating with no problems for about two years. Last month, after exposing another roll and getting home, I could not open the film compartment to get the film out. Took camera to local camera store;they could not open the film compartment either, and told me this was not the first time they had seen this problem. I am not sure if this is a defect or just a random occurence. I also found the Minolta USA web site to be useless. They certainly do not seem to encourage customer feedback. Having used AMEX to purchase the camera, the warranty period was still valid and AMEX refunded my purchase cost. Their repair facility was also unable to open the film compartment! At this point I am not sure if I will buy another Weathermatic or not."
3,George Michael & Prince produced tracks,"from eBay seller rootbeersquishie13...""This album was made by Andros Georgiou's Hardback Recording Company. George Michael produced 1 track (""Brother Louie"") and Prince produced 2 tracks (""Get Blue""and ""Dance Unto The Rhythm"") even though they aren't credited. Regular GM stalwarts Chris Porter, Deon Estus, Chris Cameron all feature on the album."""
5,must read,"Another of Parenti's amazing books, shocking in the exposure of the American government. Parenti creates a highly accessible read and a fascinating one."
5,Just Plain Different.,"I personally loved this album. As far as comparing it to the Crue, it's not better, it's not worse, it's just plain different. This album is not as dark as the Crue albums, actually it's more of a ""good times"" and ""partying"" type album. I don't think there's a bad song on it. Well worth owning."
2,NOT a Strategy Guide...,"In bold letters across the top of this book it reads, ""Prima's Official Strategy Guide"". This book is far from it.Inside you will find mostly a reprint of the online help, some reference material for beginners, and some nice pictures.What you won't find are tips and tricks to help you 'beat the game'. Basically, any such exploits are are typically discovered and patched in a very timely manner.This is however a very good book for those who are new to MMORPGs or who are new to (maybe one or two people) the Star Wars universe.I would have been much happier with this book if I paid $$$$ rather than $$$$"
3,gold sequined shoes,"Beautiful shoes, but at the end of the night feet hurt. Very slippery on bottom due plastic heel."
2,Bad choice of words,"I guess I'm glad some ""sissies"" are loud and proud, but I have a problem with calling anyone a sissy. The book is amusing enough, but it leads to terrible stereotyping if children really take its message to heart. Basically, it says not only that it's okay to be gay (and I'm sure it is, because the media keeps telling me so), but then here's how you identify the gay people in your own neighborhood - boys who don't play sports well (or don't play at all), boys who dress up in mommy's clothing (as if mommy dresses in just frilly stuff these days), boys who like to cook (we would have starved in college if we hadn't figured out how to cook), et cetera et cetera. Oh, I get it - we're all sissies! Is that any way to treat your prospective customers, calling them sissies??? I think not. Quit calling me names, big-nose."
5,A Must Read!,"Fantastic book! Purchased this book to expand the amount of LGBTQ literature in my classroom, provides a positive message for all students to be true to themselves!"
4,The little duckling who could...,"This book is not just for kids, or [different] people. Harvey Firestein has written a book about being different, and learning to love and accept those who are different from us.The pictures are quite bright and cheerful, and as usual Mr. Firestein shows pride in all of the characters in his story. Especially keep an eye on Elmer and his mama.Publishers Weekly was right...this book handles its characters and the subject matter with aplomb!"
4,Hollywood Hot Tubs 2,"One Of My Favorites!! Love Jewel Shepard ! Funny and Spirited.One must like this genre' to appreciate it. If you like jewel, you'll love Hot Tubs 2!"
2,Shoulda stopped with the original Hollywood HotTubs movie.,"Tis is the sequel to the original movie 'Hollywood Hot Tubs'. Quite frankly it kinda sucked. Who ever made this should have stopped with the original. I definanlty would not recomend getting this. DON""T BUY IT!!!!! Again, not recomended for minors."
1,"Is this really Spirit, the great jazz-rock fusion band from L.A.?",This sure doesn't sound anywhere close the the great jazz-rock fusion band from the late sixties and early seventies! Buyer beware!
1,Amazon needs to differentiate different bands with same name,"This is definitely not the great fusion band! I got an email from Amazon directing me to this because I had bought albums by the original Spirit, and was bemused to hear a cappella covers of schmaltz warhorses like ""wish upon a star"" emanating from the putative lips and fingers of Randy California, Ed Cassidy et al. I suppose there is no law against a band ""reusing"" a name, but the computer geniuses at Amazon need a way to cope with that situation."
1,Unsupported claims and misinterpretations of data,"I agree whole-heartedly with the other readers who gave this book a very negative rating. As a clinical psychologist and mother of two boys, I was very interested in reading this book but found that early on already, Gurian makes claims that are not supported by any empirical evidence, and even misinterprets findings from the psychological literature. The former would be excusable if he clearly stated that this was only his own view, not a well-established fact. However, there is no excuse for the latter, and it makes me wonder about the effort Gurian put into his background research (if any!). As if to add insult to injury, the book is also poorly written and disorganized. I had a very hard time reading even half of it before I threw it away, disgusted. Parents, don't waste your money on this one. A much better book on the same topic is ""The courage to raise good men."""
1,Alarming Reductionism,"In sociology, there is a term that fits this book to a tee: reductionism. The author, in near-fascist glee at times, tries to convince us that ""boys will be boys"" by virtue of their biology, and that we should just accept that they are different, even superior, to their female counterparts.I found it hard not to close this book time and time again with the blatant misogynistic overtones, but I'm afraid I had to read it till the end to believe he was serious -- he is.Many of the studies he cites in the book have been challenged by behavioral psychologists, and sociologists all along have pointed out that you cannot reduce issues of social causation to a mish-mash of biological excuses. Non-biological social factors contribute much more significantly to boys' behavior than Mr. Gurian would like us to believe."
5,"Excellent, Pragmatic Balance of Competing Views","Gurian does a great job of giving practical advice that is devoid of political motives. In fact, he does an excellent job of demonstrating how much of what passes for ""parenting advice"" is really political ideology. He blasts both liberal and conservative extremes and shows a viable, reasoned alternative. He's really only interested in helping parents raise their boys to become well-adjusted men, not in pushing a social agenda. If you're a ""card carrying member of the ACLU"" or a ""member of the Christian Coalition"", then don't buy this book. If you're willing to be open-minded, please do."
1,"Gurian seems to have mom issues. Get ""Real Boys"" instead.","This man seems to blame a lot on women. I think that his neurological facts were interesting but once he got into thoeries he just made me angry. I'm married, but I feel bad for any single mom who reads this. ""Real Boys"" by Pollack is a much nicer read."
1,This is a very dangerous book.,"In The Wonder of Boys, Gurian begins with biological ""facts"" and launches off into agenda-driven, obervation-based opinion. His mix of observation and facts in the first few chapters especially is very effective for convincing readers of his perspective; most readers will not read critically enough, nor be informed enough, to notice when he makes gross assumptions about brain development, for instance, or posits a common boy behavior as biologically based when socialization plays, I and many others would argue, the definitive role. He refers to cultural and anthropological ""trends"" only when they serve his argument, not citing cultures where those same ""boy"" traits are manifested very differently than in our culture."
1,Research is laking and gay lifestyle is okay?,"As the father of 4 boys, I'm always looking for books that help with insight into raising strong men. Although this book has information and research, I find much of it anecdotal and question the methodology and sample sizes. I also do not agree nor like the authors assertions that because society has grown more accepting of the gay lifestyle that this is okay for children and a natural environment for them to thrive. The entire premise behind this book is that boys are different than girls. I agree. Which also leads for me, how kids need a mom and a dad. We provide different support, discipline, approaches. Again, being one who's raising 4 boys, I see a huge difference in how my boys of various ages respond to my wife and myself. Our goals are the same, our approaches of often different. I will be returning this book and would recommend Bringing Up Boys, also found on Amazon as a good book for this type of subject."
4,Realistic view of boyhood with tough solutions.,"As I read this book I knew many women would have a tough time with this straight discussion about boys and men. I also knew that many men would immediately see themselves and their sons and know right away that this author was making incredible sense. More importantly, the solutions of strong male role models, mentors, healthy discipline and a commitment to teaching boys moral and social value on their terms is ""right on""."
1,Didn't work for my application,"Regrettably, this splitter cable did NOT work with my combination of Video Card (NVidia Quadro CX) and monitors (Dell 24"" and Hyundai 24"" 3D Monitor). Resorted to purchasing an active distribution splitter."
1,Dosen't work,Don't buy it!! It Su_ks.It is so bad The web site is making it difficult to write this review
2,disappointing,I was more than a little disappointed with this book. After a couple of hundred pages it finaly started to talk about how to write the code. The author presents a nice style as he injects a little humour to the task but there realy isn't enough actual programming and gaps at a basic level in what there is. The book is very basic literally for dummies.
2,Not too bad but could be better,"I read this books thinking I was going to learn VB5 programming. I was wrong. It didnt show me that much. It just showed me the very basics, it didn't go beyond that. A lot of the humor the author used was stupid and silly and it was often repeated way too many times. Some of the questions for the quizzes and tests were very stupid or better yet too easy so you could just pick what seems right and it wouldn't teach you anything if it's easy. This book along with other VB5 for Windows books taught me the bare basics so I could go on and read other stuff about VB5. After you read these books, you might want to take a look into VB5 From the Ground Up, VB5 in 21 Days, and Mastering VB5 ( excellent reference)."
5,Attention portrait painters!,"This video will be a boon for portrait artists. Viewing this DVD gave me unique insight about the anatomy of the head. It starts with the bones of the skull then highlights each muscle, describing its purpose and how this affects appearance of the head. Also valuable were those sections on proportions, gender and age differences, and facial expressions. This is a topic rarely handled in anatomy with such detail and clarity. I would strongly recommend it to artists and art students alike."
4,minolta camera lens,exactly what I was looking for and a great buyMinolta 35-70mm 3.5-4.8 MD Zoom SLR Camera Lens
4,Surprising,"I admit that like a lot of people who have heard of this book, I believed it to be merely a manifested work of a demented mind. After I read the book I was shocked by the aethestic and scientific quality of the work. Szuzkalski was extremely dedicated to his anthropological work and it shows throughout this book. Whether or not you believe in Zermatism is constantly tested througout your reading, even if it doesn't make you a believer it will definitely open your mind."
2,Unless it's really your thing...,"I recommend this to someone who's coming to Belly from Throwing Muses etc. and not from following Kim Deal from the Pixies to Breeders connections (like me). I bought this on impulse, having heard ""Feed the Trees"" and ""Someone to Die For"" (both excellent tracks on here!) but the rest of the CD disappoints. The guitar sounds cheesy after listening to the same (don't know musical terms) style over and over again. Just a little too produced and smooth."
4,Strawberries and razor blades...,"Tanya Donnelly's best album (regardless of who she worked with) is this bright-eyed, big-hearted pop-rocker. Star perfectly balances the moody and ethereal (Every Word, Someone To Die For) with the all-out driving classics (Slow Dog, Feed The Tree) and throws in an ill-judged but compulsive ballad (Untogether) for good measure. A must-have album."
4,one of my favorite cds,"this is belly's first cd, but not their best. it's kinda choppy, and tanya's lyrics are hard to understand. they're very cryptic. but, i do love this cd, i've had it since i was in jr. high school and i still listen to it at least once a week. i have most of belly's cds, i still need some imports, and any of tanya's solo stuff i could find. if you like this, try some of juliana hatfield's music. hope you like the cd..."
5,Belongs In Everyone's Collection,"Star is such an incredible cd. The songs are so various, you go from such a soft,soothing song like Witch and then go to a fast paced rock anthem like Slow Dog.. Tanya's vocals are haunting. Lyrics are thought provoking and deep. A very talented, well done cd."
3,Consider revisiting,"""Feed the Tree"" was a smash of sorts in 1993, and it remains a great single, a true indie hit to rank with (almost) The Smashing Pumpkins ""1979"" in terms of pure catchiness. A lot of the rest of this album is pedestrian, and after the stong opener ""Someone to Die For"" the next three songs, 13 years later, sound dated and absolutely disposible. But the record manages a couple other genuine highlights, including the oddly seductive ""Slow Dog,"" ""Gepetto"" and the elegaic closer ""Stay."" Not a great album, but holds up better than anyone in 1993 could have imagined."
4,What ever happened to Belly?,"It is strange to see that people are still listening and enjoying this album today. it's been 12 years since this album was released and I took it out of storage just a few days ago. hadn't heard it in years and I realized how much I enjoyed it. It is very simple, strait forward pop rock music, but Tanya's voice and poetic lyrics really made this album special. I remember seeing Belly in a small venue back in late '93. It was a great show. Their opening band was none other than Radiohead. Who knew Radiohead would become such a huge band. I still remember a great performance of ""Untogether"" with Thom as her background vocals. That was cool! Anyway, This is a highly creative work of music and it's nice to see that people out their still appreciate it. Even if it's a little to popish at times."
4,Great way to carry around your gear,"I pack my 13"" Apple Macbook, Canon 40D, 50mm lens, 70-300mm lens, 10-20mm wide angle lens, and 28-135mm lens, as well as spare batteries, remotes, an external flash, and a couple filters in this bag.. sure, it's tight (and with all that stuff- heavy), but it holds it securely. Great bag for the money"
1,don't buy this!,"It is noisy, uses LOTS of energy, and the LCD panel went out within 1 week (we have to unplug to turn off). it is fast, but the ice tastes weird for about a month. I am very disappointed. I went by the reviews to help me pick the brand."
2,Doesn't last,"We have two of these portable ice makers in our office and have been through four of these in the past two years. We have them on daily for about 10-13 hours and use the ice very frequently. After a few months the ice cubes start getting smaller and smaller despite changing the size setting, and the ice-making tray would eventually stop pulling in water. In the beginning these ice makers are great, but they can't even last a year."
1,2 different units both stopped working,"My first unit was the Stainless Steel version and it worked for about 2 weeks and then I put my boat into storage for almost a year. After coming out of storage it worked for several weeks and started making a grinding noise and finally stopped with a electrical smell. Out of warranty so into the dumpster it went. Order a 2nd unit the AI-210W and followed instructions again, and it made the one full basket of ice and stopped completely, flashing red light that ice was full. The basket would not return up so the cooling fingers could dip into the water. Had to ship back and will not order another."
1,Made ice and made a mess.,"I got the item and read all instructions about running a batch of ice with vinegar in it to kill the plastic taste, etc. After the trial run, there was still water in the unit (which is heavy) so I removed the drain plug cap to drain...big mistake. Could not get the drain to stop leaking after that. Returned item for a prompt refund from Amazon."
3,"Good looking, does not play well with others","These are really nice sunglasses, from an ocular and style standpoint, but the nike flash mirror coating is really easily scratched. If you're spending this much on sunglasses, go for something a little more scratch resistant, like ray ban or something to that effect rather than being disappointed a few months later when its scratched to death and looks cheap."
4,it was good for the price,The case of the cds was a little more worn than i thought they would be but overall things were in good condition and i got it on time.
5,love tose old songs from my generation,Received these cds just before a trip from VA to TX.Took me over 200 miles of happy interstate driving(with nary a disaster)!
2,This DVD was repetitive and a little bit boring,I found this DVD to be kind of boring and repetitive. It was not very professional and I didn't get a lot out of it. I thought a lot of the information was just common sense. I also purchased Aimee's Babies and I liked it so much more. Aimee is a pediatric occupational therapist with a ton of information. It was much more informative and professionally made. I would definitely recommend Aimee's Babies over this one.
4,Listen to again and again.,The sound track caught my attention when I saw the original movie. Now it has become one of my staple CDs to lift me up. CD makes me smile for it readily brings back scenes from the movie.[...]
5,Date songs girls want to hear,"Notting Hill is one of my favorite movies so I'm slightly biased towards this cd. I love, love, love it! Never tought I liked Boyzone, but then I heard ""No matter what"" and what can I say. To be honest thought tracks 10 to 13 are total fill-ins and I didn't even put them on my MP3. Listen to it at home mostly, but if I'm in the office by myself, I crank up the volume."
4,Just right,"This soundtrack is a wonderful compilation of some marvelous new artists as well as some classics by some old favorites. The best track of the whole CD is Bill Withers' ""Ain't no Sunshine."" There is a heart and soul to that song that can make anyone miss that special someone--even if they're in the next room! This CD is a ""must-buy"" for the sappy music buff. The producers of ""Notting Hill"" did a great job of pulling together just the right music to enhance the film."
5,GREAT Movie.....GREAT soundtrack,"This movie is one of the best I have seen in a very long time. Julia Roberts and Hugh Grants are both extremely charming! Not only does it have the perfect display of romance, but a wonderful bit of humor! The soundtrack is just as good. ""She"" and ""Ain't no Sunshine"" just add flavor to the CD and make it simply a must have! I love the opening bit when the show Julia to the song of ""She""....oh, just makes me want to run to the theater and see it again.....so if you get the CD, make sure you have a few more bucks in your pocket...cause once you put the CD in, you'll want to see the movie again!!!!"
5,great CD for summer,"i loved this cd. very romantic, and just feels like how love should be. ""she"" is the best."
3,nothing better to do than stare out of the window and cry?,"....then its ok. like most people i think its beautiful for having 'ain't no sunshine' and 'she' but nothing else really sticks out. but, if your'e in the mood for curling up and dreaming about someone, and your cd player has a 'continuous repeat' button, then buy it. it is pretty lovely, especially when you live in notting hill."
1,"Dire, horrible, sickening.","The film was OK. Schmaltzy, but funny and reasonably well-observed.But the soundtrack........well, Elvis Costello and Al Green must be short of money. I can't think of any other reason why they'd consent to have their songs used alongside this pile of sub-R. Kelly, sickening, soulless soul trash.Confirms my impression that Ronan Keating is going to be the same horrible influence on 90s/00s UK music that Babyface has already been on the US. Although to be fair, Another Level et al are quite happy to provide similarly uninspired material...Bye bye originality, hello songs for people with double-figure IQs to meet and reproduce to. If anyone can think of any other purpose for this album, I'd love to hear it.Boy-band pop's always been brain-dead, but at least it used to be fun...if you buy this album, make sure you have your brain AND adrenaline gland removed first."
5,wonderful songs,these songs make me feel good and also make me want to run out and see the movie since I have not seen it yet. Can't wait to get the cd
5,It has various artist that are spectacular!,I loved the CD. there was not one song on it that I didn't enjoy
4,Excellent,I'm satisfied with this product. It is expensive but my daughter wants this toy and she loves it a lot.i
3,The big kickoff to a solo career that didn't pan out,"A big, slick band launched Jaco's solo career after he left Weather Report. ""Liberty City"" and ""The Chicken"" are the most tuneful numbers; the rest are mostly vehicles for the band to solo and stretch out. It ain't Weather Report by a long shot, but it's much better than what was to come later."
3,The big kickoff for a so-so solo career,"I resubmit this review, to have it linked to my current list. A big, slick band launched Jaco's solo career after he left Weather Report. ""Liberty City"" and ""The Chicken"" are the most tuneful numbers; the rest are mostly vehicles for the band to solo and stretch out. It ain't Weather Report by a long shot, but it's much better than what was to come later."
1,hate them,I thought a cookie sheet was a cookie sheet. Not so. These bent during unpacking and when nestled (I have 6) are impossible to separate. I put 12 ramekins filled with chocolate cake on one to freeze and it couldn't hold the weight! They feel cheap and I am back to using my 20-year old ones.
3,Pretty stupid...and I love Melissa and Doug.,"My son was going through a trash truck obession phase like most little guys. So I bought this. He was too little to put it together with me, he was three, so good-'ol mom put it together for him and presented it that way to him for Christmas. not to mention this thing was a real B to put together, and I like to put things together. I may have even cried. Dumb.He loved it. Hes a very careful child and unlike my other two takes care of his stuff. After a few months it started falling apart. I'm talking screws coming loose...not just mine. The cab just fell off and after many attempts and a smattering of curse words it refused to stay together. The quality just wasn't here. The screws seemed wrong for the set. The pre- drilled holes were off. Not happy with it and I wanted it to be good so badly. Sadly, it's in the trash...ironic for a trash truck, huh?"
4,My boy loves this truck!,"My 5 year old is HELL on toys, destroys them as fast as you buy them. After we put this toy together he has not stopped ripping around the house with it. It is his favorite truck and handles the abuse my son doles out without a problem. After 6 month, its still good as new.It was a pain to put together though, but Im glad we did:)"
2,Postage costs ridiculous,"Postage cost for 1 bottle of Necta Sweet Saccharin tablets was about twice the cost of the item, and was calculated on a per unit basis, even tho the item was very small and several would go into an envelope. So ordering a number of them didn't reduce the cost to a reasonable amount. I would find a different source."
1,Don't Buy It,"I just received this book in the mail today and had a chance to look through. I love most knitting books, but this one is not nearly as ""hip"" as they make it out to be. My first clue was that most of the patterns call for acrylic yarn (not there is anything wrong with acrylic yarn), which is not the sign of a cutting edge knitting book. Secondly, there is no nice way to say this, the patterns are ugly. Most of them have very little shaping and most knitters do not need to buy a $20 pattern book that only calls for knitting big rectangles together. Basically, save your money and buy a Phildar or Rebecca magazine instead."
4,Makes me feel good music,"I read the book and saw the movie. I don't remember the music but when I heard ""Window in Time"" and ""The Sword and The Chalice"" from a friend, I looked for this music and was surprised to find it on Amazon. It's not listed anywhere else. These two songs are amazingly addictive and the rest of the album is good too. This got me thinking that there are tons more music out there no one knows about. I use Pandora, Amazon, and CDNOW to discover new tunes. Unfortunately, these tunes are not on Pandora, so few will get to experience these. If you're reading this, take a listen to these."
1,One Size Fits None,"If you're looking for a rubber stamp approach to life change, this is it. I found it to be a very legalistic approach when I read it."
4,Informative and inspiring look at what happened in Egypt post the 1952 revolution,"If you want to know how egypt changed socially and economically in the last 50 years this is the book to start from. It offers an entertaining as well as deep, board look and what happened to Egypt and how it slowly transformed to what it became now. One of the great features of Galal Amin in this book is that he maintains strict neutrality, neither supporting and attacking a certain side or group, he simply tries to relay to the reader what happened giving the reader a chance to decide for himself whether what happened was bad or good. For us young Egyptians who want to understand what the older folks are talking about when they ramble about the good old days, this is a must read. Truely entertaining."
1,bad laughing mirror,"I received this product and was going to give as a Xmas present. I tried and tried to get it to work, changed batteries again and again It finally did work one time when I thru it down but that was the only time.I just got frustrated with it and threw it away, since it was then to late to give as a present.Bob McKay"
3,good southern style rock,3 out of 5 stars. Good album for fans of Junkyard and the Four Horsemen to pick up. Starts a little slow with the first couple of tracks but gets better from there.
4,Very similar to the Hiero books,"Although I don't consider Menace Under Marswood to be as great an achievement as the Hiero books, it is quite good. The plot, tone, and characters are very similar to Lanier's other books and you are bound to like this if you are a Hiero fan.The plot, in brief: Centuries ago, Earth governments sent unmanned ships to terraform Mars. Some of the governments on Earth weren't included and responded by sending follow on ships containing the nastiest forms of life Earth had to offer. The end result is a wild and dangerous planet, almost too inhospitable for colonization. Some of the original settlers of Mars have gone native. These ""ruckers"" are now in conflict with the colonial government, which hides behind the walls of a few fortified complexes. To complicate the situation, a mysterious new movement has appeared among the ruckers, which may be controlled by a criminal from Earth or, possibly, the ""old martians."""
2,Very poor technical reproduction of a good concert,"This should have been a great concert DVD since Sutherland, Horne, and Bonynge are amoung the best of their time. Unfortunately, the video and audio looked and sounded like 1960s TV (it was actually recorded in the mid 1980s) with mostly out-of-focus video (it appears that the problem was a very shallow depth-of-field since the extreme closeups were more in focus)and dolby stereo (2.0) that sounded more like some of my old analog LPs than a digital recording. Its too bad they didn't digitally remaster the concert."
4,Disposable bags,"When decorating cakes, its really nice to use disposable bags. It saves a lot of clean up time! Very pleased."
5,Love them.,"Was using some expensive thing that I bought from Williams-Sonoma that busted when I tried to take it apart and clean. These frost and decorate just as well for a fraction of the price. Easy to insert frosting, easy to apply. Great product, great price."
