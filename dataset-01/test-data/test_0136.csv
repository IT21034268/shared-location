4,Charles Bronson Collection,Just simply loved this collection and will be ordering more of his movies soon. Thanks for good service. Helen in North Carolina
2,"It's a decent enough book, but absolutely riddled with errors that affect the key concepts they are trying to teach you","This has got to be the most error-riddled book that I've seen in my time at college. My professor has already had to email out almost 20 pages of errata for the first three chapters alone.For the ninth edition of a book, it really should be better proofed than that.Due to the quantity of errors, there's simply no way I can recommend this book to anyone who is trying to learn control systems. Save your money and go elsewhere."
5,Good Things Come from Those Who Wait,"I was a youngster when I first saw part of this movie. I recently discovered it and bought 2 videos, one of which I will send as a gift to Dr Zahi Hawass of the Supreme Council of Antiquities of the Cairo Museum. This is the first picture I've seen with Joan Collins that I can remember. It is, in its own way definitely an Epic. It was filmed on location in Egypt and features some scenes of almost 10,000 paid extras (native Egyptian). It is a ""must see to believe"" motion picture of the life of the Pharoah ""Chufu"" and the building of the Great Pyramid and some very special FX are spectacular! It is a ""Must See"" to believe! No one will be disappointed. Definitely a great ""must have""! Raymond C. Root"
1,very disappointing!,"I, too , am re-discovering Ray Conniff after many years and wish I had started my re-discovery with another CD. These certainly would not have been my 16 most requested songs. The old Ray Conniff harmony was just not there, and the ""non-vocals""(which I've never cared for anyway) were especially disappointing. I'll just have to keep trying."
4,A good first study for the Lisp beginner,"With only mild prerequisites in computer science and/or math, Paul Graham gently but quite fully introduces the rudiments of Common Lisp. This was my first Lisp book, recommended to me by a Lisp-fluent student in college when I had to learn the language for an AI class. While I then moved on to more referencial works, like Steele's _Common Lisp: The Language_, Graham is still a foundation for much of the basic grammar, structure, and reasoning behind the form of the language.While Graham does delve into some interesting coding examples in the second half of the book, _ANSI Common LISP_ is not meant to replace a referential or exemplary book concerning the language. If you're looking for a more case-study sort of book, I suggest Norvig's _Paradigms of AI programming_ or Tanimoto's _Elements of Artificial Intelligence_. Both offer a wealth of examples that Graham rightfully omits in order to more broadly cover the fundamentals of the language itself."
3,Could be better,"The beads were great colors,smooth and perfect for this ""job"". The problem is with the threading cord.It is simply a piece of cord and was very difficult for the 19 month old to use. I took a piece of a well known old type wooden building toy and utilized a 2 inch dowel peice to attach to one end of the cord. This made the act of threading much easier and the toy more enjoyable and less frustrating. We had also thought of just dipping one end in wax or glue to stiffen."
4,Pretty Good,"This is actually not a The The album. It lacks the unity that is present in other The The albums. Despite that, a new Thethe listener could start listening with this album. It is not the best option though. If you are new to Thethe, I recommend you first listen to Soul Mining so that you could enjoy Mind Bomb...I envy those people who have not listened to TheThe. They have got a lot to explore!"
4,An old Classic,"Often, when I search for information on vibration isolation and stability, this book comes up as a reference. Apparently it is not made anymore, so I was happy to be able to buy it here online."
1,I'd have to be held at knife point in order to use this,This is a horribly misadvertised product. Emjoi has the nerve to say no pain! I beg to differ. I consider myself to have a fairly good tolerance for pain. I have my eyebrows waxed and barely flinch. This product on the other hand has me jumping and screaming like someone is trying to kill me. I tried to use it six months ago and could not take it. I put it away hoping to get the nerve to try it again. I tried two weeks ago and I had the same reaction. I can't believe this product is on the market. Torture!!!!
5,Fun read.,"I have read many, many WoD novels. This book does have some holes, but that is actually what makes it more enjoyable to read. It's different from a lot of the humdrum, ""this guy sired this guy who sired this guy...""We are introduced to a character who is an elder and who wanders around with no strings. This totally flies in the face of everyday vampire world fiction of strict classes and clan ties. It is refreshing and sometimes quite surprising.Also, the fact that I actually in Tampa, FL (Seffner 4-life BABY!!!), allows me to say with some certainty that the author has portrayed Tampa in a very realistic and entertaining light.Great read."
4,Great,Printed and recorded great! Great product and will Deffinately buy again. Only thing was when delivered te wrapper was broken so they all moved around but only a few were scratched
1,Highly variable quality?,"After reading reviews on these and other CD-R's I would have to conclude it is a crap shoot when you buy a batch. The particular batch of Verbatim I got give me anywhere from 1 error to 200 million errors when verifying after burning music. Even slowing to 2x burn does not matter. Just to make sure, I pulled out some old Memorex and a couple old Phillips and burned the same music. No errors on either of those. Then I went to my other computer and got similar results. (Might as well experiment, because I don't want to commit good data to these disks)I suggest you look at all the brands, look at the dates on the reviews, and then try the recently best-rated ones. Or as one reviewer suggested, try to buy locally. Then they go back after the second bad disk.It's hard to find the hub-printable ones locally, however.Ben"
5,Excellent Disc,I have run through 5 packages and only one disc was rejected by my system. Label easy to write on.
1,A bad batch of CDs?,"These CD-R disks are not recognized by with my Windows 7 Sony Laptop, nor my Dell Win XP desktop.The operating system offers to format these disks, but fail in the attempt.I discovered this too late to return them."
3,Please EDIT!,"The original paper book is fine. Dry but informative.Like others in this series that have been Kindleized, some of the double column pages have been scanned and junbled into a single text. Sometimes the original scanned page is included, so if you can read tiny letters you can follow the text. Could someone edit these just to avoid the jumbled words? They do cost money."
2,what's with the malfunctions?,"I bought this toy for my 4 month old. I liked the educational value of it, plus she likes pianos and keyboards. Although I must warn that the one I bought had a ""sticky key"". Every time a key was pressed the elephant would go off afterwards. The elephant would sound off randomly when know one was even playing with it! It was also christmas time and it had probably been played with in the store. Needless to say I returned it and all the others at the store did the same thing. I bought the Classical Symphony instead. She found it much more amusing. I can set it above her in her crib and watch her play with it for hours!"
4,My 2 month old little girl loves this toy,"(written by Mom)My 2 month old little girl loves this toy. She especially likes the play and learn mode on the number 2 setting. She can kick the image and it meows or barks etc... and plays a song and lights up wildly. She's been a kicker from day one and this is a perfect toy for a kicker. The only things I do not like is the volume - it is a little too loud. I put a cotton ball on the little speaker to muffle it. Also, on the number 1 setting for songs, it plays whether she kicks it or not. I wish it would only play if she kicked it. Other than that it is a GREAT toy and really keeps her attention and I highly recommend this for a young baby - there are not too many toys out there for such a young baby."
5,extraordinary,"Race Against Evil is an extraordinary book; like its author, it is difficult to love, but worth loving. As far as attention-grabbing first chapters go, Bannon leads the field. Written without self-pity Race Against Evil is fascinating. It is told with a mixture of humor, passion and searing intelligence that makes it a riveting and uplifting story."
4,Can't be too careful!,"If you have children, read this book. Most of us can't go do the things David did. However, each and everyone of us can start at home and always be aware of where our childen are all the time. I've read many books on this subject, of people abusing childen, most being technical or from the victims side. David's book allowed me to live a little vicariously through the pages. Needless to say, I would not hesitate to avenge my childrens abuse/death in any number or ways described in the book, as I too have been trained in a varity of meathods. However, an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Parents, know where your children are and know who is watching them when you are not. Do not expect your public servants to help you. They can't and/or won't."
1,Fraud Lies and Bull,"It should interest readers to know, David ""Race"" Bannon is a fraud named David Wayne Dilley. Everything in the book was made up. In 2004, the Interpol General Secretariat issued the following statement about Bannon's book:""Interpol's General Secretariat in Lyon has no record of David Race Bannon having been employed and no knowledge of individuals mentioned in Mr Bannon's book. Interpol exists to facilitate the exchange of information between the world's law enforcement agencies and to provide analysis of criminal data and other services. Accordingly, the claims in Mr Bannon's book can only be seen as deceptive and irresponsible fantasy.The above disclaimer was distributed to US law enforcement agencies by the US National Central Bureau of Interpol and to other potentially interested parties by the General Secretariat.""He was indicted for and pled guilty to the charge of criminal impersonation.The book is dangerous fantasy and an insult to real victims of abuse."
2,Photo tray doesn't work well,"Its a good printer for regular printing, but trying to print a photo is a pain. You have to push and hold the photo paper into the photo tray so that the printer recognizes that the paper is in it. This only works sometimes, you'll have to fight error after error message to get it to work."
1,Worst HP printer I have ever used.,This thing is junk. I had purchased this printer mainly for it capabilities to print on CD/DVDs. When loading CDs into the provided tray it scathes the bottom of the CD. And if your lucky enough to get it to print on the to of the CD it does a good job of scratching that too. Provided software is a joke. I can’t fathom why a print driver would be so large and take so long to install.
1,Expected as much,"Silliness.But of course it is.What else could it be with the title quite accurate.It's a fun read, but not too fun.Don't buy it. Even for free"
4,Intriguing,"I think ""Crystal"" was a short but wonderful novel. Crystal was incredibly smart, but had the attitude of an average teenager. She wanted what every orphan wished for: a loving family, happiness, and freedom. Then Karl and Thelma Morris came into her life. Even with an overly organized father, and a mother caught up in her imaginary life of books and soap operas, Crystal's life finally begins to even out. I love how the plot unfolds and the story ends with a shocking conclusion. Though I have read better V.C. Andrews books, this one was well worth my time. I encourage teenagers and young adults to read it, as well as the other books in the V.C. Andrews Orpahn miniseries."
3,good but can't compare with original works,The new books lack something V. C. Andrews gave to her work. Crystal was better than Butterfly and was a good short read. I keep reading but...I miss that something
4,Finally!!,I am so glad this book is finally out. I liked Janet alot better than Crystal. Her personality really reminded me of the oldest daughter in Flowers In The Attic. I can't wait for the next one. Brooke sounds really good from the insert in the back of Crystal. Runaways should be wonderful. I want that other Melody book to come out.
5,Western action of old,I was impressed with the quality of the dvd. The picture and audio are very clear. Watching these videos takes me back to a simpler time when we sat around the TV on Saturday nights together and watched a few westerns. It is interesting how much they could get into a 30 minute show
1,Extremely poorly made DVD's,"Probably the poorestWanted Dead or Alive - The Complete Seriesmade DVD's I have ever had the misfortune to purchase in the USA. They ALL freeze for a period, then continue (after missing some of the program). If I had paid any more for these, I would go to the trouble of returning them. Amazon should DISCONTINUE doing business with the company that makes these DVD's - - it reflects badly on Amazon..."
4,Great price for all 3 seasons!,"DVD. Man, did they pack in a bunch of episodes per season or what back-in-the-day? It's sure not like the puny seasons we see today. Packaging was okay with us, Amazon delivered as usual - ontime. I'm not sure how many states force sales tax upon their citizens, but we're one of them.But I digress - back to the series. Video quality varied from okay to good, with the first episode being rather dark and fuzzy, but for the price we were't expecting digital re-mastered episodes, just some well written stories and the man himself - Steve McQueen!"
3,"great series, cheaply made.","Same as ""Wiseguy"", Mill Creek sets a very low price but on some DVD's this may not play.But Steve McQueen was very very cool. I used to own a toy cut-off winchester, wonder what happened to it."
1,Disgusting,I have not bought the book nor would I ever buy it. I looked at the look in side part on Amazon. What I read was an insult to Il Divo. For it to be tagged with Il Divo is a crime. It is purely disgusting porn. It should not be read by anyone. I would not rate this book anything but horrible. I am so disgusted that it has anything to do with Il Divo. They should sue this so call author.
4,South Pacific Ocean map,"It's exactly what it says it is - a map of the Pacific Islands to show the general geography of the area, but not in as much detail as a guide book. These maps are hard to find but I got exactly what I wanted. It shows a big map of the Pacific Islands plus smaller maps of specific islands in more detail. The only thing I would like it to show which it doesn't, is the markers to show where Micronesia, Melanesia and Polynesia are(although without having all of NZ in it, obviously the bottom of the Polynesian triangle would be cut off.)"
5,READ IT IN ONE DAY!,"I also wasn't sure how relevant this book would be to me, a 31 year old mom. But, it was a phenomenal read! I finished it in one day (and that is w/ a 3 year old toddler to run after). The writing was brillant, the story utterly engaging, the topic of eating disorders handled w/ candor and care. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who finds it even a bit interesting. Can't wait for a follow up!"
5,Musical,"I have always enjoyed musicals, this is no exception. It is a great classic musical anyone would enjoy. The actors in it are great and the drama and music is wonderful."
1,no update on 1961 movie T,"The movie West Side Story won 10 Awards. You would think that a update DVD would have been made,but no. The colors are washed out which ruins quite a bit of the movie. You would think someone would have remaster to protect this classic movie."
3,Damaged Item,"I bought this product as a Christmas gift, and specifically for the book enclosed. A relative was in the movie as one of the Jets, and he was going to autograph the book before I gave the gift. Much to my disappointment, when we opened the book the stitching from the spine also ran across the pages. Not Amazon's fault, that lies with the manufacturer, but a disappointment none the less."
5,The best muscial ever!,"West Side Story is the greatest musical ever made in the history of American film. It will sweep you off your feet as it carries you through a tale of love, hate, music, and dancing. With the collabration of Leonard Bernstein's score, Stephen Sondheim's lyric's, Robert Wise's direction, and most important the choreography of Jerome Robbins with all of that combined into a musical will have an enormous effect on you the viewer. So if need to see great dancing, or just a musical consider West Side Story the movie you take home."
4,I cannot believe they painted Natalie Wood's face!!!,"Update - Second comment: a Puerto Rican would never refer to the United States as ""America"" (as the song goes ""I Like to Live in America""). This is simply because ""America"" is North America, Central America and South America. ""America"" for a Puerto Rican refers to all three Americas.I have only one comment: What were they thinking when they decided to paint Natalie Wood's face? She could have easily pass for Puerto Rican without having that awful paint on."
2,"What mirror, where?","Sorry, didn't get it. Not my cup of tea. I think you have to be either a card carrying member AARP or you know, appreciate of the arts to enjoy this sing songy blah blah blah movie with no explosions or sex scenes. I'm neither."
4,"Oh so Old, But Oh So Beautiful...","This is one of those movies that just stays.Like the trailer of this movie says: ""Unlike other classics, the Westside Story grows younger.""When I first saw the trailer, I found that hard to believe, but when I saw the movie, I came to the conclusion it's the truth.The movie is a classic that just grabs your heart.This '60's Romeo and Juliet kind of story is maqnificent!The dancing, the acting, the singing, the characters, the sets ,the feeling --> it's just special.No wonder that this movie won 10 academy awards in 1961, it deserves it! You can see that much time and work has been put in this movie. The result? Breathtaking!With songs like ""Maria"", ""Somewhere"", ""One hand, one Heart"" , ""Tonight"", this movie will leave a mark in your mind and your heart.Even if the movie is over 40 years old, it keeps entertaining and one of a kind.Oh so old, but oh so beautiful."
1,Error Ridden Restoration,"Buyers should be aware that there are huge restoration errors in this release, starting with the opening credits (fade to black instead of dissolves) and including but not limited synch problems as well. Fox has said they will replace discs with the proper restored version but they should never have been released to begin with."
3,Less Than Perfect Sound,"This magnificent film is truly ageless. I won't bother discussing the plot as so many others have. I simply wish to call your attention to the sound quality of the otherwise perfectDVD. In a word, the sound ""stinks."" Far more attention should have been paid to such a crucial element of this film. It's muddy and poorly mixed, especially during the musical numbers. Or perhaps it's just a sloppy digital transfer. Happily, the picture quality is excellent. So, why was so little attention paid to sound? It's a mystery."
1,Disappointment,"I selected this item as a present for my significant other while he was working on the road. It has been 3 months, and I have yet to receive my first copy. Requests for information have not had any response.For shame, Amazon!"
3,A very different Tracy.,This is a story about Brian and a couple of his friends who travel the world and cross the Sahara as young guys who don't really know what they're in for. They all exit this adventure having found out a lot about themselves and each other. Kind of a story book with a message.
2,Not what I thought it was....,"I used to LOVE this product. I used this on my face to remove some unwanted hair above my lip, and between my eyebrows. For that it worked great, but did leave my skin a bit irritated. To me that wasnt such a big deal, considering what a diffrent hair removal product did to me.I just recently used 'Hair No More' on my arms to remove the hair.... well it removed more than just the hair. This is the worst hair removal product I have ever used. On my arms Ive got burns, and skin missing! Yes, it removed some of my skin and I left it on for the recommended 7-10 minutes. It was horrible! And it didnt even remove the hair completly. So now Ive got white patches on my arm, from where the skin is gone, red marks from irritation, and patches of hair on my arm since it didnt work correctly.I will not be recommending this item to anyone else since it is so unpredictable, and dangerous!"
5,Great product.,Got this product to remove unwanted facial and arm hair. Works as described and is wonderful. It removed the facial hair quickly without the pain ot tweezers.
3,Jury's in!,"When comparing Sally Hansen's hair removing product along with Nair body and Hair no more, this is what I have determined. The Hair No More stinks the least by far but is less effective than the Sally Hansen and Nair products. Hair No More is almost twice as expensive per ounce and requires similar volumes. Hair No More is the least irritating and least stinky product but also rather weak. If you are looking for an effective workhorse for your legs and don't mind the stick, Sally Hansen gives you the most bang for the buck. If you are using it close to your genitalia, than Hair No More is the safest. Walgreens and CVS stock Sally Hansen and Nair."
3,Hair No more,"I was very excited to buy this product becaue they made it seem like this was state of the art, but this product was no more better than any other cream hair remover. In fact, I would prefer Nair better. If you leave the product on too long your skin becomes irritated and red. The hair would never come off all at once if you did it for the time they said leave it, and if you leave it on longer, you run the risk of burning yourself. As far as the hair taking longer to grow back? That is a big fat lie. It seemed to me the hair would grow back faster and thicker. So my advice is to spend your money on buying a %5 container of nair or Sally Hansen because at you will not expect AMAZING results."
4,Another Bujold entry,"This is not the usual Miles Naismith Vorkisigan tale. Most of this story is told form the point of view of his latest love interest. She is most like Tuara in her first appearance but has some slight elements of Elena. But if your looking for her to be a slick talking, shoot from the hip and answer only the questions that don't matter Elli Quinn type you'll be disappointed. But should you take this story as an independent story and not try and force her to be a new Elli you may like this tale I did."
4,Bujold's latest Miles Vorkosigan adventure a worthy effort.,"""Komarr"" is Bujold's lastest offering in the Miles Vorkosigan series, as Miles draws ever-closer to finding a woman willing to live permanently in his shadow but strong enough to cast one of her own. While this book is certainly as fast-paced and well-plotted as ever, it doesn't quite reach the heights of ""Memory"" or ""Barrayar"". Still, Miles' new career as Imperial Auditor is certainly well-suited to his talents and hopefully will generate a wealth of exciting scenarios for years to come!"
4,Preview available from Baen Books,"To all McMaster Bujold fans: the first five chapters of this title are available from the Baen Books website. The story starts with a bang, literally, when an orbiting mirror array is damaged above Komarr. Two Imperial auditors arrive to inspect and oversee the investigation. Miles is one of them. I can't wait for the full story: have we finally met the Lady Vorkosigan Miles is looking for? Is her husband really going to be history, and soon? It seems likely, but Bujold is not known for doing the obvious. And I want to know more about the experimental research station that's eating up money but no-one has been to in years... The first five chapters set up several intriguing plotlines."
3,Latest in the Shopworn Vorkosigan Saga,"""Komarr"" is a Miles Vorkosigan story when Miles is 30. It's the latest in the who-knows-how-long-it-will-run Vorkosigan soap opera.I like Bujold, and this series is about the only one I follow. And, there is nothing special about the series, it's a vanilla space opera, except for the characters, and the brilliant, stunted Miles is a gem. In this particular installment Mile's may have found the love of his life.However, how long will this series go on? With ten books in the series, its starting to wear a bit thin.Recommended for Vorkosigan addicts as their next dose."
5,Business of living ...,"The perfume industry and theater make interesting backdrops to this haunting story. The heroine, whose parents are deceased dreams of her father as the business of living comes much too fast. An unforgettable novel.Janet Sue Terry, author of the ""Set Me Free"" series, book 1 - ""Possibilities"", book 2 - Resolutions, and ""Just Our Best Short Stories 2005"". www.janetsueterry.com. CEO of Just My Best Book Publishing Company, www.jmbpub.com"
1,horrible,"I hate to write bad reviews but this movie deserves it.I am a big fan of the original.The original scares me every time I watch it.But this movie is laughably dumb.Skip this one and forget that it ever existed.If you want more exorcist watch the third one,it is much much better."
3,where going flying Regan,I enjoyed the movie. Though it was sort of corny it was still enjoyable. That groovy music durning the creadits rocked. Hey did you check Regan out when she heard the demons calling her name and she was in that sexy nightgown with her you know whats where showing. A little brief nudity.
2,Pretty Bad,"As far as sequels go, this IS one of the worst. Although it is watchable (especially if you enjoy bad movies). The writing is bad, the acting is pretty non-existent, and the dialogue is horrendous. A previous reviewer claims that Exorcist 3 had nothing to do with the first. WRONG. Exorcist 2 was an attempt to cash in on the huge success of the first film. It is a waste of a great cast, a lot of money, and the audience's time. Exorcist 3, however, brings the return of William Peter Blatty who wrote the novel and the screenplay for the first film. Exorcist 3 incorporates many scenes from the novel (which were not used in the first film), along with the storyline from Legion, (another novel by Blatty). Anyway, I digress. In closing, this movie plain old sucks. I do recommend buying the complete Anthology set. You get both versions of the first film, 2, 3, and both versions of 4. At least you can see this movie without wasting money on it directly."
1,There are actually people that like this movie?,"This movie is just so bad, I don't even know where to start. Richard Burton OVERacts and Louise Fletcher UNDERacts. It's clear that director John Boorman was more interested in the technical aspects of the film, such as the special effects, and therefore left the actors to their own devices. Ellen Burstyn wisely chose to skip this movie, and the Exorcist III actually ignores this film, picking up from the first one. This movie simply isn't scary, but the actors react as if they're in a thriller, which makes the movie slightly comical. This movie is so bad, it's not even good in a 'bad' way, and yet many folks have given this movie 4 or 5 stars on this board. Perhaps the demon Pezuzu is at work again!"
5,One of the GREATEST bad movies of all time!!!,"I absolutely love this movie with my heart, though not in the same way as I love the origional. The origional Exorcist is one of the greatest horror films of all time, second only to Robert Wise's The Haunting, and a watershed movie in the history of American cinema. Exorcist II - The Heretic is one of my favorite bad movies because it is so laughably bad. The idea itself is decent but the execution is so off it's entertaining. You would think with actors like Richard Burton and James Earl Jones in the cast, and a director like John Boorman (Zardoz) at the helm, this would be a worthy successor. The scene to watch for is at the very end of the movie, with Linda Blair twirling some imaginary thing around her head to calm a bunch of wild locusts, that makes it so worth while. If you want a great cheesy double feature, watch this with Roller Boogie."
3,"The Worst Ever, But Man Is It Ever Funny!!!!!","If you can't make a scary follow-up to the scariest movie ever what do you do, well here we get a ""DUD"" of epic proportions that is really a very funny and silly movie. It takes it's self so serious, that the laughs flow often as the movie rolls on.Worth a look at least once!"
1,Career lows for many...,"Those guys who decided the Golden Turkey Awards chose this as 2nd worst film, next to ""Plan 9"". I must admit I'd rather watch ""Plan 9"" or listen to my hair grow than be subjected to ""Ex II"". Mr. Boorman must've thought a lot of people liked wild jungle rhythms while being bored and baffled. I was annoyed. Ms. Blair should've known better, because she is talented. Mr. Burton, too, but at the end of his career, he was stretching a lot (not unlike the great Rod Steiger in ""Amityville""), looking for legitimacy. Overacting seemed to be their way of overcoming the rotten script. Unfortunately, it never happened for them. ""Ex II"" is among the sorriest examples of acting, editing, sound recording, and just about everything else that makes filmmaking an art. I understand that there were studio demands, so I can't blame Mr. Boorman, whom I admire. ""Plan 9"" and Ed Wood didn't have studio support. That's why I think this MUST be the worst film of all time."
4,only dvd that my standalone will write to,"I purchased a standalone DVD recorder about 18 months ago. This is the only type of DVD that it will reliably record to. Until a few months ago I could find these locally at the common superstore for 1/4 the price. Now the newer, high speed DVDs sold locally, won't work unless perhaps I do some kind of upgrade to my DVD recorder. I was extremely pleased to find these still available, even if they are overpriced. I find that I must use DVDs that have a definite purplish color on the write side and they must not be the higher speed type. I hope this information helps someone. I would have given these DVDs 5 stars but the price is too high."
1,Beware of conflicting advertising,"This article is LISTED as 4x, TITLED 8x, PHOTO SHOWS 4x, & TECHNICAL DATA shows 4x. Four times I have had to send this item back because I ordered 4x and received 8x. For those of you who, like me, have an older DVD Recorder that WILL NOT RECORD on 8x or ""1-8x"" discs (I confirmed this with the manufacturer!), be careful when you order. If you actually get the Digital Movie DVD-R 4x, they are the best and least troublesome I have ever bought. If you get the 8x, they are useless unless your machine can handle them"
3,Item received different than pictured,"I was disappointed that what I received was different than the item pictured. Although I received similar contents - the tool + blades, I received a red one in a box with no wrapping, giving the impression it had been used or opened before. All the blades were inside of the tool and the tool was just placed in the box. I already own a red one and was hoping for the purple, but I guess I'll find out when I use the blades whether they've been used or not. I did receive the item much faster than I had expected though (because it doesn't ship from amazon). This seller should make a point of delivering what they advertise!"
5,An ideal introduction for the novice.,"This examines the beliefs, rites and rituals of Wiccan religion and practices, examining how magic powers work, how to consider sample spells, and using rituals to enhance celebration and worship processes. Geared to newcomers to the Wiccan spiritual path, this assume no prior familiarity."
1,Economy here's your problem,"Full of laws that should be scrapped, did you hear that corporations are people to now. This should be obsolete shortly.Updated for 2012: Hey 6 people who found my review useless! Who knew? Collapse! Transaction not secure. Epic fail."
1,The orchestra is under water,"The other reviewers are having us on. This recording was obviously made from a 1950's reel-type tape recorder and with the tape replay varying in speed. As if that were not bad enough, the orchestra is almost certainly playing under water. If you want something that sounds worse than you ever got from the old bakelite 78rpms, buy this one. If you want Bruckner's 7th to sound as it should, with rich, vibrant strings and majesty, buy Furtwangler but not this disc."
2,"Broken, does not speak","The toy is fine, however it does not work properly because it does not talk. It is broken, even with batteries it does not work."
4,"Packaging, Packaging","Receiver was shipped directly from the manufacturer. The carton was open in several places and the receiver was scraped at the ends and at the 2"" receiver end. I had to force open the end plates on the receiver 1/8"" for the unit to fit my Explorer's pre drilled holes. Thankfully the hardware was securely taped to the receiver and no bolts were lost. After installation had to spray paint the receiver to hide all the scrapes. I did not have to drill holes and the bolting was a breeze. The unit is solid and am satisfied with the quality.Packaging was the problem and Amazon should expect that suppliers deliver their products properly wrapped and secure."
4,Install was fairly easy,"The product seems to be great. It was a little tough to install though, but not too bad. I installed one side, but didn't tighten it down all the way, but when I moved to the other side, it wasn't fitting. After a struggle, I decided to install the second side first. This time, it worked just fine. Hooked up my cargo carrier and was on my way. Nice product. I do have to say though, the shipping package was pretty sad. It came in a box with nothing to keep the receiver from shifting around inside it. The corners of the box were torn up, but the product itself was not damaged. A little padding or packing material would have been good."
2,I am not impressed,It was O.K.but just not anything special. The action and drama was unemotional without much suspense.
3,"YOU GET WHAT YOU WANT-ACTION,VIOLENCE,INTEREST","This book certainly provided enough food for discussion in thisreview list. Whether Carcaterra is a one hit wonder or not-he stillmanaged to get over 65 people to comment on his work. Personally, i love brainless action with minimum character development. You get more than six stories in one novel. What more can you want? This is no literary masterpiece, but definitely a page turner whether you've read Sleepers or not!"
1,Just plain bad,"The only good thing(s)that can ever be said about this book is that it's a quick read and has some action (ridiculous as it is) to keep you from getting too bored. But that is true of many many bad books, and this is one of the worst novels I've read of late. I dont' understand Lorenzo Carcaterra. You think he'd try to build a good reputation after Sleepers became a best-seller (as questionably ""true"" as it was) but this is terrible. Terrible. I don't know, maybe he just had a contract to write an incredibly stupid, cliched, comic-book crime novel, but this is one of those books that should have went straight to paperback. Recommended only if you have read EVERY other book you have ever wanted to read."
1,A bad attempt at an underestimated genre.,"I read the synopsis of this novel and assumed that it was either a police procedural or a hardboiled action novel. It was neither. If anything, it was a weak attempt at the latter. Carcaterra, like so many others, thinks that writing hardboiled fiction is easy - just write about some big guys with guns and villians that perform unspeakable evils. You don't need a tight plot, just action, baby! Wrong. Good hardboiled fiction has flavor, substance, and mood. J.L. Burke writes such poetic narrative, I can smell New Orleans as I read. J. Ellroy's narrative echoes the yellow journalism of the 40's and 50's, and transports me to that time. Lorenzo Carcaterra proves with Apaches, that it takes a lot more than tough cops and heartless villians to create good hardboiled fiction."
1,CRIMINALLY bad,"If you want a bad book, look no further than Apaches. I wound up wondering if Carcaterra meant this book to be even a fraction serious. If he did, then another waste of binding glue should bury his career hopefully. Six cops who all got injured in the line of duty decide to form a renegade group of cops who fight drug dealers and kidnappers. Stereotypes abound, laughable inattention to detail, blatant lazy construction. If this book was a house it would collapse after one flush of the toilet, where this thing should end up! I want the $5 I spent on an excess stock hardcover (I should have known better than to buy a recent hardcover marked down so cheap!!!) If I could give half a star I would!"
3,"Oh, my God....","I love this book. I am a Carcaterra fan, and this book just makes me want to read more of his books. I definitely suggest you read it."
4,Very Good Read,"I read some of the other reviews before writing mine and didn't agree with alot of the nit picking. After all a book of this nature is for entertainment purposes. Have some imagination! Haven't you ever read Stephen King? At first, the book was so disturbing, I almost couldn't keep reading but I hung with it and was glad I did. I enjoyed the cop's characters very much. They become very real and likeable."
3,Apaches Fails to Meet Expectations,"Superficial. Shallow. Fluff. I read Carcaterra's ""SLEEPER'S"" and considered it an outstanding book. I was less than enthralled with ""Apaches"". I found the characters to be too similar to one another and the the plot never moved below the surface. There was very little character development and the book never really rolled smoothly to its predictable conclusion, rather it jumped awkwardly from scene to scene, character to character. It was a fast read because of the action but, overall, a disappointing effort. Mr. Carcaterra is a master at re-creating the New York City of his adolescence and I hope he mines this territory in his next effort."
5,Great Purchase,"I was very impressed with the timely arrival of my product. It was in great condition just as was stated on the website. Overall, it was a great purchasing experience!"
2,DULL VANILLA SCENT,I purchased a small sample bottle in a store. The container is very cute and I plan to keep it. The fragance is dull vanilla.
3,"A little too sweet, but cute","I tried this today at Macy's since I really like Curious. This one is a little too sweet for my tastes. It would probably be a good scent for teenagers who like smelling like candy, but for working professionals it is a little too juvenile. I prefer Curious, which smells youthful and light, but not like you just took a bath in sugar."
5,Crafting Personal Shrines,"The book gave beautiful pictures and detailed instructions, a bit complex though...good thing im a shrine artist already, I have my own techniques with the same materials which is MUCH Simpler..I learned a few new tricks I may use sometime!"
5,Sad that truth in this book goes unreported.,The true problem is that the religion and experiences described in this book are so offensive to some that they attack the author and ignore the truth that the book exposes. I have studied the Quran and teaching since Sept 11th 2001 and find Dr. Caner view to be correct. The interesting lame attack by a man that has most likely even met Dr. Caner tells you more about this book and its validity than anything I can say. In the nature of true disclosure let me state I have met and listen to many sermons from Dr. Caner and find him to be the the light of the earth. I also noticed that the negative reviews of this book were name calling unsubstantiated mumblings of those with nothing informative to say..
1,omg the worst book ever,"wow, i cant believe how bad this book is. its incredible. stop begging for people to buy it on facethejury.com!"
1,Painful.,"This is without doubt the single most facile and awful book it has ever been my misfortune to read. Its literary style is that of a dysfunctional four-year-old with learning difficulties. The paper-thin vapid plot is as empty as the excruciating dialog between the characters. It is actually physically painful to read much more than the first few hundred words. If you do preserver and complete this monstrosity you may agree with me that the old theory, that if you put an infinite number of monkeys in a room with an infinite number of typewriters they would eventually produce the complete works of Shakespeare, has some truth to it. As this book reads very much like their first attempt at it."
4,kept me interested,This book was about a girl named Kara and her stories of a life as a pigeon. It jumps around to differant stories that in the end all fit together. This book kept me interested untill the end and more and more interested in the characters and how they fit together so I do suggest you give it a try!!
3,Vasco da Gama trip seen from an Indian perspective,"While the book certainly merits praise for its extensive research, one cannot help but see that the author takes every opportunity to throw pot shots at the Portuguese, failing in the process to highlight the merit that this trip had to the whole world. A more objective, less emotional approached would have greatly improved your work. José Dores, Toronto, Canada 5 September 1998"
2,An honest but completly outdated work,"It must be remembered that this book was written in 1967. Since then however, the death of Hirohito has revealed many primary sources which indicate that the emperor and his family were much more implicated in the conduct of the war than the view promoted by Mac Arthur's propaganda.Some authors like Yoshiaki Yoshimi even discovered that Hirohito personally authorized the use of chemical weapons against civilians.For a much more updated study, you should readHirohito and War: Imperial Tradition and Military Decision Making in Prewar Japanby Peter Wetzler, The Showa emperor 15 years war by Akira Fujiwara, The Showa emperor as commander in chief by Akira Yamada orHirohito and the Making of Modern Japanby Herbert Bix"
4,A REAL Chinese cookbook in English!,"I was delighted to find this book at my local library. I grew up in Hong Kong, the food paradise, eating real Chinese food. Most Chinese cookbooks in English disappoint me with Americanized recipies (some of the entries I don't even recognized as Chinese food!). This cookbook though, contains most all Chinese food that I enjoy eating at home. I tried making a couple items, and I can testify the authenticity of the recipes. Some of the recipes are complicated, but I can find plenty recipes that are affordable and manageable. I think it's a must-have if you like cooking your own Chinese food in America."
4,Good addition to the series,"This is one of the better follow-ups to the original Hornblower saga. It has all the best elements of a Hornblower books: battles, strategy, diplomacy, etc. I felt the 'assassin' story was a little weak, but the rest is excellent."
4,Hornblower goes to the Baltic,"One thing I appreciate about the Hornblower series is how every book covers a different part of the world. I get to not only experience action and adventure, but I get to learn about the intricacies of naval battles in various climates and geographies. His adventures have taken him to the Pacific side of Central America, the coast of France, the West Indies, the Mediterranean, Spain, and now the Baltic. He even gets to experience land battles and a siege. He also exercises his diplomatic skills.This is a series that I have enjoyed immensely. I'm only sad that I am almost finished with this group of novels. Highly recommended, but should be read as after the other Hornblower novels in their historical order."
5,Outstanding book!!!,"This book is priceless when it comes to improving your oral board scores. This book helps to enlighten future firefighters on what the fire service is about and what you may expect as a rookie. Read it from front to back, and along with practice, it is almost impossible to not improve your oral boards."
4,Can't compare to similar products but it seems to work,"My dentist recommended a night guard but he recommends lots of expensive stuff so I was in no hurry to spend hundreds of dollars on one from him. I figured, for this price, it wouldn't hurt to try something. Based on the reviews for this product I decided to place an order. It took me two fitting attempts to get it ""comfortable"". I don't remember the exact instructions but I think two or three attempts might be all you get to get it ""right"". You have to boil it so I assume it loses some moldability with repeated dips into the hot water. Two guards, of different sizes, come with this kit."
4,Moruth Guard,This was for my daughter and it was great that it came with two sizes since she has a smaller mouth than most teenagers. It was easy to use and the cost was great.
1,Too thick for my mouth!,"I like that it came with two different sized mouthguards, I used the smaller of the two...however, the rubber or whatever it is made of is too thick for me to comfortably close my mouth so I have not used it at all..."
3,Not sure,"Being instruction-challenged, I'm just now following the instructions to ready the personal-fit mouth guard (by the way, the instructions were easy and worked). I slept with this mouth guard, for the first time, last night. It's a snug fit, and this morning, a couple of my front teeth felt sore. Though I'm not thrilled with the product, it's still better than the dental device my dentist sold me, for $250.00 (which I flung out of my mouth, during one night, and now can't find). I also plan to check out the one I keep seeing, advertised at Walgreen's, that is a no-boil. I think if I'd pressed more towards the back teeth, instead of the front, with this one, it would be fitting better. Some of my dissatisfaction may be my own doing."
5,Excellent product and price,"Considering my dentist wanted upwards to $600 for a guard, I'm quite happy with this guard. The larger guard molded perfect and fits fine. I purchased an extra one!"
4,Finally I found something that worked,"I've tried a dentist made custom splint (hated it), a mail order custom splint (caused TMJ pain), the Dentek Comfort Fit (fell out at night and would wake me up chewing on it - they honored their 30 day satisfaction guarantee), and the ""Aqualizer"", a ridiculous fluid-filled splint that broke the first night. Finally, I tried this cheap, and yes, large night guard. I was okay with it the first night, and it still works well a week later. It is softer than the custom acrylic splints, which is important for my grinding habits, which according to my wife are pretty severe. For less than 20 bucks, it's worth a shot. It worked for me. Good luck!"
2,Not that great,"I had another that was perfect but my dog got to it and thus had to find a replacement. (I know... enter joke here. :) ) This one works fine, but the thickness keeps my lips open and not the most beautiful if you are not sleeping by yourself. I found the seams a bit rough, which you have to sand down... It just is bulky in the mouth, even though, yes, it protects your teeth from grinding. There are better profiles out there..."
4,Dental Hygene Day/Night Mouthgaurd,A bit large/bulky to get used to. May require 2 fittings with the boiling phase.The clear plastic model is my preferred option.
1,not so good,This product is TOO big and bulky. It makes your lips stick out and flops around in your mouth. Very disappointed.
2,Does NOT work with a nightly retainer! Otherwise good I suppose.,"If you wear a nightly retainer, then this won't work for you. I tried molding both of the plastics to conform to my mouth with the retainer in it, and they don't work. I tried it again without the retainer, and it seemed fine. A big cumbersome either way, but I suppose someone could get used to that. But in any case, if I have to choose between my retainer and a night guard, then I clearly have a problem. Sadly, I had to return this product for that reason. Straight teeth trump keeping a cheap night guard any day."
3,Sleepless Night Guard,I attempted to use the Dental Hygiene Preferred Complete Day/Night Mount Guard -- without success. Two guards were included -- to accommodate large or small mouths. Process for forming to fit mouth was smooth enough -- however it was just too bulky to sleep with the guard in place.
1,Great looking.,The fit is great. But.... the buttons suck. You really have to work at it to make the side buttons work. Not worth it. Thumbs down as far as I am concerned.
4,A Helpful Guide,"Sociologist David Karp shares the insights gleaned from over 60 interviews of those who have loved ones suffering from the ravages of mental illness. He pieces together excerpts of these interviews to illustrate the different ways mental illness affects the lives of families and friends. Those interviewed share how they attempt to cope with such issues as personal feelings of guilt, the societal stygma associated with mental illness, and the frustration of dealing with a bureaucracy that is not always responsive. At the core of many of the interviews is a redeeming theme of hope. Karp's thesis is that the moral boundaries of caregiving necessarily shift as the mental illness emerges over time, and that it is imperative to balance the needs of the mentally ill person with the needs of those who provide care and support. Karp reminds readers of the 4 C's: (1) I did not cause it, (2) I cannot cure it, (3) I cannot control it, (4) all I can do is cope with it."
4,Well Done,"If you're looking to understand how to think about a friend or a loved one with major drug resistant depression or other mental health issues, you should read and refer to this work often. It provides insight on how to help with an appropriate outlook and attitude. Nicely done."
3,"Again, average work from B.S.","You know, people flock to her concerts just because of her over-publicized public image. She really isn't that great. On this album, I kinda liked the song ""Tell him"" although I only liked it because it was a duet with a singer with a MUCH BETTER VOICE, Celine Dion."
1,Gag Me With a Spoon!,Streisand is spiritual? That is the biggest laugh yet!Listening to this one will put you in a early grave.Yuck!
5,One of my favorite CD's ! Moving and inspirational.,"This CD is a great choice if you are a spiritually attuned person looking for music to both comfort and inspire you. Barbra's gorgeous voice, combined with all of the songs' moving lyrics and soothing yet inspiring melodies, make this CD a wonderful spirit-lifter. I have listened to it countless times since I bought it! However, I can see how some listeners could be turned off by the CD's predominant themes of God, spirituality, and interconnectedness. Listeners looking for plain old generic easy listening music had better listen elsewhere! But for those of us looking for the ""deeper meaning"" in life, this CD is a treasure!"
5,Great book,"Great book for background on Yank, the EM Magazine of the elicited men of world war two. A good read!"
2,"Fun, but NOT Jane Austen","I agree with Ms. Hurdle that the books are not up to the Austen standard in terms of irony. The bigger problem I have, though, is the character of Jane Austen. It does not convey a tenth of her biting humor or intelligence. But still, the books are fun to read as purely period pieces and for recognizing the characters from Austen's real life and fiction pop up in them."
2,WHAT?,i can understand all the morals and values this book puts forth but for the mayan part of it i do not understand. the book came in great condition and record speed.
5,"Selah, Hiding Place",This is a very uplifting CD with the best rendition of You Life Me Up of any I've ever heard!
3,Good General Information,"The information was good, but not technical. The section about PBXs discussed cost more then how they work. As a managerial tool, its not bad, but as an engineer, I found it lacking in technical information that I like to have. If you're looking for diagrams and formulas, look for something else."
4,"Grade A Content, C for Delivery","I'm new to telecom and bought this book to get up to speed. I must say first and foremost that I am getting up to speed.But right after that I have to say that I can't read more than 10 pages in a row without finding a glaring error. For example, the term ""jitter"" is defined twice in two pages. Why? Plenty of typos, some of the illustrations look like the postscript monster ate them, and the 1,000 pages could easily be condensed to 500-600 by getting rid of redundancy.For example, the difference between analog amplifiers and digital repeaters is defined around 5 times in the first 300 pages (with more or less the same illustration at least two of those times). So, yeah, I get the concept now and couldn't forget it if I wanted to, but I didn't need to be told so many times.All that said, if I would recommend this book to anyone new to telecom, but advise them to be gentle critics or keep their red pens handy."
5,Cute Beanie Baby,"My niece loves my 4 dogs, and tends to think they're actually her dogs. So when she visits she's always sad to leave my dogs behind. I thought for her birthday I would get her 4 little Beanie Babies that look like each of my 4 pups. All arrived quickly, and all look precisely like the pics. I have a long hair chihuahua, and none of the chihuahua beanies looked like her. So I opted for Poofie. She really is Poofie!! She's so fluffy you can't see her eyes! But she is a very very cute Beanie. All 4 beanies I purchased are the quality you'd expect with Ty, and the ear tags were in perfect condition (though I'll remove them since my niece will be playing with these). And they are small enough for my neice to hold in her hand and take to bed. Overall, I'm pleased with the purchase!"
4,"A really great follow up to ""Summer Light""",Elik finally comes to grips with her powers and Allanaq can now put his demons behind him. Can't wait for the sequal!
4,Lee Middleton Original Dolls Price Guide,"I found this book to be very useful in identifying several dolls in a collection I am trying to value. Since the guide was already 11 years, I only had a starting point. An updated price guide would be greatly appreciated."
3,Brother Brougham 10 Daisy Wheel,"One of the characters on the daisy wheel cracked shortly after I bought it, so I had to buy another one. Outside of that, it performs as it should."
5,The Commitments,"The music in this movie is great and worthy to be called great blues. The story is great and the actors are true to what Dubliners are like. If you have not seen it, rent it and I will be surprised if you do not get it for ""your movie library"" and also a cd as well !"
2,Commitments DVD Set,"While the discs look good and play well and the price was very reasonable, the outer cover on this collector's edition is very torn and looks awful. It affects the function of the binding on the nice outer cover wrapping. This was not advertised in item and if it had been, I would not have purchased."
3,"fun movie, great music",i enjoyed this movie and the music was fantastic. who'd have thought they could present this type of music so well.
2,Too many ingredients,I bought this book because I wanted to start using more soy products in my diet. Each recipe seems to have a long list of unusual ingredients. It would cost a bundle to outfit your kitchen with all of the exotic ingredients Deborah Madison seems to think you need to make tofu palatable. Mushroom soy sauce? She only uses 1 tablespoon--what am I supposed to do with the rest of it?
2,Not too impressed with the scope of this book for the price,"Yes I only paid $10.88 for it but it at least could have a few pictures of dishes to inspire one to actually cook and enjoy bean curd made by coagulating soy milk and gypsum, the same powdery stuff that they make the interior walls of houses out of!"
4,"Great Read, No Maps","This review is for the edition published by Book Jungle (The Story of The Malakand Field Force). The story itself is well-written and entertaining - the young Churchill was already confident, witty and sometimes eerily insightful. However, this edition does not contain any of the maps which Churchill meant to be included. They are not absolutely necessary to understanding the action, but they would certainly help, and it would be nice to have them. You should probably look for another edition..."
3,Lacking an important piece,"I enjoyed this soundtrack, but it would have received a higher rating if it would have included ""I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For"" by U2. In my opinion this was one of the major songs of the movie, and should have been inclued. Although I will say that unless this is the only song you wanted to listen to, the soundtrack is still worth buying."
3,"Great soundtrack, but I wanted more of the Irish tunes played during the movie","Don't get me wrong. The Pogues are wonderful have loved them for years, but the movie had a lot more great Irish music than this CD. The tunes are good stuff, but I really wanted more of a mix of the Irish and American that is present in the film itself.Rebecca Kyle, September 2008"
3,"Ok, but could have been better...","I looked for months to find this ""rare"" soundtrack only to be disappointed in that the U2 piece (played with Tommy Lee dancing around in his bomb factory) was absent. I don't know the name of that particular song but feel that the CD lacks substance and entertainment quality because of it."
5,Well written and interesting,"I purchased this book 10 years ago, and I still enjoy looking at it from time to time. Even though it is written for a wide audience, it is actually extremely well researched. This book definitely shows how many things that we consider the product of modern though are really just new spins on very old ideas."
5,Gregory Rummo Serves us Food for the Soul,"Perhaps if you took selections from several volumes in the Chicken Soup for the Soul series, you would come close to what Gregory J. Rummo has accomplished with his 'View From the Grass Roots.' This Award-Winning Columnist has compiled his first book, where we can travel with Gregory through Missionary work to Little League Soccer, and all points in between. Chicken Soup for the Soul with a dash of cayenne pepper. A must read selection!"
2,Piece of junk.,"Built to last? Are you kidding me? Not only is the bottom a felt material that will deteriorate and pill up on you, but the buttons are not very robust and mine stopped registering clicks after about a year of moderate use. No, this is a case of engineered obsolesence at the hands of our Chinese brethren. It's a complete rip off at even thirty bucks much less what they are asking here. But, when functioning it manages reasonably well...and what ar eyour other options?"
2,does not last,"This mouse operates just fine out of the box, but my second one is now dying the same way as the first. it starts doing random mouse clicking which is infuriating and can damage files you are working beyond repair in some cases. I will try the Intuos 4 mouse I suppose."
3,"Best import CD, quality sound and lyrics","I came across the CD in 1995 when I was studying in England. I bougth it immediately when I laid my eyes on it. I am crazy about Da Brat, she's beautiful, intelligent and has nice voice too. Her fast rhymes and rap tunes are well orchestrated and executed. Thanks to Jarmain Dupri of SoSoDef for unearthing such brilliant talent. They both make a perfect combination. I hope you'll come down to South Africa for the long awaited tour. We are starved of Hip Hop gigs down here. The only groups that ever come to our shores are R&Bs.I also like the remix album especially track no.1 and no.7 that features the late Notorius B.I.G."
4,no title,""" The machines men are so intent on making have carried them very far from the old sweet things.""This quote from the book sums up its core philosophy very nicely. Surely this is Anderson's best book, also depressing, but not as much as ""Winesburg, Ohio"", and quite sweet in its depiction of a life now lost. Anderson must have deeply loved the country and its farms to have described it so wondrously. And his skill in depicting even the most minute of characters is quite remarkable. This ability to draw out of the smallest things such vivid detail, is really outstanding. I liked this book very much and would almost wish to return to those ""old sweet things"". He really abhored the machine age and, as in ""Winesburg"", all his people, especially Clara and Hugh, are abysmal at trying to connect with their fellow human beings. Created with a lot of suspense."
2,Fey Tarot Book,"I have the Fey Tarot book without the cards, I have not been able to find the cards locally, I have ordered them now from amazon.com but my complaint about the book is Fey Tarot doesn't conform to the standard structure of a tarot deck. Any tarot book should be usable with any deck, but this book isn't usable with just any faery deck because the numbers and suits don't match a normal tarot deck. The meanings of each card is confusing and inconsistant."
3,good acting good script,Did not take long for the ghosts to show up. The jump-outs will make your heart beat fast.Share this with a friend.
4,Happy Review Time,Some Weeks Ago I Did A lot Of Reviews A Now I'am Doing A Lot More I Would To Just Have A Receipt Or Just A Book-in Section Then If You Want To Book-In Item And Still Have Review Section For Those Who Would Like To Write Do SoThank You
4,Update: Better software option,"As of march '03, there is absolutely no need to use either Rio Player or Moodlogic to manage the Rio Riot.Microsoft is now offering a free Powertoy applet called the Plus! Portable Audio Device applet (PlusPAD) which, in combination with a new driver from SonicBlue, lets you you the Windows XP file manager to manage the Riot; it shows up in the MY Computer Window as a system device, much like a Hard Drive. Double-clicking on the icon pops up a directory Window where you can sort the files by any of the ID3 tag attributes and copy or delete files by the usual cut-n-paste or drag-n-drop processes.As an extra bonus, the Riot-specific driver lets you manage the Riot from inside Windows Media player.Hence, no pop-ups, no nagging, no attempts to take over your PC.All you need are the latest drivers from Sonicblue and the MS-supplied applet.That's one less gripe about the Riot, no?"
4,"Excellent player, good price, a few little bugs.","I was impressed with the sound quality of the player. I love the menu interface as well. The battery system is a little buggy, but a simple download of the firmware upgrade solved that problem. The file loading is also greatly improved by simply downloading the Windows Applet for Mp3 devices."
4,Mixed Nuts,The actual player works like a dream. Very intuitive menu set up and the software works with little problems after the upgrade is installed. On the other hand the support on the website is horrid. The downloads dont work and the site seems more interested in selling their stuff and setting you loose for better or worse. I got an error each time i tried to download any file from the website. The only bad part of the player itself is that it is very large for an MP3 player. This isn't really too much of a problem when you consider that the massive hard drive holds more than many computer hard drives. I would reccomend this purchase only if you consider yourself good with computers and dont feel that updates are very important.
1,You doth protest too much,"Anyone who says keep me anonymous is called ""an electronics fan"". As one of those reviewers, I can assure you I do not work for a competitor, I am just a frustrated consumer who was relieved that a sympathetic store took my rioriot back. I, frankly, resent the accusation and find it a little suspect. Maybe some of you aren't having battery problems. I did with three units. And God help you if you EVER need to reach tech support. I still haven't had a reply to my last two e-mails that were sent over a month ago."
3,Don't want to be hasty,"I don't want to jump to conclusions, maybe my unit was an exception, but it lasted less than three full days before the on/off switch simply stopped working and my unit wouldn't turn on again. It worked great when it was going, and whether or not this represents bad workmanship or simply a rare exception I'm not sure. Just thought I'd post this in case someone else has the same problem."
1,Be Careful Before Purchasing This,I am so upset with this product I'm ready to throw it right in the garbage. I transferred all 20 gigs of my music from my other MP3 Player to this new Riot and now I'm [in trouble]. I deleted my music from the other player thinking that I now had it all on the new Riot. Well I do but you know what? Once it is on the Riot it's stuck and there is no way to get it off or transfer it back to a hard drive. I called their tech support and they said there is no way to get my music back. That is ridiculous considering the other 20 gig MP3 player I had was just a USB hard drive. So much better. And so much faster at transferring. This Riot is the slowest piece of garbage I have ever used. And you have to use Real Jukebox to transfer your files. There's no other choice. Whatever happened to open standards? My other MP3 Player even worked under Linux. This Riot is not worth the money at all. Go with another brand.
2,disappointing,"The Witches Master Grimoire was more of a dictionary on Witchcraft, with a large amount of love and binding spells. Not at all what I had expected, and nothing of any real worth. The sections on herbs was adequate, as was its information on incense and candles - but its nothing that a reader would not find in any of dozen other books that would have vast amounts of more useful information on other topics as well. I was disappointed in the book and would not recommend it."
4,Witch's Master Grimoire,"Though the book is wonderfully planned and laid out, I could only give 4 stars as the book seemed to be lacking in information. It felt as if it was set up for a begenner. Don't get me wrong, it is a wonderful book and I plan on keeping it in my own library for refrence and for my daughter, when she's old enough, however I fear it may not be the first book that comes to mind when I have a question. All the same, thank you, Lady Sabrina, for your efforts and your acomplishments. Brightest blessings."
3,Just a little too slow getting started,"Well, I almost gave up on this one several times. Partly - the format was daunting - those great big 8 1/2 x 11"" pages in Times New Roman 12 pt type!!! Yikes. I can barely recall the twists and turns of the plot at this point. What can I say??? Didn't love it."
5,A book for the beginner & experienced modeler,"Jeff Wilson really goes to town on the various styles of model railroad benchwork, including the pluses & minuses, then focuses a large chunk of the book on getting benchwork up in the grid style and L-girder. Jeff also explains the way to do a wall-mounted backdrop, fascia, double decking AND duck-unders, swing-outs for door openings, and all the tools you'd need to get any of these styles done. It is a MUST HAVE for any Model Railroader who wants to build the layout of his dreams!"
3,Arabic Laminated Transparent Keyboard,some kind of complication happend with my credit card & they sent me to rather update the info or add a new card so I added the new card & made a new purchase.they surprised me by making transaction with the denied card & the new one & ended up paying for same item 2 timesThe item itself was missing few alphabets & i ended up painting it myslef and stick it
1,Terrible,"I found this book to be overly complicated. The grammar, and vocab lists are hard to find. The book is very busy looking and hard to read. It also teaches you words that your grammar is not capable of using. I couldn't make a less functional lanaguage learning book if I tried. I would go out of my way not to use this.This is coming from a long time learner and somewhat skilled speaker/user of Japanese."
3,"Short, unoriginal text but nice reprints of a few drawings.","Useful mainly for the reproductions of the more popular drawings for those wanting prints to frame, this is now the only Leyendecker title in print. The Schau 1974 book, long out of print, is far better with more illustrations, although not as glossy. The book ignores the fact that JCL was gay and offers few of the many gay drawings and ads he did."
4,Not your normal war movie.,"Thank goodness the directors and producers let Robin Williams do a little improvising in this film. When Williams gets behind that microphone it is pure gold. Some of his crazy ramblings have become part of my vocabulary...much of this movie is highly quotable.The setting is the Viet Nam War, but the movie is not about the war itself. There are moments of culture clashes, government censorship, and pure hilarity.Although there are some tender and sad scenes in this film, the comic relief takes the sting out of the meloncholy moments.I gave this item a 3-star review, not for its content, but because I think this would be better rented than purchased."
5,Good Morning Vietnam,Wonderful. a lot of sense of humor. very sad and tragedy with a mixture of humor and love story. wonderful movie.
3,Great movie - choppy playback,"had to do the ol' ""go back a minute to trick the streaming software into playing the rest of the movie"" a few times."
1,one star is too many,"Robin Williams is a sweat act. This movie was a vehicle for Williams' stand up routine, and nothing more. No acting, just Robin Williams schtick."
3,only wireless option so its good enough,works well. battery life is good. occasional interference when using two at the same time. good range. sometimes buttons stick. i feel it was worth buying.
3,absolutely horrible,"I got this controller a few days ago and I already hate it. I thought it would be great because its wireless. That's probably the only great part about this controller. I play on expert, which requires a lot of hammer-ons and pull-offs, and with this controller, the action is MUCH slower. The buttons are a bit sticky and stay pressed down a split second after the note is released. This completely screws up my streak in the solos and basically any notes that are very close together. Also, the whammy bar is loose, causing it to face downward when I'm playing, so I hafta find the whammy bar every time a tail comes along. The strum bar also springs back too far sometimes, causing the note to be hit more times than intended. Oh, and the buttons are facing the wrong way (the round edges facing me rather than the ground). I'm most likely gonna sell this controller and get one of the wired controllers instead. They're more reliable."
2,Not Durable,"I have owned the white, black, and red guitars; and the red corded one is definatly the most durable. All of them started out great, i esspecially like the range of the wireless guitars, but the buttons are cheaper and the clicker wore out too quickly. I had to dig out my old red guitar because this white one randomly strums now without even touching the guitar. Overall this guitar is too pricy for it to wear out within a month. I would stick with the cord."
1,do not buy if you play expert!!!!,"When I purchased this guitar i was wicked excited to use it and thought it would be awesome. I was wrong, it is ok if you dont play on expert. I use to never fall songs and since ive gotten this guitar i havent beat a tough song on expert. The buttons push really hard which makes it really hard to play anything that is really fast. I am very disappointed and wish i would have bought a wired guitar!"
2,Description Discrepancy,"You can't always take what is written as the truth. This is the second guitar in a row that we have ordered that had vendor descriptions claiming compatibility with Guitar Hero 3, yet when the unit arrives it plainly shows on the packaging that it only works with GH 1 & 2. Looking back at the item today, the description has been changed to list only GH1&2, so I guess the mistake was caught and corrected since we ordered this one. I won't be trying for the third time being a charm. We've decided to buy locally."
5,Best Way to Play!,"I got this guitar when my friend who had the second guitar we played with moved away. Since I was the only one around with the games, and single player just isn't as fun with a group of people, I had to get something - I'm really glad I went wireless.Not being inhibited by the cord is really nice; you can get further away from the TV and REALLY rock out without worrying about pulling the Playstation 2 off wherever it is sitting, and you don't have to worry about contending with a strap AND a cord when passing the controller to a friend.The batteries that came with the guitar are still running great, and I've definitely used it (Rock the 80s and Guitar Hero III have both come out since I purchased this, so you know there has been some play time on it!)I have no complaints about this whatsoever. It's been one of the best purchases I've made for my PS2."
4,If you like NIN...,I definately recomend this CD. It is a must have for industrial and metal fans alike. Stabbing Westward has combined electronica with some guitar to create a very unique sound. It's melodies are mesmorizing and extreamly haunting. It's not something you want to listen to in the dark.
3,The Lengt of Baracelet,In the description I think the lenght of bracelet is important because some people have big tall and need this information before purchasing.
4,Archos Review,Good item. Everything works as advertised except battery life. Archos says you'll get 5.5 hours. You won't. Nobody that has this is geting more than about 4 hours of video on standard settings. That is my only complaint. Otherwise great unit.
5,Entertaining and a good read,"A great book for enthusiasts of golf history. Instead of laying out the story of the game in a linear fashion, the book is a series of essays along themes, among them ""Scotland,"" ""America,"" ""Equipment,"" ""The Early Tour Years,"" and ""Television."" Sprinkled in among the main chapters are personal essays by great writers of golf -- Rick Reilly, Dan Jenkins, Curt Sampson, Lee Eisenberg -- writing about subjects such as the golf pro, playing with better players, and the ideal golf hole.The book is breezy, entertaining, and full of great quotes about the simple joys and miseries of this wonderful game: ""The hole, in essence, is a seductress that juggles a golfer's heart and sould by trading on greed and fear"" and getting in touch with ""another, better teacher -- the one inside you, the silent pro, who is just dying to be consulted, if only you would pay attention for a change."""
4,Fun.,"What I like about this book, is that it doesn't have anything like stars according to how ""difficult"" it is to solve each problem. What really matters is how beautiful it is, how it makes one surprised. If you agree with me, get this."
5,Unlimited fun,"When I was just being to play chess, My cousin and I spent the whole summer with this book (1976). Once you pick it up, it is very hard to put it down. Excellent fun for the beginning and intermediate chess player. I run a chess club at work and I'm ordering this book in hope that they get as much enjoyment as I did from it. I still find number 999 very useful."
4,A Fun Change of Pace for the DS,"My daughter is the one in the family who has a DS. She liked this game because it was a change of pace from all her other ones. We did run into the letter recognition problem a little. I had more trouble with it than she did. It was almost like another puzzle figuring out how to make your letters just right for the game to recognize themUnlocking some of the games did take a little longer than we would have liked. I heard a few sighs from the back seat of the car because of this. I also agree that having the game pronounce the words would have been really cool.Overall this is a good game to add to your library. It's a great learning tool and a very good change of pace from normal video games. It had a few bugs, but not enough to ruin the game play."
3,For daily players,"I've only just received this game but i'm not all that excited by it. While it serves its purpose to increase your vocabulary, I don't particularly care for their ""play once a day"" set up. You have a daily goal of correct answers to reach while playing the various training games. Once you reach the daily goal, it doesn't count towards your ""expression potential"" anymore which is a bit of a downer to me. If you are looking for a fun word game that you can pick up and play any time, I wouldn't really recommend this game. If you are looking merely to learn some new words and only have a couple minutes a day to play I think it does its job. Doesn't inspire me to play."
2,Could be so much better,"It has potential, but falls way short. It needs pronunciations with the words - much like My Spanish Coach. It should also include part of speech in the definition, and at some point, should give you an example of the word being used. They need more games - some are just too tedious to do very often. It focuses more on spelling than on learning definitions. Nonetheless, both my husband and I have persisted through the game for two months and have both reached a point where our expression potential has not updated for three weeks of daily play regardless of the fact that we have reached our word quota almost every day. I hope UBI Soft will put some more time into this game and make the improvements necessary to make it both useful and fun."
3,four boys named jordan,"cute book. like the rhyming. didnt like the line about dont try to be friends with a jordan because you will only get into trouble. my daughter's name is jordan and since we read the book, she doesnt want to be called jordan anymore!!"
5,great basic stapler from swingline,"The 407 is a light office duty stapler, handles about 9-10 sheets comfortable. Also dependent on staple brand as well. A good model for my uses."
1,DON'T BUY THIS,"I bought two of these. Both of them broke. Apparently, there is a problem with the recharging device. It overheats easily, and disrupts the internal hard ware. Do not buy this. Archos does not even live up to its warranty."
2,"Hard to Search, Hard to Run","I bought this item when it almost first came out. I paid almost $$$ for it and was expecting a good product. When I installed the software, put songs on a playlist, and tried to send them to the device through the software, it didn't work, so I used my computer to send them there insted. When I went through the instruction mannual, it had no resolution for. I also had a computer programer look at it and he couldn't get it to work. Also, I find it to take a long time to go to another song if you are in the middle of one already. The last thing I will say about this is that with the capacity of this machine, it should have a search device like iPod or the RioRiot. Those machines may cost more, but it is definetly worth it in the long run."
2,Very Dissatisfied,I bought this product as a gift for my wife. The instructions are quite unsatisfactory and it required a lot of guess work to get it up and running. However although the file transfer procedure was relatively simple the Sound output was very very dissapointing. I hardly could hear MP3's which normally are very audible even at mid level volumes in other players. I would definitely advise against it.
2,Mediocre at Best,"The primary reason I bought this product was that Amazon had it for only $$$ after rebate. At that price the product is a good deal, especially in comparison to the ipod. It's twice as thick as the ipod and quite a bit heavier.However, don't be fooled by into thinking that's it's the poor man's ipod, because there are a number of shortcomings:- itunes interface works, but it doesn't hide the "".xxxx"" files when browsing.- the USB interface is incredibly slooooow.- my unit had some visual defects- the documentation, s/w, and website are not kept up to date. It's as if the product was discontinued.- when it's hooked up to USB it doesn't turn itself off. It also doesn't indicate the batteries are dead during the transfer of files. You just get errors.Reasons to buy:- price (possibly)- size, although bigger than the ipod, it's smaller than the nomad.I gave it 2 stars based on price. If it had been more, I would have rated it a one."
1,It [is bad],"This product [is bad]. It's fragile. I downloaded the latest firmware and after a day, it says Ic 2 Error when I turned it on. Try to get in contact with the tech support. Got in touch with the answering machine saying they would call back. What kind of tech support is this? And after all, the device [is bad]. It's a cheap kind. Looks like its only good for portable hard drive storage. If you are for that, well.... suit yourself."
4,This is a great Maginize!,"This is a terrific mag.! It's awsome! Bloopers, pictures, and games! Ok send me LOTS of messges cause' I LOVE e-mailing BYE!"
4,It's ok....,"Discovery Girls is kinda bad. I'm a 11 and I wana know bout celebs, music, movies and fashion. They seem to think fashion is wearing pink and putting little clips in ur hair. If ur 8-10 its perfect, but for those of you who are 11 and up, try something a little more grown up. But overall this mag is OK, i must say its better than american girl though."
2,Teaching lying,Loved this highly commercial magazine until it actually printed a feature on how to lie to/and hide things from your parents. For 8 year olds!!! I don't think so.
1,Have not received,We have not received the magazine so it is ibpossible to review. Please let us know when we can expect to receive it.
1,THIEVES! haven't received one issue,"i ordered six months ago and have not received any issues. i will never pay for a magazine subscription again. waste of money! do yourselves a favor: if you want any magazines or newspapers, order them digitally. it's the only way you can be sure of getting them."
1,Yawn,"This magazine really bored me. Where do i begin. I think if your around the age group of like 8 or 9, (and your a girl) you will LOVE this magazine, but once you hit 11 through 13, it's boring!"
5,Large face and quiet,"This clock is thin, light, and QUIET and has a large face. Too many of these small clocks, especially when placed on a solid surface, make an amazing amount of noize with each tick. This is effectively silent. The only downside is the dials for setting it are small and recessed so they don't accidentally shift; just a bit difficult to access. Luminous hands, but no light. Snooze alarm. It's cheaply, but adequately made, all plastic. Perfectly utilitarian."
3,Dark and Sombre... Gigantor? Is that you?,"Sheesh, this is a slow moving but somehow creepily effective bunch of animations. A lot about the dark days for Japan after WW2, and the big robot is teasingly hidden in mummy shrouds a lot of the time - but he looks good when he finally gets out and about. I loved Gigantor as a little kid, and this is a lot more like Frankenstein. In fact, there is another monster you'll meet called the other Tetsujin, who is a cross between the Hulk and Frankensteins's monster - quite an emotional chap too. His bellows of anguish are unintentionally humorous. It is all carefully played out, with a Sigourney Weaver sound-alike narrator, but I just wnated some old fashioned giant robot antics a lot of the time. Dr Franken is a great looking evil character, and his name does remind me of something- can't put my giant metal finger on it though..."
3,Good and Bad News.,"I agree that this book is comprehensive and entertaining -- when discussing the people involved. However, it is often laughably garbled and sometimes dead wrong in explaining the phenomena those people discovered and worked on. Enjoy the people; take the science and technical explanations with a large grain of salt. Two examples out of many: 1)The author says that parallel current-carrying wires repell each other. That's true if thecurrents run in opposite directions, but the wires attract each other if the currents run in the same direction. 2)The author says that the dark surface that forms in a light bulb is caused by electrons, but it is a coating of metal that has boiled off of the filament."
2,Entertaining,"I agreee with K.O. Edwards that this book contains far too many inaccuracies to be taken seriously. Since the author confuses and misrepesents technical facts, I am hesitant to accept his charaterization of the ""inventors"" who brought us the wonders of electricity and electronics. TB"
2,Much as promised - but hard disk crashed after 3 months,"The function of the machine was much as billed. The audio was a bit noisy, especially with the power supply connected. Also a few minor bugs in the firmware.However, the hard disk crashed after 3 months normal use. I like the function but I won't buy another one with a 30 day warranty!"
3,One gripe with this product. You may find it big or small..,"I found this product very easy to use. Transfering songs was simple, the capacity allowed the songs to be of the highest quality, while still fitting my entire collection.The complaint I have with it, is that it skips. Often. Almost every song would skip."
5,My Archos and I.......,"I have been thinking about MP3 players for a long time. At first i thought i would buy the MPIO DMG PLUS, then the Archos came up. Immediately i saw that I must have that. I have had it for 3 days now, and nothing has gone wrong. The software is easy to install, you can carry your WHOLE CD collection in your pocket. Now the downside.... A) It takes 10 hours to charge the batteries, B) You can't tell when you have transferred a song to it, C) it weighs alot, D) it takes a long time to turn it on, and E) the headphones supplied aren't good. Anyway I love my Archos, and where I go, my Archos comes with me."
1,TERRIBLE,"This was supposed to be a new book, it was not. The label said new the description said new. Long story short is that I opened book and pages were wrote on, tables were filled out, and questions were answered. Will never buy from this provider again"
3,brenda k starr /atrevete a olvidarme,BRENDA K STARR /ATREVETE A OLVIDARME CD.THIS IS A BAD CD.I LOVE BRENDA K STARR MUSIC.I HAVE ALL THE ALBUMS BUT THIS IS FAR FROM THE THREE FIRST ALBUMS SHE FIRST RELEASED.IT IS A TOTALLY DIFERENT STYLE .IT IS MORE POP THAN ANYTHING FAR FROM WHAT SHE REALLY IS AND HER MUSIC IS ABOUT I HAVE BEEN BUYING MUSIC ALL MY LIFE.I WILL SUGGEST TO WHOEVER IS READING THIS REVIEW AND IS THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS CD.THINK ABOUT IT BEFORE YOU BUY IT.IT IS NOT THE SAME BRENDA WE KNEW.LISTEN TO IT FIRST BEFORE BUYING IT IS A SUCKY CD.THREE STARS.
4,Decent Single,"The Shut Me Up single is far better than MSI's last single, the Straight to Video Remixes. The reason why the SMU single is better is because:1.) Shut Me Up is, in my opinion, a far better song than Straight to Video.2.) Only three remixes of the song, unlike how the Straight to Video CD has 15.3.) The original ""crappy demo"" of the song, which is almost as good as the final version.4.) Two new songs! The cover of Notorious BIG's ""Big Poppa"" is hilarious, and is reminiscent of the band's ""Bring the Pain"" cover on Tight. ""Adios Amigos"" is alright, but hard to understand at times.My only problem with the single is that the third Shut Me Up remix is not very enjoyable, and there are two remixes of Straight to Video. Although the remixes are decent, didn't we already get more than enough on the actual Straight to Video single?"
3,Underrated Jerry,"Director Jerry Lewis' cynical, reflexive look at show-biz phoniness has grown in stature during the past 20 years. ""The Patsy"" (1964) features several hilarious routines from the King of Crazy - interspersed with some excruciatingly painful moments. A stronger-than-usual cast includes Ina Balin, Everett Sloane, Phil Harris, Keenan Wynn and Peter Lorre in his final screen role. Ed Sullivan's outrageous cameo is worth the price of admission. No match for ""The Nutty Professor"" (1963), yet one of Jerry's most intriguing films."
4,Perhaps For Lewis Fans Only!,"This is not Jerry's best work but still there are plenty of sight gags to go around to give his fans something to laugh at! I can understand why there seems to be a sharp divide on his comedy style....he's in your face and not the least bit subtle, although when you look at his comedic routines in this you can see there was a great deal of thought put into them.Jerry plays Stanley, a clumsy and socially awkward bellboy who falls into the hands of record and movie producers who are at odds after losing their ""Cash Cow"" in a plane accident. They pick unsuspecting Jerry to fill his shoes and continue their success. WHY??? So there would be a movie, that's why!I think the word, ""Zany"" was invented for Jerry, so you can sit back and enjoy the mayhem, I'm sure you'll find something to make you smile!"
5,The Patsy,"This is another of Jerry's really great movies! He is really good in this. This movie is one where you want to get a nice bowl of Popcorn and watch it, because it is wonderful! He is a one of a Kind....Thank you, Jerry! And thank you to Amazon!"
3,Battery Issues,"I've tried 2 sets of rechargeable batteries, and even the Rockbox software (which is WAY better than the standard O/S). I've NEVER gotten more than 2 hours of usage before it stops playing since it can't spin up the hard-drive. I'm sure there are some units without this battery issue, but even charging the batteries outside the unit and then putting them back isn't giving me the 8-10 hours I'm supposed to get. If you buy one, cross your fingers you get a good one. Otherwise, I LOVE this thing and it always works perfectly when plugged in to AC power."
5,This is a GREAT Jukebox,This is an great jukebox! It is very easy to use and move music to and from. It is just like having an external hard drive you can drag and drop music too. The 20 GB size makes it almost hard to fill up with music! It comes in handy and the battery life is great! Would highly recommend if you like taking a lot your music with you!
3,good but has serious problem in voice recording,"Actually, I bought this product to record and tostore my personal data. I admit that it's fantasticas a storage tool. But, I was so embarrassed to findthat I could not use it as a voice recorder.Every one minute, the harddisk turns with noisy sound.Because it does not have the function of outer mic,that noise comes into the recording.I'm sure that you can never want to use it to recordvoices."
3,Silly nonsense,"I'm a big fan of Emmanuelle Beart and her part in this movie was pretty good. She didn't have to speak except for a couple of sentences right at the end. The rest of the cast were terrible, but who can blame them. The idea of the movie offers so many opportunities for cleverness and hilarity, but this hardly materialises. They were a couple of good themes and some sparsely scattered funny moments.At least for Beart it was a much better part than her one in Mission Impossible.If you like movies like ""Splash"" and ""Mannequin"", you will only be half disappointed by this one."
1,Did not work once,"I tried this with a simple 100 Watt light bulb and it wouldn't even power it up. I tried several different small appliances and they all held the same results. It would just make an annoying, high pitched screech and the green light would turn red. I hope this was just a fluke but this one was DOA. Have not had time to see about returning it yet."
4,Really enjoyed this book!,"""Torchlight"" was well-written and I especially loved the description of the diving. This book is a cross between Clive Cussler and Tom Clancy. We get thrills, diving and interesting political insights. I definitely look forward to the sequel!"
3,Predictable,"As a scuba diver, I loved the underwater descriptions. However, the rest of the plot was boring, predictable,and somewhat ridiculous."
4,A readable guide to better writing,"I bought this book because I had no real choice not to. It was after all required by the teacher of a required English class. Much to my surprise I found it be a well organized, easy to read book that presented an approach to developing writing skills that I think I will think will help me develop writing skills without the usual pain. The book gives examples of the skill they want to develop then guides you through writing exercises designed for that skill. This is helping me to focus on each area in turn. I like the book. I am not usually a big fan of English books but this one will stay on my self long after the class is over."
4,Basics on writing,"Overall, a good book for a college writing class. The one knock I have on the book is the absence of an APA style sample essay. There is an MLA cited paper in the book. Why?"
4,Great text delivered in a timely fashion,"I purchased this text to replace one that I'd lent to a student. The publisher wouldn't give me another ""desk"" copy of such an expensive book. This book is in mint condition, and I paid four times more for shipping than I did for the book itself. I'm very pleased."
2,Basic,"Basic in its approach to writing, this book may be useful for high school English classes but is totally unsuitable for college students. Although it contains some worthwhile fiction, most of the non-fiction pieces are not very challenging for college readers. The text is extremely prescriptive, and leads students to write formulaic papers rather than original and creative college level essays."
1,"""Dogfights"" is worst warplane series, pure propaganda.","I've collected historical and military documentaries for over 40 years and this is without a doubt the worst fake historical-documentary series that is in fact propaganda that I've seen in English. Worse, it is the ONLY series I've seen in ANY language that not only omits the 'Battle of Britain' and Spitfire, but shows such a one-sided, American/Israeli-biased series. If the RAF is mentioned it is to prove how great Americans & Israelis were in comparison to them.If there was fuel to the rising criticism of the owners of the History channels recently producing unprofessional and unethical propaganda programming, this is it.This is the only series I wouldn't even accept as a gift to be beer coasters."
5,Great Dogfights,"This series is so well done, you can't stopping watching until it's it over, so be in sure and taking care of any thing else before you push play. It also has a plus for me, as they detail the movements so well, I've done much better when flying simitation (IL2 1946) and I can transfer the moves directly to the simulation and usually come out better than I used to do. I intend to purchase all the seasons and I highly recommend you do too, for those times when you have all the cable channels on and nothing worth watching."
4,"Good power, god materials, nice feel....made in China","Very nice saw. The blade was practically 90 degrees out of the box, and it feels good in my hand. I didn't have any problems with binding either due to the depth of cut or the blade cover, and it seems to spin rather freely. I like the brake as well, my previous saw didn't have one. One star gets knocked off because they used to make their good stuff here in the States, but this one's made in China. I returned a Milwaukee 6390 because the left handed blade would continually bind since the blade guard was specifically made for the left handed cut instead of being right hand viewing capable. That one was made in Mexico. Do any tool manuafacturers make their stuff here anymore? Sigh..."
2,Check the alignment.,I checked this saw out at the local big box store and it seemed very well made. The floor model was made in Japan so I bought it. When I got it home I checked the alignment of the blade and it was out by about 3/32 front to back. Also this one was made in China. I brought it back in favor of the Milwaukee. Other than that it seemed like a nice saw.
4,Nice little primer,"Zen Meditation: Plain and Simple is an excellent little primer on how to sit in zazen. Also covered are the basics of Buddhism and Zen. The instructions are easy to understand, and the explanations are concise if slighly dry.The only drawback is that the pictures showing the positions are in black and white, and the model is wearing dark clothing and socks. This makes it very difficult to tell the difference between the Lotus and Half Lotus positions if you don't already know.The book stresses persistance, and that ""anything brought up by zazen can be solved in zazen"". It is a simple, fairly undogmatic approach to the practice of meditation."
5,Understand what it was like for Tony to be Tony!,"I picked up this book on the offhand chance it would tell me for sure or not if Tony was in Gleaming The Cube, a skate movie with Christian Slater (I had a bet with my wife). Anyways, I ended up reading the whole thing cover to cover. I didn't know how interesting his life really was. Tony is his own worst critic though. Never was dry or dull reading. Great book."
2,"Geared for Experts, too much footage, not enough instruction","I'm an intermediate to advanced skiier, looking for tips to take it to the next level. Although the instruction in this video is definitely geared towards high-end experts, I still found much of it to be useful. My major complaint is that the video spends too much time showing typical warren miller 'wow' footage and not enough time explaining their instructions. I would have liked a little more explanation and examples to go along with each of their points."
3,"Love Tony, but...","I love Tony Bennett, and he is one of the last of the great crooners (Andy Williams and Al Martino are the only ones I can think of, since the passing of Perry Como). However, this CD, while great in that it introduces a new generation to pop standards, is lacking in several aspects. First, admittedly, Tony's voice isn't what it used to be. Secondly, the audience noise, for this type of concert, is rather distracting. And, last, to include k.d. lang and Elvis Costello on an album of this type brings the entire CD down a couple notches. This is not their type of music, and they show it.If you are really looking for a great Tony CD...look to his earlier output. Get this, only if you're a completest."
2,Nice material but zipper hell..,"Owned it for a month before the zipper started giving me problems. Zipper teeth come apart for no reason. Material is good, but don't expect to zip it and have it stay zipped."
4,Mary Anne is Hero!,"I thought this was a pretty good book, but when they fight over who gets to baby sit Lucy Newton that's what I didn't like about it. I thought Mary Ann had good judgement When Jenny got sick. Also I thought it was pretty cool when Mary Ann tried to get her friends back together, and made a new friend in the process."
4,Mary Anne really did saved the day!,"Mary Anne has always been one of my very favorite character. This book has a great beginning, middle and end.Mary Anne has always want to be the leader. She had fought a little but got ruined by her friends saying mean things. it was sad when they had a fight, but it really let you want to read more.When they had a fight, it really let you taste each character's personality. All of them are quite strong, but the strongness are different. That's what I like about this book. Every character are different but sometimes same. The book discribed it well enough to let you understand.I like the ending. I wonder was this book based on someone! (Especially that Jenny P, the spoilled kid.)I can't help laughing when Mary Anne cries!The only way you are going to know the personality of each character and the trouble they each bring (or pleasure) is to READ THE BOOK!"
2,light guage,This product was returned. I would guess it is 29 guage.It was replaced with Dee Zee rails that are of a heavier guage.
1,vincent longo,"Just a couple words it is the worst lipstick I've ever had! Not worth it, besides it smells terrible. I am dissappointed."
3,Britcoms Rule,This is an excellent book to whet your appetite for more news/trivia about Britcoms. Thoroughly enjoyable. Just what Ithought I wanted when I was looking for it.Love it.
3,Small but good!,"I love this mouse. I can just sit in a chair or recliner with my laptop without having a hard surface to roll a mouse on. Although the finger hole is smaller than i expected, so i click the button sometimes when i dont want to. Other than that it is a great mouse."
4,Great for off-desk computing,"I got one of these about a year ago for use with my laptop, which I often use in the living room in an easy chair. Sure, trackballs aren't for everyone, especially when thumb-driven, but really, folks, it's not that hard to get used to.I've had to clean out under the ball a few times, but not really anymore so than with a conventional mouse. The trigger button gets a little tricky after prolonged use - it seems the spring is dead or dying. That's my only complaint with it, and a little side-to-side shake once in a while keeps it going, though I am about to buy another one."
2,Replacing Already,"I am getting ready to send this back to Amazon or Fellowes. I have not even had it a month and I have a number of problems. At first it was great. But 2 weeks later it suddenly stopped moving right or moving down on the screen. Bad thing is there is no rhyme or reason, so it happenes at any time. The worst thing I have experienced is it will lock the page in a kind of automatic scroll down position. I cannot do anything on the page unless I use my touchpad or keypoard. Then the Fellowes magically unlocks and I can use it again. I'm bummed because there seem to be few of these on the market...maybe there is a reason. I hope the 2nd one works!!"
2,Pretty unmemorable stuff.,"I thought hard about what was wrong with this film and came to the conslusion that it just isn't very funny. It has its moments and early scenes show promise with Stan and Ollie turning an air raid wardens' meeting into a fiasco and then making a mess of a dummy-run, but all too soon you're longing for the days of Hal Roach. King of slow-burn Edgar Kennedy is under-used and the plot seems to drift aimlessly throughout the later parts of the film until it reaches a rather limp conclusion.If you're a fan of Laurel and Hardy who can't find any of or have seen all their better films then this is worth a look. Otherwise don't bother."
5,Two boys' review: Another great bedtime book for my little bears,"Along with ""Little Bear"" we have this book on my sons' bookshelf and read it often as part of our bedtime routine.My two sons (5-year old and 4-year old) have enjoyed this book now for a couple years. They see themselves as ""little bears"" and enjoy adding their own imagination to the book's storylines.This book introduces a new character, Emily, and reinforces wonderful messages of friendship and sharing that were introduced in ""Little Bear.""The book is a classic and you can add it to your storybook collection with Amazon's 4-for-3 special offer. I suggest you also pick up ""Little Bear"" (see my review)."
5,A childhood treasure waiting to be discovered,"As a little girl in the early 1960's, Little Bear's Friend was one of my favorite books. What a joy to discover that this old friend is still available for my three year old daughter to enjoy!"
5,Still a profound challenge,"Kit Williams created a beautiful golden, bejeweled hare, which he buried somewhere in England in 1980. He then created a picture book of his own artwork. Each picture hid both clues and false leads indicating the location of the buried jewel, and anyone was invited to seek after it and keep it for himself. Though the prize was found about a year later, the picture book remains one of the most challenging puzzles accessible to the ordinary person and is vastly entertaining in its own right."

1,Does not appear to be terribly effective in Tucson,"Had the SB002 turned on in my shirt pocket while working outside around dusk. Was bitten twice in about 10-15 minutes--on the arm and on the leg--before going inside. (By the way, Tucson mosquitoes are extremely stealthly--no noise and they are gone by the time you feel the bite.) So far the SB002 has not been protecting me as expected."
5,A steller album from a great songwriter - one if his best!,"This CD is a classic, and there are more where this came from from McMurtry. McMurtry is a poignant storyteller, his gravelly, road-worn voice leading songs that range from roadhouse stomps to contemporary folk tales. McMurtry is a talented poet, has a lot to say and he appears to be never far from his Telecaster, thank God. This CD offers a classic sound, no pretension. And you have to love a guy whose road band is called The Heartless Bastards. GENRES: Rock, Mellow Rock, Americana.BUY IF YOU LIKE: Lucinda Williams, The Jayhawks, Neil Young.MUST HEAR TRACKS: ""Rachel's Song,"" ""Fuller Brush Man,"" ""Levelland,"" ""Iolanthe."""
1,Not worth any precious time,"This is a nothing movie with a nothing story that feels and looks like a bad high school play. The cute guys by themselves do not make the movie interesting or compelling. I'd avoid this completely, and certianly rent it first if it looks interesting to you. I think you'll be disappointed."
2,ScornCursed,"Bad acting, bad dialogue. Another interminable exposition of a coming out story, told by the whining writer character to the straight guy he is so transparently trying to seduce.Luckily I pressed eject on the remote control 20 minutes after it started., because if I had both hands free I may have clawed my eyes out.There are better short films available for free on You-Tube."
5,great,"This is a great buy. Works great because it allows you to charge more then one device, as long as its not the same device. The fact the one end is a usb connection is very good because if you have any accesories that are usb compatiable you can use that too. Example- I have a car charger for my ipod that has a usb connection, so I can use that same car charger to charge my sons ds lite. it is great!"
5,How this book changed my life.,"This book explodes the myth of Darwinian evolution on the basis of its profound improbability. I have read many treatises on the subject of evolution. None bring to the table such a simple yet thorough exploration of the subject. Reading this text destroyed my doubts in the Bible's Creation Story. Since reading it, I converted to Christianity and have since become a minister."
3,Fine Summaries With A Dose Of Salt.,"For a brief book 238 pages this was fairly well written. The reader should be cognizent that this came out in 1972. The authors premise that wars, plagues, and famines feed each other is certainly true. At times the author narrated these beliefs without going deep enough into the details of the ""hows."" But, he did demonstrate how Athens and Rome were weakened far more by disease than from invaders. I thought the first three chapters were the most convincing. 1-Disease in the anc. world, 2-the black death, 3-The mystery of syphilus. The last ch. Man made problems of the present and future jumped from one topic to the next. Yet, he pointed out problems that have actually come to fruition today. This book provides good food for thought."
2,"Well-researched, not well-written","The authors clearly put lots of work into researching and referencing the topics. However, I felt the urge to keep a red pen in my hand and correct the position of commas and try to decide where the next paragraph should have started. How could such a tediously prepared work have been so poorly proof written?"
4,Bad Ending....but the rest was nice,I loved this movie until the dissapointing and depressing ending! I've never read the book but does it have a different ending. Kevin Costner was very good in it and should be praised but the rest (besides the ending) was lovely. If you want to watch a movie that is a tear-jerker (and I mean TEAR-JERKER) this is your kind of a film.
2,Huge disappointment,"Not only was every step of this love story predictable, the unnecessarily tragic ending ruined what would otherwise have been an entertaining movie. Indeed, life is sometimes tragic; all the more reason to give us a happy ending. If you're looking for a ""feel good"" movie, please don't press play on this one."
5,"Charming, entrancing, romantic and bittersweet",You have to see this movie. The music is perfect as well as the actors chosen for the roles. Wonderful acting!
1,Skip the movie-read the book!,"I am a huge fan of Nicholas Sparks' novels. His books center around tragedy. With that being said they are definitely tearjerkers. I loved the movie adaptations of The Notebook and A Walk to Remember, but this one was terrible.When there is a movie version of a book, I tend to read it first and this was beyond the worst novel to silver screen adaptation. I know I shouldn't expect it to be just like his book, but too much of it was changed (including my favorite part-the ending). It was so disappointing. Even though it may not be the shorter route to take (since it is quite long), my advice is to read the book."
5,DVD as a Christmas gift,"The DVD/Movie arrived quickly, packed well and the wrapper was unbroken. My wife has not watched it yet, but she really wanted this film."
5,LOVE IT,Quentin Tarantino is insane. I mean that in the most respectful way. The dialogue in his movies is genius. Just awesome. I love everything this guy puts out. The soundtracks are perfect too.
1,Overrated,"Quentin Tarantino has to be the most overrated filmmaker out there. This movie had 2 minutes that really hooked me as a viewer, and that's the scene between the ""wrong direction"" and the accident, without spoiling it for future viewers. Other than that, the rest of the movie was horrible. Tarantino makes his movies popular by shocking the viewer with unpleasant scenes. That is all he can do. That's why everyone loves his trash. This movie had about 2 minutes of that, and the rest was a bunch of girls talking about their tepid sex lives. I realize this review won't get many ""helpful"" reviews, but I wasted $5 on a rental as a Mopar buff hoping I would like the car scenes. Seeing the destruction of a few old mopars did not make up for anything. I just don't understand the attraction to Tarantino films. The people who like his stuff probably like faces of death."
5,"Incredible, Incredible, Incredible","Man, I can't believe the amount of people that miss the point of this amazing movie. I guess I benefit from being exposed to many a drive-in movie while growing up (Including one of my fav's, Dirty Mary Crazy Larry).Even if you don't have the patience to just embrace the experience that Tarantino has so beautifully crafted, how can you NOT be blown away by the jaw-dropping set pieces: the lap dance; the car chase.Sorry, you won't find this kind of stuff on YouTube, if that's what you're basing your opinions on. Hey I'm glad to be in the minority here, b/c I think Robert Rodriguez sucks and so many people loved sin city."
2,"Tarantino's worst, by far","I was truly dissapointed by this film, especially after the punch that Kill Bill I and II packed. It seems as if Tarantino decided that since he has released a handful of pop culture gems, it gave him the license to indulge in some of his worst tendencies. In the end, the film seems like a rough draft. The characters are not developed, the dialouge is not particularly fresh, and the action (although many will argue is edge-of-your seat) is really rather mundane. The ending was particularly ridiculous. I hope Tarantino gets back on track on his next project, because this is a dud. The cover of the DVD clamis that it is his most quotable movie since Pulp Fiction. Honestly, I don't think I can quote a single line from it."
5,Works great,"Well I got it on time which is really good, but see what I don't get is how is it ""Unrated"" it was the same as in theaters, which ain't your fault and I ain't blaming you lol. But yeah great movie/quality"
1,Truly awful,"I thought this film would be fun, but I had expected it to be an homage to the old flicks like The Car. Instead we have a boring bunch of incredibly foul-mouthed and brainless women interminably babbling, and finally, at the end, a distasteful car chase with (spoiler) a woman on the hood of a car. It even manages to make Kurt Russell seem gross. Yech! I loved Tokyo Gore Police, but this is so much of a mess that it's not even campy. I can't believe I watched all the way through to the end."
3,A Separate Release??,"I don't understand why the studio decided to release this film as two separate films. After the release of this film old Grindhouse movies from the 70's began being released which actually have TWO films per single disc. The total running time of the theatrical version was about 3 hours with awesome trailers mixed in. It isn't a Grindhouse experience unless both films are integrated. The theatrical version was so much fun, this was a huge mistake on the part of the studio. But I'll bet you a million bucks in about 6 months we'll see the film re-released in theatrical version. 1 disc with both films and 1 disc with extra features.What were you people THINKING?!"
1,just buy planet terror,This movie was not worth 20 bucks it's only redeaming feature was the scene with the first group of women and the ensuing car crash the rest of the film is boring overly talkative and a waste of time no wonder they didnt relase deathproof and planet terror together it would have ruined it
1,QUENTIN TARANTINO AT HIS WORST!!! IT SUCKED!!!!!!!!,"Like everybody else, I tought that this movie would be GREAT because it was directed by Quentin Tarantino!! BUT IS PURE GARBABE!!!!!The movie itself is PURE BORING BLAH,BLAH,BLAH!!! 90% of talking and 10% of action!! I think this movie is for girl because of the conversations and the STUPID ending!!! The ending was the only action scene and it wasn't THAT cool! I seen a lot of feminist movies but this one is definitely the WORST!!! If you want feminism watch: The Luc Besson movies, I Spit on your Grave or Kill Bill!Pulp Fiction is the best film of Quentin Tarantino, Kill Bill was COOL, Resevoir Dogs was GREAT, Jackie Brown was so-so and this one is the WORST!!!I don't care if this movie is a tribute to the 70's car movies! I saw Grand Theft Auto (1977) and it was MUCH BETTER this piece of s*&^!!!Sorry! but this movie is Quentin at his worst!!Adios."
2,Too Much Already,"I like Tarantino films, but he's beginning to recycle a bit too much. He used to take the best bits from classic film noir, ninja flicks, anime, 1940s crima drama, anime, and exploitation films of the 70s and turn the pieces into something new. But in Death Proof he's started recycling...himself. The film is predictible in its overblown largesse of violence and kitsch. *yawn*"
1,Rip-Off Alert!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Grindhouse was ONE MOVIE THE CONTAINED TWO STORIES!!I loved Grindhouse and have been looking forward to the DVD release and I cannot beleive that they are doing this.The film did not do well at the box office so why not release it to the only ones who care.. the Fans! Dont split it in two!! I hope no one buys this and gets a bootleg copy of the real movie. This stinks!
3,"""Not Bad!""",Kurt Russell and more star in Quentin Tarantino's 2007 action thriller.Young women are hunted by a psychotic stuntman who uses his carto kill people. This isn't bad and Kurt is great as usual. This dvd hasgood picture and sound plus neat extras. I recommend this.
1,greedy dogs!,i had heard they were going to split this movie up for it's release on DVD and hoped it was just a bad rumor but hey maybe quentin really needs the extra 20 million. I won't buy it until they release both films for one low price. Don't care how long it takes.
1,Kind of a disappointment,"The movie has a big problem in that it is not involving as PLANET TERROR, and seems misogynistic.The flow of the film seems sluggish, and the events unrewarding. There's no real big pay off. And the lead character is a sleazebag who isn't interesting and his moral core nonexistant."
1,Is this a joke?,"I don't get it. If anybody else made a movie this long about nothing, it would be destroyed by everyone. Russel tries to save this. He is able to do it in the shorter version. In this one...no chance.I miss the original. By the way the graineyness (not sure if that's a word) blows...yet another thing that worked much better in the movie theater.Release the original release in it's entirety. I will give it 5 stars and actually buy it. Its a shame Planet Terror wasn't released first. I fear this one will turn just about everybody on the fence about seeing away.Lastly, its almost sarcastic to include a second disc."
2,not nearly as good and funny as Planet Terror,"Death Proof went on and on with boring elements of Tarrontino's yapping. At least the end of the film was exciting, but that wasn't enough for me to give it more stars."
1,What movie are you people watching?,"This movie is boring!!!! Except for the last 10 minutes this movie is just people talking!!! And its not even interesting dialogue like Tarantino usually writes for his movies. I am a huge Quentin Tarantino fan. I even liked his story in Four Rooms, but this one is a total misfire. I was one of the lucky ones who got to experience the full Grindhouse movie in theaters and Tarantinos movie had people yawning and looking at there watches throughout. Very disappointing after Rodriguezs awesome Planet Terror and some hilarious faux trailers.I guess every movie maker has a misfire, and this is Tarantinos which I'm happy to say he corrected with his next film Inglorious Basterds!!!"
4,I WantThe Complete Grindhouse on DVD,"I really like Grindhouse,,, I mean, the 2 movies together with the fake trailers and commercials... but i really interest in the Death Proof dvd,.. only because I want to see the missing scene when Butterfly make a dance to Stuntman Mike... But I want a special edition of Grindhouse.. Planet Terror/Death Proof (just like the version of US cinemas), and the single version of the two movies im one package..... It Is really sad that american audience prefer stupid movies like Blaze of Glory... Tarantino and Rodriguez are amazing writers and directors,, and their movies always are fun..."
3,"Not Quentin's best, but not bad either!","Finally got around to seeing this; one of those flick ya keep meaning to and for one reason or another, wait a while. That being said, as I said, not Quentin's best, but it was hardly unwatchable or boring. Yes, it was way over the top most of the time, including the ending which, in another film, might be considered ludicrous. But somehow it fits here. For his role, Russell was surprisingly good, going pretty much against type. The snuff sequences, especially the first big one, were kind of a shock, but again, pure Tarentino. The plot did move a bit slowly at times, but was still sharp enough to keep you interested. The DVD extras were pretty cool, too. All told, worth seeing if you get Tarentino. If you don't, you may have a tougher time with it."
4,Very Different!,"I actually liked this wierd tale that is shot like a very cheap movie with intentional cuts and skips and grain in the film. Kurt Russell is a serial psycho that likes to murder women with his car. In the first portion of the film the director has a lot of interaction with a group of women that end up at a bar. Russell seems to have followed them to the bar. There they meet him and they know him only as Stuntman Man. He claims to have been a stuntman in many old tv shows and he drives a car that he claims could be used to ram a brick was at 100 mph without a problem. Russell eventually has his way with the women.The second half of the film involves a different group of women in a different town. When Russell tries to have his way with them he finds out fast that he messed with the wrong women!As with all Tarentino films there is a good deal of graphic gore that you come to expect. However, I found this movie entertaining."

1,Wait for it!!,What a rip off!!! I recommend waiting right before Christmas when (you know it's going to happen) they come out with the double feature on one disc. It's just the studio's way of milking every nickle they can out of this film!!!
4,Great Buy,I love this movie. It has the feel of a old classic and its funny but not too funny. I just like it.
5,"Muscle cars, cool music & a Psycho - LOVED IT!!","This is definitely added to my all-time favorites list. I loved it. Not just one, but Three awesome muscle cars. (The last horror movie to have a decent car in it was Phantasm, ffs!) The soundtrack is great. Kurt Russell as Stunt Man Mike - rocks. You get a likeable psycho, plenty of gore, a muscle car high speed crash that leaves out No details, a car chase & six females. There's even a backwoods hillbilly in the mix....."
3,An 80's stuntman's dream movie?,"A maniac stunt man is on the loose...He kills beautiful women by crashing into them.He meets female stunt womenwho bring him down.Gore, sexy girls and hot cars :it's like a formula for a teenage drive in movie?"
5,long time coming,"I ordered around 3/3/10 was giving a ship email around the next day, recived 3/28 someone could have walked it to my house from TN to MN faster then it got here, other than that happy with the movie."
4,That bad acting in the second half .,"If it wasn't for the bad acting in the second half of this film - Rosario Dawson excluded - i would've given it a five star .The film in short is about psycho stunt man stalker , who kills women using his stunt car . How ? watch the film .And since it's a tribute to the exploitation films of the past , you'll be treated with coloring problems , sound problems , glitches and that old films lines that shows up on the screen every now and then .Nice .What ruined the film for me is the bad acting from Tracie Thoms in the second half of the film . She was like a bad female version of Samuel L. Jackson . You can forgive Zoe Bell because she's a stunt woman and Mary Elizabeth Winstead for having a small role , unless Mr. Tarantino wanted them to act like that , But we can't know that . Commentary denied .The extras are not much . Come on Mr. Tarantino , give us a commentary man .Be generous like your brother in arms Robert Rodriguez , His dvd extras rock ."
1,The Lamest Guitarist Ever!,"This compilation could've been trimmed (mercifully)down to about 30 seconds if there was a rule against repeating the same tired licks. SRV may have been a nice guy, but he was one sorry excuse for a guitar player-more proof that all you have to do to satisfy the vast legion of dullards is turn it up. ""Passion"" doesn't replace his lack of technique, taste, originality, etc,ad nauseum."
4,Great Choice For The Casual Fan,"If you're a casual fan of SRV this, along with THE REAL DEAL: GREATEST HITS VOL.2, is a great place to start. While this is by no means a comprehensive collection, it does include selections from each of Vaughan's four original studio albums. From slow blues to shuffles to scorching blues-rock, it shows why he's considered a legend. The only real criticism I have is record companies' practice of including one previously unreleased track on ""greatest hits"" collections to try to lure hard-core fans into getting an album from which they have 90% of the material. (I hate it when that happens!)"
4,SRV Greatest,Has a lot of his best songs. It has a good mix of his early and later stuff. A great album if you like rockin' blues.
3,Its not the book bluray,"got the one in plastic case instead of the one I wanted, did not file a claim since Amazon is reviewing the item description and you get the same in the booklet (not as fancy tho)"
4,A Great Purse Book,"Absorbing book with strong female lead character.The book involved a lot of intrigue and there were at least a dozen suspects that could easily have been the bad guy. There was an intricate weaving of the story line and a romance between the crusader lawyer and the elusive billionaire. The mystery plot was believable and keeps the reader guessing and following clues along with Caroline and Jack.This book is a nice kind that you shove in your purse and yank out while waiting in lines. It provides several hours of entertainment and what more can you ask of a book?I'd rate it at PG 13, since there is one tame sex scene."
5,great!,"I love this frame. It is solid and sturdy and heavy. This is no light weight piece of junk. The assembly was only slightly confusing only because I have never built a futon before. Anyone who has ever built anything before, especially from wood, will not have any problem figuring it out. Yes, there were very minor things like a couple holes not lining up absolutely perfect or a couple holes drilled slightly to shallow...big deal...angle the screw slightly for a slightly off hole or 1 second with a drill to add a bit to a shallow hole. These things are nothing when working with wood and especially pre-made wood pieces from a factory. I would highly recommend this frame or company to anyone who asked!"
5,No nip needed,"These little fishies will give your felines hours of fun and there's no nip needed. I worry about toys stuffed with fillers since a friend lost her cat after eating one. These little guys are made out of rip stop nylon and they're so tough my cats can't rip them up. My Siamese boy will bring them to me in bed in the middle of the night--don't ask why. I often find fishy offerings on my pillow.Rebecca Kyle, April 2009"
1,Is this for real?!?!,"This is reminiscent of the sort of pseudo-historical trash produced during Nazi Germany about Jews. What's more odious here is that they got a couple of quislings to write it in order to add some legitimacy to their fundamentalist ranting. To quote a certain 19th Century German of Jewish extraction, ""religion is the opium of the masses"". Wake up people!!!!!"
2,Overall disappointing,"This book, along with the companion pieces on F4F and F6F aces by Barrett Tillman, appears in Osprey's ""Blue Devils"" compendium, where it is the weakest of the three sections. Particularly disappointing is the color artwork section, the ""eye candy"" that makes these Osprey titles so delighting (even to enthusiasts with more comprehensive works in their libraries). It seems that two different base profiles were used for the F4U, and neither is accurate. Note the canopies and cowl cooling flaps, compared to the pictures that appear in the book. Is it that hard to get an accurate F4U profile?"
1,Barely one star,See my review for the paperback version. I was severly disappointed with the lack of information. I have studied Joyce in Dublin and at NYC and wish an author would write a comprehensive work on this incredible and talented writer.
4,Good product for the price,"I was disappointed with my first Manfrotto tripod because it didn't work with the Manfrotto head I was using, which I found very odd. Ended up having to buy a new one and just take the hit on the first one. In and of itself, it is sturdy. It isn't very heavy, so you need to weigh it down on some shots."
5,Super car interior duster,"This duster is compact, handy and very effective. I leave it in the car for use all of the time. Highly recommend this product."
1,Beware,Started to fall apart within 1 month of occasional use. Tufts of the red yarn just started to fall out. Unimpressed and will certainly no be repeating that mistake.
5,Compact car duster,"I own the bigger version of this duster for the outside of the car. With a black dash, every speck of dust seems to glare at you. I keep this under the seat in a bag. You can just whip it out and run it across the car instrument panel, etc. and it grabs all the dust particles in seconds."
4,Very good,"Good It works it's like magic very, very good . I will continue buying this product because It's like magical"
4,Now I Finally Understand,"To progress from the level of advanced beginner to intermediate level (and onwards...) you must understand Japanese verbs. Most courses try to hide the complexity of Japanese verbs, but in a few well laid out pages this book shows how logical and easy to understand the overall structure of verbs and their many forms really are. Buy it as an additional reference to help with a course, don't try to understand everything but instead use it as a map to understand what you are learning. Later you will find yourself using it more and more. I am an full timne student in Japan and I carry it to class everyday. Shame it is in the evil romaji."
2,Two words: Wedding Music,"The phrase that comes to mind in rating this cd is ""Wedding Music"". I bought the cd for track7 'Turn the beat around'--and it's a great track, but the rest of the songs are all just old covers. I love Gloria's voice and her energy, and thought I was getting ""Dance remixed"" versions of her stuff. Sadly, I was mistaken."
2,What Was Ms. Estefan Thinking?,"I got this CD as a freebie from Columbia House many years ago. I listened to it , was very disappointed, and I threw it away. Her remakes of Vickie Sue Robinson's ""Turn The Beat Around"" and ""Everlasting Love"" along with other slow ballads were among some of the CHEESIEST remakes I've ever heard. Hey, the cheesier, the better, I guess. That is why I'm not a big fan of remakes now these days. I prefer the original."
1,Strictly by-the-numbers covers album,"Ms. Estefan sings a collection of oldies here, and NONE of them have anything unique to offer in the way of clever arrangements or an individual point of view. ""Cherchez La Femme"", the great song originally recorded by Dr. Buzzard's Original Savannah Band, is virtually identical, minus the pizzaz and sass. It is transformed into a bland vehicle for Estefan. Ditto ""Turn The Beat Around"". What is the point of copying the original musical and vocal arrangements so closely that it renders the remake utterly pointless? Why listen to these cheezy remakes when the originals are the real deal? Keep these questions in mind, and before you invest in this hollow exercise, seek out the originals, and leave this empty collection alone."
5,Fantastic!,"Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me is an excellent collection of classic hit songs. Gloria's voice is perfect on this album! My favorite song: It's Too Late. And God, she looked great in the music video for that song!"
5,The sexy side of the Steal Mill...,"If like me you are a fan of ""Twin Peaks"" and films of David Lynch, then I'm sure you have noticed a recurring theme in some of his work, that of ""the mill"". This album is like an ode to the rhythmic, industrial sounds one would find in a place like the Packard Saw Mill, or if you were out with Frank one night and drove past the mill in Lumberton, layered over with good old fashioned Americana sex appeal wrapped inside of one of Lynch's dream sequences...If you have seen Mulholland Dr. then you have heard some of this music before (mostly towards the end). Also if you have seen Fire Walk With Me then you have heard this type of sound (the scenes in Canada with Jeac).Over all a very fun trip into Lynch's world, and a great album to have sex to!"
3,"a strong effort, but not as good as the albums it's between","This album marks a transition from the heavier sound of blind to a more groove-based southern-style sound that also characterizes wiseblood and America's Volume Dealer. There are some great songs on this album, most notably ""Clean My Wounds"", with its impossibly infection guitar beat, and the swirling and heartfelt ""Seven Days"". On the whole, though, the album is rather spotty. The two instrumentals are pretty lifeless, and Peepper Keenan's vocals are shaky in many places. This is a solid effort, but unless you're a diehard you're better off picking up the more polished Wiseblood or the heavier Blind."
5,Great!!!,"This cd has the Weather Girls best hits and one of my all time favorites, Hope, which you hardly ever find!!! I remember having this on vinyl many years ago!!!"
2,Scratch Crackt,The jewel case was broken in shipping. The cd itself has a problem with the first song...it plays so far then starts skipping...am not able to clesan it in an attempt to remedy the situation there. Sorry
3,"Okay, but not great.","Unlike a lot of other reviews, our spots almost completely disappear when exposed to any type of warmth, even little hands. (I thought that was so cool!)I saw these at Bed, Bath, & Beyond for $10 just before Christmas and ended up going back a few days later and getting them. My son loves dogs and he loves baths, so I thought they'd be great. My son seems to really like them but he never plays with them in the tub. He chews on the legs and the head. He throws them. He lines them up along the table and then flings them all off.So while they aren't played with as intended, he still likes them. They have held up really well and seem pretty durable for a toy (I actually drove over one of them and it popped back to normal like nothing ever happened.)"
1,Doesn't work AT ALL!,"The stains on the puppies fade a little bit when scrubbed with the washcloth but they don't disappear completely and the doggies remain ""dirty"". My 3-year old son was frustrated and disappointed. Waste of my money!"
5,Windows to the soul,"A favorite album since my senior year in college (1963-64). Perfect background for late night bull sessions, as well as just introspective listening. John Lewis went beyond MJQ to create a tapestry woven of full orchestration and flute and baritone sax solos (and of course, his own piano artistry on one solo). I only listen to this album late at night or on overcast afternoons -- enhancing the mellowness of low light and quiet times."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"did this movie make any sense to anyone? it's the definitive example of the romantic comedy cliche being executed without any regard for detail. just have an attractive man and woman engage in a few antagonistic interactions, then end it with ""they're in love"". most Adam Sandler movies have more character logic in their ""romances"". a few scenes had some entertainment value so i'll give it 2 stars instead of 1 but the main plot is one of the biggest messes hollywood has ever produced."
5,Fall In Love With This Film - I Did,"What can I say? Perfect cast, setting, music, beautiful story - this film has absolutely everything I could possibly want. Robert Downey Jr is so believeable, you could cry. When he's hurt, you feel it. When he turns on those steps, to try to reach her just one more time - who hasn't done the same? Quiet, sensitive touches by him are what is so memorable and outstanding.Marisa Tomei also deserves applause. Her character is likeable, sweet, but not 'sacchariny'. Everyone pulls together to make a precious jewel of a film - the one I'll always put on at the end of a long, cold day to make me feel HUMAN again.All time favourite."
5,This movie makes you wonder what your destiny is,"I enjoy this movie because it is humorous and romantic. Robert Downey Jr. and Marisa Tomei make a great pair. My favorite line from the movie is ""I know he would kill tigers for you."" You will love this movie if you have enjoyed other Marisa Tomei movies and if you like Robert Downey Jr. If you believe in soul mates or destiny be sure to watch this movie."
2,Miscast?,"The plot was OK and Tomei charming and delightful, but to say I was not taken by the appearance and performance of Downey falls within the department of understatement.My antipathy grew to where I ceased watching with the movie about 75% completed.Some one of these days, I may watch the remainder to see Tomei. GVP"
5,Someone was Watching,I think that the book was great! cause since i never read it makes me want to read more books.The story of Chris and Pat trying to find Molly after being kidnapped keeps you holding on for more and more. At the end of the book you kind of knew what was going to happen. Beside the point i think that it is a great book and it good for all aged readers.
5,Refreshing and Provocative Parables and Stories.,"Anthony de Mello was a religious master of the twentieth century teaching profound spiritual truths through stories and discourses. This book, one of his early works was first published in 1982 in India. The present volume is a reprint edition that targets the American reader. It contains 124 stories, both ancient and modern, from a variety of cultures, countries and religions. The author takes credit only for stringing them together and appending a comment to most of the stories. These comments are often insightful and provocative. The book as a whole is an enjoyable reading, illustrative of profound realities."
4,Analyze yourself to become more intelligent emotionally,"This is a great book to help all of us to analyze ourselves better , to be able to understand our un-real ILLUSIONS and our distorted view o f others, these stories are sometimes difficult to grasp , but as soon as you think and understand them and apply them ; then your life will begin to change or be modified, remember always to have a FLEXIBLE mind and to be very sincere with yourself when you read the books o f this excellent , honest, sincere and great Psychologist A. de Mello ,his books are also publised in Spanish.Thanks to the publishers: ING. EMILIO CRISTANCHO GUEVARA; e-mail: edfasa@hotmail.com"
3,Not for the mathematically challenged,"I used this book for Cal I-III and if you are quick at picking up concepts then go for it. I found some applied math books helpful in understanding difficult concepts. As the book progresses, the material is better for someone who already knows calculus. A lot of important concepts are explained bluntly with problems that are more advanced than the explanations. The epsilon delta section took me a while to grasp compared to other beginning topics, so if you have this book don't get discouraged. I didn't even see epsilon delta proofs until an advanced class that is devoted to that particular subject. Use as a reference, particularly the chapters that would normally constitute Cal II."
2,Not suitable for an introduction to calculus,"This book is more designed for students who already know calculus and need a reminder. It is not suitable for students who are learning calculus for the first time, and it is particularly unsuitable for teaching with the ""Socratic Method."""
2,It's like presbyopic glasses,"When I wear them in water, everything goes blur and I feel very dizzy. They are just like presbyopic glasses."
3,Mythological parallel to some Biblical stories,"This book is an important text as far as the parallels to the Bible concerning the great flood, the use of similar imagery ,and symbolism. However, don't expect this book to prove or disprove any Biblical text. The majority of this text is mythological in nature and hosts a managerie of gods. If one digs enough they may be able to relate some of the figures in this book to Biblical antediluvian characters. This book is as good as one can expect as far as a translation to the English language. A religous scholar will want to read this book and probably be required to read it for degree requirements."
3,Very readable,"I am always suspicious of books with introductory material nearly as long as the text (61 pages vs. 96 pages). Unfortunately, this book confirms my prejudice. The front material provides an easy and useful summary of the material, history of the translation, the 19th century shock at the flood myth etc. The material is superficial - appropriate for late high school students looking for the ""good stuff"" without any interest in the depth of the story. The translation itself is very readable - almost too much so as the missing portions of the text are nearly invisible. The illustrations are very appropriate to the text as translated. I would recommend this volume for use as a very early introduction to epic literature or as a light summer read."
5,thought provoking,This is a nice tale that reminds one of those who come before and those who will follow. Atwell has a way of looking at the world through a multi dimensional lens.
4,Sappy Happy,"I just liked this movie despite its predictability. When it came back on cable recently I remembered how good the music was, so had to order the CD. Good quality, quick delivery, good music - many timeless standards and some good instrumentals, and even Shawn Colvin."
3,"Passable for its time, but showing its age","I saw this in the theater as a kid, and remembered it as being pretty good ... even a bit scary in places. Upon seeing it again, however, I was a bit disappointed. The storyline is pretty trite and the special effects are rudimentary. Still, it's a cut above the average for a late-1950s sci-fi movie, and Lansing does a pretty decent job in the lead role ... even if he appears to have an immense head in one scene. (Weird camera angle?)"
4,Very good and entertaining,Robert Lansing and the rest of the cast did an excellent job. I found the movie to be very good and I enjoyed it.
3,Wayward Son,"Although John DOYLE again creates a beautiful CD of acoustic Celtic flavored music, it is somewhat anticlimactic when compared to his first CD ""Evening Comes Early"". This is not to say he is a ""one hit wonder"" type of musician. Doyle appears to be careful in whom he chooses as collaborators for the instrumentation and backup singers on his works. He does so here. Anyone who enjoys soulful Celtic music will like this CD.It is just brutally difficult for any musician(s) to top their previous stellar work! Do yourself a favor and purchase BOTH CD's .... then you will understand why ""Wayward Son"" is good; but you will be forced to acknowledge that ""Evening Comes Early"" is a gem of a masterpiece that came out ""Early"" in Doyle's solo career. He is a genius in tempo, timing and taste."
4,Does the job well,"Not bad. The anchors were completely useless, though, I found. I ended up buying better, heavy-duty ones. All in all, though, it does the job."
5,These are Great.,"I bought 2 of these. When anyone looks in my room, they see a Trek 7000 Woman's bike (my best friend's), and my Trek 7000 hanging together. I tried using the anchors (which were totally worthless - maybe a graphite bike will work), but found that if you want it to work properly, you really need to find a couple of studs behind the wall. It will then properly support any aluminum frame bikes (and maybe even some balanced steel touring bikes)."
3,watch how chubby the bike,I was pleased with the sturdiness and overall construction of hanger but problem came with type of bike I have. My bike is a hybrid. A cross between a street and mountain bike. Even though it has an aluminum frame. It still has some wt. I could not hang the bike off the floor as instructed which is fine since I was only looking for space in my room. I live in an apt. with plaster walls (another problem). Get good wall anchors (don't use what is included) and be careful how thick the plaster when hanging on outside wall (before you go through plaster to brick wall). I also found getting my tire into hanger difficult once vertical. So if you have a bike like the picture (i.e. a light racing bike) great. But if a serious one. Be warned. May not work as advertised.
1,Don't waste your money,"I am sure this might be useful for some people, but not sure who. It says that this is the right size for all bikes, but the wheels on my mountain bike (standard one, not anything special) were too fat for it. :-("
3,Hmmm,"I'll admit, they have good voices individually. However, they sound like they're trying to over-power each other as an ensemble. Personally, I'd listen to Amici Forever over them. Plus, Amici's version of Unchained Melody is sooooo much better."
5,Inspirational,"After Amici-the Opera Band, I thought that there couldn't be more beautiful music on the planet....well, there is equally beautiful music found within Il Divo. And I'd have to say that the talent, beauty and inspirational vocals are absolutely breathtaking. Thank you for making beautiful music for this world!"
1,ILL Divo,"I listened to this disc on the recommendation of a friend, but ended up wishing I hadn't. It's overblown. It's overwrought. They oversing. And I couldn't wait for it to be over.Sure they seem to have pretty good individual voices, but they are supposed to be a group, and they have no concept of blend. They sound as if they are all trying to bellow louder than the others.This is simply a manufactured 'popera' boy-band. If you like that kind of cheesy pablum, great. Otherwise, save your money."
2,"Good Talent, But No Harmony and Overpowering","I first saw these guys when Simon Cowell introduced them on the Oprah program. I thought they had potential, my wife didn't like them at all. I only figured that their voices might come across better in a recording studio and thought I would give the album a fair shot.I regret that now.It seems that the best parts of this album is when only one of these guys are singing. Simon said he found these opera singers individually and figured they would sing together wonderfully. That explains why they are all from different countries. And, yes, they each sing fantastically well... alone. But when they all sing together, they seem a little bit off and don't harmonize well.And, unfortunately, when they sing they drown out the music. They are simply too loud and overpowering. In the end I could only listen to about half this album and then I couldn't take it anymore."
4,perfectionists but...,These are perfectionist singers but sometimes the operatic voice comes through too harsh.
5,The best CD ever recorded,"To those who only gave this CD one or two stars, I say ""jealous"" is the word. They wish that they could have a portion of their talent or looks. They men in Il Divo are extraordinary. Their music gives me incredible joy. Well done, Simon!"
3,Not so impressed,Of course they are good. But they're not GREAT. My husband bought me this cd. I'm glad he wasted the money and not me! The Opera Band is much better.
1,Since when does Michael Bolton speak Spanish?,"These guys sound like Michael Bolton on valium. And in Spanish.If you totally dug Celine Dion's ""Divas Las Vegas"" special, then you'll love Il Divo. If you've always thought that Fabio should quit doing commercials and launch a music career, then you'll love Il Divo. If you truly believe that Clay Aiken is God's gift to women, then you'll love Il Divo. Otherwise, you'll think it's a piece of crap.Simon Cowell needs to do the world a favor and go jump off a bridge."
2,Another Pop Opera Group Jumps on the 'Band Wagon',"For the record - I love opera and I'm glad that opera is now entering the mainstream through pop opera bands. It has opened up a whole new audience and generation to classical music via beautiful, sexy young singers (gone is the fat lady with horns sterotype) and upbeat tempos and arrangements. But, because of Amici, Watson to name two success stories- you got random acts of opera being recorded and packaged. These handsome young puppies sound great, but I've heard it all before - the songs and the voices. Nothing break out interesting or new. Now maybe if they put flower pots on thier heads...."
5,Il Divo,I like the music of Il Divo.I think that they sing together very well.I purchased their cd and enjoy it very much.Hope they have another one out in the near future.
4,eL DIVO,THE DVD SIDE PLAYS GREAT IN THE DVD AT HOME AND THE AUDIO SIDE PLAYS GREAT AT HOME AND NOT IN MY CAR.
4,Oh my friggen god!!!!!!,"I have to say I really don't care if the groups formed via auditions, their voices are amzing. I am a classical singer and I can hear their training. Can I just call them the four sexy tenors (and yes one is more of a baritone with a good range)?"
4,"Finally, Guys Who Can Sing","I enjoy pop music. But listening to the radio these days, I rarely find anything new where the artist can actually sing well. Sure, Christina Aguilera and Mariah Carey have powerful voices, but enough of the vocal acrobats.On Il Divo's debut CD, you'll find beautfuls songs where the guys can hold a note! ""Unbreak My Heart"" and ""Mama"" are two notable songs. Listening to the CD on my iPod during my commute home certainly relaxes me after a stressful day!"
5,Congratulations ! Simon Cowell & Il Divo,"Absolutely Beautiful ....Two years of searching for the perfect Male Voices has paid off BIG TIME for Simon Cowell ..Every song is wonderful...From The remake of the classic Toni Braxton "" Unbreak My Heart"" to ""Mama""... THANK YOU SIMON ! This CD has a permenent place on my cd system !! BRAVO !!!"
1,Has to be the worst sound I've ever heard....,"What is with all the hype for these guys???? I don't get it?? It's gotta be the money for the record execs, as someone else pointed out, they are riding the marketing wave to the bank, and laughing all the way! This album should be put out of its misery. The guys do NOT harmonize well together, they sound like a bunch of dying dogs. They have ruined the value of some wonderful music with the horrible renditions. Just listen to the samples first before you fall into the brainwash of the record executives."
3,"""Lite"" opera for the American Idol fan","Three True Facts about Il Divo:(1) They were hand-picked by Simon Cowell(2) My 74-year-old mom thinks they're the bee's knees(3) My mom also loves American Idol AND Simon Cowell'Nuff said. If this isn't enough information for you, then you probably won't want to pick this CD up."
5,Magical Music,This CD is very relaxing. I can drive and not be stressed about the traffic during rush hour. The voices of the singers are truly magical.
5,No More Misconceptions,"Have you ever wondered why your motorcycle's handling changed from the way you intended? This book will clear up all your misconceptions and guide you towards your desired specific task. This is a book for graduate school designers, but presents information that is easily understood. This is brain food for the technicallly inclined."
1,I don`t like it!!!,"I think the story is not very interesting. And it`s very difficult to understand, because there are a lot of time leaps between the past and the future and you can`t differentiate between them. I wouldn`t recommend it."
5,Lost Album,"This is a fantastic album! I have been searching for years to find and replace my lost album. I was sixteen years old when I first heard and felled in love with the song Lover Letters. The expression, message of love and commitment was reassuring. Now, it is still something of comfort to hear in a song. I find the music tranquil, engaging, sweet and meaningful. It will always be apart of my collection of the greatest music ever! Thanks Mr. Coke Escovedo"
3,"Not the Best, Not the Worst","This kit was hard to use but using a brush, a painting brush,makes it easier to apply. The crayons are really hard to get the color on. I melted it and it worked a little better."
4,Does its job,"The system does the job we bought it for. The missed call part is kind of annoying, if you answer a call with one handset or another phone at home, the other handset will list it as ""missed"". After a while, it becomes useless since you won't remember if it was a real ""missed call"", or you actually talked with the caller with another phone. The other thing is once I turn on the speaker phone, I can't figure out how to turn it off without hanging up. Maybe it's time to check the manual. Overall it's a nice phone. No regret."
2,Low volume and bad answering machine,"I have one of those since a year ago. First time I noticed is that the volume is so low. After a lot of 'can you speak louder???' what I have to do is to use the speakerphone all the time. Another issue I have with this phone is the answering machine. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. After not getting messages for a week, I have to unplug and plug it in again and it works.. at least for a couple of weeks. Still, I was thinking It wasn't so bad, but then, about 4 weeks ago, one of the handsets is not working any more, so I have to get a new phone and this time, it;s not going to be Panasonic."
3,Voice quality and volume poor,"It functions well except that it's voice quality and volume is very poor. Even after you set EV Enhanced Voice feature, it is not quite audible. The key pad is an improvement from their earlier models. Range is better and charged battery works longer when off the cradle and when phone is being used.Price is good for a dual antena, one for receiving and the other for transmission, cordless phone. VK"
4,A good quality cordless phone.,"The Panasonic KX-TG5632M is good. It is quite easy to use. Manual is clear. Basically, it provides all I need - clear voice qaulity, handfree speaker, mute and etc. The only complaint is when one handset picks up the call, the other handset shows a misleading message ""Missing call"" on the panel."
3,"Panasonic KX is good, but it could be better","This phone's reception is great. It works as advertised very well. I knew there was no speed dial feature and typing the first letters of whomever you wish to call works almost as well. However, I do not like that the answering machine has no audible signal. It is easy to miss new messages. It also does not indicate if you have voice mail (Uniden does). I wish the dial would light up too. It is hard to see at night."
2,Mid-life phone now malfunctioning,"Great for first few years and now completely malfunctioning - need to replace!We bought this phone several years ago and it worked fine up till a couple weeks ago... the phone is easy to use and had good voice quality. Recently, the phone started acting extremely peculiar and I now have ordered a replacement phone. The phone randomly drops/hangs up on calls, reception has gotten irregular on the recipient side (getting complaints) and sometimes won't allow you to dial out giving a message something about being too far from the base (and I am about two feet)...I use the phone for business purposes and it's extremely embarassing when you drop off of calls and have to constantly apologize for losing calls and dialing back in. The point of a land line is to avoid all that stuff that happens with cell phones!"
2,Nice but...,Nice phone but don't drop it. The antena broke right away. Good range though but doesn't stay charged.
3,Call ID is not big enough,I bought this phone because it was cheaper than going out and buying two new batteries. I am happy with the fact that it came with two handsets plus a base unit and a separate cradle for the extension phone.My problem is that my other panasonic had a larger Caller ID screen and also showed the phone number and name of the personcalling. This one will not show the unless you put their name in your phone book.
3,Voice Enhancer?,"I bought this phone as a gift for a friend who seems to have trouble hearing people on the phone. Its much better than the old phone because I haven't heard ""what?"" since.I have tried the phone and to me the ""Voice Enhancer"" feature seemed to only make everything louder."
4,Wall adapter ugly,"The phone works great. I bought it replace an older Panasonic that gave me good service. But the wall adapter is riduculous. The bracket makes the phone look cantilevered into the air. The old adapter was much better. No one at Panasonic cared to design a wall bracket/phone for wall mounting.The real problem is that the old phone had a ""snap in"" feature so the phone could be vertical in the cradle. In this model the phone will just fall out. So they stick the unit out of the wall in the same orientation as is it were on a desk.If you care about aesthetics, give this a second thought before buying.I may build a custom cherry surround so it looks better...but Panasonic deserves to get dinged for poor design choices on this one."
5,GREAT PHONE!,Phone works great. Quality product and not some cheap Vtech like phone.Keeps charge for a long time. Has great features and was at a great price.
2,Cannot be heard well from this phone,"I bought this phone 2 weeks ago, and found it very handy but with some drawbacks, which is the reason why I gave 2 stars.1. One of them is poor volume quality. (VE) feature is absolutely useless and doesn't make any sense, I would rather buy one without this feature and maybe save some money.2. After a while, I noticed that too often caller asks me to speak loud, which is annoying. I was trying to solve this problem with Panasonic customer support, but nothing works, even another feature like 'booster' for handset during the outbound calls. And this is not the problem with my phone service or phone line, since my old, \cordfull' phone works find.3.Having a feature to synch phonebook between different handsets, it doesn't allow you to assign 'fast dial' buttons, so you always have to browse your phonebook before you can make a call."
2,Inconsistent Audibility,"I frequently have to go a hardwired phone in order to be heard by the other party. The Panasonic phone signal fades in and out, most often blocking out my voice from the recipient but sometimes making it impossible for me to hear them.I called Panasonic about the problem. The only meaningful suggestion they had was to send the phone in for exchange or repair.Other than the audibility issue, other features appear to be satisfactory."
2,Can't understand the hype,"This movie is SO boring. Its badly acted, except for Vin (and his performance is why I gave it 2 stars), and for a movie that could've potentially been a really great ride, it just a big let down. It doesn't have any edge whatsoever. If you want an action rush, get Speed or Die Hard. The people who gave this 5 Stars must just enjoy the pretty colors on the cars, because there is nothing else redeeming about this movie. I don't know how they managed to make street racing a boring event....but they did."
4,Cars are the real stars,"I knew I would love this movie. It wasn't going to make me think and some movies are made to serve that purpose. The feeble plot revolves around carefree street racers who use their lifestyle as a facade for their bad-boy activites, which include hi-jacking trucks at 60 mph whilst clad in too-cool-for school black garb. If you think I gave away any of the plot, you're wrong. Even I didn't figure it out until it was blatantly obvious. Perhaps it had been obvious all along, if I hadn't checked my brain at the theater door. But as I said, I enjoyed it. Paul Walker's character of Brian might have been wooden and a total bore but Jordana Brewster was certainly nice to look at. A popcorn flick in top gear. Only speed-freaks need apply."
3,A movie of hilariously BAD dialogue.,"And bad plot, and bad acting on both the main character's part. I really enjoyed the movie because of the stupid college-boy dialogue which really helped show that car movies aren't entertaining past car scenes. The car scenes were great, of course we all love seeing suped-up rice rockets and Supras, all being driven by macho testosterone-pumped pigs.Vin Diesel plays a bonehead who knows how to drive stick like a man, and Paul Walker plays a pansy who can't. Really I don't see how Paul Walker was supposed to be a break-out hit, given the casting of Walker and the weak dialogue...It is a rather important movie if you are a fan of action/driving films and want to be informed of the lowering quality of movies of that genre."
4,YOU SHOULD WATCH THIS!,"Good movie, good plot.Especially the truck hijacking scenes were superb.And there are Paul Walker and Vin Diesel with some 900 hp speed machines in it.If you're a car fan you'll love it,if you're not you'^re still gonna like it."
4,Good Movie,"I have seen the fast and the furious multiple times. It is a good movie. I am here to just say that the cars are sweet, but american muscle would smoke them. The 650 hp supra would get toasted by 1300 hp mustangs. Like the saying go'sThere is no replacement for displacement."
1,Car chase movie for 10 year boys,"A movie clearly made by people who have never driven in a real race, this movie was made so 10 year old boys could watch it and go ""cool!"" before they go back to sitting in front of the TV and getting fat. I have met a few adults who liked it but mostly they belong to the can't-get-a-date-live-with-mommy-when-they-are-40 crowd.Sadly Vin Disiel is a good actor, just one who would rather make money than movies."
4,FAST IS A UNDER STATEMENT !,"FAST CARS, MODEL/ACTORS, AND HOT LOOKING IMPORTS SET THE SEEN FOR A NONE STOP ACTION MOVIE THAT CAN ONLY INSPIRE MORE STREET RACING.EVER BEEN TO AN IPORT CAR SHOW IN SO.CA.? ALL THE MAJOR MANUFACTURES OF RACING ITEMS AND THE WHOS-WHOS OF RACING CAN BE FOUND THROUGH OUT THE ENTIRE MOVIE. THE CLIMAX COMES WITH THE ULTIMATE RACE SCENE PITTING OLDSCHOOL HOT ROD- V- A SUPERCHARGED ECLIPSE. WITHOUT GIVING AWAY TOO MUCH I CAN SAY GONE IN SIXTY SECOND COMES IN A DISTANT SECOND. NOW RACE OUT THERE AND GO GET IT!"
3,O.K. But Nothing Special...,This movie was good but not great. There was quite a bit of action but there just wasn't anything real special. The acting was pretty good but it's just not a movie that's going to stick with you. I guess I'm going to have to watch the sequel right away before I forget what the original was about. If you want to just sit back & watch some nice street racing then I recommend this movie but if you are looking to really get something out of a movie I'd say pass.
3,The Fast and the Furious,"To all you who love car movies, this one kicks some major you know what. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker give great performances. Also the chick is hot, cars are PHAT, and the movie is non-stop action. If you love movies like Gone in 60 seconds and Driven, you will love this. It is a must own movie. To all the H-town All-Stars this is for you. I'M OUT!!!!!!!"
4,A Cult Classic!,"Great film from my youth I was like 11 when this film came out. Brings back old memories of simplier days. This film is cult classic that is a must watch, just like FIght Club. A rocking soundtrack, fun scenes, cool actors, etc. Great film, watch it and enjoy!"
2,UhHh...,"This movie is [not good], Highly over-rated. Let me tell you why I say this:1- THE ACTING IS [not good]2- The creativity and film work is at its best an amature level3- The story is [not good]The only good part about this movie is it has some nice cars to look at. So my advice is just go find yourself a website with some nice cars and there you go, no need to put yourself through this [movie]."
1,Horrible,"This Movie Represent everything wrong with modern day america. It caters to the MTV teenybopper generation who love everything that has commercial appeal. Everyone is fawning over Vin Diesel. Quick note kiddies : This guy makes Pauly Shore look like an Oscar calibre actor. And the plot, u ask? Well there really is none. Hoochies dance around like Rona Berret on speed anidiots risk their lives for the pursuit of racing in their ""sooped up"" Rice Rockets. So if u love britney, ,MTV, and all that caters to our misguided youth, You will probably love this crap."
3,I Can't Even Remeber Why I Bought This,"This is a half decent movie but not one I'd like to watch again. If you're a fan of Paul Walker, Vin Diesel, cool cars, or hot chicks then this one's for you, otherwise, don't bother."
3,"Ok, but not great","The movie did not require much thought to watch. Not a lot of character developement nor a lot of good conversation. There where, however, lots of mindless racing and a few crashes. Some reviewers have compared this movie to ""Point Break"". The storylines are very similar but the quality of actors and the general feel of the movie is nowhere near ""Point Break"". If you are looking for a couple of hours of tricked-out street racing, see this movie. If you are looking for something a little deeper, look elsewhere."
5,vroom vroom,Wow....this is on my top 3 list of movies ever...and that is can compete with saving private ryan and black hawk down is just plain awsome...why don't more people make movies like this!
5,"Matt Klunk's opinion of ""The Fast and the Furious""","I am a car fanatic to start with, and have dreamed of owning a Toyota Supra Twin Turbo since I learned to drive in 1998. It is still only a dream, but when I heard that this movie's feature car was a Supra I couldn't wait to see it. I first saw the movie at the drive-in this past summer, it was awesome there, and I decided to buy it on DVD as soon as it came out. I did just that, and you should too; as this movie might just be one of the coolest, fastest, and most addictive movies ever made."
2,Where's the characters?,"Oh wait, characters do not matter in an action packed film like this one. Its all about the cars, women, the special effects, and the speed! Hmmmm, seems more like the definitive film for a Kid Rock fan, then the good Art-house flick. Well, if you like action, get this film. Otherwise, if your like me, come on over and watch Emma."
1,The Gay and Gritty Would Be a Better Name,"I took my nephew to see this movie. What a piece of garbage. I thought it was bad seeing all these little twits driving around the cities in their rug burners, but now they make a movie about them.Unless your under 18, don't rent, buy or borrow this movie."
5,The Fast and the Furious,"This movie has great camera work...The storyline is interesting too. It has some of the besat cars and it just makes we wanna drive!!! If you're gonna see a move...this is the movie to see! Overall, its an ""action packed thril ride in your seat"" type of movie."
1,Don't be fooled,"This movie is awful. Vin Diesel is an awful actor, the screenplay is absolutley trash, the director obviously has no idea how to make a good movie. Vin Diesel always plays the tough guy and it was good for a change to see a different kind of role in Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan. Everything is too fake. TOO fake. Don't be fooled by the awesome action, all right, it's too fake. Beleive me, my father was a race car driver, he's seen this movie, it's all bull. He noticed a fault every time they got into a car. This is a pathetic try at a tough racing movie. Trust me, it's not worth it."
3,If you like fast cars....GO SEE IT,"Just saw an advance screening of The Fast and the Furious. Vin Diesel could fast become our new action hero. Who could be cooler than this guy? His voice alone is a shock wave. The movie is somewhat predictable, but the racing and stunts make the movie worth it. Some of the car scenes gave my buddy motion sickness(we were 4th row center), no kidding, so you know you are in for a joy ride. Stay till after the credits, when you get sort of an epilogue; and you know the Dom will return. I can't wait."
5,"Becky's review of ""The Fast and the Furious","I loved this movie! It was one of my favorites. I loved all the characters, the two lead male characters were amazing! I also liked the two lead female characters a lot! This will continue to be one of my favorite movies of all time."
2,English DTS is in French!,"Cool cars, beautiful people but no storyline to speak of, no character development & if you choose English DTS, all you get is Dolby Surround-Sound!"
1,Fell below my low expectations,"I was hoping for a mindless car movie. It's certainly mindless, but it's not even about cars. There's more fighting and shooting than racing. (And it's not a very good fighting and shooting movie.) What driving is shown is less realistic than a Bond film. It looks like they did the Benny Hill trick of speeding up the film. Then after a minute of driving, they get out and talk about cars -- and the dialog must have been written by someone who has never owned a car or read a single word about racing. If you like cars, you'll hate this movie, and if you're not into cars, the ads have probably already convinced you not to buy it.If you want a car movie, I recommend Bullitt. Thirty years later, it's still king."
1,Boycott this movie it has killed too many,This one is not recommended it is however good but there are to many kids that like this stuff and are stupidly reperforming these stunts the movie just for this should have been rated X and only seen by the mature.It has killed to many and done so much bad.In November of 2003 a kid named Greg Farmhouse saw this movie 10 times and he was with his friend Ryan Lefine and with my friend Shawn MacMelely in the car the 2 in the front died on impact in the car accident with no alcohol to play.And Shawn who was where-ing his seat belt was injured but back to normal quickly so far these kids and any other kids that youpersonally no that were killed in Car crashes boycott this
4,"gavins report on ""the fast and the furious""","I think this is a very good and interesting. The movie is mostly about this guy named Dominick Toretto (Vin Diesel). Dominick and his friends high-jack a few trucks with dvd players, t.v. and stuff like that. So the cops send Brian Spilner (Paul Walker) to join Dominick's racing gang to find out whos high-jacking the trucks. So David and Dominick become close friends.And in the end Brian and Dominick drag race eachother, and Dominick gets in a car accident and the cops had already found out that Dominick was the one who was high-jacking the trucks, and when the cops were on their way Brian let Dominick go.I would reccommend this picture to people who like cars,racing,and action."
3,Point N.O.S.,"Yes, it's fast. Yes, it's furious. Original, it 'ain't. Substitute Patrick Swayze for Vin Diesel, Keanu Reeves for Paul Walker, and surfboards for tricked-out Honda Civics and you've got Point Break with outlaw street racers. The overall picture is still good. The sound is awesome. Just don't expect any depth or sophistication story-wise. Oh, and the ending does differ from Point Break just slightly. This movie has kewl cars, hot chics, snappy dialogue, boneheaded cops, and even the Japanese are the bad guys in this summer flick. If the sound of engines revving bothers you, don't bother buying a ticket. Lots of chrome, NOS, burned rubber, and sub-compact fun."
3,Good movie....poor portrayal of the true dragsters,"Don't get me wrong. I liked this movie. The races were fun to watch, and the storyline was interesting enough. However, I felt that it did not truly represent the true street racers or dragsters....that and it's more like a 2 hour NOS commercial.Why the heck would you race an RX-7 with a system that must have weighed like a ton in the truck? Or race any car that carries a 200 pound wing on the back? Oh no...one of the guys had a Motech exhaust on order....hehehehe....Bottom line, you will like it if you can overcome thinking how over the top this movie is."
5,GREAT MOVIE! BEST YET!,This movie is very enjoyable even for drama lovers because it has drama in it as well as thrilling action. My mother which does not at all like action movies really enjoyed this one and even wants to buy it as soon as it comes out on DVD. The surround effects are great and I gotta tell you that the guys are HOOOT too. This movie is what a movie should look like and be like. One word----> INCREDIBLE.
3,Decent,"Fear not, fellow hip hop heads, the Game shall be on welfare (like most rappers) in a few years after he has spent all of his money on women, cars, and booze!"
5,Don't F__k wit Aftermath/Shady/G-Unit,"This cd is ill, its been along time coming but gangster real gangster rap is back. The Game is from the town of the GodFather of Gangster Rap the late Eazy-E. With the likes of 50 cent,Lloyd Banks, Young Buck, Tony Yayo and The Game. G-Unit is the true Gangster Unit. Watch as Shady/G-Unit/Aftermath Blast but I expect The Game to be the true exlopsion"
5,stop hating the hotest rapper,I just finished litening to THE DOCUMENTARY.This album is the best rap album since 50 cent's debut.It is even comparable to the Get Rich or Die Trying and is far better than Banks' and Buck's debut.Anyone who gives this album 1 star does not know what hip hop is.This album is one of the greatest debuts in hiphop history.I love every song on the album.Every hiphop fan should get a copy and won't be disappointed.THE GAME is simply HOT.
3,GAME IS LAME!!! W/O 50 Cent,"Ok, people need to stop acting as if GAME would be as hot if he wasnt signed under G Unit for his 1st Album. I mean, look at the other scrap albums he dished out and got NO LOVE.GAME is LAME b/c he was all on 50's lap before he blew up. After he got a little fame he tried to blow up on 50 the way 50 did on a lot of other Cats in the Rap game. The difference: ""Never bite the hand that feeds you.."""
1,He Sucks Donkey D..... you no the rest,bought this cd thinking it was going to be tight dude can rap better than 50 but he sucks himself I hate hes from the west cmon and the only reason why his cd sold is because 50 has so many people that love him and brought it just because he next cd will flop big time hey doctor dre drop this cat
3,Naaaaaaaaw,"The only reason to buy this is cd is to apreciate the beats. Other than in West Side Story, Game's lyrics are garbagge. Without the beats no one would say anything good about The Documentary. The only lyrics worth anything in the Cd are those of other rappers. If 50 didn't create hype about him this cd would sell ...."
2,THE GAME HAS NO GAME,"I like the direction, nice bass. but stutter-step lyrics. You will ALWAYS, every song hear something with reference to 50 cent, Dre, an Impala, rimz. [...] First of all, get off this, you can't compare tupac to the game because the game has been rapping for 2 yrs. Don't get me wrong it has some bumpin' beats but the MC skills are just not there. B**** here, impala there, check the ""Lace my Air Ones up, put my gun up/I don't need that I'm riding wit Dre/Who don't love us, every hood throwin they dubs up/Who the f--- yall thought was comin after Young Buck/hip hops worst nightmare, Mr. Gangsta Rap is back in black nike airs/You want war, we can settle it right here/I got a squad, E-V-E and Busta Rhymes yeah/Or you could give me ya b*--, her with the light hair/Sit her next to these yellow bottles, tea right there/Matter fact I'll take you in the back/"". STAY AWAY FROM IT, the sujet matter girls, lowriders etc get old real quick.you in the hat, and you in the blue and the black"
3,2nd best g unit album after Young Buck.,Still think g-unit is garbage. Still they do know who to recruit. Producers who will put top notch beats for these so so mc's to rhyme over. Still cop it from a buddy. Listen first before runnin out and buying. I don't expect much from them so when they do surprise like on young bucks cd then no problem. This one is the 2nd best g unit album after young bucks.
3,Game: The Documentary,"I never did actually purchase this album but I have listened to it before when one of my friends got it. If I would've listened to this album just once I would've given this album a 4/5. But after you hear it a few times it starts to grow on you. He repeats himself way to much, he talks about old school rappers and his Air Forces way to much. He has no meaning or message behind any of his songs except for the normal content that would expect for a commercial hip hop album. This was a decent album overall but I don't think it lived up to the hype and expectations. To me he's just another member of G-Unit. (Not anymore though, 50 kicked him out, LOL) I would suggest this album only to obsessed G-Unit fans."
2,HOT BEATS THATS IT,"The game is overrated. the only thing worth recommending is cuz of the beats. game can't flow and says nothing in his lyrics. in the song we aint feat eminem, the game even says ""how can i not sell a million rapping over dre beats?"" at least he knew why his album would sell."
1,This Album was and is still is pretentious.,"Despite that I Think the game did the right thing by leaving that horrible group (gay-unit), this pretentious and mean-spirited and boring album is still not enough for me to recommend.Although the album has great beats, it's ruined by really terrible rapping, poorly written lyrics and the other cover in which game put his own baby in is a rip-off of ready to die.Just because many people jump in the bandwagon and gave 4 and 5 stars doesn't mean it's good, because it's still not good, even when he's left G-Unit.Although I Give him credit for leaving that group, this album is still silly.The Documentary is the most overrated album of 2005 and it's also a low rent predicable version of Straight outta ComptonThumbs Down for Me on the Documentary.Album Rating: * 1/2 Stars."
4,"From a HipHop, not Rap, Head","I wasnt gonna give dude a shot based upon the single w/ 50, but I had to move in my homies truck and he had the CD so I gave it a shot, I was presently suprised, he has some witty lines and of course the beats are bangin'. If you are a ""west coast g"" ya gotta love this album, yeah he does a bunch of name dropping but it is in context with the name of the album ""The Documentary"", in essence this is a concept album documenting is come up and industry ish he went thru. I cannot front this album is worth picking up."
5,Black Wall Street,"The game killed it, as he did on all of his other mixtapes this was no different. My boy told me about him in late 2003 i have been listening to him and the rest of black wall street since then, they are amazing, pick up his other mixtapes to hear some real tight tracks some are better than this cd, but it is worth buying if you want to hear some quality tracks...B's UP"
4,Put you on the game.,"Overall, this is a great CD. The only problem i have with this CD are some of the disappointing beats that go with ill flows. Put you on the game is the number one song here, followed by Dreams. This is a pretty good cd to be played from start to finish, but isnt something you walk away feeling compelled by. Worth Paying for."
1,The Documentary of a Junkyard.,The Game is whack how is he gangsta hes a blood then a crip then black wallstreet. he's just mad cause 50 dont give a f*ck about him anymore. Now he fell off he was never anybody till g-unit helped lift his sorry A$$ career hes a wanksta. G-unit!!!!!
5,Forget 5 stars...how about 5 mics !!!,"There is not really a whole lot I can say about this album that hasn't been said a thousand times by the other writers. This album is CRACK !!! Almost continuous play with no skips with the exception of the ""We Aint"" and ""Put You On the Game"". Eminem needs to leave the producing to the producers, and Timbaland is getting more and more whack every year. ( minus the track ""Potion"" he did for Luda ). Anyway...with the impressive list of forementioned super producers, it would ALMOST be impossible to fail. Personally I would have x'ed Timbo off the list and added 9th Wonder. The album is crazy though, not a classic, but crazy. West, Havoc, Hi-Tek, and Dre produced the hottest tracks on the album hands down. GET THIS ALBUM NOW !!!"
2,nope,"the game's delivery is half-decent and dre's beats are hot, but overall, the game doesnt come close to his hype. the cat is little more than a studio gangster: he's never killed anyone (note: not that this is a bad thing!), but still fronts with a tear-drop tattoo to try and rack up the street cred. i mean, come on, he was on the tv show ""change of heart"" a few years ago (seriously)!!! how hard can he be? plus, all he talks about is how he got shot. do you know what he was shot over? TWO POUNDS OF WEED! HAHA!!! who the heck shoots someone over weed???? IT IS ALL AN ACT!overall, you can tell he lacks skills simply because he is the biggest name-dropper i have ever heard. every other word on this cd is either ""dre"" or ""50"". simply pathetic."
4,Game could sell with or without G-Unit,Hip hop at its best. I can tell that there was alot of time put into this LP.
1,G-Unit is a horror,"G-Unit is terrible.Young Buck is arreted, Lloyd Banks can't rap, 50 is only selling cd's because of mtv,I give him 2 more years then he's done,now this guy Game comes in to ruin it all.How can a playa who's not in the game can be called the game.this guy must be stupid.then that song with eminem is terrible.I download that mothaf*cka for free because a friend told that this cd s*cks like hell"
4,"The Game's ""Documentary"" solid solo effort","supposedly rapping since 2001, getting shot, and being put into a coma, he decideds to make the album titled ""The Documentary"". On a musical standpoint it is genius work by kanye west produced ""dreams"", just blaze with two tracks (chruch for thugs, no more fun and games), Dr.Dre and eminem of course and a suprisingly good track by Hi-Tek (Runnin'). Yes he does drop a few too many names but he is a good story teller, something that these up and coming artist cannot do anymore. For his first effort its very good with the best production on any album made by the g-unit crew. He has enough to hone his craft and hopefully the fame wont go to his head which has happened to many artists"
2,5 Star's For Production 2 stars on lyrics!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Well the production on this album is BOMBBBBB!!!!! Game Didn't bring the west coast back the west been here just listen to xzibit's weapons of mass destruction. Well back to the game his lyrics arnt nothing special all he raps about is his airforces in every song the scuffs on his airforces that he gonna lace his air force one's up or that his homeboy got killed for his airforces etc etc... and yada yada and Dre should just stick to westcoast rappers cuz if u really look at it aftermath is a east coast label and 50 cent didnt do nothing special to this album either well im outt cop the album for the beats and not cuz of 50 or the lyrics..
2,The Game,"I ain't a kid, but I was too lazy to sign up. N-e-way, in my opinion the album is aight. Its really nothing special. Some of the lyrics or pretty good and some of the lyrics are bull. I mean he's basically talking ish about other people and it sounds so fake. I'm not sure if he really is a good writer, since 50 wrote the hot joints on his album like ""how we do"". The beats aren't all that either. All in all I give the album a 2.5/5. If ur lookin' for a hot rap album, this isn't really it. It's a typical rap cd in which usually 3 songs are good and the rest are wack."
3,dude has talent but...,"overhyped...he is NOT the west coast's saviour. He IS good and will get better. But his style does not represent the funky-colorful flow of the westcoast (see Daz, Sly Boogie, Xzibit, Shade Sheist, Westside Connection). Other than his lyrics referencing to westcoast culture, very little of his sound is Westcoast oriented.As well, way too much 50 cent for a westcaost cd. In fact, there is not ONE collaboration with a fellow westcoast MC (do not count the Dr.Dre, since he does not rap on the cd, nor the ""hookman"" Nate Dogg).Why no Snoop? Dub C? or Ice Cube? But, yet he has 50, yayo, Eminem, and even Busta Rhymes.I hope he does more work with westcoast artists and producers in the future, if he's REALLY trying to help the westcoast cause.Not Dre's best work either. Lacks the g-funk and bounce that makes his work sell like hotcakes."
4,The Documentaryy...yes or no????,"first of all lemme say that this one of the best cds i have heard in a while including nas's streets disciple. The Game has his own style of rap and people dont understand that..well i guess haters never learn...the best song on here is Start from scratch""...it is str8 illl...listen cop this cd it is worth it and Dont HATE...peace"
4,Alan is superb,"Alan Rickman is one of the best and most subtle actors out there. He perfects every performance, no matter the movie. Snow Cake is no exception. The film itself is on the slow side, and truly, not much happens. But it works because of the magnificent performances. Sigourney Weaver is truly great in the role of a high functioning autistic woman and Carrie-Anne Moss gives a small but interesting performance as the woman that attracts Alan's attention. The scenes between them made me forget exactly how old Alan Rickman is. Just hot. This movie may not be for everyone because like I mentioned, it is very slow, but if you like watching brilliant acting and a film with a sweet message, you will surely like this film."
4,"Dirge-like, but high quality","Odd couple flick with an autistic woman and a man who never smiles, indeed, is the most morose man in the world. Great script, great soundtrack. I didn't believe the love interest between the man and the neighbor, but whatever. The ending is a bit dragged out, and the funeral is a tear-jerker, of course."
4,The Water Nymph review,I loved this book. I read all 418 pages in 2 days. Sophie and Crispin made and attracting couple. All the romance with a murder mystery added. This is one book that I will read again and enjoy just as much as I did the first time.
1,Don't Bother,"I have to say that this is one of the worst books I have ever read. It is the perfect cure for insomnia. I fell asleep within 15 minutes of each reading. The characters were shallow and unrealistic. I found myself rereading parts just to keep things straight. I could not visualize the settings when reading and I found situations to be hokey. Save your money. If you want to give it a chance, check it out from the library!"
1,Don't Bother,"I don't believe this book even deserves one star! I have to say that this is one of the worst books that I have ever read. I fell asleep within 15 minutes of each reading. It is a great cure for insomnia. The characters are bland and unrealistic. I found myself rereading parts to just keep things straight. The writing jumped all over the place and you don't get much of a consistant flow. I could not get a visual sense of the scenes as they played out. I am very disappointed that I spent good money on this drivel. I gave this book to my dog as a chew toy. If you would like to read something from an exceptional talent, read anything written by Kristin Hannah."
4,Many excellent recipes,"There are some excellent recipes in this book. There are also a few that didn't work out so great. Overall, it is a very nice book. My kids have enjoyed trying all the recipes. One son wants to steal my copy of this book, so I will have to buy another copy for myself.As a hint, the best recipe I've ever tasted in the category of ""special"" chocolate chip cookies is called ""Chocolate Oatmeal Roundup Cookies"" - with roasted chopped peanuts, peanut butter, oats, cocoa powder and chocolate chips all combined for an ""out of this world"" cookie - from the book ""Death By Chocolate Cookies"", by Marcel Desauliers."
4,Tea for Men,I am quite surprised that this tea actually works! I have tried other products this one does what it says it wii do.
3,Great Product,This product is great and works as advertised. However the packaging is horrible. They use these extremely sticky labels that tear the plastic bag.Great product but packaging needs a lot of work.
2,sent wrong one,I ordered the purple one and got this one it was a Xmas present so I didn't have time to ship it back
4,Car wax,Good affordable product that does a good job of removing oxidation and bringing out a shine.
1,bad recording,"very bad recording, bad picture, sound and have many unnecesary record parts, the histories are worst than I remember, this need to be remasterized"
4,Great practice with many options.,"My husband and I do yoga with this DVD at home together. It is a nice routine with many options. We like to choose our workout with the matrix. The first few times with the DVD are a little hard because Shiva moves between postures very quickly and sometimes it is confusing. Once you've gone through it once or twice, it is great."
1,less whispering more action please,"the matrix is great and I wish it were available in other DVD's that I use (I'm a big Lotte Berk fan) but for those of us who're more focused on the ""bottom"" line, this DVD's style is way too abstract. If you're like me, you're probably not looking for poetry buried in vague/meaningless instructions like ""feel the earth's fire in your core"". This is a workout you'll probably do at home so the beach scene, the tides sweeping from both sides(!) the sweet-soft whisperings (!!!) of the instructions make this one a great waste of what might otherwise have been a very to-the-point and no-nonsense workout. Shiva's flexibility and control are very inspiring but you may feel cheated when you can't follow a decent sequence with that inspiration to get your own results."
3,Too fast for beginners,"As stated elsewhere, you must preview this video a few times in order to understand the verbal clues Shiva is giving. You cannot watch the TV and participate in the Yoga training easily.Good points:Shiva gives optional poses during her routines, one for beginners, one for intermediates and one for advanced yogis. So you can grow with this video. Once you are flexible enough and know the poses so that you can move quickly from one to the other, you will have a very good workout. The 4 standard workouts are good. You have two beginner workouts; a 30 min. basic flow and an hour plus lunar flow. Plus you have the longer solar 1 and 2 workouts for intermediates.Not so good pointsThe matrix is a good idea but the flow of movement and breathing from selection to selection is interrupted by the start-up music and title of the next. Production is a bit spotty, especially if you are used to Rodney Yee."
2,Not What I Was Hoping For,"I was introduced to yoga through a group class at my rec. I fell in love with it and really enjoyed the full body, relaxing experience. With all the great reviews of this DVD, I thought I might continue my passion for yoga in the comfort of my own home. Sadly this DVD was not what I wanted. I enjoy the physical aspects of yoga but this DVD tended to focus a lot more on the spiritual than I am comfortable with. My own personal beliefs cause me to feel uneasy about the depth this DVD went into with the spiritual part of yoga. I'm just looking for a good invigorating yoga DVD. Shiva Rea wanted me to buy into the entire spiritual concept of yoga and its roots and that is just not my cup of tea."
2,wow she shore is purdy!,"Yeah, I'm a red blooded American male and I fell for the pretty woman on the cover. The yoga routines are not so great. I would recomend YogaZone videos. That Alan Finger guy is a real teacher at heart. His instructers are also great if you get one of the ones led by them. From what I have seen. they are really the best for beginning to intermediate."
2,Do be careful,"This video is visually stunning. There are segments which are extremely challenging and rapid without any attention to good form. Definitions of ""beginner, intermediate, advanced,"" are not well defined. I put segments which were beyond my ability level into my workout and my carelessness contributed to a knee injury."
5,Outstanding Yoga DVD,"This DVD is worth every penny. It is beautifully shot, and the matrix is such an amazing tool that it is as if I had bought 8 or 9 DVDs. The preset flows are outstanding and range from beginner to intermediate poses. These account for 4 hours of instruction, plus every set of flows is included in the matrix so you can customize the workouts to work for you. To add to the mix, Yoga Shakti offers a feature to play only music with the flows. This video is really a great buy for anyone who is interested in ashtanga or power yoga and who really would like to take the time to work on themselves. I am very happy with this product."
5,Excellent,"This is the best yoga dvd I've ever used. Her demonstrations are clear and instructions unobstrusive. Some of the exercises do require equipment however, which I do not have. The variety of workouts is really great."
4,Great yoga video,"I've only been doing yoga for a few months and was using one of those 10 Minute Solution videos prior to this one. Like many have said, there are some difficult things on here but yoga isn't easy...you slowly work up to those poses/practices. I don't even use the matrix aspect of this DVD because I am new to yoga but I know that as I progress I will."
3,Not quite the perfect book,"In The Night Room was my first introduction to Straub. Admittedly, I didn't do research before picking up this book which probably adds to my frustration and confusion. I wish I had read lost boy lost girl first as many of the references and imagery took me too long to pick up reading this book first. Many interesting points made my mind wonder and at some points sadly wander but as a whole, an interesting book. Intriguing enough to make me want to pick up more Straub to see what he truly can do (ie lost boy lost girl) but not good enough to make me rush out and buy his whole collection."
4,"Love Whoopi, Love her BOOK.","Past reviews have called BOOK over the top, which it is. Her views outrageous... to some they might be. Liberal? Of course. I agree with all of her opinions; I am extremely proud to be called a Liberal and I'm pretty sure Whoopi is too.I'm Catholic but her opinions of the popes, both past and present, are totally on the mark and not offensive to anyone who has any awareness of what's going on in Rome. Read with an open mind. Whether you agree or not, Ms. Goldberg's opinions will freshen up your thoughts on a lot of subjects.It does ramble on like one of her stand-up monologues, which is what I love so much about it. I also recommend the audiobook version so you can hear Whoopi reading her own words.This is not high literature, I admit. But it is fresh and humorous and one of my all-time fun reads. I even named my web site after her cute name for a fart. Tree Monkey . Net"
2,Just not funny,"Whoopi Goldberg, like so many comedians, apparently thinks that the so-called dirty words are funny, per se, in whatever context. In this case, they simply aren't amusing, except to the snickering adolescent. She is a fine actress, and I have laughed at some of her wit in stand-up routines. Perhaps something goes out of them when reduced to paper and read by someone who is cold sober. Ultimately humor has to have something to say about the human condition, and she doesn't have much to say that is beyond a perfect grasp of the obvious. That is sad."
2,Disappointing!,"I was extremely anxious to read this book but was disappointed when I finally did. Perhaps I was expecting too much but most of the book seemed to be rehashed from interviews, articles and monologues. I was expecting to be illuminated or something. I'm still a diehard Whoopi fan but will probably wait until the next book comes out in paperback!"
2,Got sick of it,"Ok, I was into this book, I really was! Whoopi has a humorous point of view on a lot of different topics. I had to keep in mind that the book was written in 1998, but besides that it started out pretty good...then I kept reading, and reading, and reading the same thing over and over and over again.I got a bit more than halfway through before getting really sick of her whining and complaining and just put the book down. If I want to hear whining I'll go tease my dog."
2,Painting the Impressionists Landscape.,Useless book. I did not find anything new in this book. It was waste of money and will not recommend.
3,Bad dubbing!,"The voice dubbing on the film is horrific. It's like watching a bad karate movie. There mouths are moving, but the words don't come out until a few seconds later."
5,Bringing the Fun Back to Metal,"Birdflesh single handedly saved me from becoming bored with the Grindcore genre. Outstanding songs, with some outstandingly interesting lyrics. Reading the booklet is half the fun."
1,Worthless,"This product is great at killing mosquitoes, after they bite the heck out of you. If you are looking to stop mosquitoes, as I was and this bulb was categorized as an anti-mosquitoe bulb, then look somewhere else.This bulb doesn't keep bugs of any kind away, it just kills them after a while. Big dissapointment, especially for $14."
2,Evvy's Civil what....?,"I read Evvy's Civil War at the age of 10. This book was written for ages 12 and up. By the fifth chapter I was board to death! Finally at chapter 24/29 I started to kind of warm up to this book. Don't underestimate me for only being 10, but don't overestimate this book. The author could at least have put more description about Evvy in the book. If you would like to read a good historical fiction book try reading a book by one of the following authors....Lauri Halse Anderson, Recommended: Fever 1793Anne Rinaldi, Recommended: A Break With CharityKathleen Benner Duble, Recommended: The SacrificeAnne Isaacs, Recommended: Torn ThreadJoan M. Wolf, Recommended: Someone Named EvaLouis Lowery Recommended: Number the Stars"
2,wrong belt sent; issue still unresolved,"Ordered push button belt; was sent the airplane style. Contacted company, still no resolution on this issue. Maybe someone else will have better luck."
3,the sewing machine that needs to be recalled,"I thought gee! what a great idea, a barbie sewing machine. I still think it's a great idea but from a company that knows how to make them! This machine works great as long as you do not turn it on!! For hand stitching and buttons it's great and for fixing little barbie seams it's great, but if you turn it on beware!!! The machine will take off on it's own and start sewing up everything in sight. I haven't put it on fast yet (too afraid). Slow is like race horse speed, just never mind fast. Used as a little girls sewing machine, that doesn't use electricity or batteries, it's great. Just don't turn the switch to on.If Mattel had used a different reliable company it would be a little girls dream machine. So Mattel if you're reading this (which you will cause I'm sending it to you) please recall this and have a company that knows what they are doing make it."
1,Should be Recalled - Don't even spend a buck on it.,"Please believe all these reviews. I purchased a lot of 15 of these machines for $30, and I don't have the conscience to sell a single one. I spent 30 minutes trying three different machines, and every single one wouldn't work past one stitch. It's not the user -- it's the machine. I went to this site to confirm it wasn't me, and as you can see from the other reviews...it's the machine. I wish it DID work -- such a neat idea for the little ones."
2,Frustrating!,"My daughter received this toy for Christmas and it's been a very frustrating experience. As an experienced quilter and seamstress, I wasn't expecting to sit down and sew a quilt using this machine, but I was at least expecting to be able to sew more than six stitches before the thread got all jumbled up and became a mess. The tension adjustment on this thing leaves much to be desired -- after over half an hour of playing around with it, I still haven't got it quite right -- but I do have a terrific headache! I really just want her to have something to learn the absolute basics on before she graduates to my old sewing machine, but it looks like I should have just gone for the real thing to start with. Take my advice, if you are a parent who sews, just use your own machine to teach your child or purchase an old used one. Your child will enjoy the time spent actually sewing much more than mine is enjoying the time standing by while I try to figure out the tension on this darn thing!"
5,Do Not Pass This Up!!,"Paul Lepore has written the definitive resource for anyone seeking a career in the highly competitive Fire Service. His books will assist the serious candidate in setting and achieving realistic goals, making good educational and training decisions, and preparing for nearly every eventuality in the most critical step of the hiring process, the oral interview. This is a must-have for the serious firefighter candidate!"
2,There's a reason it was 1 season,"After 4 episodes I pulled the plug. Yes some funny situations but lots of ""inside"" jokes, repeated jokes, mumbled delivery. Stiller +company have definitely improved since then!"
3,An average rehashing of what has already been done,"If you are looking for a ""cliff notes"" version of the vampire myth, then this is a pretty simple, easy to use book. For those just developing an interest in vampire legend and lore, it will offer a very general overview of the nature of the vampire legacy. However, true students of vampirism will quickly bore of this book, as it doesn't really offer anything new or groundbreaking. In fact, with a careful Google search, you can probably find the same info for free on the internet."
4,WONDERFUL PICTURES,THIS BOOK IS USEFUL TO THOSE WHO ARE SERIOUS POTTERY COLLECTORS. THE PICTURES ARE WONDERFUL AND UP CLOSE TO REALLY SEE THE PIECE. IT TELLS YOU ABOUT THE PIECES PICTURED IN DETAIL DOWN TO THE WEIGHT. SELLING MY COPY AS I NO LONGER NEED IT.
5,A Special Providence,"A sensitively written chronicle of two lives in parallel, based on the author's own life experiences. The war scenes are stirring and have an authentic air about them that only someone who has experienced war first hand could convey. Despite the fact that Yates himself expressed disappointment with this work, I was surprised to find it so gripping. I highly recommend this book to anyone who admires Richard Yates based on his more famous novel, Revolutionary Road."
2,Written by a manger for managers,"I was able to go cover to cover in about 5 minutes. If you manage people that use their brains to do their work and you have no idea how to understand, manage and motivate them then this book might help you out a bit. I found it to be off-topic for me as I was hoping that it was going to be written for the people who Think for a Living rather than their managers."
3,"KEN RUSSELL SAID: ""THIS IS MY BEST FILM"" WHY?","Adapted from D. H. Lawrence's novel, this is really a prequel to the Lawrence novel WOMEN IN LOVE that Russell directed two decades earlier. Interestingly, Glenda Jackson plays the mother of the character she portrayed in the previous film. It's rather muddled drama, nowhere near the artistry of Russell's earlier adaptation, even with its nudity and central lesbian affair. This film is not yet available on home video in the USA. Strangely, Russell is said to have considered this his best film."
4,quick note on this release,"This version, this region 2 release is, in fact, NOT widescreen. It is 1.33 to 1.Anybody know of a widescreen release?"
5,Most comprehensive and easy to read,"As a nurse I can say that this book is the eaiest to read and most comprehensive, sane and sound on the topic of baby and child care. No extremes and a lot of support an respect for parents. I kind of know all that stuff being a nurse but I think it will help my husband with our first baby who is about to be born any day. My husband doesn't know anything about child care and I think this will be a valuable resource for him.As for shipment and condition - it arrive on time and the book (I bought used) was in great shape. So I definitely recommend this seller."
5,Love It!! Very Informative,"I actually borrow this book from my local library. I am quite amazed by Dr. Spock's insight. I know and I've read so many times that each baby has its own unique development. But somehow Dr. Spock explains it in a different way. He also explores the importance of non-physical development, things that we missed on daily basis just because we are too busy comparing other babies are chubbier. Admit it mom!This book covers different stages of child development. So I don't read all of them at once, only on the sections that relate to my baby's current progress.Dr. Spock's suggestion is ""TRUST YOURSELF"". He believes mom knows the unique needs of her baby, and when the world-known pediatrician told you that .. what more can you say?"
5,I absolutely love it,"I am a medical student and sometimes (usually) time is very limited. I was at Target the other day and saw this thermos and said what the heck and picked it up. Let me tell you, it is one of the best investments EVER. It is very sturdy when you put it down because it has a rubber piece on the bottom lessening the posibility of it slipping. The cup (cap) is large enough to pour a nice size drink for yourself. This morning I put my hot tea in there and it is not 8 hours later and I still need to let it cool down before I drink. I highly recommend this for tea/coffee lovers that just don't have time (or money) to go out and buy everytime you want a hot drink."
4,who knew....,"I wasn't sure about this novel when I purchased it, I'm a sci-fi fan and I didn't know if this would fulfill my imaginative fix.... but it did. I read the entire text in 16 hours and wanted more. I found the historic connections smart and meaningful, the cultural landscape amazing (as a descendant of Barbados thus one of Tituba's cultural descents), and Tituba's voice was beautifully forceful.... A great read!!!"
5,awesome book,"I loved this book. My father told me about it because he read the French version and convinced me to get the English translation. The journey of Tituba was very captivating, sad, and inspirational. Being that I'm of Haitian descent I related quite well with the knowledge that she acquired to use nature to help her with her many endeavors. The ending was quite sad for me becuase the changes that I had hoped for didn't happen. But then again, given the time it was to be expected. I'm now reading ""Crossing the Mangrove,"" which is also written by Maryse Conde. Unfortunately I'm finding this one a bit on the boring side."
3,Falters in spots,"The book seemed too heavy on the isms. For example, the insertion of Hester Prynne seemed unnecessary, clumsy and contrived to the point of breaking the spell."
5,Another great book by Maryse Conde!,Loved this book. Couldn't put it down. Tituba's relationship with Hester Prynne was exquisite. She is an amazing author.
2,"II, Tituba",I did NOT care for the underlines and comments written in pen throughout the book and now will think twice about buying used
3,Poor volume,"The movie was great, and some of the best music ever, in my opinion. However, the volume is VERY low. Even with the volume up all the way on the surround sound system, it was barely audible."
4,Interesting Documentary,"In ""The Search for Reality"" ( Michael Wiese Productions, 1997) Dale Bell (who received an Oscar for the film) describes the incredible issues that faced the documentarians who made Woodstock from getting the film, to getting the camera crews in place and editing multicamera shots with improvised means. As a document of film history it is invaluable. It also shows that a film is made for its time. You would have to have been there to watch the whole thing with unrelenting enthusiasm. The music is great. In the middle of our current wars, we may need another Woodstock, although the filming and editing would be much easier."
1,Short on extras,"I was expecting much more from this special edition. The only extra was a short infomercial for the Museum at Bethal Woods. No commentaries, not supplementary concert footage, not even a trailer. Lame."
5,Very good documentation of Woodstock,"It was a very good realization of Woodstock. It showed everything as it happened with nothing censored. The editing was done very well, in the sense that they added music and scenes together to get a better picture. I couldn't believe how real it seemed. It will always be a classic to watch the revolutionary society as it was back then."
4,woodstock,"excellent document of a historic happening, perhaps this cut is a bit rigorous but it does speed up things nicely."
5,"Can you still say ""groovy"" in 2009?","Just got this last night, and I have to say it's stunning. I purchased Woodstock as an excuse to purchase a blu-ray player, and I'm happy I did. The colors pop, you see detail you never saw in the original DVD.And yes, some of the songs have been ""repaired"" with added instrumentation, which I have NO PROBLEM WITH. I suppose it would be immoral if they didn't tell us they did it. But they told us. They even made a video to show the process, which is pretty amazing.So quit complaining and turn it up!And oh yeah, groovy.Kaz"
5,awsome!,"This documentary was brilliantly filmed. The split screen although not new to filming was a great was to show how much was going on at once. The music made my feet tap and my head bounce, it was great. It captured the mood and feelings of the young people of America trying to break through old ways. The first Woodsotck was the best most creative, spirtual, and nonviolent of all time. There will never be another repeat. I can watch it over and over and never get sick of seeing a culture changing infront of me!"
4,jim,"i own this on laserdisc but the dvd in 5.1 dolby digital is far better. classic performances include: santana - soul sacrifice, joe cocker - with a little help from my friends. my only complaint is not enough of csny, the who, santana and sly and the family stone. and too much boreing footage."
5,Part of an Era!,"Needless to say, I'm of the 60's era. It's been fun to watch all the 40th anniversay specials aired in '09, and this dvd really captured the sentiment of the time."
2,So-so.....,"I had mixed feelings on this. The music was real good and I'm sure that they did the best they could with what they had to work with back in that time period. However, the split screen stuff was just really annoying. There were really good things going on with both screens but you could only follow one lest you lose your place on that one by following the other. It was like watching 2 TV's at the same time and trying to keep up with both stories. It was OK, but if I could do it all over again, I would not have bought it."
1,Squawky,The performances have a mostly squawky sound which ruins the disk on the whole. Very poor conception of Haydn's Mass style and extremely poor understanding of the pacing of ecclesiastical works.
5,Love that Judy Carne,"A great show, loved so much about it, especially that adorable little pixie with the Cockney accent and very sexy legs. Her unforgettable line was when she was wearing a wig and it was blown off, leaving her bald. She looks into the camera and says ""Gee, I never thought I'd be balled on TV"" They somehow got it past the censors by convincing them that the audience would assume she was saying ""bald"". And her trademark saying, ""Sock it to me"" was obviously meant to mean ""Put it to me"", a Cockney sexual expression."
2,Only watchable if you turn the sound off!,"This was a gift. I recall watching this in my high school years. The humor?? especially enduring Dick Martin is pretty lame. I tried watching them all and I just couldn't. The visual especially Goldie is its only saving grace. If you are nostalgic I would highly recommend purchasing ""All in the Family"" or ""the Jeffersons"" DVD sets."
5,I Like It,"This is the first card software I have purchased and will probably be the last. I can't imagine needing anything more to create these types of projects. The graphics are excellent and the interface is very user friendly. I did have one support question and it was answered quickly and easily with a short phone call. Phone support is of paramount importance when buying software or hardware and though Nova's phone support isn't free, it was quick and effective. It is unlikely most people will need support with this software because it runs so smooth and nice. But it's nice to know it's there. I have developed the habit of sending my wife electronic cards every day and she loves them. They make her day at work a little more pleasant. I really like this software and highly recommend it."
2,A Waste of Time,"90% of the graphics and the templates are cheesy and ugly and old fashioned, look like the cheapest cards you get at the stock clearing sales. Only for those don't mind to spend an hour on a card - either have to do it from scratch or edit a lot from the templates just to make the card looks decent enough to send to your loved ones. Plus you can't make any scrapbook pages!!"
1,RAGE,I sit at my computer trying to think of what these guys were trying to do by naming their album CHINESE DEMOCRACY. WHY? I have been waiting for the real Chinese Democracy album for a VERY LONG TIME! I wish Axl would personally slap every member of this group.
3,Its an ok deck,"I was attracted to this deck because of its reference to travels abroad and the silk road; however upon receiving it I became disappointed with it and I am not exactly sure why. I guess this deck will be attractive to those interested in Marco Polo and his journey. Otherwise, the images in the cards are very pretty, the card stock is fairly decent and the deck is longer than wider. I have not tried to become more familiar with this deck besides initial observations, maybe in the future."
2,Great quality DVD,Poor series. After seeing The Wire this looks like an amatuer show. Not fond of cops or cop shows so thst says it all. While it may have been a critically acclaimed series it just did not work for me.
3,new life for homicide,"Don't get me wrong, Homicide is a 5 star show, unfortunately this DVD is plagued with poor image quality and some sound glitches. As well it would have been nice to have more commentary from the creators. I like to get more incite into how the show was created and so forth. Besides the image flaws it's nice to have the show finally on DVD. If you do like the show I recommend the set."
3,Could have been much better as a silent film,"This film missed the boat but not by much. Not a high budget film by any means, it at least tries to preserve the book written by H.G. Wells. Where it misses is not the cgi as it is filmed more like a graphic novel, which is not a bad concept but the dialog delivered by the characters just does not work, their acting style is more suitable for the silent era. I think had this film been done in silent format it would have been much better received, everything would have clicked. But still it is far more true to the book than anything else that has been done."
1,like water torture in solitary - Excruiating Tedium,"Unending, multi-minute long long and completely static shots of absolutely nothing. ""Mood"" painted by empty halls, grimy back rooms, and hollow dark spaces. Lighting ranges from dim and smokey to dark and dank. Extremely spare, nearly nonexistent and absurdist dialog. Zero plot or point. The stone cold, broken and filthy bathroom tiles in the ""urinal"" scene have more soul and warmth than this film.Zero character development, and less than zero interest in any ""character"" in this film. Actually there are no characters, only zombie-like warm (?) bodies occupying a few scenes.A promising premise goes nowhere and elicits no emotion except extreme, painfully monotonous tedium.Watching steaming cow dung cool for two hours would be more interesting and elicit more emotion than this film.Truly one of the worst theater experiences I have ever been subjected to."
3,the prodigal sorcerer,I had expected more from this book it had a real high rating and I thought the main character was supposed to be the sorcerer building his magic powers finished it quick but was let down with the end
3,lunch box,its a cute lunch box but it's quite small. There isn't enough room for a my childs whole lunch in the box.
4,Honest movie opinion,I choose this movie because it's a movie that I can relate too going threw my teen years in the early 90's.
3,well paced drama cant give it 3 1/2 stars so i give it 3,"One thing i hope know you guys might have picked up on was at the end when bishop was afraid to die and was yelling at Q to not let go of him. Going against what Bishop had said previously about goin out in a blaze of glory.I think the story was about Bishop who was trying too hard to get respect by being harder then he really was. Q knew this and obviously knew a different side to Bishop which was why he was trying to squash the beef when he threw his gun away. Bishop however wouldnt realise this untill the end. Its a great story which i think could have been told better instead of portraying Bishop as a out of control lunatic, they could hav given us more detail as to why Bishop was so unforgiving. He was missing the human side that we all know Tupac Shakur possessed which is what separates the two."
2,Crappy Fighting,I am a huge MMA Fan and I usually enjoy the cheap older MMA DVD's. This is usually the only way to see today's superstars before they became known. The fights on the DVD are horrible. The only semi-large name fighter on the card is Marvin Eastman and his fight looked very amateurish. My advices is to skip this DVD.
1,a disappointment & a waste of $40,"At first, i was very excited about this game because i own Sonic Adventure2: Battle, which is one of the best games ever in my opinion. After i bought this game, i tried it out. Although the graphics are awesome, the storyboard, controls and level of difficulty were horrible. I could barely even beat the first level it was so hard. These are my final ratings:1: Graphics: 1 star2: storyboard: No stars3: level of difficulty: no stars4: controls: no stars5: overall:no starsif you have $40 to spend on video games, don't buy this one!"
1,Don't be fooled like I was!,"Don't make the mistake I did and think that this is the same Daivid Gilmour from Pink Floyd-- it's not the same person! Take note of the spelling of the last name.I can't believe that amazon.com would associate this albumn with other albumns of David Gilmour. Shame on you amazon.com! The only reason I purchased this albumn was because you guys ""associated"" it with other albums of David Gilmour from Pink Floyd. Very bad indeed. Where do I get my money back!"
3,A garage rock classic,"Leslie West has to be one of the least talented people ever to become a rock star. He can't sing and he can't play guitar all that well, at least when compared to most of his contemporaries. Having said all that, I have to admit that after 30 years this record still sounds good, its ragged edges notwithstanding. Most of the songs are written in collaboration with Felix Papallardi and Gail Collins, who co-wrote many of Cream's best tunes, and Papallardi plays a heavy fuzz-bass similar to the style Jack Bruce used in Cream's performances.This line-up went on to score a few hits as the group ""Mountain"". The overall sound is heavy, proto-grunge guitar rock, rather like Cream with all the production values stripped away. It's raw, it's grainy, it's sloppy in places --- and West's vocal range is limited, to put it politely --- but much of this album still works. Compared to Grand Funk Railroad, it's not half bad."
5,Great movie.,"I recieved this movie many years ago in the vhs version from my aunt, I forgot how much I love this movie becuase I put it away and 12 years passed (I am 18 now) and I decided to watch it for old time sakes. Needless to say, I feel in love with it again so I've decided to buy the dvd to ensure that my future children will have the chance to watch this masterpiece someday."
5,such an amazing drinking movie,"hi,i am a college student who just watched this film for the first time in about 10 years. i didn't remeber much of it but i had a friend who isisted that we watch it while we were drinking. she popped in the movie and i was blown away, cheesy plot, the very funny narration by everyone's favorite drunken aristocrat arthur (well dudley moore whatever). i loved when the frog was saying otis over and over. and the song the fox sang is priceless. oh yeah that reminds me the theme song is so awsome. granted there is some animal violence and such and i am normally not a fan of that, but seriously it is kinda funny to watch a cat go over a waterfall (i laughed despite my friends cat sitting next to me). honestly though, this is a very sweet movie that i highly recommend for any person who wants to have a good time while watching a movie (espically when drinking). rock on!!"
5,Milo and Otis DVD,The product arrived quickly without any problems. I would order again from this site anytime.
5,Milo and Otis is GREAT!,Milo and Otis is a great movie. I really enjoyed it. It is a wonderful movie for everyone!
1,animal abuse ... enough said,"All you have to do is watch clips online to see that many of the situations depicted in the movie were flat out cruelty. The scene where the cat was being attacked by gulls. Obvious abuse. Then the cat either jumps off the cliff in fear of his life (as the movie maker wants you to believe). Or the more plausible scenario is that the cat is tossed off the cliff which again is not ok in any way, shape, or form. Oh but they seemed to have ""lived"" through the scene huh??? Well in that case I suppose we should perform actual rapes when it is called for in filming of movies??? ... I mean after all they will obviously ""LIVE"" through it right? c'mon people use your brain. Abuse is abuse is ABUSE!"
2,OK,"I love cats and remember liking this movie as a little child, but now as an adult I found it kinda boring since it was a narrative. Probably best to show a young child and read along with the book which can be purchased separately."
4,Good Movie,"""The Adventures of Milo and Otis"" is a heart warming movie ... one of those films both the kids and parents can enjoy together.It's the story of friendship between an orange cat (Milo) and a pug dog (Otis). They meet while still a pups ... or kitten ... on a farm and are inseparable after that. Well, almost inseparable.The movie has some adorable moments of animals being with each other .... not just Milo and Otis, but ducks, deer, bear, pigs, a fox, and chickens. It takes your heart away to see this innocence.The movie gets a little bogged down toward the end. Our two little heroes get separated and it's just not as much fun. The movie maker should have kept them together the whole time (I believe).But this movie is well worth checking out."
5,Laura L Wiley,"I bought the adventures of Milo and Otis for my grandchildren as their parentswatched it as children and it became one of their favs.I can now say it is one of my grandchildrens too,I have small grandchildren and many movies frighten them,(even tho the bear sceneis scary) we told them it wont be bad,that Milo and Otis are smart and brave.I would buy this again and again.I fear our copy will soon wear out because I hearcan we watch Milo and Otis at every visit."
5,Milo and Otis,This Japanese prize winning film was made about 20 years ago. I bought it for my granddaughter in Australia.The photography is breathtaking and the dialogue (Dudley Moore) is charming. The expressions on the faces of the kitten and puppy watching a chick hatch from an egg is worth the cost of the DVD. It's a great familyfilm. I don't own any animals but these two continue to touch my heart.
5,"This is a ""must have"" book for the softball coach","I used to attend Judi Garman's softball clinics at Cal State Fullerton in the 1980's. I never went away sorry about the time spent there. Judi is a veritable fountain of knowledge about the game. Softball Skills and Drills draws from Judi's life-time of coaching experience. You'll not only find skills and drills in this book. You'll find strategy, both for offense and defense. Check out the chapters on slap-hitting and bunting. If my house was on fire, and there were only two books on fastpitch softball I could rescue, it would be Softball Skills and Drills by Garman and Fastpitch Softball: the Windmill Pitcher by Barry Sammons. If you're into fastpitch, you gotta have this book."
3,Not the greatest crayons,Saw these crayons and thought that they would be great for my 18 month old. The main thing that I am not fond of is that you have to put so much pressure on them to actually see color. They are good for my daughter to grasp with the large ball on the end. Not sure I would buy these again.
3,Urban Cowboy,"I saw the movie many years ago. This movie is a favorite of a friend, so I bought the movie for her as a birthday present."
3,"Made my hair extra dry, but my skin very soft!","I have naturally curly, coarse hair, and apparently naturally dry hair. I've only used this twice on my hair and it's made it sooo dry both times. My other natural shampoo doesn't leave my hair dry like this one, so I think I'll stick to that one. However, this works absolutely WONDERFUL as a body wash! Leaves my skin very soft, which is weird to me after drying out my hair. Whatever works."
5,Great product,"I've been using this for several years and find it a great product. All natural, and doesn't dry out my scalp. Highly recommend it."
3,OK,"I ordered this product because it is all natural and that is what I was looking for. However I was a little disappointed because it left my hair very tangled and I didn't feel it was clean. I also ordered the conditioner which worked better but still my hair was a mix of knots and a greasy feeling. I haven't been able to find an all natural shampoo that leaves my hair the way shampoos with chemicals do. I have long wavy, sometimes freezy hair and need something that moisturizes without weighing down and at the same time really cleans. This one wasn't it."
2,Did not help with my frizz!,I have 4b natural hair. It didn't help remove any frizz out of my hair. I also didn't really like the spicy smell to it. However it made my hair feel soft compare to regular shampoos.
3,Didn't help my frizzy hair,"My hair is wavy, frizzy, coarse, and dry. I thought this shampoo would help with those things. And while it didn't make my hair worse or dry out my hair, it didn't do much to help it. I was interested in a shampoo that claimed to reduce frizz, and if my hair wasn't so frizzy, I probably would have noticed more of a difference. It didn't lather at all for me. This probably was a good thing though because it means it is less harsh. I've used other natural shampoos that do lather but this one is different. I do like it though because the ingredients are all natural and it did clean my hair like shampoo is supposed to, but I wouldn't buy it again because there are many other things to try and this one could have been better."
1,not for my hair,"I am an african american woman with relaxed hair. I am always on the hunt for natural products to help my hair stay moisturized and be as nice as possible. I thought I would give this a try on my hair and my daughter (naturally curly, frizzy hair)... no can do. drying, stripping and the smell is not what i thought it would be. I don't like it at all. I don't know why it is so drying. Our hair (especially my daughter's hair) was dry as straw. thank goodness for the Protein conditioner.....it worked just OK for me, but for my daughter - ugh. I can only say for my hair it is not good at all."
3,I like it but....,"While this product works allright, I'm not sure I'm overly fond of the smell. It is definitely spicy but not necessarily in a way that most women might want. To me, it smells a lot like Old Spice which is fine for some folks but not me. It's still worth a try and doesn't way my hair down like White Camellia, but I like the smell of the Camellia shampoo and conditioner far better. This would be a great buy for any guys who want an organic shampoo for sure ^_^!"
1,"Dry, Dry, and Dry!","This shampoo did a number on my hair! My hair is curly and this product made my hair feel sooooo dry and damaged. Lets not talk about the smell, OMG! It was bad, please dont buy this stuff."
1,not good,This shampoo made my hair more oily than other shampoos. I stoped using it and bought a different shampoo which is working much better than this one.
2,WATERY,"You will have to use more then regular shampoo, because this one is very watery. Although the shampoo works great, the company should make it thicker to stay on your head when appling."
2,Horrible fragrance and doesn't do a thing for my hair,"I had high hopes for this shampoo. I used it for the first time yesterday after swimming. It does not lather. It has a strong sweet fragrance which stayed with my hair hours after using it, making me queasy and making me sneeze. It did not seem to help my hair at all; rather, my hair was dry and dull. I have very healthy shiny hair, so I can only conclude that this shampoo is not good for my hair. I won't be using it again."
5,Not your typical user,"I crochet and knit purses, yep, among a gazillion other things. Using tubing was recommended to reinforce the handles. The person who recommended this stated to use a smaller size tube because the larger the bluer tint. This tubing is perfectly clear. It was a bit tricky because I wanted the handle to be securely attached at both ends so I crocheted the length I wanted for the handle, added a few feet of yarn and cut it. After making the loop really long so it wouldn't become undone, I pushed the whole strap through the tube with a knitting needle. That was after trying all the usual suspects. lol. Then attached the other end securely to the purse and Voila!My next try I will be using rivets to attach the tubing to the purse. I haven't yet been able to afford the rivets, so I will have to get back to that later. I will have to use the ones with caps on both sides I think for it to work.There's nothing worse than a worn and dirty purse handle so cool solution."
2,Partisan writing shrouds the truth,"Porter writes as if the North was never wrong, its commanders never fooled or mistaken, its armies never disspirited, and that the Union campaigns always succeeded. We all should know better. According to Porter, every time the Confederates didn't hold a field they were ""repulsed handsomely."" Every time the Union didn't hold the field, they were merely ""compelled to retire."" You will see these gross aberrations throughout this stale and shoddy work. His characterizations add nothing fresh about the famous personages surrounding him, and certainly his military perspective offers less in quality of insight than the diary of any Union private. There are many great books on the Civil War by the figures who fought it: this one can wait until you've exhausted everything else."
4,No longer TORN,"After releasing her first single Torn, I thought to myself ""It's impossible to top this song"". Torn is by far Natalie's best song, but that doesn't mean she can't branch out into other directions and keep growing as an artist. This is exactly what she's done in her latest album, she's grown into a thought provoking artist.Natalie's vocals are in top shape, this is a huge compliment considering that she had nodules in her vocal chords that had to be surgically removed. Lyrically speaking, her work is always and continues to be poetic. The sound of her new album isn't too far from her previous efforts although, I will say that her music sounds happier here than in her last two albums. I also felt that Natalie's music was less moody, perhaps this is because of her recent marriage to Daniel Johns.I would definitely recommend Counting Down The Days to anyone who enjoys light listening and overall, Good Music.Happy listening."
2,Mediocre at best,"I heard 'torn' back in 1997, and it wasnt too bad, it was kinda good. but i heard 'shiver' a few days ago, and i almost fell asleep. What happend? the shiver chorus is just the same chords over and over again, hardly any variety in the tune.Buy red hot chili peppers or phill collins, but give this one a miss."
5,Love this!! Excellent,"Natalie is so good! I love every single song on this CD, they all are nice to listen to, they help me get my work done. She has a very distinct different voice, i'm not suprised shes popular in UK. Good luck Natalie! LOVE IT"
3,Good songs... BAD SOUND,"It's really a shame... of all of Natalie's CDs, the sound quality on this is really noticably bad... White Lillies and Left Of Middle are nearly perfect recordings. What a shame... a wall of harsh, scratchy sound and it does no justice to Natalie's voice."
2,Enjoli Perfume---too expensive,Thought I was getting 3 bottles for $100...however only received 1....totally too expensive. Live an learn. It still has the right fragrance...Think the product was a left over from the Orient.
4,Necessary evil,"What can I say. It's a typical required book for Engineering Majors. It has some pretty cool examples in the beginning, but towards the end it's a little tedious and looses touch with real world applications.It also does not do a great job at explaining shear/moment diagrams. Some other books give great examples and charts about distributed loading. That area is touched upon heavily in the EIT, or FE, exams."
5,Great little nuts for hobbies,These are great little nuts for hobbies - they are near impossible to find in stores and much cheaper than metal ones. They also are much lighter for use with lightweight RC aircraft.
1,This Edition is Crap,This review is about the edition of the book. It seems like a bootleg! It is an awfully scanned and enlarged version of an older edition.I would really recommend buying a used version over this crappy edition. In fact I might try to return this!
5,The Travels of Bing and Bob and Dottie,"The ""Road Pictures"" are among the best movies ever made. The plots are ridiculous and the characters are hilarious. Dorothy Lamour is, of course, gorgeous and glamorous and delightfully sincere in her efforts to help Bing and Bob get out of their various predicaments. ""The Road to Bali"" puts Crosby and Hope in a tropical paradise that threatens to culminate in their demise. Tartans and kilts make an unexpected appearance in a plot twist that will make your head spin. I got the distinct feeling that the Beatles watched ""The Road to Rio"" before they made ""Help."" Some of the same gags appear in both movies, which added to the zaniness for me. The Andrews Sisters drop in to sing with Bing, and a couple of dance/acrobatic acts add to the fun. Pure entertainment with lots of laughs.Barbara J. Olexer"
5,Michael and Me,It is refreshing to see a documentary based on facts. Mr. Elder went out of his way to document his findings even interviewing high profile people with diametrically different perspectives on firearms. A must see dvd that should be shown in classrooms. bob tanabe
3,Good Book with a Bad Title,"It's a decluttering book, not a book about ""from big to small"" house downsizing matters as you might think from the title and cover picture. It is a pretty good decluttering book but the deception turned me off a bit."
5,A ZEST FOR THE JOY OF LIFE,I RECENTLY RETURNED FROM A 10 DAY CARIBBEAN CRUISE. IT WAS MY FIRST CRUISE AND I ENJOYED EVERY SINGLE SECOND. IN TORTOLA WE WERE BY A BEAUTIFUL POOL WITH PALM TREES. THE BEAUTY WAS ASTOUNDING AND THEY PLAYED ALOT OF MEET ME AGAIN IN MARGARITAVILLE. WHEN I GOT HOME I BROUGHT THIS 2 CD SET AND I HAVE IT WORN OUT. THE MUSIC AND THE SLIDE SHOW OF PICTURES OF THE TRIP ON MY COMPUTER JUST BRINGS ME RIGHT BACK THERE AGAIN. I THINK JIMMY BUFFETT HAS A REAL ZEST FOR LIFE WHICH HE SHARES WITH US IN HIS MUSIC. BUY THIS CD. YOU WON'T REGRET IT.
4,Another Great Collection,"Same Great Songs, fun new versions. This is the collection that I have wanted to make for years. The live stuff is great as usual."
3,Lucky Parrotheads?,"This compilation does a pretty good job of gathering the highlights of Jimmy Buffett... and then some. As with all anthologies, you can argue about what songs should or shouldn't have been included, but nevertheless a well chosen and thorough collection. You get old songs, new songs, studio and live tracks and re-recordings. The nicest thing is the improved sound quality of these songs. I really hope Rhino puts together a Deep Purple anthology like this one. Two jam packed CD's from the ""classic"" Purple lineup. One greatest hits disc is NOT enough and the 4 disc set is way too expensive. This is a very reasonably priced and well put together collection!"
4,"Entertaining, Fun, British ""sort of"" Mystery","I'm a big fan of the Angel series by Mike Ripley. Are they really mysteries? HMMM - this one is, sort of. They are certainly entertaining and full of fun characters and situations. Definitely fit within the mystery genre and I think most mystery buffs - with the exception of the ones who are completely dedicated to intense psychological angst, character abuse, and torment (not that I'm totally opposed to these, just sometimes need a break!) - will have a fun time with Angel and his various associates, neighbors and hangers on. Ripley is a good writer, things move along well, the plot isn't always the strong point, but so much else is that one tends to let it roll. This is one of the earlier Angels, before he got married and lost a bit of his ""street cred"" and a touch of his insouciant take on life. I guess we all have to grow up - but I had hopes for Angel! However, in this one he is still Angel and a fun read when life is otherwise grey and grim."
2,Not Wynton's Finest Hour,"Wynton's Classical recordings are a mixed bag, and this is at the bottom. While his recording of the Tomasi and Jolivet concertos is one of the best trumpet solo recordings ever released, this collection of Baroque favorites finds Marsalis' usually beautiful tone now strident and too prominently featured. He's not a team player in the Brandenburg and spends the rest of the disc overblowing and overornamenting what should be beautiful Baroque repertoire. Check out the Tomasi/Jolivet or ""On the Twentieth Century,"" but leave this one on the shelf."
2,Does Not Work,This product does not work- I'll never buy a replacement filter for it. Once it needs one I'm throwing it away.
3,I think it's doing something?,"I bought this unit for the area where I keep my cats' litter pan. I ended up using it elsewhere because it's just not efficient enough to filter out all the litter odor before the fan propels the air outwards into the room.I use it in the main living area and it must be helping because when I change the filter, it is positively caked with dust. Ew.5/29/11 UPDATEI purchased the replacement filters specifically for pet odor and the difference is noticeable. They are much more effective at removing kitty smell from the air. I have moved the appliance back into the cat litter pan area and I am very happy now with its performance."
5,Great,"I ordered two of these air filters to handle my husband's cigarette smoking. I have allergies and the smoke burns my eyes. These filters have been great! I bought one for the bedroom and one for the living room. Our house is small, and they totally do the job. You can 'hear' the fans, but I find it to be a low 'white' noise. No more than a ceiling fan or a low standing fan. I did have one make a rattling noise, but it was because I did not have it snapped properly in place. Once I lined everything properly and securely, no extra noise.I have had them for a month and have not replaced the filters yet. They nightlight is nice, but I would like the option to turn it off. (Especially in the bedroom.) Otherwise, I have no complaints. I will buy replacement filters and continue to use this product."
2,Not sure.,Didn't help my contact dermititis rash...used the whole tube. I'm now trying applying raw honey and am seeing instant results. Raw honey has amazing skin healing properties. Must be RAW HONEY though.
5,ss strings,"used these for years on my SG they are great!i play many different kinds of music, everything from metallica to smoke on the water."
1,This book is a mess,"This book was published back in the 70s, before the advent of LaTeX. And it shows. In particular, it is no good as a reference for this reason: each time you try to look something up, the page is too overcrowded with symbols to find what you're looking for. In addition, to use this book to learn stochastic processes puts you through a whole lot more trouble than you'll probably need. Each deduction in the book is long, boring, and hard. Since I've read other books which are not, I'm going to assume it's the fault of the authors and their lack of LaTeX.This book, not unlike quite a few in probability and statistics (e.g. Billingsley), is popular because old professors used it and don't bother to find a new one."
5,An outstanding book!,"I found this book while learning about Raku, and was delighted to see it covers similar techniques. When my daughter-in-law acquired a kiln, I knew she would love to have this in addition. It also grabbed my son's full attention!"
5,If you ever wanted to get back into ceramics on a shoe string. . .This is the book,"I haven't done ceramics for decades because of the high cost of the equipment needed. I had a wheel given to me by a friend, but without a kiln I wasn't able to do a thing. This book goes into a number of traditional kiln alternatives that blew me away. Some use old 55 gallon drums others cover pit firing. There is also a great tutorial on Terra Sig. How to make it, burnish it and fire it. Also included are a number of high quality photos of the authors work as well as other contributors. I have read this book and perused it pages 10 times and still I learn something new and valuable with each reading. Well worth the money. Five Stars and a sixth if it were posible."
4,Alternative Kilns & Firing Techniques,Well written with explicit instructions and photos explaining each technique. Inspiring to try new techniques!
3,Okay.,"This movie was ok, it really should have been PG-13, other then that, it was alright. Kind of draging."
2,New In Town,"The movie was very slow, not funny at all... The movie lacked romance; no real story line. ""Sweet Home Alabama"" is everything that you think this movie would be centered around Minnesota, but there was no comparison. I thought it was going to at least be good, but I found it to be a great disappointment and a waste of money."
2,Boring.,"New in Town had all the potential to be a great romantic comedy but even good, talented actors couldn't save this stinker. I have always adored Renee Zellweger and yes... she gives another outstanding, funny performance but the pace of this film is very slow and the jokes fall flat from the supporting cast. Zellweger's chemistry with Harry Connick Jr. is excellent but overall, I found in New in Town to be very drab. I was hoping for so much more, a major disappointment."
5,Cute and funny movie!,"I love this movie. It is funny and romantic. It's got a great cast of Renee Zellwegger and Harry Connick, Jr. Touching too!"
1,Reggie Records - provider of product,"I did not received this product from Reggie Records and have attempted to communicate with them several times for a refund - to no avail. Please help me either receive the product or a refund. Thank you, Annie Mabry."
4,Very pleasant.,"Somewhat reflective of its time (mid-70s), but still generally true to the Peanuts spirit. There are two ""specials"" on this disc which I honestly do not remember ever seeing. They are not of the same caliber as other Peanuts specials, but they are still very pleasant and enjoyable."
4,"You're A Good Sport, Charlie Brown",This is a great lesser known video that teaches kids good sportsmanship while having a few laughs along the way. My daughter loves this one. I used to have the book.
1,BEWARE: HALF-LENGTH EDIT!,"This really is only half of ""Charlie Brown's All Stars"" from 1966. Who the heck thought of doing this, and why? Ridiculous."
5,"Tennis, motocross, and a minor victory for Charles!","Remember motocross, anyone? The sports-of-choice in this Peanuts outing hint at the fact that it's over a quarter century old, and make it a nostalgic throwback for 30-somethings like me. But the humor is timeless, and there are some classic scenes in this TV special: Snoopy doing battle with the tennis ball auto-serve machine; Snoopy riding that same machine in the motocross race; and Charlie Brown putt-putting to a slow victory on his decrepit motorbike, wearing an improvised pumpkin helmet. If you like Peanuts, you'll love this program."
3,Son's movie,Can't say that he has ever talked with me about it. Charlie Brown is a household fixture in our house so this was one to add to our collection.
1,Yuck!,Just got this crap today.Ordered this based on the good reviews so excited and tried it on.as soon as i put it on been sneezing badly and after few minutes got headache.And when hubby smells it he said that it makes him nauseous.SiGh!Oh well charged to experience.throw it in the trash right away.So i think this smell is not for me.but not everybody have same taste but i just want to say what i want to say.
3,bottle holder ok,This holder is ok but it holds only small bottles so check if your bottle's size first to see if it fits.Planet Bike Button Bicycle Waterbottle Cage
3,"Pretty fragile, but it works","This is a good, functional water bottle holder. It is lightweight and practical. But the decorative plastic pieces are pretty darn fragile. They broke within a couple of weeks on my bike, and I don't abuse my bike or go offroad. I must have hit or bumped it against something, but I can't imagine what. It wasn't a crash or anything, probably just while parked at a city bike rack. A bit of a disappointment, but it works."
5,Required Reading,This is required reading for those who are interested in self-enquiry and the actual practices that develop increased integrity and compassion. My mind-body group that meets every week has assigned it to be read by its members - we have found the fundamental teachings to be invaluable. Be sure to get the revised 1999 edition with the blue cover.
4,Great buy,- Simple reading- Well organized- Fast upgrading from 1.1- The only bad thing I've found is that is a too low programming level. But is a fast way if you want to upgrade your ASP.NET 1.X knowdeleges
5,"Butch, you gave me the best mixtape, no joke!","This CD is awesome, I advise you to go get it. All the songs are good...this CD is just plain good. Whether is be through humor or emotionally driven lyrics each song has its own part that just adds to the overall quality of the CD. It's kind of sad that Butch doesn't have all the publicity he deserves because if he did, he would be moving to the top! He has helped produce a few succesfull artists so hopefully they wont forget him.GET THIS CD ALREADY!!My personal favorites are Mixtape, that song is so cute and so sad at the same time. ""You say hello, inside I'm screaming out I love you"" So touching...So at last...this song is pretty sad as well but Butch manages to make even the sadest song sound beautiful.The last song on this CD is a hidden song and it is AMAZING, he ends it with ""thinking of you with my last breath"" Wow!So yes, I most deffinately recommend getting this CD!"
3,Haven't used yet,Haven't used yet. Just stocking up for future projects. Product was what I needed as a refill for my rotary.
5,One Day On Earth,"To me essays are strolls through a writer's perceptions of life and people. Bauer's writings are easy on the mind. Reading them is like walking through a beautiful garden fragrant with gorgeous blossoms, overreaching trees and sparkling fountains. At the same time some have a humorous twist that brings a chuckle or two. When I need a lift or a laugh, One Day On Earth, A Third Eye view is a favorite reference And, Bauer's third eye sees life through a clear lens. I love her style and commonsense views. ~ Jo Peddicord, Author and Syndicated Columnist"
5,You've Got to Get This,"I heard Dan Shaughnessy say on the radio that this book was better than any of his, so I got it and after spending a few days reading it, all I can say is WOW!!! It's now my favorite book ever. It's way way better than the Curse or of my other Sox books and I've got a full shelf. This book has everything they do plus alot more stuff I've never known. Great stories from the past to the present (well, last year), great writing and the best pictures I've ever seen of the Sox. I've been driving all my friends crazy the last few days talking about it. I don't think you can call yourself a Sox fan anymore if you don't have this book."
3,Lovecraft at his meh-est,"I believe that who ever chose this grouping of stories had very little apparition for Lovecraft's works. The selection seem haphazard, but i would like to note that there are a number of stories in this book which i have never heard of or read, so it wasn't the worst purchase."
4,A Very Pleasant Surprise...,"I am a huge fan of the Byrds and CSN(Y), but I always felt the Crosby was more of a weak link who happend to be in the right place at the right time TWICE. This solo effort is proof positive that before the ego got overblown and the drug intake out of hand, David Crosby was more than capable of writing and performing some really good music on his own. There is an etheral quality to this album that is hard to describe but is very pleasant and the all-star musicians who participated in this project made sure that the presentation was top-notch. The album is NOT ""overproduced"" at all and I am glad that I gave it a chance, I really like it!"
5,One of the great albums,"I've wore out two of these albums but just recently purchased the new CD. It is of course a pretty mellow album...but the musianship and the material are so well done that the songs just seem to be part of my DNA anymore. Cowboy Movie is the song that if I did Karaoke....and it was ever available and if I could actually sing...well.....that would be a cool song to do. If you like any of the Crosby, Stills Nash Young albums do your self a favor and get this one. Then roll a fatty...not that you'll really need to....and just let it play....it's timeless."
3,Temper of the times,"Those who bought this album when it came out were either unrepentant hippies or nostalgic for a time soon gone. CSN (Y) had huge hits and all went off to do whatever they thought would be their own ...gift. Steven Stills had a contract and got lucky with a minor hit, Graham Nash hung w/girls either he wrote about politics or they wrote about him (check Cananadian/American/LA canyons references), Neil Young continued to write explore and push the 70's to 80's and beyond.But this album, obscure for most, lies mostly in the temper of the times. A snapshot of early 70's whirlwind of Crosby's wandering. His vocals are pristine, his lyrics unknown. Muscianship is evocative and definately Nor. California. India beaded drapes, bong infused, and one-eyed opened in the morning.Brick bookcases and a turntable ...and the the best part is theache of Crosby ""I Swear somebody was here"""
3,Misrepresented,"As others have said, the music is 5 STARS!!!. But, read the description fine print that says, ""This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title."" This item contains one audio CD, nothing else. It is not remastered. It is the original release of the CD, hence it's low price.One would think that Amazon would correct this blatant error, especially after multiple comments about it."
4,Let the noble have their sport.,"Extracting materials from Badgers is an old and noble tradition here in England, dating back to the Middle Ages. Sadly, growing accusations of cruelty and barbarism from squeamish city-dwellers has put pressure on the practitioners of this ancient craft to provide a moral justification for their pursuits.Therefore it was a very happy coincidence that a by-product of the sport could in fact be used to sooth and sedate the very people that opposed it. Thus, Badger Balm was created! (and very good it is too)."
5,EXCELLENT..,"There is nothing like it ... I am an aesthetician.. and this puts my clients in dream land. I myself have used it, when I had a tooth taken out and could not sleep, and it was beyond wonderful.Romi"
3,Smells nice,"I love the scent of this product. It's a little lavender, a little herbal. Very nice. I can see how this scent could be relaxing at night time. However, I don't believe it helped me sleep better or help get me to sleep. The scent seems to fade fairly quickly and it seemed to be a pore-clogging waxy substance that you have to remember to wash off in the morning. I tried putting it on my lips, as recommended on the label, and woke up to find breakouts at my lips... I've never had THAT problem before!So, I think it makes a nice dry hand balm, but I wouldn't put it on my face or neck anymore. It smells nice, so that is a plus.Another note -- the product arrived in a packaging envelope, with no other packaging (the tin was not bubble wrapped or in a small box). So the tin arrived dented pretty badly on the lid, to the point where I had to get my husband to bend it to get it to stay on somewhat properly."
3,Broad but flimsy overview of biblical figures,"This is a coffee table book. Large size, large font and large (although not uniformly good) illustrations. The content is fairly broad, but not really detailed enough to serve as any kind of reference. Still, if you're not expecting a serious work, you won't be disappointed."
2,KC no longer has the quality they once had,"I bought these shoes for softball. I had only played about 4 games as we had issues getting the number of players together.However, in the short amount of time I had the shoes, the strips on the inside edging of the shoes had already come loose. One would expect this to happy after a full season of wear and tear, but not after 4 short games on fairly smooth grass play. Also, I would like to note the shoes are a nice fit, but can get quite hot inside.Overall, I am not a happy consumer... when combined with the fact another pair of KC shoes ($180) falling apart after 1 month (the sole LITERALLY peeled apart into two), I will never buy any Kenneth Cole apparel again."
4,Go FIU,The game is awesome. I love the fact that you can be any team on the board and try to win the Tourney. I like picking the underdogs and matching them up against the top ranked teams like North carolina and Duke.
2,So Called Key to Conspiracy,"I came across this title several times in other reading. I don't remember where I found references to this book but there was a lot of weight attributed to the importance of this title. First off, there are only like twenty pages, it is an incomplete work. The style by which it is written seems like the author wanted this work to resemble and also have a similar gravity as the bible. The theology the book is based on is askew. Getting back to the value in terms of a conspiracy, the land described by the work is a land of law, hospitality invention and Christianity. Reading this work only does not constitute or reveal any great scheme for the future of America. If anything, it is to late for this book's vision to be realized."
4,"Good work, dated translation","The work is worth reading as an early modern scientific utopia. The translation is rather dated, but the book is free, so I'm not complaining."
3,Crank yankers rating,"I think Crank yankers is absolutely hillarious. I give a lot of credit to the comics involved in the series. I think they are all talented. I do wish, however, that they would invent more episodes with the older guy, I think his name is Elmer. The best episodes are with him."
1,Yikes!,"I guess I should be grateful that I read the book that this film was (supposedly) based on before seeing the movie--otherwise I wouldn't have bothered to read a novel that stands as one of my favorite books of all time. The novel is by Anne Rivers Siddons, and the correct title is ""Heartbreak Hotel""--unfortunately, another movie was released in that same year under that title, so this one was changed. The only thing this film has in common with the novel is the time period and a few of the names of the main characters were used. Other than that, the author was robbed--not sure what the writers and director were trying to do here, but they failed miserably and I have rarely been more disappointed in a movie. Read the book--even after so many years, I still reread it periodically and find myself enthralled every time."
1,[poor] and pretentious,"This film is about a female student at Randolph University in Alabama in the early 60's who is a writer for the school newspaper. She gets caught up in the civil rights movement and gets into trouble for writing in the newspaper articles favorable to the civil rights movement. It could have been a decent movie, but I found the acting and the dialogue so superficial and uninvolving and unconvincing. A much, much better movie on this theme is The Long Walk Home and also The Ghosts of Mississippi."
3,Someday this will be a classic...,"Someday in the near future this film will be remade and become a classic gay comedy, however this time around there is just something missing. The cast includes, Quentin Crisp, Lea Delaria, Stephen Sorrentino, David Fenly, Emil Herrera, and Michelle Hutchison. The story is about a gay icon who's being held captive by the drag queen Maria Callous (who also happens to be the leader of the gay mafia.) This movie is definatly a movie which should be rented, however a professional remake of this movie would be hysterical. Just something about the whole look of the movie that doesn't make it as funny as it thinks it is."
1,Homo Heights,"Sketch after sketch after sketch, intended to be comical, but ending up just being tedious."
2,Uh...,"This book was...interesting. I didn't really think this was a great book, but it's an easy read. Take a day or less to read it. The book itself didn't really strike me as a good. I think this story is more for kids from kindergarten to around 3rd grade [at most]. I got bored with it quickly [I mean, I don't see why people would want to read about ther adventures of a stick with an nut head!]. This is just my opinion though."
4,Good entertainment for children,The product arrived on time and in good condition. My grandchildren enjoyed watching these stories just like their parents did when they were younger.
2,Pippi Longstocking,"I have children ranging in age from 10 to 26 years old. I remember that my older girls loved Pippi Longstocking when they were about 8 or 10 years old. They got the videos from our local library and spent hours laughing at Pippi's antics. Fond memories led me to find the Pippi Longstocking films for a younger daughter for a recent birthday. I am very disappointed in the videos I got. My older girls must have watched another version. These films are filmed in Finnish? and dubbed in English. The dubbing is poor. In fact, the acting is poor too. I gave this 2 stars only because my younger daughter has gotten some enjoyment from the videos while traveling when there was nothing else to do. I do not recommend this series. I am sorry that I bought it."
1,Pippi Longstocking,"The Pippi Longstocking Collection I purchased was quite a disappointment to us. I realize it is an older film, and assume it was transferred to a DVD, but the clarity of it is aweful. The voices and mouth movements do not match up at all. My family finds it very annoying to watch, so I feel like at the cost, it was really a waste of money."
4,Pleasently Surprised,"I mostly only listen to classic rock, when I heard this CD I really enjoyed it. The varity of music styles on one CD was quite pleasing to the ear."
5,Excellent,"There is so much good information, clear teaching in this book from an excellent Teacher. My only wish is that it would come with a cd of the practices."
4,The Original Resident Evil,"The Original Resident Evil brings back memories, which is why I bought it. It was more fun in those days though I guess. I forgot what the graphics were like; They were a little choppy. The video is downright cheesy, which is great. I get ideas for roleplaying from this game. All-around I'd say it was a good buy, and a good collectors item."
1,Resident evil directors cut,"This game was boring. It does not even compare to part 2. If I were to compare it to part 3, I might as well compare a Playstation game to a Atari game."
4,A fine book.,This book is a good reference for anyone who wants to know about the development of riemannian geometry. It covers many active topics in modern differential geometry for every graduated students who can choose some interested fields for the thesis.
4,ON!AIR!LIBRARY,"The Album Leaf is a snorefest. This album is all about the only On!Air!Library! material that I know of that's available besides their excellent debut and final self-titled LP. Buy this and On!Air!Library! and stop listening to The Album Leaf. Or don't, I don't care, but you're missing out on good stuff and probably contributing to early onset of Alzheimer's from under-stimulating your brain if you listen to too much of that garbage."
5,absolutely amazing,Very very nice. Experimental down tempo just the way I like it. I had the pleasure of seeing these guys play here in Orlando and they blew my mind. I want all of their music in my collection.Peace... :*)
2,Not like other Sesame Street videos.,"My 20 month old son loves Sesame Street and all the puppets, but this video shows too many live animal videos. It doesn't keep his interest like the other videos."
1,Great Songs/Troubling Images,"My toddler and I love the songs on this tape. But, I am troubled by some of the images. There are aardvarks in a small pen and chickens laying eggs on conveyer belt in some sort of factory farm. I realize that the tape is 15 years old, but other tapes of the same era have better images.So, we switched to Sing Yourself Silly and Kids Favorite Songs. My daughter likes them just as well, but with better images."
4,good way to learn,"this is not the best of sesame street but a exellent was to learn about the enviorment. Through songs and stories presented by the muppets this video teaches kids about the enviormen and even ways to conserve it. This is a exellent video if forever reason you want to teach kids about the enviorment but, if you are looking for the best of sesame street there are plenty of other videos that show the many other wonders and facets of sesame street"
5,Romine Rocks!,"John Romine's first book rivals Stephen King at his scariest! There is too much in this book to go into detail. The episodes in Anne Arundel County, Maryland will keep you turning the pages. Suffice it to say Romine has burst onto the literary scene with a spectacular thriller!"
5,Too bad.,this is one really great album i can't believe these guys never really made it big. This album is so great I love it. Definatly in my top 20 albums of all time (very close to top 10).
3,snore,"this CD may have interesting sound FX and whatnot but when it comes down to beat this CD lack kick. there isn't any real juice to the CD. all of the tracks seem dull and slow. its ok if you're into the mellow haunting stuff, but if you prefer music that can really jam then i suggest their Remix Dystemper over this one"
3,not for a pro videographer...,"This tripod is very heavy duty, but it doesn't mean it was made for a professional with a big heavy camera. The fluid head is made very cheaply and does not tilt very smoothly, which is crucial in professional videography. Consider SONY tripod better.Thanks,"
2,"Ridiculous plot, makes humans look like idiots","This show could have been great, but the plot and the way the characters act is just ridiculous.The captain and the crew act like immature, compulsive children with no manners or common sense. They unnecessarily blow up part of a monastery, when they could have just surrounded them from several sides and shot them. There were only 4 Andorians!Then Captain Archer betrays the Vulcans, their main alleys, by deliberately giving the Andorians top-secret Vulcan info. If T'pol was really logical, she would have killed all the Andorians as well as her human crewmates on the spot.It's like this show is a parody of human stereotypes from a Vulcan's point of view, it just makes all humans look like idiots... This show almost has me rooting for the bad guy.."
4,Enterprise 5 Year Mission,"The least they could do is give the ORIGINAL Enterprise a 5 YEAR mission, to set a precedent for Kirks era"
2,Why the aliens have to be so good-lookin?,"I got these DVD's cause I like to think I model my life on Captain Kirk, and Scott Baculauriate was so cool in ""Quantum Leap"" I though he'd make a good role model for a couple of my kids, and on DVD I could take it to all their mammas houses when I visit on alternate weekends.My problem is that that vulcan just shows too much skin. I mean, that one episode when they were supposedly covered in alien spores and start rubbing gel all over each other? Well, I'm not too up on interspecies love, I got put in the drunk-tank in Mobile for that once, so I think it's setting a bad example for the kids.I give it two stars because the the special effects are better than the first Star Trek, which don't make sence because this is supposed to take place BEFORE captain Kirk..."
5,At Last on Blu!,"If this series was on SciFi, like it should have been, it would have lasted at least seven seasons. Just imagine the interactions with the Andorians, Klingons and Romulans if they had continued this great show. Hopefully, one day we'll get a movie version."
4,Good,I enjoyed it a lot. Wish the show lasted longer than it course. Good story lines that explain a lot of the ST universe.
5,"Wonderful story, beautifully written","This is a book that you start and don't want to put down. If you lived during the late 60s and 70s, you will love being reminded of all of the events that occurred. If not, you will learn from them. This author is a wonderful writer and storyteller and I look forward to reading more of her books. Don't miss!!"
5,"Surprising, excellent debut","To the best of my knowledge, this is JT's first album. I have listened to about all of his recordings, and this is far and away my favorite. From the opening notes of Don't Talk Now you hear JT raw, personal, and very talented. The next song is the beautifully arranged Greensleeves followed by the thoughtful Something's Wrong. My personal favorite ""Knocking 'Round The Zoo"" follows, and you hear a side of JT that never again surfaces in later recordings. You will instantly recognize Something in the Way She Moves, and Carolina in My Mind. They both appeared in later recordings, but these are the origional (and I believe better)versions. Every song on this album is very listenable. This album is a must for any JT fan, and any rock or folk fan should give it a listen. It delivers!"
5,JT In The Raw,"The first ever James Taylor album I was privvy to was ""That's Why I'm Here"" from 1985. From there on, I set about collecting them all, even that God Awful Flying Machine Album. But when I came to this one, with it's incredible foldout cover, and that Big Juicy Granny Smith On The Label, I was enchanted. I put it on, wondering if this was indeed the same James Taylor. In my experience his voice hadn't changed a whole lot from ""Sweet Baby James to New Moon Shine"". And so I listened, and I recognized the voice, although it was such a raw, unrefined Taylor. I think that's where this album wins. It IS raw, and a running musical commentary on a life muddled with Drugs, and personal turmoil. The five stars this album recieved were earned with Sweat, musical toil, and the exorsizing of personal demons. Best Folk Debut. Ever."
5,The Master Mellows with Age,"Anyone who has ever listened to early Leonard Cohen and loved the intelligence and sensitivity of the lyrics, but had trouble with the gravely unsteady voice will need to purchase this album post haste. Leonard has come into his own here and sings with a passion that approaches joy. He first displayed this mellow singing style on The Future, his immediately prior release, but now all the darkness of The Future is gone and this is just pure, joyful, live music performed by the absolute master of song. Buy it just for the incredible live version of Bird On A Wire. Give it a few listens and you will learn to love every note of every song. A must for any serious music collection and also (by the way) a GREAT technical recording that will make any stereo system sound terrific."
2,Not At His Best,Leonard's voice is unusually raspy. There is way too much bass. It was recorded live and many of the words are difficult to understand.
5,It's On DVD Audio now!,"If you are an RT fan, and are interested in the new format ofDVD-Audio, seek and you shall be rewarded."
1,Why would they make a game like this?,It really bites. The story is junk. The graphics are junk. But the moves and controls are O.K. And the sfx are good.Go play some other game this one stinks.
1,A Novel of Boredom and [forced love],"Sure the book has some interesting parts to it, however, the book drags on and on and on... This is not in any sense an erotic novel, unless the two [forced love] scenes described in this book (in much more detail than the few romantic scenes) just happen to be up your alley. Really, don't purchase this book. There are so many really interesting novels out there. Try Laurell K. Hamilton. She has some very interesting novels with a heroine that can take care of herself. Also, try P. N. Elrod. Both of these writers have much better character development and style than was demonstrated in this novel."
5,A Sophisticated Gentleman,"I couldn't agree more with 'Peaches'. I met the Count in '79, and have 'walked' with him ever since. He has been with me through college, marriage, and several household moves. His adventures are a mirror of our society, for who, after all, are the real monsters in life? The vampire? The ghoul? Or are they 'humans' like Savanarola who burned thousands, or Hitler whose name alone should evoke horror? Is the horror the idea of a vampire, or the inexplicable fear of something/someone different than US? Do our own fears create the monster? These are questions Yarbro explores with each installment. I hope that she continues to evolve this sophisticated gentleman's story. For Saint Germain rises above all of us to show us what true nobility is all about.For those just discovering Saint Germain's world, welcome to the true world of the vampire. No bodice rippers here. This is historical fiction at its best, but then who is to say that Saint Germain is not walking amongst us?"
1,An unfortunate disappointment,"I have been a Neil Diamond fan for 15 years and discovered with this album that his voice is certainly not what it used to be. If you're looking for his greatest early tunes, make sure you get the originals. Save the live tunes for when you actually go to the performance. He will always be an awesome performer."
1,"""Live"" is Deadly","I was looking for a collection of Neil Diamond hits and thought I'd found the perfect thing. Wrong. Unfortunately, I bought the album at a local store and did not come to Amazon for a review. Neil Diamond was a great singer and we all age, but he basically yells all the lyrics, so that these live performances bear almost no resemblance to the original recordings I was expecting to hear. I could barely listen to it once, and am going to take it to Zia records for re-sale immediately. Please be warned. This is not the original Neil. I wasted $25. Please save yourselves."
3,"Return of fighters and rip offs of old ones, 3D excellence","The very first 3D Mortal Kombat offers great graphics, new 3D worlds, the return of several fighters, tournaments, 2 on 2 kombat and much more. Scorpion, Goro, Reptile and others return to the game with a few new fighters, however the bad part is that all of the new characters have similar powers as the old characters that were not in the game. Another bad part is that unlike the past few Mortal Kombat games is that this game is very quick to beat and it lacks challenge. To make up for it though, there are the most awesome fatalities of any game, such as Scorpion's very realistic fire, the spinal removal from Sub Zero with a total 3D effect and Liu Kang's throwing his opponent straight toward the camera. Each fighter now has weapons as well to add flavor to the fight."
4,Mixed Feelings,"I have mixed feelings of this game. I agree with my parents about the blood, violence, and all of that stuff they usually say to keep me from feeling good about having fun, but I enjoyed playing it. It has hardly any slowdown, exellent graphics, and a nice little practice mode for hours of endless carnage. It may take a while to master, but its a blast."
2,"Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus","The whole dvd had about 10 minutes from John Gray, I found it disappointing, most of the dvd, show couples and their issueswith a very brief follow up. Very little substance"
1,Only for Manara fans,"Manara is one of the most lauded graphic novel artists, but I have no clue why. His drawings are crude, and way too hard core porn for my tastes. I thought this book would have tasteful nudes. This book is only for Manara fans in my opinion."
4,"Great book, entertaining, interesting",This book is good. It has a lot of interesting facts about the worlds greatest authors books. Things you might have missed when reading. It's worth the money.
2,"Utterly uncritical, and duller than dishwater...","The problem with the book is that it's utterly uncritical of the entirety of Stephen King's work - it's simply a basic recounting of the novel's plot, followed up with a few bits of trivia and the author's ""What I Liked"" section.The problem is that the author of this book likes everything about Stephen King, even when he's talking about King's weaker material. You could write the words ""I love Stephen King and everything he's ever done!"" on an index card, then post it next to the Amazon search results for Stephen King and you'd have this book in a nutshell.Plus, he refers to the Gor novels as ""wildly popular"". Uh, no.-Darren MacLennan"

1,BIG LET DOWN,"Fastball had a good thing with their stuff like ""The Way"", I have no Idea what happened in this album. It is way to slow for all the song's messages. AWFUL."
3,Step Forward for Fastball,"""The Harsh Light Of Day"", Fastball's third release, is a highly inconsistent album which has some definite high points, such as ""This Is Not My Life"", ""Love Is Expensive & Free"", ""Vampires"" (the CD's best track), ""Morning Star"", and ""Time"". However, Fastball has trouble keeping the songs consistent. Poor efforts are shown on ""Goodbye"", ""Wind Me Up"", and ""Funny How It Fades Away"". Fastball is still able to produce enough bright spots on the CD for it to be considered a step in the right direction. Brian Setzer's guest appearance on ""Love Is Expensive & Free"" helps the song enormously, and the orchestral arrangements that are included throughout the CD add a new dimension to Fastball's music. ""The Harsh Light Of Day"" will not be as big as ""All The Pain Money Can Buy"" was, but it is the better CD of the two."
4,YO! READ THIS!,"This is a good CD with all of the tracks connected well and many very strong songs that stick with Fastball's lovable style. It isn't anything particularly spectacular though. No track is a classic, but all are strong enough."
5,"""These Guitars Don't Jangle...They bite!""","So said the promo sticker adhered to the vinyl version when this album first came out (1986). And it's true. This is some of the most ferocious guitar power-pop you'll ever hear as ""Behind the Wall of Sleep"" and ""Blood and Roses"" amply demonstrate. It's also one of the best albums of the 80s. This one's a gem from the perfect opening track, ""Strangers When We Meet"", to the inclusion of two bonus tracks at the end. Also true: the Smithereens were never quite able to come up with a worthy sequel to this, their masterpiece. Though you might be eyeing that ""Best of..."" CD to get all their hits, this is really the album of theirs to get - this is their best."
5,Excellent CD - Had to Buy it Twice,"I loved the movie and the soundtrack and bought both as soon as I could. I loaned the CD to someone at work and never got it back. Now in 2007 I found it was only available from used sellers (some say they have never opened copies) with the price being around $50 to as high as $100. I say this because it shows how popular the CD has become and how truly good it really is. I of course ordered it from a seller and got the CD, it is truly one of my favorites and highly recommended."
5,"Ambient, sublime, mysterious","I first got acquainted with this soundtrack while watching the movie. I loved both ""at first sight"". The music has an haunting ambient feeling to it, a feeling that the universe is indeed vast and mysterious and we are just cogs in its structure. In this way, it is perfect for the movie.The music is amazing in that it uses instruments normally associated with energetic rhythms (steel drum, gamelon) and transforms them into what sounds like signals from deep space echoing through the heavens. Strings are used to soothe, but also to create tension when dissonant notes are blended and unblended repeatedly in the high octaves.This music is good for laying back and closing your eyes and distancing yourself from the hectic world of daily life."
4,Fine music for a so-so film,"All right, I admit it: I didn't like the film much. It was okay. But the thing I remember most about it was the music. So, despite my lack of taste for the film, I purchased the soundtrack.I reminds you somewhat of the ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" soundtrack, but not so much as to be a theft.Soft, contemplative. The type of music you might want to hear at night. I've already lain on the floor just relaxing to it perhaps imagining myself in a spacecraft about to attach to a space station.Hmm...maybe the film wasn't that bad.No, I won't go that far. But if you're like me, the Martinez music, while you watch the film will sink into you. Definitely worth it having it around to listen to again and again."
5,what the heck is this???,ok first off I want to state I am a wrestling fan. and well this get does have most entriance music for everyone (where is Jericho's?) and the graphics are nice and the video is cool. With that said.. this game's controls are non exsitant. It takes forever to figure out a move (played a rented one no instuctions) and it's not a game anyone cna pick up. once I got the move off the net they were still hard to do. also the ring is way to small it should have been bigger with more room to run around in. The range of a punch and kick looks dumb and it plays way to slow. The moves are a real pain to pull off. The run Ins are cool the first few times but get annoying and dumb. Get WWF Warzone it is a better game easy to play (even if you just mash the punch button all day)the graphics and music on that one are great and it makes this look worse than it already is. I hope a GOOD WCW Playstation game will come out sometime.
3,Its ok,"I agree with the other review, dont pay more then $90 for this lens. its pretty good, but nothing to get excited for. its a nice starter lens or something to use for new photographer, the images are not very sharp, but they do have good color. focus speed it average and kind of noisy you can hear the gears a mile away. I think I will sell it and get a better lens."
1,Can't be any much worse than this,"This has got to be the worst DVD in my collection. Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Survivor fan. If you thought the first Survivor DVD was bad, don't even think of getting this second one. CBS did a very poor job of assembling this DVD. They did not even manage to get the main essence of the Outback contestants into this DVD. The DVD features are equally bad (just clips from the Early Show). I think the best part of the whole DVD was the magnificent shot of a magpie crapping (literally). That pretty much sums up this DVD. CBS should just release the entire series on DVD and stop all this ""Greatest and Most Outrageous Moments"" nonsense."
5,Excellent practical book,"I commend Dr. Yang on this well organized compilation that covers the techniques and theories of Chin Na. Excellent illustrations that clearly show the techniques when focusing on dividing the muscle/tendon, misplacing the bone, sealing the breath, blocking the artery or cavity press.Most of the book concentrates on the defensive chin na against barehand attacks, blocking, kicking knife attacks and grabbing. Since that is where your mind must be focused to react quickly, naturally and effectively.This seizing art form is explained in an easy-to-follow step-by-step manner. Highly recommended.Aloha ka kou, Kevin"
5,Awesome,Dr.Yang Jwing ming is the manmost everything is applicable you just have to train it until its a reaction.muscle memory
1,Great Mistake,The video does make a mistake in caying that Muhammad learnt religion from christians and jews. It does go into history of islam and the caliphates. A good intro to the topic. The prophet Mohamed Peace upon to him didn't learn from Jews and Christians; Jews and christians of his Time didn't say anything. This video is propaganda of Jews and christians.
1,If you want to learn Islam. do some where else,The video is a sole propaganda against Islam by the producton house which made it.They dont even admit that Muhammad ( Peace be upon Him ) was a prophet.Its totally baseless and useless effort. looks like a work of fiction then history.
2,Mediocre Effort,"Liberty has nothing new to say about this band. The only great songs are Serious, Liberty and My Antartica. Great drums and guitars in both songs. Others like First Impression and Violence Of Summer, are childish and very influenced by an overused New Wave/Synth Pop Style. Very bad production and a lack of creativity. Not recommended. Buy their later productions instead. Everything they've done after 1993 is awesome, but avoid this one."
3,Underrated gem,"Okay...so Duran Duran were falling out of favor around 1990. Sure, it would be another three years before they made a staggering comeback with ""The Wedding Album,"" but ""Liberty"" is a solid, and sadly overlooked, gem.True, the CD lacks focus, and it's obvious the band wasn't sure where to go stylistically at the time (this CD also introduced a couple of new band members), but there are some excellent tracks here....""Violence of Summer"" is odd but catchy as hell, and ""Serious"" is a straightforward pop ballad...one of the best songs the Duranies have ever done.The album as a whole, as previously mentioned, goes all over the place stylistically, and suffers a bit from Chris Kimsey's bloated production. But ""Liberty"" is far better than ""Seven and the Ragged Tiger,"" a horrible mess that remains one of their most popular albums. ""Liberty"" has a bad rep from critics and three people may have actually bought the thing, but it truly is worth the time and money."
4,Duran Duran Liberty,"Liberty has songs for everyone, some upbeat songs like All Along the Water, Violence of Summer, and Liberty; and beautiful slow songs like Serious, Venice Drowning and My Antartica. This album is a must for any die hard and new Duran Duran fans."
2,Dull and impossible,"This game was very poorly made...it's really boring, because all you do is walk around and throw stuff at things. All the enemies are exactly the same, there's never any health, and 100 health points aren't enough, because the health goes down too fast. The sight of range is ridiculous because half the screen is nothing but fog, and it all just draws in as you walk ahead, making it hard to see enemies. I do like seeing the familiar South Park characters in 3D, the game is very funny, and the weapons are hilarious! But still, I wouldn't buy it. Rent at most."
1,Only the Intro Scenes are Good,This game stinks even if you love south park. I rented it and watched the intros which were awesome. Some of the guns were really neat to use at first especially the plunger.The gameplay stinks this game has nothing but fog it is so hard finding your way because you can not see what is ahead. If you don't understand the techinical term of fogging then rent this game because it is the most used thing in the game even more then the fart noices.
2,Rent before buying,"First of all, SP for N64 is one of those games you play for about a week and then stash away. For me, it is too hard and lacks detail. The best thing about this would be multiplayer, which is only fun for about 30 minutes max. It deserves two stars for the bad language, which people my age group, and myself, would find attractive."
3,oceanborn,"Oceanborn's a little dark, but overall, I enjoy listening to Nightwish. ""Moondance"", ""The Riddler"", ""The Pharoah Sails to Orion"", and ""Stargazers"" would have to be my favorite songs from this album."
1,Ouch that hurts,I don't even own any of nightwish's CD's but i am glad i could review it and thankfully never have to say i actually own any of thier cd's. They may be good and all that i will never know just not my style.I recommended kidney thieves to a forum and Nightwish was a recommendation in return
4,SOULBLADE,LIKE THE GAME ALOTTEST YOUR SKILLS AND PATIENCELIKE TO PLAY SOME OF THE OLDER GAMES FROM TIME TO TIME
4,ACCOUNTING ENTRIES,I highly recommend this excellent product to record accounting transactions especially when a manual system is used in very small businesses.
4,LIFE IN THE SUBURBS OF GHOSTS,"For my money, a much better movie than the other recent underground comic book translation, ""American Splendor"". It's about two female high school graduates who bravely confront impending adulthood in the mundane suburbs of California and it is funny without being loud and cynical without being abrasive. Probably a more precise deptction of the teen scene than the current slice of silly cinematic pie, it's a rewarding, funny thoughful film for all concerned."
5,One of the best movies I have ever seen!,"Ghost World is that rarity-a movie which transcends the screen and keeps us fully involved the story. The script and the acting are both spectacular and the movie looks great too. This is an in depth character study of anyone who felt alienated in high school only to find herself more alianated after graduation--and that's most of us, right?You will be fascinated and you won't want the thing to end!"
5,Possibly one of the most amazing movies ever...,"Ghost World is one of my favourite movies ever. I absolutely love it. It's hilarious, has a great cast, powerful characters, and teenager dilemas. The movie is entitled ""Ghost World"", not only after a comic, but it means something. It pretty much means that everyone is progressively becoming the same person, and all that is left are the ghosts of the people that used to be. You can see how people get increasingly more similiar in the movie, and in real society as well. Plus, Thora Birch looks so much better with the extra 20 pounds she put on for the role."
2,"Blah, Overated","Okay, so Thora Birch is hot in this movie and Steve Buscemi is the man in anything he does. But this one just didn't do it for me. It had a few funny parts. I wanted to see more of the weird guy at the convenient store with the numchucks - though he kinda reminds me of Stifler from American Pie. I like the girls Daria attitudes and such, and their retarded graduation concert thing was a riot, but the movie in it's entirety just had nothing really going for it.Kick ass tune in the beginning though, nothing I've ever heard of before."
3,Overrated,"As some film reviewers have already pointed out, ""Ghost World"" has been far too overhyped and overrated. I've had my share of teenage angst and general hatred for the world around me, but Enid (Thora Birch) is so unhappy and disdainful of the world around her that it's hard to garner any sympathy for her character. She's mean spirited and believes everyone to be stupid and idiotic. I've no idea if the comic book character upon which the film was based is more sympathetic or well drawn, but Enid left me with a bad taste in my mouth. I do admit to seeing this film a couple of years ago, so my opinion may be different if I were to see it now. I'm not sure though--my overriding feel for the movie was annoyance with Enid's self pitying ways and hoping that she'd get a grip and simply deal with and make something of the world around her."
5,Aren't we all freaks?,"Enid isn't normal - she wouldn't want to be. Neither are her friends. Rebecca, Enid's best friend, isn't so sure of what she's looking for. Enid is strong. She decides to search for her dreams. Rebecca looks to find safety. Who will succeed?An excellent comic adaption with great actors!"
1,terrible,"this movie was so bad that my girlfriend revoked my renting privileges. we both usually like lesser known comedies but couldn't get into this one at all. the art class scenes were amusing, but that's about it. we kept waiting for more, and it just wasn't there."
2,Just rent it...,"I purchased this DVD after reading the advice of other reviewers, I shouldn't have. While I agree Ghost World is smart and intelligent, the slow pace and often below-average performances (except for Buscemi) take away from what could have been a good movie. I kept waiting for some sort of climax or even something to laugh at, but the movie abruptly ended before that could happen. The only thing that kept my attention was Steve Buscemi's wonderful performance as Seymour, the object of Enid's (Thora Birch) obsessive attention. Don't waste the money on buying this DVD, rent it first."
4,"Great movie, okay DVD","For my money, this was the best movie of 2001, a wonderfully written and acted movie that touches on everything from coming of age to the increasing blandness of mainstream culture.What keeps me from giving this DVD the full five stars is the so-so presentation. Where's the commentary from Terry Zwigoff and Dan Clowes? How about showing some of Clowes' original ""Ghost World"" comics stories? I'm glad they feature the full musical number from ""Gumnaam,"" but the behind-the-scenes documentary just doesn't have enough information.A movie this good deserves a more fully-packed DVD. But I've got no complaints about the movie itself, it's terrific."
1,stink -o- ramma,"OK, Scarlett Johansson is very sexy in this movie, and the 80's guy (complete with mullet hair) got a snicker out of me, but most of all this movie is missing a plot. The main characters drone on in their meaninless lives cursing a lot. After watching, you aren't uplifted in any way or even challenged to think about anything, you are just depressed. It is a very slow moving and maybe I just don't get the 'art' of it. I just think it was boring."
2,Poppies in the Cemetery,"This movie receives all kinds of analytical accolades about Poppy (main character) and her relentless optimism, but truth be told, i wanted to kill her in the first 10 minutes. It was unnaturally gloomy watching this movie, so i could not even finish it...there are much more uplifting stories out there. Credit for the reality in cinematography....characters not glamorized, background very realistic...in fact, it seemed much more like a documentary."
5,You Won't Need Therapy For Awhile,"Watch this movie and think to yourself, ""Who am I MOST like?"" Poppy, the main character, or Scott (the driving instrutor)? Which one can you identify with the most? Now...Which one do you NOT want to be like? Or to become?The main character if FULL OF JOY for living. What is the point of life if there is NO JOY??? Honestly, I keep reading these negative reviews and they're so superficial. Forgive me, but that's how I feel. Every scene and every character has a reason for being the way it is. Trust me on this one. Just open your minds. Please. And remember this...it's a M O V I E. Seriously. Some people need to lighten up and drop the BS. Mike Leigh wrote and directed one of his best films here, and all some people can say is, ""The main character is so annoying"". Wow. How sad. Once you have THAT in your head, the rest of the movie will not make any sense. Word."
3,Ray Anthony - good but not exceptional,"I expected more from this CD, maybe a sound like that of Harry James.But this CD is not bad. Brings many good tracks, good music, and will please those who like soft music (that's where I fit)."
2,Marilyn's Man,"I was so exited to get this NEW Documentary about Marilyn Monroe, I heard so many good reviews that I went for it! I'm not happy with the end product, I thought that it would have a more inside depth about her life before she became the movie star we all grew to admire,this documentary is about a man longing for the love he had and lost, sure there's a couple of clips and photographs I haven't seen before, every other clip and photo you'll see in this DVD you can find it in every other documentary out there!!!! like I mentioned this is just the melancholic, nostalgic desire of a man that never forgot his first wife, she just happend to be Marilyn Monroe."
5,castlevania 64 rocks,castlevania 64 is one of the greatest games in the world a true classic the best of the best buy this game if your a castlevania fan you wont be sorry
1,Terrible!,"This game is good for people who are obsessed with 3D, and never played a Castlevaina game in their life. If you want REAL fun, at least rent a Playstation or Playstation2 (it can play PS1 games), and try out Castlevanai: Symphony of the Night. It may not be 3D, but it's HUGE. There are tons and tons of weapons, armor, head gear, accesories, spells, etc. to try out, plus cool a** bosses to fight, and two different castles! That game is also challenging! But try this game for one reason, and one reason only. Because if yoyu don't you'll just become curious. After all, this is just my opinion."

2,"Not bad, but salty",400 mg of salt per serving! Snyder multigrain contains 160 mg of salt. They taste ok. I bought these for my kids because they are whole wheat and healthy but the salt content makes them an unhealthy snack.
4,Full of Wonders,Precious source of documentary on Laughter Yoga and Dr. and Mrs. Madan Kataria in India. All the rest faded in significance.
5,First-rate resource for the budding DIY audio enthusiast,"Slone covers a wide range of audio projects in this book: amplifiers, preamplifiers, filters, and protection circuits. The reader is assumed to understand basic electronics terminology, but everything else is explained point by point. An easy-to-read format supplies just enough theory for understanding the circuit, then goes right to the practical application. Slone even provides 1:1 scale artwork of numerous designs for those who want to etch their own circuit boards. For those wanting to go deeper into amplifier theory than what is presented here, this book is an execllent companion for Slone's in-depth treatment of the subject, theHigh-Power Audio Amplifier Construction Manual."
2,A fun game with a few problems,"Rent this game, because you can beat it in 2 days. Crash Bandicoot had good graphics for its time and even now they are decent, but the lack of good 3D graphics causes you to sacrifice numerous lives due to not being able to judge how far to move or jump. Some of the levels are repetitive, like the High Road and Road to Nowhere, which are two levels that are virtually the same thing. Also, Naughty Dog really goofed up when they set up the game so that you can only save your progress at Tawna Bonus Rounds. (Not that often do these special bonus rounds come along.) This causes you to have to go back and redo a level that you have already beaten when a Game Over comes along. If you are looking for a good action/adventure game, try Spyro 2 or Crash Warped. This game isn't what I expected it to be, but it is still fun to play and the graphics are decent."
2,disapointment,"this game is pretty bad first off all you can do is run strait the only good thing about is its pretty long the other bad thing is its to hard and it gets boring i wouldnt buy this game if you want a crash bandicoot game get either 2,3,4."
4,"Moisturizing, leaving your shoulders wet.","Yup, this is a major tribute. Allmost all of the songs sound enough like the originals, but still enough like the performers. I only have one complain: Why is there a gumpoppunkcombo such as Ugly Kid Joe in there. I'm sure Whitfield and the boys have dug Sabbath since when, but i just isn't the premier group to perform on a metaltribute. I'm sure there were pleanty of other groups willing to play here."
3,good intro to the other side of hendrix,Most of this stuff has been released before but it does show another side of Hendrix that he loved the blues and if he had lived longer that would have come out. Best cuts on this cd are It's too bad a loose jam type song and Midnight Lighting a simple demo he recorded in early 1970. He wa s a great guitar player and I wish some cuts from the cd Hendrix: The Blues was on this cd. I give it 3 stars...Mike Shults
4,"Hey Sister, Soul Sister, Go Sister","The first five tracks of this album do it for me... then slowly as LaBelle edges its way into the '70s that funky Hammond/Horn/Percussion driven Crescent City N'awleans funk (produced by Allen Tousainte) give way to the poppy '80s (with a brief reprise via ""Get You Somebody New"". By no means am I putting Patti down, but Labelle was a funk powerhouse... unlike other ""girl"" group at the time they weren't ""cute"" and ""pretty"" they were RAW and SEXY, and Grooves like Lady M. sizzled over the air waves (it was too late for many radio stations to pull it from the airwaves til they realized that the song was about. In addition to Lady M., Are You Lonely and What Can I Do For You (both message heavy tunes) are worth the purchase of the CD alone, especially if you can't hunt down the original albums !"
5,A must for Labelle fans,"if you do not own a labelle cd or have never heard of them, and you would like to, then this is the cd for you. The voices of these three women swoops and soars like eagles. Patti herself with the multi octave voice. As to correct the last reviewer, BKA KOWTOWN,the labell verson of you are my friend is the original written by patti labelle's husband armstead edwards. sylvester's record is the remake of the song"
3,"Seen the Entire Series, This Vol. is One of the Worst","Being a true YYH fan, I have seen all 112 episodes, and this volume is the 3rd worst of all 32. (Terrible Truths and Dark Tournament Begins are worse than this) There is emotion in this volume, which I like but... it's not very entertaining. But, you shouldn't make this stop you from buying a 5-Star anime. I am still recommending this volume, because or else it will be weird having only volumes 2-32! So... I think you should buy this product."
4,"Well, the series is great!","I'm really praying this American release lives up to it's greatness. YYH is a great anime. I have seen about 30eps fansubbed, and refuse to watch the Cartoon Network dubbed version. Though some might not quite get how the main character is dead from the start, it all works out. ^.^()For the boys there's plenty of fighting, cursing, and some cute girl characters. For the girls, there's Kurama. He's a nice, polite, foxy (literally ^.^) bishonen. Oh yeah, and he still kicks butt - he just does it with roses.Oh, and there's the one known as the ""Vegeta-wannabe"", Hiei. He's a fire demon with a big attitude problem.And behind all the fights and tournaments each character's heart breaking past is shown. It's a little like DBZ - but the fights aren't as long and are certainly much cooler. And the style is more pleasing to the girls fans use to, say, Sailor Moon or Card Captors."
4,The Right of Free Speech,"I had enormous trouble with my email so did not receive this --I read the book about 2 months ago and need to read it again. I liked the futuristic concept and much of it points to our situation in America today. IOW, the future is here! Lines are being drawn and sides taken. Some of it seemed naive,logistically speaking. I am glad it is no longer banned, we do still have a right to free speech! And that is a natural right, no dictator can remove it until he removes us!"
1,The worst book I've ever finished,"I'm not going to bother arguing the premise or the underlying politics of this book; I'll say only that ""Andrew MacDonald"" has done nothing to convince me he's writing about the same world as the one I live in. He may have something about the gun issue, but gives no reason to believe that the Jews would be behind gun control. (Of course, if you already believe the Jews are behind most of the evil in the world anyway, this is not a problem.) I read this book because of its alleged influence, but found it so uncovincing that I can only conclude that the people who take its message seriously are on ""MacDonald's"" side from the beginning."
3,The worst book I couldn't put down,"In order to review this book I think you have to separate the author's obvious racism from the merits of the book itself. Let me make it clear that I think racism is just another tool that the powers that be keep us occupied with. But as much as I disagreed with that central part of this book I just couldn't stop reading. And understand that there are parts of this book that will literally make you wince.....think about that, words on a page that will literally make you wince. I can't say that about any other book I've ever read, and maybe that's why I couldn't put it down. But unless you want to subsidize this kind of racism I wouldn't buy this book. Try to get it second hand, I got mine from my father, he bailed out after 50 pages because it was so, quote ""raw"". I'd agree with that, raw and bloody and disturbing."
4,Not your average read,"I honestly enjoyed this book, mostly because it was so incredibly shocking. The majority of the time I was reading it my mouth was gaping open in horror. I couldn't put it down half the time because I wanted to see what was gonna happen next. However, I'll definitely say it's not for everyone. Especially prospective terrorists. Or racists."
3,not full,"the book is just great. i wanted to say kindle edition is actually not full. like second chapter is not there its just a short little review what happened in it and that all. i dont want to whine cause price is not big for his book, its just i really wanted to have this book in my kindle and i feel sad that its not full *(ps. if u look on original book it has 224 pages. kindle has 216"
3,ignorant in its rhetoric / dangerous in its message,"This book should be read by intelligent people and kept far from the ignorant and hateful. Although the rhetoric within is extremely shallow, simple and sometimes laughable, the message the author attempts to communicate to his kind is a fearful prospect to the civilized people of this nation."
2,Asinine.,"I first heard about this book when reading about right wing anti-government groups (Timothy McVeigh was a big fan of this novel). I figured I ought to at least give the book a try. The book itself is terrible. It is relatively short in length (about 200 pages or so) but is extremely boring. The plot of the book itself tells of a revolutionary group fighting the corrupt, authoritarian power that the United States becomes with breaks from the action for the main character to rant about blacks and Jews. The story plays on almost every stereotype about Jews and blacks and all anti-government hysteria put forth by neo-nazi type organizations.All in all, the novel's only good use is that of a conversation piece."
1,Be Aware,"Read this book years ago as part of a graduate class, Yale University.I benefitted because I was aware of the book and it's content...helpful should I hear about it in the future.NOW...2007...there have been a series of groups and individuals who have used this novel as a bible for how to do something harmful to others...several in prison for their actions.The DaVinci Code...the Turner Diaries...Think About It!"
4,Awakening,"The story is very relevant to American society today. I can understand ""How it happened"" . America either changes .. or it will happen here ! Beware of obama.... he wants to destroy America."
1,This book deserves no credence.,"I found this book to be gruelling to read. It's simplistic style makes it boring. It's content is absolutely ludicrous to anyone with an ounce of intelligence. Frankly, what scres me is that some people may take it seriously."
3,It lives up to its name,If you know anything about this book you will know it is fiction and and super extreme. The book is not for the weak minded; if you do not already have a strong opinion on the subject you can get lost. The book has an infamous past of inspiring American White Supremes (Neo-Nazis) to become more extreme and commit acts of terror. Read with Caution!
5,Mind-blowing stuff! Get it NOW!!,"I bought this book after hearing about it in the Press; I was expecting to be able to read it once and then laugh it off as some kind of sick joke. Boy, was I wrong! While I don't go along with everything that MacDonald writes, I have to say that most of it is sheer argument-defying truth and logic. This book is an ""Underground Classic"" - the term is often used in connection with some pretty worthless stuff, but this tome is beyond doubt a true ""Underground Classic""! I am a pretty cynical sort-of-a-guy and I really thought that I had seen it all in my time - but this book opened my eyes. A gripping, well-written, highly-readable, sometimes infuriating book - an ""Underground Classic,"" aboveground at last. PS: All I want to do now is ""see the film"" and ""buy the t-shirt""!"
2,Don't buy this - these are re-recordings - buy the originals,"Don't buy the Capitol Andrews Sisters CD's - these are re-recordings done in the 50's. They tried to copy each song exactly but you just can't recapture the original spirit of the times in which they were recorded, the sister's involvement in those times caught in every note, the spontenaity, and the jazzy bands over 10 years later. The originals are about 50 times better. I recommend The Andrews Sisters - Their All-Time Greatest Hits (MCA) - this is a far superior CD - all the original recordings from the 40's with neat DECCA replica label on the CD's and great liner booklet."
3,a fairly decent book,"An interesting book in its own right. The pictures are not bad ( but not that great either). For me, the hightlights of the book are some of the paintings showing people ascending M. Blanc during what seems to be a time period of a century or two ago. ( I wouldn't mind owning a couple of these paintings! ) The text about the history of the discovery of M. Blanc is rather fun to read. However, I thought the book was just a bit overpriced."
4,Good but not Great,"This had the misfortune to be made in the 80s. Charlie Brown specials weren't their best at this time. The music was post-Guaraldi and pre-David Benoit. For some reason, the voices and animation weren't good, either. However, it isn't the worst Peanuts special. (That award goes to ""Someday You'll Find Her, Charlie Brown"")If this were made in the 70s, it would be great. The New Year plotline involves Charlie Brown's homework dilemmas and New Year Dances.If you want a good Charlie Brown storyline, this is fine. If you want good music and voices, no. I think I only watch this because it's a New Year special."
3,disappointed,"This peanuts video had some cute lines, the animation & music were fair but the voices were ""BADDDDDD"" which made this ""below fair"" video to watch. Maybe if they tried to use voices closer to the original peanuts the video could have been a lot more enjoyable.My advice is to rent & watch before you buy this one."
3,Not one of the better films...but it IS the Duke!,"Well, I'm a big John Wayne fan. He was and remains one of the great American icons. Brannigan is not a great film, although one of his final films; it is a necessary addition to complete one's collection. But don't blame the Duke: the writing is bad, the direction is poor, the editing is mediocre and the story is a bore. Yes, the Duke is very old, but he is still great. It's just a poor movie. 'McQ' is far better all around. Look at 'Brannigan' as a film trip to Joly Ol' England with John Wayne."
3,Putting the UK in Duke,"Wayne's second try at following Clint's lead from the sagebrush to a modern urban setting is basically a retread of Coogan's Bluff and it's not bad. There are still some right-wing complaints about civil liberties, but the tone is more amiable than McQ. Everything's pretty diverting until we get to the drawn-out ""funny"" bare-knuckle brawl that doesn't work here any better than it did a few years earlier in The Undefeated."
5,"Insightful, hilarious","I saw this movie while doing a gender-issues project in school. Needless to say, I loved it! The movie looks into both genders and really analyzes them, but the movie finds a light way to do this. I adore the main character (Jonathon Tucker, I think); he brings a very human aspect to the screen, and I found myself hoping against hope that he would find his ""soul mate."" I reccomend this movie for anyone, male or female!"
4,It's not JUST porn...,"I picked this movie up while waiting in line at the video store and ended up renting it (in addition to SLC Punk.) When it first came on my friends laughed at me for picking up something that appeared to simply be a cheap excuse for gratuitous nudity. I was greeted with shouts of ""PORN!"" However, as the story developed we were struck by moments of pure honesty about the differences, confusions, and invisible lines between the sexes. It seemed to hit a balance between simple fun and simple truth such that we were never bored. By the end of the movie we were ready to rate it, if not quite as high as SLC Punk, a damn good movie."
1,Not as good as their early work,"I got into the Cocteaus through 'Garlands' and 'Lullabies', which are truly great albums reminiscent of early post-punk bands, but having so much more haunting power. I picked up their later work, and god! It's awful. It's like New Age music in New Wave packaging. It loses so much of the raw, jittery beauty that 'Garlands' had. It's a completely different band, and not one I want anything to do with. If you're into calm armchair music, I guess you'll like this, but for people looking for something exciting, skip this."
1,Motors Burn Out After Just a Few Uses,"I now have had three of these blenders and with each one, the blender motor burns out after just a few uses - so I say three is three too many! This product promotes a 500-550 watt motor strong enough for crushing ice, but don't count on it. If your looking for lightweight use only it may be OK otherwise, don't waste your money."
2,"Ok blender, bad parts","This blender doesn't do a great job crushing ice, but the biggest problem is that the black plastic base cracks easily. I have seen other reports of this problem. Rather than buying the replacement base multiple times I suggest investing in a better blender."
2,Buy this blender if you like to replace parts.,"I have owned this blender for 4 years. In the first few months I had to replace the blade assembly because it broke into pieces while I was making a smoothie. When I called, I was imformed that the blade assembly was recalled, so I got a new blade assembly for free. I had to replace the new blade assembly 2 times since. Just recently I was blending up some cooked beans into a paste and the glass jar broke at the bottom. I just now ordered a new jar, but I ordered the stainless steel one. I hope this one won't break. I had no idea that the blender jar could actually break like that. I thought I would have to drop it on cement for it to break.I really don't use this blender a whole lot, never really did. It really isn't a durable blender. When the motor blows on this one, I will not buy another Black and Decker blender again."
1,SAFETY ISSUES,"Bought this cool looking unit at Lowes. worked great for 6 months - i make 3 protein shakes a week on average. then at 3am one night we are awakened by a loud noise in the kitchen - our blender running on high! i pressed all the buttons to make it stop but it would not, so i unplugged it. used it the next day and it was fine. later that day it turned itself on again though. rather than dig up the paper work on it, pack it up and sent it back i just tossed it, went to Lowes and bought another. 10 months later - same issue with the second blender. looked up B&D online, found out they sold that appliance unit to another firm, called them and explained. to my surprise they said send us the cord and we'll send a new blender. wow. so either they really back their products or i'm not the only one with this issue. anyway, if you buy one i would suggest NEVER putting your hands in it when it is plugged in."
1,Died within 6 months,"I bought this blender and the motor died within 6 months--I only used it for an occasional smoothie. Even when it did work, it would leave chunks and sounded as loud as a jet engine. Would not recommend purchasing this model."
1,Lousy blender,"This is indeed a lousy blender. I totally agree with the poster above.#1. It is vital that you keep the top on at all times because anytime you turn it on, it errupts out of the container and will spray the contents all over the kitchen. Even at the lowest speed.#2. Keeping the top on shouldn't be such a big deal, except that the way they've engineered this thing, the top is too big, and it is very hard to get the top on.#3. It doesn't crush ice. I make smoothies about five times a week and my ice comes out somewhere between a jaw breaker and a marble. It take the edges off the cube, but does not totally crush it. In fact, it doesn't even a do that good of a job on other solid objects (bananas, frozen strawberries.)I tried to make do, but after three weeks decided to take it back. I got a Hamilton Beach blender that is priced exactly the same, and it's doing a much better job."
2,"Weak engine, glass cracked","I have the same issue like most people here. Engine too weak for smoothies, gets stuck and overheats. Although the jar is made out of pretty thick glass it is not heat resistant. Mine cracked when trying to mix veggies for a soup. I don't know if it is suppose to withstand heat but even thin-glassed french press hold boiling water... And the replacement costs another $22,- plus shipping, not worth it. I really like the color but cannot recommend the machine."
4,Works fine!,"I have had this blender for almost three years and use it to make smoothies often. I've never had any of the problems mentioned with it stopping after several uses, or with thick smoothies. I am missing a part (gasket) which makes it a little leaky, but it still works fine. I love that it can go in the dishwasher and, really, it is one of the sleekest blenders out there!"
1,Blender is POSSESSED!,"After about 6 months of owning this is started turning on by itself!I normally unplug this after using, but on a few occasions I have forgotten and it never fails..It turns itself on to the highest setting and scares the h*** out of anyone near by.I can only imagine what would happen if there was no one home. Would the motor eventually burn itself out or would it heat up and start a fire?This is something I really don't want to find out!"
1,"nice at first, good eye appeal, piece of junk though & customer service was no good.","1st one was for wedding gift. accidently broke the jar, so I bought a second. 1.5 yrs later the ring piece that holds the blade in breaks. Low & behold I am now only 3 months past warranty. black & decker wouldn't work with me, would only offer to sell me the little rim piece that holds the blade in for almost as much as the blender originally cost me. nothing more. very disappointed with service and will not be coming back."
2,Saw was defective.,Saw was defective. Blade did not square up at 90 degrees. Tilted at 45 degrees it would have hit the side channel. Hitachi warranty service in Peoria says they can fix it or it will be replaced.
4,"GOOD, Wish they went more into a Title Page, but Fascinating","I LOVED THIS BOOK. It would make a great collection on any Witches Shelf. Comprised of all different Celtic Myths, it is a fascinating book,and I reccomend it 100%~! Blessed be, Travis"
4,Good but his others are better,This is a hot album KRS has busted out and dropped another dope album but I have got to say his others where much better.This album just has a different sound then the rest and any hardcore KRS fan will know what I'm talking.But even if someone has never listend to KRS before listen to this but you got to hear the rest to know what the teacher really speaks.
2,Definitely not their best,I loved Souvlaki so I figured I'd love this cd. Wrong. Ouch. Don't waste your time or money. If you are new to Slowdive Souvlaki is a great cd with a wealth of creativity and sonic pleasures and it is well worth having. This cd is not.(...)
3,Sent me the kind for soil,Sent me the soil formula. I didn't send it back because I needed soil formula as well. I got nute burn. Had to adjust the amount I use. Soil formula is extra strong.Thank you for reading my review.
2,not good suspension,seems like a lot of the stuff is to course and settles out fast and winds up in bottom of water pail and not on your plants will not buy it again
1,These product is weak and is only for newbies,These products are complete trash IMO. I love fox farm soils I think they work great. However there fertilizer line could use a lot of work. First let me start by saying they are way underpowered in todays market. Clearly people need to learn how to feed plants rather then burn them isnt rocket science. Second this product will lower ph levels and cause acid build up. If feeding an fruit vines your going to need to transplant to new soil ever month maybe 2 if use these 3-4 times a week. I really think they could do a lot better with their product. The biggest reason i see is they are trying to stay some what natural in formula which is good but when it costs quality then im against it.
1,"Bad, bad, bad.","This is really awful. I'm a Meg Tilly fan, but her accent was appalling, and the male lead was such a repulsive stooge that the love scenes were about as appealing as something on the Discovery Channel involving large animals. Bad plot. Bad acting. Bad movie."
5,Medievil,"This game is my favorite! It is colorful, humorous, challenging enough to keep you interested and addicted, but not impossible. As Sir Dan, you earn some great weapons throughout the game. Each level is unique and has secrets that will keep you coming back for more. Everyone I know who has played this game says it's their favorite! I cannot wait to buy the sequel!"
5,The Hall of Heros Awaits...,Never are you gonna get a better game! I have never seen a game where you can fight zombies with swords and clubs. You can set your enemeies on fire with a Fire Crossbow. You'll fight the evil Zarok in Zarok's Lair. You'll go into battles with demons of stained glass. You'll go into Graveyards and use your sword to kill Zarok's Army. Collect the Chalice of Souls and go to the Hall of Heros for a reward. Once you have completed the game and you have collect all the Chalices you'll become a hero of THE Hall!Pros:Good GraphicsCool GameplayPretty Good StorylineVery Cool MenuCons:Not as thrilling as in MediEvil 2No blood like in MediEvil 2
5,Product is great; size was wrong,"Since Amazon's price point on these shoes is usually very good, I wanted to shop Amazon for this product that I have used for several years. However, the size wasn't right so I returned them.The product itself is excellent with built-in steel springs which makes for a lighter step, and the shoes are well built."
1,Pretty to look at - awful to control,"Though the game is very appealing in regards to its visual style, the controls are abyssmal. In level 1-3 at the end of the level, you are required to perform a ""whack-a-mole"" type game in order to get the last gobbo. Since the controls (or uncontrols) are glitchy at best and unplayable at worst, the game begins to not be a game and more of a nuisance. The analog versus digital controls have no bearing to eachother and you find yourself toggling back and forth just so you can have some margin of control. A game to avoid by any standard."
2,Hamburger Hill [Blu-ray] [Region B],"The quality was grainy, like sitting in the front row at a theater.Disappointed that it may never be a true bluray."
4,One of the best,"This movie is a highly accurate portrayal of life in Nam with the 101st. Good stuff. Some may criticize the lack of plot, but the battle for Hamburger Hill to the grunt didn't have one. It was just a struggle up a muddy, bloody hill that meant nothing."
5,Preachy Vietnam-War classic,"EXTREMELY violent vietnam war film about soldiers climbing up the dreaded Hamburger Hill. So named becuase it chews up soldiers like chopped meat. Coarse Language is all too frequent here, though. If you like this, also see ""Pork Chop Hill"""
3,the original voices of the smurfs are best forgotten!,Although it was the 1st movie the voices on the new newer episodes are far better. Papa smurf is my all time favorite and that voice has got to go!
5,Real life Vietnam.,"My brother, an Army MSgt, was in Vietnam twice and he recommended this movie. He said this was the true nature of Vietnam. I found it a riveting movie. The acting was stupendous as I believed these soldiers were real. Recommend as a history lesson for the younger generation."
3,I could gave done a better plot,"It was an ok movie, but I could have done better. I'm not from Holywood (I wish I was though) but I have creative Ideas and I could probably do a remake or something, but overall it was OK. The movie isn't a good one nor is it anything special either. If this film had a rating meter up to ten I would say this movie would be a 6.1. The reason, it has good graphics, good characters and filled with good landscapes, but has a wierd plot I'd have to say. This is a movie I kind of enjoyed but, not as much as the second film, buy this if you'd like and, I'm not saying you shouldn't see or buy this, I'm just saying I could have done a movie with the same title, same characters, same landscapes but, a different story plot."
5,great intro,"grreat recording. was one of the first cds i bought years ago. introduced me to nancy wilson, june christy and ella mae morse great singers each one ..also garland kay starr way too many to mention all great. check out capitol sings series as well. great musid for any time."
2,eh,"This would probably work better as a non-fiction. Alot of the stuff is pointless. THe dialogue is good, but that's pretty much it. It's too confusing and there's too much build up for not enough pay off."
5,Such a Cute Show!,"My son recently discovered this show on TV, and he loves it so much that I bought the first two volumes on DVD so he could watch it on the car DVD player. This show never gets old to him! He loves it. And it's actually one of the few cartoons that I can stand to watch! Funny, great graphics, and very cute!!"
5,Best instant noodle,"These are the best instant noodles I've tried. They're a little sweet and a little spicy, but they're not overpoweringly salty. I can see as someone might want to add salt, actually.Great with a fried egg as seen on the package. Don't overcook the noodles."
3,The Little Princesses: The Story of the Queen's Childhood by her Nanny Crawfie,"Not very interesting unless you are a Royal Family devotee. If all can be believed, the lives of the princesses and British Royal Family is so stilted, it is amazing that they can even lead a semblance of a normal life."
5,"Beautiful, affordable, light","Smooth and very well built. Proud to own it. Light enough to move around easily. Wish they would include the right side fence with the package, added cost is worth it."
4,Should come with options,"I've been using this saw for six months now and can find no fault with it at all. When it arrived the only adjustment I had to make was the laser. The detent's are on the mark every time, and I would think with a little TLC will last forever. The miters are perfect nearly 100%, when I use the material clamp, the occasional slip when cutting through a knot does happen when the clamp isn't in use.The only real gripe I have with this saw is that it should come with extension wings and stops! They are very hard to find and expensive when you do. I just made my own, problem solved! I did buy the right side fence-""should be standard equipment"".Over all a great saw."
5,"The best 10"" dual sliding laser on the market!","Simply put; the laser line makes all the difference in terms of fast and accurate cuts.This is a smooth operating, heavy duty, quality built dual sliding compound mitre saw which no offshore knock off can replicate."
2,Made in china,"I was very disappointed to find that this saw was made in china. This particular model sold elsewhere is still made in Japan and the finishing is night and day difference on the saws. Further the saw arrived damaged which was not surprising owing to the poor packaging. To amazons credit, they quickly refunded my money and the shipping cost, but it looks as though I may still be stuck paying the insurance needed to return it. I would be delighted if amazon was in the routine of describing where their products are made in the specifications section for each item. Surely, this is not the only example of this problem, and I know fir a fact that there are many people who, as a rule, endeavor to purchase items made in countries other than china."
4,A Keeper,I have been doing renovations for quite some time. After going through several name brand miter saws I thought I'd give the C10FSH a try. Right out of the box the saw performed well. the Laser works great for both angle and straight cutting. I did notice if your cutting right of center you had better add the thickess of the blade to the line. Left of center the line is right on. I dumped the blade that came on it and installed the 72 tooth blade before I even pluged the saw in. The saw works great on Crown. The duel bevel is a great feature. Now all I have to do is keep everyone that sees it from trying it out.
3,"Ok, But being a Spyro fan, the other 2 I played were better.","Lets just say, the other 2 are better (jmo). I borrowed this game from a friend and it was okay. The first warp room was good but once you got farther through the game I didn't like it. I know alot of people liked it but in my eyes Year of the Dragon was much better."
5,Great DVD!,Very interesting documentary with plenty of music and the insight of those who were there when the folk music craze happened.
4,Second to its predecessor.,"This is a worthy sequel to the classic horror game Resident Evil. With improved gameplay mechanics,an improved graphics engine,a plethora of locales to explore(as oposed to RE1's single location), and most of all the A&B scenario that depicts the games events from both characters perspectives. Put all this together and that makes RE2 technically superior to it's predecessor.This game has it all but it is more action oriented than the first RE which also makes it less scary. Sorry RE2 you'll always be second to your big brother.Anyone wanna pick it up and prove me wrong?It'll be worth every penny!"
5,A cool and scary game,Resident Evil 2 is cool and MUCH scarier than #1 there is much cooler weapons like the machine gun and gatlin gun and you can go outside not stay inside most of the time like on #1 i would recomend this game to others.
4,maybe the best adult/older teen game for the playstation,"It takes some time to get used to the coltrols but once you do you are treated to hours of gaming enjoyment. The story will engulf you, the suspence will startle you and when you finish the first disc you get to play again on disc two with just enough changes to keep the game intresting. You may actually enjoy the second disc more than the first because you will be used to the environment. If you are not an experienced gamer it would be a good idea to pick up a game guide to help you out along the way. Overall Resident Evil 2 may be the best adult/older teen game for playstation."
4,THE BEST PLAYSTATION GAME EVER.,"COMING FROM ENGLAND WE USUALLY RECEIVE OUR PLAYSTATION GAMES A GOOD FOUR MONTHS AFTER OUR AMERICAN FRIENDS GET THEIRS.WHEN I PLAYED THE FIRST ONE IN 1996 IT GOT ME HOOKED FOR MORE.TO ME THE FIRST RESIDENT EVIL WAS THE LAUNCH GAME FOR THE PLAYSTATION.WHEN RE2 WAS GIVEN AN AUGUST 1998 RELEASE DATE HERE I OPTED FOR AN IMPORT VERSION FROM THE STATES.IT COST ME $150 BUT BOY WAS IT WORTH IT.IF THE FIRST GAME WAS INCREDIBLE THEN THE ONLY WORD THAT COULD DESCRIBE THE SECOND WAS EXTRAORDINARY.BEAUTIFUL GRAPHICS,BRILLIANT GAMEPLAY AND SUPERB TEXTURE.FOR ALL THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO OWN A PLAYSTATION THIS IS A MUST HAVE GAME."
1,NOT REALLY ERGONOMIC!,"GOOD:- Fast shipping- Easy to assembleBAD:Based on my experience,-Aggravates my right leg pain-Not really comfortable to sit on as I expected (It's suppose to be good for your posture)-Something wrong with the distance of the knee pad and chair pad-The adjustable bar does not really work-Need more padding-The kneeling pad keeps wobbling-I don't understand why this chair cost too much ($144)?"
5,"Precious rose buds for sachets, teas and decor","These rose buds from Catey13 are precious. They have a soft aroma and a pretty look to them. I plan to use them for small sachets in the bags I bought from catey13, and use rose-colored ribbon to adorn the bags. I'm so glad this seller. I bought several things from her and she gave me a refund on the combined shipping costs."
5,Grammy winners churn out another classic!,"I must admit at first I wasn't a believer, but upon purchasing this album I must say I have never been this impressed. Grammy winners The Baha Men are one of the greatest bands of the last century, particularly thanks to their touching power-ballad ""Who Let the Dogs Out?"" Not only does it have infectuous dance beats and moving melodies, but it also asks a serious life's question: who DID let the dogs out? When I was nine I got chased by a huge dog that was almost as tall as me and since that day I have been wondering this question. I have not actually listened to any of the other songs on this album but since they won a Grammy I take it they are all good too.Anyways, I'm going to go and roll around in the mud with an inflatable pig. Buy this album. I guarantee you will be satisfied. Hoo."
3,Buyer beware!,These are all re-recording. For anyone that has not heard the originals this is probably a good album. I personally like the originals.
4,crash bandicoot is back.,"after falling from ballon cortex will crash into a dark cave which cantains power now crash is heading into five warp rooms and new bosses like tiny,komodo bros and n.gin. now crash can even fly in the jet pack."
4,A Great Game!,"The first time I played this game I was hooked!. You start out in the warp room and progress through each of the levels in the warp room. Also the warp rooms are themed such as space,jungle,railroad, and more. Plus there are bosses,most of them from the first game. The only thing I didnt like was that the end where you have to fight Cortex, that was the easiest battle I ever did, all the other bosses were harder then that. over all I say Crash Bandicoot 2:The Wrath Of Cortex is a must buy for new to old gamers!"
5,Crash still has it !A 12-YEAR OLD GAMER,"This is one of the best games I've ever Played. The only thing I don't like is how hard to get the colored gems are. I'll tell you where 4 of them are; for the blue, complete level 1 without breaking any boxes; for yellow, complete level 11 in the amount of time it gives you after you get the first checkpoint( between 50&70sec.);for purple, go to level 19. Go till you see the stairs with nitros on them. The nitros are fake, so jump to the top and you'll go to a secret part where the gem is. In level 10 go to where all the nitros are(andthe life is there). Go through the fake wall in the back to get to a secret area. complete the area and you get the green gem..."
5,Crash Bandicoot!,"I got this game for my sister and for myself also :D And it is better quality condition that what i get from used-game stores. The game worked perfect, and not a single scratch on the disc. Great Amazon buy!"
4,Great squeal to the orginal,"This squeal to the original Crash Bandicoot game lives up to its name. With great gameplay, levels, and new characters, you'll be setting in front of the TV for a while."
3,it will work,Not as good as the old one that had the plastic protective cover over the key pad and an actual snap close as opposed to this magnetic thing...but it will serve the purpose. The old one lasted me over 4 years of daily abuse. This one is OK but not nearly the quality of the old one. One thing good was I received it quickly.
4,Best Case Available,"I have owned 2 of these and am about to buy my third. They are good looking, functional, protect my phone. I purchased this Krusell case for two reasons:1: The belt clip wraps around the belt. It virtually never pops off of my belt. Others use a spring-clip that kept popping off sending the phone bouncing down the street. Finally my phone was stolen when I didn't see it popped off on an airplane seat.2: The business card pocket allows easy identification of my phone. The airline told me their policy of never turning on an electronic device even to determine it's owner. With my business cards in the case, they can still get my name/phone information.I have three concerns.1: The memory card pockets are worthless and push the buttons when used.2: The phone plug doesn't align perfectly at the bottom, but it is still usable.3: The plastic clip that I love, breaks after 2 or so years of daily use. I can only glue it back together so many times, then it's back to buy another."
2,Not durable,"General design good but... My phone fell out and broke because the bottom snap became unfastened. When I stepped down from my truck the two snaps in the back opened and my phone dumped out. I used a hair tie to loop over the antenna and this worked. After months of opening and closing the snaps wore out, and wouldn't stay closed. I used JB weld so they wouldn't open anymore. The bottom opening was never the right size to plug in for hot sync or charging. Easier if I removed phone from case. Finally, the multidapt clip stitched to the back of the phone broke. Same as other reviewer. One side of the slide track broke. Luckily, I found it on the floor at work. All this within one year."
4,Best case I own,"I own many cases, but this is the best one of them. Well made however a minor flaw in stiching around the interior makes this fall short of 5 stars. Overall amazing design; functionality at its most attractive."
2,Not for you if you use the headset jack,"I should have listened to the guy who did the other review and mentioned this. When the krussel is advertised, it states that it's made perfectly to fit the detail of the phone. They make it seem as if for each port you will have no problems accessing them. But that is not the case. I agree with the other guy who said when using the headset jack it doesn't fit properly. I have problems as well. What happens is it keeps coming out when you push the headset in. The case is too bulky in that area or something. I've gotten to the point where I just take my phone out of the case to listen to the MP3 player, and I shouldn't have to do that. As it is designed for you to be able to access the headset jack when the phone is in the case. So before purchasing this just ask yourself, If you're not able to use it the way it was intended, then do you really want or need to buy this case? I learned the hard way. I didn't listen. Don't let this happen to you."
5,Best Combo,The combination of these 2 movies is great. The widescreen version adds a lot of the scene that you could not see in the fullscreen version.
1,This Isn't Enough!!!,"Warner Brothers does not seem to understand the loyalty of its genre audiences. There are two seasons of Batman: The Animated Series to be available soon and the first season of Superman: The Animated Series is on its way as well. Justice League was something its potential audience waited for with bated breath--it doesn't make any sense to not give it the same treatment. Give us ALL the episodes of the seasons in a box set like the others. I would skip out on these paltry offerings, and it seems that the same thing is going to occur with JL Unlimited, so I'll skip out on those as well and wait for the box sets."
4,Sole Provider,A must for a sneaker head or nike lover. I had this book before an I needed another copy .
4,Trip to Your Heart,"This album's greatness is only diminished by Sly & the Family Stone's subsequent efforts. Check out ""Trip to Your Heart"" to hear where LL Cool J got the groovy sample for ""Mama Said Knock You Out"""
1,I'm glad I didn't buy it,I was glad I borrowed this DVD before buying it. It's just Bill Moyers talking to people about September 11th and their opinions. I want to collect as much as I can in regards to September 11th for my childern and their childern. It's part of our history just like Pearl Harbor. This DVD is not worth buy.
5,SO HAPPY,"Wow, I've watched this, yet I was more amazed with the performance of ""You Make Me So Very Happy""! I laughed at the poor 'lip sync' of Paul & Otis, but I still loved it! This is in my collection for sure and if you're a big fan, you will purchase it!"
5,The Picture Is What You Get!,"This review is going to be short and sweet, the picture is what you get. The ring is stylish and simple and goes with anything silver. The black allows it to match with whatever my wife wairs and has real good thickness and heavy weight so its not flimsy and definately won't bend when my wife keeps tapping her fingers on the desk or table ;) I personaly think its got a very classy look."
2,Missing critical tone markers and particles,This book is required by my Mandarin instructor of a local university level Continuing Education non-credit course. Personally I do not find this book resourceful in my Mandarin studies as it is missing critical tone markers and particles in the vocabulary and sentence structures. The chapters are not very structured according to category as the author is not very detailed in writing this book. Too many gross visible errors!
3,"Text Ok, CD's Terrible","This text book is okay, but not stellar as far as language texts go. There doesn't seem to be enough practice dialogue or examples of how the words are used in everyday conversation. It just needs to be fleshed out a little - the information is too sparse. The accompanying CD's, however, are TERRIBLE. They rush through the words and conversation with no pause at all, so you have no time to even figure out what they are saying, much less try to repeat it yourself. There is no repetition either. I don't use the CD's at all anymore - they're useless."
5,Never gets old,"Ive watched it from the first to last, last show to first, and every other way. I learned more about NASA, Apollo Program, and the moom from this."
1,Aspect ratio is NOT 1.33:1,"I give this one star not because of the series - that easily rates 5 stars or more - but because the info for this version says it is in a 1.33:1 aspect ratio. The box is labeled 16:9. I already own the Signature Edition, which is also 16:9, but I was hoping to get a copy that was produced like the original series - in 4:3!If you don't care about what the producers did to the video to make it ""widescreen"", by all means, this is TV at its very best and I cannot recommend it highly enough. But if you're expecting 4:3, look elsewhere."
5,Outstanding,"This series was great! I especially liked the portrayals of Wally Schirra, Niel Armstrong, Alan Shepard and Buzz Aldrin. The special effects were seamless, and the score couldn't be better. I thought the Apollo 13 segment was the low point in the series, and the maudlin Apollo 15 episode was a bit much. Other than that, bravo Mr. Hanks. He keeps reinforcing that 'national treasure"" title he's benn given."
5,An important piece of our history,"Several of the episodes especially stand out:The first one, showing what a monumental task it appeared to be in the beginning.The Apollo One episode, which shows the human toll of the program in equally human terms.The Apollo 12 episode, which shows, better than the Apollo 11 segment, the ""Gosh, I'm actually on the moon"" factor.The Apollo 15 episode, which shows the science aspect of the program and gives an irrefutable arguement for why we had to send people into space.I hope 1000 years from now this miniseries is looked to as a monument to the beginning, and not just a curious experiment."
3,Great filmmaking - terrible transfer,"The storytelling is excellent. The subject matter is fascinating and inspirational. Truly incredible filmmaking. Unfortunately, the DVD transfer is just terrible! The image quality is shockingly bad with distracting levels of pixelization. As much as they spent producing this series, you'd think they could make the stunning visuals transfer to DVD without these kinds of artifacts. They dropped the ball on the last step on this one."
3,"Great series, but major problems with the sound","While I have to agree with other reviewers that this was a ground-breaking, and thoroughly enjoyable series, I must admit that every disk in my ""Signature Edition"" set (bought from Amazon) was of poor sound quality. At times the music bass was so off that it boomed and vibrated so loudly that I couldn't hear the actors, while other times it was normal. Unfortunately, I don't want to return the set due to shipping costs. But, will I ever be able to re-watch it again with the sound the way it is? No. Will I ever buy another DVD set from Amazon again? I'm not sure. This experience will certainly make me think twice though."
4,Except for the apollo 13 episode...,"Update: 2010-12-30Hmm...interesting. Below is what remains of the review I posted a few years ago. What gives Amazon? Who or what cropped the beginning section out of it?!Speaking of ""Houston, we have a problem""!*****************it is a very good series. I simply don't get that episode---I suppose it was look at how journalism had changed (or was changing) into the worthless condition it now finds itself.If you're into Apollo, this is a must have. IMO, there's never enough that can be written about this era, and this series does indeed do it justice."
5,Great Series!,"This is a terrific series done by HBO and Tom Hanks! If you enjoyed Apollo 13 of the Right Stuff, this is will become one of your favorites, too!"
2,A let down,"Taking back sunday swept the world with Tell all your friends. Tell all your friends was amazing because of the amazing guitar rifts and lyrics. The music of this album is good, but the lyrics are horrible. Dont buy it, dont even burn it, its a waste of a cd.I for one am quite depressed over this because I was hoping for an amazing sequal to tell all your friends and it simply does not compare."
1,Not Punk,"Alright, don't get immediately mad just because of the rating, I don't care if anyone likes this music, as long as people stop calling it punk, it is a far cry way from these guys to the original punks (clash, sex pistols, etc.) who, before you complain about this simple fact, all released albums over twenty years before any of these bands existed, in 1977, so, while I respect the music these bands play, it is definitely not punk in it's true form although it may be very slightly influenced by punk."
1,This Band Sucks,This could possibly be the worst band of all time. This album is like a giant nail constantly being banged into my brain over and over again. I'd rather listen to Britney Spears any day of the week. Seriously if you were thinking about buying this album save your money and your time because its not at all worth it.
4,Where I Want to Be,"This album has its goods and its bads. Mostly they're goods. I pretty much got this album for ""This Photograph Is Proof"".""You see it's never bad enough to just leave or give upbut it's never good enough to feel right"".Sometimes the dual vocals make me shudder at how much they suck, but if you look past them, this is a good emo release. Emo-Kids will blindly worship this album as they do anything with an ""emo"" tag on it. But if you just got out of a bad relationship this album will give you something to relate to.I'm manly and I can't possibly listen to this, though. Back to the Red Chord."
2,2ND EFFORT DOESN'T MATCH THE FIRST,"I was uber excited to get the new TBS cd. Tell all your friends was an amazing cd which is hard to take out of the cd player. But don't buy this cd expecting the first one. This cd has a whole new sound, its more poppy and radio friendly than the first. Its my personal opinion that this change has hurt the bands sound but some people like the new sound. I like their old one better and their old sound, but check it out for yourself, you might like it more."
4,GO OUT AND BUY THIS CD!!!,"ok. so i absolutely LOVE this cd!!!!! and i think everybody should go out and buy it but honestly i thnk tell all your friends was better. john nolan never should have left the band. also, the lyrics on tayf were much more uhh... meaningful?!"
1,Doesn't fit turntable,The hole in the center of this record is too small for the metal piece in the center of a standard turntable. It got stuck the second I put it on there and was unable to play. It was destroyed in my attempt to wrench it off of there. Wish I could get a refund.
2,Bleh,"I don't know how people can like this band so much. The only good song on this CD is Decade Under The Influence, thats it. All the other songs are too overdramatic, boring, sappy, and just dont hold your interest. These guys aren't really very musically gifted either, nothing on this album is amazing music wise. If you want some half decent emo, get The Used's new one."
5,yeh,"Honestly I like Tell All Your Friends and this album equally the same. They both have their share of great songs. I would reccomend buying this CD before you buy Tell All Your Friends so it gives you the older sound of TBS first. Slowdance On The Inside is one the best songs on this CD, I highly reccomend for anyone to buy this CD who is into EMO, punk, or even posthardcore bands like FFTL, Silverstein, and underOATH"
2,Not Good Very Boring,"I didn't enjoy this cd at all. I've never listened to their 1st one but after listening to WYWTB I'm not sure if I should give it a chance. The only 3 good songs are 1(not wonderful), 3(excellent), and the last one. This album gets old fast and the songs get repeditive. Also I like screamo bands but they barely scream. Some people like that but I find it soooooooo boring. Don't buy this c.d. get a friend to burn it for you or just forget about it!"
3,Twisting the ordinary and grotesque to build connections,"All individuals can somehow connect to each character presented in Anderson's carefully constructed novel. Tales of loneliness, fanaticism, peculiarity, isolation, guilt, and religion build a bridge between each of the townsfolk, illustrating that they are not alone in the small town of Winesburg, Ohio.Amazingly, the reader doesn't feel alone as well..."
3,Ununified,Character development in each chapter is excellent. But the character's stories and back-stories aren't unified into a whole. Attempts at social commentary are ham-handed.
1,"Winesburg, Ohio","I tried and tried, but I could not get into this book. Finally gave up about half-way through. Couldn't see wasting any more time when I have tons of books that I want to read."
1,Disjointed dribble.,"""Winesburg, Ohio"" is one of the worst books I have ever read. I have no problem with dreary and bleak books - as long as they have a purpose. I do not see any point in this book. I found Sherwood Anderson's writing to be babbly and incoherent at times - as if he was writing the first thought that came into his head. I felt that he was just using many words to take up space. The characters were not fully developed and they all had the same characteristics and personalities - there was no versatility. This book is a complete waste of reading time. I do not recommend."
2,Fair Sound recording quality,"One buys a DVD audio expecting superior, better then CD sound quality. Quality of this recording by todays standards pretty low. If the original recording is it won't become better if you issue it on a DVD without some significant editing and even with that there's only so much you can do to improve."
2,VX8300 users beware!,"This cable will not fit your phone without modification. There are three plastic ""tabs"" on the bottom side of the plug. The VX8300 requires the middle one to be shaved down with an xacto knife. The remaining two outside tabs are somewhat wider than the phone will accept. After shaving the middle tab down, gently wiggle the connector side-to-side into your phone to shave the two outside tabs into the required profile. FYI: The sticker on this phone says ""LG-6100/5200/7000"". I gave it two starts instead of 1 since it does charge my phone (after doing this mod) and the genuine LG charger was $23 more."
2,I remembered Sinatra as better ...,"I guess I'm the only one here who really disliked this. I remembered Sinatra fondly from childhood, so bought this CD, but took it off halfway through. It's not that it wasn't jazzy enough for me ... I just hated how he starts the note flat and slides up to it - and then, even when he was finally dead on pitch, the quality of his voice was displeasing. I'm listening to Andy Williams now - at least he sounds as if he knows how to sing."
2,Let down by Sinatra,"While I love the carol, 'Have yourself a merry little Christmas', the rest of the album has too much spoken word to enjoy."
5,Very Fun,"Excellent Record. Great mix of tunes. Here's a guy who carries on the tradition of L. Armstrong, instead of just trying to leach off it."
1,"A ""MEI AH LASER DISC CO. LTD"" DVD","This is a comment about this version of Jet Li's Dr. Wai, issued by ""MEI AH"", and not a review of the movie itself. Because despite more than a dozen tries on two different computers I was unable to get the English subtitles to appear. And as I neither speak Mandarin or Cantonese, I had no idea what the movie was all about. I therefore threw it out.And here is an additional comment: There is another DVD, also issued by ""MEI AH"", this time of Jet Li's ""Hitman"", which although it plays well, cannot be advanced or backtracked scene by scene, only from chapter to chapter.Conclusion: As I never had problems like these with DVDs issued by other companies, I will make sure not to buy any DVDs issued by ""MEI AH"" in the future!"
3,Jet Li as Indiana Jones,"this movie is different......not your usual Jet Li Movie. Jet Li meets with Cousin Yee again...Jet Li is pretty funnny in this movie and he smiles a lot.he's a Chinese professor that is looking for a scripture with no words because it predicts future and stuf. and the Japs are looking for it too. the timeline is when China was gettin invaded by Japan or been invaded.Cousin Yee plays a Japanese Officer trying to lure Jet Li, they fall in love( like other movies) then..."
4,this was a fun game,I love this game. It is so fun to play and I can never put it down. My favorite is the Undertaker and his gloomy ring. Buy this game and you'll have fun
2,This game was poor but not bad,"Some of the features in this game were okay, but there should have been a lot more wrestlers, better graphics and other things. But overall it really bites."
2,This game sucked!,I have played many Wrestling Games before and out of all of them this had to be the worst games I ever played. This was more of a fighting game not a wrestling game! I do not reccomend to get this game!
2,false advertising,"I am very dissatisfied with this dvd.The cover and the disc inside say 2009 and it looks new,however upon putting in the disc I realize it is old footage form 2001 which the dvd states in the end.Now I love other dvd's from Leslie and I do the workouts every week but I did not want an old production.I would say be aware that they are repackaging old workouts with updated covers to get you to think they are new!What a bummer!Also the stretchy band inside is not even used in the exercises."
5,Great Addition,"Are you a Leslie Sansone fan and want variety, get this one! I started with Walk Away the Pounds Express and really love them but I wanted a variety of workouts; this is perfect. You get the same workouts as in her Power Series but for A LOT less money. Try it, you won't be disappointed."
4,One of the best releases of the early Seventies,"It was here that Nilsson must have heard the emotive and beautiful song, ""Without You,"" and it is on NO DICE that the song gets its best interpretation ever. Badfinger does it the justice it deserves, their emphasis bestowing a degree of sorrow that Nilsson missed. True to the Beatle-like style that they were known for, the album is full of pleasant early-seventies style rockers that makes it enjoyable from start to finish. Their first big hit, ""No Matter What,"" is a great song that hints at what will follow on STRAIGHT UP two years later. This one is a little better sounding than the Capitol/EMI release, which is scheduled for deletion."
4,"Stop slamming the printing, you fools!","These reprints look exactly the same as from my original pressings of the Warren material. True, Warren wasn't the best in printing colored comics, especially not of Corben-caliber, but that's no reason to slam this collection for their mistakes.This is a great collection.The ocassional odd front & last pages only printed in B&W; or in Red; that's EXACTLY how they were printed in the originals. Which I commend them for."
3,the man behind the curtain,"-nice to know of 'the man behind the curtain', the truth behind the disney goings on. its' nice to know too, that disney was mostly a salesman with lots of animation skills. the achievements of iwerks are indeed stunning. what really is a shame is that the genius behind 'the pincushion man' couldn't stay successful on his own. there is no way disney would have been as successful without iwerks!!! -a really good 'read'!!"
3,Better Than You Expect,"I avoided this record for years because I expected it to be the ""crap"" that the title ironically, and perhaps unintentionally, implies. However, while CTC is no London Calling, it's not crap either.If this was released as the first Joe Strummer solo album, it would have been praised as a great blend of classic Clash feel, with modern (for the mid-80's) touches, such as synthesizers and electronic drums. Instead, it comes off as a shameless attempt to drain the last of the blood out of the Clash legacy with some stand-ins and studio hacks.That being said, there are plenty of good songs. Ignoring the context and judging it purely on music, I'd rank it ahead of Combat Rock."
2,"This is the Clash's ""Indian War Whoop""","This widely despised recording actually reminds me of another widely scorned recording - Indian War Whoop - by an equally influential group of musicians, the Holy Modal Rounders. When I first heard Indian War Whoop, a record apparently recorded while the musicians were tripping heavily on LSD, it was unlistenable, and I regretted buying it. But, with later listens, it sort of grew on me. I don't listen to it often, but when I do, I recognize a real musical core.So too with this mess of a record. It's really not the Clash, but there are a core of halfway decent songs. It's not a great record by any means, but not nearly as bad as many would suggest. I suppose, though, that it deserves to be seen as a footnote to the Clash's, and Joe Strummer's, otherwise fine musical careers.I could really do without the drum machines, both here, and just about everywhere (with perhaps a few exceptions, such as Nine Inch Nails, Ministry, and a handful of techno acts)."
3,"Great, Except for the False Advertising","These are great movies, each with Luhrmann's bombastic eye candy flare and anachronisms.But ... big problem with the Romeo & Juliet disc. The packaging listed all kinds of features from interviews to commentary, but there were none to be found on the disc. All it offered in the ""Extra Features"" section was a trailer. Seriously. I haven't checked the other discs yet.Buyer beware until Fox recalls and remedies."
3,Weak but Good,"HEY - Steps could have done a bit better. I am an owner of every single of their singles & albums from Britain and this is a compilation of those. I still think that they should have released the 20trk Gold album here but here are my reviews out of five:1 TRAGEDY 22 ONE FOR SORROW 53 STOMP 44 ITS THE WAY YOU MAKE ME FEEL 55 LOVES GOT A HOLD ON MY HEART 36 HEARTBEAT 47 BETTER BEST FORGOTTEN 28 SAY YOULL BE MINE 19 DEEPER SHADE OF BLUE 3105,6,7,8 111LAST THING ON MY MIND 312CHAIN REACTION 513WORDS ARE NOT ENOUGH 4So this CD is not the best - well this is only my opinion. So buy it and see what you think for yourself."
5,No More Sleepless Nights,This is an excellent book written primarily by the former director of Sleep Disorders at the Mayo Clinic to assist you in self-diagnosis of insomnia. I received it from Amazon in a timely manner and in the condition stated in the ad. I like it so much that I would order it again.
1,Boring,"Each chapter repeated itself from the one before. I read about one third of the book and never felt like I got to the ""meat"" of how to have no more sleepless nights. They kept telling you you would, but never got around to it. I just got bored with it."
5,This is probaly the best game for its time,"When i first got this game i really liked and played it for a long time.But what i did not know was the people who were called nobodys because i find out that they have Terry Funk ,Jushin Thunder Liger ,Hawk and many other .I also like this game for it wide viarety out of moves .Moves you wont see in the U.S.So i say if you like good wrestling then get this game."
2,Title not so appropriate,"This book has 3 sections in it; only 1 is about blacksmithing, well kind of. Also i didn't see anything 'modern' in it. The authors suggestion for eye protection is to 'squint' while grinding or performing other jobs where sharp bits of metal may impale your eyeballs. This book is for the person either living in a 3rd world country or for someone surviving any end-of-the-world scenerio you can imagine. End-of-the-world projects include how to make a nice end mill from a hex-head bolt using only a file and making other misc stuff from discarded automobile parts. And those scisors and pliers on the cover of the book, well the author suggests you can make those using about 100 hours of squinting grinder time."
5,Truly Wonderful Book,"This is a truly great book which offers an alternative to the 'mainstream' parenting ideas of letting babies ""cry it out"". Other parents, health professionals and friends all told me that I must let my baby cry himself to sleep. I couldn't do it. This book has given me the theory and ideas behind my own instincts and has made me excited and enthusiastic about parenting. I will be reading this book for years. I have lent it to all my friends. This book takes some of the best ideas about parenting, sleep, discipline, feeding and raising a family that I have seen and puts them all into one easy to read and wonderful book. You won't regret purchasing this book if you believe in the rights of your child and the importance of parenting well!"
3,preachy,"This book is a must if you are into natural living, however, you have to take Peggy with a grain of salt. To live by all her suggestions is a very unrealistic goal. What I've done is read her book, and make educated decisions on my own."
1,Shame on you.,"Thug, you shame your profession. Violence towards peaceful people is unconstitutional. You should be in jail for treason. How can you live with yourself?"
4,"My favorite B,S and T album","This is a favorite mainly because Dave Bargeron joins the horn section. That's him all over redemption and his tuba adds more depth. Plus, he wrote Mama gets high with Steve Katz and that's his horn arrangement too.This album is not as strong as some of the other B,S and T. But, Dave Bargeron playing more than makes up for it."
5,Their best recording ever!,"This cd is excellent! All the tracks are remarkable, however, ""Redemption"" ""John the Baptist"" and ""Cowboys and Indians"" have to be some of the finest arrangements and overall musicianship ever recorded by a horn band or any band for that matter! Simply an exciting and inspiring achievement. One of my top twenty cds."
5,Best album yet,"Without being verbose, this is the best of B,S&T's albums. I can think of no higher compliment to give any CD."
5,Give me more!!!!,"Kayak's second studio album after the reunion, and the first to feature Bert Heerink on the vocals and Rob Vunderink on the guitars. These to new guys really added a new sound to this Kayak-album. The have convinced me that this is their best studio album since the reunion.The opening is an 8-minute plus epic about Icarus. Beautiful, and Heerink sung it very emotional, he sings that way in every song. Miracle Man is also very good. All of the songs are very well done except Tradition. That song has a nice guitar-riff, but it's too longwinded. Can't help to say that there are pieces of the song which deserve the name: superfluous. But the rest is well done. Now that they have two guitarists it sounds a little nicer.I recommend this to Kayak-fans and if you are new to Kayak, this might be the right compact disc to get you into Kayak.Keep On Rocking!!!"
2,Disappointing,"The reproduction of Strand's New Mexico photographs is as poor as the old photo books of the 1950s. About half the book is images and the other half is largely excerpts of letters to and from Strand during this sad period of his life. Strand's compositions are, as always, perfect; but I don't think that his heart was in it. Mostly landscapes, views of the Taos church, and portraits of his soon-to-be-ex wife Rebecca, they compare poorly with the Southwest work of St. Ansel and Steiglitz's photos of Georgia O'Keefe. As a Strand fan, I am very disappointed."
4,Met with approval,"I recently attended a 40 hour session of master classes that focused on interpretation of Baroque music on the modern guitar. Most of the attendees were students at conservatories - the general consensus was that this edition is superb. There may be others as good, but this one is certainly up to standard. During the class, we often referred to this edition to correct errors in the other student's scores.Of course, any transcription for the guitar makes changes, drops some notes, looses some voices, etc. The maestro's opinion (a specialist in music of the period) was that the compromises in this edition are quite fine.Of course, one should always have as close to the original texts as possible for reference."
2,Poor Quality for the Price,The price is high for this cheap lighter. It rarely lights on the first click and I found it difficult to fill up. The waterproofing appears durable but I have not tested this yet. It lights in moderate wind but not did not stay lit in stronger winds. Don't count on this as reliable in the toughest conditions.
1,Chinese-made Junk,"this lighter offers very little in the way of flame control and fuel observation; after filling, no fuel level is visible - the 'flame' is quite diminutive and not very visible - would only light after maxing out the flame control - not worth the price, IMO, but i guess you get what you pay for - don't expect to use this lighter for cigars, lighting BBQs, or other tasks - it won't work - it's more designed for cigarettes"
2,Not the Best Choice,"In preparing for a four-week trip to Costa Rica I bought three travel guides: Moon Handbook, Lonely Planet and Footprint. Of these, I found Footprint to be the least useful and did not bring it along to Costa Rica. Unlike the other two guides, I found its descriptions of places to stay, eat, and visit to be too brief to get much of a sense of what the places were really like."
5,Classic Hit Film Finally Available in Theatrical Widescreen!,"Bravo for a well done DVD of a classic hit movie! AIRPORT has previously only been shown in widescreen on cable television, in letterbox format. Those who bought their own copy for home viewing had to settle for a full screen pan and scan edition, which leaves out a great deal of the movie's main attraction, its spectacle, not to mention a number of the ""artsy"" split-screen shots which were in vogue at the time.If you are waiting for a definitive edition of AIRPORT for home viewing, this is a value. Excellent theatrical sound and anamorphic widescreen picture for maximum resolution even on your big screen. The movie score is a classic, too, and sounds great. The picture clarity and color are excellent, making this quite a bargain in Universal Pictures/Good Times home entertainment -- a big budget, all star cast motion picture for less than the price of two tickets to a revival screening."
1,Terrible. Don't waste your time or money.,"To say I was disappointed would be a vast understatement. I had hoped for an interesting autobiography of the Greaseman, but all I got was a lame collection of ""bits"" from his radio show. Grease: Don't quit the radio job, 'cause you certainly can't write. (By the way, there is no ""glossary of Greasemanese terminology"" as advertised)."
4,Good Collection of Lee Perry Productions,"When I saw this in the store, I was intrigued because it contained a number of tracks that I'd read about in the liner notes of other Lee Perry collections, but didn't actually appear on these collections. Songs like ""Return of Django"" (Perry and the Upstters' first big international hit), and Junior Byles' ""Place Called Africa"" and ""Beat Down Babylon"". Also noteworthy is a Junior Murvin song that doesn't appear on his ""Police and Thieves"" album. The sound quality is a bit disappointing though-- at least one of the tracks seems to be have mastered off a faded, dusty vinyl copy! Also, do we really need another collection with Bob Marley and the Wailers' ""Duppy Conquerer"" and ""Small Axe"" on them (great though those songs are). Still, there's a lot to treasure here, although fans of Perry's more bizarre effects laden stuff might be disappointed."
1,Author is too vain for me,I only found this book interesting in the parts where the author is talking about the end of her friend Lucy's life.
1,The perfect book to reference in a term paper,"Being a psych major and having an interest in the bonds between women and how important those friendships are in our lives, I hoped this would be a positive book I could share with friends and pass on to future clients. Contrary to one reader, I don't feel Patchett used Lucy's death as an opportunity to cash in. However, despite her best intentions to chronicle the difficulties and tragedies in her best friend's life and evoke in the reader a fondness for Lucy, I found it difficult to feel sorry for her (Lucy) and at times was even annoyed by her neediness. Worse yet, no-one seemed to mind terribly. No doubt Lucy suffered a great deal during her life, but I feel much could have been done to save her had someone had the courage to show the tough love she needed. Even if it was not the author's intent, the book could prove a helpful tool in psychology classes and to psychologists by providing a text-book example of extreme co-dependence."
3,Where are the Critical Details?,"I read and reread this book. To be frank, it gave me the creeps. Ann and Lucy have a weird, co-dependent relationship. Ann is clearly obsessed with Lucy, an obsession that began when they lived together in graduate school. Even after they moved apart, the obsession continued. Ann and Lucy dated men, but the two women enjoyed a deep bond--a bond so deep that that Ann seemed ""depressed"" when they were apart--and Lucy fell into a series of promiscuous relationships with men.Their friendship, as deep as it was, had lesbian overtones. Oddly enough, the ""L"" word does not come up in this book. Three of my straight girlfriends who read this book wondered about the implied bisexuality. We could not agree whether it was emotional, psychological, psychic, or physical. The details are hazy. Where is Lucy's side of the story?I recommend the book, but wish it were a little more forthcumming about certain details."
1,"Lots of Beauty, Little Truth","Ann and Lucy are the best of friends. They spend their spare time having intense conversations. They ""love"" each other. Lucy is a complicated person who lashes out at anyone who dares to confront her---about drug abuse, for example. She is a ""writer"" who doesn't write much. Ann writes extensively and Lucy is jealous.I couldn't understand their unlikely attaction. Lucy doesn't seem to have any redeeming qualities. She has sex but doesn't have friends. She turns on her fans. Doesn't pay bills. Her rage is unbelievable.Yes, Ann's prose is beautiful. But where is the content? I was baffled by this book."
5,This Is Art,"I appreciate Ann Patchett for having created this work and for having shared it with the rest of us. With words, she made a portrait of pure friendship--really, a sacred love that I believe Ms. Patchett experienced as a gift during her lifetime.I saw myself in Lucy and in Ann and recognized the truth and the beauty that appear when a heart is open to see--I mean really see. Love Love Love this book. Heaven knows we can benefit from a story that teaches something about love and friendship that is possible even if the participants are (gasp) imperfect humans. Lucy Grealy experienced a truthful and beautiful friendship during her lifetime, and that cannot be stated as the case for all people."
3,Hmmm?,"Lucy was so unlikeable, self-absorbed, infantile, and one-dimentional that I just didn't care what happened to her.The only good thing about this story is that Patchett wrote it so well--hence the three stars."
5,an unusual friendship,"What is a friend, and how much can one give to another? Can a friendship be sustained when one demands so much of the other? The answer given in this memoir is ""yes"".This is a beautifully written piece that explores the remarkable friendship of two talented women authors."
4,I don't get it either!,"Clearly the author loved Grealy...what is unclear is whether Grealy returned that love or was a manipulative user. I found few redeeming qualities in the person described by Patchett and found myself a bit disgusted with Grealy's cavalier treatment of all and sundry, including her refusal to pay off any debts she incurred in the course of her life. The final straw came when I read her reaction to 9-11. I wanted to send her drug-abusing self back to Ireland and let its citizens support her.In doing more research, I see that her twin sister is angry with Patchett for hijacking the Grealy family's grief. I find that equally offensive. It seems the entire family shares an *all about me* gene.Nevertheless, I recommend this book. It is a tale of a narcissist enabled by friends and family who led a chaotic and not particularly productive life (at least by professional writer's standards) who finally found a lover in heroin that wasnt as forgiving as the people in her life."
4,Still makes good sense today,"I read this book in late 1942. The book was first published in 1925. The people referred to in the title are George Bernard Shaw, H. G. Wells, Conan Doyle. Friedrich Nietzsche, Ernest Haeckel, Mark Twain, and Anatole France. The author interprets their worthless substitute for religion and concludes the choice is either Christ or chaos. Some might be surprised to see Conan Doyle and Mark Twain in this lineup, but Doyle was big on spiritualism and Twain had a character in A Connecticut Yankee at King Arthur's Court want to convert sixth centruy Britain to Protestantism which of course did not exist in the sixth century"
3,"Overall decent, but missing some cases and lousy software","Overall, the Casebriefs has been tremendously useful for me. However, it is missing some significant cases from LaFave. And the software interface is amazingly bad and not user friendly. These days even shareware software programs have friendly, effective interfaces. Gilbert Law needs to spend a couple dollars and have someone re-write their software interface program.Kent"
3,"Mainstream, End of the Age and Incident on a Bridge","Those three songs mentioned in the subject line are good enough to buy this outing. Of course those three songs are written by Kerry Livgren, and they are very strong songs, with strong lyrics. Not for the weakminded. The other songs are really hit and miss.. and quite frankly aren't that good. The singing on the songs are very good, they just can't be saved.ALL that aside... this is a good CD to get for the three songs mentioned. Those three songs are heavy and good.Particulary MAINSTREAM. This song is one of the meanest songs that KL has ever written. Pretty much puts the music industry on notice for the shallowness and overt commercialization of artist and ultimatley FANS. And it rocks."
5,Overlooked classic!,"Do not overlook this amazing album. This album gets maligned in much the same way that Gentle Giant's ""Civilian"" does. Both very good examples of how bands evolve over the course of their careers. Do not be swayed by the fair-weather fans, instead listen with an open mind."
2,Hard to remove from case,"In order to recharge the ipod it needs to be removed from the case. The problem is, it is difficult to get out of the case. I have had to ""pry"" it out. Because of this the plastic strap at the top is tearing. I wouldn't purchase again."
5,A long-time Australian Johnny Winter fan.,"We all know the story. Johhny came staggering out of Texas in the late 60's and then out of detox around '73 and this was his sort of ""come back"" album. The vocals have a magnificent ragged quality to them and I love all the tracks, even though it's not really a blues album as such. But the best thing about this album are those two monstrousr riffs that begin ""All Tore Down"" and ""Can't you feel it?"" respectively. Shit, they may well be two of the greatest riffs I have ever heard and I've heard thousands of 'em. If you are a sucker for a couple of chords straight from heaven, then these tracks were made for you. Worth it just for that alone but a fine album anyway."
1,This disc has XBOX 360 HD DVD issues,"When I first got this disc the other day, it would not play at all. I installed the latest firmware update to my XBOX360 HD drive, and it played. However, it does not play well at all. The video is constantly ""dragging"" or skipping. The audio is fine though.I can't really provide a review of the content since, so far, it is unwatchable.This is the only disc that has given me issues."
4,alice is awesome,"I love Alice Cooper, and watching this brought back memories of concert days. I found myself sitting in my living room singing and screaming ALICE"
3,Interesting show but not stellar,The video quality a good but not as good as I would have expected. The audience does not appear no be into the show until the end.
3,It's OK,we bought this bed at the store and when we got it home and carefully unpacked it - 3 pieces were broke. Babies R Us wouldn't exchange it we had to call the manufacture to ship us out new pieces which takes 2-5 weeks. It's been 2 weeks and still haven't recieved the new pieces. My only suggestion is when you buy it at the store make them open it and check all the pieces before walking out.
5,"Excellent, revealing, thouroughly enjoyable","I really enjoyed this book. It gave a wonderful glimpse into the real world of professional dancing. Miss Bentley told this story with beautiful language, her words flowed like water. I found it wonderful to know what it was like to live the life of a dancer, to know the struggles and the victories, the fantasies and the realities. I recommend this book for all who love dance and for anyone interested in show business or simply anyone who enjoys a good read."
4,They got the wrong guy,"No quibble with the music, but they've got the wrong Pete Rodriguez. ""El Conde"" was a salsa singer. Fix the id3 tags in the mp3 file and you'll be all set."
4,Romantic movie for the people over 35,"I'm glad to see that they do make romantic films with middle age couples in it. And she is about 7 years older! What is interesting because it's half in French and the other half English speaking.I used to have a crush on William Hurt in the '80s. He has that languid yet intelligent sexuality about him (like Nicolas Cage). Yes, I know that sounds weird...what can I say?I recommend this movie for anyone over 40. Or at least in their late 30s."
4,These mini croutons stay crunchy,"These canisters are about the size of a Rockstar can and contain enough mini croutons to dress several family sized salads for the dinner table, depending how heavy handed you are with the shaker. My hubby and I use about a can a week with nightly salads.These canisters also contain red bell pepper flakes(sweet, not hot) and spices mixed with the croutons, it is a very tasty mix and really perks up a salad.You could also keep one of these in your desk at work to dress up those supermarket salads you buy for lunch.I even tried topping a casserole with them because they are mini sized and thought they would add great flavor and crunch to a tuna casserole, they tasted great and were better than crushed potato chips.12 cans may seem like a lot, but I find it is nice to have a good sized supply in the pantry. They come in pop top cans that stay very fresh a long time.The price here on amazon is the best I have found!"
4,Worth a listen,"Some New Yorker critic cited this disc as one of his ten best of the year. I'm not sure I'd agree, but it does merit a try or two if you might be so inclined.The album represents an effort to fuse electronica into more traditional carribean and salsa musics. Indeed, smooth downtempo electronic beats merge with carribean vocal work and horns in a most enjoyable way. My only critique is that I didn't find that the album has any sort of overarching cohesiveness. It seems to hop from one song to the next without going very far.On the whole, I found it to be a fun melange of tunes and worth a listen."
2,Not what I had in mind,"The brewing instructions in this book were rudimentary at best, and the use of raw eggs in many of the drinks is questionable. Overall, I found that the book focussed far too much on recipes for sodapop, herbal teas, fruit-juices and Starbucks-like coffee recipes. The larger portion of the recipes in this books are Mz. Telesco's own concoctons. I was expecting more recipes for traditional drinks such as ale, mead, wine, etc... but, the recipes that they did give contained very brief,simplistic brewing instructions that had me a bit worried. This book was a bit dissappointing, really. If you like fanciful, sweet drinks and are not concerned with their religious and historical authenticity, then by all means, buy this book. Otherwise, save your money and get The Alaskan Bootlegger's Bible, a far more accurate and thorough guide."
5,"Yummy, Thirst quenching & Diversified","It's amazing to see how many different beverages have had spiritual applications in history, and how many ingredients in even modern beverages have magickal applications. I can drink my magickal energy any time I wish now... great fun and good magick"
4,Serious Drama set against backdrop of Christmas...,"In many regards this movie comes across much like a stage play. Starring Jason Robards and Julie Harris, who are two of this nation's finest actors it is a poignant tale of a a widower who 'rents' a woman to be his companion over the Christmas holiday weekend. It is a bittersweet movie, but a fine one stemming from a good script with an interesting 'twist' at the end. While perhaps not everyone's 'cup of tea' for a Christmas movie, it is a enjoyable drama."
1,Better Wayyyyy late than never,Finally received about 10 days after I received an email claiming the CD had been mailed
1,Disapponting,I can't believe other reviewers rating it 4 or 5. Few points1. Not in depth coverage of ADO.NET2. Too much MSDN tables and leanghty explanation of every method and properties.3. Stuff doen't belong to ADO.NET4. Some code doen't compile.
4,the ancestor of slapstick comedy,"This old movie is the one of the ancestors of modern slapstick comedy. I don't normally like slapstick - in fact, I diligently avoid it - but I really enjoyed this movie. The stunts are overdone, the expressions and mannerisms exaggerated, the style is absurd, but it's funny. Funny enough to watch repeatedly. Like most of the movies of the era, there's no reason not to let the kids watch it. It's cute and light, and everybody's happy in the end."
2,Earthworm Tractors,"People who haven't read the stories may find this movie very funny, but my husband and I are old enough to have read the 'Earthworm Tractor' stories when published in the Saturday Evening Post.We were disappointed with this movie as Joe E Brown played the role of Alexander Potts, the main character, as a complete idiot. We both like Joe E Brown but this was not a story for his kind of humor, or the director had him play it like that. Whatever, neither of us liked the movie."
3,Works but has some issues,"I use this when riding my motorcycle and it works great in terms of allowing me to talk without having to remove my helmet and earphones. But, it's horribly designed. After losing many batteries when I reached for the switch and had the battery door drop open, sending the battery out onto the highway, I finally took a small piece of black electricians tape and taped it shut. That's working great. I'm happy to have it, but wish they would have thought through some of the design features a little better."
4,Look for a copy with the humorous cover,"Nothing really to add to what other reviewers have said, other than to say you might want to keep your eye out for a copy with the humorous cover. On the copy I have the photo on the front cover has been reversed right-to-left which produces a chess board that is set up incorrectly! Pretty funny for a book that is a classic on chess theory ..."
2,BE CAREFUL!!,"We purchased this exact bed in white for my 19 month old. She had been sleeping well in it for about a week. One night we awoke to her crying to find her trapped UNDER the bed. Her whole body was under the bed and she could not move her head - VERY scary. It took both my husband and myself to lift the bed and get her out. I don't know why or how she did it - but just know it CAN be done. Be careful if your child is a bit restless or curious. She is an average sized toddler too - not very tiny.On the up side, this bed is beautiful and easy to assemble. I agree that the side rails could be a bit longer and higher, but I've obviously got bigger problems!! She is now sleeping in a crib again. Will give this bed a try again in 6 months or so."
4,"Great looking bed, wonderful replacement for crib","We had the Jardine cherry crib with similar lines and colors, so this was a perfect addition to our son's room. It goes beautifully with all of the other furniture, and when we have a second baby the crib and toddler bed will match if we choose to have them share the nursery. I also like that there is a matching nightstand available, which we may add as he gets to the age where he'd be interested in keeping a glass of water nearby (and not just climbing on it!)The only thing keeping this from 5 stars was that the finish did have some nicks and scratches when we opened the box. It wasn't worth sending back, too much hassle and we figured our son would add his own nicks soon enough. But for a $99 toddler bed (there are others that are much cheaper) you expect it to arrive without these dings."
4,Great atmosphere and music makes for a unsettling experience,"This film is easily one of my favorite ""j-horror"" films (it's thai). It's best to do a bit of research though before watching, otherwise it can be a bit confusing. My advice, google ""katoy."" As with most Asian horror the movie requires a bit of acceptance when it comes to the story, I've found that it's best to just accept the twist/ending/motive in most Asian horror because once you start to look deep into the plot the story itself can fall apart in a matter of seconds. Definitely not a bad film though and for someone who rarely gets scared during horror films this one actually scared me quite a bit. Enjoy!"
1,wow,"This movie was just the stupidest movie i've ever seen. It wasn't even scary, the plot was just stupid. But the quality is good."
4,Not for Beginners,"This is an excellent book if you are a seasoned SCO admin. If you really want to get to the nitty gritty of how SCO works then this is the book for you . If you are new to Unix I would recommend the excellent Unix Administration Handbook , it gives a lot more generic sys admin direction ."
3,Who Buy Such Disk?,I read once that those aged over 60 are the collection buyers. Believe me that this is correct. The point is that this CD has such good music that I am proud being in that age.
2,Unlocked wheel can cause a tip over.,"We purchased this stroller because we have a home in the mountains and like to do a lot of hiking and walking. My husband thought the swivel wheel would give us better control. He tried every which way to upset the stroller in the store, but never unlocked the front wheel. First time out of the box we took our four month old for a nice walk, everything was fine until we returned back home and our older daughter leaned onto the front of the stroller and both her and the baby tipped over into the bushes.(the front swivel was unlocked.) The baby was fine thanks to the five point harness, but we were disappointed and frightened that the stroller tipped over. Please becareful if you have older children. We have returned the stroller and are looking for a better alternative with more stability."
5,love it!,"extremely controlable and smooth ride! i usually push with one hand. Great little features like the bags on side, top storage. Big storage bin on bottom. Just seat does not come off to wash apparently. I went through much strollers this far the best!"
1,Not Safe,"This is not the model with the attatched steering wheel and a place to plug in your mp3. This is the base edition. All I can say is it is not safe. I put my 5 monthold son in it and he fell alseep. As with most babies, his head leaned to the side. After only going to my mailbox and back, I noticed a huge egg on the side of my sons head. It was from the stroller. There are laces on either side that you use to adjust the height of the back of the seat. My sons head was rubbing against this string. There is no padding around the string, only covered in the nylon. Maybe it might work for a child who holds themselves upright constantly and doesn't fall asleep, but I truthfully wouldn't recommend this product to anyone! Who wants to see thier child get hurt?"
1,Keep Shopping-Very Dangerous!,"I purchased this stroller because my son is 2 years old and wanted an all-purpose stroller. At first I loved it,then my son began to get his fingers stuck in the harness/buckle strap. My son was also able to turn him self around in the stroller because the tray is so far away from his body. Then one day as I was traveling down the sidewalk on the down ramp the stroller tipped on its side, I was able to catch it. The last and final accident was when my son got his fingers stuck in the harness/ buckle again, so I unstrapped him and he turned around in stroller and leaned on the backrest and the stroller flipped over, whe had a trip to the ER, with a serious lump and two black eyes, and a CAT Scan. Since purchased the Graco Quattro Tour, a nice heavy duty safe stroller, with safe straps and harness, does not tip and my son can't turn around."
2,Various Theses on Various Themes,"This book consists of theses, written by researchers in various fields, on various themes such as hyperreality, fashion, capitalism, postmodernism, and feminism. Therefore, I think that there are some theses in which Baudrillardfs thoughts are not understood at all. The constitution of this book is not so good because each researcher mention freely to various notions without big theme that combines each thesis. It is disappointing that discussions on Baudrillard do not develop between each thesis. If each thesis were complementary to each other, this book would be more interesting and more controversial."
1,Don't Buy These If You Are Flat Footed!,"Warning, do not buy these if you have flat feet. The way they designed these shoes causes extreme pain. I bought these for my son who has flat feet. He can't wear them more than 10 minutes. A coworker's son has the same problem. I did a Google search and found more cases of people with flat feet having problems with this shoe.**UPDATE**My youngest son's feet finally grew to the size of these shoes and he started wearing them. He has normal arches and he loved them! He wore them out actually."
4,soccer cleats,I bought these cleats for my son who played college soccer and is now playing in the mens leagues for fun. He was elated as he really wanted these. I thought after shopping for them for 5 weeks that I would never get them for a reasonable price but lucked out on this site with one pair left that was very reasonable. He loves them but states you have to check them as often as you can to tighten each cleat as best as possible.
3,SUPER SUPREMES BUT POOR PRODUCTION VIDEO,"Although it is always exciting to see the Supremes on video with a big flat screen t.v. and suround sound; I was disapointed in the production of this one. Has anyone at Motown ever heard of remastered sound and colorizing black and white videos? The sound wasn't as good as the original performance on my old tv from 1964 and the video could have been improved to make the black and white picture as sharp as the original show. When it comes to the Supremes lets start thinking of quality reproduction instead of a quick buck! Those of us from the 60's want the highest quality possible for our groups. ""Our memories are all thats left us."" from ""Bookends."" t.c. Ohio"
2,Poor.,Ist film is a sub Live-Feed/Hostel rip off on a budget of $10.002nd film is a rip off of a segment of Dawn of the Dead but on a budget of 5.00$ .Third film is about a necrophiliac who is having an affair with a mannequin.Terribly handled.Budget $5.00This is not a good compendium despite what all the people tell you on here.
5,Fabulous!,"Love the performance! The image quality is not like DVD, but not that intolerable. So, still give it 5 stars."
4,Beautifully put together Performances,"This dvd, in my opinion, has some of the best, belly dance performances, performed by the top belly dancer stars. The performances were captured exceptionally on camera. Great production, very well presented. The choreography from one number to the next has a good bit of variety: lot's of tribal, Ansuya on zills, drum solos, solo and group, island interlude, wings of Isis, awesome double veil. The costumes are gorgeous! It was a fantastic production from the entrance of the stars to the end, return of the stars."
4,A Delightful Bellydancing DVD,"BDSS: Live in Paris features the world's most popular and lovely bellydancers in a videotaped show in France. The highlights of the DVD were Amar Gamal and Kaeshi performing, Dondi Dahlin in her ""Marylin"" dance number, and a Bollywood-style routine. I simply love this edition of the Bellydance Superstars series and recommends anyone who is a bellydance fan to buy it."
4,A true musical genius.,"""El Susto"", ""Por Querer Tener Dos"", ""Al Que Le Pique"", ""La Fuente"" and ""Cachita"" are your reasons for buying this CD. This was one of several Charlie Palmieri albums to feature the smooth-voiced Vitin Aviles (who was, in fact, Charlie's all-time favorite singer) and it offers a truly delightful listening or dancing experience. By the time of this album's release in 1975 (on Alegre Records) Charlie Palmieri had long been recognized by most of his peers as a ""musician's musician"" and most of the tracks on this CD amply prove why this was so. Incidentally, this album was released very shortly before the Alegre label was sold to Jerry Masucci's then-ever-expanding Fania Records empire and was Charlie's final album to be produced by Joe Cain."
5,So Funny Because it's So True,When I saw the title of this book I was hooked and the contents have not let me down. I have been in so many situations that Mellor writes about (turns out the east coast of Florida is an exact replica of LA).When I bought this book I was just looking to be entertained but I find myself actually being encouraged to make sensible decisions for my children. The only downside is that my family is sick of me reading excerpts aloud to them.
3,funny but judgmental,"This very short book is amusing but uneven, as if a blog had been expanded. It wavers between offering real advice (but very basic, such as ""when you travel, pack light"") and humorous faux advice (such as the recommendation to have your child make you cocktails). Towards the end there are unexpectedly imperious warnings about the dangers of TV, which sound a bit like the overbearing parent we as readers have enjoyed mocking for the rest of the book.With the exception of that chapter, the book is a bit of a self-indulgent laugh at over-involved parents and a chance to pat oneself on the back for being more sophisticated. While I agree with nearly everything in the book, I had really wanted to check out of the whole parenting judgment thing, which is tiresome. I think the real revolutionary parenting book will be the one that manages to break out of that cycle of judgment which seems to be incessant now."
2,The Secrets of Eagle Claw Kung Fu: Ying Jow Pai,"THe book does not give any practical information much. As the Title said, it only tells general information about the type of kungFu but contain not much useful information.Don't expect to learn anything from the book.Don't buy except you want to know what it is."
2,Impractical,"The techniques in this book are impractical. The people in the photos are too far away to hit each other with the strikes they use. They block and punch with their other hand at their hip, leaving themselves open to attack. The stances limit mobility and the joint locks can be too complicated to use in a fight. The only thing that I think is useful is the eagle claw, which is used to grab pressure points and choke. I think it shows good hand strengthening exercises and has good acrobatics, if you're interested in fancy flying kicks. The book is probably not worth your money. The only practical styles of kung fu I know of are wing chun and san soo. I recommend all books by Bruce Lee, Sudden Violence, by Master Greg Jones, and Jeet Kune Do Groundfighting, by Alan Ground if you are looking for practical fighting."
1,This book will get you killed!,"The front cover says it all -- no one in their right mind would punch and defend like that in a real fight. If you want to learn how to really defend yourself, skip this book."
4,slick crime story; better than average Elmore Leonard book,"As with most of the other amazon.com reviewers before me I am a loyal Elmore Leonard fan. And it is likely only Elmore Leonard fans would pick up the (relatively obscure) 'Unknown Man #89'. This is unfortunate because most of the world will miss out on this compact jewel.'Unknown Man #89' is one of those stories hard to describe without giving the plot away. Broadly speaking we have con artists trying to make a fast buck off folks whom they thought would be total suckers. Wrong. Frustration and violence ensue. While not winning any awards for originality 'Unknown Man #89' is very well written. Elmore Leonard does a brilliant job on the characterizations, and the prose is very slick. There is also some humour, albeit rather rude and crude.Bottom line: certainly among Leonard's better efforts. Recommended."
1,This Is Shortened Version,"The picture quality may be good BUT this is only 60 minutes of an original 78 minute movie. Why they cut 18 minutes out I don't know but you can find the whole movie on dvd, just not colorized."
3,Story excellent; presentation wanting.,"Since I already own a copy of the Seymour Hicks version, I was ecstatic to see a cosed-caption version being offered. My chagrin was realized when I could find no close caption icon on the case and no close caption feature in the product itself. I just now checked the sale website and it is still! listed as closed-captioned. This Westlake offering looks like the Image offering except it is priced higher. The only difference I see is that the case art is diffferent. This is one for Criterion to get hold of and then maybe it will be all it is supposed to be. Until then, good people enjoy the story...it is an excellent early version of this time-honored tale."
2,Seems to lack the passion in a time when acting was required,I couldn't watch it all the way through and I love old films. It lacked that something to keep me interested and I have 3 other old versions that I really like. I guess I expected more because it came from a time when real acting was required but instead it seemed to just be a play with no passion. I'll have to give it another try next christmas when I haven't started a movie marathon night.
4,Cool and catchy! Four and 1/2 stars...,"This album is super cool and every single track is very strong and catchy. The female singer has a gorgeous and seductive voice and she sings with passion. If you could mix Berlin, Portishead and Depeche Mode together and add a dash of EBM, you'd get Invisible Ballet. My only complaint with the album is that they have obviously taken a little too much from some DM songs. Other than that, this CD is great and a definite keeper!"
1,Worst staged Aida ever.,"This Aida features Nina Stemme as Aida and she is very good, and the rest of cast is alright, but not great.The production, done in 19th century garb, has to be the worst coceptions of Aida ever put on stage. The opera takes place in EGYPT, not Wimpole Street. It canno be changed..the period, the style, costumes etc. Aida can be under done or over the top, but never a 19th century piece.The singers try with it, but it is so ludicrous and camp, ( see the openeing scenes with Amneris) and then, finally, distracting; you have to black out the picture and just listen.Rememeber Roger Debris in The Producers, with Zero Mostel. Roger was a director of shows that folded after the first act of the fist rehearsal. The designer of this production and all accomplices should have folded afeter the first note of the first act.And of course this is very camp, but only for a while..it will go down in history as an Aida that only primaytes could lay any claim to."
2,Save your money,"The soprano is great, but the rest of this performance is laughable. The only person missing in this production was Boris Karloff!"
5,Solid intermediate level toning for the lower body,"This is a nice short, challenging, and effective workout. I liked the variety of exercises and that there was a good blend of cardio and floorwork. I found the thigh toning section using handweights to be particularly challenging. A good intermediate level toner for the lower body. The instructor was very good, although she was a bit off of the beat on the music from time to time."
3,dull / average,"There's really nothing special about this DVD, just short toning workouts like many others with very little uniqueness.The abs workout was ok, a mix of pilates and traditional work. It was the only one I might do again.The buns workout was almost all squats.The legs workout was almost all lunges. I couldn't do any of it because it hurt my knees.The toning is done at a fast pace to keep your heartrate up. Very little is actually done on the mat. It's not a terrible workout, but there really isn't much special about it, and millions of other workouts contain lots of squats and lunges. I'm looking for something different."
3,Not a do-it-yourself book,"Had some very good ideas, but the author assumes that the reader has a lot of money and can hire an interior designer. In many instances she also suggests so. It would have been better if tailored to the DIY homeowner - after all, if you can hire an interior designer, why buy a book?"
2,Text Only,I'm looking for text and photos. This book has text alone with a few poorly drawn example of sofas and window treatments. Boring - I'd rather watch OIL paint dry than read this.
2,Basic and uninspiring,"Although there were a few cute ideas, most of the information was not helpful to me. It felt like the author was telling me to get professional help (even though I can't afford it) instead of giving me the ""secrets"" the title promised."
2,Lame,Probably the only crappy Butthole Surfers album made. I have no idea what happened. Don't waste your time unless you absolutely have to have it.
1,this is unbelievably bad,"From the opening bars you can tell (IF you have a knowledge of Wagner and this opera) that this recording is going nowhere. Absolutely no tension or suspense whatsoever, two elements required here. And even worse this set has a bigger fault of a Dutchman with no strength or personality whatsoever as well as his dry voice and swooping and scooping into notes. Morris can't sing and Levine was the worst conductor in the Met's history. This set should be avoided. Great recordings are under the batons of Krauss, Knappertsbush, & Keilberth. None others need apply."
3,No competition for Louie DeVito & Bad Boy Joe,I bought both this c.d. and Louie DeVito's Dance Factory the same day. Although they share some of the same tracks...there is absolutely NO COMPARISON! Louie DeVito's Dance Factory c.d. is SLAMMIN' ...and no doubt in large part to veteran mixer d.j. Bad Boy Joe. When those 2 team up...watch out! The energy that they unleash together is incredible! The bigger labels like Robbins just don't know what it takes to make a c.d. that really rocks. Thank god that there are talented people like Louie DeVito & Bad Boy Joe.
3,The Sequel Syndrome Strikes Again,"3 1/2 Stars = Very GoodI was disappointed in this album the first time I heard it, & didn't pick it up until several years back. It seemed like an eternity that I waited for Boston's second album, & I was mad I had to wait so long after the first, just to be let down.In retrospect, this is a very good album, not the masterpiece the first was, but how many albums are? Funny title though, ""Don't Look Back,"" for if anything this band looked back far to long at their first in making this album. What resulted was the same formula, but knocked down from 100 proof to just 75. Still, this is a good album!"
4,Don't Look Back,"Just like Boston's eponymous debut, I find myself not playing this album very often. Granted, it's not quite as good as the debut album but it's still very good, nonetheless. When I listen to this album I'm very impressed but I don't return to it very often. Is it possible because it's overly produced... might be. There's no doubt the production is good & extremely polished & therein may lie the problem; it's too polished. When I put this CD in the player it sounds great but, somehow, there seems to be a certain energy (rawness?) that's lacking. Could just be me, doc, I know."
4,A worthy follow-up,"So what DO you do after you've just establshed the record for the best-selling debut album of all time? You either make a new record, or retire. Being that the guys were still pretty young to retire, they made this altogether decent follow-up. When you sell as many albums as ""Boston"" did, you know the fans - which were numerous - would want more of the same. And Boston delivered what their fans wanted. ""Don't Look Back"" and ""Feelin' Satisfied"" are fun, rocking romps that channelled the buoyant nature of ""Peace Of Mind"" and ""Rock n Roll Band"". And Boston did progress a little bit - ""A Man I'll Never Be"" was the power ballad that didn't appear in any form on the debut album, and ""Used To Bad News"" - a personal favorite - had a slightly different style to it. All in all, Boston doesn't take any steps forward with this release, but they didn't fall backwards either."
3,"Not bad, not great though",Pretty old book. The fact that the woman is buck naked but the guy wears a jock strap should tell you how old this thing is. Much newer stuff available out there which might give you more bang for your buck.It's not horrible as the images are large and most take up the whole page.
1,"DESERVES ""O"" STAR","I can NOT belive this book. Who in their RIGHT mind would let a child be photographed NUDE? It is the most distastefull thing i have EVER seen. From the man in his jock strap and the nude woman showing it ALL. Can not belive this book is Not banned from the world and that the author is not charged with Child pornography.Nasty,Nasty book this is."
5,Love some Maxwell,"As I read in a review before I purchased this CD, you are not a true R & B fan unless you have this CD. It is mellow smooth, sensual, and puts me in the mood. I love the way this cd makes you adore yourself or help you create the mood to love someone else. I think it's true R & B soul, and I wish music was the same. Simply put, Maxwell's Urban Hang Suite is a great album you should buy it. My favorite track is Reunion. It reminds me of the times I met my beau, great conversations and gives me that feeling everytime we get back together, after a day, week, month etc. Listen to it, you'll catch my drift. Enjoy."
5,Whenever Wherever Whatever,"That song alone is worth the retail price. It brings a tear to my eye whenever I play it. Maxwell has more soul and depth in his music than all the pop-friendly superproducers combined. Like D'Angelo, Eric Benet, and Tony Rich, he's a soul man who captures the essence of the music. Also, get his Unplugged album, as well as his latest, ""Embrya""."
2,Nice background music,"Might make a nice movie soundtrack. Pretty tunes, well-orchestrated. But not an album of sea songs, per se."
5,The best glamor photography book ever.,"I've read many books on glamor photography, being a student of the art and business. John Kelly really knows his stuff. This comprehensive book is a tell-all account of how to make it in the fast-paced glamor business; from shooting to selling. A must for any photographer."
3,The Duke as an Emperor,"One must admit that Wayne is slightly miscast as the implacable Genghis Khan, but the story is not that bad. The plot is much better than the Genghis Khan movie starring Omar Sharif. This superiority probably owes to the fact that the Sharif story doesn't even attempt historical accuracy while ""The Conqueror"" seems to be loosely based on the Harold Lamb book ""Genghis Khan: Emperor of All Men."""
1,Made for MST3k...,"This film is a tragedy in more ways than one.The Duke, God blesshim, is totally out of place in the role of Kahn. From all reports, hereally threw himself into the role because he thought he could pull itoff and wanted to do a good job. Unfortunately, all of the Duke'smighty powers were not enough to make this picture gel.Not only isthe picture laughable, but it was shot on part of an atomic testingrange. Some of the radioactive soil was transported back to Hollywoodfor the soundstage shots, which didn't help matters. Many of the castand crew succumbed to cancer in later years, including the Dukehimself.Many of my fellow reviewers have noted the laughable lines,but there is one that has so far gone unmentioned, which has alwaysstuck with me:""[After her] all other women are like the secondpressing of the grape!""...or something to that effect.It'shard to believe this is on DVD when there are so many other, moreworthy films that could be transferred to the medium."
4,A fascinating account of life on a remote island,I'm so glad Margret Wittmer wrote of her experiences on Floreana. I really enjoyed reading about her and her husband building a family and a farm on this Galapagos Island. It was so unique and interesting that I believe her story will stay with me for a long time.
1,there are some repeated shows on these disc and really you 'll do better buying the complete 1st and 2nd season set,"while not bad,these same shows can be found along with all the others on the complete 1st and 2nd season set that is out there.because of this i gave this set a 1."
1,Must be a different Lawrence Block,"I am less than 1/2 way through this mess and have been sticking with it waiting for it to actually get better. I don't think it will ever get to ""good."" It reads as if Block was getting paid by the word. It goes on and on over stupid little points and descriptions. It just does not read the same as anything else I've ever read by him and I've read a BUNCH of his books. There are a couple of characters that are engaging, but he does not spend much time with them. The kindest word I can come up with for this book is ""stinks."""
5,A must-read for followers of the political scene,"Anyone who has become a fan of Jack's through his TV appearances over the past years, as have I, will thoroughly enjoy this easy-to-read account of his 40 years of covering politics. Some very interesting insights are contained therein plus some intriguing stories that will surprise some. Jack writes much like he talks - low key, matter-of-fact, no-nonsense/bottom line assessments. A great read all the way around."
5,Incredible lost treasures,"Having been a Zombies fan for 30+ years, I was amazed to discover this compilation of music from Colin Blunstone's first 3 albums. Everything from ""One Year"" is top notch, but the 3 song suite from ""Journey"" - Wonderful/Beginning/Keep the Curtains Closed Today - ranks at the top of my all-time favorite pop music. Colin's vocals on those songs are spine-tinglingly beautiful, and his soaring upper register has never sounded better. Definitely one of my favorite CDs."
3,Paul Newman's Colt Classic,"'Cool Hand Luke' was set for release in 1969, and is Paul Newman's most well known film. The film was directed by Stuart Rosenberg, and has a supurb soundtrack by Lalo Schifrin. Once you have watched this film it will always be in your mind, with numerous classic scenes and great one liners.Simply indulge yourself..."
4,"It's a classic, but it's depressing.","This movie is a classic, but it is depressing. You won't be laughing your socks off. So, even though it's a classic, it turns out to be pointless. It won't help you along the road in life."
4,Classic American cinema,"A terrific film that gets better with age. There's not a false note or misstep in this movie. It becomes more relevant and rewarding as the years go by, and it's earned it's status as a classic American movie.So why did I mark this down one star? This film deserves the DVD Special Edition treatment and all we have here is the film and a few brief production notes. This is one of Warners first releases in the DVD format and it's well overdue for a deluxe re-release with interviews, commentary, relevant documentaries and perhaps the screenplay. It's a crime that films like Road Trip get the deluxe treatment and worthy films like this miss out.Still, this is an okay transfer and the mono sound is clear enough. If you love this film, you won't let the lack of features stop you from making a purchase anyway."
5,the legend,"i have watched this movie over 400 times,will never be another newman,blu-ray is crystal clear"
5,Great movie...,"Great American classic, I have loved this movie for a long time and blu-ray only makes it better. One of Paul Newman's best roles."
5,One hell of a good movie!,"This is probably one of my favorite movies. The main story in 'Reindeer Games' is that an excon, Rudy Duncan (affleck) poses as his jailmate in order to meet his pen pal Ashley (theron). Then her brother, thinking that affleck is really the jailmate, forces him at gunpoint to help him rob a casino. This movie was more than what I had expected in all the right categories. Nonstop action meets tingling suspense and even some humor. Rent this movie... I garantee that you will love it just as I did. I will definately be buying this one when it comes out on VHS. I LOVE IT!"
1,Could this movie be anymore obvious?,"This movie should be in the comedy section, because I found myself laughing at it more than being thrilled at it. The characters are just plain stupid, mostly Gary Sinese (whenever I see him with long hair I always think of him without legs...not a very threatening villian I must say). The plot twists are obvious, and stupid. Bad acting, bad script, BAD MOVIE!!!"
2,Violence--with a twist,"This movie seems to have an identity crisis. One minute it's a blood-and-guts, shoot-em-up violent movie and the next minute it tries to be funny and tongue-in-cheek. Ben Affleck is hard to believe as a newly-released convict who assumes his dead cellmate's identity and the lady penpal who is waiting for his release. He wants only to go home, drink hot chocolate, and watch football games with his father, but alas, he becomes involved with some bad guys who think he really is the man he is impersonating. There is lots of shooting, beatings, and violence, but through it all, Ben maintains his sense of humor. The only thing that saves this movie (the actors are hindered by a bad script) are the twists and turns of the plot at the end which keep it from being a 1-star attraction."
4,Under rated,"I don't understand the bad reviews this movie is getting. It does not have bad acting just because Ben Affleck is in it. It certainly is worth your time compared to most other action movies out there, in particular the highest hyped (ex. Mission Impossible 2). I feel sorry for the simple Amish folk who got confused by the plot. It's something original for a change in a sea of recycled movies."
4,"Good movie, needs more tho...","Its one of those movies, that you get hyped up on and you go up and down on during the movie, with the hype, if you havent seen it already watch it for the first time, its good...but after you've seen it more than once, everything falls in its own place, if this sounds good to you... pick it up.. its a 4 out of 5 in my book... well for first timers anyways then id say a 3 for the people who watch movies over and over like myself."
2,Reindeer Games - Please don't let me see this again,"This movie was just terrible. The acting is the worst that I have seen out of all of the actors. It's not because they are bad actors, it is because they were given such terrible dialogue to work with. Ben Affleck's character didn't know whether to be tough or scared. It was just so up and down, that it seemed like he was playing two characters. A wimp and a tough guy. It didn't make sense. The only reason that I gave the movie 2 instead of one stars is because it had a little surprise at the end that I didn't expect. Other than that, it was a complete waste of time. I wouldn't even advise renting it, let alone buying it."
1,SUPERstupid.,"This is one of the worst films of its time. I cannot believe Ben Affleck, Gary Sinise, and Charlize Theron have this stinker on their resumes.... it must be an embarrassment for all three of them. The plot is completely implausible from the word go, Affleck's character has about a billion things he could do to escape that we're supposed to believe just never cross his mind, the plot twists are NOT clever (just stupid), there are gun mistakes in the film (guy firing with Uzi, the scene cuts away from him for a second, then cuts back to him and now he has a Mac-10, crap like that), and if you actually make it all the way to the end of the film (I wish to God I hadn't), the ending is so stupid you're like ""I cannot believe I suffered through this entire piece of crap for THAT."" Skip it...... trust me."
1,Horrible Messages,"In the book, Hannah Coulter, Wendell Berry talks about how people need to say that they're fine, even when their husbands have died in war and about how Hannah understood that her future husband visited a brothel because he needed to. The second point of view is as wretched and evil as possible. Everyone needs to be aware of the despair and disease that such places breed and fight to get rid of them. The first encourages a falseness in relationships. I would give no stars if I could."
3,OK,"I had to read this for a college course. It was kind of interesting, but I wouldn't read it unless I had to."
5,Like a novelized poem,I don't always agree with Berry. Sometimes I agree with his dianoses but wonder what practical solution there is for the problems he notices. But one thing I must say is that he is able to beautifully capture the pathos and wonder of human community. Quite simply this is a beautiful meditation on life and relationship. If you do not come away longing for or at least pondering community and what it means you may want to check you pulse. His descriptions of married life are sublime.A few random questions I have as I read the Port William novels:-What would happen if an Italian immigrant moved to Port William? Would they be welcome?-What is evil? Would you ever want to just kick someone out because they were so bad?-Should I just let the effect of the novel wash over me or should I respond to a larger message?
1,bad bad bad,"unless you weigh 300 lbs and 6.5 feet tall, this will be too big. it is made of poor construction, bad stitching, and junk material. DON'T BUY. I had to buy it for a Mardi Gras thing. We were going to wear them again and again, but they aren't good, no one liked them and we threw them away after just one year. What a waste of money!"
1,Only buy if...,"If you own ""Scooby-Doo, Where Are You Seasons 1-2"" and ""The Best of The New Scooby-Doo Movies"" then this purchase is a waste of money. This is more of a best of collection for those who don't have any of the video's. These are some great episodes and I am a huge Scooby-Doo fan for 40+ years, but I thought the buyer should be aware before making a wasted purchase if trying to fill in their collection."
2,WHAT ARE WE BUYING????????,"The last review helped 0 people because the author never tells what movies are included. If anyone out there is selling this, please tell us what movies are included. We don't want to buy this only to find we already have it. I only give it 2 stars because all we know is that it is Scooby-Doo."
2,More fluff than substance.,This book on tape has so little actual content that they had to invent a parlor game (a weak one at that) to fill out enough tape to keep the cassette from floating away. The total real content contained could fit on the back of a business sized envelope with room enough left over for another Gettysburg address.
3,Have fun doing the quiz!,"I didn't understand the strange kind of humor of the author and his team A, B and C, but I enjoyed the Imponderables. If you're the person asking questions like ""why is the color of the sky blue?"" (although this one isn't answered in this book), you'll have fun doing the quiz. Unfortunately this tape was toooooo short."
4,Pretty!,"This is a very pretty bassinet skirt and hood. I like it very much. It fits beautifully. HOWEVER, there is nothing embossed OR damask about it. The description is misleading. It is simply a white cotton skirt and liner with a stretchy smocking that enables the skirt to fit so well. The bow is velcro'd onto the front of the skirt and hangs loosely which looks very tacky. I will be sewing it on permanently so that it stays straight. Overall I am happy with it. But I believe the description should be rewritten."
3,Picture is incorrect,"Although this skirt fits my bassinet, I am disappointed, as the fabric is not ""embossed."" It is a plain, cotton fabric. The picture is incorrect, this style is not available from aBaby.com"
3,Not Bad,"Although this series was not bad, being as it was a Web based series, I am still waiting for the greatest series in the MK universe ever made to be released on Blu Ray. That's right. I am talking about 1998's Mortal Kombat: Conquest, with Kristanna Loken and Tracy Douglas (and I guess there were some guys in it also)."
2,Mortal Disappointment,"This production has been ruined by FILTHY language. Totally unnecessary and small minded detractions from what could have been good dialogue. The good special effects and skill of the actors do not come close to compensating for the language, which reminds me of a poorly-done B movie."
4,Like it... now give us more!,"My understanding here is that the ""trailer"" that was released on the internet a couple years back was to be used as a showcase, sort of a ""look what we could do..."" for a studio. That clip was a hit with the fans, and now we have this awesome addition to the MK universe. All the classics and favorites with a nice twist (the Raiden short was great!), almost as a gift for the fans who'd love to see more. And we would, very much so. There's a lot of potential here for someone to come along and take these characters and their world seriously, as shown in this series of ""webisodes"". Sure, you can watch 'em free online if you want... but I had to have it on my shelf. I'm very tactile like that."
2,"Mostly boring. Of all the episodes, I only like the 3 of them.","Mostly boring. Of all the episodes, I only liked 3 of them. The Scorpion and Sub Zero episodes were pretty good. The Cyrax and Sektor episode was OK. The rest were garbage.The episode about Raiden was complete bull. In the episode, Raiden is captured by security guards at a mental hospital. Seriously, the god of thunder can be beaten up by security guards??? This episode just made me mad. I wish I could sue the maker for my pain and suffering.I only paid $8 for the Blu-Ray. I feel sorry for anyone that paid more."
5,Unglaublich!,"Definitely my favourite Megaherz work to date, Herwerk II blends everything i truly love about intelligent, hard-hitting metal into one nifty little package. With less emphasis on electronics, the band has further evolved their style, lending more to an energetic, wholesome rock sound. The texts are meaningful and unrestrained and powerfully presented by Alexx. X-ti's guitar work shines like never before, blasting aside all expectations. Favourite songs: Glas und Tränen, 5. März, Perfekte Droge, Herzblut."
2,A little unoriginal,"Basically, this release is produced well but isn't particularly unique in the song writing department. Sort of sounds like a Rammstein/Faith No More hybrid passed through a Nu-metal filter. The popular songs from this album have their moments but don't really stand out as entities in and of themselves. Space filling strumming seems to be used when they are running out of ideas or want to lengthen a song to an unnatural point, you often feel you know the song in another form. Though a completely different style it imparts the same feeling to the fan as Tool's ""Lateralus"", unsatisfying there appears to be something missing just beyond your grasp which the more raw earlier works achieve. Most bands seem to head this way though"
1,Horrible shielding,"I got the 5 meter cable to run to my new 4 channel amp. The sound quality is awesome so long as I don't have and power going to my brake lights or turn signal. The cable is several inches from the power for the blinker, but the moment I go to make a turn my music goes completely static in time with the flashing. I cant route the cable any further from the blinker cord than it already is so I am stuck until I can get another cable. No more Monster multichannel cables for me."
2,To be avoided,"As ""Coppelia"" videos are rather difficult to find, I ordered this one and was sorely disappointed! Sets and costumes are paltry, the dancing is second-rate and the ""corps de ballet"" is anything but a unified group. The audience is quite noisy, screaming their approval - in Spanish - everytime Mr. Bujones leaps or turns. The coreography has been mutilated to adapt to the very small talents of both the leading lady and the soloists. Mr. Bujones'efforts are not enough to justify the purchase of this lamentable affair.So sorry!"
2,disappointed,"I expected more from this book . It has some interesting hints but I found it rather shallow , almost self help."
1,The editor should be fired!!!!,I purchased this book due to the author and the reviews it received. What a disappointment. The only reason I finished it was because I didn't want to just throw it out. Let me tell you - I should have just tossed it in the garbage!Don't waste your time or money on this book.
5,A MUST BUY,"If you need to know accurate information on suppliments this book is a MUST. It is so wonderful to read something that I can turn into immediate physical improvements. No false promises, product loyalties..JUST THE FACTS! Thank You Dr.s Antonio and Stout!"
4,Great start to the day,"I love this. It's not too difficult, but plenty challanging. The steps are well explained, and the timing is good.I'm big, and the positions chosen are easy to get into, and comfortable to maintain. One of the best features of this dvd is a section that shows you alternate positions if you can't get into a certain pose.My one complaint is that the speaker does not formally begin or end the session. This is especially noticable at the end where you transition into relaxation and then.... nothing. the credits just roll. For people who have used other yoga tapes, or been to classes, it's disconcerting.However it's a great yoga dvd for ""the rest of us"""
5,Just for me,I have many different exercise dvd's but this is one that after the first time I can't wait to do it tomorrow. I got the dvd today.(fast shipping) My 19 year old daughter who has been doing yoga since she went off to college and I did it together. Eventhough I know it was easy for her she enjoyed the gentle flowing workout. I enjoyed that for a true beginner I was not intimidated by the poses and I felt a great sense of accomplishment for being able to do it. I felt relaxed when it was over. I think I will get a copy for my daughter and her room mate who is a larger person like me. Great dvd
4,Yoga for everyone else,I like the fact that the yoga is for anyone. She does a good job of modifying the yoga for people who can't get into some of the poses and does a good job of taking her time and doing the poses so that you can learn how to do them well. She is fit and flexible but she is not a skinny rail and that makes it much more comfortable following her. A good mix of strength and streching poses. This is a good fit for me.
3,Skip This One,"This DVD is visually very pleasing and the presenter's voice is very pleasant. I've taken yoga classes from a plus-size teacher who was very good at showing the class how to modify poses for a larger body, and I was disappointed that this DVD contained absolutely none of that content. If I were a beginner, I would have found the unhurried pace reassuring, but Megan Garcia doesn't explain any of the movements at all so beginners I'm sure would be lost. For someone with a little yoga experience, though, the pace is a little too slow and basic. At the end she puts all of the moves together so they flow into each other, which would be too hard for a beginner and still not very challenging to non-beginners."
1,Week,"Very week, not good at all. It is almost static, no movement at all.I do not recommend it.Sandra"
5,megan garcia,"I love this product, Megan is so helpful and I feel that I can really relate to her as a plus size woman. I will check for more products from her. I also have her book."
4,"Loved it, but wanted more","Her method and way of teaching is great. I'm a big fan of her book, Mega Yoga, and I picked this up because of the great reviews. After working with the book for as long as I have, this is pretty much the ""quickie"" workout version. After doing it, watching her, following her lead (which is absent in books) with the music, I learned to pace myself better than I was, and I felt super relaxed afterwards. It was a great augment to what I've already learned, and my normal routine. My only complaint is that I want more! I want the entire routine, all the moves! I want to be really worked over, and tired.All in all, it's great, makes you feel good, tranquil, stretched, and like you've really accomplished something in that half hour."
2,Not as bad as The Breaking Point...,"But if anyone asked me what these stories were about I would not be able to tell them. I remember the titles and some of the details but not the stories. Way over my head. And I am a pretty well-read person so it's not that I'm just not a reader. I wouldn't recommend this really highly because her novels are so much better. Try The King's General, The House on the Strand."
1,You get what you pay for,"Unless you want garbage quality pictures and a battery life that's not even long enough to fill up the memory, do not buy this camera."
4,A little better than what you pay for,"This is the kind of camera you'd want to put on your keychain - and not worry if it gets damaged. It's about like buying a disposable camera, the ones with the film fixed in them - it will get you by until you get the real thing. Just don't expect too much out of it."
3,it rocks but,it sounds very Bassie. I had to turn my bass way down to get a half way decide sound out of this Cd. Rods in a great mood and the vibe at this show is amazing.If you loved rod when he rocked in the early to mid 70s this is for you disspite the week recording.
5,wonderful,"Another great recording by this artist. The music is talented and wonderful, the lyrics truly respectful and mean so much. If you are a Jesus follower, you will enjoy this, as you will anything this artist has done for the Lord"
4,Not What I Expected,"For those searching to learn more about the Orthodox Faith, I do recommend the book. However, I was expecting it to be more along the lines of why not how. Just know that the book is not about the beliefs and practices of the Orthodox, but about how the writers of the stories came in to contact with the Church and their journeys to join it."
4,An Eye-Opener,"This CD is great for the Beach Boys fan that is interested in exploring some of their ""other"" classics. Of course, there are the masterpieces like Good Vibrations, California Girls et al, but the true gems of this CD are the lesser known yet equally as masterful b-sides and ""deep-dish"" songs like ""Til I Die"", ""Marcella"", ""Time to Get Alone"" and ""Sail on Sailor"". The compliation dutifully displays that despite their lack of chart success post Good Vibrations, the Beach Boys and Brian Wilson didn't stop producing hits after the ill-fated ""SMILE"" project was shelved in 1967. The discovery of these songs helps to shed light on the lesser-known albums from which they came and in turn opens up the Beach Boys late-1960's early 1970's catalog to a whole new generation of fans. Don't miss this collection of classics, and use this compliation as a spring board to explore the 1967-1973 period of the BB catalog."
2,Making a complicated subject almost inaccessible,"This edition is riddled with typographical errors and general computational mistakes. Though some of this text's lack of clarity is due to the subject matter itself, it certainly isn't carefully-edited enough to make it more understandable. Very little is given by way of explanation, and solutions to the many problems in the text are given sparsely. The only positive thing I can say is that the problems in the text are generally appropriate for the material, but as an introduction to the subject, this text leaves you basically on your own."
4,Excellent Movie,Not much to be said. For there only being 2 main characters in this movie (and it being some-what low budget) it was a great movie.
4,Great workout!,"This is a great workout for beginnners and slightly advanced as you can increase the weights as needed. There is not very much cardio, but i prefer this as i am not into alot of different steps to learn-it is enough that i am trying to workout on a regular basis never mind learning to dance too!! Over all when i am done i feel like i have accomplished what i wanted to and that is what is important!"
5,Maximum Body Shaping: Best Firm Ever,"I have been using workout videos from The Firm for a few years, but this one is my absolute favorite. Tracie Long is a great leader. The moves are complex and transitions are fast, but when you do a video many times that is what keeps things interesting. She explains the proper form and illustrates the wrong way to do the moves which is very helpful. The video is not so hard that I feel like collapsing halfway through (and some of the Firm videos ARE that hard), but it gets my heart going every time and afterwards I feel energized. A great total-body workout that I actually look forward to. Highly recommended!"
3,Not bad,"I enjoy incorporating art into the core curricular content areas, so I bought this book toward that end. I found several good ideas, but it wasn't as inspiring as I'd hoped. I'm really not sure I'm further ahead with this book than I would be with an internet search. It's definitely useful, but if I could do it all over again, I'd probably choose differently."
4,Concentrates on beaded purses,"Start at the cover of this book that features five necklaces. You'll say, ""Wow! How can I make these gorgeous little necklace purses?"" Author Enid Taylor shows you how. Bead stitching is pretty much the same from book to book, offering the same techniques shown here: brick, square, peyote, and netting stitches. This book is special because Enid shows you how those stitches combine to make a fabulous purse. Enid, a home economics teacher for 24 years, started a craft studio in 1982, so there's lots of teaching experience behind her book. Although her craft studio's focus was on lacemaking, spinning, and needlework, her expertise in beading shines through. Not only are there many techniques shown for the body of the purses, but there are multiple ways shown to make the neckchains and fanciful decorative finishes. If your aim is to concentrate your efforts on amulet necklaces, this is the book for you!"
1,Not comfortable at all and non-returnable!,"Had such high hopes for this with all the reviews but so disappointed! If you have skinny arms - like anorexic - probably work well for you. This was very tight in the arm area. Not adjustable easily... PLUS it makes your hand/wrist so HOT! Not breathable at all. SO, SO DISAPPOINTED. Top it off and find out that it is NOT returnable! It doesn't clearly say that in the product information anywhere! IF something has a unique return policy, I think it should be noted in the product description! I ordered 2-3 different ones and this was the ONLY one that was unreturnable! Luckily found one that was fantastic BUT if I had known, I would NEVER have ordered this to try it!"
5,Haters - Caint live with 'em...............,"for all those who dislike the ""gospel rappers"", dont hate. the gospel gangstaz is a nice touch to the woody rock cd. the vocals on the song he did with marymary are especially tight. jus goes to show wat God can do and who/what he'll use/do to get the message of his love across."
4,This is about the most proven effective workout there is!,"I had to laugh, grimace is more like it, at the recent reviewer who was so disgusted by the ""horrible running"" and the ""lightening speed"" sculpting moves. Who even knows if this person is in shape, that she is such an expert? Thousands and thousands of people did (and still do, I'm sure) this workout and they got into fabulous shape! One of the best things about these older but tough workouts is that they don't use weights when working on the obliques. Notice the women in the early Firms aren't shaped like blocks, they have waistlines. Why would you want to build up muscles at your waist, it doesn't make the fat go away you know. And what is wrong with a little running?"
2,Where's the DVD version?,I love this volume of The Firm. I had to return it because my VHS machine stopped working. Has anyone seen a DVD version of this volume?
4,Learned A Huge Amount From This Workout,"I got The Firm: Total Body - Body Sculpting Basics VHS years ago. Even though I haven't viewed it for years, I use what I learned from it every time I pick up weights. My exercise is more effective and productive because of what I learned from this workout.I decided to go back through it again today as a review. I have a home gym full of exercise machines, but this video takes it up a level. What a workout!I just ordered the DVD version of it since I just discovered that there is one."
4,A Classic That Doesn't Let Up!,"This video may be 20 years old, but it stands the test of time. If you can get past the dated clothes and music, you have in your hands an excellent workout that will challenge you for years to come. The routine has a mix of cardio, weights and floor work. In my opinion the floor work is the most challenging-- I hit muscle failure many times today. Susan Harris, the instructor, frequently mentions going at your own pace, and I think this is the key. Use weights if you can. Do as many reps as you can. This will not only give you goals to work toward but allow to you see progress over time. If you're looking for a cardio-heavy, total low impact workout, this is not the tape for you. However, if you can handle a little jogging in place and want to really challenge your muscles, give this one a try. The Firm video series has flourished for 2 decades, and this video is one reason why!"
5,Great Workout.,"If you're looking to lose weight fast, and tone up your body, look no more. This workout will help you gain muscle and lose fat fast.Susan Harris is a Great instructor! It never gets boring."
4,A REAL BLAST,"Susan Harris has been working really hard, you could tell. I am an advanced exerciser and I jog every morning for 4 miles. In addition to my routine, I have been doing the tape for two months, and I relly feel that I am working out. The thigh and butt parts are not easy, even for joggers like me. The only drawback is that the bacground appears very out and old, also the costumes and Susan Harris' make-up. I gathered from another fitness website that the tape was actually made in 1985 and I guess this is a re-issue in 1995. I also think that Susan Harris is too soft in cueing. SHe could have better motivated fellow exercisers. Another thing is that why is every one in the background working so perfectly? That makes the tape a bit unreal."
3,doesnt fit a regular size ottoman,"My ottoman is regular size, nothing oversized about it. This didn't fit. I got the whole set of these and I am happy with the quality of the item. This is mismarked as large."
3,Not worth reading,"To be completely honest, I'm not quite sure what to say about this book. I came in with no preconceptions whatsoever. I had never heard of Michael Grant at all, much less this specific book. I simply happened to come across it while looking for some new reading material in my local library and decided to give it a read. It had amazing and insightful high points but when there were low points they were very, very low. Unfortunately for my review, this boils down and averages out to mediocre. Michael Grant spends much of the book simultaneously chastising his fellow historians for creating a ""Jesus"" of their own making, painting him whichever way most happens to appeal to each personally, all while doing so himself. (I don't want to spoil the book for anyone, but to summarize: Michael Grant's ""Jesus"" seems to be an obsessive with some very strange personality quirks.) My final take: the insights can be found elsewhere, while the low points are Grant's own babies; skip this book."
4,Pet Little Stinker Heavy-Duty Poop Scoop,"I have not used it very much yet. It is strong. Pay attention to the size, It is small, But will do. I have a Jack Russel, A meddle size dog, It will do the job, I would have liked it better if it was a little bigger. I would like to say, Amazon is the 1st. place I look on line when I need something. Thank You Amazon. Keep up the good work for all of us."
5,Worth the cost,My husband and I are very impressed with how very well made this is and how it cleans ups so very nicely. The adjustable handle also makes it perfect for both my husband and I to use.We like our so much we're thinking of getting a couple more so we can leave this one in the garage and then have one to leave in the car with baggies for road trips and one in the house for indoor accidents.
2,Still Searching for That Perfect Exercise Video!!!!,"I recently and eagerly purchased this exercise video after reading the other reviews here. While it is a very thorough work-out, most of the time for me it was difficult to follow (I am a klutz!)the quick-changing steps of many of the routines. Also, it was NOT easy on my knees, ankles, or shins with all the pliometric jumping and all the running in place. I am in my mid 40's and in relatively decent shape; maybe if I were 15 years younger!! I did feel thoroughly challenged in regards to endurance and coordination!! Probably a tape better suited for very advanced, well-coordinated folks. I would definitely NOT recommend it to people with knee, ankle, or shin problems."
5,"As good as Sly gets, which is better than everyone else.","His first, and along with ""Stand"", his best. Full of the energy and innovation that made him the best that there was back in '68.Buy it for ""Dance to the Medley"": Dance In, Music Lover an Music is Alive. Fifteen minutes of the best there was."
4,Time saver and ensures gauge is accurate,"Works perfectly with this:www.amazon.com/Presto-01781-23-Quart-Pressure-Canner/dp/B0000BYCFU/Has two rings (each add 5 PSI). So you have 5, 10, and 15PSI.Tip for using / saving energy:e.g. Canning recipe requires 10PSI.Put on one ring (10PSI) and turn on high. Come back when it is rocking and it will be at 10PSI. Put on another ring (15PSI) and drop the heat to medium or med-low. If I didn't do this, I would have to leave the pressure cooker on high the entire time."
5,a little extra insurance,"Many reviews on the internet tell you that the gauge on the Presto pressure canner can become inaccurate over time. This will gently rock at 5, 10, or 15 lbs pressure allowing you to see if your gauge is reading correctly, or needs calibration. Better safe than sick from improperly canned food. Also, this will allow the canner to be used as a regular pressure cooker."
4,A lighthearted space adventure,"Williams and Dix do a superb job with the opening book to their Evergence trilogy. This story involves Morgan Roche, an intelligence operative for the Commonwealth of Empires, a sort of conglomeration of solar systems that agree to have the same government. Roche's mission is to escort a super-AI known as the Box to Commonwealth Intelligence HQ. Everything begins to go wrong, however, when the ship she is on (the Midnight) is ambushed by Dato Bloc (another government) forces.Roche, with the help of the Box, bucks the odds by surviving the attack and escaping the Midnight in a small pod. Along the way, she enlists the help of Adoni Cane, a seemingly normal human with some very superhuman capabilities. While her ""partners"" all seem very willing to help, several strange facts come to the forefront, and Morgan begins to wonder what her ""friends"" might secretly think. Who, really, is Adoni Cane? And what does the Box really want? Read the book and find out!"
4,It beats the rest,"In the Company of Giants offers one of the freshest treatment today's ""Robber Barons"" and manages to do it without bogging the reader down in technical minutae. I found this book to provide frank insight into how these executives achieved the success they did and what aspect of technology is likely to yield fruit in the future. The personal stories from these giants are what make the book"
4,Will stop the deer,Stopped the deer at its track - only problem I had with the product is it is sometimes hard to work with and when you staple it the material sometimes breaks. But at least my bushes have not been eaten to the bone.
4,A GREAT book,"Isabel: Taking Wing is a VERY good book. It tells about her life as a twelve-year-old in England in 1592. She becomes friends with Meg, a servant girl. But when she an Meg go to a theater alone, they end up staying too long, and they steal a boat that almost sinks. When Isabel returns home very late, her strict aunt tells her father what she's done, and she's sent away to her Aunt de Vere's country estate. When she finally returns home, her father forgives her after she saves her baby sister from dying. The only bad part in this book is when Meg dies from the plauge. This is a fantastic book."
5,great book about the details behind the movie,This book is an excellent complement to the movie as it goes into more details than covered in the movie. Lovell does an excellent job of writing the story in the third person and covering all the characters and events in detail.
5,Love this book!,This detailed account written by the person involved is amazing. I love the little details and facts included. It is so incredible that they survived this event. The number of men (no women to my knowledge) who worked together to bring them back to Earth. I love the teamwork and the physics and math involved. This is a wonderful book. I highly recommend it.
2,"It had lots of info, but it was really Lovell's biography.","I am a sixth-grade student writing a research paper on Apollo 13, and I used your book as one of my sources. It was a very fact-filled book, but I thought it seemed more like Jim Lovell's biography. There was too much trivial information on Jim Lovell's young life and the Apollo 1 mission in which Gus Grissom, Ed White, and Roger Chafee were killed. What I was looking for was a comprehensible book about Apollo 13, and Apollo 13 only, not a book with half of it on what happened to Jim Lovell before he ever went on Apollo 13. I'm sorry if I sound offensive, because Ron Howard did make a very successful movie based on it, but if you don't think I ever give good comments, read my input for the Apollo 13 book ""Moon Shot"", by Alan Shepard and Deke Slayton, which I rated 5 stars."
5,"Good, true, thrilling book","This has got to be one of the best true stories I have ever read. Lovell and Kluger know how to write a story. This book has lots of technical detail, but not too much. 100% good reading."
5,GREAT CD!,"After reading the review of ""careroevil"" for this CD, I've got to go and get some of Ms. Tedeschi's earlier CD's...I love this one."
4,Great Stuff,"One of those albums I keep coming back to. Not all songs are great, but most are. Well worth buying."
5,"I hate waiting, but I LOVE this record!","After four years it was about time for a new Susan Tedeschi record, and this one proves well worth the wait. The lead track, ""Alone"", is a gem! It sounds like your favorite Al Green tune that you never heard. Her voice is supple and covers a much wider and deeper range than on her first album, Just Won't Burn. Susan's husband Derek Trucks kicks in some burning slide guitar on two cuts. The title track is a classic blues torch song. The sound of the album is clean and shows off Susan's gorgeous voice without a bunch of needless gloss. This record should get her some of the respect that she deserves."
5,FEAR!!!,You should FEAR not having this game! This is the best FPS I've played in YEARS. This expansion was kind of short IMO but well worth the buy. Can't wait for more. FAR les bad language in this expansion. The main game went overboard and I'm not easily offended by language.
2,bad video quality,"I have the same issue as the previous reviewer -- the content of the video is great, as always with the Firm. However, the video quality is really bad. The audio was really low. My previous Firm tapes, which I have used over and over again, have much higher audio and video quality."
1,very bad video quality,"The work out is great but the quality of the video is so bad I don't want to put it back in my new vcr.Goodtimes entertainment, who is now making the firm videos sure knows how to cut corners to save a buck. It's a real shame, because the Firm is really the best workout on the market."
3,It's ok.,"A group of friends go check out a cave in India before one of them gets married. Unfortunatly, they get trapped inside with a giant killer centipede. The bad writing, acting, and special effects might put you off, but there's still a little bit of fun to be had with this one. Rent it if you really want to see it."
3,Good workout but kind of reptetive,"I use this tape 2 to 3 times a week for the past 2 weeks and i gotta admit it can be struggling to get through. There are just so many lat rows. Its definitely the feature of this workout. Not enough bicep work at all. I have to suuplement with my own bicep work.All in all though, it is a good workout and it leaves my arms shaking and burning. I will have to write another review in a few months to let you know my progress or mainly, how big my upper back has gotten from all these lat rows LOL"
4,Larry Raspberry And The Highsteppers - No Accident,"Songs Include :""Older Woman""""Betty""""Hard Way Out""""Ain't Enough Of Your Love""""I'm Gonna Forgive You Again""""Where Did You Leave Your Love Tonight""""Please Forgive A Fool ( Song For Missy )""""When It Comes To Lovin' Your A Real Encyclopedia""""It Can't Be Done"""
2,"Very Disappointing - Great Idea, Lousy Execution","Great Idea - assemble skeleton, assemble mold around it, fill mold. Targeted as easy enough for 6+ years, this toy has great potential. But none of it is met. I have successfully assembled hot-wheels loop-de-loop Shark Parks and 200+ piece lego ships; and my husband is a mechanic and can rebuild engines blind-folded. We were unable to do this project, nevermind a 6 year old. The skeleton's final assembly is precarious due to poorly engineered nub-slot mating. The finished skeleton's posture doesn't match the mold, so putting the mold on knocks bones off. Once the mold assembly is begun, the mold sub-parts don't stay together. Would dissuade anyone considering the purchase, and would not buy anything else from manufacturer."
1,An hour of my life I can't get back,"This is the worst toy ever. I am a scientist and I couldn't even get through the first part (assembling the skeleton). The parts are so poorly made that when you push to get one part on, another will fall off. After an hour, I passed the job to my husband (my five year old had completely lost interest in watching me struggle and swear) who spent an hour trying to get the skeleton into the mold. Once he got the skeleton together and put it in the mold, any manipulation of the 80 tiny plastic mold parts would break the skeleton again. I shudder to think what the process is for filling in the body - I probably would have ruined my kitchen in the process.This is going back. Don't waste even a dollar on this piece of junk."
4,GREAT WITH GLUE,"This toy is GREAT if you add a little glue : ) We tried it without any glue and became frustrated quickly, but just a little dab of glue on the pieces helped us to create 2 really cool looking dinosaurs!!! I would reccommend this for ages 8 and up due to the complexity of the skeleton, but putting the dinosaur ""puzzle"" together was half the fun!!"
4,Wash your hands!!!,"This was a Christmas gift for our 7 yr old son. He was very excited about it. In theory, it's very cool thing. You get to build the skeleton and prepare the mold. We did the t-rex first. First off, we couldn't get all the gel into the mold so he came out with lots of bone showing. Second, for the love of GOD, wash your hands after handling the dinosaur!!!! My son and I have a bad habit of biting our nails and were gagging at the taste!!! Awful!!! I can't imagine what toxic stuff must be in there to taste so badly."
1,Aweful,"This product is aweful, the skin does not cover the bones, my nephew loved it but as a consumer don't buy it, it's a great idea and concept, but needs adjusting."
5,Bayou Classic Wing Rack,"These are awesome. We bought these for our sons. They love to cook out a lot. They love them and we have used ours in the oven. They cook evenly and keep the meat juicy! If you like to cook wings, this the only way to go!"
1,Just got it and it's broken,This rack is poorly made. Just arrived and it's already broken. The frame is really thin and the welds holding it together are just tacks that are poorly done. One of the welds didn't hold at all. Pretty disappointed. Not sure how long the other welds will hold out in the heat.
4,Wish there was more there.,"I love almost every song on this album - not as wild about ""Mary Lynn"", but I like that Michael Penn dares to be different and challenge the listener and who knows, that song could eventually become my favorite. I have enjoyed all of Penn's work and feel that he's grown musically over time and this album may be his best work yet. I only wish there were more songs, this is the same way I felt about MP4, it just wasn't long enough. But I'll definitely take what I can get!"
4,"Good look into a misunderstood world, if not a little outdated","I read this book when I was preparing for the academy myself. It was a wonderful eye-opener that I think should be required reading for anyone wanting to pin on the badge. Some of the lessons are a little dated since Wambaugh wrote this about the civil rights era, but can still be applied in the modern world. Just to warn people out there: this is not the happy, adventure book that some may be looking for. This is about as real as it comes!"
1,Watch the expiration date,"When you purchase this product, you'll notice that you are actually purchasing it from a distributor, in my case, Vitamin Shoppe. When the order arrived, the product was outdated. When I contacted Vitamin Shoppe, they responded immediately, but sent a replacement product that was also outdated. Bad, bad customer service. Beware."
3,Very good for a boat shopper,I was looking for a little more detail in the standard maintenance category but it does a really good job of telling buyers/owners what to look for in the wear and tear areas. It's a good add to a small collection of help books on boating.
5,What a buy!,"Although a sailing novice, I recognize this as an excellent reference. Actually 4 books in 1 with excellent information to help you evaluate a used boat and maintain it. We used it to successfully evaluate the boat we bought. The writing style is clear, but casual -- not dry like some. Great illustrations. A special section on diesel engines is included written by an expert in the field. I was really thrilled with the section on items that you can make for your boat, from pockets, to sail bags, covers, and even biminis. It has become my favorite book and will be invaluable in refinishing my boat's teak and getting the inside neatly organized. Can't wait to get started!"
4,Zurg is a BAD GUY,"As the parent of a 3 year old who LOVES all things Buzz Lightyear, this toy was inevitable. It is sturdy, with a nurf-style gun. You pump zurg's head to shoot the gun. But it only shoots from one of the barrels and you have to physically move the next nurf pellet to the firing barrel. An automatic firing mechanism would be cooler. With any luck, all of the pellets will be lost in a short time & we won't have to keep yelling ""Stop shooting at your brother!"""
5,Exactly what I expected,"Great book and loaded with good info as with all Gary Null's books. Despite delays with the mail service during the holidays, the sender made a fantastic effort to make sure the product was received in good form. I'm very pleased."
5,Pet Care book,"I love this book written by Gary Null. Before going to the Vet I look up the conditions or symptoms for my cat. He has wonderful ideas, facts and even lists where to get the herbs he recommends. I would highly recommend this book to others. It is a lifesaver and saves me money by not having to go to a Vet. Sometimes I still take my cat to the doctor to get a diagnoses so I can then look up in the book for the best herb or natural remedy to administer to my cats. Great book."
4,Terrific performances.,"Maybe you've forgotten that Robert DeNiro was once considered America's best actor. Maybe his constant involvement these days in lousy projects (Showtime, Rocky and Bullwinkle, Hide and Seek, et al) has diminished his reputation? Well, Stanley & Iris is a terrific place to go to see him at his guarded, emotionally tight best.This is a middle-aged love story, about two people whose lives have been difficult, and who need each other more than they know.While the direction and story are somewhat weak, the characters of Stanley and Iris and DeNiro and Fonda's performances make the film.Here you will find excellent acting, genuine vulnerability and and angle of repose and beauty."

5,But ...,"I am a self confessed 'Geezer'. While I spent my early life as an Air Force jet fighter pilot, my vision is not what it once was. This is a really nice watch, but its various features are somewhat complicated. I would say that anyone who buys this watch MUST read the instructions to get things working. Herein lies the rub.The instruction booklet is made up of about .0005 typeface. This is probably the 4th or 5th Casio watch I have owned over the years (my wife describes me as a 'gadget guru'). This watch has all the features I could ask for. Now that I have owned it for a week or so, I think I have it kind of figured out ... but I must admit that after the first few hours I was ready to call Amazon and discuss their return policy.It would really be nice if they had an option for a 'readable' instruction book. I may own this watch for several years before I figure out how to do 'everything', but for now I have figured out the most necessary functions. It's a great watch!!"
