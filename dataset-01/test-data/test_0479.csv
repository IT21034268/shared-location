5,cute animal patterns in simple knitting skills and lots of colors.,"If you are looking for cute animal patterns like rabbit, cow, griffle, duckie, etc and trains and boat kind of stuff in simple design. This is the book you want. Just Simple pullover or cardigan set with blankets, hats etc. Frankily, the designs of the sweaters are really nothing special. But it's all about the colors together with those cute motifs. And she gives a little life and texture to the animals motifs. Like by adding an dangling ear or wiggling tail. Good for beginners. Mostly just knit stitch. Very colorful, cute and cheerful for baby. Good range on sizes. She group the book into 3 main chapters by color - pastel, neutral and the brights. The thing I really love about this book is the photos. Very nice, clear, colorful and full or almost full page photos of the knitted products. Perhaps that's what making these very simple and ordinary designs so attractive."
5,Everything you ever wanted to know about child development,"One of the top-selling authors of child development texts, Helen Bee has done it again with her latest text. In contrast to many textbook authors, Bee is noted for her first-person approach in writing. She fills the book with personal anecdotes to accompany a very well referenced work. Student friendly would be my assessment.Tom Batsis School of Education Loyola Marymount University"
4,One of my favorite movies...,"I'm not a real Jon Cryer fan, though i usually like the characters he plays. Too bad this one panned in theaters...it's a gem.Writing was fantastic...lots of zingers and one-liners i still use in everyday life.LOVE the Thanksgiving scene where after everyone has gathered at Clare & Jacks - only to find them (by looking thru the window), in the back bedroom...and 'boyfriend' Flash says;""Is this Thanksgiving tradition in your country?""""Not at MY house, it isn't.""Maybe it's just my odd sense of humour, but i love this movie! Only wish it would be pressed onto DVD sometime soon...my VHS is gonna scrape off all the oxide from my tape before long!!!"
4,True Value.,"I got this printer about six months ago and it has proved to be quite robust. It can do just about anything a non-industrial guy like me needs done. I am even using it with my new computer and storing the one which came as part of the package. HP's bang per buck is rather amazing as, financially, this is an excellent deal which is why I probably will continue to favor this brand over others. Lastly, concerning the criticism below about the lack of a USB cable, he's right and I agree it's inappropriate, but leaving out extras is, unfortunately, common practice among companies today."
2,The Real McCoy,"This book was a disappointment because many of the sayings in it are not used anymore. I was hoping it would have more modern day sayings. The few ones that are there are good. This book would probably be more useful to the older generations (prior to baby boomers), as they have probably heard and/or used more of these sayings then newer generations have."
1,A Waste of $$,"This book was so weak - no character development, horrible dialogue, and poorly conceived plot development. The concept was almost there, but the execution is so far off the mark. Another reviewer referred to this book as the work of a college student. That's too much of a compliment."
4,"Action Packed, Doesn't let you take a breather","If you are looking for a book to give you a quick action fix this is the book for you. Higgins doesn't mess around with the background information found in other books of the same type. This is the perfect book for your plane ride or an afternoon under the shade tree. The players in the story are complex in their own ways, making it a page turner."
2,Mediocre Higgins...somewhat less than you'd expect,"As virtually all of the reviews here will attest, this is not one of Jack Higgins' best efforts. While Higgins writes in a very easy-to-read, approachable style, there isn't a lot of meat on this particular bone. If you feel like reading one of his newer works, try Flight of Eagles, which is plotted better and has a more interesting premise."
2,Disappointing - did Higgins really write this lightweight?,"From about chapter two, the style was so childish, that I almost put it down, but it's a good yarn. I finished it in two days, which is quick, since there was no challenge to the read, nothing technical to worry about (except what organisation is the 'KBG' found early on). It felt like a beginner had written it."
2,It's the same old story,"Jack higgins seems to have fallen into a rut. Of the last four or five novels he has written, has there been anything that is surprising? With The President's Daughter, once again, after reading the first 100 pages you know the story and how it will end. Sean Dillon and Brigadier Ferguson are smarter and have more resources than the bad guys and the conclusion is predictable. It is a quick and exciting read to get to the point of the story, but after that there is nothing compelling. Every character that is introduced is the best at what they do and can supply any information or material that is needed."
4,Dropping A Tired Formula Revitalized The Series,"Sean Dillon's 'ironic smile' has been wearing thin since he exploded on to the literary schene in On Dangerous Ground. The happy hitman, himself, seemed to be growing bored with the replay of a tiring formula.Jack Higgins took a detour in The President's Daughter which became his most enjoyable journey in years. There were more subplots than body counts, more character building than action scenes, and more suspense than the yawns of the last four Dillon-based novels.Higgins has developed quite a few new rogues to match Dillon in future stories. Hey Jack, return Sean Dillon to the dark side in the next chapter. He's a villain we could root for."
3,does not come with the seat,"The toliet shipped fast, we received it within 3 days of ordering. However we overlooked the fact that the seat is sold seperately. Would have been better if it was listed next to the name/ ordering information that it was without a seat. Now we will have to wait for a seat to come in."
2,NOT the TV Show Title Song,"While this is an entertaining CD, I'm wondering why no one other than myself has made mention of the fact that the title song is NOT the same as on the TV show. Isn't that what the title of this CD is leading you to believe? I have the shows on DVD and on every show the main title ""Hawaiian Eye"" song has complete words to them. That is the main reason I purchased it and was very disappointed. When I purchased this CD, the songs were not available to preview as they are now. So if you're looking for the TV soundtrack title song, ""Hawaiian Eye""....this ISN'T it. The song is mostly instrumental with a few ""Hawaiian Eye"" vocal parts thrown in. It is very misleading."
3,Great shows - compiled better elewhere,"While the performances on this compilation are mostly excellent, it was cut together so haphazardly that after a song ends, the spoken introduction for the next song is heard before the track ends, then they cut to a different track which doesn't match the intro you just heard due to their shuffling of the song sequence.Moreover, the same concerts and bonus material can be had (more completely and in original order) on ""All The Way From Stockholm To Philadelphia""(which has the Konserthuset, Stockholm 2/16/71& the Tower Theater, Philadelphia 11/29/72 shows)and the ""Two Miles From Live Heaven"" compilation(which has the Civic Center, Santa Monica 4/13/74material and the bonus studio demo material).IMHO, you'd be better off getting both (or either) of those."
4,Great Knife,Bought this for my husband on father's day. He has big hands and the grip handle is just a perfect fit for him. Blade is a little shorter than expected though.
3,Sog review,Great knife except kinda difficult to remove from the pocket. My downfall was when WALLYWORLD had it for 20$ cheaper .Besides the rest sharpest knife i own.
5,Really nice frames!!,"I read the reviews and saw that everyone was very pleased with these frames so I decided to give them a go. I was NOT disappointed! They are very attractive frames and despite their low price (they worked out to about $4 a frame after shipping), they are not cheaply made at all. Their design is very simple, and it's a cinch to insert and replace photos. I ordered 16 to start and printed my own photos to hang in my bedroom. They look great and I couldn't be happier. I plan to order 10 more to complete my redecorating plans. I highly recommend these frames. 5 stars!"
2,Not for mats,"I experimented with a couple of these for framing photographs with a standard window mat. The depth of the frame is too shallow to accept even a standard photographic mat. It is fine if you want to place a photograph and nothing else whatsoever in the frame.Trying to insert the glass after inserting a mat and photo cracks or breaks the corner of the frame, ruining it.Most frames include a statement regarding the depth (rabbet) available. These front-loading ""Format"" frames should bear a disclaimer regarding their limitation."
1,UNAUTHORIZED,"This book was written and published WITHOUT the consent of the band. I am a fan of AFI and out of respect for them, I would never purchase this book; I urge all AFI fans as well as anyone interested in purchasing this book to do the same."
3,"if you were a product of the eighties, or just a fan, wouldn't you already have these songs","If you're a product of the eighties, or just a fan of the music video era, than this collection will float you're boat. Eighteen songs, all number one hits, are gathered together on this collection. ""Eye of the Tiger,"" ""Addicted to Love,"" ""Everybody Wants to Rule the World,"" ""Every Breath You Take,"" ""When I See You Smile,"" ""Down Under,"" ""All Night Long,"" and plenty more are represented here. However, there are lots of number one songs that have been omitted, so I hope this compilation series continues. Then again, if you were a product of the eighties, or just a fan, wouldn't you already have these songs?"
3,POOR QUALITY PLAYBACK,"I recently purchased this item and was impressed by all the modes, screeens, folders, and features. nice machine. Smaller than i thought it was going to be but still easy to handle and carry in my pocket.Unfortuately, the one must-have quality, in my opinion, playback, was horrible. I recorded a message and played it back, turned up the volume so i could actually hear my message and the words became brackish, tinny and distorted. i barely recognized my own words. Too bad. i have had many recorders over the years and this one has very bad playback. i returned it."
3,Recording and listening,I bought the recorder and started using it. Relatively easy to use. Records fine but can't listen to what is recorded. Sound quality from built in speaker is bad.Sound is real good when connected to a computer.Would not buy again.
1,Not compatible with Mac,"Unfortunately, the software for this item is not compatible with a Mac operating system as is suggested in the product description. I spoke with the manufacturer today, and while you can plug the WS-100 into a Mac you can't upload or download voice files or other data. Obviously, I can't evaluate its performance because it's not compatible with my computer."
4,Geat Voice recorder,"I use the WS-100 to record inerviews - approx 15 to 30 min. long. I also purchased the little microphone that plugs into the WS-100. It works great. I use a MAC and have NO issues. I use Microsoft Media Player for the MAC for another app, so I did not have to download it. It is SIMPLE to use, a BIG PLUS."
5,Great Product,"I bought the item for my mother, and ended up buying a 2nd one for myself. It is very easy to use and gives a very clear recording when plugged into your USB port."
3,WS 100,"The recording has an echoing sound, so the quality of the recording is not as nice my classmates' who uses the ws 300 model. I place the recorder in the front of class so I don't have too many problems other than that slight echoing noise. the forward/rewind is tough when you have an hour or 2 of lecture to skim through. takes about 5 minutes of holding down the foward button, and an accidentaly press can make you spend another 5 minutes (maybe there's a function that can fast forward faster.. not sure)getting to that spot again, so I use my computer to listen to lectures with media player.On the positive side, it's quite durable"
3,Just OK. I like the original better,"I have both the original California Water Blade (the one with the T edge) and this one. The Grip Tech is cheap and works as described but I don't think it works as well as the California. On a car painted surface, since I finish the drying with a microfiber towel anyway, the little smudges of water left behind is no big deal. But on windows, the California does a better job of removing water that I don't need to finish with as much paper towel as I do with the Blade."
5,Best rug cleaner,"This is the best rug cleaner I've ever used. I found it by accident in a store on the boardwalk but have been buying it ever since. I use it strictly to get marks, stains, cat/dog urine out of the rug. it is very hard to find but I did find it in Walmart in the car care department. I would recommend this product to anyone."
4,recipe card dividers,I like these cards because there are many catagories which helps with the organization of family recipes.
1,"Lack of research, anybody?","This book states that the Blair Witch was an actual legend here in Maryland.....when it most certainly was not, and is pure fiction. Do your research before you actually write a book and spread false information. There are many ghosts and legends in this region of the state, but there are no 'witch' legends of any sort in Burkittsville."
5,BRILLIANT PRESENTATION!,ANYONE IN ANY FORM OF MEDIA AND THE ENTERTAINMENT FIELD SHOULD STUDY THIS BRILLIANTLY PRESENTED BOOK. SHOULD BE REQUIRED READING FOR STUDENTS OF THOSE FIELDS AS WELL. I also think it took some guts to write it!
5,Track Listing,Tracks: 1) Unforgettable-Nat King Cole 2) Fools Rush In-Dean Martin 3) Personality-Johnny Mercer 4) There! I've Said It Again-Vic Damone 5) Blue Moon-Dean Martin 6) Life Is A Song (Let's Sing It Together)-Count Basie & Tony Bennett 7) Mona Lisa-Nat King Cole 8) Careless Hands-Mel Torme 9) Red Roses For A Blue Lady-Vic Dana 10) As Time Goes By-Tony Bennett
1,cheap junk,Beware on this product! It won't last long. I now use (umbrella cover) for indoor use to cover my telescope. Save the wood parts for burning in your fireplace. Cheaply made junk!
5,"Where is the album ""Here Are The CKs""?","This CD is a substitute for their outstanding debut album of 1982, ""Here Are.."" Snooze? Well, I understand the sentiment but these guys re-invented sixties punk, and continue to do so. Some of the selections are a little less-inspired than say, their version of the Painted Ship's ""Little Whit Lies"". But they are masters of their craft. I saw them in '85 and '88 and was shocked by their punk sensibilities--slamming Bud tall boys and kicking people while piledriving through a cover of ""You Burn Me Up and Down"" (We the People).Look, these guys are great. They inspired a generation of post-punk refugees and gave big middle fingers to the Brie-cheese-synth-crapola popular during the day, as well as spanking the dumpster-chicken LA piss-fits posing as CK mannquins.Can we get reissues of the first three albums, ""Here Are.."", ""Stop"", and ""Don't Open Til Doomsday""? A real cultural contribution that would be..."
3,"Good image & features, bad design, inflexible pixel policy","I bought my 191T+ to relieve eye strain. The quality of the picture and the effect on my eyes is a huge improvement over the 17"" CRT I had been using before. It does not seem any brighter than my Apple Studio display at home (although it is supposed to be), but it certainly does the job on that point.My main complaint is that there is a dead subpixel on mine right in the middle of the screen. While I knew that Samsung had an 8-pixel policy, I had hoped that they would make an exception for a pixel positioned so inconveniently. No dice. So I am stuck looking at a red spot right in the middle of my document. It's distracting.My other complaint is that the monitor only swings one way, and in my office that is away from CPU and power outlet. The result is that I need to have a lot of slack in the cords on my desk if I want to swing to portrait mode, which is both ugly and annoying."
5,Great product at a great price,I no longer have itchy skin. I like the shuttle smell of the coconut lime and will order more. Keep it right next to the shower and look forward to applying.
4,Very nice,This is my first review on a product but I figured I would start writing them because I do not buy anything without first consulting the customer reviews. This body butter is very nice. My skin is very picky but I found that it absorbs pretty well without TOO much greasy feeling after. I used it after the sugar scrub so maybe I'll try them separately and see if I like it better then. The scent is more lime than coconut but very refreshing. I hope this review helps someone! I'm going to try the other scents by this company to see if I like them as well.
3,unwrapped jars,"Two jars were not shrink-wrapped and could have been opened before I received them. Don't know if this is the fault of the manufacturer. I like the product but probably won't use the unwrapped jars. Three jars for what I paid was a great value; one jar, not so much."
1,Most vile smell ever,"This is the strongest, most disgusting smell ever. I have a terrible scent headache from this lotion. I'll either return it or use it as a stinkbomb."
1,Bad Synthetic Fragrance,"Although this is touted as a natural product, it has a nasty synthetic fragrance as it's base which is really vile. Don't buy it, get Kiss my Face, Desert Essence, or some truly natural shea butter product instead."
3,The bad songs took the other two stars!,"Kelly...amazing voice. She has talent, and no one can deny that. I think the pressure and pace of the summer competition took it's toll on an untrained singer, but nothing she won't bounce back from.The songs, however, are ABYSMAL! I'm talking lounge-acts-will never-touch-them and they can't fade into obscurity quickly enough. They remind me of cheesy wedding fare, but if I picked these for a wedding song, it would be grounds for divorce! I can only think these were cranked out during a fuzzy navel-induced haze, as they are absolutey horrid in terms of lyrical prowess or soulful melodies. Each bad song took away a star.Kelly is definitely going to be heard from again...I just hope that it's material worthy of her talent."
1,Kelly Good/Songs Bad,Kelly Clarkson is a wonderful talent but what [person] picked these songs for her. They are boring! I look forward to hearing Kelly sing material that is good enough for her talent. These songs are not.
3,"Good, but available on the Idol full-length disc!","The 2 songs here are great and this is a fine buy for Kelly and American Idol completists, but these same 2 songs are also available on the Idol full-length cd! Don't bother getting this if you are planning on getting the other cd!"
2,Cheezier Than Justin's Hair,"I'll admit Kelly can sing - but c'mon! These songs should be on a Disney soundtrack. In a pop world of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera and Nsync, Kelly should have started off with a dance song. We've all seen her showcase her vocal range all summer, give us something different. Also, does anybody else get the feeling that Kelly is strictly being used as a pawn to promote the American Idol franchise more than anything else? ""I can't believe it's happening to me / Some people wait a lifetime for a moment like this?"" that ain't no love song! Its the unofficial theme for winning American Idol!"
2,Wonderful singer forced to produce tripe,"Poor Kelly. Let us hope that she can establish a good career so that she won't have to continue to sing this kind of sappy garbage the AI people are trying to cram down our throats. Don't get me wrong... I loved the show, and was rooting for Kelly since the pack narrowed to 10. But these songs are tired, insipid, wholly unoriginal, and are of no artistic merit aside from Miss Clarkson's voice.If I am to retain any respect for this artist, I have to believe that she cringed all the way through these recording sessions."
4,Spoonbread and Strawberry Wine,"Great book. Was a little dissappointed to know that there was no recipe for Peach cobbler. Other than that, I love that the recipes. They are easy to follow and remind me of my Grandmother's lessons when she taught me to cook."
3,Ok,I read this book awhile ago. I had read several books with pregnancy theme and was a little tired of the theme.
3,Delicious but deadly food,"Just what you might expect. Buttery cholesterol laden food that almost everyone loves! 'They' now tell us now it might kill you, but what the heck? It is a review of reicpes from many roadside eateries in coastal New England. I find much of it repetitive, after all, how many ways are there to deep fry a clam?If you love this vacation food, it is fun. As a cookbook, it is very limited.DOC"
3,"Great fun, too easy","I got this game 2 days ago and I already beat it. It was really fun and I especially loved designing the cafe.I'm not really sure what age level this is for and I'm 11 so it may be for younger kids. The mini games were all pretty boring except for the rollarblading game. It was also really cool that you could talk on a cell phone. If you want a game that will last a while, don't buy it. I guess this would be okay for a kid maybe 8 years old."
1,BORING,"I am Arianna and I am 10 yrs old. I bought this game and when i started playing it it was fun. I finished the game the day after. I was like ""THAT'S IT?!?!?!?!"" I thought the game was too easy"
3,"Fun, but Short.",This game is so fun at first. But it is really short. I finished it in 2 days. Overall it is O.K. You should have a better selection in look than just hair color/shirt color/pants color.It sounds fun but you might want to think twice about getting this game.
2,a very slow starter,"My husband totally hyped this book up - he's a huge Abbey fan - and I was pretty let down. Nothing really happened for the first 100 pages, and seriously - who wants a two-three page detailed lesson on how to operate a huge piece of machinery? Not me. I consider myself an environmentalist, and was amused by the idea presented by the book...but the story itself was way too predictable, little character development, and not the best work Edward Abbey has done. A better fiction piece by Abbey is The Fool's Progress."
1,An extremely difficult read,"Terrible. Unbelieveable characters. I assume Edward Abbey wanted us to think of this rag-tag group of EF'ers as heroes? Didn't work. Their cause is just, their methods criminal. This book should be prescribed for those with a sleep disorder - will put you in a coma in under 5 minutes... Is there something less than 1 star? I would never have finished it had it not been required reading in a mandatory class at school. I expect an ""A"" simply because I endured this torture!"
1,Hypocritical elitists,"This is definitely Abbeys poorest work. Abbey fails to mention he too enjoyed the conveniences of driving a gas guzzler and other wasteful means of living in a big city. The obsurdity of libs claiming enviro groups like ALF and ELF are ""right wing"" is just a diversion to justify and soften the blow for their selfish actions. Though I enjoyed Abbeys other writings, I think this book is misguiding highly impressionable lost souls who still live with mommy and daddy. Johnny ""Tali-boy"" Walker is a good example of misguided idealism. If you really want to know more about Environmentalism and its core beliefs, then read Karl Marx's ""Communist Manifesto"""
1,English Dictionary and Thesaurus,"I returned mine. Customer support was awful. There was the endless loop of the automated voice mail and the passing through 6-7 different persons who were supposedly able to help, but kept passing me to the ""right"" technical support."
3,Mignola-esque,"The other reviewers have done a pretty comprehensive job describing the stories in this trade paperback, but what really bugs me about it is that with the exception of ONE story that is INKED by Mignola, NONE OF THE ARTWORK IS BY MIGNOLA!!!Some of the artwork is highly Mignola-esque, and some of the panel breakdowns are surely his. But when I buy a graphic novel that is listed under an artist's name, I want that artist's work. I get a kick out of Mignola's tongue-in-cheek take on the Cthulhu mythos, but what I'm really looking for is his terrific artwork!This is the second time I've been burned buying a ""Mignola"" book (I'm likewise underwhelmed by C.Golden's Hellboy novelizations, with a handful of Mignola illos.) I'd REALLY like to see a better description in the Product Description. At this point, I don't feel I can buy ""Mignola"" books on-line!"
5,Great spin-off!,"Just the tip of the iceburg! Great start to a promising series. If you like Hellboy, you will enjoy this."
4,good book,"while i would prefer to read solely about hellboy himself, reading about the bprd is entertaining. the stories contained in this volume fit well into the hellboy mythos. while the art is not mignola's, it has it's own flair to it that sets the mood. the writing is good of course, and the title story and the others hold up well to what has been published in the past. i would of course urge any fan of hellboy and his universe to pick this one up if they have not already. if you are looking to read something different and are a fan of comics, this will hold you over, and i guarantee you will be hooked."
3,Not enough detail!,"I wish I could just ask questions directly about this item, it would make it much easier to know what they are selling. It's hard to purchase an item like this when they do not let you know what modification to the Metz SCA 3202 they are selling.The picture makes one think this may be the very first modification ""M"", which was produced in 11/00. They have six other modifications after that, M2 through M7. The M5 modification on 04/06 made it compatible with cameras like the 45 CL-4 & 76 MZ-5, and others, the last modification in 12/08 M7 made modifications for the some Panasonic models. If this is really the first version M, then it is old. It will probably work with your camera, except for certain functions that I am unaware of.They really need to be more specific about this item!"
5,Easy Grammar,I love this book - use it all the time when I am teaching English in China. Exercises are adaptable and so easy to use
3,for people moving to Paris,A huge amount of information in this book was really not for the one-week vacationer but for those planning to live there for an extended period of time.
4,correct reasoning,"The text is clear and thorough. I'm learning more on each reading. I'm completely satisfied, and may order more books by this author."
2,Disappointed in Chris....,"I have to say that I purchased this dvd and I wasn't very happy with it as I usually laugh at his material. Most of his material on this dvd wasn't funny at all. I found myself somewhat speeding up the dvd to the next joke just so that I could get a laugh. In my opinion, if you're going to buy it, then buy it used so that you won't feel like you paid too much for it if you're disappointed. I'm hesitant to buy his ""Bring the Pain"" dvd due to I don't know what to expect."
2,Swears every other word,"Not entertaining and not up to his potential. He is one of the funniest commedian to come along, but not in this video. Every other word is swearing & is very redundant. If you don't find the ""N"" word, the ""P"" word, and the ""F"" word funny, you won't find this video funny either. Very disappointing."
2,average,compared to bring the pain this is dull.the material just doesn't hit as hard as Bring the pain.it has some okay lines but overall it's just so-so.he was far funnier on the Mtv Video awards show.
2,Chris Rock Is Not Funny,"This show is just plain boring. It's that simple. Most of his jokes are dumb and sleazy and he complains about some of the dumbest things you can think of. If you don't think the 3 Stooges are funny, then this is not for you. It isn't funny. That's all I should say. It's just dumb stand-up."
3,Good product but...,"This is actually a good product, but has some drawbacks. On/off switch is counter to custom in the US. Also, the clipper does not come adjusted for use out of the box. After struggling with it initially, I figured out how to adjust the clipper clearance. Has worked well since then over several seasons of clearing. Mostly use it to clip down Scotch Broom for fire clearance."
2,Poulan Products dont start,"Got this hedge trimmer as a gift. It worked well the first time. Each time since, I can't get it started even when following the instructions plastered on the decal. How mad I was when I wanted to use it this weekend and ended up laying out all the extension cords so I could use my old electric one. I have one other Poulan product, a lawn mower. It won't start without using starting fluid. In addition to starting, this thing is really heavy, so you'd better be a strong person to use it."
4,Good printer if you download the drivers,"This is a good printer, Quality is nice, self-aligns for those of us who can't read one of those printer alignment sheets if our lives depend on it. Some notes for good function/performance:1. Don't use the drivers shipped with it. Connect to the HP web site and download the latest drivers.2. Use it in PCL5 or Postscript mode. The native mode eats computer processor cycles like there is no tommorow.3. The print quality directly affects the lifespan of the cartridges. Note that it ships with a low capacity black cartridge. Go out immediately and order the 69ml replacement and you should get several thousand pages of print on normal pages."
2,Not a fast printer,"Advertised as printing 7 pages per minute normal color, but we only got about 3.5 in normal, printing a mostly B&W spreadsheet without graphics. Used a black ink quickly. Also (messed) up page order (possibly bad print driver software). Would not especially recommend this for a small business and there are cheaper ones just as good for a home user."
2,ONLY FRENCH LANGUAGE! NO SUBTITLES AT ALL!,"The movie itself is kinda silly. My opinion is, that it is only worth purchasing, if you are a Ludivine Sagnier fan. Cos she is mindblowingly pretty in this flick. Unfortunately, there is not much nudity; you could only see her amazing tits once!"
2,"Not inspired. I want quality, not quantity","While this book contains hundreds upon hundreds of character trademarks, very few of them are rendered well. A very small portion are clean, sharp and crisp. Poor quality graphics are to be expected of those marks from the '30s, '40s and '50s but even the latest marks were poorly rendered. Most of the figures looked as if they had been through a copy machine 5 or 6 times before publication or poorly traced with a black pen. Where is the style in the strokes? Where is the artistry?I think this book is a case of QUANTITY rather than QUALITY. This book could have used some serious editing to include only 200 of the best and most influential and successful character marks of the century with more about their history and evolution. I was impressed however at the painstaking dilligence in compiling such a large library of trademarks."
5,Excellent replacement battery,"Arrived quickly, was an easy install (based on directions widely available on the web) and has given my Palm a new lease on life!Great solution if you have a Palm battery going bad."
3,"2 types, thick & thin cable","I like this design because when not in use, it folds to about zero size. I bought one at a mall kiosk, and decided I wanted another, so ordered it by brand name.I was disappointed that the ""anti-tangle"" stiff and rough and thick cord wasn't part of this particular one. I don't think there's a model number to distinguish, just the era it was made.This might have been a better in-person purchase than online."
1,don't waste your money,"This is a piece of trash. The quality of the transmission is terrible, while the piece of electronics works. Never mind what freq you tune it to, it is noisy, noisy, noisy. On the other hand it did not last that long. After a few months of use it died. Doesn't work either with the bat's or with the cigarrette lighter adaptor it comes with. The people at Belkin should do some more work before going to market with a piece of electronics like this. Never heard of someone using an i-trip complaining about their piece of equipment."
4,good,this is my second transmitter and it works pretty good for me with my sansa c250 I really don't have any complaints alot better than the dynex I had watch was a real problem
4,Good Product,Bought 3 of these for christmas 2007. They are very nice. Digital tuner is a big plus. They work very well as long as you can find an unused channell on FM in your area. Might be a problem in big citys. Where I live these baby's rock !!! Also good for watching movies on laptop computer cause speakers are weak. Just tune in the radio and plug in the Belkin. Belkin makes a very good product. The tuner will turn on as soon as it recognizes audio input. There is also pre set stations programable.
3,The expectation was higher..,I had a high expectation for the FM transmitter.What I didn't like: 1)RF power (transmitter has to be pretty close to the receptor - radio); 2) The sounds come with too much Bass; 3) Low life for the batteriesWhat I do like: 1) an option to use the power cord while you are using into the car
1,Not good in cities with lots of radio stations,"I live in Atlanta, where there are radio stations on virtually every point on the dial. Unfortunately, I cannot get a good signal with this transmitter. At this point, I'm thinking about another stereo altogether."
1,Died After 1 Hour of Use,"Received this as a B'day present from my son, used it once for an hour, sound was OK but not wonderful. Went to use it a second time, preparing for a trip and the sucker is dead. Tried new batteries, read the manual, fiddled with the batteries again, played with the buttons some more, nothing. Zip, Nada. I don't have the receipt since it was a gift, so Belkin won't fix or replace it. I remember back when Belkin was a premium brand name. I guess those days are long gone."
1,not satisfied,"I've had this item for a little over six months now. It started out where the transmitter would just turn off randomly every couple of times I used it. Now, it turns off on average 1-3 times during each song. Also, you have to hold the plug in the ipod to hear out of both car speakers. What a waste of money!"
3,Poor range.,"This unit works as advertised, however there is not much range to the FM transmitting. You have to put the FM Receiver right next to the FM Transmitter to hear the sound clearly. You can not receive the signal clearly across the room."
2,This sucks; don't waste your money,"I own 2 of these. They both have broken with the same exact problem. The power connector cable stops sending power to the device. The same thing happened to the headphone piece of the cable, now I can't even use it with batteries. When it worked it was just ok, mainly because of the short length of the headphone cable. What a waste. I am sure there are better models out there."
2,Be ready for a struggle to use this device,"I purchased the Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter device assuming it would be simple to plug it in and play it. In truth, I have not yet found the FM frequency on my auto radio that will act as host for the MP3 player and it's content.The explanation of use and user instructions leave much to be desired.The device looks good, but has not yet performed for me. I would dearly like to get my money back or exchange for a device that would work.James A. Gardner [...]Belkin TuneCast II FM Transmitter for MP3 Players (Black)TuneCastII Mobile FM Trans-Wht"
3,"OK in car, has limited use elsewhere","I've read a lot of reviews where users could not get this to work in the car. It works great in my car, although there are only 2 frequencies that work well. Its effectiveness in the car may depend on external variables such as the position of the car's antenna (front or back) and geography (more urban areas will have less open FM space) - not just the strength of the transmitter (that is my own speculation).Even though it works very well in my car, I gave it three stars because it does not work with any other applications such as home stereo. The concept is great and it should be able to work anywhere but its use seems to be limited for most users."
2,"At first, it was mediocre at best","With either a Rio MP3 player, or an Ipod Nano, I did not recieve a very strong signal. The sound was never crisp, no maater where it was placed in the car, and seemed to me to add some bass that wasn't needed. (maybe that was just me) Then, the plug that was used to insert into the headphone jack broke under light use. (the rubber base around it was way to flimsy. Also the amount of cords this item is equipped is a bit ridiculous. My dash looked like it was wired for a bomb. I would not recommend this product, especially since I have purchased an iriver aft 100. Clean sound, ease of use, and more visually pleasing."
1,Underpowered transmitter,"I wouldn't give this awful fm transmtter to anyone. When the cars radio does recieve the tranmission the quality is terrible, but most of the time it picks up noise and a little of the transmited signal no matter which frequency is selected. Very poor gaget."
5,Belkin FM Transmitter,I only needed the part with which you can charge the transmitter in your car and it works fine.
2,not what i was hoping for,"poor, distorted sound quality. i bought this based on the belkin name and should have checked the reviews first!! sorry belkin!! this one just doesn't cut it!!"
1,Not Very good,"I was so happy to get this until i used it it almost never was able to clearly broadcast a signal always static and distortion no matter what station, battery life, distance to antenna, volume on the ipod. the battery life was also very poor. i went through 2 of these and both of them i hated and did not last long i have yet to find a good one except my friend uses the iriver one and it seems to have a clear signal but the auto off is a con and there are no batteries which would be a nice option"
2,Works fine but power hungry,"Bought this to replace a similar item (iRock) that did not have auto-power-off, thinking my batteries would last longer since I no longer would run them down forgetting to shut the stupid thing off. Well the auto off works great but I am going through batteries MUCH faster than I did with the old unit. Other than this the unit works fine, but I am going back to the iRock."
3,"Works in some cars, but not all","I used this with my iPod in both of my cars. It works perfectly in my '89 Oldsmobile; excellent reception, clear sound quality, no loss of signal. However, when I used this in my 2000 Toyota Avalon, the signal was faint and I had to move it around to try and pick up the signal. I certainly couldn't pick up the signal without having to hold the transmitter up in midair. I certainly am not going to drive with one hand while holding this with the other. The only difference among the cars that I could note are that the Oldsmobile has an old-style whip antenna in the rear, while the Toyota has an antenna integrated into the rear window. So I guess that may be the thing; I really don't know. One other thing to note is that this is a battery hog. I went through a set of batteries in just one week of light use! I would simply recommend that you try different transmitters before settling on one."
2,FM Sound Quality is Poor / On Off Operation is Confusing,"I found the operation of this device somewhat confusing. It must have seemed innovative to the designers to remove the on/off button and have the device sense when it needs to turn on, but it makes for more confusion rather than a better experience. For example, if the car adapter is plugged in, but the car isn't running, the device won't turn on, even if your mp3 player is connected and playing. However, the biggest reason why this item is sitting on my shelf is sound quality. It is simply not good enough for me to enjoy my music. This issue is not specific to the Belkin model, but to FM transmitters in general. Be warned before you buy one of these that if you are at all picky about hearing an mp3 sound like it's coming out of a crappy radio, you should look elsewhere. I recommend getting an auxiliary input installed into your car stereo if you can afford the extra expense."
1,Utterly Useless Junk,"Just got this thing and it is wretched. The main problem is that it will NOT tune to a frequency below 88.0. Most cities only have 87.9 and lower free of broadcasts and bleed over. Since the Belkin will not tune below that, all I get is static or some local station and never my MP3 player.I've tried using it with both a 3rd generation Apple iPod and a Creative Labs MUVO. It's equally pathetic with both. It also has an ""Auto On"" which is supposed to turn the unit on when it detects the audio from your player. Yeah, right. It never turns on, and the manual ON/OFF switch won't power it up either!I'm returning this to Amazon and switching back to headphones. It was tempting to throw it out the window of my car and drive over it repeatedly, but I need the 26 bucks too much. Still, this thing is such a disappointment it is tempting....."
1,Unacceptable volume level,"I may have purchased this item before it was ready. If so, BELKIN take note and send me a new one!This product is unusable. I wish I had taken the time to return it. The modulation level is SO low that I could not listen comfortably even with my radio turned up to FULL VOLUME. Either the signal is far too weak, or the modulation is insufficient. I am an electronics engineer, so I know how to select a clear channel, adjust volume levels, etc. I tried it with SEVERAL input sources and radios.Either way, it was a TOTAL WASTE of $30, and never worked for me. The features are GREAT, but mine DOES NOT WORK, not even at 6 inches away. - Paul pfirth7@yahoo.com"
2,It works but not GOOD for CARS,"The Belkin Portable Music TuneCast II FM Transmitter (F8V3080) is good because it comes with a power cable (it can also use batteries) and will shut off on it's own and can go through many stations instead of 4 to broadcast over. I had a iRiver MP3 player and got the belkin so I could play it in my car but as I drove the station(s) got stronger and my music sounded horrible ... very low and staticy. So basically it was worthless to me and I returned it. It might be good to broadcast over other equipment in a stationary environment (ie. laptop, radio @ home) but I cannot real say because that is not why I bought it. So because of that and the fact that my MP3 player did not work with a cassette adaptor I am returning my mp3 player as well. Get yourself a Panasonic MP3 Discman SL-SX430 and a cassette adaptor and live it up!"
1,I can sing to myself better than this........,"I started off using the Belkin unit with 4 pre-set stations and no ability to tune it to other stations. All 4 stations were in use so off I went buying this unit. I found 2 spots in the frequency range with no other transmissions. The reception is extremely poor at both these spots. Stopping close to another car/wall makes matters worse.I think that the transmitter strength is not up to doing the job in an SUV. This was the bigest waste of time and money. Like somebody well known recently said: ""Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on you"""
4,Works great for me,"No problems with this unit at all so far. Works great, easy to find a station it tunes in good on, the memory presets are very handy. Only thing that takes it down is the auto-shutoff. It would be great if they could incorporate a little switch to toggle it. Otherwise it shuts down on tracks that have ""secret"" content after a while of blank stuff."
2,Acceptable at best,"I received this FM transmitter as a gift, and it is adequate. My wife and I used it to amplify audio from our laptop for watching DVDs on a trip. It works okay, but there is a considerable amount of static in most geographic locations. Most of the time you can switch the frequencies to avoid heavy static, but it does take time to do this and a small amount of static cannot be avoided. If your vehicle has a cassette player I STRONGLY urge you to get a cassette adapter instead of this FM transmitter. The cassette version is the same as it pugs into any standard headphone jack, but it eliminates most if not all of the static, because it's wired instead of transmitting through the air and competing with radio stations. Overall, this FM transmitter will do in a pinch if your vehicle doesn't have a cassette player. Just don't expect more from this product than what I've described."
3,Works - if you can get it within 15 inches of the antenna,"I had bought the product to be able to listen to XM online at home in other rooms away from my PC, but it's pretty useless one you get beyond 12-15 inches away from the antenna. This one's going back to Best Buy, unfortunately."
3,"It works, and sound is OK.","I have had this little unit for about a month. It took awhile the find the right station ""88.7"" for me but now that I have I get a fair sound. Battery Life is about 8 hour's tops. I only use this cause I wanted to make use of my in home XM SkiFi in my new VW. If you really like clean clear music all the time this is not for you. But no FM transmitter that I have found will give you the sound you get from CDs."
4,Works very well,"The FM transmitter works very well in my 2005 Cadillac Deville. Car came without a tape player, only radio and CDs. Small battery cassette tape player plugged into Belkins FM transmitter give excellent sound quality thru car's radio speaker system. Now I can still enjoy the tapes I have enjoyed over the years."
2,Just doesn't work well,"This thing barely works, I have been using this in my car and it is constantly having reception and static issues.When it is not staticy it's auto-on feature just decides to turn off in the middle of playing and has to be manually turned back on.I really can't think of anything good about this device."
4,Great Deal!,"This was a surprisingly good investment. My only complaint was that the volume can be low at times but some fine tuning with the radio station usually helps. Furthermore, the ability to use it was the car adapter or on batteries is a great option!"
1,Don't bother....,"I went through THREE of these things at a local retail outlet and not a single one worked. I ended up having to get the next one up in price range to get a working unit. *smirk* If they don't work after just being shipped to a store, that doesn't speak well of their ability to take abuse."
3,Doesn't work in Berkeley,"When I do get a signal in Berkeley,CA - it's full of static. It goes in and out - way annoying and very distracting from the road trying to tune it to no avail. Can't compete w/ all the radio signals. I've tried tuning it to every FM channel available. It did work on my road trip out to Anzo Borrego Desert and even in Riverside area, in a very spread out suburban area. I got too much static in Huntington Beach, CA, a suburban community about an hour south of LA.i guess the other option for car listening is a tape-deck adaptor or portable speakers. i'm looking into buying some kind of audio deck for my car that i can plug ipod into directly - if it exists, I imagine it costs a lot."
1,Simply doesn't work! Save your money.,"When I tried the first version of the TuneCast it didn't work at all. TuneCast II connects, but if there is a radio station in North America that uses any given frequency, your TuneCast signal will drop. I've tried dozens of channels and none work for more than a few minutes. Unless you get no stations or static at all somewhere in a very remote part of the country, this product simply isn't strong enough to provide consistent signal. It surprises me they are still selling them. Good idea, very bad performance!"
1,Horrible Reception....Not Worth a Penny!!!,"I live in New York City and none of the free(?) frequencies work for this peice of garbage.I spent almost five hours searching for any frequency that would be tolerable for me to listen to...but could find none.Some were better than the others in terms of the amount of noise you'll hear. But, none were bearable enough....In short, this garbage isn't worth a penny!!!Don't make the same mistake that I made.Save your time and energy and shop for something else."
1,Does not deliver,"I gave this unit every chance - I tried in two different cars, with two different players, in various positions, on and off the car charger. But the output was awful. Where it came across at all, it was quiet and static filled. The slightest bump would cause it to lose the signal and the extremely loud static that followed - my radio being turned up so high to hear the music - was jarring.Don't buy this product. I don't know if there is a better option out there, but in my market - Columbus, OH - it was impossible to make this work. Plus, the cord is too short. (a minor parting peeve - had it actually worked, I'd have made do.)I'll be returning this today."
1,Completely useless,"I bought this to use in the car with my Creative Zen Vision M. I already have a portable Sirius Satellite Radio that slots in a holster in my car and broadcasts through my car radio using an FM signal. The Sirius works really well with sound quality that matches that of most FM broadcast radio stations and I expected the Belkin to be similar.It is not. The sound quality ranges from pathetic, through absolutely unlistenable to no signal at all. Anyone who has rated this higher than one star is deaf. I tried it on my home stereo system and the quality was only marginally better.Don't waste your time on this - better to spend the money on portable speakers. Mine is going back tomorrow."
2,not impressed,"After reading the other reveiws I thought this item might work ok for my needs. I listen to audio books on my way to and from work. I was willing to give up a little sound quality in trade for convience. Up untill now I have not been able to find a channel that will stay fairly clear for my whole trip. I have given up on using it, and reverted back to my cassete style converter. I dont want the distraction of trying to retune this unit while driving on the highway.As others have said, this would work well in rural areas. If you are close to or commute to a larger city then expect problems."
4,Good Product,"This product is a very good product in terms of reception while you have it connected in your 12v connector, it does not perform well if you have it on batteries only.On the other hand the cable that connects to the receiver got broken with the use after aproximately 6 months of use. This I believe because of the continuos movement of the receiver and the MP3.Anyway I purchased another one."
2,Only buy if you live with the cows!!,"Pricey item with no guarantee that it will work in your area. If you are in a metro area, it's practically impossible to find a frequency without a signal. The concept is a great idea, but unless you are in more of a rural area, pass on this item and get the Sony cassette adapter (much better value)-they make one that has a spring loaded tension that gives great quality sound through your cars sound system. I also highly recommend Belkin's car adapter- it plugs into the lighter and charges the battery while you play your iPod. I picked up a ""splitter"" (most dept. stores or auto parts supply)for my lighter that gives me two sockets to plug in - allowing me to plug in my radar detector AND my iPod- a sweet combination for road trips!!"
5,Cool device,"This thing works great with one exception. And this is just my experience. In the car, for some reason it works better with the AC adapter. I don't know why because at work I use it with my Boombox and it works fine with the batteries."
1,belkin tune cast fm transmitter for mp 3 player,never received this item after being told it shipped. i was given credit for it.
2,I Was Warned,"In spite of less than sparkling reviews from others, I have it a try. I have no idea where the FM antennae is on my Expedition. It's probably embedded in a window somewhere but this Belkin only works well if I hold it up to the windshield near the mirror. Anywhere else and it's too noisy to enjoy. I chose this because some of the higher rated units had to be plugged in to a lighter adapter and I wanted something I could use where there was no 12vdc plugI can't see this being of use unless you live where there are only a couple of FM stations on the air. Otherwise, you'll get bleed through unless you tape it to the radio in the right position. In my car, it's essentially worthless."
1,static everywhere,"I tried lots of stations, adjusted volumes, adjusted device location relative to my antenna and still, though I could hear the audio, the static was intolerable. I returned it."
2,It's okay but not great,"As a muscic lover I am not crazy about using it, because it is staticy whereever I go (city, small city, country) so I can't really ENJOY the music. So out of the box I would not recommend it, but you might be able to fiddle with it, but I haven't done that yet."
2,Cant HEar clearly,I can't hear very clearly with this item. For the price I say it Okay. Be Sure to wipe it with Alcohol before use I got a ear infection because I didnt.
2,Poor Quality Product,"This brand was one of the brands recommended by my nursing school. I bought it in a bundled package for around $30.00. After starting into my first quarter and comparing with other stethoscopes I was very disappointed. I had purchased a cheap $10.00 stethoscope at Wal-mart just to practice with prior to buying the prestige and I could actually hear better with that. My second week into my second quarter the prestige ended up breaking. Aside, from that I was always having to check if all the pieces were screwed on tight otherwise they would just fall off. After comparing the prestige to other brands, I would definately go with the Littman. It's a little bit more money but definately a better quality and comes with a 2 year warranty."
4,This sure is purty,There are other better books for history but this one is appealing to the eyes. Pic's at the start of each chapter were picked to stun the reader i think. If you're looking for a guide book or more of a technical manual this is not the book for you. Its a history book.
1,didnt come at all,"i had ordered this for my granmother's birthday because she like the mentos in the box and not the wrapper. Not only did it not come, no one called or emailed me and i missed my granmother's birthday."
2,He NEVER should have disbanded White Zombie,"Rob Zombie is sadly becoming a parody of himself...the past 2 releases since he left White Zombie are all mediocre at best and he continues on the same path with this album. I think that music has taken a back seat to his now bergeoning movie directing career. The only redeeming tracks on this album are ""American Witch"" and ""Let it all bleed out"" which utilize pretty good riffs. The first hint that RZ was on a major downward spiral was when I heard horns playing on the Sinister Urge album...My advice would be for him to quit while he is well-behind...he will never recapture the magic of White Zombie. ""La Sexorcisto"" is probably my second favorite album of all time: there is not one weak track on that album. Astro Creep 2000 was a solid follow up, although it was much more synth-oriented.Don't waste your time with this solo crap...get La Sexorcisto & AC2000 from WZ from White Zombie..."
5,Just Saw Rob Zombie 03/26/2006,"Just saw him in concert at the 930 club and he was great. I was waiting and waiting for this cd to come out and I'm so happy to have it my hands. I love Rob Zombie and this is great. I agree it is a little different, but it has a fresh new feel yet still the same Rob Zombie. I can't wait to rock this cd out! Def go to the store right now and pick it up! you won't be let down"
1,Oh man what happend??>,I was on amazon picking up some old zombie albums and wasn't even aware this album existed. I know now why.. HOLY CRAP! this is terrible! I'm at a loss for words..
1,death obbsesion,he is obbsed with deathi did however ride/rape an educated horse once cause im an incest freak (i dont reccomend this)
3,where has the zombie scream gone,"I've been a zombie fan from day one and love almost everything he's done music and movies, but this album just didn't do it for me. I don't really know why if its john 5 or his new singing style. This album lacks his hellbilly scream entirely. I like the laid back old school look on the album though. There are some good licks on some of the tracks, but for the most part its pretty bland. I'd have to say my fav song on the album is Let It All Bleed Out but even that one isn't up to par with past stuff. My least fav is of course that rediculous Foxy Foxy. Aside from this not being a very good one from him I would still give him an overall rating of a 4 check out astro-creep 2000 even though that is WZ its amazing, or of course hellbilly deluxe. I hope his new one is just as great as that one was for a lot of kids. It would be a shame to name it hellbilly deluxe 2 and not be as good or like this album."
1,Pretty Awful,"First of, John 5 is an amazing guitar player, but he is restrained to power chords on this release just like he was in Manson. But he can wail, just listen to his solo stuff. I can only assume that person didnt know much about his guitar style.That said, his inclusion doesnt really add up to much on Educated Horses. The whole thing falls dead on its feet in under 40 minutes. I understand change and new direction but this just seems so forced and fake. The riffs are the same ol' back forth notes, with a few pretentious acoustic numbers. The cool horror film samples would have helped this album some, but not much. Get everything he has done before this, but skip the new one cause it is average at best."
3,it sucks.,"yes im gonna say it. rob zombie can draw, he can sing, compose music and direct movies but he can't do em all at the same time and make em worth while. this album was the first album by rob I ever took directly back tot he music store after listening to it and tryed to return it because it sucked so bad.there's barely anything on here worth listening to and the songs that ar eokay have pieces to em that seem like he was just going through the motions or should ahve stopped a little earlier than he did. dont ge tme wrong, listenign to sherry moon zombie moan 'oh yeah give it to me baby"" in a loop is hot but it gets annoying after you hear her say it after tow or three loops.the only song really that sticks out is let it all bleed out as worth listening to. hoefully this album is not a sign of things to come for mr. zombie and he'll get back to his hellbilly roots we've all known to love."
1,Retire PLEASE,"I used to like Rob Zombie, up until Hellbilly Delux. Everything after that is garbage. This album is no exception. Every song sounds the same and is very predictable. The lyrics are nonsensical, Educated Horses? He says that phrase in like 3 or 4 songs on this CD, I think he is running out of material and throwing crappy CD's together to scrap in some extra money. He needs to quit before everyone forgets he used to be talented. I don't recommend this CD to anyone except the die-hard stalker-type fans that will buy all of his CD's/merchandise regardless. 1 star, I went through this CD in less than 10 minutes, very disappointed, and will never put it back into a CD-player again."
5,Best speakers for <$150,"Altec Lansing has done a superb job while designing these fabulous looking speakers to ensure that the treble (high-end frequencies), mid-range and bass are all wonderfully reproduced in harmony without any particular frequency dominating the overall sound. In fact, the overall sound quality of these speakers reminds me very much of my $700 Boston Acoustics speakers for the home theater - that by itself, is a big accomplishment. Moreover, I was pleasantly surprised by the ""crisp"" treble and the ""deep"" bass from these speakers, with some sound distortion though (as one would expect) at very high volumes. Bottom line, while you can definitely find PC speakers with more power output than these, what you will be hard pressed to get is the same or better ""sound quality"" than the Altec Lansing ATP3s. So, unless you really want to ""crank-up-the-volume"" while listening to music on your PC, you will be ecstatic by purchasing these fabulous looking and sounding speakers from Altec!"
2,Good if you just want to hear static!,"This is a horrible fm transmitter. I used this in my 2005 mazda 3 and I could not get the quality of the music to sound even close to good. It sounded like the radio had poor quality,and the music came in quiet, choppy, and statically. Not a good buy and I definitely would not recommend."
2,Two issues with this product!!,"Bought this as a gift for my daughter after reading many reviews. The FM reception was fine. Our problem is two fold. First is my daughter's only power outlet is flush on her dash and near her steering wheel and wiper control arm. It is a very tight fit. Make sure you have plenty of room if you chose this design. The BIG problem is she has an ipod video, the largest and heaviest ipod, and when she goes over any bumps the whole unit flies out of the socket!!! I contacted Griffin and they sent me a collar from a previous model and a new power arm and neither worked. I since know of a friend that has the same unit and has no problem. Make sure you try it as soon as you get it because you only have 30 days to return it. I bought it as a gift and the 30 days are done, so I'm stuck with it!!"
3,Older technology,"Charger doesn't support my wife's G4, works well for my classic. This is the older technology so you have to find new stations yourself as you drive in and out of range."
1,Thought this must be the one ...,"... but it's not. It's a nice, stylish design. Very sturdy and it is positive (and necessary) to have the option to dial in any frequency in the given range. However, music sounds muffled and audiobooks sound like muffled 'from outer space'. Does not work for me, just does not cut it because of the poor sound quality. This product may still be better than others because of the quality look and features. In my opinion this transmitter like others would have to be much stronger. So if your only alternative to singing the songs yourself is a FM transmitter, then this appears to be a good choice - if you expect for $50 more than 1930 radio quality, FM transmitters are not your way to go currently."
3,Not compatible with 2nd generation Nano,"Appearance-wise, this product is too bulky for a Nano, although it now ships with a Nano adaptor. Unfortunately, the adaptor does not fit the 2nd generation Nanos. This includes the new 8GB Nano. I wouldn't be rating this product if the description, either here or at [...], had warned me. Then again, it doesn't appear that there is an FM transmitter on the market that supports the second generation Nanos yet. To be fair, the only reason I found this out for this product is because it has such good reviews."
1,Piece of junk,"I purchased the Griffen looking for something easy to use with an ipod touch in the car. It initially worked pretty well except for the fact that the unit would swing back and forth when the car was turning. Not wanting to have the ipod hit the console regularly, I used black eletrical tape to keep it stable(The black tape matched the unit). That worked and I was fairly happy for a while. The problem that has now developed is that the unit will lose the radio station after 2 minutes of playing. I thought that it might be the vibration of the car ( I drive a nice car with a smooth ride) but I can be standing still and it will lose the station. At this point the unit is worthless. I am going to try to get my money back."
1,Awful!,"I have a brand new Toyota Corolla - I plugged this into my electrical outlet - only to find out it cannot easily be removed. I practically ruined my car trying to get it out! Do not purchase this - in addition, it has an awful reception - lots of static as other reviewers reported. Don't waste your money!"
3,Good Transmitter- bad mount,"So i got this for a 20 hour car ride to florida. The transmitter works great no problems with the signal. But the connector does not work with my ipod case protection - so i have to take that off every time i want to use this item. also the connection to the power plug falls out from bumps and shakes from driving long distances. overall it was worth the money, but i would recommend a top transmitting unit - from the head phone jack instead of this unit."
2,Don't waste your money,"I've given this gadget enough trial and error and am still unhappy with its quality. I have tried it in suburbs, rural no man's land and urban centers (I travel everyday all over the map for work) and it constantly let's me down. I read before that it transmits at a quality somewhere between FM and AM broadcast quality . . . It's definitely closer to AM in my opinion. Bass is totally gargled sounding and high end produces a very annoying mid-range that kills the best of my rock ipod tunes and minimizes all the immensity of Thelonius Monk and other Jazz monsters . . . don't waste your money, unless you enjoy the archaic sound of AM broadcast, which isn't so bad if you're listening to NEWS, but music, uh-uh, this transmitter is abhorable. Maybe there's nothing better out there, it seems like a difficult technology to master, but I guess I'll have to spend some more money in hopes of finding a more dependable transmitter. Thumbs down!"
1,Don't like RoadTrip.,"My husband and I bought the RoadTrip at the same time we bought our iPod in December, 2005. At the time it cost $90! It wasn't worth it AT ALL.It never stayed put in the outlet. No matter how securely we put it in, it always rolled to the side, thus disconnecting the iPod. If we encountered any sort of road that wasn't completely smooth (eg, railroad tracks), it would disconnect. THEN to top it all of, it COMPLETELY quit working after about 13 months - just over the factory warrenty. nice.I'd never give it another try and never recommend it to anyone else. Poor quality, even if the price has come down."
3,"Great Sound, But...","I can definitely say this product's sound is excellent; I have zero static. However, I need to turn the car volume up to maximum in order for the sound to be anywhere near acceptable (and I have perfect hearing, before anyone asks!).Only other annoyance is that for my iPod with Video, the ""holster"" part is too large, and the iPod slides back a bit while driving.Those are the only two negatives I have - As for positives, as mentioned above the audio is static-free, and that's the most important thing in my mind."
3,Griffin Road Trip Transmitter,"The product operates pretty much as described, but the downside of listening through the open FM frequencies on a car radio results in a greatly diminished quality of sound."
3,"Plays Great, but Doesn't Charge","I use the Griffin in two cars, a Subaru and a Honda Fit. It plays great and is pretty easy to use. My only problem is that contrary to the product information, when it is plugged into the outlet in either car, a message comes on the iPod Nano (8g) saying: iPod charging not supported on this accessory.What gives? Is there something I don't know?"
5,Great FM Transmitter and Charger (if you can get it for less than retail),This FM transmitter works well with both my 3G ipod nano and my 5G ipod classic. It comes with different attachments and they both fit very snuggly. I like this device over any other I have used because not only does it charge the ipod but it sits comfortably from the dock so that you dont have to manipulate it much to scan through mp3s.
5,EXCELLENT,THIS IS ACTUALLY THE SECOND ONE I HAVE BOUGHT. I BOUGHT ONE FOR MYSELF AND ONE FOR MY HUSBAND. IT WORKS GREAT!!! CRYSTAL CLEAR ONTO MY CAR SPEAKERS. I WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS PRODUCT.
3,Worth the money,"I bought almost every weight loss CD Amazon offers and this is one of the best. Some of the weight loss hypnosis CDs are really poor quality or they waste a lot of time on visualizations not related to weight loss, but this CD is really worth the money and I highly recommend it. So far I lost 40 pounds and have kept it off for ten months. Hypnosis is by far the easiest and most successful weight loss technique I've ever tried, and I've tried them all. For my other favorite weight loss and exercise music CDs from Amazon please see my listmania list."
2,Slowww...,"I have the 128M version of this card. It does not work at all in my high-end digital camera. The card must be the slowest, oldest technology on the market....I finally just through it away."
2,Cool product not worth the money,It was cool for a couple of weeks and then it has been on the shelf over a year. It works well and is fun for a couple of weeks.
4,Cooking With Hilarity,"Hamilton-Paterson flawlessly folds Into this souffle folded many ingredients seemingly disparate, resulting in hilarity and desire for more. Told in alternating voices, the plot soars hilariously. Marta, a composer from Eastern Europe, and Gerald, a ghost-writing ex-pat from England, live in mutual disharmony, misdirection and misunderstanding on a Tuscan hilltop. It helps, but is not necessary, for the reader to be somewhat knowledgeable about Pier Paolo Pasolini, East European mafia, gourmet cooking. Add to this, Boy Bands, UFOs, ghostwritten ""autobiographies,"" Italian filmmaking. Not since ""Somebody is Killing the Great Chefs of Europe"" have there been recipes of such escalating ludicrousness. Hilarious! I'm gratified to learn that there are at least two books that follow this one."
1,Beware the drivers...,"If your PC is only loading drivers for the printer, and not other things (AOL IM, Iomega Zip, etc.) it works great. However, it does overwrite other drivers and programs, forcing itself to be not only the printer driver, but also the monitor and Acrobat Reader. After a week (and weak) of (lack of) tech support, I returned it. Shame, it would have done all the things I wanted it to do. But bad tech support (I am pretty savvy in computer terms) and the large amount of programs loading into memory to make this thing run was too much for me."
5,The Caribbean awaits for romance!,"What a WONDERFUL guide to the Caribbean!! This specialized Frommer's Guide is not the usual travel book ... it delivers the romance part of the equation, as promised. Not only are the descriptions detailed enough to make some intelligent choices, the overall organization of the book is fantastic. And, the author's first-hand experience, over decades - not a few months, makes this a must have resource. I can't imagine going to the Caribbean without this in my bag!"
5,Young Thomas Edison,"This is one of my favorite classic films and this release is very good. So glad it has finally been released to DVD. I also orderded 'Thomas Edison the Man' and it was equally as good. If you like calssic films and the history of a great inventor, then you will also enjoy these films. As always, I am very satisfied with Amazon."
5,Great product,"I've always known Littman products when it comes to stethoscopes since this is what I've been using since I graduated in 91. Prestige Medical is somewhat new to me. I bought this product basing my decisions on the reviews I read here at Amazon and I'm glad I did. The weight is just right - not too heavy, not too light. And the acoustics on the bell is great, even better than my old Littman. This is a very good buy."
2,Uuugghhh....,"I'm a Cardiac ICU RN...this is my third stethoscope thanks to the cardiologists walking off with my stethoscope. I wanted quality but I'm tired of paying Littmann prices. I should have known better....The structure itself is off, its not symmetrical and I am constantly having to readjust so I can hear appropriately and the earpieces have fallen off three times in three weeks. The quality of sound is OK. I'll stick with this stethoscope until it walks away courtesy of another cardiologist and then I'm getting a Littmann"
1,Ugh....avoid this!,"This is a terrible copy of the movie! It appears to be a poorly transferred copy (possibly from an OLD VHS) and the quality is awful! Not only is the video terrible, the audio is too! If I could give a negative rating, I would do so. The movie deserves better as Richard Wright is one of the most visceral writers of the Harlem Renaissance."
5,an adventurous and experimental album from SWM!,"Shaolin Wooden Men are back with their forth studio album and their most adventurous and experimental to date, taking a on slightly different tangent than their first two techno influenced releases, S.W.M ('94) & The Hungry Forest ('96) and the latter 'Supermindway' (2000) where they ventured into a nu style of psychedelic electronic rock and receiving much acclaim from fans in Europe and Japan with its genre pushing sound.Clocking in at just over forty minutes 'A Binary input into flesh Antenna' sees SWM transmutate their love of sonic exploration even further into a new realm of avant garde psychedelic electronic voodoo punk rock, creating vast textures of digital and analogue soundscapes hoovering over a primal swamp beat, blurring the lines between machine and the rhythm of man....making it akin to nothing!."
5,Absolutely worth it!,Trust me I WAS NOT the guy who spent $150 on a pair of loafers until I bought these. Comfortable and long lasting. These are worth every nickel!
1,Problem w/ Manufacturing????,"I think I received a lemon too. I bought this same brand at a store and the fan was not mounted properly. I returned that one. I bought the same one here on Amazon and when I got it, I noticed that not much air was coming out. I looked from behind the unit and one of the fan blades was broken off. Returning the one I bought at Amazon back too. I definitely think it is not the retailers fault...it's a manufacturing/assembly defect/problem."
3,no good no bad,"I guess is ok for small rooms, in the amazon review says that is ok for any size of room but if you wanted for a well size room wont heat it up as good as the review said. I'd try to place couple of fans close to it, so the heat can spread out, otherwise will be useless"
5,The Best Ever!!!!,"I bought this DVD together with another one by Heemalaya's and BY FAR THIS IS THE BEST! It has a great and easy routine, in several Languages (which I love since I can practice Hindi, and can see it with my friends either in English or Spanish. Although more languages are available). Julia Casper is a very good dancer and not just an aerobics freak (which was my impression of Heemalaya's DVD). Therefore the movements are very graceful.It has 3 routines of great Bollywood songs and they all start with a warm-up, then she leads you little by little to all the beautiful steps... and she makes you sweat!!! (I barely sweat... until I did these routines). Then it is dancing time to Sharuk's music and finally the cool-down exercises. I LOVE THIS DVD. I hope they will produce more routines later on. ... and by the way, this DVD really has Bollywood music unlike the other one which pretends to... but has more a Westernized version of Bollywood."
3,Bollyrobics--forget the workout and have fun!!!,"This is a great dance/fitness DVD for an advanced student or an ambitious beginner. By the end of the 1st song (Maahi Ve), you WILL be sweaty, but smiling, because you will have learned a fun, energizing choreography. I had a lot of fun, and that was only the 1st song. You can choose which language to learn the dances in, and even choose no narrator for ""performance"" mode.I wish the production value was a little better, but you get used to the static camera angles, and green screen background. I also wish the DVD came packaged with the recommended silk ""veil."" The choreography for ""Maahi Ve"" would have made more sense if I'd had the veil to go with it. If you look inside the DVD cover, they give you a website to purchase their recommended size veil... after the fact.So, put a bindi on your forehead, channel your favorite Bollywood actress, and dance your way into fitness!Namaste,~;^) Bindi Beauty (^;~"
5,Great gluten-free snack item!,"I've been enjoying both the blueberry and the apricot bars by Orgran since I was diagnosed with Celiac disease 5 years ago. I think they're great with hot tea or coffee or even a cold glass of milk. Check out the nutrition labels: Reasonable in calories, very low fat and good fiber content (which is hard to get the recommended-daily-dose-of on a gluten free diet.)Denise Stevens"
1,what was received was NOT what was ordered,I expected the set to be what was pictured and it wasn't. This is apparently a different set; the tool we wanted is replaced with a different one. NOT happy!
3,A very brief story...,"I was expecting a book. This is more like a pamphlet. Maybe eighteen pages of text. It is definitly a short story. Not something I would expect sold on its own.It is worth reading. Crowley makes some great comments about the mind of the prohibitionist and their ilk. It is also a view of absinthe drinkers in New Orleans and not France.Useful for someone interested in the subject and is willing to spend money just to get the one piece. Beyond that, it seems a bit over price. (It was also interesting to see just how much packing material was used to ship it. Much more than the book actually weighed, by a factor of about ten.)"
5,"Very, very good printer","I own the HP Business Inkjet 2200se for almost a whole year and never had trouble with it. I have been using it on my PII-266 with Windows 2000 and it always worked well. I like this printer because it's very fast, the cost per page is very low (you will be surprised if you use it!!!!) and the print quality is excellent!!! I would recommend it to every one who wants a really good printer and can not or doesn't want to pay for a Color Laser. Buy it!"
1,THIS PRINTER IS A DOG!,"I purchased and installed this printer in my home office. The installation was done by my wife who is employed installing hardware and software. In short, the printer drivers in this printer are defective. As a result, although I could, occasionally, print a new document, it was impossible to print any existing documents. An e-mail to Hewlett Packard Technical Support was met with a nice, computer generated response telling me they would get back to me in two days.But, who on earth can wait two days without being able to print? Two days, to most businesses, is an eternity.If you're a small business person or anyone considering this product, run the other way as fast as you can. You will waste lots of time trying to make this machine do what you purchased it to do, PRINT!"
4,great product,"Great product, starts easy. I hardly rev it to the max, about halfway is all I need. my only con is when you extend the cutting line the blade to trim the line to size doesn't cut well. Not sure if it's dull or not but that's a minor complaint. Great product"
1,weedeater,We received this weedeater and after three days tryimg to keep it running we had to put it in the shop and they charged us $35.00. Too expensive to send it back and pay shipping again. Wont buy this type of item here anymore. should have worked from the beginning. we are very experienced with outdoor equipment but could not get it strated and keep it running.
1,Cheap and underpowered,"The only good thing I can say about this trimmer is that it starts easily, otherwise it's a cheap piece of crap! The engine is underpowered if you're going to use it for taller grass and weeds. The handle wont tighten enough and stay upright. The air filter cover always comes open and the filter falls out.I just learned it can't be returned to Amazon, so now I'm going to have to try to unload this thing on Craigslist. I paid $119 for it and I'll be lucky if I can get $40 for it after one use!"
3,Wondering,"Still testing- used four times - disappointed you have to pull several times before it starts-the second time I used would not continue running, had to restart several times, may have been caused by me not primming enough- followed instructions. Primmed 10 to 12 times and let run awhile the last time I used it and it did better."
2,Niot a Fan,I bought this a few years ago to replace the cheap Weed Wacker I got when we first moved here. I gotta say it was a pain in the butt to start and that to me is the most important thing when evaluating a power tool It got to the point where I dreaded this part of the job because nothing is more frustrating then pulling 8-10 times as you hope and pray that it will start. After a few seasons it broke and the repair was more than the unit was worth.Under advice of a co-worker I bit the bullet and got an Echo. Starts by the 3rd pull every time and I sure wish I wouild have done this the first time. I gave this tool 2 stars because one it started it worked very well.
4,One Season Review,I put in one season with this and have found it to work well. I also bought an edger attachment for it. It starts easily and has enough power to meet my needs.
1,Fragile joint and no way to return,"I enjoyed this the first couple of times I used it, but on my third use, the coupling that holds the trimmer to the shaft gave out and now the trimmer can't be connected to the main shaft. It makes sense that this joint would snap since it is a real pressure point on the machine. I contacted the manufacturer who told me to use an authorized repair service, but the two in my area don't want to work on it because they don't believe it is a manufacturer problem and they say it will cost me more than I paid for the machine. Amazon won't let me return it. If I had it to do over again, I would never have bought this from Amazon because getting the warranty honored is turning into a real problem. I think I'm out the money I spent for this and the extra attachment I bought. If I can save anyone else from being taken advantage of, then my work is done here."
1,Spins the wrong way,"The engine started on the first pull every time, but the head spins counter clockwise. The way I trim, that puts the debris coming right back at me. I couldn't change so I sold it and bought the Ryobi."
2,Buddha - Christ Connection,"I've read other books by the author but was disappointed with this because I was expecting much more. I wanted something showing the parallel between the two beliefs and got a coffee table book with pretty pictures and some quotes that were saying the same concept. There is a much larger connection between what these two spiritual leaders taught, but you won't find it in this book."
1,Book description is wrong,"""Employed by Russian shepherds to protect the flocks from predators""Georgian Shepherd dog also known as Caucasian shepherd or nagazi is a Georgian breed not Russian,Breed was taken to Soviet Russia after second World war.please change description."
2,Keep your head up!,It's a great read but it really needs to be edited and fine tuned. The author got his point over very well. I'm still in your corner and I will still support you. For your next book please get it edited and fine tune and you will be the next best selling author.ReviewerBig Time Publishing magazine
2,good political analysis -- too breathless...,"I liked this book for its analysis of political phenomena. However, I found it weak on issues facing companies today in China or that the new business economy has created: There was little or no discussion of the institutional problems facing China in its transition. The journalistic background of the author also peeked through and some sections were too breathless for me. I disagree with the simplistic conclusion (among others) that water and pollution are the two major problems facing companies operating in China."
5,Babe in a Manger reveiw,I liked this book because it was a good story written and illistrated well! I think many people would enjoy this book from start to finish and it would be wonderful to read to little children around Christmas or just anytime.
1,Too hard,"I have a few of the other Esquire-Dance Away videos and I really enjoy working out to them. The dance steps are simple and follow an aerobic workout style, the instructions are easy, and they are fun to do. This video is nothing like those others. It's very hard to follow. The dance steps are ridiculously hard and only for devoted dance students. Sure it gets your heart pumping, but not if you can't follow anything they are doing. You just stand there looking dumb founded watching the girls on TV dance. Don't waste your money unless you are an expert dancer and already know how to do the moves they claim to teach you."
1,Corrs have become porr,"I used to love the Corrs, until I bought Borrowed Heaven. They've become too Americanized for this Ami's taste. I liked their Irish roots, which seemed to fall off for this album. They were my favorite band, but now they're not."
2,Not Like Their Other Albums,"This album had more of a pop sound than their other albums. Their Celtic sound was a little less here and their was an atempt at pop, but it doesn't work for the Corrs."
5,Very very enjoyable - a great piece to their stellar discography,"I can't believe I missed this album when it was released in 2004. I'm a big fan of the Corr's traditional Irish sounds, and find it hard to get tired of them. Their unique family arrangement and heritage really inspire and intrigue me. I enjoyed this album quite a lot, and am glad I found it,as I'd hate to have it missing from my collection. The first three songs are very catchy and quick paced before they slow it down a bit with ""long night"". Of course, I'm always looking for their instrumental, and I wish there was more than one here, but the one included ""Silver Strand"" is very good, though it isn't any ""Erin Shore"" (if you haven't heard that one, go get their first album!). Overall, a great collection of pop songs with a little Irish mix."
5,Heavenly Transfixes You,"After having their hit `Breathless' became a number one single selling in 15 countries four years ago, the siblings are back with a more religious and mature album, slightly back to their original Irish root which was absent in the previous album `In Blue'. The album title song `Borrowed Heaven' is a collaborative project with South African's Ladysmith Mambazo, attempts touching our spiritual side with its simple but thoughtful lyrics, reminding our innocent presence in the world and its materials that are yet to be given back to God. The optimistic 'Angel' and 'Goodbye', a blend of rock and classical violin, canvas their emotions toward their late mother who died of cancer. With the majority of equally phenomenal tracks, the foursome's unwise choice came after deciding the blandly misleading and shallow `Summer Sunshine' as their first single and an opener of `Borrowed Heaven'."
2,HP 2500...has many problems,"The HP 2500, while a good printer, is in the midst of several quality control problems. Several problems have occurred with the 9 that we have. Ink systems reading levels incorectly, squeaking components, and slow network printing. Print quality does not appear to be a problem. However, the many bugs in these HP printers still need to be worked out. HP has acknowledged the problems and at present do not have a fix for them. However, I am sure that they will in the future. If you do not need wide paper capability, I would suggest the HP 2250TN."
3,Ehh....,"GTA is a series that has always been talked about for years in my various circles of friends, so I finally got a chance to start with this one, it did not live up to what I expected, the concept is still interesting but I dont think it is very well executed, turning around corners is like trying to turn a boat, this is especially irritating when trying to get away from cops even more so in the rain, in the beginning it seems most everyone has a weapon but you, at the end of the day I dont think this is really my type of game, thats why I gave it a 3"
4,Great game,There's not much I can say that hasn't been said better already but I'll give a quick list of my top good and bad points about the game.Good:-Graphics-Pure fun factor-Tons of missions-MultilayerBad:-Repetition-Some unfair missions-In game friend system is annoying/pointlessOverall worth playing. Not the best game ever but definitely great.
5,GTA IV,"Overall, this game is one of the best I have ever played. Unfortunately, you can't really replay it over and over again, but after you beat the game, you can still interact with Liberty City. Some of the missions you can't get by without cheating (at least with my style of playing), but it is still a great game."
4,Good overall game.,GTA 4 is a good game. you can do many things that are just so much fun to just screw around. there are darts bars etc. if your not willing to play missions you can do pretty much whatever you want. this game is a must have game for xbox 360 owners if you want to just drive around and have fun.
2,Game Constantly Freezes,"This would be an otherwise 5 star game if it weren't for the fact the game constantly freezes (purchased the special edition for the XBOX 360). I can go through no more than 1 mission before the game freezes. Then after the first freeze, it freezes constantly every 10-15 minutes. It's not the XBOX because all other games work fine.I have contacted Rockstar and they have not replied and there is no patch to download. Buy the game, but play it immediately so you can test it and exchange if you have to within 30 days. I waited a while to start playing it because I was already playing 2 other games and now it's too late to exchange.If you can find a game that doesn't freeze, you will have at least a 4 star experience."
2,MAJOR DISSAPPOINTEMENT,I THOUGHT THIS GAME WAS GONNA UPGRADE ALOT OF THINGS.. I MEAN DONT GET ME WRONG IT WAS BETTER IN GRAPHICS AND CERTAIN LITTLE DETAILS SUCH AS THE MOST WRECKED CARS BACK FIREING AND SUCH.. BUT IT REALLY SUCKED THAT IT TOOK CAR CUSTOMIZATION OUT I WAS EXPECTING IT TO UPGRADE A WHOLE LOT MORE IN MY OPINION.BUT IF U PLAN ON PURCHASING THIS GAME I WOULD ADVISE U WAIT TIL SAINT ROW 2 KOMES OUT I KNOW FOR A FACT GTA IS GONNA REVISE THERE WHOLE STRATEGY WHEN THEY SEE WHAT SAINTS ROW 2 IS WORK WITH LOL..
1,Don't Believe the Hype,"I read many positive reviews of this game and was convinced to purchase it. I played it for several hours and lost interest. It has got to be about the worst story ever written for a video game. The characters are all shallow and not at all interesting. The gameplay is slow and repetitive, to the point where you feel like you are doing the same boring tasks again and again... oh wait, you are. The driving portion of the game becomes annoying very quickly... there is no realism."
2,Not what i expected,to be honest i didn't like it at all very short not the best graphics over all pretty bummed out not worth the price and not worth the trade in price either
3,Glad I rented!!!,"This game isn't really what I expected. It's a good game, don't get me wrong but I was expecting to be addicted for at least a month just playing this game exclusively. I'm not sure if I'm going to finish playing it. I get bored playing after just an hour. The graphics aren't really that good. Everything seems dull. The cars are really difficult to turn even at a moderate speed. If you barely tap the handbrake the cars will just spin out of control. The camera seems to have a mind of its own. If the game gets updated and fixes some of these problems then I might enjoy it more. I just have very little patience and when I'm just trying to drive around and my car flips over from hitting a curb driving slow then I get very irritated. I like Saints Row a lot more and when Saints Row 2 comes out this game will be long forgotten for me."
2,Worst entry into the series.,"There was so much hype surrounding this game, and it just fell sooooo short from expectations.Lets start with the main problems,All the customization options from GTA: San Andreas are gone. No more bike ridding, bodybuilding, haircuts, tattoos, stamina, underwater swimming, Airplanes, parachuting,Car customizing.Its essentially GTA 3 with better graphics and storyThe developers said this stuff ""wasnt possible"" in this game. Which is complete bull, if its was possible in the previous game then why is not possible in this game with superior console power?Onto the Online play.Its So-So, nothing exciting. Some interesting gametypes, but the aiming system is pretty bad. People dont die if you plow into them with a car at full speed.All enemies,friendlies,and weapons show up on radar making it pretty cluttered.More of a rental if you ask me."
2,Case came broken and in tatters,"the only reason this got a two, is because the came came broken in multiple places, otherwise it was a good purchase and the disc worked great"
1,Confusing and not FUN,"I bought this on a gamble, thinking it would be fun to play, but it is confusing with very little documentation on the game play. I am done with Rockstar Games."
3,GTA 4 's okay...,The graffics and the characters don't disappoint you actually feel like you in nyc cause of how the flawlessly got the personalities of every ethnic group. the down side to this game is the story line is really short... and if i was buying this game when it first came out for $50-$60 i would be upset... however since i paid under $20 for this title then its good value for money
3,Wish I wouldn't have given in to my son's request,"This was a ""bought it because everyong else had"" purchase. Great parents, friends of mine had gotten it for their kids. It's such a popular game and fun game for the kids to play. Of all the children I knew who played it, I had heard that some were not allowed to (go into the strip clubs, etc.) I finally gave in. Thought I would try the same tactics of ""controlling"" different scenes/places he would be allowed to go, so he wouldn't be so exposed. WHAT WAS I THINKING!!???!! Every day was a shocker. He would say he was killing the cops, blah, blah, blah. Just a lot of unethical, violent things where his position is the bad guy. I just don't like it. My fault. I shouldn't have given in to the popularity of the game and what my friends and their kids were all doing. They are regretting it just as much!"
1,Didn't work,"I bought a used one, in ""like-new"" condition and my xbox didnt even recognize the disk. Had to return it."
2,GTA Letdown Again,"Well I was eagerly anticipating Grand Theft Auto 4 ever since it was announced. I have been playing GTA since the very first game and nearly every game has been better than I could have imagined, however, GTA San Andreas came out and that was just a ghetto clone of GTA Vice City. And now we have the same game as San Andreas with better graphics and cut scenes but with the same horrible camera angles and camera control. So thank you Rockstar Games for making an awesome game with a piece of junk camera that makes the game worthless. I think I will just wait for the game to come out for on PC, if it ever does, so i can play GTA the way it was meant to be played, with a mouse and keyboard."
1,This sux,This person never sent me the game. I bought it b4 xmas and I still havn't gotten it! What a rip off
5,BUY IT.,You will not be dissapointed. i have put in hundreds of hours and it is still my favorite game.IF YOU BUY: THE TWO THINGS YOU MUST DO1. TURN ON SUBTITLES. MAKES IT SOO MUCH EASIER2. BUY THE BALLAD OF GAY TONY ADD ON. AMAZING
2,Xbox games,Fun if you enjoy this types of games. Some violence in it that can be control but still violent and sometimes with no apparent reason
2,Size is important,"I've purchased three pair of Crocs over the past few years, and I love them. They are undoubtedly the best sandal out there. Comfort is incomparable. Usually though, when you choose size 10, for example, what you receive is a generic size 10/11/12, and they are so marked. This time however, size 10 meant size 10, which is slightly short...even compared to all my shoes and other sandals, which are size 10. This made this pair of Crocs uncomfortable. Because they are kind of expensive, adding a return shipping fee makes the cost very much on the high side. So, I decided to keep them. Maybe they'll stretch....if not, I'll give them away. Bottom line; disappointed. Be sure you contact the seller to confirm the ""actual"" size before you buy.SEE THEM HERE:http://www.amazon.com/crocs-10042M-Crete-Flip-Flop/dp/B001KZHRPA/ref=pd_sim_dbs_shoe_10"
3,Nice to have this collection . . . but . . .,"My wife loves the stories and the wonderful characters and actors. I try to discourage her from watching on our projection screen and limit her viewing to the under 60"" plasma. Larger presentations only highlight the problem with these fairly low quality transfers from VHS to DVD. When you consider the quality of video images that can be provided by many other TV/movie series from the 1980s, this collection ought to be an embarrassment for A&E. Couldn't spend a few dollars and provide a cleaner and sharper image, eh?"
1,A big disappointment,This book does not deliver on the expectations built by the initial Balanced Scorecard articles. It does very little to clarify and structure the concept and approach to building a Balanced Scorecard. There are a few interesting ideas but they get lost in a repetitive and hard to read text.
2,hour hand is off,"When it is 3:00 for example, the hour hand is half way between the 2 and the 3. Otherwise watch is fine."
4,Censored 1999 is a beginner's resource to neglected news,"Censored 1999 is a great resource for learning about the atrocities that corporate media overlooks. However, none of the articles present enough information; articles involving the death of millions of people, big money corporate scandals, and other major issues are usually given 2-3 pages. While Censored 1999 provides resources where the reader can get more information on these topics, the book itself has too much breadth and too little depth. This can hardly be blamed on Censored 1999, though; if the media itself did a better job of covering the real issues, then all of 1999's news wouldn't have to be crammed into a single book. Censored 1999 is a necessary index to the real issues, but if you want the full story you'll still have to do most of the research yourself."
3,chime alarm clock,"I have seen these clocks advertised for a few yearsght but had never seen one. I ordered the clock because I thought chimes would be a nicer way to wake up plus I've never seen one in anyones home and I like unique things. I have to say that I was quite disappointed when I recieved the clock because it is so much smaller than I thought, it only runs by batteries ( no a/c cord) and its a really cheesey way to make the chimes sound. Top that off with how difficult it is to set the clock, the alarm, etc. even with the instructions which are very confusing. I did not send it back but again, a great disappointment."
2,Cheap,"Technically this clock works, and the chime does work. It is a cheap little thing (obviously at the price) and is difficult to program. If you ever lose the manual, good luck. Although it works as advertised, I would buy something of better quality next time."
1,Cheap,"This is an excellent product idea, but this product isn't excellent. It's very cheaply made and the controls are cumbersome. Most people don't need an alarm clock that tells them the day of the week, the month or the year. The first time I set the alarm it didn't go off. The chimes sound nice but they hit a flimsy little metal bar that gives you a tapping sound along with the chimes. Again, this is a great idea but this is a poor product. Also, not sure why this is being rated as a toy, it's an alarm clock."
4,"animal instincts, how true","yet another good read from Titchmarsh. there is a lovelly freshness, dreamy feel to this book, and is difficult to put down. there is hardly a page that goes by that doesn't set your mind tingling, after all haven't we all been in such situations before."
1,AVOID THIS DRIVE!,"Bought this about a year ago for the business, and it has been slowly dieing a painful death by bad power supply for the past three months. QPS is no help on-line and there is no toll-free number to call them up on. Of course the pitiful warranty is expired as well, and I don't have time for this foolishness.Makes a nice EXPENSIVE paperweight I suppose."
1,"DOES NOT WORK WITH WINDOWS ME, 98 or below","Said it worked with WIN ME, 98 and other formats and it does NOT...Also no drivers available and the QPS customer service stinks(basically none)......Don't buy this..."
5,5-Series Service Manual,"I must say that although it took longer than was expected to arrive, once I received the manual, it was worth the wait.This book covers everything one would need to know about items that either the novice (like myself) or mechanic would like to fix.The pictures, the expanations are done extremely well, and I have followed them and fixed items that I thought were going to cost me and arm and a leg at BMW......Get this book if you have any mechanical ability and prepare yourself for saving money!!!!PS: Some of the things I have fixed myself are ones that my dealership said would have to be replaced, wrong..... the only thing that had to be replaced were bulbs at a cost of less than $3.00, instead of the entire module costing $250.00."
3,Explanation without assistance,"First comment: Flog the editor. Perhaps the cumbersome and confusing writing-style was intentional; however, I fear that it was merely sloppy.Second comment: Having AS myself, I was hoping for insights into coping and avoiding pitfalls. Instead, what I got was a chronicle of another couple's fumbles, stumbles and misunderstandings. I suppose the book lived up to its title; it never promised that it contained solutions or recommendations, merely that it was about An Asperger Marriage. I am still surprised by Tony Attwood's endorsement of this book.Summary: If you want a peak into the lives of one ""Asperger Marriage"", this book may be for you. If, on the other hand, you're looking for advice and guidance, keep looking. (and let me know when you find it!)"
1,DONOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS ITEM!,"I thought I would like the Dyson but after 4 years let me tell you how my vacuum lasted or didn't last.After 2 years I was carrying the vacuum up by the handle and it broke. Cutting my hand with sharp pieces of plastic. To replace the piece it cost me $125.00. Sorry not under warranty!Everytime I vacuum which is once a week, my vacuum looses pieces of plastic.Now at almost 4 years old, I can not use it anymore.The hose is connected thru the handle that you push. After years of removing the handle to clean stairs and dust on walls the 2 little pieces of cheap plastic that keeps the handle to the vacuum have worn out and you cannot push the vacuum since the hndle does not stay in place.I have recently bought a Hoover with a cyclone. The removable hose is connected to the side which makes it easier to clean corners and edges where carpet meets the wall. Not to mention I will always be able to push it without the handle falling off the vacuum unit."
3,Better than most but ......,"I have the Dyson Animal. It does suck up the dirt really well. But the filter chamber can get caked with dust and dirt. Those tiny holes have to be scraped off at times. (by hand) I do not like bagless vacuums as a whole because of all the dust. A bag keeps it contained and less gets in the air. Altho the Dyson empties easy, if you have to reach into the filter and clean some of the caked dirt either on the holes or in the chamber it is awful....It does do a good job of cleaning a rug , but I will probably go back to a bag and hepa filter next time. The dyson is also heavy. Most good vacuums do have some weight, but you should be aware of that if you cannot handle a heavier vacuum.It's better than some vacuums I've had, but I think the hype for this machine is probably a little too much. This is a Good vacuum and seems to do a good job. But so do many other vacuums for this kind of money. I will look a bit more next time."
2,"i bought into the ""hype""",...and hyped this vacuum is! i actually just sold it on craigslist because i hated it so much...it made me feel like an idiot everytime i used it.First of all some of the attachments dont even really fit the wand (powerbrush).The rotating brush completely destroyed on of my area rugs since you cannot adjust the height (that's what they call automatic...which isnt really anything)When the rotation is turned off for hardwood floor it doesnt really suck anything up.It's really heavyYou have to uncoil the entire cord to use the wand...even for just a spot clean.Really there's so many better vacuums out there...maybe even a better Dyson...this one's just really poorly planned and designed.
5,"Best vacuum I've ever used - I have dogs, cats, birds & kids","I've never left a review before but this vacuum is so great I felt compelled to. To be able to vacuum the carpet and then roll off onto the tile and keep going is a dream come true. My other vacuums always threw stuff everywhere when I tried to vacuum on the tile so I had to switch to a broom or stick vac. I can get under the bird cages and get any cobwebs in corners all at once - oh yeah - forgot that I can also grab that darn cat hair that gets behind doors and on baseboards, with this vacuum it only takes seconds. I hate cleaning so I love being able to do everything with one machine. Emptying the bin is a breeze too. I've also never had a vacuum where the attachments were so easy to use.Hope this helps someone!"
4,Does what is supposed to do VACUUM!,"I will recommend this vacuum, worth the price. Being a previous owner of a Hoover, this surpass it by leaps. With hoover I have to pass a speck of dirt 2 to 3 times but with Dyson, dirt is all gone in 1 pass.Cons: poor instruction manual, you have to figure out where goes what and what that attachment is made for.- you have to take off all the power cord if you want to use the attachement"
2,Poor Customer Service,"The vacuum itself works very well. It sucks up everything. I do wish the attachments would stay attached to the vacuum when they are not in use.When you need service, watch out! Customer service is very unprofessional, unless their job is to say ""no."" I had a problem with the motor and the vacuum was very loud. After spending several hours and putting about 100 miles on my car, I finally was sent to a UPS store that would send it back as customer service described. When it came back from the Dyson service center damaged, I had to pay to fix the damage, as it wasn't a ""manufacturing defect."" I had to hang up on the supervisor because I couldn't handle being interrupted and yelled at any longer. I don't think she let me finish a complete sentence in the 10 minutes I was on the phone with her. Very frustrating.If you buy it, hope it doesn't break."
4,Dyson dc 17,"I'm retired and decided that since I do most of the housework, my wife still works.The vacuum that we had just wasn't getting the job done.So after some research I decided that the Dyson was what I wanted after talking the matter over with the boss she agreed with me and we bought the Dyson.I am very impressed with this vacuum and could not believe the amount of dirt and hair that our other vacuum had left in the carpet.We have a small dog and the hair that the Dyson picked up was amazing.The carpet now is so much cleaner and looks much better.This is a great vacuum and would recommend it to anyone.I have a Oreck xl that I would like to sell."
2,"For $550, I expect a little better quality","I have cats, two domestic longhairs and a Siamese. When they started shedding the the spring of last year ( 2007) I bought my ""animal"" It does have great suction IF you keep the filter clean. After you empty the dust container be sure the rubber collar makes a good seal with the bottom of the dust container, otherwise the filter will clog in only a few minutes. The cyclones do fill with dust and there isn't an easy way to clean them. I have soaked it in water and Is seems to have done some good, but it would be nice if you could disassemble it for cleaning.The beater brush housing is cheap plastic and broke when I hit the fringe on my oriental rug. Should the belt ever break it will be near impossible to replace. The little channel the belt runs in stays full of dust.It will go under only the highest furniture."
1,A BIG disappointment,I have owned the DC07 model for a number of years and would rate it 5 stars plus. So when I went to purchase another vacuum I thought this would be as least as good. While the vacuum will always have suction no matter what there are times when something gets clogged and reduces the amount of suction. On the DC07 it is very easy to remove parts to see where the problem was. Not true of this model. It is difficult or even impossible to remove most things. There is also at least one part that has a very cheap piece of plastic in it that breaks easily. I would be very reluctant to purchase another Dyson.
2,I'm one of the few who doesn't love this product,"I bought this product after a lot of people RAVED about it. I find it cumbersome, inefficient, and I ALWAYS have to clean out the spinner brush. I do have a golden retriever who sheds like crazy, but I thought my cheap vacuum surpassed this one by far. It is also very awkward for stairs and hard to reach places. I found this to be a waste of money, and would gladly take my cheaper vacuum any day of the week."
1,Worthless,"I remember hibachi cooking from the 60s. I remember my Father had a small one. And it worked great.Too bad this thing is a piece of junk.All other hibachis have a method of circulating and controlling air-flow to permit optimal cooking. Not THIS piece of junk. If you want to start a charcoal brickette you'd better do it somewhere else. As you can't start it in THIS piece of junk.Furthermore, if you want to actually cook anything on it. It had better not be 'wet', as in a piece of teriyaki chicken. What little heat coming off the brickettes will be doused by any drippings.It may be great for making s'mores, or warming your coffee, but anything else? Give it up.I'll add that if Amazon were honest about this piece of junk, they'd have shown a full-disclosure series of shots indicating it had not air-flow control system.Being a tad more familiar with the physics of fire, I'd have recognized that this product was a loser from the get go and saved myself the money."
3,SOMEWHAT FLIMSY,"I PURCHASED THIS BRUSH FOR WASHING MY MOTOHOME AS WELL AS MY CAR. THE BRUSH PORTION IS OKAY, BUT THE POLE FEELS LIKE IT WOULD BREAK EASILY WITH PRESSURE. I WILL NOT BE USING IT ON MY MOTORHOME. FOR THE PRICE IT SHOULD BE MORE STURDY."
3,Loose bristles and poor angle design,"My first use of the brush was to wash the minivan. Quite a few blue bristles came out of the brush. When I used the brush to wash the side of the garage still more bristle fell out. I am concerned just how long this brush will last. It is off to a poor start.The angle of the brush is not well designed. For those times you want to reach with the brush and the extension is fully out only the last row of bristles rub the surface. You can stand back from the surface you are trying to wash about 4 feet so the angle is better, but then you aren't able to reach very far with the brush. It would be much better to have the brush set at a 25 degree angle rather than the 45 degree angle as designed and produced."
4,"Great Product, but crappy O-ring","This is a great brush for washing my car, especially my minivan's roof. I wish there was a way to have it dispense soapy goodness, because then it'd be perfect. I mostly use this just for the final rinse/scrub on my car after I've already soaped it down. When I'm first washing my car, instead I just use my power hose because this brush's hose is not that strong. It shoots a wide spray instead of a stream.My major complaint about this is that the O-ring that comes with the brush was horrible. The O-ring is the piece of Rubber shaped like an 'O' that goes on the inside tube of the brush that connects to the hose. A bad O-ring causes water to leak and spray around the handle because the connection is poor. I had to cannibalize an old hose to get a good O-ring out of it for this brush. It's a small complaint, but come on, why wouldn't they spend the extra 30 cents to give us a good O-ring?"

2,Review of Bionaire Digital Dual Technology Heater,"I am very disappointed with this heater. It sounded like a great product. I needed something to use occasionally in our family room which is located in our basement and thought this might be the perfect item. Upon using it however, I found that little heat is produced by it and the temperature never got above 67."
3,Garden Nozzle,"Great shipping time. So far the nozzle works great, time will tell how it holds up to normal use."
2,Fire Hose Nozzle that won't put out many fires,"The product feels quite sturdy and is ergonomically nice but the quality of the product does not hold up. After 4 months of owning the product and using it to water flowers etc, it broke. It won't shut off and it won't go through all the spray cycles. It's the first hose nozzle that I've ever had fail in less than a year. Would not repurchase this product and would not recommend it."
5,You are there!,"I reckon the version of Blue n Boogie from disc 3 is a great demonstration as to what I love about jazz. High energy, humour, badass vibes...Bud Powell is at the centre, delivering searing statements whether comping or soloing. You are almost in the nightclub, but think the Royal Roost collection is slightly better hi-fidelity, and does not have strings. I don't think the Roosts have Powell or Navarro though. Strings and Roundabouts!"
4,Does anyone know the size/weight limitations?,"I don't own this item, but I think I want to. Does anyone know the size and weight limitations? Or can they be made for adult males? Thanks."
2,Not worth the price,These blocks looked better in the picture. They are made of cardboard and are fairly insubstantial for the money.
1,Useless,"This heater failed totally for me. Once programmed, it took only minutes for it to start flashing/vibrating and very little heat came out. Then it shut off all together.I own another oil filled heater and it works great...thought this one would be a good bargain for a second heater. I was very wrong. Now I am in the process of returning it. What a disapointment. Would not recommend this product."
3,"standard casebook, no real fireworks!","This casebook contained all the usual cases that are typical in a patent law/intellectual property casebook. Unfortunately, there should have been more content which described the patent process as well as the patent prosecution procedure in order to allow the reader to fit the case law into the appropriate scheme of things."
3,Seems to aid in hair loss,"Even though this product is chock full of herbs with questionable efficacy, it does seem to slow down hair loss a bit. This formula will not help you regrow hair though (nothing on the market will). I had to stop using it after awhile because it irritated my scalp. Also, because of the natural formulation it wont keep as well as other products."
3,This is a book you have to set down and take a break from,"I have read many fiction WWII spy stories and thought it would be neat to get the real story on Canaris. This thing kind of reads like a difficult history book. I would suggest you get this ONLY if you are REAL serious about learning about him because it gives tons of trivial details, etc."
3,"Been there, done that","Rehash of Inside the Criminal Mind with an obsessive bent on saying it's NOT the fault of the family or society that a criminal has developed. Then Samenow goes on to explain how family and society can prevent the development of an antisocial personality! He then explains how his methods of rehabilitation are the only methods that work. Seems to me if rehab can be accomplished by society, then prevention can also be accomplished by society. Samenow has trouble not contradicting himself over and over. As this book is but a poor restatement of his earlier book, skip this one and get Inside the Criminal Mind instead. Pat Brown/Director/Investigative Criminal Profiler/The Sexual Homicide Exchange, Inc."
2,Thirsty,"It is a fun read, but was a let-down as it was not as broad as I would have liked. Chronologically, it jumps from Scipio Africanus (c. 200 BC) to Ghenghis Khan (c. 1200 AD) with nothing in between. That is almost a millenium-and-a-half of commanders and battles! How can one ignore Belisarius or Charles Martel?"
4,Great Commanders very well done,"This is an informative book that can be read easily by an unschooled armchair general. It uses graphics of the battle scenes of Alexander, Scipio, Gustavus, Marlborough, Wellington, Rommel, MacAurthur, Napoleon, Slim, Henry V, Genghis Khan, Allenby, Washington, Lee, and others. It is a MUST have, and the introduction is a well done piece by General Sir John Hackett, an experienced soldier of the British Army, who has his own book own World War III. A warning though, it is exceedingly British. It is bias towards Britain in every battle involving the English, but this aspect is at worst evaluation a bit funny."
1,text book?,i got this book hoping to know the real Ritchie. its more like a text book with the breaking down of all of his music. the writing is terrible and it sounds like anyone could say anything about how CLOSE they were to Ritchie and she wrote it in as fact.
5,Stunning,"Through the lens of Hans Zak, through the finesse and strength of Alex Huber, through the eyes of legendary climbers such as John Long and Lynn Hill, this absolutely stunning book of photography and historical narrative is a must have for anyone interested in Yosemite's awe-inspiring walls and the adventurers who climb them."
3,"Historically interesting, but hard to follow","This is supposed to be the ""Euclid"" of number systems, but its unclear symbol definitions and cryptic proofs make it a fairly useless curiosity. The author claims that a ""normal"" student can get through it in two days, without knowing any high school mathematics. You could only do this if you aren't a critical reader of mathematics.I'm glad it is published and available, but the chain of proof weakens at various points. I find it very difficult to believe that some of the other reviewers did more than skim the book."
5,One of Harrow's better books,"I truly have to say that this is just one of the best books from Harrow. This book is a true must have if you a looking for the ""how to"" section in pagan ethics. This book will teach how to be a ""better"" mentor to students who are in the coven and how to look for better ""teachers"". However, everybody teaches differently than another person, but, this book has great advice and truly cannot be overlooked. Highly recommended !"
4,Charlie Barnet compendium,"Nice selection of Barnet instrumentals from the mid-30s to the miid-50s. In particular, it contains almost all of the ""best"" stuff from the 1939 band before Billy May left to join Glenn Miller. Well worth the budget price."
1,Stay away,Here is the thing:-Bad acting-Weak script-Very low budget-Too cheasy-The american character has a british fake accentPlease rent before buying
1,Disappointed,A relationship in prison between two inmates. They have to meet on the side and do their thing. I heard there was an X rated version of this movie which would probably be better than this version that was lacking.
2,Oz it ain't!,"The editorial calls this movie a german style ""Oz"". Well, they both take place in a prison, but that's where the similiarities end. ""Oz"" has talented actors, imaginative story lines, high quality production. ""Lock Up"" has penises!The movie looks like it was filmed with a camcorder the director borrowed from his mom. As for the actors, I can imagine the casting director going to a Berlin leather bar one Saturday night and saying, ""Who wants to be in a movie""?The annoying thing about this film is that whether you're looking for a good story line, or hoping for a bit of gay porn, you're going to be frustrated either way. It would probably suit a closeted married guy who can claim that ""It's just a german art movie"" should his wife find it hidden in his sock draw."
3,Not really worth it...,"I bought this as I thought all three movies would be worth watching and boy was I wrong. The only one of the three that is worth it is Exposed: The Making of a Legend, which is a documentary on the making of Buckleroos. It is well made, funny and has a wonderful insight into the world of gay porn and how it is made.The other two movies were pretty appalling - softcore porn that didn't really do much. Sure, the men were kinda hot but really, it doesn't go far enough to make it porn and the acting is appalling enough to be porn!Locked Up has some interesting moments but the characters are bad, the story was kinda shallow and the Mike character (and the actor himself - as seen in the cast interviews) is really annoying.The Hole can be deemed as kinda funny but, yet again, the acting was bad and I guess perhaps the 'hardcore' version, if there is one, would've been more fulfilling.All in all, I recommend buying Exposed on its own and ignoring the other two."
2,Oz Lite,"Shot on digital video with a budget that might buy you a nice lunch, Locked Up is a by-the-numbers story. There wasn't a plot point you couldn't see coming, even if you haven't seen Oz. While everyone involved gets full marks for trying, this is only one or two steps above an amateur effort--not a bad effort, but amateur none-the-less. The predictable script aside, the other element that really robs it of any punch is the fact that all the punches are so badly performed. With the exception of the shower scene, the violence is badly performed, so what is supposed to be brutal comes across as amusing. I can't say that I really hated this movie (Marcel Schlutt has enough charisma to carry the film), it's not one that I would recommend to anyone--not because it's out and out bad, but becuase it's not really good.(C)2005 Joe Edkin."
4,Must see,It was very refreshing to watch a gay movie that actually had gay actors. The movie had an interesting plot which was believable. There were only two things that I considered to be on the downside - a black American in a German prison. The second being that after watching the interviews with the stars realized that they had actually had sex this movie should have been rated XXX and went ahead and shown the actual sex scenes. This is what happens in prisons and the character Denis apparently wanted nothing to be cut out of this movie. I have watched this movie at least 20 times.
2,Not for dogs that chew,"When I first got the box, I loved it. It looks great and my dog (a rottweiler puppy) loved it too. She would run over to the box and get toys out she wanted. We have only had the box 2 weeks, and she has already chewed a small hole in the side - it is filled with foam. I had about 100 pieces of little foam scattered all over my floor and the box is no longer useable. It is really cute, but if you have a dog who likes to chew anything, this is not the toy box for you."
3,looks cool,"wanted to cut down the extreme amount of red when your look at the back of the truck. installed this and im happy with it. seems to be made of decent quality but it isnt made in the US. Led's went out and just the third brake light works now, so whatever."
4,Definately a textbook,"No one can dispute that Boadt knows his stuff -- and, though at times readers may find themselves praying for distractions, ""Reading"" is an excellent learning tool. Easy reference use, as well."
2,A wealth of information with poor theology.,"In what has become typical of modern study of the Bible, Lawrence Boadt has written a book that is filled with a wealth of information that will help a reader understand the Old Testament while constantly undermining the very reason that a person would seek to read it. Boadt assumes that God has had little or nothing to do with the writting of the Scripture, and apparently the cultures that surounded Israel were the true source of inspiration. While there is much in this book that is useful (and thus it is a two star book and not worthy of a mere single star) there is a great deal of theological garbage through which one must wade to find it."
5,Bonnie Bramlett: It's Time/Lady's Choice,"What can I say: It's Bonnie. Double CD of two of her 1970s albums, It's Time and Lady's Choice. 10 out of 10"
1,Avoid this piece of junk like the plague...,"Incredibly mediocre, this drive is as bad as the ZipDrive was good. Why do I hate this drive- let's see... It's very unreliable, producing more coasters than readable disks. The lack of Burnproof technology means a lot of buffer underrun errors, even when burning at a very slow 2X. It frequently crashes my iMac, requiring, reboots, reloading of Toast and plugging/unplugging of the drive. Tech support is terrible- they knew less about this than I did! I'm going shopping for a new drive soon, having wasted money and way too much time trying to get this to work.t"
4,A fun device,This is a fun device that has amused the family. It was easy to setup. Since starting it it has run continuously for the last month.Great conversation piece that serves a good purpose.
4,Best caller ID for distance viewing,"This is our 3rd time buying one of these. It is fabulous for checking caller ID from across the room without squinting, as well as the date and time. These things don't last that long - maybe one or two years - but they're still worth it. You can program it to turn off at night too."
1,Great product but noisy as hell,"I love the design and the functionality, caller id, clock, greetings, customizable messages, etc... however, the noise is way too loud. i've exchanged it twice hoping the motor was defective, but it's always the same... noisy as hell!"
3,nice to have but blue lights are blurry,"I bought two of these about ten rears ago from Brookstone as gifts. The blue one had blurry lights that jumped a little so it was hard to read. I took it back and got a red one. (They told me all the blue ones were being returned.) It worked great. Mine finally gave out so my son found this on Amazon and bought it for me for Christmas. I love having the item but he paid way too much for it and once again the blue lights jump so it is hard to read. Can't send it back and cannot find a new one. If you find one just don't buy it if it is blue, they are defective."
1,Easily-broken junk,Flipped the light switch on & off & that was apparently enough to kill it. Now I see it is vastly over-priced. Go elsewhere.
2,Below Average Quality - but I got TWO free replacements!,"We purchased one originally on 11/14/05, it started with the funky, jumbled, letters, numbers, signs, etc within 6-7 months. I took it back to the Discovery Channel store where they gladly replaced it. The new one lasted even less time, and given that they didn't issue me a refund/new receipt from the first return (my mistake for not insisting) I could only show the one initial purchase from 11/14/05. They refused an exchange or refund even though I was within the one year warranty period. However, I did call the 866-537-0384 Wave Customer Service number upon arriving home and they mailed me a new one! Didn't even ask for proof of purchase! Even though the product is not well made, they have EXCELLENT customer service!!"
2,I should have read the other reviews more closely,"Someone else mentioned the problem we have with it -- it has to be on 24/7, and it's very, very bright to have in a bedroom at night. The date/clock function has to be running, or else the CID system doesn't work. What would make this perfect is to have a ""sleep mode"" to turn off the clock and only have it wake up when there's an incoming call.I bought this for my father for Christmas, because he has trouble seeing the small CID displays, but less than a week later he's unplugged it because the display won't shut off. Too bad he already threw the box out, or I'd return it."
3,"good idea, can read display across rooms. a bit noisy and not durable","I have used several of these and have two more in storage. They take a bit of patience to set up, but once you do they work well.The display does provide caller ID info at a glance, day or night, from across several rooms if you have good eyesight. I screen all calls before answering so this was my key reason for buying; that and the firesale price of US $20 each.The infoglobe is not completely silent. The rotating display uses a mechanical rotator mechanism and it makes humming and fan noises. The noise is about as loud as a gentle whisper; it does not interfere with conference calls from the speakerphone two feet away.Durability is an issue. Neither of my globes lasted longer than two years. I will be replacing the dead ones with the others I have in storage soon. I do miss having the creature comfort.I probably would not recommend the infoglobe to a friend."
2,Works great for a while,"This thing is really neat. Easy to see from across the room and has a lot of nice features but don't expect it to work for more than six months. I've had two of them and they are both now useless. They don't just stop dead, but quit displaying calls and come up with ridiculous dates and times."
5,Get It While You Can,"Sadly, Steve is no longer with us, but happily he left us a small treasure. I'm a natural bodybuilder, and Steve Reeves is an example of just how far a ""natural"" can go. His heyday was before steroids ruined bodybuilding, so you can at least see what the human potential is for someone who eschews the illegal and unethical use of steroids. The book has some personal bio stuff, motivational Q&A, nutritional stuff, workout stuff...the whole shebang. I use it mostly as motivation. There's no winking-and-nodding about steroid use (most cut, super bulked pros are on the ""juice""), because Steve happened BEFORE anyone knew about steroids, much less how to use them to any effect. Like the title to this review says, get it while you can. Classics don't necessarily last forever."
2,Took me 6 months to read,"I'm one of those people who usually finish a book, no matter how painfully boring. This book tested that theory. Granted, I will note here that this is the first book I'm reading in the series, and perhaps that contributed to the lack of interest I had in the characters. They all seemed the same to me. The action scene near the end was pretty good, (hence 2 stars) but I found the book only slightly more interesting than that Era-crap (to which I had to resort to coffee and mandatory pages-read a day in order to finish).Jenny is an interesting enough character, but all the other characters seemed like little wooden miniatures. Again, if you've read the other two books and know more about the series as a whole, you may like this book. Definitely not one of those series you can enjoy from any point.The writing style didn't impress me, but it wasn't too painful. Dry but with hints of flavor."
4,Finally a resource for Vietnam era collectors,"I had a chance to look at this title at a militaria show in the Pacific North West. I liked it very much. Its timethat Vietnam era Militaria be given the respect it deserves. There are so many variations of theater madeuniforms. I cant remember if Thialand or Philipine tiger stripes are covered as some Air Force, Navy and Marinesalso had their tiger stripes made out side of Vietnam also. Its a really fantasic reference. Sadly, the renactorcrowd and various commecial vendors like Mil Spec are reproducing the tiger stripe uniforms.Recommended for a dealer of military or Vietnam era collector.If I were older I would have bought the uniforms I found at GI Surplus on Sumner ave Springfield, MA prior to their close in 1980."
4,A must have,"This card deck is the ideal both for people that are advanced in their practise and in readings and for people who are beginning.I really loved it, i have 2 main card decks and this is one of them.I cannot say it is the best over all,since there are wonderfull other cards as well,but it is really near :-)Take it, make it yours and keep it with love."
5,What a Wonderful Documentary,A truly ensorcelling dive into the life of the Buddha. The documentary itself is very well done and the interviews offer deep insight. I'm so thankful I saw this!
4,great info,much better way than reading about the life of buddha - good production - loved it and would reccommend it
5,Searching for Nirvana,This is a very clear and cogent story of the Buddha's search for the answer to suffering. Everyone who looks for the spiritual in this temporal world will find the Buddhist philosophy satisfying and at times surprising. This DVD is definately worth watching and listening to.
2,The Unfortunate Birth of A Religion,"I give this two stars only for the fact that it conveyed knowledge about Buddhism and where it came from. There was no entertainment value or self-improvement value to it whatsoever. In watching this documentary, it will be painfully clear how a person who gains unique insights to life generates a following of people who then completely distort and misinterpret his teachings and turn them into a religion. The followers of Buddhism are seen performing rituals and ceremonies and worshiping idols as if doing so conveys some special favor or wisdom. You see the sheeple grasping for hope through reverence of some guy who had some interesting insights into life a long time ago."
5,very informative,"My 3 year old Cane Corso developed a rash about a month ago; and along with speaking to veterinarians about the possible cause of the rash I tried to find out if the breed itself was common in having skin problems. I looked in bookstores physical and online alike, and came across this book. It is very descriptive. Unfortunately it did not have a whole lot in the health section whether skin related issues are comparably related to this breed, but it definitely covers the true characteristics of the breed. From a detailed diagram of what a Corso should look like to how to pick your puppy! It is a really good book to have on hand for any Corso owner or anyone interested in acquiring one of these majestic dogs. I am extremely happy just to have it on the bookshelf!"
2,Pages Smelled Like Cigarette Smoke,"Product shipped late, book was in good condition though. However, opening the pages of the book, the smell of cigarette smoke was a bit overwhelming. Since it was a gift for someone else, I was not able to give this person this book, which was disappointing."
5,Does not work on Vista,"I loved this game in its heyday several years ago, but the technical issues are getting to be a bit much. I'm hoping they'll license the title out to another company so more Creatures content can be developed."
1,Building blocks,"Not what I expected at all These are so cheaply made. I will not even be using them. The are made of cardboard!! I thought they would be already assembled and a different texture, not cardboard. You even have to put each block together. It is completely unassembled. Very disappointed and very cheap looking."
5,Very nice product.,I came across this statue along with the Anakin Skywalker Maquette. I purchased both and set them up in my display case. If you are a fan of the Maquette style of statues then don't miss this one. The detail is nice and colors are smooth. Very nice.
4,Good deal,"I picked this up due to the price. It was cheaper to buy the set than ""Big"" and ""The Princess Bride"" individually. I just consider ""Nim's Island"" as a bonus. I picked this set up when it was 34.99 around the holidays."
2,Disappointed,"It's noise. Save your money. There are maybe three halfway listenable songs, the rest sounds like someone left the mic on in an airport."
1,"""Bad weather and flower shortage""","Zero stars. I was informed by the seller that my mothers day floral order had been cancelled due to ""bad weather and a flower shortage"". Are you kidding me?"
3,It's not ALL about sex!,"Very interesting little book. I always suspected that women ended most relationships, but 91%!?! WOW!!! Anyone consider this as a reason? UNREALISTIC EXPECTATIONS!!!"
1,only men want sex and women need to hold back?,"The entire premise of this book is based on the assumed power women have over men through sex.It discounts the many truths that men also have the same sexual power over women.Women are the givers and men are the getters nothing different,simply the same thrown about myths which have exsisted for years in order to keep women's sexual desires in the back closet long enough so the woman will always be blaming herself for being 'sexually too available' and walk all over her sexual drive to keep any man under any circumstances. If men were really like this I would join a convent because to withhold sexuality in order to keep interest is a very sick game. Also the book is on the premise that women don't want sex and only use it to get love in return.What a sad way in which to look at relationships."
2,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,"WOW THIS BOOK WAS BAD. THE BOOK STARTS OUT WHEN SHE ENTERS A TREATMENT PROGRAM SO YOU ONLY GET GLIMPSES OF THE 12 YEARS LEADING UP TO TREATMENT. IN THE PROGRAM ALL SHE DOES IS CRY,WHINE AND THROW TANTRUMS. SHE GETS A CRUSH ON ONE OF THE MARRIED PATIENTS AND THEY PASSED LOVE NOTES LIKE THEY WERE IN GRADE SCHOOL. THE BOOK FEELS LIKE IT WAS WRITTEN BY A TEENAGER. SHE ALSO CLAIMS THAT WHEN SHE WAS 3 YEARS OLD SHE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL FOR SEVERE BURNS AND HER NURSES TOLD HER TO GROW UP AND QUIT CRYING AND WERE VERY ROUGH WITH HER. I HAVE BEEN A NURSE FOR 21 YEARS AND I FIND THAT EXTREMELY HARD TO BELIEVE. IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A SERIOUS PERSONAL ACCOUNT OF THIS ILLNESS PASS ON THIS BOOK!"
2,Not Up to Par,"Perhaps I shouldn't review this, because I only gave the book 100 pages, but being a professional book reviewer, I feel comfortable in feeling that if a book doesn't do it for me in the first 100 pages, it's never going to. ""Coffin Dancer"" is a very disappointing read after the rollercoaster of ""The Bone Collector,"" the first Lincoln Rhyme novel. I was really anxious to read ""Coffin Dancer,"" because I like Rhyme and Amelia Sachs so much, but it moved slow as a slug on a hot day. The only thing that drove the plot was the romance between Sachs and Rhyme; the killer could have zapped his target very early in the book [he had means and opportunity, and time] but for some mysterious reason he never bothered to pull the trigger. I wish I could recommend this Deaver outing, but I can't. I will read ""Empty Chair,"" because I like the protagonists so much, but I'd tell others to skip ""Dancer"" unless they need a sleeping draught."
5,I hope there will more Lincoln Rhyme - Great Book,"This a fast moving and interesting book. Lincoln Rhyme is unique, intelligent and makes for a great getaway read. I read both The Coffin Dancer and The Bone Collector in 3 days."
4,Wow! it's great!,"Frankly speaking, reding the first half part, I thought it was boring..because the attacks and failures to catch the killer were repeated.. But I don't know how fast I read the rest part...subsuing the breath, I empathied with the people desperate to catch the coffin dancer.. and revelation and shocking reversal! Wow! It's greater than Bone Collector (though I watched it as movie..but had better read the book). Jeffery Deaver is an admirable writer to write this book.. But as for the rating, I saved one star..hoping more fascinating book.."
4,Well Put Together,"A very good story. The twists and turns, especially toward the end, were enjoyable. The writing seemed a little wooden at times though. Mr. Deaver tells a good story, but he isn't what I would call a good story teller. Still, a worthwhile read."
4,"Typical Deaver/Rhyme - chilling plot, relentless search for villain!","We're slowly catching up on some of the earlier Lincoln Rhyme stories, featuring his sidekick and ""leg-man"" Amelia Sachs, as well as a few other regular supporting cops from the NYPD. The elements are similar to Deaver's other tales in this set: a bombing murder gets things started, with a hired killer set on killing off the other key witnesses before they can testify in another high profile case. Thus begins the race between the genius Rhyme and the bad guy (""the Coffin Dancer""), with plenty of forensic crime scene work done by Sachs, whose relationship with Rhyme turns ever more amorous despite his condition as a C4 quadriplegic.We can count on Deaver to deliver a thrilling plot, clever detecting (Rhyme per se is very reminiscent of Nero Wolfe!); and sustained action that keeps us flipping pages quickly! Twisty ends usually entertain right to the last page -- ""Dancer"" is another good entry in a good series!"
3,guilty pleasure,"I have to admit I enjoy reading this book, like I enjoy watching a Michael Bay movie. Deaver's writing is powerful enough to punch you through the book, I would have LOVED the book if he let-go of some of his unnecessary ""twists"". If he dares to be less commercial he has the chops to become one of the bests in contempory fiction."
5,Great twisty plot,"I must say this was certainly better than I expected. Most of us are used to twists and turns, but the Coffin Dancer threw me; time and time again. It's a very good read."
5,Insight into lateral thinking,The coffin dancer gives a brilliant insight into the way things can be looked at from many perspectives. Just as you think you have worked out the direction of the coffin dancer the master of deception adds another layer of complexity. Trying to piece together the puzzle of this incredibly complex tale is both challenging and exciting. Jeffery Deaver also possesses a superb talent in how he uses the relationships between his characters to have a major impact on the way this story unfolds. A very rich tapestry indeed!
3,"Sluggish at First, Then Got Me Mid-Way","I read very little fiction so I cannot compare this with some of the other authors cited by previous reviewers here, but I enjoyed this book for what it was. Deaver pulled the rug out from under me right in the first chapter, so it's a shame the story got a little draggy for the next several chapters, and some of Rhyme's brilliant deductions have a pretty high ""oh come on"" quotient. But a wierd thing happened. I found myself looking forward to the chapters dealing with the killer much more than the sequences with Rhyme. And then when the story caught fire again past the mid-point I really got engrossed. I've read other fiction books which I couldn't put down from page one. This wasn't one. It took till page 300 (paperback) but once it got cooking it was well-worth the read!"
3,"Has flaws, but don't we all!","This is a detailed and comprehensive work, with a great deal of useful information despite it's 1981 copyright. However, the organization of meridians and points is a bit chaotic, as the authors have attempted to create a ""functional clinical"" model of point selection and location. The meridians and points are divided by body region, ""common"" points, extra points and points of ""rare"" usage. Unless you subscribe to the same 150 common points as the authors, you will have to search around a bit. The indices do help in that regard.The individual point descriptions are among some of the best I've seen. The meridian charts are the cheap Chinese type, form a lump in the middle of the book and are better supplemented with other sources. I can't say I refer to this text much, but when I do it's very useful."
5,"Easy Read, Easy to Implement","I am the Nursery Coordinator and serve on the Ministries Committee at our reformed Presbyterian church. I am also the mother of a 13 year old son with special needs. We are utilizing this valuable resource teaching children at our church about disabilities in general and how to befriend special needs' kids not just tolerate them.One of the best things about this book is that it is a simple read and very easy to implement. In my opinion, it's a great starting point for introducing a special needs ministry."
4,The mixed up tradegedy,"I have been relatively pleased with the Nomad Jukebox. It has a high capacity storage, and its battery life is acceptable (If you aren't planning on a big trip) Its limitation to only the batteries that creative makes is not so good, because I am afraid of what will happen if I dont do what they say. Its firmware could be batter, but it can be upgraded. I give this product 4 stars, because it is very useful and helpful, but not all as ""portable"" as creative insists on titling it."
5,I want to buy it but can't find it at local stores.,"I found this fat free peppercorn ranch dressing several years ago and bought the store out. I loved the taste and consistancy of this product. When I ran out, I could not find in our local stores. If someone knows where to find it in the St. Louis, Mo. area, please let me know thanks."
5,Inspiration for people working on regenerative medicine,"For someone working in the medical industry with stem cells, this book makes me stay longer at work, sleep later at night, and fight more in my meetings for what truly I believe in to make sure I am really doing everything I can to make this future medicine available to our generation."
5,Works exactly as it should,"This pizza peel works like it is supposed to. It's perfect for making homemade pizza and transferring it to the grill or oven. Overall, very satisfied!"
3,2 short!!,I give it three stars* because for 1 it was way to short!! 2 not much detailing and 3 it was well kind of boring!! *No offence!!* The manga one's r better. But I did like them! They introduced me into the world of cardcaptors!
4,Good,"For when you want to relive your childhood or get your child this, you need to get it. I play it ad I'm perfectly happy with it. Definitely worth my $2."
5,A must have for barrel racing lovers!!,"Wow, this game is a must have for anyone who likes barrel racing! The graphics are really pretty good, and as far as the horses, they're out of this world!!! True, it isn't as challenging as some horse games I've played, but it's very fun, and actually relaxing!(except when you have to compete at the ""Equestrian Center"") But all round, this game is really fun, I would highly recommend it!"
5,Fantastic Horse Riding Game,This game has it all. My kids love playing it. It teaches kids how to look after a horse as well as ride. I cannot reccomend this highly enough.
4,Lets Ride! Silver Buckle Stables*,"I really liked dis game for anyone who loves horses and that enjoy these type of games, this download worked perfectly on my PC after purchase on Amazon and I styll have it on my Desktop. I would recommend dis Game =)"
4,An enjoyable read,"I had a bit of difficulty with this one. Cassandra, a widow on the run from a possible murder charge, decides to travel to a Wyoming ranch and claim to be the bride of a missing brother in order to secure a good home for her baby. But older brother Morgan Tolliver is more than a little suspicious.What I had difficulty wrapping my head around was the fact that Morgan not only lets Cassandra stay, but falls in love with her and forgives all her deceits without question. I mean, I understand her reasoning, but a strong relationship requires trust, and I really don't see how there could be any after something like this.Despite the obstacle, however, it was a darn good read, and I enjoyed it thoroughly."
2,Bent bed post,My headboard arrived with a bent post. I emailed customer service and she said I will be receiving a replacement from the manufacturer. I hope it's soon because my daughter is waiting for a headboard in the meantime.Customer Service is excellent with giving me a contact before my item even shipped. I contacted her right away and she asked for the part # and said you contacted the manufacturer. I appreciate being given a contact before I even had a problem. I think that is good business.
3,Full Headboard,"The headboard arrived quickly and the company was responsive to emails I sent. However, it was harder to put together than I thought it would be."
1,Anti-Catholic film disguised as tragic romance,"The jacket cover says its a story about a burned-out school teacher looking for his father. Rather, it's a story of young tragic love, with The Catholic Church painted as the villain.This film pulls out all the stops and uses every anti-Catholic stereotype we've seen before - overly repressive clergy at service to a Church obsessed with money and sex. A twisted priest who provides poor council in the confessional. The main character ultimately killing himself, we are led to believe because of the guidance offered by the priest.Masquerading as a story based on real-life experiences it is anti-Catholicism of the most insidious kind because it is a moving story. Those unfamiliar with the Church will come away blaming it for all of the problems in the film.The film pays attention only to young passionate love, and gives no time to old love, sacrificial love, or agape love.This is truly a disappointing film."
1,Didn't work for me,I bought this product for my bushy frizzy curly hair. I used it with and without a diffuser and it didn't work.
4,"Redefining the Rules, Not Breaking Them","Although the title might lead you to think this book is about radical new ideas, it's really about a common sense approach to managing people that doesn't subscribe to the ""we've always done it this way"" mentality. The book is based on twelve core questions of a great workplace, questions that anyone can use to improve their situations and that focus on such things as clear expectations, recognition, the value of work, and learning and growth, to name a few. These twelve core questions are then used to outline the four keys of effective managers: selecting for talent, defining outcomes rather than means, focusing on strengths, and finding the right fit. Rather than breaking all the rules, this book really redefines more effective rules that create a greater impact."
5,truly new ideas and new way of looking at things,truly new ideas and new way of looking at things.very impressed. only problem is that it gets a little boringin a few places. must read for managers.
1,Depressing,"The premise of this book is people can't change or get better. What we have to offer our employers are our innate ""talents"". Forget about augmenting your skills with training, in management or any other area. This is determinism carried to the extreme."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,What a waste of my time. Step #1 in becoming a better manager is to skip this book.
5,Deep Insights for Managing,"The Gallup Organization has been doing hiring profile work for 50 years. One day, their chairman recognized that they could create a hiring profile for an NHL goalie, but not a front-line manager. He sent the PhD quants back to review the data. They rediscovered situational leadership. Great managers are self-aware and adapt to people and situations, balancing people and task goals.Gallup has subsequently built a whole consulting practice based upon this book. Their model and conclusions are based on data and have been proven effective in many industries. This is a well-written, accessable management guide."
3,Oh No!,They spoiled this show too soon. Should have waited until the last scene of the last episode. You know like the professionals do.
5,Too funny,Awesome! One of the funniest shows I have seen! Highly recommend if you need a kick to the funny bone.
5,The best Osprey modelling guide yet...,"Osprey has released several modelmaking guides recently, and they are all pretty good to very good. However, this one is head and shoulders above the rest. For modellers of all abilities, whether new to the hobby or those suffering from ""Advanced Modeller Syndrome"" as I am, there will be benefit from reading this book. Mr Edmundson is very talented and his attention to detail is inspiring. There are several models featured in this book and they are all quite impressive. The Hetzer with the interior is my favorite. Trust me when I say your modelling will be helped by reading this book."
3,OK but not as you would be led to believe,Typical Osprey book.The book's description alludes to the techniques of modeling.It's not there.Makes a good reference book though.
3,Billy Blanks Hip Hop Mix,It's okay. Too many steps in one segment. I believe it needs better music as well. There is really no push involved. A little too mellow.
4,Good surge protector/strip,"Strip works fine. Only issue is that its pretty difficult to insert plugs into the strip recepticles. I guess this is a good thing (good contact), but it requires a good hard shove to get the plug in. Big fan of the right-angle plug."
3,does the job and it's black,"it works, it does the job, its black. its cheap. the light illumination may flicker as it gets older, but thats to be expected."
2,Tights nice texture but not such a great fit.,Did not fit very well... Was the type of tight that would fall down as you were walking so you'd have to grab it and pull up...
2,Shopping Spree,"Wella, first video from this company and as a Guide there usually are Guidelines or Comments. Not here. This is one half hour of a lady touching her happy place. The camera zooms in and out. No talking, comments, or other verbiage at all. For this reason I wouldn't reccomend it, unless you want to see one woman's bridge to happiness."
1,Do not buy this book,"Neve buy anything with ""handbook"" in the title. My mistake.This book is nothing more than a glossary of terms with pretty pictures. Offering v.little practical information. The online table of contents seems promising. Alsolisting the page numbers would have revealed the true nature of this ""book"".Might be of interest to Complete novices with cash to spear.But i doubt it."
5,Excellent debut album by a great long gone west coast band,I feel sadness over the long ongoing feud between Matthew Katz and the band....it's truly unfortunate that this is all that represents an excellent album by a very influential west coast 60's band. Every song here was a keeper....they actually released 12 songs from this album in single format..they are very collectable...along with the paper jacketsThe first 2 albums by this band maintained the classic lineup..and the sound quality is fairly identical.....but very workable...read on.Here's a suggestion to those of you with discriminating ears:Invest in something like a Steinberger Clean software for about $99.00...you will be able to do some minor remastering to the overall sound...I used that same program to remaster some of my cd collection that I wasn't pleased with the sound quality. You might be pleased with the results.
1,Don't Buy This Buy the SUNDAZED Release This Is A Rip Off,This CD was put out in 2007 by Sundazed on a Nice Remaster with Bonus tracks Look for that one don't buy This trash from San Fransico Sound they rip Off The Band.We need to not buy this. Buy The Sundazed Used or Buy it on Vinyl !!!
5,The Banana Splits Adventure Show,"Please put this on dvd all the baby boomers will buy it, i want to buy it right now.Thank you"
5,Manes,"Ah, Manes... a band that has influenced various kvlt acts of today, such as Xasthur and Leviathan. As you can imagine, the recording quality of this demo is pretty dismal. However, if you can tolerate the bad production, and you should be able to if you are a fan of black metal, then you should be able to fully enjoy the atmospheric quality of this music. IMHO, this demo is better than Manes' full length release. The bad production adds to the atmosphere and gives the music an otherworldly feel...."
1,Do not buy it!!!!,"I got mine about 3 weeks ago and it is already NOT WORKING!!!! The battery cover is probably the worst battery cover I found in my life. It WAS so hard to close and now it is broken. Second, it freezes just exactly like a 386 PC with Windows 98 OS. Anyhow, I dont think people should buy this item and I wanna pay my most regrate for people who have already purchased it."
4,"Inexpensive, no frills, easy to use-It's great","I had an old 64MB key drive for four years and I seriously needed an upgrade. But I was also eyeing some mp3 players. I received a Cruzer micro 1GB flash drive as a gift, and I was given the option to exchange it for an MP3 player. When I learned that SanDisk sold an mp3 companion I thought,""I win!""I can have all sorts of files on my new flash drive, and the mp3 companion quickly finds the folders with my music files!I'm also impressed with the sound. For a small add-on, it's great. And preset equalizer options!!***It has frozen a couple of times. But nothing detrimental. Just pop out and insert the battery.,***I love the flexibility of having a flash drive for work and an mp3 player to get me through work. :)"
1,Not up to usual Sandisk quality,"I also had the freezing problem, FAT error problem (not solved by reformatting the Micro Cruzer). After about 6 months, the tiny plastic catch on the battery door broke, rendering the whole device useless. I guess you could duct tape it but then it would be hard to open the battery door every time it freezes. It is very cheaply constructed. I wouldn't recommend it even if you already have the Micro Cruzer, since for $69 you can get stand-alone MP3 players just as small with at least 512 MB. Better yet, buy an iPod Shuffle, which if you look around, you can get for $99 for a 1GB HP version, which is much higher quality and sounds better too."
2,unreliable but ok for its price,"Nice idea and a good value for your money if you already have a SanDisk cruzer micro USB disk. However it has some annoying problems:- locks up sometimes, requires taking the battery out to reset it.- when the battery is half-empty it reports a ""FAT error"" and refuses to read the USB disk.- So unless you already have a SanDisk cruzer micro USB disk, don't buy it."
4,Great Sound.,I've had the Companion for about a month now. This is the third mp3 player I've owned and probably the best sounding. The EQ settings are great. I do find that it stops every now and then. It just doesn't like certain songs I guess :-) Only seen this a couple times though. I did find the volume quite low too. Much lower than the others I've had. Battery door looks flimsy but I believe it's quite strong actually. Battery life is pretty good. I run every day and I've gotten about 7 hours on one battery. Belt clip is useless. Luckily the last player I had came with an arm strap. I use that. Perfect size too. SanDisk should come up with one for the Companion.
3,It's Ok but It could be better,"Its my first flash drive mp3 player, when I saw the pics I did think that It was small and thin but it doesnt.The battery supply only 5 or 6 hours (The led light consume a lot energy). Theres no way to select a specific mp3 file.Well next time I will buy an Ipod"
3,Very short story,"I thought it would be longer, it was only a few pages. It would have been better to just have a downloadable copy, I could have just printed the 10 pages myself. On the positive side my 3 year old loves the story."
4,Good Commonsense Advice,"I haven't listened to the author's radio program, but so far the advice in this book is solid. Good advice to parents that tend to helicopter. I'll update as time goes on"
1,Substitutes politics for scholarship,"This book is simply propaganda without any genuine content. It consists of a set of mostly irrelevant and inaccurate attacks that serve to misrepresent pro-Zionist writings. And that is a shame for potential readers who might want to get a picture of what antizionists actually want, what complaints they may have, and what truly motivates them."
1,Biased,"This work lacks any reasonable semblance of impartiality and honesty. The author relies on tendentious and biased sources. If you are looking for a critical analysis of Israel's part in the Arab-Israel conflict, look elsewhere."
1,Fix it for cheap...,The bags are made with cheap nylon zippers that break really easy (design flaw) and really fast. My wife bought a 24 inch heavy duty metal zipper for 3 dollars and now it should last longer than the motor. A new cheap one will just fail again.
3,Toro bag review,"The bag works well and does a fairly efficient job of collecting the debris drawn in by the vacuum. It allows a bit more dust to penetrate the material which ends up on the operator, than the original collection bag, however.Also the price seemed a bit excessive when the size of the bag and amount of material involved, is considered.Toro had best be wary of a comparable product when it is furnished by a Chinese manufacturer. I would guess the price of a similar one would be around $10, at Harbor Freight Tools."
5,Product as advertised. Same as original.,Product as advertised. Same as original. This is a factory replacement. I would order it again if I needed one.
3,Insufficient Information!,"Toro Blower Vac Replacement Vacuum Bag #51601When the zipper on the original bag failed, I noted that it was poorly designed and of inferior workmanship. However, I did not want to pitch the blower/vac, which is an excellent machine. I did pitch the bag. Big mistake, since nowhere was I informed that I would need the collar from the old bag when I purchased a replacement. Now I have to order a replacement collar from the manufacturer--or to be more accurate the American front for a Chinese manufacturer--and pay a big shipping charge. SAVE THE COLLAR!"
5,Great Toro Bag,We love and use our Toro leaf blower/vacuum/mulcher so much here in Michigan that we wore out the bag - although it lasted for 2 years. The new one was sent quickly and was put to use immediately as we have lots of trees losing leaves daily this time of year. Great product!
1,Toro Blower bag sucks,I couldn't find a replacement bag for my Toro blower at any of the hardware stores around me. So I ordered the bag online. Within a couple of hours using the bag the zipper blew out and the bag is now worthless. Doesn't anyone make quality products anymore?
3,Replacement,"Old bag wore out, zipper died. Wish Toro would reinforce corners and put better zipper in bag.Machine is now about 5 years old and continues to suck up the leaves."
3,"Truths, half-truths and falsehoods","Mangasarian's argues lack of historical evidence for a man called Jesus, widely believed to be the founding father of Christianity. This is lacking too in the case of Paul, the successor to Jesus. Bible is contradictory and confusing and could be hardly taken as a valid evidence. This much is fine. The author then embarks on a perilous and self-contradictory journey in claiming that it the slavish Asian thought that killed the rational paganism and ingenuity of the Europeans. So much for the rational European civilization, that was ultimately conquered by the magicians."
5,Anti-Futurism...,"When people think about Metropolis, the one from Germany or Japan, they think Futurism. But in fact the movies, plus this manga are about bringing the human INTO the society. Futurism is about speeding, shiny cars without humans slowing things down or getting in the way. But Metropolis is about humanity and mercy and the human heart. Even Michi was built with a heart, a symbol of hope in a machine designed as a super being. This story just cannot be compared to the films or any other work of art. And it is a work of art that EVERYBODY should read at least once in their lifetime, like 1984, Brave New World, or Dandelion Wine."
2,Multipet Look Who's NOT Talking Koala,"I have a rescued Boston Terrier that had no idea what a toy was until a few weeks ago. We gave him this and after initial uncertainty, this became his favorite. That lasted about a week and then the toy lost its' voice. He didn't play with it that much or that hard, thus my low rating. Cute idea, appealing toy while it lasted, but it did not withstand Reggies' play. Too bad."
2,Interesting,"The story is very interseting. But the lessons learned by the author are really boring. I would only read this book if it was required reading for a class, as it was for me."
5,The Book of Story Beginnings,"The Book of Story BeginningsOur school librarian introduced me to this book. It is a must read! I borrowed it last year and bought my own copy this year. As a teacher, the title says it all. I read this to jump start my writing program in fifth grade.The unlikely adventure has many twists and turns to keep readers and/or listeners engaged. ""Keep reading!"" is what I always hear when I stop for the day."
3,"Actually, it lures you in and then disappoints you","This book starts strong and then just sort of peters out.The set up is well done. Lonely relocated girl feels overlooked and a bit lost. Romantic family history of the much earlier unexplained disappearance of a family member. ""Magical"" book that makes stories real. What's not to like?The problem is that after all of this setup, which takes quite a while, the adventure begins, and everyone just wanders around in an implausible and confused plot that is neither compelling nor satisfying. If you read the more thoughtful reviews posted here you will note that there is uniformly a sense of disappointment that the book is both overly long in the early stages and thin toward the end.That said, the book is certainly a worthwhile read, but I would save it for a younger reader who is willing to tolerate the length to get to the payoff. Otherwise, it could be a discouraging experience."
3,"One boring, one not . . .","The Korean monster picture YONGARY looks phenomenal here in nicely restored widescreen, especially when compared to the various public domain releases of years gone by, but it's as boring as it ever was, sadly (it takes a good three+ minutes for the heroes to administer their winning ""dose"" at the climax). Also probably the only time I've seen a major character in a 60's movie anywhere die from rectal bleeding. Unique for what it is--Korea's first giant monster film--but squarely aimed at undiscriminating kids of the day (who preferred their monsters to dance!). KONGA's a different beastie altogether, although it's as budget-minded as YONGARY thanks to legendary producer Herman Cohen. But with Michael Gough in the lead, an actor who knew just how to pitch performances in this kind of material (most notably in Cohen's HORRORS OF THE BLACK MUSEUM), this is premium schlock with a gigantic ape--made that way by a jilted woman no less--stomping around a miniature London."
4,Damn ......,"Whoa! where to do I start....? Island has been one of the greatest pleasures to read. In-Wan Youn has one of the most new and terrific story line out of the tons and un-orginal mangas that now plague the shelves. His story keeps you always wanting more, craving the next manga to ready. The story starts off at a normal rate then just rockets off from there, not to mention the totally awesome art work that blows your mind on every page! Kyung-il Yang has some of the most fantastic work you will ever see in a manga, its a fairly different style from most of the manga which fallows kind of a basic camp style, which can get really irritating. This manga is a must see, you HAVE to check it out, for the most people im sure they'll ejoy it as long as you don't have a problem with some gore, it's morderate and has swearing in it. Just give it try, no true manga fan could really hate it."
3,DOES IT MAKE YOU SMELL LIKE ANTONIO BANDERAS LOOKS?,"Close enough. But Banderas has his own brand of colognes and scent, which are pretty nice, by the way. Or is Musgo Real just the coast of Iberia? Caution: Women love that smell."
2,Nothing more than a toy to the cat,The cats removed this collar several times in the first 24 hours. They even unbuckled it somehow. The whole time they thought I was just playing with them when I put it on. The bell just made them more determined. Although it lasted longer than the snap one I also bought. They actually managed to unsnap the connector. This is the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1.
5,Solid Burner,"No problems at all with this burner. Installation took only 15 minutes, and I'm not a computer tech...."
3,replace every two years,"This will be #3 of these heaters- so far I have had to replace it every two years, if I could find something else to fit the hole and space I would try it. I have this unit in a houseboat so it is used infrequently in the winters but after two years it either will not turn on or if it does after about 30 minutes it starts tripping it's internal circuit breaker. I have one cover with a hole drilled in it so I can reset it with wooden dowel. Cleaning heat strips and the fan makes no difference. Funny but prior to this boat I had a Bayliner 3250 Conquest with 2 1500watt heaters and when I sold it 10 years later both worked just fine and we all know how cheap Bayliners are."
4,"Good product, bad thermostat.","Easy to install. Problem with the themostat on the original unit, called Broan and they quickly sent me a new themostat to replace. Heater does good job in bathroom."
4,"Wall Heater, Broan 174","Received as advertised, good quality, and promptly shipped. Product was easy to install and matched the decor in our basement powder room perfectly. It supplies just the right amount of heat and is controllable by means of a dial thermostat. I just wish I could get my kids to remember to turn it off when not in use. Having said that, I plan on putting it on a timer just as a precaution."
3,SUMMARY,"I like these heaters, but I was disappointed when they wouldn't work. All I want is a replacement for both.THANKS"
2,Great player... while it works,"I actually bought this as a gift for a friend, and she loved it. The player was small, light, had decent sound, and was working great until just a short while ago. The player just spontaneously died (just sitting on a desk... it wasn't being jostled around while running or anything). To my horror, I've discovered problems with the Nomad II line are fairly common ... To top it off, the unit was past its short 90 day warranty, so there's a [monetary fee] (plus shipping) just to have Creative examine the player for repairs. After they assess the problem, they'll charge extra money for repairs. For all that time and money, you may as well just buy a new player from another company. Stay away from this product. It seems like a great deal, but they are manufactured cheaply and prone to break down. Creative itself doesn't even have enough faith in their own product to back it up with a better warranty."
4,No Radio,"Great product and everything, but beware, there is NO RADIO. The Nomad II has a radio but not the Nomad IIc.But it's still a great product"
5,Magical!,"GREAT! FANTASTIC! Children and adults will sing along to the ""Foot Stomping, Rockabilly, Ragtime too"" music and will listen with anticipation to the stories being told. I have seen Julie and Rives perform live and their CD is the next best thing. You are transported. It is clear why their work is loved by children. ""Let's Fill up the House"" is a wonderful mix of stories and song. Children will ADORE IT! JUST DELIGHTFUL!:)"
3,A great book for the early history of Tampa,"I had to read this book for class and found it to be ok. It is horribly boring in the beginning, but it gets much better in the end. A book written for history class-It is not an easy read if you are not going in to it eager to learn."
2,Annoying,"I found this movie to be annoying with Jack Lemmon's character constantly badgering the young couple next door. I was hoping the movie would be funny, but I didn't find it to be so. Too bad. Good cast. Just not for me."
4,Great Explanation of America's Shadow,"Eugene Taylor offers a great explanation of the shadow culture in America since the first Great Awakening in this book. He explains every aspect of the spiritual history of the United States, including the Quakers, Shakers, Transcendentalists, Swamis, and even the counter-culture of the 1960s. I especially enjoyed the section on the Americanization of the theories of Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung. I recommend this book to anyone with an interest in psychology or religious studies. As a student of both, I found this book to be an excellent mixture of both disciplines."
2,A Shallow Analysis Masquerading as Scholarship,"Taylor does indeed present an overview of a certain sort of tradition that has not been well-surveyed to this point. His historiography, while not deep, is adequate, given the wide range of material. However, Taylor's own agenda so overwhelms the history that his assessment of particular figures is nearly useless. To contrast broadly the ""Western rationalist tradition"" with the ""Western visionary tradition"" - as he does in various ways at every opportunity - is little more than name-calling. His ""faith"" in something called ""pure religious experience"" is almost 100 years out-of-date -- has the author not realized that all experience (including religious experience) is shaped by language, culture, and tradition? Unsuspecting readers, beware: a position as a psychitrist at Harvard does not make up for a history that is little more than an advertisement for his own personal spiritual predilection."
4,Death Note Relight 2 - L's Successors,"Pretty well done for a summation of the second season. There's at least 20 minutes of new animation made to compress certain events at the beginning. Though I would have liked to see an an extended ending more akin to the manga as this is labeled a director's cut.This is a fair buy for a hardcore Death Note fan, or someone who has seen the original series but doesn't want to buy the whole thing."
5,Superb!,"I needed an external drive in a hurry, and initially turned to external CD burners. However, after reading numerous reviews across a variety of sites, it quickly became obvious that none of the external burners were up to the task. According to reviews, most of them (HP 8000 series, Iomega Predator, etc...) suffered from reliability problems, and to exacerbate the matter further, transfer speeds were reportedly slow. Hence, in desperation, I turned to other forms of storage. To my delight, Iomega's Zip 250 USB/Firewire drive has performed excellently! I haven't had a chance to test out the firewire capability, but all I can say is that I am extremely pleased with its USB performance! I have successfully transferred all my files from my work computer (running on Windows NT) to my home computer (running on Windows 98), and there have been no software or reliability issues at all. Good going, Iomega! Now, if only they could pull their stock out of the pits........"

5,djcw's review,The author's first book on customer service driven a approaches to running a successful gaming enterprise.
2,Watch review,Not happy with the appearance with the watch. Appears much smaller than expected. Hard to read. Functions well.
3,Very interesting,"I thought this book was interesting but different than any other sexual study I have read so far. It was clearly presented in a way that deplict the reasoning behind the women answers, and some chapters, it gave the people report in their own words. Very interesting."
1,A disservice to pregnant women,"The title of this book alone makes me cringe. Pregnancy, for many women, may be problem-free. However, there is an unbelievably large population of parents out there whose babies die each year through miscarriage, stillbirth, or neonatal death. Valid worries and fears exist. ""Fearless pregnancy"" does not exist once you have lost a child, as I have. This book does a huge disservice to women in pregnancy, making light of potential problems and leading to possible harm to their unborn babies. And for those who do experience anxiety in pregnancy, this book, title alone, diminishes that anxiety, further isolating the women who are struggling so. Obstetricians and midwives need to focus on providing support to their patients through the fearful time of pregnancy, not spending time writing books like this."
2,A potential problem with using an all region dvd player,"I purchased this dvd because I have an all region dvd player by Toshiba. The disk arrived and when I went to play it the picture which is supposedly in 4:3 was displayed in 16:9. Furthermore the image was scrunched up. I tried the various settings on the dvd player with no change. My tv is an older JVC 27"" model from circa 1999. I don't think it is to blame but I don't understand the result. If this was common to all the copies of End of the Line it would have been commented on by others but no one has mentioned this problem. However, it happened to me so I pass it on as a possiblility for others."
4,Todays Flim Flam Man.,"This film is akin to The Flim Flam Man, starring George C. Scott. You'll recognize characters from your childhood, that you admired, but prayed you wouldn't duplicate. Nevertheless the heroes in this film, have the qualities in people you know you admire for the values you're not willing to fight for. You just love it when they appear in movies."
2,NOT WORTH IT.,"I've purchased many items from Amazon and been pleased, but this pillow is rather flat, not very firm, and definitely not for a person who sleeps on their side. It was a bad choice. Do not rely on the brand name. I tried it, then gave to my daughter, who said she can't use it because it hurts her neck. Next, it goes to the dog."
1,Looks more like a tourist guide.,"Brogan's title is a very ambitious one for a book in which he fails to separate the Colombian case (decades of violent guerrilla and terrorism) from the drug wars,who fails to note that there are five and not four Central Asia former USSR replublics, who includes Mexico (situated in North America, a geographic area regardless of economic and cultural differences) in a broad and superfluous Central America chapter. The book can not be rated above a conventional tourist guide where you get a brief summary of the conutry's history and current situation. Waste of paper."
5,Cracker Review,Crime psycologist who has many bad habits. However Fitz understands the criminal mind better than the UK police. This is another UK product worth seeing.
2,Not as advertised visually!,"I ordered this ring expecting it to be as pictured, but what was delivered didn't match either the visual nor written description! I got a thin ""Yellow Gold"" ring! Not the ""Tricolored"" Gold ring as pictured, and not the ""Rose"" Gold ring as described! Needless to say I am having my wife return this as soon as possible!"
5,DVD series Prme Suspect; well written and plotted,"I cannot stand commercial TV these days. I guess the operative word is ""commercial."" Stacking 6 to 9 ads every 13 minutes has driven me over the wall. What to do? I read reviews on various DVD series. I found one series particularly well written, scripted, directed and acted; Prime Suspect with Helen Mirrin. It is a series from England about a woman detective trying to make her way in what was traditionally a man's world. She asks for no quarter and gives none. She's very human and realistic in her role. Both my wife and I got caught up with the characters and the stories and have obtained all the sets of this series. Viewing the last show was like having a death in the family."
5,Elysia in Hillsboro,"This is the first shave gel that actually does what it says it does! I bought it a couple months ago and am really impressed! It really does make shaving less painful, and minimizes the red bumps. In addition, it's great as a dry shave lotion (like when you're camping) and it also works as an after shave lotion."
2,It kind of worked...,"I installed this unit on my computer located on the second floor of my house. I installed the receiver on the first floor next to my stereo (~30 feet). I got the wireless link to work but it was full of static. I tried everything to lose the static (different channels, different locations) but no go. Definitely not for audiophiles."
2,Awful.,"There were a couple funny points, but you've already seen them in the previews. This wasn't even ""turn my brain off and just enjoy it for what it is"" funny....it just wasn't that funny at all."
1,Disgusting movie,Had I known the real content of this movie and the vulgar language I would never in my lifetime rented it. It apalls me that I actually paid for this scum. And I only let it play for a few minutes. I am embarrassed that it will show up in my history.
2,"A few laughs, would watch again if I was stuck on a plane and it was playing","A few laughs, would watch again if I was stuck on a plane and it was THE ONLY thing playing.Typical Will Ferrel movie."
3,Had funny parts,"This movie was ok, however it wasn't over the top funny like I was expecting. It definitely had funny parts and makes an ok rental."
3,It ok,I thought this movie was ok. I would have expected better out of Will Ferrell. Its one of those movies you probably wouldnt watch twice.
1,Funny but filthy,"Got a few laughs, but it was not worth enduring the useless filthiness. I am not a prude, but the filth was just over the top in this movie, and did not add a thing. Definitely not a family movie. Would not recommend."
3,Average R Rated Ferrell Movie,Nothing special or unique about this one for Will Ferrell. I did enjoy Galifianakis' character quite a bit though. I thought he was the difference in this movie from being a 1 star meh-fest to having enough laughs to give it an okay.The plot was horrible though.
2,Not the best movie,"Not the best movie, but it does have some LOL moments! The problem is that it gets boring at times."
2,Pretty lame,Slow developing movie. I was often bored during the course of the film. I wool not watch it again or recommend it to anyone.
3,It is funny but...,Almost all funny parts of the movie was in the trailer. The story exaggerates today's american politics but the message is right on. As we have seen over and over there is no connection between the candidates campaign promises and their actual activity. It also demonstrates the Republican party struggle to find a decent human as their candidate. It is fine to watch it once.
4,should see it,"Very good political comedy. Good, weird entertainment. Typical will ferrell humor. Zak is excellent in his role as quirky, unexpected candidate."
2,Not what I expected,I love will ferrell and am a huge comedy fan. I did not like this movie. Had a good start and some really funny arts but quickly turned raunchy. I could have done without some of the smut and it quickly turned me off.
2,Typical Will Ferrell movie,"Why I didn't like it and why we found another movie to watch after ~10 minutes:Crass humor (typical for Will Ferrell) that was inappropriate for most of the dialogue and cast.Trailer did not showcase adequately the reason for the R rating and our family of 5 adults/3 teenagers found the crass 'humor' and comments embarrassing, not funny, and pointless to the plot of the movie.The movie could have been enjoyable and funny without them as the premise of the movie was timely with a cast that is well known for bringing laughs.Very disappointed."
2,Just Ok,"This movie was just OK. There were some funny moments, but they were few and far between. Both of the main characters are comedic geniuses, so that helped some. I think the problem was with the script versus the performances."
4,Funny start,"This movie has a very strong comedic start, but doesn't finish as strong in the end. However, we found it to be a very entertaining movie overall."
1,Horrible,Horrible had about four funny episodes. Watch the trailer for them and save your money.. I came back to see if I could give it negative stars.
4,Funny and entertaining,We were looking for a funny non serious movie. This had a lot of spoofs against past campaigns which was funny.This was also a very typical Will Ferrell movie
3,Okay,Kinda of lame story but WF is pretty awesome regardless of the movie storyline. I would not recommend this if there was something better to watch.
2,Ok,"Just an ok movie, wouldn't watch again. Some it was funny. I was hoping it would have more funny than it was"
2,Way too many F bombs!,F this and F that. Come on this movie would have been fine without all the F bombs. The edited version would be great.
4,Political Satire With Richly Deserved R-Rating,"If you like your politicians served up on a platter and skewered with sharp pierced objects, you're probably going to appreciate this movie and laugh a lot. Will Ferrell and Zach Galfinakas deliver strong performances, though cartoonish, as the warring candidates, and there is a good supporting cast that includes Dan Akroyd and other recognizable faces, that lend an air of gravitas to this movie. The best part of the movie are the satirical political ads shown, as there is such a thin line between those in the movies and those we're bombarded with on the air-waves, that it only takes a little suspension of belief to think that someone might actually air an ad like the ones in this picture.The movie is short, which serves it well, and the humor is biting. The movie definitely deserves its R-rating as the language and sexual content are strong."
3,The Campaign,Very funny movie and sadly real for today's politics. I wish the language had not been so bad. It really took away from the movie.
1,THUMBS DOWN,"I give this one star, it kept freezing & downloading it took to long! We watched it twice & was not thrilled with either viewing."
1,Worst spent money!,"From the very beginning, it had horrible vulgarities and sexual situations. I could only watch the first 10 minutes until I had to turn it off. Worst spent $4.00."
1,Lots of uncalled for cursing,"The amount of uncalled for, ridiculous cursing in this movie had me turning it off within 15 minutes. Not sure why I stayed with it that long. Thinking it may end or slow down, the sexual references, and profanity makes this film out to be made by a 10 year old-with a potty mouth."
4,funny,Will Ferrell movies always make me laugh! A bit over the top but that is expected in his movies. Worth a rental if you like him
3,Pretty funny...,"It's no ""Anchorman"", but this movie has it's moments. Both starring actors are great in their roles and there were enough good jokes to make me happy."
3,Decent movie.,"Not the greatest movie in the word, but it wasn't horrible either. I'd watch it again if it was on Netflix."
1,What a disappointment,I usually find both if these actors funny...but this was lacking humor. Movie hopes for an audience that doesn't think. It's like they didn't even try. I fell asleep half way through out of boredom. Sorry I wasted $3.99.
1,A waste of 3.99,"Seriously? Who thought this was a good movie? It was trying too hard to be funny, and ended up being ridiculous. Both actors have done much better and this is their worst yet. Even though I watched it while I was bored, I was sorry I did. I hope the selling point was the time it was released - during the elections, otherwise, I wouldn't advise anyone to see this at a theater. This was a waste of my time."
5,Hilarious,"Laughed so hard I cried. Raunchy, vulgar, and so darn funny. Not over top- perfectly done. Right on track with other Will Ferral movies."
3,Run of the mill comedy,Nothing special here to write about. Will Ferrell has done better comedies than this one. It had just a few laughs.
1,What ever happened to real comedy?,My wife and I only watched about 30 minutes of this garbage. The jokes and language was very distasteful. I find myself not being very impressed with Will Ferrell's sense of comedy.
3,Its worth watching if your a Farrell fan!,"Its not the best movie out there , but it has its funny points. I have never found that ""Zack"" dude funny, but he did a better job than Farrell in this one. Its not something i would buy on DVD unless it was under $5, but its worth a rent"
4,"Very funny, worth watching!",The Campaign was quite enjoyable. It has great acting and was very entertaining. Worth watching and owning to watch again!
1,Shaking my head,"The language in this movie is for the birds,, naw the birds might even joke. Other than the cussing alot of it and even the kids.. boy i didnt even finish looking at it. Reminds me of Stepbrothers couldnt finish that one either. Maybe next time."
1,Typical Ferrell Stupidity,"Will Ferrell has been funny in the past. Most movies starring him are silly and dumb. There are some funny scenes , but it's too much of ""an insult"" to sit through all the garbage along the way. Ferrell is making hay while the sun shines. Juvenile trash."
3,just ok,"With the actors in this film, I expected more. I think the movie is just OK. Some crude humor got a few laughs though"
2,Should have known better....,"R rated movies are not my thing, so I really should have known better. This movie is basically foul talk with dirty scenes. I suppose it was funny in it's own way, but more so ridiculous."
3,It was pretty good,I had to see it because of Will Ferral. Its the worst one I've seen with him in it but its still a descent movie. I wouldnt watch it again but i am happy i saw it. Hopefully he will be in better ones again
3,the campaign,"i usually don't like will ferrell movies but i did this one, i was compelled to rent this one i don't know why but i'm glad i did, i some scenes it made me laugh , would i rent it again no, but if it was for free yes...."
1,sorry but this was terrible,the comedy (and there is some) is sparse and far between. mostly this is a painful attempt to remain relevant for both ferrell and galifianakis. i cannot in good conscience possibly recommend spending money on this. it just feels desperate.
3,Tolerable.,I only gave it three stars because I get the message. It was nice to have some levity in a more serious campaign year. It was a boring movie though.
4,"AMERICA, JESUS, FREEDOM","I do not like slap stick, so much of this I see as stupid, which is unfair to those that like this type of humor.The story itself was overdone although it did have quite a lot of interesting dialogue. There was enough truth in it to make it meaningful. I particularly liked the line ""America, JESUS, FREEDOM."" I did not like the ending, in an attempt to get a happy ending they made it stupid.If it had been toned down a bit and made less vulgar, I would have enjoyed it more.The characters were interesting.The acting ranged from very good like Katherine LaNasa who played very well to okay.The filming was good.Worth a watch."
3,light hearted romp .. kinda misses the mark,not the best work of these 2 comic giants but not a complete waste of time ...some decent cameo's
2,Not worth the time.,"Below average comedy. Had a few funny moments, but all in all not worth the time it took to watch."
2,Alright,Just needed to kill a couple of hours and it wasn't bad enough to turn it off so I guess it could have been worse.
2,Don't do it. You have been warned.,"I thought I would wile away the evening with Will and Zach - have a few chuckles - laugh at the shabby state of American politics. Will's ""You're Welcome, America"" is much better political satire than this. This seems like a series of lame jokes strung together for an hour and twenty-six minutes. Jason Sudeikis and Dylan McDermott do some strong work in this but Aykroyd and Lithgow are caricatures not real people that we should really inform ourselves about. I am a liberal Democrat. This is a lame SNL one-joke skit that doesn't end mercifully after 5-7 grueling minutes but drags on and on belaboring the message that the American public is stupid, easily manipulated and big business is laughing (and profiting) from our folly. Spend an hour and a half working to overturn Citizens United. Not watching this."
3,Straight,Thought with these 2 together it would've been hilarious. It had its funny moments but not as funny as I expected.
1,Can't Rate What I Couldn't Watch,"Unfortunately, I wasn't able to watch it. After placing the order, amazon indicated they couldn't complete my request, however, I was still charged for it."
4,Laughter is good for the soul,"I gave this movie a 4 because in these turbulent times it is really important to laugh.Somewhat predictable, Will Farrell is his typical crazy character, that we would all like to be at times. Not worrying about political correctness and just coming out with it. Although it is a movie and the theme was over the top unrealistic, it was fairly entertaining."
3,ok only,its funny but a too goofy. It is a good parady of the real candidates. liked it only ok. whats scary is if its really what the candidates are like behind the scenes
5,Very Funny!,"This movie has some extremely funny parts, it gets slow at times but definitely a classic well liked Will Ferrell comedy!"
2,Funny but too vulgar,"We chose this movie because the commercials looked funny, but the movie was just super vulgar. I wouldn't recommend anyone see this movie."
2,mildly amusing,This is a good idea that they wrote the first page to and basically left some highschool students to finish. It peters out to the 'watch ur watch ' point very quickly
2,Not very good.,There were a few funny parts but overall this movie was not very good. I think it would have made a great SNL skit but not as a whole movie.
5,Super Duper Funny!!!!,We watched this video 3 times in the 24 hour rental period. Hilarious!!!!Will Ferrell is just too funny for words:)
1,A waste of time and money,Pointless. Watching clothes tumbling in a front-loading washer would be more interesting than this movie. No redeeming features what so ever.
1,Not what I expected at all,"This was a horrible movie. I have not turned a movie off without finishing it in years, but this movie was bad enough to warrant it. I would not recommend this movie to anyone."
2,Product Performance,For the most part I was pleased with this product with the exception that it skipped and locked up from time to time. If you are selling used movies they should be cleaned as well as tested to make sure that they play.
3,It was ok,"It was just ok... I'm a big fan of will, But this was just ok... Some funny parts but that's about alll"
1,movie,This movies arrived as new and on time..that's the only thing we can say about it. It was a very disappointing experience. Boring..stupid and only a retarded five year old would watch it twice. We kept waiting for it to get better. It never did!
3,decent,good movie glad i didn't go to the movies and watch it. there were some funny parts but not the whole movie
3,"A couple of one-liners, but that's about it","Typically I can't resist a Will Ferrell movie, and I am definitely growing to love Zach Galifianakis. But this one didn't live up to my expectations. It certainly had it's funny moments, just wasn't as barrel-laughing, eyes watering, stomach in knots kind of funny. The one-liners were great (it's a MESS!), but it left a little something to be desired. I'll keep my hopes up for the next Ferrell/Galifianakis match up...."
4,Nice movie,Good one to watch. Storyline though predictable after first 20min had enough to keep you engaged for the rest 1 hr
1,Stereotypes and cliches,"As a frequent traveler to the Black Forest, I found this book filled with stereotypes and cliches of the German people and culture. Swabia is a distinctly separate region of Germany--while it does in fact border the eastern side of the Black Forest, it is not the Black Forest. This book, in fact, reinforces the ""ugly American"" stereotype Europeans use when describing us. There are numerous errors in the book. For example, Alemania, alemmanic, and derivative words do not originate from the French word for Germany...it originates from the name of the ancient tribes who populated the area centuries before there was a German or French language.Too bad. Books about the southwestern corner of Germany are few and far in between. This is a celebrated crossroads of European and human history that is too often ignored."
4,Adequate,"It provides what says, temp and humidity, of course I have nothing to compare it to. It does rise and fall with the use of showers, so I guess it is working. Temp guage compared to another one six inches away is one degree different, but again which one isn't right???? Okay, I paid $46.00 I keep thinking you could have found one cheaper and then I paid shipping. I haven't used the alarm mode since it never goes over 70% and usually stays above 50%. The unit was easy to step up, batteries went in like a charm and it displays nice large number so even with your glasses off you can read it. Good luck."
5,Callahan's Drawings,"John Callahan's drawings are intentionally simple and primitive. Even though he draws with a pen in his mouth; he can still draw beautifully, but chooses not to. The drawings are raw and crude, just like the humor they portray. Callahan is a genius! Read everything he's written!"
4,Vet suggested,"My Vet , who is a specialist in treating very ill dogs, told me about this product...I trust him that he would not suggest just any product, so I knew this had to be good"
5,"Caruso I don't know, but still magnificent","I love all kinds of music from opera to rock, but am always looking for that special tenor who can stir my soul and rock my socks off. I've run the gamut from Gigli, to Bjoerling, to Del Monaco, to Corelli, to Pavarotti, etc., and they all have certain songs that just fit them. I wondered if Andrea could do justice to perhaps one of the more difficult operas around, along with Otello, (Mario Del Monaco being my favorite), and this Pagliacci is really good. Andrea simply ""rocks my socks off."" The supporting cast are well suited to the task and quite complimentary. This is a wonderful addition to my Bocelli collection. I eagerly await his next one, Cavelleria Rusticana."
2,let me see . . .,"I give these guys a 2 stars rating for being interested in some highly overseen theme..As a way to explore a little bit the authors' presentation of this topic in 176 pages, which amazon ""suggested"" to me, I simply went to their web site (theculturallycustomizedwebsite.com) and clicked on ""test your cultural IQ""..what did I get? a blank page ""suggesting"" to me download the flash plugin in order to watch some flash crud!!!.I wonder whose IQ (cultural, technical, ...) needs testing and I will stop now."
4,Ancient Greek history book,"I just recieved the replacement for the ""lost"" book. Lost by some mistake from the US post office. But the book itself is needed for a class and came in excellent condition. I was a little disturbed at first about all the packing, but looking outside my ouse I deemed it a great idea. Great Book for a ancient Greek History class or anyone interested in it."
4,Great beginning cookbook!,"My husband and I received one of these in the mail from the cooking club of America. My husband was so impressed, he wanted to give them to our children too! So we are doing our Christmas shopping!! This book explains the meaning of different cooking terms and shows you what it should look like!"
4,Faithful Rendition,"The Odyssey / 0-14-026886-3I'm not going to lie and say that I pull this out every other weekend for light reading, but if you're going to have a copy of The Odyssey on hand, this is a good one to add to the library. The translation is good, and is very poetic yet easy to read. The verse form has been maintained and reminds the reader that this was originally a verse, and not a prose narrative. The binding is tight and attractive, with thick sturdy pages, and with ""ruffled"" unfinished edges, giving the book an older feel, and making pages easier to grip and turn. I recommend this version, if you're considering buying The Odyssey for your library.~ Ana Mardoll"
3,THE GREAT ODYSSEY,The odyssey book it was very interesting to me.The story takes in alot of places in the story.The author describe very well the characters in the story. I will recomended the story to all the people because is a very coll story to read it.
5,Mother of all books?,"For a long time, in antiquity, Homer (meaning both the Iliad and the Odyssey) was the basis of all education. No wonder that these epic poems permeated the whole culture. The magnificent Greek drama ""continues"", so to speak, Homer, and looses any meaning without it. So, reading Homer is essential. Not to mention that poetry hardly, if ever, reached again those summits. The episode of Odysseus and Nausicaa is a love story full of nobility and restraint, a beautiful description of the duties and burden of being a king and a princess. And Odysseus, the great hero, weeps in public as he remembers his fallen friends, for a man is not a god, and that distinction was quite crucial, at that time. Feel the tension created by the terrible presence of Athena, who could be, in a party, say, just about every one. Fagles translation is a joy. I've read The Odyssey in several languages (unfortunately, not Greek), and my preferred one was the French by Victor Berard. Fagles' is as good as that."
1,Providing deceiving info: NOT the right translator!,"Amazon's intro description, editorial reviews and other customers' reviews of keep referring to Robert Fagles' translation and make comments on how beautiful it is. However, this paperback Amazon is selling is translated by Samuel Butler, NOT by Robert Fagles. What a deceiving advertisement!!"
3,"Good, but not the best...","I find the new translation by Ian Johnston to be vastly superior to that of Fagles. It is clear, direct and presented in a more modern English style while still remaining true to the Greek original. It is increasingly being used by high schools and universities and makes a great addition to any library. I highly recomment Mr. Johnston's translations for any lover of Greek (and other) classics."
2,ok.,"i ordered this book and expected it to be a little worn, but it was extremely faded and worn. not exactly what i expected."
3,Odyssey,Bought this for my son's school report. It was word for word from the book. The problem was that there wasn't much music or voice inflection and my son had a hard time wanting to listen to it and paying attention while he was listening to it.
5,Notes on the Kindle Edition,"This is simply an excellent Kindle version of a quality print edition. The Kindle version retains all the supplementary materials of the hard cover book, including the 60 page intro, notes (hyperlinked), and pronunciation glossary. The line breaks are fine, and the font is pleasing. The only draw backs are that the maps and genealogies are difficult to read in this format."
4,I say take the plunge,"I was fascinated by this transalation based on the review in the New Yok Times Book Review when it first came out in 1999. It also won book of the year award, I think. Then I read the Reader from Boston's very well written and credible knock. Then Robert Moore's rave. What to do? I bought the book anyway. I love this adventure and in fact have several translation of it, some in prose and not poetry form. You just can go wrong with Homer."
4,great book!!!!!!,I would recommend this book to anyone who loves to read about the greek gods and poetry. Very excellent book.
2,naturally slim and powerful,this book is for the biginner who knows very little about health matters and getting in shape.. The body is a complete balance that needs to be taken in a more serious approach. I would suggest this book only for those who are new to heath issues.
2,It was nice...,"It was nice to use at first; it makes your skin look fresher than it was when you use it. However, a couple of weeks ago I noticed there was glitter all over my hands everyday and it recently occurred to me that this product has glitter all in it. Hence the ""morning glow"". However, it never specifies that on the bottle. I can't believe I walked around with glitter on my face for 3 months."
2,Poor quality picture!,I was so disappointed in this movie's clarity. Purchased this video for my granddaughter after watching an old VHS version and thought the DVD would be so much clearer. Boy was I ever wrong. The sound was obviously enchaned but the picture was not Disney's best restoration accomplishment. Sorry I paid so much for so little. Do not recommend!
4,Excellent book for newbies!,"I am new to forex, I have been trading for about 3 months. This book covered the basics of technical analysis in a style that was easy to read and understand."
3,Acceptable for beginners who know little about TA,"I agree with most reviewers that this is quite a good book for beginners. Most of the basic topics (like MACD, Candle Stick, Bollinger Band, RSI, Fibonacci, patterns etc.) had been covered. However, the author had painted too simple a picture of the harsh reality in which it is very difficult to make money. Little had been discussed on the simultaneous application of multiple TA tools to avoid the ""traps"" or ""false breakouts"" so prevalent nowadays. For those who already have an acceptable understanding of FX and read to sharpen his/her trading edge primarily in Technical Analysis and Trading Psychology, I strongly recommend ""High Probability trading by Marcel Link""."
4,Such Fun !!,What the Preppie Handbook did for the Northeast; The Official Sloane Ranger Handbook does for London. This book really made light of our English cousins strange habits across the pond.A riotous read !!
4,svcoachcarol,Cost of the whole kit is less then purchasing it separately in a store such as Lowe's or Home Depot. Everything needed to complete the job is in one kit.
1,Fails to deliver on the title,"Waste of money. Gardner is resting on his laurels. There is so much that could be done with this title, but it was not. Instead we get a recital of stuff already said elsewhere not particularly related to the extensive lore which Tolkien drew upon. Way too little to do with the Realms of the Ring Lords, as if he was knocking off a book to exploit the popularity of Tolkien.Pity, I was expecting more."
1,The Book Needs a Serious REVISION by the Author,"There are numerous errors. The author should review each problem statement and solution, make revisions where needed, and send a FREE copy of the revised edition to the people who bought the first edition."
4,Great production! Loved it!,"As a Grad., student I am a bit confused as to what the previous reviewers are attempting to articulate. This is a wonderful production. BBC again, as always, very firmly grasps Shakespeare's spirited intent. This version of 'The Tempest' is diffidently worth the rental fee, as well as the time spent enjoying it."
3,Good,"All the actors are good, not surprisingly. The production is both interesting and dated, with barely clad dancing boys as sprites and some Dr. Who special effects. And the young prince does look like he was in the Bay City Rollers (Google it, youngsters). All in all, the acting carries it, I think. Worth a watch for fans of the play or Shakespeare in general."
5,Solitary,A very easy tool for the solitary Wiccan to follow! I highly recommend this book for anyone who wants to learn The Craft!
3,How many can you murder?,"Humility Garden, the first book, was alright, so I bought and read this one hoping that things would improve. The characters of these two books take life far too lightly, and for a book with characters capable of performing all sorts of miracles, why is Humility still blind at the end of the second book, and Arity still cursed with growing thorns, and...? I didn't like alot of the society of these books- the murderous Ghostiers, for example, and never came to understand the motivations of the majority of the characters."
2,"Great PDA, horrible phone","I've owned this phone for about 18 months and if I hadn't paid so much for it I would have taken a hammer to it long ago. Even in the center of a large town I get lousy signal strength; people can't hear me and I can't hear them. The PDA works well and I bought it so I could carry my calendar and contacts with me and dial them directly with one tap...nice features, well worth the $700+ I paid...IF I could get a signal. Now I have learned this is because this phone doesn't work on the ""third"" GSM band."
5,great shirt,"This brand, Gildan, is very superior to what we've been used to in sweatshirts. My husband loves the feel and they look as good after washing as when they arrived. Glad we bought several to keep him warm this winter."
4,Refreshing and original,"Purchased the c.d. after seeing them perform live on ""On Demand"". I was really impressed with their live performance. The disc doesn't have quite the punch as the live renditions but it's equally great. I will definitely be buying their live d.v.d. Hopefully we'll see a second album from them."
5,GREAT STAND-ALONE BOOK COULD EASILY SUPPORT SEQUEL,"THIS IS A WELL WRITTEN BOOK WITH AN INTERESTING MAIN CHARACTER AS WELL AS SUPPORTING CHARACTERS. IT IS WELL PACED AND ABSORBING. I PARTICULARLY FOUND THE HOB TO BE A BREATH OF FRESH AIR. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYONE AND HOPE TO SEE MORE FROM MS. BRIGGS. I WOULD REALLY LOVE FOR THERE TO BE A CONTINUATION OF THIS STORY LINE, TOO."
3,"Good, but young","I enjoyed the book, the idea, and the writing. The book is an early or rushed effort. Her later books weave a tigher story and do not have little moments that jar you out of the story."
1,A Princess Remembers - the Memory of the Maharini of Jaipur,I am really ticked that this is not available on Kindle.... I have a kindle to avoid books that I can only buy used and that are large and hard to hold... get this publisher to so-operate please...
2,"Sound good, wires weak","I loved these earbuds for 5 weeks, right up until they stopped working. The wires to the iPod (the stationary wires, not the ones that wind up) disconnected or broke inside the retractable casing. For a while it worked if I taped the cord so it pushed the wires into the case. But quickly stopped working altogether.Too bad, they're comfortable, the sound is fine (great on the bus), and the retraction works good."
5,A guide to fulillment,"Tune into Love is a powerful book. It can be used for self-help to promote individual growth and awareness. This book can be used as a guide to life in the areas of healthy relationships, prosperity, and fulfillment. Tune into Love provides positive and quality data to be referenced for confirmation of the research and facts. The four step process Dr. McCraw uses to teach all people how to enhance and enjoy our lives is sensational. The easy reading allows me to read this book over and over, which I enjoy because the principles can be adjusted to every situation and circumstance; it has changed my life and way of thinking. I now have more inner peace, and I can honestly say I am attracting more of what I desire. I highly recommend reading this book, if applied; the information depicted in this book will assist you in your personal journey to happiness and well-being."
4,Show Up For Your Own Life,"Margaret's ability to show us step by step how to get out of our own way and focus our energy on what we do want versus what we don't want is noteworthy. She offers a thoughtful, gentle yet action oriented approach to bring positive vibrations-situations and people into your life. She takes away the clutter, the old story lines and focuses on the present to deliberately create the relationship you desire and are meant to enjoy for yourself and for the benefit of the universe. I will read this book many times to keep tuning in, letting go and living with passion and purpose. Margaret is truely gifted in her writing and the experience she brings to the table."
4,A Pleasant Surprise,"Using details culled from vintage comics, Rosa takes a near-scholastic approach to this lushly illustrated graphic biography. Currently on sale for less than $12, this book is an exceptional value and appropriate for all ages. I'm generally not a fan of Disney but was drawn to this book by uniformly positive reviews from comic book aficionados."
3,A Band With Potential,"I'm more and more amazed at how I come to find such great French artists, many who are rock bands. I've listened to a few tracks from Blankass...I think that their sound is good, their lyrics are thoughtful (if you know French you would know what they mean), and they seem like a decent band in general...but for some reason, that doesn't seem to be enough. I find myself not really liking them as much as I should. Maybe it's because they seem to try a bit too hard...plus, at times they're just plain noisy. The sometimes over the top singing and loud guitars just overpower the song, making it sound almost unlistenable. I'd recommend sampling a song from them, but not sure if it's worth buying."
3,"Stories Great, Recipes bland","I found the pictures and stories to be great, but the recipes lacking. Most were not ""from scratch"", but rather ""from cans""."
4,"Worked fine for me, quality not great","3-stars. I have a Cingular 8525, and both the home and car charger worked fine for me. I also share the charger when we travel with a Motorola Razr V3 which works fine too. Only issue was the car charger cord is very thin, and seems to have broken internally (after about 3 months), so I have to twist and hold the wire a certain way for it to make contact and still charge the phone."
4,Looks Great,"The product arrived in good condition, thanks to excellent packaging. UPS was obviously practicing for the World Cup with this package. Assembly was a breeze. The fire bowl looks great, but the copper finish discolors once you use it. I expected that; so it is OK with me. I would recommend this to others."
2,Mis-aligned Holes for installation,The Pros:1) Nice Copper Bowl2) Cover includedThe Cons:1) Mis-aligned holes and short screws complicate installation. One screw was stripped in the installation process.2) Very short statureWill be contacting Amazon to either replace or return.
1,Lid burned through in less than ten uses,This fire pit is a complete disappointment. We've used it about ten times and the mesh lid is already completely burned through and useless. A waste of money! Will never purchase from this company again!
2,Fire Pit,Overall this was a decent value for the money. It is an attractive looking fire pit and we have had quite a few enjoyable evenings around it but the cover it comes with is totally worthless from keeping water out.
1,junk,"Yes, the light is good, but the battery is a piece of junk. I have tried to get by with this set for a few years, but I've finally decided to pitch it. I use it for wedding receptions, and I'm lucky if I get 15 minutes before the light dies out."
5,The Ultimate Ancient Egyptian Novel,"I first read this book while I was in high school. I borrowed it from a friend. It took me years to find my own copy and read it again. Why this was never made into a movie or at least a classy mini series on TV is beyond me. McGraw spun the magic of Ancient Egypt when she wrote this book. It's about Thutmose III and his Aunt Hatshepsut and their struggle for the throne of Egypt. I am simplifying things but if you love ancient history and novels, this is one of he very best."
4,"Great, but the Online Price is Too High!","SPECIAL NOTE: At the time of my review, the onlice price was $34.99I've used these filters for years. Completely eliminates that ""paper"" taste from regular paper filters. However, even these are only relatively permanent filters - they will clog up over time and you must replace them. I still buy and recommend them, but the online price shown here is exorbitant! I can buy this same item - same manufacturer and model - retail at many coffee stores here in San Francisco for $20.95. I order a lot of things online, but I go for price AND convenience. Caveat emptor!"
3,The package is a bit disappointing,"This book looks like a software manual in a binder rather than a regular book. Given the price, it is a bit disappointing. Most of the materials are rather elementary but could still be useful for some advanced readers."
3,Three levels,"Well made and strong, still too high on lowest level for me. May work for some, but not for tightness like mine."
4,lumbar extender,it is helpful for your back problem.i wont say it will cure but it takes away some pain and stretch your back.
2,Not what we thought,My husband had back surgery last summer and thought this would help with keeping the back stretched. It was too uncomfortable for him to lay on it. I used it a few times to see what I thought and did not notice any difference or help from this product. We returned it.
5,We love it!,"We received this as a gift last year and just love it! My three and four year old boys love to listen and sing along! And it doesn't get on MY nerves...very important! This is a great, FUN CD."
5,One notch up,This video is most appropriate for people who already learned the basics and want to advance to the next level up. It teaches great style as the instructors do beautifully.
5,GET BRAINS,THIS BOOK WILL MAKE YOU WONDER ABOUT WHERE EINSTEIN CAME FROM - ANOTHER SOLAR SYSTEM OR FROM THE FUTURE?
4,this book deserved the accolades it received,"This bio got loads of good press, and deservedly so.I learned things about the man that I'd never known- his research into recently released papers was very illuminating- particularly the story about the missing daughter, that Einstein and his first wife probably put up for adoption when they had the poor dear out of wedlock. The child has disappeared from history.My only critique is that Isaacson should have re-edited the initial chapters more thoroughly- as with his bio of Franklin, (which, I admit, I didn't finish) you sometimes learn more about Isaacson's brilliant liberalism than you do anything about his subject- but the last 90% of the book was spot on.Einstein, Einstein, Einstein...I wonder about people that seem to love the world, but have issues loving individuals."
5,Einstein: His Liffe and Universe,"I am extremely upset. When I ordered the book, which I have received, I used a gift certificate. I don't have the number at hand as I am recuperating from major surgery at a dughter's house. Now I have a collection agency chasing me for the price of the book claiming that my check didn't clear. WHAT CHECK????? The agency will not listen to me. What good is a gift certificate if you turn the account over to a collection agency. Hopefully, within the week I can trace down the number of the certificate. It was a gift to Joyce Jacobson from Erik Jacobson and Shirley Suzuki of Montclaire, New Jersey."
5,"""Einstein""",Absolutely brilliant! Walter Issacson takes one to the heart of the great Einstein by making him accessible to the arm chair intellectual!I even was able to understand the mathmetical offerings thanks to his great explanations!I continue to be a devoted fan of Amazon!Thank you
4,Wow,"I really enjoyed learning about the life of Einstein the genius and the man. I got stuck a little with the science (due to my own left brain limitations). The book is very lively and a wonderful introduction to many other outstanding contributors of the 20th century, some collaborators with Einstein, some contemporaries. An inspiring read."
1,Albert Einstein,"The book may be good. However, it was nothing that I was interested in. I also had difficulty understanding some of it."
5,One of the best books about Einstein,I fully recommend this book. Easy to read and follow. It is one of my favourites books.RegardsMS
3,Takes an Einstein to Enjoy,"Einstein: His Life and UniverseThis book was a struggle for me to read. It was a commitment once started that I had to finish. I personally found it only interesting from the standpoint of how scientist were viewed in his time. They were the most popular people on earth. However, in many parts the book read like a textbook and the story was pieced together. I did finish with a very good understanding of his life and his beliefs. It is okay to read, but not particularly entertaining."
4,Einstein: His Life and Universe,Informative book on the life and mind of Einstein. A bit over my head at times but still loved it.
4,Great peek into the brain and being of the man,Length:: 0:48 MinsMy personal opinion and impression of this complicated life story
4,A interesting and easy read on life of a genius,"Whilst having studied Einstein's theories, I never knew about the man. I found this biography of the real man fascinating, easy to read and showed the human side of the man."
1,IF I COULD ZERO STARS! WASTE OF $$$!,"This pump was a waste of money it broke in my hand as I was pumping the flat tire the first time I used it. It was the ""heavy duty"" pump and the handle that you pump with snapped off as I was filling the tube. I threw it in the garbage I dont even want a new one!"
1,Totally False Advertising,"This product is garbage compared to what the manufacture claims it is. They claim it will pump up to 90 pounds, which is why I bought it. My old hand pump will only pump my mountain bike tires up to about 40 pounds so I thought this would be perfect as I inflate my tires to 60 pounds. What a disappointment when I had to fix a flat. My new piece of Blackburn garbage only pumped my tires up to about 38 pounds and it was much more difficult to handle than my old pump, which I am going back to using. I curse Blackburn for their lies and I will never buy anything with their name on it again."
3,"O.J.,you sure did tell us!","This half-trashy book deserves a sequel entitled ""Now I Can Tell You"". The sequel could chronicle the civil trial. Will O.J. still tell us that he was falsely accused of his ex-wife's and Ron Goldman's murder? That was the shortest biography I've ever read. Michael Jackson should write a book about his false accusation of child molesting. O.J. could sure give pointers to murderers who use knives and switchblades."
5,SO COLD ITS HOT GREAT VIKING METAL,"awesome band enslaved are truly breathtaking music great atmosphreic instrumentation on frost..the son yggdrasil is a norwegian folk song style lyrics great.really cool like i said before one enslaved album you here you will be prompt to buy others and this one is excellent.not black metal form of it viking metal its excellent they started the whole viking metal.enslaved are gods hail ...there songs are so great frost ,loke ,jotunblod,wotan....freezing cold so cold its hot excellent metal band of high quality..buy buy buyl ....all metal heads neeed to have enslaved to be happy if you want to be :) buy this."
4,pleasant scent,Good for all day burning. light scent and decorative. I plan check out the other available products the upcoming new year.
2,not great,"the candle does not radiate any type of scent in the room. It smells nice on contact, but when burning does not leave room smelling like anything."
4,"It's great, but you can find it for less!",Amazon has been raising the price on this thing little by little over the past year or so. Its actually much cheaper at the manufacturers website.
5,Very useful label maker,"If you have one of those older, smaller label makers, it's time to upgrade to a new one. This brother label maker is really easy to use and very convenient for labeling. . . everything. It prints really clear and the labels are laminated so they are quite durable. Very pleased with this label maker."
1,DO judge this book by it's ...cover!,This has to be the lamest baby name book ever. I thought it would be an interesting source for helping us choose a baby name -- I was wrong. It's jam packed with both repetative and [poor] suggestions that anyone could have gotten for free on the internet with little or no effort -- which is I'm sure what the author probably did.One star is far too generous! Oh well...buyer beware!
3,Well-marketed by Europa Editions but doesn't meet the hype,"I fell victim to the brilliant marketing of 'Total Chaos' by Europa Editions - great cover art with a hook line front and center calling it ""the first book in the legendary Marseilles Trilogy"" and an 'About the Author' blurb on the back flap telling me that Jean-Claude Izzo ""achieved astounding and immediate success with his Marseilles Trilogy.""It's difficult to live up to hype like that...and this book doesn't. I found the storyline here to be confusing (new characters appear at random it seems) and formulaic (hard-boiled cop who can never love and denies closeness, etc.). The only thing of note and worthwhile is the descriptions of the teeming projects and streets of the city. It sheds some light on the roots of the recent riots in France."
2,I thought the book was a little dragged out!!,Ok this book really was crappy i mean ok its fine in some parts but absolutely terrible in others!!! I mean ok i was going to buy another one of Judith Micheals (the husband and wife writing team) books but after reading that its absolute torcher!!!
4,Awesome moisturizer,I got this product for after tattoo care and it was definitely worth the price. It soothes and moisturizes better than described. I use it as a lip balm and general moisturizer too. My husband and I both use is daily on our tattoos and have barely put a dent in the container. It will last you a long while.
4,the Magic of the ride...,"From Langston Hughes ,charles Dickens,John steinbeck,Czar Alexander III,and more...80 plus authors..It seems every word ever said or written regarding a train is compiled in this book. Poets,authors,kings,popes ect... If you love trains,if you love a great book that tells almost all that could be said this one may be your adventure of the rails without leaving your chair..I loved it,"
2,Released too quickly!!,"I found this game just a bit short. The idea is fantastic, and actually the AI is not too bad. As your product becomes more engineered, marketed, and distributed, you can see the change in the market. However, these changes are subtle, putting a new cupholder in your cars doesn't cause Idaho to order 500 new models. So far so good. However, that is about as far as they got, before cutting all kinds of corners. The marketing of your product is a difficult, slow, and not very realistic method. As a HUGE billion dollar corp., you are still able to only do 1 or 2 radio and television campaigns. Also, the game's ACTION CARDS, that allow you to destroy other company's invetory, payoff politicians, etc..., is basically like using the community chest in monopoly, its outdated. The graphics are pititful, and you might want to wait till they make another try. I made a bad buy, I am just suggesting you take your money to a game that has been thought through. Thank you."
3,Old Man,I have had the VHS for years and have nearly worn it out. Please try to get it released on DVD. One of the greatest films of all time. I know it was a Hallmark Hall of Fame production. Does this make it harder to get it chnged to DVD? I think others have been.
1,Movie is 10 star this DVD version is 0 star,Don't buy this version or take it if it was given to you for free. Wait for the new remastered version by Criterion in April. Lousy print
1,Unbelievably Poor Print,"There are no other words to describe the technical quality of this DVD, but very poor.Allied Artists need to hang their heads in shame over taking a cheap, worn print and using it as the basis for a master.Without question, the worse quality DVD I've ever seen released under the guise of ""digital."" Grade: F"
5,A Great Film,"The Red Balloon is a simple film telling a simple tale but it's greater meaning becomes apparent towards the end of the film. The story of a boy's friendship with a red balloon he finds in a Paris street is a real classic. The newly restored Criterion version looks great, with all colours (esp. the red balloon) intact. It's also interesting to see colour footage of Paris in the the mid 1950's. I bought the dvd for our son after he saw the film version recently on a trip to the local cinema and it's become the firm favourite in our house. Highly recommended."
1,Horrible childhood memory,"I also had to watch this during my elementary school days (mid 70's). Couldn't see the appeal of a story about a lonely, bullied boy whose only friend is a balloon. Boring and depressing."
5,Memories,I remember bringing my 3 young boys to the local library that was showing this movie shortly after it was first released. We all loved it very much and the boys were just riveted to the screen. Now I'm hoping my grandchildren will love it as much as we did then.
3,pop the damn thing already!,"I had read great reviews of this movie a while back and was so excited when i saw it in the tv guide. What a disappointment.Unless you've seen this movie as a child, chances are you won't see the appeal. It's a very average movie about a boy whose balloon follows him everywhere. The concept is cute AT FIRST, but after 20 minutes of the same damn thing, you're hoping someone will put the balloon (or yourself) out of its misery. It's difficult to make a successful film when you find no reason to care about it's characters, like this little boy who we know absolutely nothing about. However, on the upside, it is quite aesthetically pleasing, and the best part of all...it's only an hour:)"
4,Fitness With The Pros,Fitness with the Pros is a really a good workout. I have numerous workout tapes & DVD's and gave up on them after several tries as I found them boring. This is the best one that I have tried so far.
3,Just OK - Not what expected,This video does have some merit but I actually found it hard to follow as Edyta does not project her voice that well. Plus I have a carpeted home and doing this on carpeting just doesn't work. You do need an uncarpeted room to do this in. I was disappointed but at the same time I thought it appeared to be a good and challenging workout.
1,Dissappoitment,"I owned this product for @30 days. I was warned after I bought it that the SCSI version runs very hot and one burnt up on my brother-in-laws system soon after he purchased it. He warned me that it needs much cooling because his burnt up. Near the 30 day warranty my IDE version fried. This unit was a very loud unit to the point that it rattled a solid mid-tower case. It is manufactured by Quantum's fireball which Maxtor acquired. I traded mine in on a Maxtor 5400 40gig which has been bullet proof so far and is very quiet. I have talked with another user who after bringing back two, was happy with the 3rd attributing the bad ones to a bad production lot."
1,Not Up To Standards,This pan is so hard to clean I finally stopped using it and it also warped. It was a very big disappointment and not up tp Calphalon's usual standards. Buyer beware you will most certainly be dispappointed with this grill.
2,Stick-resistant?,I love the grill but have found that cleaning it afterusing it to grill steaks or chops that have been marinateda big chore.Can someone help me with this problem?
2,Stick-o-rama,"Despite all my efforts, everything I cook sticks to this pan, and I find it impossible to clean. I'm crazy about my Calphalon Commercial Nonstick pots and pans, but this one was quite a dissapointment. I may try the All-Clad nonstick square grill pan and see how that goes--I have a feeling it's worth the extra money."
1,Overpriced & Overrated,"This pan has very little (basically non-existant)non-stick quality. With the ridges, having a problem with food sticking to the pan, you are forced to pry the food carefully away from the surface 1/4"" @ a time!I have probably been equally frustrated with other cooking utensils, but never with one so costly. I wish I could get a refund, but the shipping & handling to return it as well as the hassle involved is more trouble than this is worth.Chalk this one up to the ""I've gone & ordered something I should'nt have"" category."
1,don't work,Could never get it to work with windows vista and could not find drivers on motorola website
3,Works like it should .........,Purchased this product for the AADP and AVRCP Bluetooth profiles that are NOT included with the Toshiba Bluetooth stack. Works as avertised.
1,JUNK!,"Came with a 350.00 steel storm door. I wrote door company asking them to quit using this product along with alot of bad reviews I found online. What a piece of junk. No matter how you adjust it. I see people stating it wont close right when its cold out,that may be the issue here. Its 35 deg. I wont ever buy a wright product. They rather dont care if it works or dont test them,either way thier company makes junk products!"
3,wrong format,I recieved the dvd and it was fine except it will not play in my blue-ray player. I can however play it on my computer. I wish I would have known about the counrty code before I bought it.
2,great while it lasted,We had this hose for less than 6 months. I went to use it today and it sprung a big leak.
1,"Sorry, the lamps are shipped and the return charges are yours!!","I orderd the lamps on Saturday by the internet. That same night, I decided they would not work in the room. I sent two emails on Sunday, did a live chat on Monday, and Tuesday was told it was to late and the lamps were on the way. Oh, returns are at my expense. I say ""bullshit."" You can't tell me that from Sunday to Tuesday these lamps could not have been stopped in shipment. My credit card has been charged and I will have additional cost.Anyway, I am buying two more lamps but not from Lamps Plus."
4,lasted one season,"this multi-function light was very entertaining for one holiday season, but was ""stuck"" on just one function in the second holiday season"
4,bag,"Have used the bag for 6months for college with zero problems.The material is a light, 600D Polyester, and the stitching is nothing special but so far durable.The strap might be too short if your obese or large, but perfect if your average size.Size wise it can just about fit 3-4 thick textbooks, but any more than 2 makes it uncomfortable.The zippers aren't oversized, but should be!"
2,Lost interest,"Though well written the plot lost my interest half way through. The story starts fast, but just begins to peter out. After the 13th chapter you can see exactly where this is all going."
4,amazon fan,Lovely collection even though at times it seems a bit off key but only Amazon offers the variety I crave. Thanks Amazon!
3,"Historically interesting, but...","...how successful have the Chinese really been at the art of war? Not very, quite the opposite actually (Vietnam handed them their asses on a platter). The Chinese suck at war, thanks to Sun-Tzu! He is often quoted but most of his ideas are simple commonsense, and are unlikely to help in any situation. Don't believe the hype, but still, read the book."
5,Good translation,"Cleary is a wonderful translator, who brings books alive. Also, the book itself is a wonder of military theory, and the general principles behind it are still of value."
4,A PRETTY GOOD BOOK TO READ,"The Art of War can give you a good picture of what it was like back then. A lot of the things the Generals had said still hold true today for example in business and in athletics. They mention ways on how to out smart your opponents along with other useful things. I was hesitant about reading this but after I finished it, I was glad that I had read it. 4 out of 5 stars."
3,"this is an overall, alright book","I had to read this book for a class. If I would have picked up this book to read on my own, I probably would have stopped about 2 pages into it. The introduction lasts for half of the book and it is hard to understand in some places. However the strategies this book teaches you are very good and can be very usefull. I wouldnt recommend this book to someone looking for a book to read for pleasure, I think that this book would be most efficient if it was to be taught in a class, than read personally.Overall I liked the book, and if your looking to get ahead in life, i suggest you read it too."
5,A must read for all strategists - both military and civilian,"This book contains writings from an ancient master whose words have withstood the test of time. Concise and poignant, Art of War holds meaning for anyone involved in developing strategies. While clearly written for military doctrinal purposes, Sun Tzu's teachings can be utilized in the business world as well.This book is a must for any decision maker's library."
2,Informative,"The Art of War is a factual book on strategies for war, written in the times of ancient China. Being like a history book, there is no core story that connects the chapters together. After the introduction that is about 1/3 of the book, it goes into the ""tips"" for war. It has one or two lines for a tip, then tells a story of how the tip was used. After a while, it can get very dull and repetitive, so I give it 2 stars. I would recommend this book to people in the military, but to anyone else it wouldn't be very useful or interesting."
3,Timeless Classic,"Ah... the absurdity of it! Poor me reviewing the great work of Sun Tzu...Three stars! Take that!Salesmen & marketers, read Sun Tzu.Students of war & engineers, read Clausewitz"
3,Spiritual Warfare,When the original tape came out the tracks followed on from one to another without a pause in between and was a fantastic spiritual warfare tape . The cd now has pauses added between tracks. Unfortunately it has not been well done and really should be re-masterd back to original without the pauses.
1,absolute piece of junk,"worked for for one day then stopped, left me in the cold until i could return it to the store. It would come on for get warm, then shut down then after that it would turn on for a few seconds and then shut off. could have kept warmer with a candle."
1,heater blows,"The unit worked well for while but developed the problems others report. I tried cleaning the dust out; adjusting settings; tried about everything; didn't help. The engineer (above) is right, one could by-pass controller. Tempting, but it is not worth it to short circuit safety shut off, even if you happen to be one of the suckers that owns one of these already. Please do not donate these. Someone who really needs heat and can't afford to take home a dud might buy it. Recycle metal or trash it if you can't return it. Or maybe you can sell yours to one of these people who say they like theirs. Lucky SOBs probably live in Hawaii."
2,Good DVD (if it works!),"I recently purchased this DVD and was enjoying it thouroughly until i got to the ""Don't Drink the Water"" Video. Near the end of the video, the DVD froze and there was nothing i could do to get it to continue playing short of turning it off and starting over. I figured this might be a fluke so i tried it again and it did the same thing on both of my other two DVD players.The content in the dvd is excellent, but it is up to you to decide if you can put up with the technical problems."
2,poor description,"If I had known this was for VHS i would not have wasted my money. the product description is lacking, buyer beware !"
4,Good basic teaching tool,"This book is a good learning guide for people who have recently changed from MS products and enables a user to configure a Unix system to do the same things they did on a Windows box. There is not much advanced info for Admins as the program is all GUI anyway. My only critisism is that there is little mention of any OS other than Linux, I use this on FreeBSD and I know others using it on Solaris. Other than this small problem I an happy with the book and recomend it to both new users and admins who need to teach clients about this desktop."
3,"Disjointed, But Fun","Arthur doesn't turn in his homework, then lies to his teacher about it. For this, he must visit the principal's office ... tomorrow. That night, Arthur dreams of a pickle world because of the pickle he is in. He wakes from his dream, does his homework, admits he lied, and turns it in a day late.The actual writing is disjointed, as most popular character books are. This didn't seem to bother the kids, since they asked for it to be read several more times. It would be a hard read for a very beginning reader, as it is a level 3 reader."
5,Good lights,"I bought this light set about a month ago and am well pleased. The lights are bright and battery life is good. I haven't yet replaced the batteries and I use the lights about 15 minutes each day. The only problem I've had is the front light is loose on the handle bar and wants to turn up. This should be easy to fix with a rubber strip.I passed a police officer (he was stopped) this morning and when I saw him later, he said he could see my light good all the way to the top of the hill. He said it would be hard not to see it."
4,Great product,"This product is great. The leds are very bright, it's easy to mount and holds firmly.The only con i have about it is that you can get blinded by the front light since the top part of the lamp is covered with glass and the light from the leds reflects and refracts in such a way that it shines into your own eyes. But it's easy to solve it by sticking something there on top to protect your eyes. Otherwise great product and design."
4,"great for ""be seen"" riding","This package works really well to let others know you're out there when it's dark. For me, it's adequate for lighting up my path for my ride in to work. I generally start out at 5:45 AM in the dark, but most of the roads and side streets I ride have a bit of lighting. If you're truly riding in the dark, you'll want a more powerful headlight. This will not suffice in zero light situations. Mounting was easy, batteries seem to last forever (I use non-rechargeables so I don't have to keep popping them out all the time). Weight is minimum. They seem like they'll last a while."
5,Outstanding performance!!!!,Great product!!! I do a nigth mountaing riding and I use this Combo Ligth Set. It is just Great. Great ilumitation on dark roads. A+++
4,Very bright lights.,"The Quadrant is easy to mount, bright and easy to direct. The quick dismount tab is hard to use and sticks even when the latch is depressed. It's feels easier just to unscrew the mount (it takes about 20 seconds). I think the plastic they use binds when used in the sliding area; they might think of using a different plastic or metal there. I tried different lubricants there and it still binds badly. The Mars rear light mounts on the seat post only. While it is quite easy to dismount, I would prefer a method to mount it on my rear rack since the light gets covered up if I put things on top of the rack. All in all though a good deal."
2,"Impressive, but...","...but wait a second. Haven't I met this before? The troubled officer (Red) reminds me of the ""Red Dragon"" (Thomas Harris). And then the objects left in the victims' mouths... Maybe the ""Silence of the Lambs""? And what about the mistakes and the ""holes"" in the plot? Yes, Starling is a promising author. But in Thomas Harris' books we find the results of tremendous study, experience and investigation. Starling has to work harder. Otherwise he will not attract the demanding readers.However, as a foreign reader, I found the language easy (short sentences, common words etc.). From this point of view, I recommend it."
3,Too violent for me,Everything about ordering and doing business was excellent. I enjoy murder mysteries but this book was just too violent for me.
4,"cracker, by thomas harris","that's it, really. Which is excellent. Although Harris gets way too much credit considering his attenuated output the last 20 years. Red is to be played by Robbie Coltrane, don't you think, and if the villain is more terrifying in the abstract than in person, well, that's to be expected. The emotional logic ties up, which is nice. Really good work, well written, I look forward to the next one."
5,Stunning Debut!,"I picked this book up because of the blurb on the front which said, ""The most terrifying thriller since 'Silence of the Lambs'"". I thought, ""What a bold statement for a book to make."" Believe me, this book does not disappoint! It takes place in England which threw me at first because of the different terms they use, but you get past that in a hurry. This book is simply one of the best books I have read this year. I have recommended this title to over a hundred people! No really, I have. And I have yet to hear anything bad about this book. I can't wait to see what else Mr. Starling writes. If you are a fan of Thomas Harris, Jeffrey Deaver, or John Sandford, I urge you to buy this book! You will not be disappointed! It will be the best money you've spent on a book this year. The ending is mind blowing and I literally had to stop and think about it."
1,Another royal Bomb from King,"There's absolutely nothing new or revelatory in this book that hasn't already been discussed to death in a hundred other much better written works. King is amateurish and superficial in the extreme with this subject, as he always is with his other books. I just don't get it! How does he keep writing these mediocre works? What gives"
5,One of the Best,This is one of my favorites of the Hinsons music. The songs are so beautiful and so moving. An inspirational cd at its best.
2,Give them the razor and make the money on the blades,Well Gilette had it right. The real money is in the ink!
5,Professional quality product.,"I was a little skeptical about buying ink online, but it proved to be very convenient and I received a quality product and rather quickly too!"
1,First Amazon disappointment,"I ordered this, as I have many items from Amazon and had not received it after 2 months. I cancelled the order."
5,Printer ink.,"Epson made my printer...Epson will make my ink. That is exactly what I got so I amvery satisfied with my purchase. I have tried re-manufactured and it was a mess.And Amazon's price was considerably less than in my local market area. Also, Amazon's delivery was faster than I expected."
4,Best price,"Look, if you're ordering this ink, it's because you need it, and probably, because you know it is the highest quality. So the real point her is that Amazon has the best price (or they did when I bought this)."
1,I will NEVER order anything from company again!!,The epson ink cartridges did not work. I believe that something was wrong with the computer chip on the cartrdges. The company that I bought it from only responded to one of my Emails and was NOT helpful at all. I sent the cartridges back along with a letter saying to please replace cartridges or to refund my money. They did nothing. Please help get my money refunded !!Todd Clevelandthanostc@yahoo.com
2,Epson 48920 *** Use before date: 02.2008 ***,"The product packaging is different than advertised, because this Epson 48920, mukti-pack's ""Use before date"" is February, 2008, stamped on the underside by the UPC as, Epson 48920 Use before date: 02.2008/6204CG.If I had known that the ink is out of date, I would not have purchased it. Can't take a 55+ dollar chance on out-of-date ink, so it will have to be returned."
3,misleading,"These are old, expired Epson cartridges that this company probably buys for pennies on the dollar and passes on the savings to consumers. All of the expiration codes are sctratched off. They seem to work ok and are cheap enough but I don't completely trust a company who is intentionally misleading and lacking full disclosure. It would have been nice to know exactly what I was buying. Caveat emptor."
4,multi pack color ink cartridge epson T048920,i haven't had the ink cartridges long enough to review...the shipping was speedy and the items were packed very good.
1,Awful product,I put the yellow cartridge in my printer and it hasn't printed right since then. Would not recommend.
4,dictionary,I bought this for my middle schooler. I like it because it clips into a notebook. I haven't heard any complaints so I guess it is serving it's purpose in the classroom.
4,Wonderful for newbies,"I absolutely love this book. I recently signed up to train for a marathon with marathonmakeover, and this book has given me a lot of information about the sport. Nobody in my family or close circle of friends run, so it gave me the advice I need. The only reason not to give it all five stars is because I have not finished reading it. If you're wondering about running, and are a woman, this is the book for you!"
3,informative but nothing mind-changing,"I have been running on and off for a couple years but wanted something to help motivate me to get more serious. I felt like this book was very elementary, some of it just common sense (don't eat too soon before running, increase distance at only 10% per week, etc). I would have liked to see more information about suggested routines and a more specific explanation about the types of foods that are good for runners (a balanced, healthy diet is a given). This is definitely a book for someone who has never really had any experience with running or fitness in the past."
5,Great book for beginners!,"Out of the blue I decided that I wanted to run a half marathon, but I knew nothing about running. After hours and hours reading reviews I picked this book, and all the reviews were right. This book has EVERYTHING!!!! Everything from how to pick out the perfect pair of running sunglasses to running when you're pregnant. It has great stretches and exercises to keep you balanced. While avid runners may find some of this information common knowledge, I think it has great tips that every woman needs to be reminded of, like how to be safe while running. I feel that I now have a great basic knowledge of the sport now, and I'm on my way to finishing my first half marathon."
3,complete book of womens running,"the book is common sense and its reassuring to read that if it hurts, then stop (you're not soft)and that comparing yourself to those passing you is normal but unhelpful. Quite practical tips but bits seem out of date or trivial (seriously, does shaving rash qualify as a running injury?) good advice on how to choose shoes, how to start running etc.. but if you are already anything other than a complete beginner this book won't add a lot of value to you"
1,Over rated,This is to much book for a lot of useless information. Most of the info is general info most people already know. Even if they haven't run before. I suggest you Pass on this one.
5,A Book for this Generation,"After I read the first chapter of The Hoopster I had to finish it. The story line is amazing and the clear images of the story will leave you stunned. The morals of the book will trigger your heart and at the same time tickle your funny bone with the all laughter you'll have. Overall I read it, enjoyed it, shared it and it has become a book I am very proud to own."
5,Great Photography,I loved the incredible photography in this book. I myself am a sister and I bought a copy for each of my sisters for Easter. The photos capture peak emotions that are very powerful and funny at the same time. I have three little nephews and would love to know if the author is following this book up with a boy themed book. Guess I'll have to keep my eyes peeled.
4,There is a complete and free online book,"You can go to an online concerning this excellent book. The free online book is presenting the online edition of this excellent Christian book about taking every thought and area of life captive to the obedience of Christ. Don't buy this book from ""highway robbery booksellers that set the price of this book over [...]!!!!"
3,"Good, but flawed.","I really like this light, particularly because it includes side marker LEDs which help with overall visibility. However, I'm now on my third light due to a design flaw. After about a full season of riding, the hook on the rear of the light fails due to fatigue and falls off...thus far it's happened and I didn't know it until after my ride (so no recovery of my light)."
4,"bright, britght, bright","It's awesome the power of brightnes of this little product, with 7 LEDS it makes the job!!! you will be seen at hundreds of meters.Waterproof and very light you will be happy with this, include a clip to atach it any were you want.A little dificult to reach the bateries (4 1/2 stars for this reasson), need a little screwdriver to remove the back, if you plan a long trip (a week or so) put fresh bateries and may be you will not have to change them, because they last 150 hr. (product info)in flash mode.Don't look directly at the light!!!"
2,Bright light but.... I'm not getting good battery life,This is a bright light and you will get noticed but the batteries are hard to replace because the case is difficult to get into and a small specialized screwdriver is required. I'm only getting about 6 hours of flashing light time and have changed the batteries numerous times. A single LED light that holds up to water and abuse seems to be the Pelican Mini Flasher. It is not as bright and fancy as the Blackburns but the batteries are easy to change and it's a tough little light.
5,Where's my maiden,"My wife kids and I greatly enjoy creating fantasy worlds and battles and romances with this line of toys. It's much more fun to be the dragon you've read about than simply read about it. While these toys are not educational getting down on the floor and playing with my kids is totally awesome and creates great connections for the future and, for the kids, knowing we're going to do that after homework time makes howmework time go a lot faster."
4,Diamond freak of the Sailor Moon Show,I'v seen these episodes and I definitely enyoyed it. It's when this enemy( I forgot her name) tries to collect these diamonds or crystels that form into one crystal which is very powerful and is to be used against the sailor scouts. First Sailor Moon has to get a new weapon to use against her new enemy.
4,uplifting,Great music to enjoy in the car going to and from work. This is the way to start (and end) your workday....Praising God.
3,Item not as described.,"I paid more for this item than others offered on Amazon because the description promised ""no writing"" in the book. I am now taking a class and find that many of the Quiz's and Excercises have already been completed.Book was in in overall good condition, but having answers written in hinders the learning experience.J H Lofton"
4,BigTurner,"This has a good size handle (9-1/2"") and a wide surface (5-1/2"" side to side). It's 5"" from front to back of the turner surface. It's nice and sturdy and is tapered to slide under whatever you want to turn. It's somewhat flexible, but rigid enough to pick up an omelet and place it on the plate. I am replacing an older Turner from Calphalon with this one and yes the old one got a tattered edge as I expect this one will as well. At such time, I will buy another for 8 bucks. If I didn't need to replace it every year or two, I'd give it 5 stars."
2,Melts way too easily,"I received this as a gift and liked its size and shape, but used it today to make hash browns in a cast iron skillet over medium-low heat and the edges are showing signs of melting. Would definitely not recommend it."
1,Too big and clumsy,The dimensions indicated one and one half inches so I did not expect to receive such a huge item. The paddle is at least 5 inches across and might work great for pancakes but is so big it won't work for much else. I found it awkward and hard to manuever and probably won't get much if any use out of it.
4,Canon PC980,"Bought this used,because Canon no longer makes this model. I completely wore out my first PC980 after 8 years of very hard use. I had purchased a laser copier, but needed the depth of a photocopier. Even ""used"", this machine still beats the other new units I tested at the store."
2,This is a perfect air conditioner if...,you have a twin bed size room. Approx. 6 ft x 6 ft. It cools down the air from 85F to 81F. You hardly feel any coldness if you are 6 ft away from the air conditioner. Placing 3 or 4 fans surround it may help the cool air goes a little bit beyond the area. I will replace this to another one has 10000~BTU.
2,Championship season,This video only has a running time of about 23 minutes. It is a very brief summary of the Ravens' championship season from the first game to the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl XXXV video is much better if you want to relive the excitement of the 2000 season. It gives the in-depth look that this one does not.
5,"Power, convenience, value and reliability","I needed a hand-held gas blower to rival the corded ones that I currently have but couldn't find any out there. I tried the most powerful Sears Craftsman available (25 cc engine, 205mph, 410cfm) and found that it had several shortcomings (not powerful enough, poor starts, turns off when attempting to increase speed, handle vibration etc.). I finally found a Ryobi 320BVr at Sams (for $75) and tried it out. Yes, it made me return the Craftsman to the store in a hurry. Runs like a champ and even has a shoulder strap to allow one handed operation. It's about as noisy as the craftsman, but lets you finish the job a lot sooner. Did not try the mulching capability yet since this is something I do once or twice a year."
1,Poor product...,"I bought this blower at Sam's club less than 2 yrs ago. It stopped working after 1.5 yrs and was found to be unrepairable. Warranty claim(the 2 yr warantee is a joke) was denied even though the engine had imploded. I would never buy a MTD product again. They make Ryobi, Club Cadet, Troy Built and some Craftsman products. Stay away!"
3,a dim dusk for Solo [no spoilers],"""The Han Solo Trilogy"" concludes with ""Rebel Dawn"" five years following the prior novel. What began as a promising series develops into a mediocre teen adventure where Han struggles with his emotions and becomes jealous of Bria Tharen, the former slave now a Rebel Commander. Forgotten are Han's past and other smugglers from his childhood.Several chapters track Bria in her quest to destroy the Empire yet end with a brief interlude explaining what Han is currently doing, none of which is worthwhile. I believe the trilogy is about Han Solo, not Bria Tharen. Various encounters eventually lead to incidents in the core trilogy (episodes 4 through 6) of the Star Wars saga but overall the series incorporates too much from other novels as cameo appearances and events and does not focus on being original. The hasty finale covers what occurs to most characters.A comprehensive appendix would have been useful.Thank you."
5,An enthralling history of the Universe's most dashing rogue.,"If you are at all a fan of the Star Wars universe, this is a must read. I could not put this series down, and I didn't think that I could feel so personnally affected by a Star Wars story. Han Solo is a great character, A.C. Crispin goes to great depths to explore and reveal why Han Solo was, is, and will be. Outstanding reading."
4,"Not the greatest Han Solo book, but good.","I've been in love with Han Solo since 1977, so it's not hard for me to love any book on him. (By this you see I'm not exactly a giddy teenager.) Good continuation of the trilogy. Bogs down a little in the middle, with all the intrigue involving the Hutts. Good integration of characters from other Star Wars books (Xizor, Guri, Durga, etc.) Lacks the ""introspective"" quality that we ""mature"" readers have come to enjoy in some of the other SW books (e.g. Planet of Twilight) but this is not necessarily a bad thing; it just means that it will probably appeal more to younger readers. Tip: as soon as you've finished this book, go pop the first SW movie into the VCR. Gives you a new perspective on why Han is such a smirky smart-a** (and I mean this only in the most loving, admiring way)."
5,The best of this series yet!,"Following behind The Hutt Gambit, the continuing adventures of Han Solo. Rebel Dwan is the best of the three books. Well written and a well developed plot. Crispin takes the time to describe the scenes and action in complete detail so that you always know what's going on. You seem to know all the characters personalities, habits, how they look, all from the way Crispin wrires it. This is a must read for any sci-fi fan! Just one warning: don't read this book before you've read the first two!"
3,Everything but the Cadance works great.,"I have purchased two of these items, on for my bike and another for my wife's. They function well and have met all of my needs with one exception. The wired Cadence sensor has never worked. I installed two of them and then had the bike shop take it off and reinstall. I even sent them back to Blackburn to get replacement, had the bike shop install the new ones and still, the cadence does not work. It does everything else so well however that I still kept the units."
2,Disappointing,"We love Jacob's Cream Crackers, which are made in the UK and which you almost can't find in our area. I thought these would be just as good (the packaging even looks like the Jacob's package), and I bought a whole case! Unfortunately, these crackers are not nearly as good as Jacob's. They have a strange, sour taste. They are not made in the UK, but in Brazil. Only one of my three kids will eat them--the other two tried them and refused to try them again. The crackers arrive crisp and well-packed, but the quality just isn't there. Jacob's, I'm sorry I strayed!"
1,"My thoughts on Boyes/Melvin's Microeconomics, Fourth Edition","I am a student in college who has purchased and read Boyes/Melvin's Microeconmics, Fourth Edition. I regard the book to be of inferior quality and sloppy. Although I can understand the concepts coming from the text, the writing itself is inherently poor. There are many examples of the authors misusing words, mispelling words, and making the text generally more complicated than it needs to be. To professors looking for a microeconomics textbook, please look elsewhere, for I am not the only student who has encountered these problems at my school. Thankyou."
5,Rainy Day Magic touched our hearts!,"When I read this book to my 6 year old boy and my 9 year old girl, they both sat absolutely still and quiet. This is amazing (especially for the 6 year old). When I was finished my son wanted more and even wanted some of the ""magic rocks"". They both wanted to go into the attic and explore all the stuff up there. Unfortunately we do not have neat stuff in our attic. I would recommend this book to everyone with an imagination. We look forward to more books on these characters?? :)"
2,Spits ink out on envelopes,"I have not yet tried to print photos from this printer, but I have tried invitations. When printing on white invites this printer spit black on almost on every other enevelope. It also runs out of ink very quickly."
2,not that great,I have had this printer for just over a year and I must say that I am not all that impressed. All the photos I print (from several different programs) are all dark. I constantly have problems loading DVDs into the printer. Just yesterday it took me 8 attempts to successfully print 1 DVD. And this thing eats ink.
2,Beautiful prints if you can get them out,"This printer produces the most beautiful prints I've ever seen. They look better than come out of a camera store. However to get each out I go through about 10-15 paper jams and printer errors FOR EVERY PICTURE, every time. Terrible."
2,Avoid like the plague,"I don't know that I have ever printed a really nice photo with this printer. The ink heads clog religiously. The printing is never true to the image on the screen, it seems like the printer software over compensates something, I always have to overexpose the image to get it to print somewhat close to what it should look like. I'm about ready to throw the dang thing out the window, shame on Epson for making such a poor printer. If you set the printer to print on glossy photo paper, it prints almost black, the ink density is so high."
3,Stick to DVD's Ron...,"Can't bring myself to give this book less than 3 stars as I'm a big Ron White fan, but this book seems to be an attempt to raise some quick funds for further casino outings. Most of this ""320-page"" book is size 12 fonts at an average of 1 double-spaced paragraph per every other page (always opposite a rather low quality caricature-type cartoon) with wide margins. I found myself halfway through the book in less than an hour. As noted by a recent poster, you could easily squeeze this book into a 50-page paperback. Much of the material is repetitive from earlier acts, although there were a few bits and pieces of some new stuff thrown in. I enjoyed the few parts where he wrote about his past, and how he got to where he is today, and of course everything about Sluggo, but must admit that overall I'm disappointed with the book. Stick to DVD's Ron, your standup is second to none!"
2,Far From Comedic As A Read,"I had recently seen Ron White on cable tv for the first time &he readily caught my attention for many reasons to the point Iwas excited to read this book. It was a ho hum read for me with very little humor and, not that I am vain in any way, but the use of the same four letter word repeatedly throughout his book got old real fast and lost whatever punch he may have thought it had. The photo illustrations were okay but took up alot of pages in the book to make this probably the fastest read you could imagine. My sense is that his audience would benefit far greater from viewing his shows than reading his books."
3,I Had the Right to Remain Silent...But I Didn't Have the Ability,"Ron White is my absolute favorite comedian. However, the book was a little disappointing. I did learn some interesting things about his wild and woolly past, but I've alreay heard all the bits and I wish repeats of those had been left out of the book."
3,Not what I expected from the Tater....,"I have to say I was a bit disappointed in this book. I really thought it was going to be much more autobiographical, but it turned out to be just a joke book with cartoon characters. An avid fan of Mr. White's comedy will already know most of the jokes, and they aren't as funny as when he tells them with his Texas twang, sipping scotch like it was spring water. Also, his efforts to thank his fans for the life of luxury he now enjoys comes off poorly, and makes me feel like a fool for contributing to it."
2,I'm a Huge Ron WHite Fan... BUT,"Many of the stories you will read here, are bits that you have heard and enjoyed. Even loved. However, in written form, sans his smirks, his smiles his spit takes his glass of hooch, they usually come up short. Yeah, you'll get a few grins out of it, but it is nothing like watching him deliver the same material."
5,The best router i have bought,Excellent router which installed and worked flawlessly. Have had it for 6 months and no problems at all. Print server works great and its really easy to edit rules and DMZ zones.
4,easy to use,"aside from the fact that the menus are slightly confusing, this is a great and easy to use piece of hardware. definitely a good bargain for home users."
4,Excellent for sharing high speed internet,"This unit worked great for the simple task I had for it. All I wanted was to connect two computers to the DSL modem and provide security against attacks. The basic setup was easy to follow and I had it up and running faster than a dial-up modem or printer. The interface is entirely web-based and very straightforward.As far as security, I ran a security check on it from www.dslreports.com and the unit scored a zero (perfect score).The only reason I didn't give it an extra star was the fact that the advanced options didn't have any explanation. The documentation assumes that you know what you're doing and what it is you want. In other words, it explains how to use some of the advanced features but not when or why to use them."
3,DHCP Server has some problems,"All in all, the SMC router is a good bang for the buck compared to Linksys routers. Its internal firewall had no problems yet and compatible with a lot of service provider's protocols. I've had no-name brands of routers before and had that fail me (email couldn't work through the router). I've had this router for about 2-3 months and the same problem comes. The router would kick off anybody connected while using the DHCP function. For example, one person is surfing the internet and another turns on their computer to log on. The latter person would have the connection halted while the other computer gets an IP address. The firmware is fully updated and the only solution is to hit the reset button. I gave it 3 stars for the price and functionality but DHCP addresses....look out!"
3,Connectivity,"Read most of the customers reviews and liked the price. This router/switch works ok, but the web site could offer more advanced setup information. My only problem with it is that it would not connect to another switch at 100MB, using a netgear 100MB switch or D-Link. I could only get it to work on a D-Link 10MB hub or the D-Link Switch set at 10MB. The throughput is also low. Not even close to 100MB. (Used Q-Check)Opening ports can also be a pain. If your looking for a low cost router/switch thats easy to setup and will not be using the advanced features, the SMC is a good buy. For me, I want a 100MB network, so I'm buying a different router. Remember you get what you pay for."
1,Waste of money,I bought this router just because this has print server to replace my linksys router which is working perfectly alright . without any doubt i can say this is the biggest mistake i did. the connection is too slow with the dsl connection i have that sometimes i feel dialup will be much faster. customer service is too busy to hear your problems itself. in short i have packed it safely & am back to my good old linksys router....
3,Qwest DSL and the SMC Barricade,"To get the SMC7004ABR to connect to Qwest DSL through a Cisco 678 router, the Barracade had to be set up static instead of dynamic. Run winipcfg on your computer to determine the assigned ip and gateway addresses. Running static could be a problem if Qwest decides to change ip addresses in the future."
4,Works great -- manual could use an update,"We've got 3 PCs networked using PPPoE with PacBell DSL. I give the product 5 stars. I knock it down a star because the manual isn't updated to reflect the new firmware; you've got to read the erratum sheet enclosed pretty closely to figure out how to set the thing up. (Since it took me 15 minutes to figure that out, maybe it's me I should knock down a star for being such a knucklehead...) Once you do that, though, set-up is a breeze, and subsequent PCs just plug right in. And so far, the product seems to work great. One note: the printserver doesn't work if you're simultaneously using a virtual private network."
1,Terrible,SMC does not make mention the fact that there product is incompatible with Cisco Aironet devices. Since I have an Aironet device the router is useless to me. Tech support is also useless. I would never recommend an SMC product. Get a Linksys they work perfectly out of the box.
2,Not worth buying.,"I was really interested in seeing this film because of the list of great actors and they did an alright job....I guess. But, the story line failed to keep my attention and I became bored very quickly. I don't recommend spending the money to buy the video. Wish it had been for rent instead."
4,One of my favorite Gilliam movies.,"This film is a visually stunning movies with great acting and interesting plot. I had to actually find out what the plot was on the web while I was watching it because it's not fully clear when you start watching it. I knew the basics but the plot isn't set up well at the very beginning that's why I gave it four stars.It is a movie that you can watch over and over and it gets better each viewing. If you like your everyday ""feel good"" uninspired movies don't watch this but if you are into wild twisted fantasy experiences with beautiful imagery, this is your movie."
4,Great Movie once you Understand it,"I watched this movie on a flight from Japan to Hawaii. It took a few minutes to get into the movie and understand the point it was trying to make. But once you got into the gropve it was really good. Great acting by all, sad and funny, and thought provoking once you had time to digest. I'd highly recommend for your home DVD collection."
2,Interesting concept. Just didn't like it.,"It was kind of dark and trippy. Great effects. Characters didn't have enough substance/dimension to them. If its supposed to be good vs evil on the other side of the mirror, Dr Parnassus has a long way to go to being good. Ending was depressing."
2,A fair waste of time,This is just one more example of Terry Gilliam's beautiful imagery accompanying his usual self-consciously incoherent drivel...except that this time he has also (the cherry on the cake!) decended into the slovenly and meaningless style of cinematography demanded by the current idiotic zeitgeist. A good movie if you have absolutely nothing better to do and want to see some pretty special effects awkwardly lumber by.
1,Visually interesting but NO plot,This is just a waste of time. The plot is not enough to waste 2 hours of your life. The acting is for naught an if you buy it for any other reason you will be disappointed. Donate the money to a worthy cause.
2,Have to use your imagination,"Ordered this film on Box Office, and was really excited knowing it was Heath Ledgers last film and that knowing he was such a fab actor that the film was probably going to be quite good. Well I was very disappointed, Heath was fantastic as usual but the film was absolutely dire, I just couldnt understand what it was all about it was very bizarre, this probably didnt help in me taking a liking to the film.Good job really it has Heath, Johnny, Jude and Colin in it. Overall a real disappointment :-("
3,Johnny ROCKS,"Love Johnny Depp but this movie is a little hard to follow, for me anyway. Would buy it again to have it in my collection."
1,Dumb,"This has to be one of the dumbest written scrips made into a movie I have viewed yet. And I have seen hundreds of movies in my lifetime ,but this is just one of the most pitiful movies yet."
3,Different from Previews,"The movie was interesting, but it is not as good as the previews!! I was a little disappointed when I viewed it"
1,Disappointing,This movie did not live up to the movie trailer I watched. I was very disappointed in this movie.
3,Berlitz is better,"I prefer the Berlitz phrase book because there is much more in it and little difference in price. Also stress in the suggested pronunciations is always indicated in Berlitz books, but not in the Collins. Still better than nothing when you're in the country without any language skills."
4,Loved this book -- beautifully written -- characters real!,"Wouk uses beautiful images and poetic prose to introdce characters you feel you really know. I got impatient with the hard-headed protagonists just as they did with each other. A story of pain and healing, love and sacrifice. Well worth the time."
1,Ear torture for parents!,"With all the cd's my kids listen to, I've learned to handle just about anything. This one is nails on a blackboard! I don't know who can listen to JoJo's squeaky, nasal voice piping out saccharin sweet lyrics without running out of the room screaming. My kids seem to like it, but I can't stand it. I just hope they don't start asking me if they can watch the TV show!"
4,works as expected,"I didn't get one of these when I bought my camera, so I ordered this one. Slipped onto the strap just fine, no issues, so I can have it with me when needed."
2,does NOTHING for pet smells,"I don't know what this shampoo is referring to as ""pet"" odors, but it sure has nothing to do with urine. it didn't do ANYTHING different from the sample shampoo that originally comes with the hoover steam vac. the pet smell was still there as soon as the detergent fragrance left ( about 1-2 days )i will not buy this again. better off buying a stronger strength regular detergent DEFINITELY no for those with house pets that spend majority of their time indoors. if you're getting this for a pet who lives outside and are only cleaning up the dirt tracked by paws, then you can take care of that with regular shampoo."
5,Great Pet Carpet Cleaner,"I purchased this for use with a new Hoover rug cleaner. This product worked as well as any I have tried to remove pet stains and odors. No traces of ""accidents"" remained. Highly recommend."
4,Hoover detergent,I used the detergent as directed and was pleased with the amount of dirt it helped release from the carpet. I was also pleased with the smell(I am not a big fan of perfumed smells)it just smelled clean.
2,Not that good.,"We used this cleaner in our living room with our Hoover steamer, after about a week of trying to housebreak our new puppy. There were accident stains all over the place. It didn't work that well, we did not see a difference between this and the regular hoover cleaner. The stains wouldn't come out. After giving up we went out and bought a gallon of Nature's Miracle Stain & Odor Remover, which worked wonders. If you really have some serious pet stains then I would recommend using the Nature's Miracle, even if you don't have pet stains the Nature's Miracle cleans non-pet stained carpet better than the Hoover solution as well. The carpet came out looking brand new. This product is a bit too mild to work on tough stains."
2,PRODUCT USED BEFORE RECEIVING,"My wife was surprised when she went to use this Hoover Carpet Cleaner, as the 128 oz. bottle was about half full. The seal had also been removed, indicating that someone had previously used this bottle of carpet cleaner. I can't imagine a company like Hoover selling an opened bottle of carpet cleaner."
5,Great Stuff,This cleaner works great on my law office carpets. Gets out stains fast etc. Buy this 128 oz. size for best value.
3,Kind of small but ok,"For the price it is and ok product. The gold is very thin, so you got to be carefull while handle it. Looks ok for a day to day basis."
2,I agree with Nick from CA...,"I was very sorely disappointed that these are only short little clips of the classic episodes. I wouldn't recommend this DVD for anyone, really. If you're a newcomer, then this is barely able to give you a taste of Rowan's ingenious brand of comedy that I love, and if you're an avid fan, you'll simply be as disappointed as myself."
3,It broke after a few days,"This toy was so cute for my dog's B-Day. The sound box did stop working after a few days. My dogs are small so I know it wasn't their jaws that broke it. Overall pretty much a bust, but made for cute photos."
1,Broken,I thought this would be a cute toy to give my dog as a birthday gift and when we got it in it was broken. No noise at all. Expensive toy for it not to work.
1,falls off,lasted about 8 momths then keeps falling off my belt as clip too weak to hold it on and turns all over the place too .. not going to last long
1,Didn't last long,This cell phone clip broke within two weeks of getting it. I don't think the plastic was very good quality.
4,Mantis Tiller Hedge Trimmer Attachment,Product works great! Night and day compared to the typical off the shelf corded trimmers. Very close to commercial/professional quality trimmer.
3,"Good, but not great.","This is an overall nice product, I also own the Reformation Study Bible, the RFB is better by a hair, the notes are identical as far as I can tell, there are differences in the theological articles as best I can tell. Overall the RFB is easier to read over the SRFB, also the side column references in the SRFB is not a plus for me, I prefer the middle of the page references, it makes the biblical text easier to read, this is another big plus for the RFB, however the historic confessions of faith in the back of the SRFB are a nice and distinctive attribute. The ESV is another big plus for the RFB as well, but overall this is a nice bible, seems to be well put together and worth the money. However there are better study bibles, and I would definitely recommend this bible for any serious student of history and theology, but I would say another sb such as the ESVSB or the Macarthur SB are good to use in conjunction with this and the RFB."
5,Very good study Bible,"The Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible presents opinions most other study bibles ignore,particularly in the NT. Both Calvinist and Arminianist views are discussed,as well as Pre-,Post-,and Amillennialist views of end times prophecy.This bible is a very worthwhile addition to all Christians' library,as is:The ESV Study Bible"
5,"Mr. ""Student of Truth"" is WRONG","Mr. ""Student of Truth""'s review is incredibly ignorant. The ""Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible"" came BEFORE the ""Reformation Study Bible."" Long before. This is the original Reformed Study Bible that was first pitched to ""Wolgemuth and Hyatt"" back in the early 90s. W&H went out of business and all of the work was shelved (much to Dr. Sproul's dismay). I worked for Ligonier in those days and remember how disappointed everyone was. Dr. Pratt secured the contract to publish it thru Zondervan, and it was. However it was published and the editorial work was done by Third Millennium ministries. The ""Reformation Study Bible"" was done when the ESV came out. Both are good resources. However, the SOTR Study Bible has more resources (including the Three Forms of Unity"", more articles, etc.) The SOTR is now out of print (I think) and hence the price. Ironically, it is SO in demand because it is a better work in a better translation, IMO. So choose wisely and with the facts."
1,NIV Spirit of the Reformation Study Bible,"What we have with this ""new"" study bible appears to be an expanded copy of the reformation Study Bible. The main revision is the use of the NIV text and the addition of a catechisms with minor revisions of the actual notes. This ""major revised edition"" looses credibility without Dr. Sprouls endorsement which it does not posess!"
4,Through Violet Eyes,"A great fast paced suspense novel about a group of people known as the ""Violets"", unique individuals born with violet eyes who can summon the dead. The ""Violets"" are a very valuable asset to the government for their assistance in solving murders, but now someone is hunting them down and murdering them one by one. I loved the book and was hooked as early as chapter one and I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series!"
5,Well written and structured,"Through Violet Eyes was well presented. The chrecterization was well done and the plot entertaining. It was easy to just sit and fall into it.It is a straight forward engageing book and there really isn't much more to say about it. I would reccomend this if you are looking for something to read through quickly and to fall into, on a flight perhaps?"
2,Another dissapointment,"I half expected that when I recieved the arabian halter set it would fall apart, I was correct. Firstly, I tried to put it on the Sahara Arabian mold (afterall, it IS suppose to fit arabians) but it didn't fit, then I put it on the National show horse mold, it didn't fit snugly, but it did fit, so I tried it on the Andalusian mold. I was so excited because it fit snuggly, but then as I was tightening the throat latch, the leather split and fell apart and the latch popped off. Somehow, I knew this was going to happen."
4,Quality ska-core,"Along with AAA these boys lead the hard edge of ska-core, erring more on the punk side than the ska. A great album that 4 years on I still put up with the ones I play the most."
5,If you like Punk-Ska you must buy this CD!,"This band is one of my all time favorites and this album is their best work. Every song gets you hooked, from the fastest ska ever to the punk to the fattest guitar leads in every song. Plus, the singing is so addicting you won't stop singing these songs in your head. This is one of the best albums for Punk Ska out there!"
5,One of the best episodes and an average episode...,"The Christmas episode remains, perhaps, my favorite Mr. Bean episode. It has all the elements of classic Bean... and it was the first episode I ever saw. He's up to the usual pranks and innocent mischief, and done rightly - he isn't irritating or misbehaving because he's a miscreant - he simply doesn't know any better. Very funny!The other episode is fairly lackluster, in my mind... instead of impish, he seems instead to have a vendetta - which is a little less fun (and thus less funny). There are some very funny scenarios, however, and while it isn't amongst the best of the episodes, it is certainly good for a laugh. If you only buy one Mr. Bean tape, I'd say it'd be a toss up (with either the first or the third tapes). Get two at minimum, and make sure this is one of them!!!"
4,is it dinner time?,"Before bed Mr. Crocodile makes his to do list. The list includes things like swim, visit the library, and go to town. The list also includes catch those monkeys, cook those monkeys, and EAT those monkeys! All day long the monkeys tease Mr. Crocodile, not knowing that he has had enough and plans to eat them! Will they be clever enough to escape Mr. Crocodile?"
4,Great with milk or dry,"This is some really tasty Granola. A tad sweet that's for sure, but the taste is great. I like it with milk or served dry as a snack. It could use some fruit in my opinion, so I'll usually add some sliced banana or dried cherries when I eat it for breakfast."
5,Completely changed my Investment Strategy,"This guy is right, you might not agree about the timing, but it's inevitable. Interesting information about oil subsidies. Enviroronmentalists would do well to read this as well."
2,Amateurish effort,"The title of the book promises insight into why, how, and when oil will reach $200 a barrel. Instead he uses a few graphs with primitive analysis to make his case. He says he is not an expert on the oil economy. How does he have the temerity to believe that taking a brief foray into the field he can be confident he has the answers that true experts disagree about so widely. In the reading I have done Hubbert's peak will be reached anywhere from last year to 35 years from now.It looked to me like he hade about 4 or 5 chapters worth of material but nevertheleess wanted to make a book out of it so he filled the rest with topics on the psychology of crowds and general observations about the market. Mostly fluff.The last few chapters provide sound financial advice on managing money in times of high inflation but none of this is new.Finally I was disappointed with his effort in general. It was poorly written and inadequately researched. I would have been embarrassed to charge $25 for it."
5,I already made thousands on Leeb's reccos,"When I first receieved the book, it directed me towards investing in oil and gold stocks. Within three weeks I made more with these stocks than I did all last year. I expect inflation to fuel gold and with the terrorists hitting oil rigs, these stocks should continue until these savages are laid to rest and America goes to GAA (Gas Addicted Annonymous) meetings."
3,lurches along painfully,"I got motion sickness reading this book. It is clearly written by an economist, and not a writer. Reading the book feels like driving with the E-break on. The book is full of false starts. The author lays out a whole string of lead-ins, and just when you think you've about reached his point, he jumps right on back to a whole additional set of lead-ins. It's like reading the preamble of a lengthy treatise, ""Whereas... and Whereas... and Whereas...""Worse yet, each whereas covers a lot of the same points. It makes it hard to skim, because buried within the repitition are the scattered pieces of new information, which could come at any time.I lurched through this book, trying to find the gold nuggets, but took away very little I didn't already know or couldn't have figured out on my own."
5,Stoked!,"This DVD is great. The great spectrum of riders. Different styles and different places. These riders find lines that the average guy would never even see!I just wish I had as many powder days as these backcountry boys appear to get!Amazing Freeriding and Freestyle manouvers. There is something for everyone here. Steep mountain runs, jumps off everything, railslides (anywhere!), Halfpipes and lots of style.Beautiful camera work brings you close enough to the action to appreciate the skill involved in some of the moves.The soundtrack is cool and good quality as is the picture quality. (No need for 5.1 Dolby Digital here... :-)).If you love Snowboarding, you'll love this!"
1,Plastic,"Difficult assembly, plastic parts. This will be the third garbage hose reel to sit next my shed. Which one should I get ripped off by next?"
3,Slipping Quality,"Easy assembly and good instructions. However, for the price, you would expect better quality. There are some plastic parts and the unit doesn't feel as sturdy or as well made as a Rapid Reel that I purchased about 3 to 4 years ago that was all metal construction and built like a tank. The fittings were also heftier in the previous model. The quality has defintely slipped a notch or two. Still better than the plastic hose reels on the market, but a disappointment for the price and as compared to an earlier Rapid Reel. It appears that a concious decision was made to reduce manufacturing costs, which in turn, sacrificed quality."
1,Product title and description meant to decieve,"Don't be mislead by the title and product description--this price is NOT for a 6-pack but for a single item! I contacted both acehardwareoutlet and amazon, and neither seems to see a problem. I call that intentional deception.The product itself appears to be high quality.I found the exact same product for a quarter of the price."
5,WICKED STARTER CD FOR THE UNANITIATED,"Well as ive said above the whole pulp fusion series is an absoloutely first class collection of music and one of the best ways for beginners to get into the genre of funk, soul, jazz and even slightly discoish music from the 70's(but try the Mastercuts Classic Funk cds first). The first two cds actually gave me the insight and courage to really kickstart my funk cd collection (450 and rising). Even serious funkaholics will find something on the pulp cds that were hitherto out of reach (try Lafeyette afro rock bands 'Darkest light' or Sonny Stitt's 'Slick Eddie'). And for the beginners amongst you try Pleasure's 'Joyous' one of my personal faves.All the pulp fusion cds come highly recommended."
2,"Tedious read, interesting idea","Only the premise of the story carries this book along, and I find it tedious to read. The characters are hard to penetrate beyond the surface. But I hate skipping to the end so I slogged through. I get a star for reading this one. But it is an interesting idea. The concepts frequently reminded me of issues in the Frankenstein story."
3,"The weakest entry in the series, but not bad.","The laundrette sketch is pretty funny, as is the hospital skit. But the Queen's Guard bit is just NOT funny. The mini-golf bit is ok, but really goes beyond its limit. This and the ""Unseen Bean"" (the actual final tape in the series) tape prove that the Mr. Bean concept was running dry in its latter days.Still, since they are currently charging only about $.. for this video, it is worth getting. The weak bits make up half the tape, but the other half is good enough to justify the price."
1,Disappointed,"I really loveClive Barker's Undying. It's one of my favorite games ever. Fascinating story, beautiful graphics, and great atmosphere. I was hoping for more of the same from Jericho.Unfortunately, Jericho was a disappointment. The graphics are very nice, but monotonous compared to the variety in Undying. I found the gameplay rather boring. The multitude of characters was cumbersome; they often got in the way, just because there were so many of them, and I didn't like being forced to switch characters just to get through certain levels.Worst of all was the DRM. Maybe it's because I'm running Windows 7, but it kept forcing me to re-activate the product. Every time I ran it, I had to put the disc in the drive and activate the game...again. What a pain. Honestly, if I knew this game was protected with Securom, I wouldn't have bought it."
4,Good History!!,"To me what caught my attention being of this game was its history, fascinated me, and buy it and from what I've played this good, maybe not the best game of war, but in history and graphics is not far behind, I like horror games and the creatures that appear in this are quite original, a great game!"
1,this game is worthless,this game sucks the story line is pretty worthless overall no one should ever think about buying this for anyone probably only for a joke but this sucks
4,Horror Game,"This game didn't get enough credit. Clive Barker is an awesome horror director and now has me sold on game plots. The graphic's were good, the story was good, and the game wasn't short. It was a little slow getting going, once you get into using your teams power's, its a blast."
2,Barney's Plush Bug Jug Pals,"I was disappointed in the product. Not very cuddly. Two year old grandson did not take to it, although he loves the Barney DVDs"
1,"For the price, not worth","It's expensive, and Inglesina has become terrible about customer service. At this price, buy almost anything else."
1,Heavy and not very speedy,"I just bought this hairdryer because I was looking for one that would dry my hair faster. It has not dried my hair any faster than the regular non-ionic, non-ceramic 1875 W hairdryer I was using before. On top of that, it is very awkward to hold. It seems top heavy, perhaps due to the new technology, and the handle doesn't fit in my hand well. I'm returning it and plan to get a different model."
4,Buena recopilación pero No excelente,"Considero que la recopilación es buena, contiene temas de mas de tres CDs pero no logra ser excelente, destacan las producciones entre 1984 y 1986 (sus mejores canciones bajo la inspiracion de Juan Carlos Calderón) Para que salgan de dudas verifiquen la imagen de la contraportada que he puesto para verificar exactamente los temas que contiene. Si son conocedores o expertos verán que para 2 CDs (33 tracks), la recopilación pudo haber sido mejor juzguen por si mismos. Si no tienen material de esta sensual cantante de los 80's esta es una buena oportunidad que no los decepcionará. Esta edición será dificil de conseguirse en un par de años."
5,old music ... good music ...,"see that this woman made &#8203;&#8203;in Venezuela where he started as an artist is an honor for me is something sublime and pure fire in his lyrics and voice, maybe it's my opnion because I love this woman would say very good excellent very good living others maria conchita alonso"
5,Excellent Coffee Table Book about Geocaching,This book is hands down the best geocaching book there is on the market today. It really shares what most of us love about Geocaching and that is the journey to places we likely would never have gone. I highly recommend this book to anyone-cachers and non-cachers alike will find this book inspiring.
2,May as well leave it at home!,"Better to carry a dictionary, one that translates both ways: English to Italian, Italian to English. I just left this book in the room about two days into my trip! If you want to go skiing or tent camping in Italy, maybe it would be helpful. Otherwise, it's easier to use hand gestures. The only good thing I can say about it is it's small."
4,Useful Italian Phrasebook,"We just returned from our second trip to Italy. After going thru several Italian Phrasebooks, I found this one to be the best. The audio CD that comes with the book, if you buy that combination, is also very helful. The Italian phrases in the book and on the CD are actually used regularly and though my pronunciation is spotty, I had no trouble being understood. Good Book"
4,To own is to know,"I-Robot is my favorite in this pack. Being a Asimov fan, I realy enjoyed this movie. Both sound and image are quite good As for the other two, well for me they are must see movies."
2,My Review,"I love Mr. Bean! Although this isn't one of his better ones its still funny to see him painstakingly try to make a sandwitch. The 7 others are also great, in order. Amazing Adventures, Exciting Escapades,Terrible Tales, Perilous Pursuits, Merry Mishaps, Final Frolics(why isnt it no 7),Unseen Been, Best Bits. It would make a great edition if u have a Mr. Bean collection. Also, ""Rowan Atkinson Live"" is good if u like him. My favorite is the Library sketch too, which can be found at the end of Amazing Adventures"
4,sounds like telsa,Iwont say to much differnt from anybody else except if you like telsa you like this album simply put
2,Very believable!,"I know poetry is used many a times in books to explain either the characters of something that has happened, but in this book i felt it distracted me from the real story just my oponion. This book is about Megan Tuw a popular high school girl who befriends the school geek or as they called her the freak when they meet each other in detention. The plot is very believable about Megan trying to be nice to this outcast Perdita and still wanting to be liked by her clique. As Megan hangs more with Perdita she realizes she is not just a freak but there is more to this girl. Megan finds out Perdita passion for poetry and things that really matter and not just how you looked.You could feel the turmoil Megan goes through and will fully feel her pain at the end of this book. Great U.S. debut for this Australian writer."
5,Security at an affordable price,"Purchased this safe to have a secure place to keep documents. Shipping wasextremely fast. The unit has easy to understand directions, 4 industrialbatteries included and mounting hardware with a mounting bracket. The valueis terrific. It includes an electronic lock and 2 keys. This gives you an optionof opening the lock if you forget your combination. The unit is solid and heavyenough to give some comfort for stability. I would recommend this safe."
1,"mirror, mirror on the bike","I bot this for my wife's bike. As one reviewer says it vibrates a lot. .But the worst problem is the ""expanding lock nut"" really doesn't expand sufficiently to ""lock"" the mirror securely in the handlebar (Yes I used the correct rubber gasket on the locking nut, it fits tight in the handlebar prior to tightening the locking nut). So the mirror fell off on her first ride. Naturally the locking nut is entirely made of plastic...If the mirror cost perhaps half the price one could overlook these problems, but @ this price...it outta lock better and vibrate less.One expects better from Blackburn."
3,Does not fit all handlebars,"I had great hopes for this mirror. Of all the mirrors out there, this one had the most positive reviews. It's a great design and somewhat sturdy. My problem was that it doesn't fit into my Cannondale F9 mountain bike handlebars. I repeat...it does not fit on all handlebars. I had to completely remove the tightening gadget from the mirror and file down the plastic tip for it to fit. Then I had to hammer it into place. It's seems to stay in place on smooth roads but wobbles around on unpaved or bumpy roads. I'm sure it would stay in place if it just fit my bike properly."
4,knives,"The knives are great with the exception of the chipped wood where the steak knives are held. It looks like it migtht have been dropped because there is a ""dent"" and wood missing. Otherwise, the knives are sharpe and organized nicely."
3,Not bad but not great,"Shawn Micheals wins the Royal Rumble (spoiler) for the first time, goes on to face Nash. thats about all you need to know."
4,A journey worth taking,"This is a stimulating book. Rabbi Hoffman is capable, he's scholarly and he can write about theological issues in a way that won't confuse, baffle or frighten the reader. This book is recommended for Jews looking for a way to view their religion in the context of contemporary life, as well as those seeking paths to improve their connection to G-d."
3,"I love the Roches, but","this is overproduced. Agree with the reviewer who singled out ""Christlike"" as the best cut on this. It's produced the way their older stuff was. Less slick, less compressed-sounding...even MP3s of their earlier stuff sounds more three-dimensional somehow."
5,THANK YOU JESUS FOR THE Commissioned Reunion!!!!!,AWESOME JUST AWESOME!!!!I ALSO BOUGHT THE DVD!!!!THANK YOU LORD FOR COMMISSIONED!!!!
5,I love it!!!,I love Commissioned and it took me back to hear some song I have not heard since childhood.
5,The flip side,"This film does a lot to explain and give a counter-side of the arguments made by the movie Fahrenheit 9/11.For that, I consider this a film of historical importance."
4,San Diego Sax Clarinet player's throwback combo,"Klich is apparently well respected as a live player in San Diego, but here in the Midwest, you'd only stumble across this little gem of a CD by accident. By the style of solos, Klich would seem to be a serious student of swing jazz, though this is a combo playing standards. This CD is worth the purchase price just to have their version of ""Lucky Southern."" Highly recommended."
3,"Boom, Bang And Hair","On the sixth Mr Bean tape, our 'hero' visits the open doors' day of an evening school, and he puts every single subject in embarrassment! He annoys people, yet he's pretty creative too... but, er, who laughs last laughs best, as you know... A quite OK Mr Bean sketch.In the other sketch, Bean gets tired of waiting for the hairdresser to get ready, so he puts on the uniform himself. Not exactly to the benefit of the costumers. Another OK sketch, but decreasing in quality.This is not the best Mr Bean tape but it's not the worst one either."
1,Frosty??????????????,"Uh, just for the record...FROSTY has a BUTTON nose!!!! Not a carrot!! This must be Frosty's lame-o cousin Freezy!!"
2,Great features hampered by quality issues,"The features for this heart rate monitor are great--the hourly chime, alarm, timer, chronometer, and of course the heart rate monitor transition well from workouts to just a great watch that keeps me on track.The huge problem is that the start button that helps to set up everything has begun to be rather unresponsive after only a week of use! I haven't exactly dunked the watch in a sink of water either, but for some reason the crispness of that button press is gone and now I have to try a few times whenever I want to get it to work.The heart rate sensor chest strap isn't too comfortable either, and it does take a little time with the manual to figure out. However, if it wasn't for the start button sticking, I'd still give this watch a good review simply because the features are great. Tighten up the quality control, and this WOULD be a great watch/heart monitor."
3,good but leaked,I was very happy with this heart rate monitor - until I wore it in the shower. The watch is supposed to be water resistant but moisture got under the crystal. It took weeks before it dried enough so that I could read information.
1,No heartbeat after a week,"I used the basic heart rate function for a week. The rest is difficult to figure out how to work. After a week, it can no longer find my heart rate. I changed the battery on the strap, but it still can't find my heart rate. It's an expensive watch if all it does is shows the time of day."
2,Not for me,"This item only works as a unit - not able to use wrist watch independently, not good for me. Returned."
3,be careful,It is not large enough for me. it looks like a toy in my wrist.I hate the chest strap too.
4,Great training watch,"I bought this watch to help me train and keep track of my progress (i.e. - split times, heart rate, calories). It works great and the buttons are easy to push. My previous training watch was a Timex (I lost the old one) so the functions are familiar. I really like the 'Review' screen and the information it provides on my workouts. I was hoping that the watch would be slightly lager than it actually is."
4,Good quality shears,"There isn't a whole lot to say about scissors. I purchased them to have in my emergency med kit. The edges are a little bit sharp, so I will probably file them down a little to ensure no snagging. Other than that, they are quite sharp and cut well without binding."
3,"Sharp, but have to hold them funny",There is a guide on the end that causes you to have to twist your hand oddly to use. Very sharp though.
3,Great book though the title lies,No one is going to teach themselves Samba in 24 hours. So the title lies. On the other hand you can learn enough Samba to set up a file system that Windows 95 can read in a day. You can set up a printer (which also requires knowledge of UNIX System administration) in a couple of days. The issue of encrypted passwords is harder. Despite the book's less than clear discussion of the issue if you pay attention you will succeed at this task.The book is poorly written and organized but it is indispensible especially on the topic of setting up Samba so that NT (which has encrypted passwords) can use Samba drives.I'd rate the book 5 stars on content and 1 stars on presentation of content. The average is 3 stars.
2,Assistance without Help,"The description of this book would be that it ""offers all possible assistance short of any actual help"".I now have a great background as to why Samba Exists, why it is called Samba and a whole wealth of other trivial things.The Samba Parameters are explained, but it is not made clear why one would use most of them and when.I bought the book when I was trying to hook a Samba server between Linux and WinXP. WinXP seems to have been an afterthought in this book as it is included in some parts but not in others, but mostly it is not mentioned in any useful context.The section on debugging is probably the best, and most needed if you try to install Samba according to this book, but then I already got a copy of that chapter free from a link on the Samba website.My copy of this book is currently gathering dust on the floor and I am using FTP to transfer files.Not recommended for Samba beginners, for whom I guess it was intended..."
4,Buy this one quickly!,"Like most other Americans, I first discovered Eddie Izzard on his HBO special ""Dressed to Kill"". Ever since then, I've been trying to absorb anything and everything associated with Eddie! I bought his video for ""Glorious"" and anxiously awaited his razor tongue and lightening quick delivery. I was not disappointed! Though the material is not quite as funny as ""Dressed to Kill"", this is definately a MUST HAVE for any Izzard fan. I find myself quoting bits from this show almost everyday. It seems that his material only gets better with each show. If your looking for an introduction into the world that is Eddie Izzard, then you must buy this video."
4,I need pictures,"As someone quite removed from the world of gaming (the book got good reviews, so I checked it out), I would have really benefitted from some pictures. Specifically, pictures of the two Johns and what Doom looked like. Otherwise, I enjoyed the read."
5,Terrific behind the scenes look.,"Masters of Doom is a great behind the scenes look at one of the revolutionary game development companies in the business. Starting from the very beginning, when the two John's were just children dreaming about games and hacking away at any computer they could find, the book chronicles the rise, and fall, of the empire known as id Software.The book, while it is based on actual events, reads very much like a novel. Much of the action unfolds like a drama.If you or anyone you know loves games, I highly recommend this book. It's an entertaining read all the way through.My only true complaint about this book is that it ended."
4,Everyone loves the little piggies!,"This book is fun for all age levels and is interactive, which I find is what makes it so entertaining. The pictures are beautifully done, and it is light reading."
3,Piggies,I liked this book. It is a different take on how people talk about there fingers. Lots of good pictures.
5,Given as a gift,Cute book. I gave it as a gift to friends that had a new baby. Their new baby has the same name as the author. They got a kick that their baby's name is on the cover.
4,"""Piggies"" a hit with my toddler and preschoolers",Wonderfully illustrated. Depictions of the piggies range from sweet to outrageous. Especially cute are the true-to-life drawings of a little child's fingers and toes. Cute book.
2,Finger Holes Too Small,These shears are well constructed and sharp BUT the finger holes are too small for a man's hand. The grips are symmetrical so they may be used either way.
1,Cheap garbage,"I bought these scissors to replace a pair that came with a knife set. I had previously bought exact replacements that lasted years and they worked so well, I rotated them to garage duty. I have two old pairs that still undergo almost everyday heavy use. When these new ones arrived, I noticed immediately that they were smaller, so much so in the grips that they are tight and uncomfortable to use. Today I dropped a pair (something I had done dozens of times with no ill effects to the older ones) and the handle snapped in half. Don't buy them, find another brand that didn't compromise quality."
1,card shuffler - 2 deck,"DO NOT buy this product! The one I received was defective. The cards are placed on each side of the holder and are supposed to shuffle INTO the center section of the holder. On the one I received, the shuffler tabs/gears were REVERSED so the cards shot out each SIDE of the holder all over the place!"
4,"It's good. Not great, but good.","Honestly, how great can an electric outdoor grill be? You aren't going to get a smoky flavor and the great marks of a charcoal grill.That said, for an electric grill it's very good. The grill got pretty hot (I didn't have to use the highest setting to cook up a very tasty chili-marinated skirt steak, and a pretty good salmon steak. The convenience is great, and it's obviously safer. And, since we aren't allowed to have gas or charcoal in our grilling location, it's the best we can do.The speaker system is fine -- nothing to write home about. It's weird that it has two plugs to plug in, but it's convenient to not have to have multiple devices.Bottom line -- is it as emotionally satisfying to use an electric grill? Absolutely not. But, for what it is, this grill does a pretty good job."
4,Comics For Mommies,"Confessions of Super Mom had me thinking back to the days where my brothers and sister would watch Spiderman -- this is truly a comic character hero for all moms who wish for something different, whether it be a new job, more excitement, or even just simply a new cleaning supply that would wipe away the messiest of messes! Birdie Lee is delightful and charming, even when fighting crime!"
2,Not exactly what I was looking for,"I am probably like most of the people who are searching for a book like this, I want to make something useful, beautiful, practical, etc. from the numerous ties that the men in my life are no longer using (for various reasons- changing tastes, or fashion, just plain worn-out, or becuase they have passed away.) I found this book to be wanting in the areas of my greatest interest. It seemed like too much emphasis was placed on acquiring ties, like how to word a classified ad, and where to look at thrift shops. I wanted some more guidance in the actual assembly of the projects, and this book just didn't provide that.I also have to admit I was a bit put off by the photo of the author displaying her 'creations' she gave the me impression of a gypsy. The items she made are not attractive, and not at all what I was looking for. I wanted a book that would show me how to assemble the ties into a pretty wall hanging, pillow or quilt, not a funky hat or vest and skirt."
1,Do not buy this bell.,I received this bell with rust and chipped paint on the under side of the bell. I bought this for my daughter but because she is still not old enough to not put stuff in her mouth I can not let her play with it. This is very poorly crafted.The other thing I didn't like about it was how loud it is. This bell would be better suited for outside use. If you plan on buying this for indoor use I suggest also buying ear plugs. I don't know how else to describe it. The pitch of this bell is nearly deafening.So basically if you want it for aesthetic or functional reasons you will be disappointed. There's really no point in owning this item. It's useless garbage. I currently use mine as a ponytail holder.
3,3.5 stars - A fascinating place to visit.,"Although clearly fantasy, I always think of these as mystery as there are always cases for John to solve but with clients and enemies beyond the norm. I do wish Green would do more with the supporting characters and the endings were not quite as abrupt-maybe the books need to be a bit longer, which would be fine by me. But he does manage to include ideas that make me stop and think a bit. These books are not for the weak of stomach, but it's a series I very much enjoy this series, and this is another good addition."
4,Pretty heavy stuff,"For those of you trying to find information on UFO sightings, I would recommend UFO: The Complete Sightings. This book, which is good in its own right, delves deeply into the scientific basis behind UFO's, and some chapters involve some pretty heavy math. Of course, if you're into that sort of thing then by all means buy this book."
5,Ho! Ho! Ho!,He is sooooo cute! I can hardly wait for December to fly him from my antenna. That's all I have to say about him. I wish there was a turkey for November.
4,They Don't Make 'em Like This No More!!!,"If you have grown weary over the glitzy, tacky cruise ships sailing the high seas today, buy this book and step back in time when ships were ships. No neon here, just lots of polished woods and brass, the way God intended. Mr. Miller's commentary complements the stunning interior photographs of most of the great liners and cruise ships of bygone days and up til present time. The NORMANDIE, REX, QUEENS MARY and ELIZABETH, even the infamous, tragic TITANIC. The high point seems to be the 20's and 30's, when Art Deco was the range, and the low point, IMO, the 50's and 60's, with that horrible Scandinavian Modern.If the book has any flaws, it is that it focuses too much on transatlantic liners, and not enough on liners from other routes. Still, it is a must for ocean liner fans. Perhaps Mr. Miller will update this book and include some other liners."
2,WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT,"This would have been a fine book if it had not ignored so many of the earlier Cunard and White star ships. The Aquitania, Mauritania, Lusitania and so many of the smaller Cunard ships were not even in the book. The Olympic class ships rated a couple of un-interesting photo's-nothing on any other White Star shipsFar too much of the book focuses on little known and not particularly interesting vesselsOn the plus side many nice photos of French and Italian ships."
2,The Fabulous Interiors of the Great Ocean Liners in Historic Phtogaphs,This book was a big disappointment - the photographs were well done and lad out but without at least an insert of the each ships exterior there was no way to relate the images with the overall experience and hence the sense of each ships history.A nice table book - but that's about it.
4,terrific...almost perfect...almost,"Another good dance album, maybe just a tadless soulful than past five-star offerings. here is the Descarga review:""Pow! This uptempo salsa powerhouse will hit you over the head like a sledgehammer. If the opening track ""Suavecito"" doesn't pull them onto the dancefloor, it is because they have been rendered senseless. This is Puerto Rican salsa at it's sweatiest, frenetic, most raucous best...A surefire, red-hot DJ Alert.Highly recommended."""
1,Warning- worst device ever!,"I am on my fifth Treo 700P, my friend went through 8 before getting her new Blackberry. I am waiting to finish my service contract to get ANYTHING but a Treo. Be warned! The only good thing about it was that each time it froze, lost sound quality (which is poor to begin with) or erased data, Palm and Verizon were good about sending me a new one (although I would have preferred anything else.) The sound quality is extremely poor - from either end. The devices seem to work for a short time, and then freeze intermittently, and finally, just fail. I have spoken with several people who have had similar problems. There is a great deal of functionality, but not worth the frustration, or worse, when it fails."
1,do not buy - wait for the iphone.,I use this phone with macintosh OSX and use verizon. the 3 other people I know who have this phone all have the same problem I have. the phone constantly freezes up and is unreliable. too many times I've been waiting for a call to realize it has been frozen and needs to be rebooted. I'm waiting for the apple iphone.
3,suitable,it's okay. not bad at all. suitable for a poster. 4 plastic pieces along edges of clear plastic covering poster and ridged cardboard backing.
1,Won't play on a computer,"Really couldn't evaluate the movie. The video was corrupted and unwatchable when I tried to play it on my three computers. Because this is the second time this has happened with a Halestorm Entertainment dvd (first was Baptists at Our Barbecue), my guess is that they've included some sort of copy protection to keep those dirty video pirates away from their precious copyright. Instead what they've succeeded in doing is ticking off a legal customer and making sure I will stay away from all Halestorm material in the future."
4,fuzzy issues to be mastered,"If you are an engineering undergrad, this book will be fuzzier than most of your texts. It doesn't deal directly with the hard, quantitative issues like finding the load on suspension bridge, or laying out the control systems of a satellite. Instead, the book's subject is far more subjective. But no less essential. Product design is a skill you need to master, and the book tries to help you along.Of the methodologies discussed, you might find the objectives tree and the evaluation chart to be especially useful. These can help you narrow down the design choices."
1,Junk,"The title says it all. But I will provide some detail.Flimsy, and is way too long. I couldn't get it into my mid-size tower. The things is so long it was hitting the power supply.I didn't bother to return it for fear that it may end up with another person. Into the recycling bin it went."
2,Not satisfactory.,"I was disapppointed in this. It makes clicking sounds as it closes and closes with a bang at the end. I have tried adjusting it. This is the second Wright product I've tried and didn't have luck with the other either and a contractor installed it. The only thing I like about it is that it will allow the screen to open to 90 degrees. However, this wasn't enought to make me continue to use it."
2,Great idea--some snags,"This is a great idea--the gravity-driven water fountain. So much better than plugging another device into the grid. However, it is hard to clean and refill because unless the bottle is empty, it spills when you pick it up or move it. So there are improvements to be made, but overall it's better than a bowl on the floor."
5,A great one,"Cornershop has managed to make a leap forward that's also beautiful and fun. Oh, and ultra-danceable."
3,Almost as good as Living Syndication,"I think this is truly a great album, almost as good as the band Living Syndication.. I found the lyrics on this album to be refreshing yet honest.. something which is hard to find nowadays.. Phenomenal production, and superior to their last album. They really re-defined their sound here..-P"
2,Let the buyer beware.,"20 songs (not counting the irrelevant intro by ""D.J. Alex Perez"") in under 57 minutes? Consider yourself warned: most of the songs (except the ones by nobodies like ""Zar"") are edited down to two- or three-minute snippets. ""Bailando"" for instance only clocks in at 2:03. OK for parties but if you like the songs (and that's why you're thinking about buying this, right?) just remember this CD doesn't give you the whole enchilada.The CD also brags about having ""video of the hottest Latin dance clubs."" Having watched the video, I can say the only way this claim could be true is if 1) It was filmed on a July afternoon and 2) They turned off the AC."
3,a not-too-interesting book,"I thought it would be better, but lacks character depth and plot development. Too predictable, not believable."
3,"Good overall fit, but a little billowy despite the velcro fasteners","I thought this was going to be a bit more fitted to my grill. Unless I really tighten the velcro fasteners, the cover drage on teh ground."
3,Works well,Works well if you're planning on making the roadtrip grill your at home grill (like I did). Otherwise you don't really need it.
4,Great grill cover,This grill cover fits very nicely on my blue Coleman. It is made of a thick material and is a nice black color.
3,Coleman Outdoor Grille,"A very well made grill cover that fits our unit justfine. It did blow off our outdoor grill when the wind got up to 25 miles per hour.So i put a bungeecord around the cover near the bottom,and now it stays on when the wind blows."
5,Good utilitarian set for the indoor gardener,This is a good set with strong tools and suitable for use at home. The carrying case makes it easy to use all over the house.
1,Smaller then I thought it would be.,Smaller then I thought it would be. expected it to be larger. Still can use it. I can repurpose the tools.
5,How to live a soulful life,"This thoughtful book illuminates the ways we can attain a more spiritual perspective in our lives, by pointing out the differences between ego (I-ness) and spirit (We-ness). Author Rebecca Holdorf explains that the Hermit is ""the Wise One isolated by choice who speaks only when properly addressed: when the mind is silent."" Holdorf shares relevant stories from her life as she addresses some of the big questions, such as: the search for meaning in life; increasing awareness of ourselves; relating to others; and such soulful abstractions as truth, beauty, love, compassion and freedom. What I love most about HONORING THE HERMIT is the way it brings clarity to the matter of how to be a soulful individual, honoring both one's own life path and all life, everywhere. I highly recommend this book to anyone wishing to gain a better understanding of the interaction between self and spirit."
3,O.K.,Is it just me or does this series seem to be running out of steam? The story is good as long as you read through it fast and don't let yourself look too closely at mistakes. If you slow down at all you'll find yourself looking for a red pen to write questions in the margins.
4,Paranormal Quirky Humor,"This was a fun read. The story was a little slow to get started and characters scattered but the author brought them together in her usual expert fashion. Katie thank-you for the great stories you do. This one is a mystery, adventure and a ablsolute HOOT. Readers do want a sexy moody vampire as the star of a story which you have given us, but than to put him in your crazy universe was fun. I loved the killer butterflies. Also the flower munching fairy(excuse me, model) as a supporting character was fun. Are we going to hear more about the vampire brothers? Will this family conect with others ? Katie please bring us more."
1,GRRRRR,"NOTE: Contains a minor spoilersPaen is shallow and self absorbed and Sam is emotional and clingy. But what I think irked me the most is his complete disregard for his beloved. Even after they had completed the final step, he insisted on treating her like a one night stand. And after pages and pages of her self pity at his behavior there was an anticlimactic moment of reconciliation. Let me rephrase that, it was an EMOTIONALLY anticlimactic moment. I just assumed it was another mildly erotic sex scene, but it was the turning point of his feeling. She allowed him to treat her as a one night stand and confirmed his presumption by forgiving him over sex. ***SPOILER*** This is after she bartered her immortality for the purpose of helping his mother keep her soul and looses her in the process. All of this turmoil was due to his distaste of having his life changed from the way he was currently living it."
4,liked it,like it and its a great series but make sure to read in order make them make more sence and like i said need more
3,cheap quality,"I was expecting this to be of better quality. The frame was undamaged from shipping, which is surprising for how flimsy it is. I was hoping to avoid getting a frame where the sides came apart. It wasn't apparent that the frame was one of these in the picture, but upon receiving it, I discovered this. If I was willing to deal with the hassle of returning it, I could just go out and buy a bigger frame (for the same price minus the shipping) and cut it down to size."
2,Happy to see the end of this story arc.,"I'm sorry to have to once again give a less-than-stellar review for a book based upon the Mechwarrior universe. Just as in his previous two books in the trilogy, it's the details that thwart the author's effort. Warfare in the Mechwarrior universe, even the less 'Mech-centric Dark Ages, could not possibly work as written. If an invasion force landed on Earth, there would simply be more effort made to stop the invaders. What sane person would allow the fallen Paladin to duel the Countess of Northwind as described, especially on the brink of a battle for the cradle of humanity?I'm sorry, but even *I* can't suspend reality enough for this one. The best thing the book has going for it are the minor characters, Will, Jock, and Lexa. At least their snippets are realistic.I don't wish to spoil any more of the story, although I would strongly suggest skipping this one altogether."
3,frames,You get what you pay for. The frames come competely apart and do not come together well. The corners do not rematch completely and they do look cheap
3,Great little single + 2 videos!,"Not a bad single in that you get a great title track and 2 videos which are selcom seen. The listing is1. Always2. CircusCrave videoOne second of insanity videoCircus is not a bad b side, just sounds like most midrage songs found on begins here. Worth purchasing just for the videos."
1,Epson V350 Disaster,"I purchased this product at a time when I was very busy. After a few weeks I had a chance to unpack and begin using the scanner but after only about 10 scans, the scanner bar began to slip so badly that the scanner became unusable. I was unable to return it because of the 30 day limit and now it is in the limbo land of a computer repair center in North Carolina. A huge waste of $130 for me."
1,suckes,all i got was one candle nothing else.. i left messages but i never heard back.. the one candle i got smelled nice tho..
5,this is another great have to buy comp from hopeless,"this is a great record. its got a whole bunch of goot tracks to keep you listin'in to it time and time again. bands like MXPX,LESS THAN JAKE,MILLINCOLIN. this is a have to buyGO BUY THIs RECORD NOW OR ILL have TO KILL YOU"
2,"Ok... but I think the ones I got, were old!","I bought 4 lbs of these for Halloween party gift boxes and the taste was great but the beans were tough, I normally love Jelly Belly but these were much more tough and chewy than they should have been."
2,Good story but it is not a book,"I bought this game for my 3 year old because of the great reviews. The games comes with a story and it is very cute however, you are not looking for a good book you are looking for a fun game.As a parent I look for a game that is educational and since of course I am going to be the one playing with my child I want it to be fun.well this game is NOT fun. There is nothing going on. you just pick a card and go, nothing is happening on the board there is nothing fun to do at all. Near then end if you dont have enough points you cant go through to the end and have to go in a circle forever. This is not very fun for me or my son.I suggest cariboo. This is a great fun game and it teaches counting, number recognition, colors, letters and sportsmanship."
3,not for a 3 year old,"This would be a fun game, but not for a 3 years old child. It says it is for 3+, so I expected it to be a begginer's game. I got it for my daughter's 3rd b-day and unfortunately it is too advanced for her. So we have to put it away somewhere and wait at least another year. I find Chutes&Ladders easier and more appropiate for a begginer. Now I am looking for another game with fewer rules."
3,Novelty gift at best.,"The fact that it was created by a child is a novelty. I did not play this game it was given as a gift, so I only have hearsay from my Children. My daughter said there were to many little pieces and not very interesting, her kids lost interest half way through."
1,Shipped quickly as described,"Bought as gift for granddaughters, sorry I acted on advertising, parents said ""just another game"" so similar to many others."
5,Obsessed 3 year old,"My 3 year old is completely obsessed with this game. He'll play it by himself if nobody else will play with him. Besides the counting forwards and backwards, number recognition, turn taking, and losing well, he's now learning to add and subtract from it by counting his aphids. We say things like, You had 5 aphids and now you got two more, so now how many do you have? Or, You have 7 aphids and you need 10. How many more do you need? At first he struggled with these questions, but after playing the game over and over, he's now able to do the calculations pretty quickly in his head. Wonderful game."
4,Out of Sorts,"Alfred Hitchcock's THE PARADINE CASE is an interesting film from this director. It is more important for its shortcomings and specifically why it truly doesn't seem to work as a successful piece of filmmaking. I have actually viewed this film several times and when compared to Hitchcock's impressive output of films during the decade of the 1950s it may be labeled as being ""out of sorts."" I think much of this may be attributed to producer David O. Selznick's screenplay and overbearing intrusiveness into Alfred Hitchock's direction. It does entertain but it seems to lack the familiar markings of an Alfred Hitchock film."
4,Stellar cast in good Hitchcock picture,"Pleasant and interesting courtroom drama set in England, about a beautiful young widow, accused of murdering her much-older, rich and blind husband, defended on trial by a successful barrister who, in the process, gets caught under her spell, eventually falling in love with her.Italian actress (Alida) Valli is alluring, ravishing, sophisticated and mysterious, as the lady in question. Gregory Peck is good as the barrister, so absolutely infatuated with Valli, that risks his own career for her sake. English actress Ann Todd is also good as his troubled wife. Others in this stellar cast: Charles Coburn, Joan Tetzel, Louis Jourdan, Ethel Barrymore and, last but not least, Charles Laughton, who gives an excellent performance as an aristrocratic, rather cruel and ironic Judge."
3,"I'm a big fan of Casio, but...","...I was a little disappointed when this watch was delivered, I must admit. It's not as easy to read as the one pictured, for starters; the numerals are not really all that visible unless I look at the face directly. The ""sweep"" second display doesn't go all the way around the face, which confused me a bit at first. The illumination is very dim, and it's only visible in a no-light situation. Of all my Casios, this one has definitely been the most difficult to operate - it's not as intuitive. My last gripe would be that the crystal scratches VERY easily, and I messed it up the very first day I wore it. On the plus side, it's lightweight, inexpensive, and it keeps good time."
3,Want to buy but...,I want to buy this book but I am disgusted with the artwork on the cover. Lawrence would be appalled by it. The text repackaged for the 21st century looks disjointed and not in a book typography style. Sort it out! Thank You.
5,"Yes, you can swim with it","I grew up with Casio watches in the 80s. This is an awesome throw back, but it's also the best ""don't care, just need to tell time and date"" watch. It's ridiculously light and thin so it doesn't get in the way. I also have the F-51W and that isn't as nice to wear. This does NOT have buttons that stick out so it's very comfortable and don't poke your skin, and the band is super slim. It makes for a very light watch.And I am here to confirm that yes, the Casio F-28W can be taken into the pool. I've swam and dove into 9feet deep water many many times with this watch and it has been no problem. I've never tried pressing the buttons while under water so I can't speak for that. But hey, it doesn't have any functions so there isn't any reason to press the buttons anyways."
5,Most excellent watch,I've owned several of these and the only thing that kills them is me accidentally breaking them. They are the only watch I can wear due to them having an all plastic case. Any metal and they will short out and die on me.
4,Can't self-replace battery,"Pros: It shows date, time, and day of week on one screen. Band is flexible and easy to put on your wrist. The CR2016 lithium battery is said to last 7 years. Very low cost for a good watch.Cons: Awkward to set time etc initially because the two setting buttons are tiny and recessed. Can do only with the edge of your fingernail. Battery cannot be self-replaced (back requires watchmaker's tool to remove, no screws). Watchmaker charges $12 to replace battery, which is what the watch costs. Better to replace watch than replace battery. You may wish to consider buying several watches at once to have as spares rather than bother with replacing battery by watchmaker. Keep spares in refrigerator to prolong battery life."
4,Loads of fun,"My two summer beach books are this brand new O'Brien and Harry Shannon's terrific mystery ""Memorial Day (A Mick Callahan Novel)""and they both rocked. Kevin O'Brien, with this one, scores with his best work since ""Watch Them Die,"" he is a master of the creepazoid character. Recommended."
1,Not A Buy!,Item lasted less than two weeks. The swivel seperated fom the leather case. Cheap. Could have destroyed the phone.
2,curve case,i have bought about 5 cases. three curve cases and two pearl cases. this curve case was not as nice as all the others. this was a dull black and not as soft as the others. didn't like it as much. others were soft leather this one is clearly not the same as the others. but oh well.
3,Nice looking but clip pinches in your love handles,"My BB 8300 fits nicely, looks good too but with one problem - the extra large clip pinches in my love handles (as reviewed by others too), and I am not a fat person. I would give it a five stars if it wasn't for this clip."
4,nikon slide copier,Item works fine with Nikon D-90 and D-70. Most of my slides required cropping after using the ES-1 but that appeared to be only a minor inconvenience as I did not have to copy a large amount.
2,"For Nikon, a disappointment",With a 55 Micro and a PK13 extension (recommended option) it cuts off part of the image. It also swivels where you have to keep adjusting it so it doesn't go off vertical. It works but it's embarrassing to say this is made by Nikon.
3,"Okay, but I was tricked","This is a good Spencer novel, but in my excitement to get a deal, I did not realize I was buying such an early in the series book. And although I don't mind ( a good story is a good story), buyer beware on some of these special price books!"
4,[Judas Goat] Spenser as a Charles Bronson type,"The Judas Goat is lively and engaging and doesn't get hung up on character development. Spenser goes to Europe to hunt down terrorists. There is no ""detecting,"" and the banter between him and his girlfriend Susan Silverman is mercifully limited.I came back to this book after reading several of the more recent Spenser novels and really appreciated ""Judas Goat""'s brisk pacing and straightforward action."
1,Hardy boy books,None of you e-mail back---It took way longer to get those I did get than I paid for ---I still haven't received the entire order I only received The Tower Treasure and The House on the Cliff not the rest--sorry to say I have allready paid for the entire late order---How do I get someone to respond to my e-mails
4,Great Buy!,"These books are perfect for the kid who likes to read! The only reason I gave them four stars out of five, is because they did not come in a storage case as shown. These are very nice, very durable books and my son loves them!"
2,washington cookbook,"I didn't buy this for the recipes to cook, I bought it for the historical information and because I'm descended from the Lewis family, and wanted to see the actual recipes. I was disappointed that there weren't more of the original recipes, in fact most of the book was what the author wrote about the ways of life back then. There were very few recipes, and the ones that were listed had been altered by the author. It should be called the Marie Kimball cookbook, not the Martha Washington cookbook. It was only what the author chose to include and what she wanted us to know instead of letting us read it for ourselves."
2,A Train Wreck!!,"Although this book did a good job conveying what the life of a child with autism may/may not be like, the story itself was very difficult to follow and the conclusion was unfulfilling. The characters were drawn quite well and the dialogue was realistic, but there were too many similar names to keep track of and the author recklessly jumped from time and place and point of view. It was actually kind of a mess. I wanted to read it because I am a special education teacher but I wouldn't recommend this book to the casual reader looking for a good summer read."
2,Longest Little Book,"This short little book took me AGES to get through. I constantly made excuses to do anything but read it and that is NEVER a good sign. Multiple sideline plots made it difficult to discern what message the author wanted readers to take with them at the close. The most prominent storyline was the murder of a little girl but the mystery is consistently overshadowed by complications in the life of the mother of the autistic witness to the crime. There are complications with her old girlfriend, with her old boyfriend, and with her present day loneliness. The trips down memory lane left me questioning the point of the novel. I am still not sure what the driving message was. The longer I contemplate it the more I think the murder was never the author's main point, but without that, frankly, I'm not sure what the main point is. Decidedly un-gripped by this tale."
5,Review of Baronet Pendulum Wal Clock,I love my new pendulum wall clock. It's very rich looking for a small price. I would recommend this wall clock to anyone who is looking to purchase a pendulum clock.
1,Disappointing apologia,"Libaridian's disjointed narrative makes excuses for the failings of the autocratic ruler he served as advisor--some would say éminence grise. Claiming confidentiality, he fails to reveal anything new; not that his ""revelations"" would have been particularly credible. One might have hoped for a coherent explanation with a touch of self-criticism. One would have been disappointed."
3,Very Cool - but gauge has become inaccurate,"I have had this for almost four months, and it seems that the gauge has lost some of its accuracy. It reports about 10% lower then actual consumption."
1,Microphone range only about 2 feet,I received the unit today and the wireless microphone only works within 2 feet of the unit. I called tech support and waited for almost an hour on hold. Tech told me there was either a problem with the antenna on the unit or the mic. He asked me to ship the Mic to the service center and they would try replacing it.What a huge pain... don't they test these units??? I guess not.Pat
2,grabber,I was disappointed in this product. It wasn't strudy. The button that is suppose to keep it from folding was floppy.
3,Gooseberry jelly,"I remember gooseberry jelly and pies from my youth. I really was looking forward to trying this jelly. I found it to be quite rubbery and overly sweet. The taste of the gooseberries were muted. However, a younger person who never had it before loved it and took the jar home. My evaluation was based on old home made jelly so I may be less impressed."
4,A nice little introduction to the world of Scotch Whisk(e)y,"There are a host of books on this topic. While this book was a bit more expensive then some of the others, it did cover all of the basics. It's about 80+ pages, so the book doesn't get into too much detail.I would recommend for the new drinker (like myself) who needs a first easy read to start learning about the 'drink they drink'....Enjoy."
4,Still going one year later,This watch is comfortable though a bit bulky. Date function seems to be wrong at least once a month. I would buy the watch again because of the styling and reliability of the timing mechanism.
3,blackburn bottle cage,Good cage that is easy to install if your bike comes with a predrilled hole. Holds 20 oz to liter bottles easily.
1,God Awful,I can't believe anyone would listen to this. My ears bleed after having to hear this band.
5,Another Powerful Book from Master Long !!!,"This is a great book - very interesting and informative. A must read for the serious martial arts disciple. I have liked it so well that I have included in my Listmania! ""Secret Self Defense"".Master Dutch Hinkle, author of ""Secret Buttons of the Hand: -21- Attack Stopping Pressure Points of the Hand"""
4,ADVANCED DRAGON'S TOUCH,I HAVE READ THE BOOK AND I FOUND IT TO BE VERY INTERESTING. I HAVE STUDIED THE HEI LONG SYSTEM AND FIND MASTER HEI LONG TO BE A WELL KNOWLEDGED INDIVIDUAL. THIS IS REFLECTED IN THE BOOKS I HAVE READ INCLUDING ADVANCED DRAGON'S TOUCH. THE SKETCHES ARE NOT AS DETAILED AS DRAGON'S TOUCH BUT THEY CONVEY THE POINT. THIS BOOK IS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO UNDERSTAND MARTIAL ART AND NOT FOR NOVICE. IF YOU HAVE PRACTICED MARTIAL ART THIS BOOK IS A MUST HAVE BOOK TO ENHANCE YOUR SKILLS AND KNOWLEDGE. I SUJEST THAT YOU READ DRAGON'S TOUCH BEFORE PURCHASING THIS BOOK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT MASTER HEI LONG IS TRYING TO CONVEY.
3,Pretty darn good,Although this is not a great book it is a very nice read. I found the names a bit on the annoying the story itself felt real if not a bit oversimplified. If you are looking for a not to deep afternnon read this could be exactly what you need.
5,Outstanding Textbook. Cheap Binding,"The first thing I did once I bought the book was have the binding cut and then spiral bound. Since the book is too big for normal spirals, I divided the book into two pieces, Part I,II in one half and Part III and beyond in another half. I had the index copied to be placed in both halves. After all this work and cost (about 8 bucks for the new binding), the book was ready for the wear and tear of being in my backpack. No problems after that!"
3,good but too formal,"This book is not for beginners. it is for students who have a background in real-analysis. It is also not a book to study signal processing, but it is more of a reference guide. I am disappointed with it, because I didn't get what I hoped to from this book."
3,Target Audiance - Choose Wisely,"This book is certainly technically sound. That being said, I find the notation confusing and the text relatively inacessible. The book is likely a good selection for someone wanting to study the innermost mathematical details of modern signal processing. Unfortunately, the text spends less time on actual implimentation and usage than would be preferable for audiances focussed on real world applications."
1,Smoke and mirrors.,"This book is clear representation of what these ""star"" students were unable to accomplish (namely David Burns and Paul Preissner) during their brief stint in Venice. This book attempts to hoodwink the reader into believing that there was actually a bit of experimentation in this so-called ""laboratory."" These pages of archi-babble prove that glossy images can go the distance with the proper spin. Also, Hani Rashid's blurring of boundaries, between the work of his students and that of his private office, is rather egregious."
5,Jill Scott's Symphony of Words,"Jill Scott is mostly known as a very talented singer and songwriter. Who would have known that her words, alone on paper, would also be pure artistry? I was pleasantly surprised at her craft. This book is definitely personal and reflects her inner being.The Moments, the Minutes, the Hours: the Poetry of Jill Scott takes readers on various journeys of exploration using situations and life as a guide. Her poetry is refreshing and very current with the times. Ms. Scott's words are clever instead of trite. She bends phrases and goes beyond simple metaphors to achieve a dazzling effect. I'm glad that I gave her work a chance and I'll wait eagerly for the next book."
4,Wife Loves these....,Very nice product the mount is lighter than shown but gives the stones much more bling so far they are holding up well.
2,14K Gold 1.0 carat Size brilliant Cut Cubic Zirconia Stud Earings,"Not as pictured. Stone is ok,but the gold part is very cheap looking, would not buy again... would not recomend."
3,Mmmh ok,The gold metal is very thin not exactly how it looks in the pic.... But its ok....Ok ok ok ok
2,Book Gives a minor review of a home based recruiting business.,It explains very basic information on a home based recruiting business. Almost like common sense.
4,Delta Bathroom Faucet,The Delta 544-CBWF faucet is one of the best looking bathroom faucets and functions very well. We have three in our home. Its unfortunate that Delta has discontinued this model.
5,"Fast uploads, what a difference","This card was worth every penny. I am not a camera geek, but there was a huge difference in the length of time I have to wait between pictures with this card. I highly recommend a high-speed memory card for anyone who takes pictures."
4,"A good, soild overview","The Italian Way is a good, solid overview of Italian customs and language for those traveling to the Penisula for the first time. While of particular interest to non-Italians, the book is good refresher/reminder to those of us of Italian descent of the differences between us and our 'cousins'."
2,Not worth buying,"Semi-interesting but don't bother. If you have a good guidebook you'll get just as much (and as interesting) information from it. Plus, this book is very small/thin. Not worth it."
4,What can you say about Planters Peanuts?,"They are what they are. If you like salted peanuts, these are salted peanuts. They are nice and fresh. And salty. And they taste like peanuts. Of course, salted peanuts are neither as salty nor as greasy as they used to be, but I suppose, sadly, that's a good thing.One complaint. The bag is exactly the wrong size--way too much for one person or even two people, way too little for a party."
1,Not worth it.,"As stated by others, the enclosed materials are cheap. I have been fooling with it for 45 minutes, and the gun sprayer is not working. I even tried re-running the lines a different way, to make absolutely sure there were no kinks. To make the sprayer work, I have to physically push the line into it with one hand, and hold the button with the other. It works fine. However, the second I move the line around and try it again, and have to jam the line back up into the sprayer. Thanks Saria, for murdering an hour of my life. I'm returning it and purchasing a real bidet from Home Depot."
2,Saria bidet spray converts toilet into a bidet.,"Product seems to work very well, however I ordered the product with gold tone fittings and received one with silver fittings."
2,Value for money,"Threads on bidet are too fine for standard american plumbing. Home Depot and Lowes do not carry 'adaptors' as described in manufacturers guide. I am returning this product as I havent received a response from manufacturer. I would like to emphasize that the seller was prompt in reviewing my feedback , contacting me asap, and providing me with a replacement bidet which indeed fitted on like a charm in 10 min. By the way, I tried out the T-valve with the kitchen faucet diy before I gave up on it as the T-threads dont span the way they should."
4,great printer for the money.,i just wish they had a wider format paper to use other than the 13x17 paper size for photo's.
4,"Funny, light and amusing","The thin blue line was a surprise for me. I've seen most of Mr. Bean flicks but this series was completely new to me. I am glad that I found them in the videostore. They are a perfect companion for a lazy afternoon, with a can of coke and a bar of Kit-Kat (or, to be more consitent with the show, Marzbar)."
2,Too much corn flakes!!,I was surprised with the unanimous good rating of this product. Guests at our inn thought this is strictly a cereal for very young children. We were surprised that the cereal mix had a large percentage of corn flakes!!
4,the voice of an angel,"the voice, the lyrics, the music, the performance.. take the time to listen and feel all of it. Unrepentant. Lilting. An uncompromising performance. Beautiful - the music and the woman."
5,The Battle of Midway,Being born in the WW2 era I really liked the venue presented by this video in that it showed both sides of the conflict in a meaningful way.
3,Communication; Making connections,"I recieved this book that clearly states in the title 6th edition, but in the information says 4th edition. I did not notice the 4th edition. The seller was great about refunding my money for the book plus shipping due to the misommunication, I am still waiting on a refund for the return shipment so we'll give that a little time to recieve."
2,rip off,"So yea this is totally a rip off, you can buy these boxes for 88 cents a peice at walmart..."
3,swing and a miss?,"When I first read ""If I Never Get Back"", I was completely enthralled with it. I reread it many years later, and still enjoyed it. I looked forward to ""Two In the Field"", and zipped thru it, but in the end found myself thinking, ""Is that it?"". It was enjoyable, and I liked meeting historical characters like Twain and Custer, but overall found the book a little disappointing. Two of my favorite topics are time travel and baseball, which is why I liked the first one so much. I have to wonder why this one is titled as it is, since baseball is such a miniscule part of the plot. And I agree with those who say it ended abruptly."
4,Interesting,"Two in the Field was one of the more fun and interesting baseball novels I've had the pleasure of reading. While nowhere near as memorable as ""The Natural"" or ""Shoeless Joe,"" the novel had a lot of heart and quick pacing that is great for fans of hardball and non-fans who enjoy a nice sci-fi/historical novel."
1,How Not to Write a Sequel,"Brock's first book, ""If I Never Get Back,"" followed in the path first set by Jack Finney: writing a time travel story that truly felt ""real."" It was exhaustively researched, interwove several fascinating stories, and to fans of old-time baseball, like myself, was a feast for the mind and the soul. It was a perfect book. I was not prepared, therefore, for the sequel. It is slow-moving, has very little on baseball, weaves a story line that is, at best, confused, and is just plain flat. Brock also succumbed to the dictates of the politically correct culture on a number of occasions (wholly absent in the first book): ""so much for gun control;"" referring to negroes as African-Americans; etc. And last: the book is in urgent need of a proofreader. In short, it was a waste of time, and no one could have been sadder about that than I."
3,Cute but....,"Although very cute and well worth what I paid, the box has ""2006"" on the front - This really bothered me because obviously it's 2008 now and there was no mention of this when I bought it.Without the ""2006"" on the box, I would have given it 5 stars."
5,Scientists are people too!,"The Cohens make a detailed case that science is not all that matters in a laboratory: how well the scientists interact with each other can have a great impact on the progress of projects. Further, they suggest strategies for dealing with problems at all stages -- from resolving initial arguments to defusing longstanding conflicts. These strategies include approaches for both managers and subordinates that take into account the power dynamics at work when approaching a problem with someone who has a different amount of power in the discussion. Overall, this book deals with a kind of problem solving most of us dont get taught in school that is vital to maintaining one's sanity in the absence of an understanding supervisor who knows these techniques."
4,Good Power Supply but....,"I'm having bad luck with power supplies. I originally purchased a 450 watt which said noiseless all over the box, and it was only about 40 bucks. It was really loud, not noiseless at all. So I decided to dish out some extra cash and this one looked really cool. I read some good reviews on it, an liked the cable design. But unfortunately, this one is just as loud, maybe a bit louder, than the other one. Otherwise, very sturdy, great power, love the cable design and uv lights, but what does a fellow have to do to get a silent power supply around here?"
4,Almost Essential,"The 1st disc is wonderful, every track is good but the second disc is poor in places and some of the collaborations on this disc are plain awful. But the 1st disc is probably worth the asking price alone so...you pays yer money..."
2,This movie is the height of boredom!,"There is very little to redeem this noisy, unfunny retread of surfer movies. ""Meet the Deedles"" tries to be like Bill & Ted, but has none of the originality or flavor that made Bill & Ted so funny. ""Meet the Deedles"" is boring, nothing but a mess of gags and stunts with a couple idiot villains and clueless heroes. Call me biased toward intelligent discussion, but you know a movie is bad when the most interesting line is ""Man, you are so diculous you are RE-diculous."""
3,so stupid it's funny,"The only reason why this movie was enjoyable is because it was so stupid, it was funny. That about it. This movie had almost no plot, but stupid jokes. Some dialogue was a little too adult for a Disney movie. The adult humor made it unacceptable for the little children, and the lack of plot made it unviewable for adults. Well, there still is some major humor in this movie and i would reccomend it if you need a good laugh."
4,Good snack,"I like the big + fresh peanuts in the mix!! Chocolate pieces in the mix create the surprise when munching the ""healthy"" snack. Not too salty for me. However, I can hardly see any cranberries, mostly raisins. That is the reason for 4 stars, not five.Btw, I paid $19.30 from amazon marketplace."
3,Base is rather narrow; recommend using the adhesive sticker provided on the bottom.,"Easy to use, but base isn't very wide; you really have to use the adhesive tab on the bottom that is provided. It's not often I want to use sticky items all over my stuff though. It's an average product for an OK price ..... buy a lot of stuff and the Shipping and Handling won't kill you so much !!!!"
5,Comments on Family Tree Maker for Dummies,"I think the book is helpful in many ways. However, I think buyers should be advised that the book is not compatable with some older versions of Family Tree Maker."
4,Love it,This book has been very helpful. I have learned a lot for it. And will look to it often for help..
4,Family TreeMaker for Dummies,"Got this book to help with my FTW entries. Have done a lot, but in the first few chapters, I find that there is lots more to do, like to add facts about things, like what is the source of a graduation from high school, or what is the source of the degrees.This is NOT a book to read from cover to cover. Start working with FTW, then when you get some data entered, read the chapter on what you've done, and you can go back and ""touch it up"" a bit for more interest for your family.Well written, and easy reading, like most of the other ""Dummies"" books."
3,nitro book review,"a pretty good book overall. i need some tuning tips, so i bought this book. it also go into other areas (suspention,wheels,motors,etc). a good read for a beginner."
2,"Somebody help me, my ears are bleeding","I have read numerous reviews for this album calling it classic and one of Run-DMC's better releases, but that cannot be in reference to this album. It is plain garbage. The rhymes are elementary and the choruses! Those were the worst. They are so repetitive I wanted to rip my ears off. The verses are incredibly short and the rhymes are not clever at all. The beats are also quite bad and bare. The only track worthwhile on this abum (and the reason it earns a 2 star review) is the title track ""King Of Rock"" which is a straight up classic. Just download that track and save yourself a couple of bucks. If you want Ryn-DMC at their best, pick up Rasing Hell, but steer cleer of this."
4,Not bad,"I work in a Christian book and music store, so I get to hear it all, usually a month or so before the steet dates. Although I personally think ""Potter's Field"" is a better CD, this one isn't bad. They are not in the same league as Pillar or Kutless, but who knows how much they will mature as a rock group given time. Just look at how much Pillar has improved over the years. The thing that makes me sad is when I see reviews of Christian rock bands by (obviously) non-Christians who just don't get the message. (EXAMPLE: ok... this band ..honestly just SUCKS and nothing more. in every damn song this stupid singer is saying "" i know i need you now "" ...i wanna puke i cant believe that some people givem 4 or 5 stars...) There WILL come a time when that reviewer himself will be saying ""I know I need you now"", and it will be too late. Eternity is a long time to burn in hell."
4,12 Stones,"I have to admit I had doubts about listening to this band, but it has enough hard rock and a touch of Creed to keep me coming back for more!!"
4,An entirely respectable debut,"Reminiscent of Stone Temple Pilots' ""Core"", though (forgive me) less ""Grungey."" 12 unique melodies, catchy, demonstrative of real talent, original, with lyrics that enhance the effect -- all of which invites repeated plays. Not a loser cut in the bunch, with maybe a couple (no more) that would wind up on my personal list of 200 favorites of all time. I'm looking forward to the sequel, provided that as this group matures they maintain their standards."
1,nu-metal with a constipated singer.,"For the record... nu-metal is absolute guano. 12 Stones, a pathetic excuse for a band, has a stupid talentless singer who can't decide if he's a rapper, a singer, or in a death metal band. They can't play their instruments either. They sound just like Creed and all the other mindless drones that can't play any original chords or riffs. There is no talent in nu-metal. Paul McCoy is a twit.Hail Satan.A twit is a pregnant goldfish."
4,Great First Effort,"I was greatly impressed by the musicianship of the band. Paul McCoy has a great voice going from soft to screaming (and he can wail). The axe work is tremendous Eric Weaver understands when to go from clean and soft to hard and heavy and helps accentuate the underlying emotions of the songs. Kevin Dorr isn't just another of those thumping bass players and adds bass ""melody"" (for lack of a better word) to each song. Aaron Gainer pounds the skins into submission and adds that necessary rhythm element. I will definetly buy there next CD ""Potter's Field""."
3,not great but not bad.,"The zoom lens did make a bit of a difference but not as dramatic as I hoped. I fit perfectly on the lens adapter I got and comes with a pretty cool case the helps protect both lens' admirably. The wide angle lens however was a bit of a disappointment. Once it is attached there is a ""cropping effect"" on each corner which looks like a black half circle. In order to remove that negative effect you need to zoom in a bit and that defeats the purpose of the wide angle. Overall I wasn't too happy with it."
3,"Less talk, more action","The set up for the story took too long, about half the book. Unfortunately because they could not communicate for a period of time, the men on the planet didn't seem to have any personality. I couldn't understand how the women got turned on by the guys. Much prefer a Jaid Black story which is sizzling yet romantic."
1,"Whining, Negative Outlook","All this book does is cite the negative effects of fertility treatments, including surgery! It points out how horrible certain patients' experiences were, without any positive outlooks. What a horrible waste of money."
4,envelope system,"I use the envelope system as a single mother of three who is underemployed and struggling and I love it. But the reason I am looking at these books is because I'm seeing a gentleman who seems to have to give all his extra cash to his young adult son/daughter in law due to THEIR lack of financial planning. The young couple is moving to a new house soon (my companion is concerned it is out of their budget!) and I thought this - or a book like this - would be a good house warming gift and perhaps a Hint Hint to all involved to get their financial schitt together so their father doesn't have to keep supporting their irresponsible spending habits. I am not sure which of Ramsey's books I should start with to offer them, but thought which ever is the most straight forward on getting a budget started and kept on track with the envelope system or something and maybe giving them the actual envelopes too. Advice appreciated from other readers here! Thank you!"
3,Common sense,"This book is full of common sense solutions to financial freedom. Having said that, you don't need the book if you have common sense."
5,Anything Dave Ramsey is good in my opinion,It has duplicate information from his other books but a very good place to start or continue your quest to gain control of your finances and get that part of your life in order.
4,The Best of Ramsey's Many Books,"Initially I was suspicious of Mr. Ramsey, who seems to repackage his few simple ideas that into various combinations in order to sell more books. The Financial Peace Planner is the only book you really need to follow his program. It is comprised of the most important points and gives the clearest instructions on how to budget your money. The other books are worth reading, but get them from the library and put the money you would have spent on them towards your first baby step."
5,Best tinted sunscreed ever,A friend of mine turned me onto this product. I live in South Florida so the sun take a toll on my skin. This product is great it evens out your skin tone and is not too thick or thin just right! I have very sensitive skin and usually break out from any type of sunscreen but not this one. I love it!
3,Rock-Lock is a hard nut to crack.,"Giro is made by Bell and is a nicely constructed product, but, adjusting the rock-lock strap system is a pain. It would be easier if it were more like the ""Specialized"" system. The way the straps come together below the ears on their one-size-fits-all helmets took a lot of adjustment in my case. At first, the straps were uncomfortable. After all of the adjustment, they were okay. The helmet will do the job. The visor was was also crooked slightly, but that turned out to be easily corrected.Buy one of the more expensive Giro helmets if you want a much better fit without as much effort adjusting the straps."
5,Great helmet.,"Finally decided to buy a helmet - after fifty years of bike riding I have become so paranoid of idiots in big SUVs yacking on the their cell phones that I had pretty much stopped riding. This helmet was priced right and was well reviewed except for a couple of people who didn't like the straps. I adjusted the straps a couple of times and it is now quite comfortable. Good value, fast shipping, and now if I get hit I'll be in wheel chair instead of a coffin."
2,One size doesn't fit all,"As far as I can tell, this is the lightest helmet in its price range, and it really looks great. If it happens to fit you comfortably, this is a bargain. In my case, my head is large, but theoretically within the size range this helmet claims to fit (it comes in only one size). However, it did not fit well. I could get it on my head, but it hurt. It went straight back in the box and back to Amazon. I would also add that I agree with all of the complaints of other reviewers about the straps twisting sideways. Even if it fits your head OK, that might be enough of an annoyance not to bother."
5,Great Helmet,"Great product, for affordable price.Nice and easy to fix to my head size.very good buy!!!"
5,Love my Giro,"Have had helmet going on two months and am so far very pleased. This replaces an older Giro model that got many years of use. The helmet fit my head perfectly out of the box,no adjustment needed, but if it was needed, looked easy enough, just turn the wheel( extra foam inserts are included for those who need them ). I did have to tweak the chin straps a bit, but no big deal there. The attached visor is very handy ( missing on my old helmet ). For the price , 26 bucks, and free shipping, it is just hard to beat. Shipping, packaging from Amazon was fine, as it almost always is. Gotta give it five stars."
4,Good basic helmet,"One thing I don't like is how the straps make a twist as they enter the adjustable connector on each side -- this causes the straps not to lie flat against my face (I have a pretty big head), which is slightly annoying.Having said that, I purchased this helmet as a basic helmet, and it does that well. It's easy to adjust and has decent airflow. It's lightweight enough that I don't really notice it when I'm riding and is good for all-around road and off-road use."
2,Strap Broke,"The right strap broke so now it doesn't stay on right. It doesn't seem like it was constructed well, like it was only super glue that held it in there. Not comforting if I was to be involved in an accident. I would buy another helmet."
5,Giro Indicator Helmet. Its great!,"This helmet is light weight, looks great and fits great. Comes with extra padding which i used to me it fit perfect.You forget its on your head after few minutes. It also looks ""cooler"" than other longer body helmets that look dorky."
5,Aesthetically Pleasing!,"Was looking for a biking helmet after purchasing a new Trek 1500 this weekend and wasn't sure what I was looking for..I went to Giro's website and read up on the company and it's history and thought I would try to see if I could find an ""affordable"" helmet thinking that these helmets were more ""high end"" and that most likely I would end up with a ""cheaper"" line but I was pleasantly surprised when I ran across one of these at a specialty bike shop for only $35! I tried it on and with the help of a wonderful sales person in the store had it adjusted to my head! The color I chose was white and found the fit and comfort of the helmet to be very good! So...I plunked down my $35 and tried it out that afternoon and love the feel and look! So for those of you looking for a name brand helmet at an affordable cost you can't go wrong with this line! Very pleased with my choice!"
5,brilliant study,Khosla's analysis of the status of untouchables in India provides great insights on one of the most disenfranchised groups in India's history. This sociological study is one of the primier studies on untouchability in India and is highly recommended reading to anyone interested in civil rights issues.
3,Not so bad,This is to my knowledge the only pair of headphones with the razr USB connection built on it without having to plug it into another adaptor. The sound is decent compare to everything i've tried before. By the press of a button you can answer a phone call and get back to your music after. It's also pretty sturdy.
1,Motorola Headset,Sound Quality = Very PoorHeadset Material = Very cheapI would not recommend this product.
4,"Sooo cute, but a little small","This costume is absolutely adorable!! It was a little small for my 90lb Akita, eventhough it was an extra large. But it got the job done - and he looked darling!! Not sure that he was too happy with it though! :-)"
4,A Gentle Reflection on the Life by a Remarkable Woman,"So many stars' biographies describe painful recollection and induce sadness and pity. Not Carol's! Carol's childhood was not an easy one, but she describes it poignantly, lovingly, and truthfully, without a trace of bitterness or sadness. I highly recommend the audio version, because the author herself reads it beautifully and affectionately. It is an unforgettable experience."
5,Excellent read.,Excellent read. You actually feel as though Carol was someone you grew up with. I was sad when I was done with the book - I didn't want to part.
5,What Blu-Ray Was Made For,This Nat Geo feature was right up my alley. The quality of its production shines extraordinary on HD televisions. Definitely a must-see for anyone with intelligence & a craving for stunning graphics. The bonus asteroid feature was a nice addition as well.
2,Shoddy scholarship,"Roberts has achieved nothing but a perfectly condescending caricature of the Czech people. It is completely incomprehensible, how he could collect so much data and not gain any understanding of the culture. Mr. Roberts sees everything as a communist propaganda, and has difficulty imagining that people could have had any joy in their life during communism. My absolute favorite: the Czech's love of smoking, according to Mr. Roberts apparently stems, ""from the fact that there was so little to live for under communism."" But then again how can one expect any depth or intellectual rigor from a writer who claims that his bibliography is lacking because ""it would be impossible to cite all the works..."" REALLY?"
5,African Wild Dog plush toy,I bought this stuffed animal for my 9 year old son who was doing an oral report in front of the class on the African Wild Dog. I was surprised that I could even find a stuffed African Wild Dog. It looks great and has all the features of a real one. He used it to tell about the physical characteristics of the animal and it was a perfect representation. He loves it and sleeps with it every night. It is sewn very well and seems pretty durable. He got an A+ on his report too!
5,Plain Fun,"Plain fun for collecting, or even playing! I love how the same breeds come in different colors, and even markings!"
5,Very Nice,Better alternative to OXO though the selection is very limited. Well constructed and made in China.
5,Wonderful book!,Exercising Through Your Pregnancy is by far one of the best books I've read! It contains such detailed information. It's written well and is easy to follow along. Best time to read it is before you get pregnant! Will calm all your fears regarding exercising. A must for any woman who truly cares about staying healthy during her pregnancy!
5,Great book!,"As somewhat of an information junkie, I found the ""take it easy"" advice to my questions about exercising during pregnancy totally unacceptable. From my OB to my midwife to my trainer, I got conflicting advice with no data to back it up Nobody could tell me anything other than ""it might hurt the baby."" Clapp details why, for most active women, that is just poppycock! This is a must-read not only to active women. But health care providers and trainers who advise them as well."
2,Nothing useful or path breaking in this book,"Title of the book is misleading. I thought it would help me with ""small talk"" but there are only 4-5 pages about that. ALL of the book is common sense stuff with nothing special to help you in small talk situations."
1,Very disappointing,"I geuss maybe I didn't quite understand the description of this book because it was not what I expected. The different chapters gave examples of what could be said in one-on-one conversations. It did not help me as much as some other books such as ""Conversationally Speaking"". If you need help with conversation skills and social anxiety disorder, this is not the book for you."
3,In the Tradition,"In the tradition of talented African American, West Indian, Black!! writers, Lois weaves poetry, parable smoothly ritually and rhythmically. Some parts will shock, make you laugh out loud and THINK. A truly honest book that makes you think. I read it in two days, when I wasn't reading it, I was wondering what the characters were doing. Then I realized I didn't really know these people!! This is how 3 dimensional her characters are. I love the language. Raw, but not profane. As good as this book was, I see a huge potential for growth. And who ever did that heavenly cover... beautiful!!"
1,How not to write a book.,"I concur with most of the other reviews, this book is trash. For the record, I do admire Jesse Livermore. However, this author editorialized on literally almost every page. He exhibits this antipathy toward Livermore that detracts from what little information is actually there. I have a journalism degree, and was taught not to let my personal opinion show in my writing. Apparently this author never studied writing."
4,garage band music. frat music.,"Like many artists doing garage band frat rock in the early 1960's this is mainly a cover album of other artists material. Most of which sounds decent. And of course you get the hit single ""jolly green giant"" and the totally cool song 'that's cool that's trash"". If you enjoy early sixties garage music that is not punky but fun and fratty then you will enjoy most of this disc. At least it's recorded in stereo and that helps, and this is the type of recording where they just played live in the studio without overdubs. That was what most recording was like then. I liked this disc because I like this kind of music."
5,Controla la situacion con facilidad,"Los libros de Richard Carlson se caracterizan porque nos hacen ver y entender cada situacion de una manera que la podemos manejar, sin dejar de perder el control. Muchas veces pensamos que los problemas o ciertas situaciones son gigantes, abominables, y que no podemos resolverlos. En este libro aprendemos a conocer las herramientas que se encuentran dentro de nosotros mismos para hacer cierta situación más llevadera, para analizar objetivamente cada aspecto del problema y planificar como resolver cada uno de esos aspectos. Aprendemos también a no sentirnos afectados por comentarios de terceras personas. Aprendemos a resolver conflictos con confianza, optimismo y facilidad."
2,Wasn't what I was hoping for...,"I was looking for a book that would show some really good red salsa recipes. This one has I think 2 total. The rest are not what I would call 'salsa'. But maybe that's because I'm just a hick from Missouri. If you call just about anything mixed up in a bowl 'salsa' then you might like this book, personally I didn't think it was worth the shipping cost."
4,"Simple, low-fat, delicious salsas. Makes food taste great.","Great pictures and easy to follow recipes that take about 10-20 minutes. Full of all different varieties of salsas (veggie, corn, bean, nut, seafood, & exotic). The most helpful part is list after the recipe telling you what type of food your salsa would go well with. I bought the book last week and have made 3 different salsas already. I even bought a second copy to give to a friend."
3,Silly Dramedy Hits Close to Home,"The hilarious and daring ""But I'm a Cheerleader"" is silly at first but moves on to become this heavy handed drama. The thing that is so great about it is that it is so true. I went to a church related program to ""change"" myself and I came out (no punn intended) just like this young girl. Because I went through something like this, it makes this movie much more than a silly dramedy for me."
4,"Sweet story, fun movie","This film features a neat, quirky score and ten minutes of closeups on different cheerleader body parts. What's not to like? But seriously, it's an interesting movie with a nice message and a sweet story. As you might already suspect, Natasha Lyonne and Clea Duvall each shines in her role. Definitely worth the time."
5,The Most Brilliant Movie,"My sister and her friends were watching this. It was really funny. The best part was the ""straight is great"" camp. Those people were only there because other people thought they were gay--not because they necessarily were. Those people thought they were gay because they were stereotypes. It kind of reminded me of school. How everyone judges other people. I think this movie did an awesome job at making people see how stupid judging people is."
3,Disappointed,"I Bought the DVD because everyone's saying nice things about the movie, I think it was long, boring and not really funny. I like it okay but Im a bit disappointed, I don't think I would watch it again unless my friends want me to watch it with her."
2,not for adult daughters and mothers,"After hearing Christiane on PBS I really thought the c d package would be directed at developing a friendship with your mother after reaching adulthood. Why they act the way they do, how to see their words and actions through their eyes, understanding them and letting the pain they cause drop away. But this c d is directed at mothers with girls still living at home. How to raise them so they have self pride, integrity and can handle finances. Only the first tape talked about mothers and daughters over 35. It was a waste of my money."
1,Reads like a junior high school students essay on the gheto,"I was so disapointed. the writing style is simply crap. i've read bad novels by amateur writers, but nothing like this. cliche after cliche, until you think there cannot be anymore and then there is. if i had to read one more of Soulban's characters say ""word"" and ""back in the day"" i would have killed myself. after ""Hunger Like Fire"" i didn't even bother to research this book, and ordered it. i realize they are by diffeent writers, but as far as genre fiction goes, i felt it was a safe purchase. i was just floored to realize someone would write such a one dimensional ""gansta"" novel based in the world of darkness. if i possesed the ability to erase the experience of reading this book, i would.i beg any reader that values their brain to give this one a skip."
2,Mislabeled product.,"The product in this container is NOT Wet Light, but regular wet, and I don't like it!!! I will not waste my time returning it."
2,Just Okay!,"I purchased the Twin Cuisine Cheese Plane to complement my Henckel's Twin Cuisine Cheese Knife (see my review). Unfortunately, this Plane does not work as well as I had hoped. I happen to have an OXO Cheese Plane that works great. The Twin Cuisine Plane does not shave the thin cheese slices as well as the OXO Plane. Perhaps it is because of the serrated cutting edge. The slices are not very uniform and often break apart midway through the slicing process. The Plane looks cool alongside its sister cheese knife, but does not work as well as other cheese planes."
4,Exactly what I needed,"I bought this walker 3 times! I bought it for my first daughter because it was inexpensive. She grew into it and out of it quickly so I was glad I didn't buy a more expensive brand. I bought it for my next 2 daughters because my first daughter loved it so much when she was in it. It's very sturdy and the print hid a stain that got on it very well. The toy bar kept my girls interested and it conveniently comes off as well. It callapses to almost flat for very convenient storage. If I had to buy another walker, I would buy this one over and over again."
1,Trend Walker with Toy Bar - Bears,Bought this item for my Grandson only to find out afterwards that the item has been recalled. This item should not even be listed. Tried to get a refund from Amazon but they only gave me a gift certificate.
4,Hot! Hot!,I bought all four of Harris' books and liked each one of them. Smoldering investigated a fatal fire and the police work contained in the book was so real. Harris writes about the same characters in each book - I learned a little more about each person in each story. Harris writes in an easy and straight forward style without adding boring detail. She keeps you on track as you quickly turn the pages.
5,Captivating!!!,"Ruby is the best Mary Rain book yet. It is captivating and keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to read more. This is a book that you don't just read... you experience it as you read it. It is tho you are right there experiencing everything that goes on.... a really touching book!!!! It makes you wonder if you see with your eyes or with your mind! It leaves you with the thought there is more to come, I can't wait!!! This will give you hours of great reading and make a great addition to any library. It is a must have book! Edith F"
3,Jar City,"After the Wallander book which I read following the film, I found this quite disappointing.However, against such a high standard it might be described as an easy bed-time read, easy to put down.Being Anglo-centric I found it difficult to remember the characters. I'd have liked a little more cultural background throughout the story because the crime fiction from the Scandanavian countries has appeal.Worth the purchase price."
4,Iceland Cometh,"I enjoyed this book well enough to order another of the author's works. It was well-written and suspenseful. I like reading about different places and this was a good introduction to Iceland. I'm reading his next book, Silence of the Grave, now and enjoying it as well. The characters are interesting, enough to love or hate. The plot final outcomes aren't transparent and so the impetus is there to continue reading until you have the answers!"
4,Jar City,I put aside everything else until I had finished reading this book. The writer takes you on a journey into an unknown world.
4,a jarring thriller,"among scandinavian thriller-writers, this young icelandic novelist is one of the most promising. the plot is interesting, and raises important questions about scientific data bases and many other issues. but the novel is best for its bleak atmosphere and melancholy characterization. not really fun, but it grabs you and won't let go."
5,Good one,"I think it works pretty good. But a little noisy. Apart from that, it's a great product. I like it."
1,DANGEROUS,We used it for several months this winter without any problems. It worked great! Then this morning we walked into our 11month old son's room at the heater was up to 98degrees! Obviously we hadn't set it this high and having used it for several months without any problems leads me to think that there wasn't any user error. I saw other posts with similar problems. I'm on the phone right now with customer support to see what they have to say about this.--> Basically they want me to send it back to them (at my expense) and they will send me a newer model (at their expense). They say that they have never had this problem before. I don't believe them.
1,omg- so overpriced!!,i had no choice cuz i was having a party and needed a lot of these. i ordered one pound for 13.00. that is llike 2 cups worth--- wayyy too expensive and i would NOT buy here again.
5,Awesome Praise & Worship Experience,"If you miss that old time praise and worship music. Then this is just the cd for you!I searched long and hard for a praise and worship cd that would allow me and my family to praise the Lord together.I love all the songs on this cd and each of my girls has selected their favorite too.You will be impressed with the depth and how each song causes you to think on our Heavenly Father and each time we listen to it, I am reminded of new things He deserves our praise for.An excellent Christmas present or for any occasion."
4,this man is sick,yo this album is sick...shyne kills it on everytrack with his raw ability and his way to make you see what he is sayin...this man is sick...i recomend this album to anyone who had his first album and thought it was raw he tops it on this joint...cop it fools
3,"Shyne's got talent, but the album could be better","Shyne should have never signed with Bad Boy. It's messed up what Puff and the courts did to him. He definitely has the skills to make it on his own, and Gangland Records was a step in the right direction. I'm positive that when he's released from prison he'll drop some hot sh*t. As for this album, you get the feeling it was thrown together in a hurry with makeshift songs. I wonder why that is? Anywayz, This album has some serious tracks, but the rest of the quality is somewhat poor. Although it's still good to hear Shyne's gritty N.Y. voice, there are plenty of tracks which could have been executed better. Best Tracks: The Gang, More or Less, Quasi O.G., and you gotta hear him tear up 50 on For the Record."
4,OK,"This album is not really a cohesive album at all. This is more fitted for a mixtape, but you got to make that money. The songs were hot though. The are a couple of annoying songs on here like that Daz and Kurupt joint and Jimmy Choo. Except for those, this is not that badTop 3 Songs: Quasi O.G, The Gang, Diamonds and Mac 10sBottom 3 Songs: Jimmy Choo, Behind the Walls, GodfatherSleeper: Here with Me"
5,"Totally ""Amazed""","I usually don't listen to country music, but Lonestar has me totally amazed. I listened to them live at the Mullet Festival in Niceville, Fl. this past weekend, and couldn't wait to go out and buy this CD. Lonestar leaves nothing to be desired in country music."
5,AMAZED,"this song really makes me realize how much in love i am with my boyfriend, we have been together over 1yr and half. he is so special to me and this song is perfect for me to him. he really does amaze me most of the time we are together."
2,"Baby, I'm NOT amazed","The band can play but I have misgivings.Amazed sounds like the music for Bryan Adams and Robert 'Mutt' Lange's Please Forgive Me. I also thought of Paul McCartney's Baby, I'm Amazed. The lyrics come from another Adams and Lange song, (Everything I Do) I Do It for You."
5,Amazed,"When I first heard Amazed, it was on a soft rock, contemporary station. I didn't know who sang it. When I found out it was a country/western group that sang this song, I was totally ""amazed""! I bought the CD and haven't been disappointed with it. ""Amazed"" and ""I've Got to Find You"" are my favorites. Totally a winner in my book!"
5,Absolutely Amazed,"This is one of the best albums I have ever purchased. Obviously, ""Amazed"" is what first prompted me to buy it; but as I listened further I was extremely happy with my decision. ""What About Now"" is one of those songs that make you want to hop in the car with the roof down and just cruise to your heart's content. As far as my favorite song, it's really a toss up between ""Amazed"", ""I've Gotta Find You"", and ""Smile"". Anyone who has ever been in a serious relationship that came to a bittersweet end could not possibly listen to ""Smile"" and not at least get misty eyed. If you are considering this album and are a COUNTRY MUSIC fan, I am almost positive you'll be very satisfied."
1,Amazed....and disappointed!,"I bought this CD because of the song ""Amazed"", like a lot of other people. Imagine my surprise when I heard the version of Amazed! It's nothing like the song being played over & over again, both on country & pop stations. It's nothing like the version used on their video. Amazed is right. Maybe when I get over my disappointment I'll take the time to listen to the rest of the CD. But there should be a disclaimer on the package warning potential buyers that they're not getting what they're paying for!"
1,Horrible,"I usually use a different kind of tidy cats litterTidy Cats Scoop 24/7 Performance Long Lasting Odor Control for Multiple Cats Cat Litterbut when I was at petco they mislabeledPurina Tidy Cats 24/7 Performance Litter, 10-pounds (Pack of 4)for a price of 2 for $5. They only had 5 left so I bought all 5 for $12.50 and was so stoked by my purchase. I thought that the two litters would be pretty much the same just different packaging. Boy was I wrong.The litter I used to have had very small and fine litter but the new litter was chunkier like a bunch of small rocks. After the first day my cat used the litter and it really bad. I scooped up the poop and threw it up right away. I have two cats and by the next few day I never noticed any pee clumps, all I was scooping was poop. Shortly after, the smell of pee was atrocious. This litter does not CLUMP! Such a disappointment."
3,the worst of the bands career is ok.,"This is a rather limp cd of the band who often forced to record songs it didn't want. That was a ugly fact of the idiotic record companies back then. Here play some soul boys. ALthough the standells made great soul songs too.they were a garage protopunk band in their hearts and this one was just a huge mistake. They made them record other bands hits. Only a dork of a executive could have ordered this one. Still it's all decent versions of other bands materials. But it's for standells fans only , who can enjoy these average versons of other bands hits. NOn completists forget this one and go to 'try it' or 'dirty water' etc. The sound is good and the extra tracks are ok. But still noone put the 'peppermint beatle' on any cd yet. oh well. Or that rarities album either."
4,Irresistable rhythms that drive the core of your being,"I've followed this exciting band for years and they just get better and better. ""No Matter What"" shows Entrain's wide range of musical emotion - from mellow ballads to the fascinating, compelling, intertwined percussion that is their trademark. It is not humanly possible to hear this band without dancing. They define fun."
5,Best Book Ever,Urchin of the Riding Stars is my favorite book ever. It has a lot of aventure and action. Like when Captin Husk got arrested and had a war.
1,Pretty exciting if your 10 years old,"Vicious and brutal have been brought up in reviews here to describe this cd. WHAT? What cd are you people listening to? The only thing brutal about this music is how bad it sounds and how lame the lyrics are. The music, a boring retread of Kiss and Aerosmith cliches, isn't much better than the lyrics. But if you're 10 years old, the idea of scrawny posers wearing makeup and trying to look tough may be appealing."
5,Great Condition,"Book came in on time. Arrived in great condition for a used book. It is practically new. Awesome price, perfect for my college class."
4,Kingsmen - 'The Kingsmen On Campus' (Sundazed),"First put out in 1965, as 'On Campus' appears to be the frat rocker's third actual album. This CD reissue tags on three bonus tracks. Tunes that keep this disc in my current rotation stack for awhile are ""Annie Fanny"", their Beatle's cover ""Hard Day's Night"", Ben E. King's ""Stand By Me"", the uplifting ""Sticks And Stones"", ""Shotgun"" and ""Get Out Of My Life Woman"". Didn't realize they had SO many compilations available."
1,Carville is overrated on this one...,"I dunno... I generally like James Carville's zippy comebacks and I find him to be very fast on his feet, particularly when it comes to trading barbs on talk TV. 'That said, I found little in this book to be new ground - and that's what I've come to expect from Carville. To be candid I believe he squandered the opportunity to write a fact-filled and humorous book on a highly-charged subject. He has the talent but it doesn't show this time. I've given him A-'s before, but this one is a C+ at best. Sorry Cueball."
4,Analysis of a witch-hunt.,"Maybe Carville hits a good ol'boy tone and uses hyperbole a little too often, but it hardly detracts from this simple, brutal diatribe against the Starr Investigation. Carville goes beyond accusations of partisanship and pinpoints the players who are attempting to bring down a president. This book is imformative and often very funny, and also very frightening. Everyone should read this book as a counterpoint to the reports in the mainstream media, especially anyone angry at Clinton or tired of hearing about the investigation. The similarities between this investigation and McCarthyism are all too apparent."
5,GNR Greatest Hits ROCKS!,"This is one of the best greatest hits albums of all time.It has 11 really great songs, the best song is November Rain because it is one of the best hard rock epics I have ever heard.Paradise City is another great song, ROCKS! one of my favorites.Civil War, really great song, my second favorite. Oviously, Sympathy for the Devil could have been deleted and better choicecould have been Mr. Brownstone from AFD. My least favorite outof this could be Patience, too slow. Why can't that be a harderrock song? Another great song is You Could Be Mine, really greatsong. Sweet Child O' Mine, great ballad!!! This has got to bea million stars, and one every rock fan needs to own besidesForty Licks which are better together. GUNS N' ROSES ROCK!!!!!!"
1,bad horrible,missing to many songsmr.brownstoneout ta get memy micheleattitudeone in a millionso fineestrangedgarden of eden14 yearscomaused to love herall these were hits i hear alot of them especialy my michele and used to love her on the radio all the time
1,Not So Good,"Ok where do i start with the very crappy album, well first off this group is not that good, I mean Axel Rose is the worst frontman of all time, hes just some raciest who can scream a lot. I do like some of the guitar work but you can bearlly hear it with Axel singingNow about the lyrics of these songs. I mean these songs have nothing going for them. I mean just listen to Welcome to the Jungle. The only songs that have good lyrics are the songs that this band coverd (and falled to do a good job with)Also this group comes from what is the worst decade of music i can remeber which is the 80's (there was some good music but not much).So if you want to get a good cdi would recomend something by The Beatles or Radiohead or even The Clash but not this band"
5,Guns N Roses ROCK!!!,"This is actually the second time I bought this CD. The first one was loaned to a friend and she conveniently ""lost"" it she loved it so much. I have always liked Guns N Roses and my kids LOVE it. Plus, we are sentimental fans of ""Welcome to the Jungle"" since we lived in Cincinnati for a long time and it was the theme song for the Cincinnati Bengals as the games were starting. (I wish it would translate to them in their playing. Lol!) However, we LOVE this compilation of their greatest hist SO MUCH, that it was worth it to me to purchase it again. Thanks!!!"
3,SO MANY GEMS ARE MISSING!!!!,"this GREATEST HITS compilation got a lot of great cool rock songs, for sure...but SO MANY GEMS are missing!!!!GUNS got only 4 albuns, and i trully think that buying APPETITTE FOR DESTRUCTION, GUNS debut, is WAY better than this compilation...The 2 USE YOUR ILUSION too...Both got only great rockers!!!GUNS was a gifted band until AXL's EGO destroys everything...DO yourself a music favour and buy APPETITE FOR DESTRUCTION and both USE YOUR ILUSION..."
3,Not Worth for a Best of...,"One of the best 80's rock bands was GNR and mostly likely agruable having one of the best albums in ""appetite for destruction"". However, this greatest hits is average in missing at least 4 or 5 great songs that should have been on it. Where is night train, rocket queen, get in the ring, pretty tied up, etc? I was disappointed when I saw the track lisiting as well you should before buying. If you are a fan then you already know the GNR has just 4 worthy albums that should be in your collection and personaly I would have NOT bothered with this one unless having the stones cover of ""sympathy for the devil"" was that important (also on Interview with a Vampire soundtrack) Bottom line buy appetite, lies, use your illusions 1 & 2. GNR rocks!"
5,Great collection,"This is one of the best albums I own. It is a collection of the LA hard rock act's biggest and best hits. Included are all my favorites: 'Civil War', 'Dont Cry', 'Yesterdays', and 'Paradise City'. Not one song should have been missing. I would reccomend getting all of this band's albums, but this is one heckuva start."
5,Paradise City,The 90's are just rushing back. What a great Greatest Hits album from a great band. I think I might just have to take a trip down to paradise city.
2,Only 14 songs?,"It is incredible...the album contains only 14 songs...it seems that we are talking about a band that did not produce anything good...Honestly, the selection is not the best...as a matter of fact, a lot of good songs are missing...Too much waiting for such a poor album..."
4,A great compilation from one of the most popular bands back then and NOW...,"I'm listening to ""Sweet Child O'Mine"" as I'm typing this. Still a great song 20 years after its release! Anyway, if you don't have all the albums from this band (personally, I have Appetite For Destruction and Live Era '87-'93), then the Greatest Hits compilation should suffice. Don't want to go into what's been covered by previous reviewers, but the 14 tracks on this compilation are classic GNR. All of them have stood the test of time thus far and will continue to stand the test of time! Now if only Axl Rose would get around to releasing Chinese Democracy..."
3,Buy This Album and.......,If you want the best of Guns N Roses then buy this album and Live Era 87-93. If you want the best of the best then also get AFD! I'm not saying use you illousion 1 and 2 are not good becaue there great. GUNS N ROSES FOR LIFE!GNR IS AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE BEST BAND EVER!!!
4,A good collection for the average listener,"Axl Rose protested this release, and I can't blame him. Five covers and no Estranged, Nightrain, Rocket Queen or Mr. Brownstone!! However, I do understand that this collection is not a ""Best of"", but a ""Greatest hits""-CD and features all their most popular singles. 7 out of 14 songs can be categorized as ""ballads"" or ""power ballads"", and few of the songs shows what kind of band Guns N' Roses really were. But, of course, it's a great CD with one of the greatest bands of all time!"
4,It's GnR - enough said,"I loved GnR since I heard them for the first time. The distinctive original voice of Axl, Slash's riff's, great song writting. This CD has nothing new which is why only four stars. But all the songs are great. Too bad they didn't have anything new to add. Or at least other versions of the songs (which I can't believe I said, since I hate re-mixes!) But if you have all their other albums, why buy this? I mean, I have them all, including the ""Sympathy for the Devil"" remake that they are using to sell this thing. Aside from the fact that I've been almost desperate for anything Guns... I even had to get the ""End of Days"" soundtrack since it had the 'new' GnR song on it. Waiting for ""Chinese Democracy"" is killing me. But I'll buy it even if I'm an 80 year old lady. Until then, I guess this will have to do. If you're new to Guns, sure start with this. But don't cheat yourself. Buy ""Appetite"" and the ""Illusions"" and ""Lies"" if you can get a copy. They are worth the money hands down."
3,What we've got here is failure to communicate.....,"The above quote was in the song Civil War included in this album, taken from the movie Cool Hand Luke. It perfectly describes the album. This is Greatest Hits, not a Best Of. It was really a last ditch effort to get a GNR album out with the delays of Chinese Democracy. This is half a great album. Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child O Mine, Knockin On Heaven's Door, Civil War, You Could Be Mine, Since I Don't Have You, and Sympathy for the Devil are the only real great songs on this mediocre album. 5 of the songs are covers, 4 songs are ballads, and only 4 of the songs really show the GNR motto of Sex, Drugs, and Rock N Roll. Half GNR, half something else."
4,A FREAKIN' QUARTER!!!!,"For whatever reason, Amazon is selling this baby for 25 cents. Even if you already own the vinyl or cd's of the actual albums, etc. etc, it's definitely worth the ""investment"" onto your cloud storage."
4,its cool,"guns nd roses is a cool band. songs like sweet child of mine are great. i dont like the real heavy stuff like welcome 2 da jungle and such. but, this is broght doewn beucase of the bad songs like knocking on heavens door and simpathy 4 the devil, which are by old fart rockers. there ballads are good and some mid tempoed god"
2,Gn'R,"The only reason I write this review is because the only existing review bothered me so much that I needed to add to it. I agree that a greatest hits, with no new tracks is unecessary, however at least the tracks are remastered. For the reviewer I dont agree that fans should save their money for Chinese Democracy because I think the greatest hits will be a better buy and have more depth to it. Between Axl's ""My World"", ""Oh My god"", and wrecthed live performances I feel he has disgraced the name of the greatest rock band of all time and his album will be simply mediocre considering the amount of time it has taken to create. It seems slightly insecure on his behalf to hide behind the legacy of a name rather than disgrace his own name by putting it on his product. Wake up.I give it two stars because at least someone took the time to run it through some modern day compressors to bring up the level. Not to take anything away from George Marino..."
2,not so happy,This microphone stand arrived with one leg assembled upside down (which made it stand at a 45 degree angle) and the boom adjustments will not hold in place.
2,Get what you pay for,I bought this mic stand as my introductory stand for audio calibrations. It was a bad choice for me. The way the legs support that stand seem to work for a fixed position but I will need to move it around regularly and it does not work well for that. Other adjustments work fine. Will most likely buy another stand and sell this at some point.
2,Not as advertised!,"This description of this item indicates it is ""by Nikon"". It is sold as being a Nikon produced product. It might fit a Nikon lens but it is a cheaper made knockoff by a company called Ye. Sounds like false advertising if you ask me."
5,A Real Cookbook on How to be Jewish!,"If there is an aspect of Jewish life, in the household or out, that you would like to know about, this book has it.It is clear that this was a labor of love, and Ms. Greenburg clearly tackled her task with love, good humour, and an accurate eye for details that would have escaped many writers.The text is interesting, well-written, flows well, gives you what you want to know or need to know, whether your are new to Judaism, coming back to your Jewish roots, a practicing Jew who wants to know more about living a more ""kosher"" life, or just for the gentile who wants to know all about Judaism.It is humourous where it's appropriate, serious where it's not, but the one thing it never is is boring. A most informative, enlightening and entertaining book. I can only say thanks, Blu, for writing such a great book."
5,Buy This Album!,"I work for radio station KSNI FM in Santa Maria, California as the music reviewer. I just happened to find Shalee's album because a listener who won it never picked it up. Was I lucky! This is my favorite album of the year. I just love Shalee's voice. ""Stolen Car"" rocks! I would love to hear more from her...meet her, too! Check out T.J.'s Music Reviews at www.sunnycountry.com."
2,"plastic,from taiwan","The Picture shows a metal radiator.Have a look!! IT say,s what ---$400+++ list. What you get ,is a Valeo{made in Taiwan] ,ONE ROW!! aluminum core,with plastic tanks ,and a handfull of trans cooler line adaptors.that might ,or not ,be right. Omix-ADA,should be ashamed ,to call it a jeep factory part # replacement. You can get the same radiator ,anywhere for $120-$140.locally,and maybe have some recoarse,when it falls apart.did I say ,no warrenty card either."
3,Could this be the worst movie ever made?,"I remember well when this film came out and went to see it with friends on opening night. We all had alot of laughs because it was very hard to believe that all of the talent involved with making this film could turn out such a piece of garbage. It is hard to understand what type of film this is. A adventure? A drama? A musical???. I guess you could say it has quite a bit of it all. So if this was such a a piece of trash why would I buy it and watch it again? I guess you could say sometimes it sparks a interest to see if you would feel the same way 40 years later. I must say it was not as bad as I remembered. Is it a good film? Well no. But it is sort of a camp classic to sit and watch while having a few drinks or a glass of wine. I did enjoy it more than I did 40 years ago, so it may worth a look. But don't forget a glass (or bottle) of wine if you do!!"
3,Lost horizon good movie,The movie was great but quality of disk was not. It had to many bad spots in it and made it a little disturbing to watch. Sound quality was extremely poor in the bad spots.
3,Give a shot when you are working on ion exchangers(resin),I would recommend this book in the starting phase when you want to gather some knowledge about ion exchangers.The material in this book is systematically organised from basic to mid level .Since i am also working on resins so it was my stepping stone and i have to go way beyond it .
4,<Old School Dope>,"Run-DMC were way ahead of their time. Now considered outdated by many, people tend to forget how influential they really were. This is classic Queens style old school dope yo! ""Rockbox"" is slammin' even today. Heavy metal guitar rap has been covered by Ice-T, DOC, Puff Daddy, to name a few. ""It's like that"" is another phat rhyme. ""Hard Times"" gets it done too."
4,Great First Effort,"""Rock Box"" was a perfect mix of rap and rock, done way before some of today's popular groups decided to do it. ""It's Like That"" is one of the earliest rap songs that touched on social issues. Jamaster Jay got to show off his DJ skills on several cuts here, especially on ""Jay's Game""."
5,chainsaw,Great to have since we have so many trees that overhang our back garden and pool. Have also used it for cutting the trees of some of the neighbours. They have been happy not to have had to employ outside help.
1,homelite ranger 16inch 33 cc,"shipped within 4-5 days, somewhat loud compared to past saws and quit working after about 1 tank of gas/oil.3-4 times used then will barely pull for start. I will invest in an Echo saw and not a rebuild next time."
1,Innovative doesn't equal Genius,"You have to give them credit but still you can't judge them on that. Their ryhmes can't compare to the master 2pac or 50 cent. I think everyone who floats it with hip hop knows that these kids blew it by getting involved with Aerosmith. Rock n Roll and drugs were never meant to mix with rap. This music needed to be about bling, [...] and guns while rock needed to be about drugs, cars and [...]. Praise them if you want but tell me you would'nt rather listen to Public Enemy or Starsailor."
1,I only like one cut on this cd.,Where can I get the single Walk This Way? With Run DMC And Aerosmith
3,Not what I thought,"This is called a ""component"" system which leads me to believe it has jacks for adding additional components. It doesn't. The only way to interface with this system externally is via Bluetooth. This is a standalone system. Aesthetically, its a good looking system and the sound is good for a micro system."
1,painful to listen to even now,"I love Motley Crue for what they started with and what they later became. I honestly don't know how this disc was ever really noticed. The songs are simplistic, the musicianship is thoroughly non-impressive and the production sounds poppy and dated even then. Out of the now 15 songs on this disc, only three are tolerable leaving 80% of the songs as pure filler. I find it nearly impossible to believe that this disc ever won a following when other bands like Iron Maiden, Judas Priest were releasing metal epics. Theatre of Pain was a profound disappointment. This cd, for me, really spelled the end for metal as it was known. If this cd was my first exposure to the Crue, then I'm sure that I would never have followed them. It's painful to listen to even now."
3,"pretty good, a little bad...","i don't think this album is up to par with all the other motley albums. it's bluesy and a little toned down. it's raw, but not as raw as shout and too fast for love. it has some great songs (home sweet home, smokin in the boys room) but the rest are o.k. city boy blues is a good tune, so is louder than hell and raise your hands to rock but the rest are forgettable. i hate their image in this album, they were never meant to go glam, they should have stayed leather but they scored their biggest hit with this album so maybe it was a good move. if your curios about motley buy dr. feelgood. if your a fan then buy this one. i can see how many people could love this album, just not me."
5,CITY BOY BLUES,"to tell you how strong this album is,HOME SWEET HOME is my least favorite song on here. like another reviewer said this is more of a blues influenced release than the punkish TOO FAST FOR LOVE."
3,Overall a good CD by the Crue,"This may not be the most popular cd from Motley, but it is a good listen. If you do not have in cd's by the Crue, start off with Too Fast for Love-Shout at the Devil and then Dr. Feelgood. After those three, then Theatre should be heard.Rock on."
4,"""Taken"" and ""Played""",I love Barbara Freethy's books. I have read at least 10 of them and all are good. I have even gotten a friend at work now reading them. I highly recommend them because they keep you interested way till the end and you don't want to put them down till they are finished.
3,Romance was good...,Not as good as the first book but I liked the romance aspect between J.T. and Christina. We finally get closure from the first book.
3,Everybody wants the diamond...,"Christina Alberti, antique jewelry expert working in an auction house, is plagued by association to her criminal father, a jewel thief. If anything goes wrong with the upcoming auction of a large diamond owned by a famous Italian family, she'll be blamed. She ignores the warning given by FBI agent J.T. McIntyre, who believes the diamond is the target of his nemesis, Evan Chadwick. The diamond is stolen and the search ends in Florence, Italy, where more is discovered about the diamond than Christina could ever guess.There's plenty of plot to the story and action, but there were also spans of downtime as the romance developed. Though a little bit disjointed in feel and repetitious to a fault, I still enjoyed the book."
5,Quite excellent,"Quite excellent. Written in a conversational and relaxed tone, the book was a real surprise. I've read it twice already. I highly recommend it without reservation."
2,Regreted Reading,"I had to read this book for 9th grade summer reading. It was the one book that everyone in the Freshman class agrees was horrible. It was pointless and boring. I enjoy a book that reaches you in the heart and Annie John comes no where close. With a little class discussion, we were able to find some meaning to the book but mostly reasons as to why we didn't enjoy reading. Nevertheless, this book has been taken off of the curriculum for summer reading at my school for 9th graders. Wish they would have done it a year ago!"
3,Annie John,"This was one of the strangest books I have ever read. The girl Annie is the most complex person I have ever encountered while reading a book. This book describes the feelings and emotions of a young girl as she is growing up and is going through ""younglady"" trip to adulthood. Its pretty intreasting, although I'm not very sure of the ultimate meaning, but give it a try you won't be sorry."
5,Life To Be,Jamaica Kincaid portrays a dynamic relationship between a mother and a daughter in the novel Annie John. Kincaid travels through the childhood and adolescent years of Annie. From bathing and dressing like her mother to the sudden change that causes Annie to rebel and grow a hatred for the same women she once loved so dearly. This meaningful book will force you to travel back through your own childhood days as well as memories. After completing Annie John you will see why Kincaid was selected as one of three finalists for the 1985 international Ritz Paris Hemmingway award (Voices From The Gaps 2). Jamaica Kincaid uses this powerful novel to portray her own childhood in Antigua. You can clearly see Annie is an autobiographical fiction character living the life very similiar to the one Kincaid once lived.
3,GO THROUGH PHASES,THIS BOOK WAS VERY INTERESTING IT WAS FOOL OF LAFTER YOU SHOULD READ IT I DID MY SELF...
2,only shows weight,"it was a good price and the weight works fine; but the other features as in body fat and body water, don't; it shows ""error"" message. I would have send it back; but it's not worth the hassle and compared to other scales it's okay, I guess"
1,"Every time you weigh, it's a different answer","I joined WW and met my goal, so intended to buy this scale to keep my eye on my weight gain/loss. It's easy to use, no doubt, but every time I step on the scale, I get a different reading. One time it will say 150 lbs, then one minute later, it will drop down to 135 lbs.Now I don't trust it. For me, it was a total waste of money."
4,so far so good,"I just bought this scale yesterday. To test it I weighed myself morning, noon and night. Each time I tried 3-4 readings in a row. They were all consistent.The only downfall I have found so far is no where on the box did it say how high the body fat reading would go. I am 32 years old, 5 foot 6 inches, 240 pounds, with a body fat on other scales of about 43%. This scale errors out every time."
2,all features don't work,"My weight registers consistently, but the body fat and hydration don't show at all, just ""ERR"". (My punny friend said that if I was hydrated enough, it would read ""water"" instead of ""err"" (air). LOL!) Anyway, I bought this scale for those features, ESPECIALLY the hydration feature, so this scale is mostly useless to me. It's also a pain to have to turn it on before stepping on as well. Most other scales I've owned have turned on upon feeling my weight.The manual says nothing about how to correct an ERR message, outside of saying that it will ERR if my weight exceeds the scale's capacity. Um, excuse me? I'm FAR from it!I'd say it's not worth it, since all features obviously don't work."
2,Not what I imagined....,"I thought it was larger and tougher. My 2 1/2 year old son plays with it and the parts fall apart. May glue it together, would not recommend."
1,programmingglitch,"If you want to do some professional programming this book is almost a waste. It is very basic. VERY BASIC. Doesnt answer any of the basic questions. Okay. With MFC and SDI and MDI and all the supposedly cool and hyper smart stuff we at least hope to go beyond writing codes in SDI and MDI for saying ""Hello World"", and typing three stings as a document file. If that is supposed to be smartness....god save the world. No Help. With anything. Wont help you write a windows application. Unless ofcourse, you are the hello world kid. And get an ego boost once your hello world works!"
5,A Superb Tutorial!,"Simply put, this is the best tutorial for programming that I've read, and I have read quite a few. The code examples are mixed with just the right amount of text and figures to give the reader a clear understanding of how MFC/C++ works under the hood. I will be on the lookout for other books written by this author."
4,turtle surf tunes,"This is the earliest songs from the turtles when they were the surf group the crossfires. It has some great songs on it like 'one potatoe, two potatoe"" ( a california hit regional single) , and 'silver bullet' and some average tracks too. The sound quality varies on these tracks but overall they are worth owning. In fact the whole turtles catalog is worth owning. The boys were just beginning at this point and they would explode into action in 1965 with their first turtles album. This one was of course a complilation of early preturtles tracks, and you do get excellent guitar playing, and a few harmonies but not like what was to follow. If you aren't a fan of sixties surf music then you won't like this one but that type of music is pretty fun actually. This one though is for turtles fans who should grab it."
