3,no battery,"i got this product without a battery. such a disappointment for my son ,why do u people de fraud us to buy yall crap"
4,Power Wheels,Excellent toy was a 2nd Birthday present it took about 15 minutes for him to learn how to operate the controls then it was off to the races.It needs some skill to assemble properly but not too much and it seems sturdy enough. Battery lasts about an hour I am thinking of buying a second one because he always wants to use it longer and it takes 14 hours to recharge. Overall the F-150 Power Wheels exactly as I expected.
5,julie and girlfriend are good movies.,julie starring neha dhupia as a high priced call girl who falls in love with a millionaire business man to escape her shamefull past is a lovely film about love and finding the right person to fall in love with and overcoming the harsh realities and difficulties in life.Girl friend starring ishaa koppikar and amrita arora as lesbian lovers who break apart because amrita arora falls in love with a man is a lesbian romance that turns nasty when it becomes a love triangle about one lesbian trying to fight to keep her lesbian lover girlfriend.The story would have been better if it was about two beautifull girls in love with the same guy and they were both straight.
4,Meditations on Confessing Real Existence,"This work aims at preparing the reader to enter into the ""office of confession,"" and probes deeply into the inner motivations for choosing to become an authentic self. Considered a classic of devotional literature, it sometimes reads obscurely (e.g., the ""Good"" is never really defined), yet at other times is radiantly clear (e.g., on the call to live self-consciously and with responsibility). As with all of SK's non-psuedonymous works, ""Purity of Heart"" makes for worthy reading which will provoke and challenge you."
2,"Amazing Book, Horrible Version","I'm giving this book two stars not because of the content of the book but because there are typos on almost every page!!! Was the editor blind or something? Sren Kiekergaard is my favorite philosopher and what he has to say in this book is incredible, but do not waste your time buying this version of Purity of Heart is to Will One Thing. This one is chock-full of errors."
3,good item but,this is a great headphone amp except it isnt exactly wortrh the price and it only sounds perfect with the headphones it comes with
1,"Please..., Let it go","Absolutely pathetic. I held out hope right up through the last four pages, thinking somehow there would be something there at the end to make up for such a tortuous read. Here's the deal - there is nothing here to care about - the writing (especially the dialogue), characters, and story all come in under the column-heading TRITE. The comparisons with Margaret Atwood are unfounded. Save yourself - this is a dud. And, a wet one at that."
1,ZZZZZZZ,"Boring, boring boring!! Read 'Brave New World' instead. Brave New World is better written and much more interesting."
2,Disappointed,"this was the selection of my book club...I looked forward to reading it because I had enjoyed The Remains of the Day but I did not care for this book; just ""not my cup of tea..."" however, several other members liked it a lot while some others agreed with me ...its all personal opinion."
5,Great quality !!,I received this really quick an it's in great shape. It's also a fantastic read!! BONUS!!!
2,Missed opportunity,"I bought this book because a friend was reading it and recommended it based on the first third he had read so far. When he finished he said it was ""kinda anti-climatic"", which I have to agree with, and not only because you could tell how the book was going to play out almost from the beginning, but because the characters hardly develop at all. Really, given what was happening to them, I'd have thought that realistic characters would have reacted pretty differently. Also, the universe itself wasn't self-consistent. I'm not sure how to explain that comment without giving away ploy, so I won't.At the same time, it was an entertaining, quick and easy read because it's written in a conversational, first person, dialog-driven style. I was always eager to pick it up and continue, so I'm not willing to say that it's not worth reading at all. And yet it was disappointing, because it felt like a missed opportunity to better explore the reality and characters."
4,Always Excellent,"Ishiguro is an amazing writer. Many people fell in love with 'The Remains of the Day' which is a literary triumph. Never Let Me Go is on par with his other writings. The book is, as all of his works, beautifully written. The tone is somewhat melancholy as it tackles the question of what can one make out of something that is destined to be nothing. I would highly recommend this book."
2,Boring,"This was one of the first books I read on my kindle and I have to say I was hugely dissapointed. The author gives so many unimportant details and just when you think there will be some revelation as to what is going on, the narrator takes 10 steps back to tell you the background of the story. You don't really find out what exactly is going on until the end of the book. It was a struggle to finish the book. The character development and relationships were great and the premise of the story was good too. Bad execution."
3,Okay,"I didn't really love this book. The premise is interesting, but... this may be one of the few cases where I'd just watch the movie. (I haven't actually seen the movie.)"
4,A tone of disappointed sadness,"I did not get this book at the beginning. I could not understand exactly what it was about. The tone of the book disconcerted me. I saw that the description was made in clear but somehow not emotionally powerful language. I could not make out what 'donor' meant and that the book was really about human 'clones'. I thought it was somehow about some kind of retarded mentally people. In any case the dynamic of relationships between narrator Kathy and her friend and later lover Tom , and her rival and later friend Ruth is in some way at the center of the work. A sense however of incompleteness in all the relationships is strongly felt. Perhaps Ishiguro deliberately created the work so that this sense of incompleteness and disappointment would be felt throughout.But I frankly did not get it. And so I was not drawn with feelings of powerful sympathy to the characters as I am in my favorite Literature."
4,"So, Go, already!","Ishiguro's style is impeccable: The the horror seeps and creeps magnificently. Then about two thirds through I started scanning pages. Ok. I get it. These people have real souls, feelings, aspirations; they are real humans. I just don't rave about books that go on 250 pages and then have tell all denouments that come in a burst such as takes place in this book in Chapters 21 and 22. But if you think about it, we, the readers, became the 'students' at the hand of Mr. Ishiguro. We have our own nightmares: Whatever became of all the 'babies'?"
5,Never Let Me Go,"A haunting tale of love within the modern world of DNA cloning. The story revolves around three friends who grow up inside the confines of an Engish ""school"" established for the sole purpose of raising cloned children; who will become vital organ donors.There resides an overwhelming moral issue here! These children are human, and have love and aspirations of children born through normal means. The unresolved question is: Should harvesting organs from children born for this purpose ever be allowed?Read the book or watch the movie, then answer the question.Another hit for Kazuo Ishiguro."
2,Zzzzzzzz.....,"Wow. If you want a book that never EVER comes to a climax, this is the book for you. Honestly one of the most boring books I have ever read. It had a slow start, a slow middle, and right up until the last page...SLOW. I had to finish it because it was my book club read. Ugh. If you want to torture yourself read this book. This book could have been written in about 1/2 the amount of pages used. It does not evoke one amount of emotion in my body. I'm not sure why all the good reviews!?The book is written in the first person, by Kathy and all she does is talk about what she says to another character, how she felt when she said it, before she said it and after she said it. And, then talks about the other character's response, how she THINKS they felt, how they really felt and years later how one thing she said had an effect. Bored yet? That's the ENTIRE book."
1,Never Read This Book,"I had never read this author before, but, because he is much praised, and because I liked the premise (human cloning), I gave it a try. I kept reading, waiting for something significant to happen, or for some interesting philosophical or technical points to be made with respect to cloning, but no--just a tedious recounting of boarding school days and a rather soap operatic story about the relationships among the three main characters. Ishiguro may be a great author, but this book is just simply no good. P.D. James' ""The Children of Men"" is a much better book, if you're looking for a science fiction novel by a mainstream English author--great plot, great characterization, and intellectually stimulating."
3,Eh..,"the premise of the book,the idea and everything was really phenominal. the idea that this could possibly happen either now or in the future, is scary and sad. however, the ramblings of the main character, the stories and stuff, was slightly over detailed for me which made the beginning to middle of the book fall flatter than flat with a bland taste. the only good part about this book is the last 3-4 chapters where everything is explained. only then did the story become sad, and worth reading, the last 30 pages thats about it. i wouldn't recommend this book to people who are easily bored or discouraged."
2,Not for me.,"I bought this book because the premise was an interesting, if not totally original one and I believed it would be an enjoyable and/or thought provoking way to pass the time on a four hour flight. However, I have to admit I was disappointed by the end product. I found the narrator's voice incredibly monotonous, the plot poorly paced and the characters largely unsympathetic. There were one or two nice flourishes but overall not enough to justify a positive review."
3,Really not about cloning....,"This book is a really lovely representation of the type of psychological adaptation that allows people to live through the worst sorts of experiences without losing their dignity.Having said that, I really think that people should give the reviewers who rated this book with 1 star a break: the ""scientific"" details are terrible, and the 4 donations model (which indeed pervades the book) makes very little sense to anyone who knows anything about medicine. Neither does the need for carers, the timing of donation in adulthood or... well, most of the medical details.So, for anyone going to the book because it gives insights about human cloning, understand that it will most likely disappoint. As a narrative that treats questions about the ethics and practices of cloning and transplantation, this book does not do a convincing job. For this book to work, you really have to suspend your critical faculties the same way the narrator does."
2,"Slow, repetitive and boring","This book was a selection of my book group, so a ""must read,"" which, frankly, if not so,would have gone in the ""don't finish"" pile. It was a struggle to finish, with little really interesting happening, constant references to ""if I said this"" ""then that"" or ""if I had only known this"" ""then that"" and on and on ad nauseum. I read ""The Remains of The Day"" and enjoyed it, and very much looked forward to this book--what a disappointment.The plot was veiled but obvious from the beginning--wicked science, out of control, clones--issues which either have been or will be concerning--but packaged in this book--no go. Can't understand either, as other commentators have said, how this particular book was considered for awards.Even my husband the science fiction fan threw up his hands after trying to read this book."
2,A good idea muddled in verbose idiocy,I was so disappointed. I love Ishiguro's earlier work. But this story almost bored me to tears. There's none of the suspense and hunger a reader feels when they pick up The Handmaid's Tale. The narrator Kathy is by far one of the worst story-tellers in existence. All the dialogue reads like it's the same person speaking over and over again. The narrator downright refuses to ever get to the point therefore each section is drug out page after page without the reader learning anything but frustration. Didn't anyone edit Ishiguro? Or do they stop doing that after you win a Booker Prize?
4,Beautiful writing creates haunting moments,"It is the sensitive but matter-of-fact way that Kathy H tells her story, describes her life, that makes it so touching. She accepts her lot, doesn't try to escape it. The universality of her school life made her story resonate more. The passages when she and Tommy learn the truth about how the world views them, how those not at Hailsham were treated, the reason behind all that artwork ... so powerful. My only complaint about the book was the pacing. I wish the story had unfolded faster. (Though it's possible I felt that way because I already saw the movie.)"
1,Sad Story,Twice I started this book (picked it up at the book store because I admire the author) and each time I read 2/3 of the story and had to put it down. Where was the hope?
1,Not recommended,"I enjoy books that do one of two things. They either really entertain me (I'm amused or shocked or fascinated, etc.) or they impart some valuable information or insight. The best books do both. This one did neither.And, as others have mentioned, there are some real problems with the basic premise of the book. The way they go about harvesting the organs seems very inefficient. And why are these people so incredibly passive? There are other questions but probably the biggest one is that we need to imagine that such an ethically repulsive practice could exist in 1990s England. This would have required an alternative history that resulted in a very different England, or world for that matter, and this history would have to be built into the book in some way. But actually, I don't think there's a story here that would have made all that trouble worthwhile."
2,Flat and no Excitement,"The subject is intriguing and the story had potential but the more I read the more restless I became because nothing was happening. The writing style and grammar leaves much to be desired and it goes on and on where you keep wondering when it will get to the point. The characters are deadpan boring and emotionless without spark and sense and it ends the same way. No big climax or finale, just the same crap and then it's done. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I was going to see the movie in the hopes they didn't stick exactly to the story which is often the case, but when I read those reviews I could tell that the movie is exactly like the book."
1,Dull as dirt,"I am a bookworm and am always looking for great new novels. I heard some great things about this book so I picked it up at the library. I'm soooo glad I didn't waste my money! I think it was a really cool concept, but I really had to struggle to finish it. It just drags on and there's never any action or anything the least bit interesting. And if you've read any review about it, you already know basically what's going on anyway. I kept thinking surely there will be some surprise at the end or something really cool will happen. Nope."
5,Gripping,"I got this book for my Kindle on the recommendation of a friend. I loved it and have suggested it as a book for my next book club. I don't like to give away plots, but this book really gets you thinking about the issues of medical research and how far we should or should not go."
4,One more favorable review,"Reviewers are saying much that explains things that would otherwise be somewhat more mysterious on a first reading, but I can report that knowing ahead of time what ""completing"" means and so on seems to me likely to do little in the way of diminishing this novel's hold on readers. I thought that this book did more than play at moral seriousness."
3,Very long..,"This book is well written, but it takes a long, long time until the author gets to the point. It requires patience."
3,Nice writing but fatally flawed premise,"Some reviewers have said the writing is so good that the implausibility of the premise doesn't matter. I disagree. The premise is so preposterous I couldn't suspend my disbelief. After all, the society described is clearly not a brutal totalitarian regime that suppresses dissent, and there is no hint of a weird religion having taken control of the country, so the concept that the victims could somehow be thought of as subhuman doesn't make sense. The idea that the system described would be tolerated, and that the victims would take it so meekly, is not sustainable. In addition, the writing is not up to the level of the author's previous novels. Some of the emotional situations and social games among the main characters become repetitious."
2,Booker Finalist?,"I thought that the simple story of parentless children and their friendships within this institution was touching and the type of thing that Ishiguro writes well, but the story was so unconvincing to me in terms of both the science of cloning and the evil capacity of human nature that I didn't think it was either good science fiction or allegory. In light of this and the page-turning device of unfolding basic information in a much extended, backward sort of way, the novel to me struck only one sustained, tear-jerking note while I waited for the last bits of information to be revealed. It was too removed from reality to be truly important I thought (though many in my book club seemed to heartily believe that harvesting orphan clones organs was certainly in the dark future), and even sappy and self-indulgent in the absence of this real importance. It was a fast enough read that I kept with it to the end, but was left thinking it was quite hack for someone of Ishiguro's reputation."
2,Barely watchable,"I had heard this movie was bad, but I didn't know it was this bad. Ten minutes in they have set up this Blackwater type company that you either know will be the bad guy or is just a big ol' red herring. The best mysteries give you several red herrings, but ""State of Play"" makes it obvious that it will either be one thing or the other and then it just becomes boring. None of the actors are particularly bad in it including the killer who looks like Steve Carrell's cousin, but it meanders. Two stars."
3,good movie.,"it showed that the american justice system is still working and swift. hope that in real life it is so. no grandstanding committee, no nonsense questioning. . ."
2,Shallow repeat of a theme,"I cannot say you waste your money completely if you just want a conventional form of entertainment. The movie isplaying with big themes (corruption, outsourcing of military combat to mercenaries) but at the end of the day has a completely artificial and shallow plot. The twist at the end is basically ridiculous. Russel Crowe is not that great and Ben Affleck is bland and unconvincing."
1,Boring!,"I did see the BBC miniseries before the US movie, but I knew if I went into it expecting John Simm and Phil Glenister, I'd be disappointed, so I went looking for a completely different movie with a completely different story. Of course there's stuff missing, it's HOURS shorter, it had to be condensed, and for the sake of clarity, things had to be moved around. That's not my problem. My beef is how ungodly BORING the movie is. It's SO SLOW and disjointed, that I felt like I was about to fall asleep. If you want a good thriller, sure, try the original State of Play, which is great, but there are lots of other good thrillers out there, too. I'm not saying one State of Play or other is the better version, I'm just saying that this movie is an all around bad movie, regardless."
1,wake me up when the movie is over,"I just watched the movie and 30 minutes into the movie I wanted to turn it of to stop my self from falling asleep. I am from the DC area and this is the only reason why I watched the movie to the end, to see if I recognize some of the places. The story is worn out and the acting is lame. Russel Crove is one of my favorite actors and I am willing to forget that he is the main character in this extremely boring movie and I am sure that he will take part in a good movie again.Kind Regards,Sleepyhead"
4,Crackling Political Thriller,"For the first two-thirds or so I thought this flick was teetering toward predictability. In the last third is when some decent twists and red herrings start to kick in. At this point you find yourself riveted to the screen. The denouement is plausible and definitely not a cop-out. The film is distinguished by top-notch direction, writing, and acting particularly Ben Affleck as a disgraced congressman. I note Affleck becuase lately he's been making his mark not only in this film but in ""Hollywoodland"" where he was stupendous as the late actor George Reeves. ""State of Play"" isn't a particularly great film but better than the average fare."
3,Ok political thriller.,"State of Play is an interesting political thriller but I was kind of left disappointed. The story is somewhat boring and flat - but this film is better than some of the turkeys I have seen this year. The cast is stellar - minus Ben Affleck, he can't act his way out of a paper bag. Russell Crowe, Rachel McAdams, Robin Wright-Penn, and Helen Mirren always bring their A-game. I wish I liked this film better, it's a mixed bag for me."
4,Another enjoyable performance by Crowe,I liked the twists and turns of the storyline. The action moved the story along at a good clip. The performances of all characters where well done. Of course it was enjoyable because the plot was consistent with my view of life that truth and authenticity wins out in the end.
3,SO SO...,So so. Loved the cast. Was disappointed in the story. Russell Crowe is betterthan this movie. Same with the others.
3,Boring,I found this movie to be BORING. But for those of you who love this sort of genre will appreciate the professional acting etc...
5,STEREO REMOTE FOR VEHICLE,THIS ITEM CAME READY TO USE AND WORKS MOST OF THE FUNCTIONS OF THE STEREO. THE BEST THING I LIKE ABOUT THE REMOTE IS THAT I CAN ANSWER AND HANG UP MY PHONE JUST USING THIS REMOTE. IT IS PERFECT IF YOU ARE SICK OF LEANING FORWARD TO CONTROL THE DIAL!!
3,Pretty dim,Had to buy 100 watt replacement energy smart bulbs to get the light desired. These lights don't give off as much light as a regular 60 watt bulb
1,mercury in all compact fluorescent bulbs,To properly clean up after a CF bulb breaks is a nightmare due to their mercury content. I will do everything in my power to avoid using them.
2,Not enough info,"Be aware these are NOT ""Daylight"" bulbs with the light color in the 5100 - 6500K range. Instead, they are the ""Warm White"" type, with the output color at 2700K. This gives a red-yellowish light that, unless you use multiple lamps or a much larger lamp than these, appears very dim, and makes colors look ""off"".This information is not given in the product information, but it definitely should be!"
5,Excellent product and the packaging is great!,"This product is a great one from GE, but who else makes light bulbs in large quantities. Choices are limited in this space because of all the subsidiaries make the same bulb, but sell it at different prices. The back has a seperate opening for each bulb, which is excellent. This is a quality product that is more than marginial. I would recommend this product."
4,CFL Bulbs--These are NOT for Dimmable Fixtures,"These CFL bulbs are great. They don't flicker and they save energy. The only thing I wish I had known was that these bulbs do not work in fixtures with dimmer switches. This is unfortunate, since I searched on Amazon for ""dimmable CFL bulbs"" and was directed to these specific bulbs. There was nothing on the product page or description that said it would not work with dimmable fixtures. When I received the package, I read the fine print (not readable on amazon.com) and saw that I could not use these with dimmable fixtures.Otherwise, the product is great. And these bulbs are brighter than you might expect for 60 watts. I recommend them, just don't expect to use them in a dimmable fixture."
3,"Cheap, not greatest light quality but they work","Did I mention they were cheap? Just under a buck a piece. They seem to fire up rather quickly, and don't seem to need the ""warm up"" time that some CFL bulbs do. 3k-ish light temperature...typical budget bulbs that appear fairly yellowish but (should) last for several years and cut costs over incandescent bulbs."
3,Not happy with dim yellow light.,"These bulbs are not what they claim (60 Watt equivalents). They are far duller and give off a nasty sickly looking yellow light.When I replaced the 2 bulbs in 1 room with these... My Brother asked me if a bulb burnt out. I just laughed. 2 of these bulbs seem to equal 1 75 Watt bulb. So I would need 3-4 to make up for the light I lost.If you want to go green and save a little... Look for a higher watt bulb (some where in the 20's). It will make you happy if you want to replace 1 or 2 bulbs in a room. Other wise, the cave effect isn't very appealing."
1,Too expensive for the short life span,"I replaced almost every bulb in my house with these compact fluorescent bulbs. While they are quite pricey, I thought it would even out in the long run since they were supposed to last so much longer than conventional bulbs and also lower my electric bill. I did notice a slight difference in the electric bill, but these bulbs certainly don't last any longer than the conventional bulbs. In fact, half of them have burned out in less than a year! They weren't on dimmer switches either, just regular light fixtures. I also don't like that they take so long to go to full brightness. I have no window in my bathroom and with these bulbs, it was like having only a night-light on for several minutes until they warmed up. Just did not like them at all."
5,Work Perfectly,"They work as expected and have a decent light intensity and distance. I will note, however, that Sams club has these for 2.90 (ish) so you will pay more buying from Amazon."
3,Wait and See,"We ordered these light bulbs for our new dining fixture in our house. Less than 2 months after installing, we've already had one bulb burn out. I'll have to wait and see how long the rest of the bulbs last or if this is going to be a common occurance. Certainly no where near the hours we should have gotten.Pending ..."
3,Just O.K.,"This product is way to heavy for what its used for. What they could have at least done was make the handle from a lighter material like plastic. I don't think doing that would have affected the effectiveness of this product. As for claiming what it does, I'm slightly impressed. There have been numerous occasions where multiple passings were needed in the same area only to discover, once I pulled the car out of the dimly lit garage, it still hadn't picked up all the dirt. Am I doing it wrong? Am I not applying enough pressure? Don't know but what I do know is that I won't be recommending this product to anyone I know."
3,B&D CrossHair,"This tool is easy to use and adequate for the weekend DIY'er. It only illuminates two laser lines (up and to the right) which can be a limiting feature. Lines, however, were level at short distances (less than 10'). I have no desire to have to use the marking target for greater distances. Lock layout feature is good. Quality of beam is adequate to poor - you have to decide whether to save the line or split it when marking - line fades near end of projection and in places completely dissappears on wall (smooth, previously painted drywall). Marking for pin-up to wall is good b/c it is in line w/both beams. For myself - this gadget is going back where it came from while I look for something else. For the money - you get what you pay for - avoid the stud finder combo."
2,Only works in one direction,This tool shines beams at right angles. When using the self leveling hanger the beam only shines one beam up and one beam to the right. Difficult if you want a beam to the left. Also the self leveling hanger has a sharp pin that is easy to break off and difficult to replace.
1,Good Tidings 4936287 Decorative Seasinal Swag,"I could not be more disappointed with this item. This is the first item that I have been unhappy with that I purchased on Amazon. It was half of the size that it was descrided and looked very crumpled. And to makes matters worse, I forgot to return it during during the holidays. I hope that anyone considering purchasing this item will reconsider after they see this."
1,It hasn't been delivered yet....where is this product...it was a gift?,This product wasn't delivered yet...where is it...it was a gift for my best friend...please explain ASAP
4,Required Reading!,"This book wasn't what I expected from the title -- it was more about Esme educating the school and administrators than about her getting ""broken in."" All the same, I loved her creativity and enthusiasm, and the way she shared her shortcomings as well as her successes made the book even more inspiring.The book was short, concise, easy to read, and fun. It should be required reading for all teachers and parents. Esme Codell is the teacher you wish your kids would have."
2,Smugness at it's best,"As a third year teacher, I am constantly on the look-out for teacher memoirs that can give me some sense of belonging. This book, however, is more of a list of things that ""Madame Esme"" did right in her first year of teaching. It's hollow, incredibly smug, and rings untrue for me. I can't believe that this woman actually DID teach for a whole year ... everything she tries as a teacher seems to have worked, and I believe if you were to ask her, nothing would have gone wrong. Hollow, useless ... although funny at times, I suspect that's more because she's a good writer rather than a good teacher.If you are a student teacher or a first year teacher thinking about buying this book, you're much better off reading bellhooks, who, though she is a college professor, knows more about pedagogy in her little finger than Esme Codell (or ""Cordell"" as her maligned principal refers to her) knows in her whole body.This is not the realistic world of teaching!!!"
5,Nirvana Live,OHH GOD CANT WAIT FOR THIS CONCERTI AHV SEEN FEW CLIPS ON LIVE TONIGHT SOLD OUT..I WILL BE THE FIRST ONE GONA BUY THIS DVD ..
1,"Yes, there are sync issues","I can't believe the gall of the publisher to post something in the Product Description area claiming there are no sync issues.I'm using an up to date Oppo blu-ray player, Samsung plasma TV, and a Pioneer receiver, all of which don't have any issues with other blu-ray discs.All you have to do is watch the 2nd song, Aneurysm, and watch Dave Grohl's drum parts. Something is off, just slightly, but it's off. It's obvious. Do a search...it's all over on other web sites.So disappointing. This should be a monumental release. I would suggest not buying this version."
4,What can one say? Probably their best available performance,"iconic now, right? - part of our lexicon - Kurt had deep waters but they were troubled. Sad that he checked out early. Yeah life is hard and things suck - but nothing beats looking back and remembering all the treasurable moments as your kids grew up before your eyes. Sorry you missed out on that Kurt."
2,Two way radio? really???,"To me I own this product for almost 10 years, I have to say the the radio isn't two way, it was however a scanner. Although nowadays i can listen to the police radio but that's not the point. The thing is, If you wanted to have your own channel privately, you have to change a lot of channels, and that is a waste of time. while I can get another one for a cheaper price. so for this, I have to rethink of selling it or keeping it."
3,"Eh, whatever....","I was disappointed in ths book. Ruckman's critical, accusatory,name-calling style didn't do much to enrich me theologically. He made some wonderful points and offers a great explanation of the flaws of Calvinistic 'doctrine.' However,these could easily be overshadowed by the lack of tact he exhibits while making those points. Speaking passionately and frankly doesn't necessitate speaking boorishly and condescendingly. If you can see past the arrogance, Ruckman gives a good biblical rebuttal to TULIPers....But you have to look very closely...."
3,vivitair does not honor its waranty!!,"I bought this camera, It lasted about 4 months, screen is seems smaller than said. Soon after the top buttom to take the picture just fell in. This camera has never been dropped, and only adults have used it. So I mailed it to vivitar...They mailed it back---with a post-it note saying its fine!!! WOW, its fine IF you stick a pen or stick object in the top, to take the picture!!!!!! sheeesh. My finger wont fit. I wonder how they like taking pictures?!! IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW TO CONTACT VIVITAR VIA PHONE THOUGH NON-LONGDISTANCE...LET ME KNOW. I would pass on this. Its an ok camera for beginers. But mine, did NOT last. AND they did NOT honor my waranty. (which is still good!!) I wasted 10 bucks to ship it to them too, safely!!"
3,Makes some assumptions on facilities,"This cookbook had some limited use for me. It was a short introduction on tips for RV cooking. Overall some good general tips, but nothing that probably isn't in a good trade magazine. As an experienced camping and backpacking cook I was hoping for information on RV cooking now that I have a refrigerator. It does give some good recipes that utilize the better facilities of an RV. However about half the recipes assume you have an oven as well. My small Class B RV doesn't have an oven. Therefore, half the book is useless for me. Overall a slightly disappointing book that I wish I had looked over before purchasing."
2,Sort of Useless,Anyone with a stove and the right ingredients can cook whatever they would at home. I bought it thinking it would offer something different and smart. Not really.
1,Can't start this green machine,"I just spent the last 3-4 hours trying to start my new Lawn Boy out of the box...Still not started. The blade was hitting the side of the mower and would not turn. Now it just spins with nothing happening. I read the manuals over and over to no avail. The web site says "" pull the string then if it doesn't start call for service"". I called the help line and they said take it to a local dealer ? This was an expensive lawnmower for me to purchase and it has been all day and my grass is not cut with now idea when I will get it back. The dealer near my house is only 5 miles away but he has about 500 mowers to be serviced in front of mine. Needless to say this whole purchase has been a big mistake. Buying my next large item in a store not online. Also the UPS driver needed me to help him carry it into my yard and it looked like someone had dropped the box several times but not enough to refuse delivery."
5,The Missing Parenting Manual,Every parent should be issued a copy of this at the hospital after the birth of their child. Just a lot of good sense boiled down to six easy rules.I make it a habit to give this as a baby gift to all my friends.
4,More like Fallout Add-on Pack,"Don't get me wrong, I love Fallout 1 and 2, but Fallout 2 seems more like a expansion pack than a sequel. The game play is the same, no new skills, and only one new trait. There are new items and perks, though. The first mission is the same as Fallout. You have to get a G.E.C.K. (Garden of Eden Kit) to save your Village, instead of getting a waterchip to save your vault. You can also get married, but to only 2 people. If you liked the first game, get this one. But if you didn't, don't bother."
2,Boring book,"There are a few good observations and suggestions in the book. But it was deceptive to me: too wordy; devoid of a logic sequence, therefore confusing; and, above all, incredibly repetitious. I think the handwritten style are just a way to disguise this lack of content. Twenty pages with the main points and suggestions clearly organized would turn it a much better work!"
1,don't waste your time,"I bought this book at a time when I really needed help desparately. I found it to be a lot of self babble that brought up your ""issues"" or problems, but never got in to how to make things better or how to fix them. The ""handwritten"" print style is very distracting when you are trying to read about something so emotional. I find myself wishing I had not wasted the [amt]for it and am still looking for another book to help me through my troubled times. VERY DISAPPOINTING!!!"
3,Not tough enough,It cleans some. But is not up to getting a DVD working again.I would not purchase it again. Spend a few dollars more and get one with abresavives
1,Not Very Reliable,"I have owned this gun (FinishPro 35) for about 8 months. I am a professional Carpenter and use it on a daily basis. The nail-depth adjustment has fallen apart 3 times which causes the saftey-element assembley to fall out, rendering the gun useless. It is not very reliable. The foam rubber grip wore off after the first two weeks of using it. If you are looking for quality and durability, then look elsewhere. I will also mention that nails for this gun seem to be about 20-30% higher than nails for other guns in the same class as this one. Knowing what I know now about this product, I would not purchase another. I can't comment on the stapler that is included in this package since I do not own it."
5,Great Book for Independent learners too,"There is a reason that Wheelock's Latin is used over and over again in classrooms: He know his stuff. I've never taken a Latin course, but I like to study languages independently when I have free time, and I've wanted to learn Latin for awhile. This book is a very good book for me, and I can follow it quite well."
3,Buy _Learn to Read Latin_ Instead!,"This is a decent textbook...However, it is rather dated, and LaFleur's additions aren't very helpful. The 3rd edition (used) of this book is by far the best...Instead of going all the way through this book and still not being able to READ actual Latin, buy the textbook _Learn to Read Latin_ by Andrew Keller and Stephanie Russel. No synthetic Latin passages to read, and quite a large variety of readings (Propertius, Ennius, Vergil, Quintillian etc...) The best of Moreland and Fleischer and Wheelock combined, minus the flaws of both. And the workbook exercises are checked against the PHI cd-rom for syntax and correlation with actual usage in the Latin text corpus.Add in a PDF answer key from the authors, and you are good to go.No, I'm not affiliated with the authors, I am a former UMass Amherst student who just got frustrated with inferior textbooks (Athenaze, OLC/CLC, etc!)"
4,Latin for Beginners,Wheelock's Latin is an excellent text for first year college students. It is best used with the study guide offered with the text. Each chapter is very readable and includes literature and history to enhance the student's experience.
3,Wheelock's Latin,"It is ok, but it is not a super user friendly book to learn out of. If you are looking for something more user friendly try a beginner's latin book."
5,Love Affair,"On repeat on my CD player. Such talent, such beautiful compositions.Music to ""chill out"" to. Music to make love to. Music to drive to.Calming."
4,"""Come Away With Me"" for Nico lovers and hung-over hipsters","It's ""Come Away With Me"" for Nico lovers and hung-over hipsters. This Israeli/Parisian woman shifts back and forth between French and English, holding it all together with her fragile eggshell vocals, woozy, Sunday-morning instrumentation and unvarnished, acoustic production. The title track ends with a three-minute fade-out of breathy white noise stitched together by violins and a solitary horn blowing a sparse, three-note mantra. Nolita is beautiful."
3,Was OK,I personally did not like the taste but some of my friends mixed it with strawberries or banana and was a little better
1,Blech.,"Honestly, I drank one shake of this and... almost finished it. I thought it tasted terrible. Grainy, chalky, artificial, blech. After having tried the Body by Vi shake, which is delicious, and hoping for one with less allergens and the hope of getting same benefit for less $$$ with this one, I must say: huge disappointment. It's headed to the dumpster."
2,Boring............,"I loved the concept and bright colors of this toy. I thought it would be educational. My 4 year old played it twice, told me how it works and wandered off in pursuit of more interesting toys."
4,"Very cool concept, but needs more pieces","Both my 2 and 5 year old have enjoyed playing with the Balancing Cactus (I love all of Plan Toys' products--great design paired with eco-mindedness). It's simple, very fast, and easy to clean up, so it's a perfect game for young attentions spans. However, it needs more pieces in order to present an actual balancing challenge to most players--much of the time, my kids have added all the cactus ""lobes"" and it still hasn't tipped over. If Plan Toys would add about 10 more lobes to the game, it'd be perfect."
2,An okay book to have,"I really didn't care much for this book. I guess it would've been a good tool to have if I was looking to plan activities with children that were ""simple"" theme related such as spring. I found a few activities mention in the book to not be age developmental appropriate."
4,Enticing,"The sensuous description of chili drove me, in desperation, to a big bowl of red. If you don't know what that is, you'll find out in this book.The recipe for Peanutty Pepper Cake and the mail-order sources in the afterword are worth the purchase price. And the plot's good, too."
2,"Not a total loss, I give it two stars.","Not only is this book a nearly identically paraphrase of vendor documentation, the pages can fall out if you bend the covers to a readable position! I am really disappointed. I expect more from the technical books I buy, and this book comes up short in its ability to explain VMware. Though it is not a total loss, I give it two stars."
5,Wonderful Gift,"This is such a nice book and wonderful gift. I really liked reading bumper stickers when I was in Israel, but I could never find a place to get them. This book has pictures of hundreds of them, translates them, and pairs them in humorous ways. It is also a great way to learn about politics in Israel."
3,"All These Years is short, yet pleasing.","I found this book was entertaining, however it was very short. I enjoyed the photos, as all Tori fans would, but there was nothing about her miscarriage, marriage, or her new album, From The Choirgirl Hotel. It was very well written, and intriguing as well. Good job Kalen Rogers!"
1,"Choppy narrative, too predictable","After reading Patty Jane's House of Curl which was an excellent book, this follow-up effort seems just that - a follow-up. The narrative changes point of view from chapter to chapter, and all the characters seem one dimensional (eg.,BiDi is vain, Sergio is sweet, Franny is tough etc). Unlike Patty Jane, I could easily see where each plot line was headed. Hope the next book is more like the the House of Curl."
1,poor print quality in KX-FP101 Fax,"The quality of received faxes for this machine is very poor. I am a fan of Amazon.com and don't like to return things, but the print quality resembles that of the old thermal faxes. I returned it.Also, beware that Panasonic is shipping this fax without the fax receiving tray, which you will need to order."
2,DVD set as a whole,"I purchased this as a set as it has an Audio-DVD with it. The regular DVD is fine, but you can't play the Audio-DVD as it has a CPPM code and it cannot be played by any DVD player or DVD program. It ask for the code which cannot be found. To be honest the only reason why I purchased it was for the extra tracks on the Audio-DVD.If someone can help me that would be nice by making a comment on this post."
4,Should be more widely read...,"The Argonautika should be as widely read as the Iliad and the Odyssey (or for that matter the Aeneid). Before reading this particular version one should first study the structure of the work, completly discarding Green's Introduction to it, unless, of course, you happen to be a working classical scholar! The translation of Apollonios Argonautika is an excellent read, made much more understandable by the excellent Glossary, which provides background information on all the characters and gods mentioned in the epic, and on geographical locations as well. This glossary is either an excellent first source of information or as a refresher to what the reader might already know. Excellent maps detailing the route the Argonauts took are found in the back of the book. Although an excellent read, it's not one that should be done at a rapid pace! The bibliography makes no mention of Robert Graves narative work on Jason and the Golden Fleece, Hercules My Shipmate."
4,Review of Green's 'Argonautkia',"I no longer doubt Green's skills as a classics editor. All of his seem a pleasure to read. The introduction to this translation is specially well-written, and that's to say nothing of the poem itself--a memorable experience. However, this translation does have one major snag. The book uses end notes instead of a footnotes (these are very extensive, I might add)."
1,Certainly one can do better,Green writes like a pompous ass. He throws in whatever tropes will push the academic buttons but he totally misses Apollonius. A truly excellent translation has yet to be written.
4,functional,"well made, roomy pockets, everything we need fits when going for a run or hike, looks no more dorky than any other fanny pack"
1,Plastic!,I was a bit disappointed when it arrived because I thought it was a chrome frame and it was white plastic!
2,Not written for non-jews.,"I purchased this book in hopes of learning more about the jewish faith. However, the topics as well as the explanations are specific to those who have an intimate knowledge of judaism already. Many jewish terms are given in their hebrew names without translation making the book useless for non-jews."
5,cabbella awesum,i like da gayme much much. it vey fun. u try u like. i shooot bare he atak me. i kill wol;f 1 timee. i like cabela vey much much muuch u try u likee.v bye bye....
5,This one works!,"Want to change those harsh and fearful little voices inside your head to a more healthy and serene sound? Want to learn to face your fears and enjoy the present? Read this book.After decades of ""what if's..."" ""should haves"" and negative fantasies, these easy to understand theories and techniques changed my life. There's not a lot of jargon here...just insightful examples and realistic hope.Happy reading."
2,Disappointing at best,Considering the rave reviews of other readers I was expecting much more from this book. There are a few decent suggestions in the book but most often it gets lost among a bunch of worthless information. Chapter 5 on inner talk is worth reading but not much else is. Chapter 10 has a few decent suggestions on positive visualization. The whole section on sacred anxiety is spacey and unproductive! ... All the charts and graphs are a silly waste of time....
5,There ARE fun music books!,"What a great book! I am not very musically inclined so I thought learning the ukulele would be difficult. I borrowed this book from a friend and was amazed how well it is laid out for beginners like me! The cartoons also help to keep my spirits up while practicing those chords!! I had to buy TWO books, one for me and one for someone else to borrow!"
2,Poor choice of music,"In short the movie comes off slow for the first hour or more. The acting is weak and it all feels amateurish. However if you make it to the end the overall story is kind of nice. I don't regret seeing it. So I kindly give it two stars.I feel that with better directing the story could have been much more exciting where as it is now it is not gripping at all. The ""bad guys"" are played by some very mild manner charterers who come off so no threatening its ridiculous. The music itself is not bad it is just not fitting. Instead of the music being written for each scene a snippet of an existing known score is inserted. So the movie has no overall musical theme. Just giving this movie its own musical score would drastically change the atmosphere and carry it through.If you're looking for a different kind of western with a strong moral message then I recommendThe Big Country [Blu-ray]"
5,Awesome nailer,"I've owned this nailer for about 5 years. I've used it to put up over 2 miles of custom made trim work in my house, plus countless other projects.The Pros:- excellent Senco quality- 1000's of nails and only... uh, did I ever get a jam? I can't really remember. Maybe I got one once. If I did, it was easy to clear and apparently not overly memorable.- ease of loading- nice non-marring tip- angled nail rack allows you to get into tight corners- light enough to use all day.- relatively quiet.The Cons:- uh... can't really think of any. It would have been nice if it would have come with a free case of beer! That's about all I got.If mine ever died or was stolen, I'd buy another in a heartbeat!"
2,waste of money,"This cd is a waste of money. The last one(2003) was a lot better, and you should buy that one , not this one, because this one sucks"
5,VERY UNIQUE,THIS CD IS GREAT BECAUSE IT HAS A LOT OF BANDS THAT EVERYONE LIKES AND HEAR ON THE RADIO BUT THE SONGS ARE NOT THE ONES THAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY ARE DIFFERENT SONGS ON THE CD SO YOU GET SOMETHING DIFFERENT THAN WHAT YOU HEAR ON THE RADIO. THIS CD ROCKS!!!
5,Great Book for Kids and Adults to Read,"I bought this when my kids had their first soccer season after wondering what in the world the ref meant about indirect/direct, etc. during a game.I wanted to understand the sport and the rules as I was a newcomer to soccer (as were my children). My husband and I read the book and then so did my then 7 and 9 year old boys. It was easy for them to read and understand so it is great for their reading level. The book not only talks about the rules and strategies but it has some good history on soccer.In addition, thanks to the book my husband ended up coaching a season of soccer and I backed him up as team manager and coached a few games myself without that deer in the headlights look."
1,Stone mason,I actually never got to try it on a job. The first one I received was defective. The crosshairs weren't even visible. I got a replacement a couple days later and that too was defective. The leveling bubble was about 4 times the size it should have been. I gave up after that and bought a DEWALT through Amazon and I have had no problems.
2,Pricing themselves out of the market ?,"This is the tastiest gum I've ever chewed! (While you wouldn't think that combining bubblegum and spearmint flavor would be enjoyable,EVERY person who's tried this gum for the first time - Liked it a lot!)The company's shipping was both seamless and quick. Unfortunately,the price,which was a bit high to start - has increased...as has the shipping cost (the latter, almost as much as an entire box!)"
3,Cinnamon bread mix,Bought this for breadmaker. Makes 2 loaves and it is more practical for people who prefer to use loaf pans in the traditional oven. The batter is too large for the breadmachine that makes 1 1/2 or 2 lb. loaves. The taste and texture were fine but I didn't plan on having to bake in oven.
5,GREAT DVD,"I bought this dvd for my dad and IT IS GREAT!!!!! I love this music, and it is a really pleasure to enjoy it with my family. I DO recomend it to everybody."
4,Last Man Standing review,I was a bit disappointed. I thought there would be more songs with a 'rock beat' to them - similar to the first song on the CD. Otherwise it would be a good party CD
1,DVD is not even close to CD,"I first bought the CD which is out of the world great!!! So I was excited to see the DVD and ordered it. Much to my dismay the DVD did not have ANY of the great songs of the CD. Missing were, Pink Cadilac with the Boss, Rock n Roll with Jimmy Page, Rod Stewart and many others. I cannot understand how the DVD and CD have the same name??? Very disappointed"
2,Wonderful songs ruined by duets....,"The Killer is in good form here. His aged voice lends a sandpaper like quality to these songs. I love the killer and he's in fine form on this album. I think it is a bad record though. Why? The duets ruin in for me. They are all terrible and the album would have been much better with Jerry Lee singing alone. The only one that really works is ""Twilight"" with Robbie Robertson because he just puts in backround singing and guitar. Shows what this album could have been. I love Jerry Lee, but I would not get this one if I was you. Perhaps download ""Twilight,"" but that's it."
1,Early 1960's racism,"If your into one sided propoganda news reels & training films you will like this, If your into the technology used in Vietnam you will like some of this.But if you are looking for unbiased information on the Vietnam war or your interested in seeing any kind of battle footage you've come to the wrong place, I was discusted to see news reels portraying the Vietnamese as inferior savages who will take no prisoners.For the record the NVA & VC did take prisoners, yes some were tortured but the US also tortured the Vietnamese. This is not me bashing the US this is me saying if your going to show racist footage at least be decent enougth to admit the US did it as well."
5,Great CD,I think this CD is one of the best teen albums a singer has put out. Alecia has a very powerful and intriging voice. I'd definently recommend it. It's worth the money!
1,"Gee, ANOTHER teeny bopper","I bought this cd because I enjoyed the uplifting song ""I'm Diggin'It"". When I listened to the whole cd, I noticed all the songs sounded the same. People, this is just another version of Britney Spears, country style. If you want good country, buy Reba or Faith Hill. I am very disappointed."
1,Don't Support Anti-Muslim Hysteria; Don't Buy This Book,"Peter King wants to write a book about 9-11, fine. But by stating that 85% of mosques have leadership that support extremism is patently ridiculous. How the heck does he know? Did he visit every mosque to find out? Of course not, he's using this statistic that he grabbed out of his you-know-what to dishonestly market and hype his book. He's hoping that by picking on a minority group in the US that has no political/economic means to fight back that he can then make a quick buck. It's disgusting and it should disgust every American that an elected government official would attempt to promote his book by fomenting fear and loathing of American Muslims. Shame on you, Congressman King."
1,"Dry, good for a flight","It was a somewhat interesting viewpoint into the life of a veteran politician, though it hardly needed to be 300 hundred pages. Borrowed from a friend, am glad I didn't have to spend 25 bucks."
1,This doll sucks!!,"This doll has a big head and she is very ugly don't ever ever never ever ever buy this doll it is a piece of junk,if you put it in the bath there will be brown stuff coming out of her head I'm serious put her in the bathtub and see yourself and they copy myscenes i say buy a my scene instead.Hope this helps"
5,Best drill in this price range by far,"I repeat: Best drill in this price range by farI've done a lot of construction and have had the ""luxury"" I guess you could say, of using high-end, expensive tools. This one runs as well as any of them. Run it and run it, no burn smells, no kick backs, doesn't lose power; the feel is as sturdy as they come and the operation is flawless. You want this drill!"
2,"low price, fair drill, terrible batteries","Must echo what other reviewers said about the batteries. They don't last well at all compared to other makers batteries. The drill is fair, though not really a professional tool, and a bit heavy for what it does. I got this in a set with a recip saw, circular saw, jigsaw, and this drill. Quality of all of the saws is better than the drill, and they are useful tools, but the batteries are terrible. Now I have to buy more batteries so that I can use the other tools. Usually I use a different drill though."
5,Helpful cartooning tool,I liked the Pitt Artist Pens 8 Assorted Black by Faber-Castell so much that I decided to order these Faber-Castell earth tone brush pens for adding color. I'm very happy with the colors.
1,disappointing,Looks like I am the odd man out here so far.Burn was such a great guy in the first novel --- it made me wish I had a cousin like that. Which is why it was such a disappointment that 1) this story was so dull and 2) he ended up with someone so unworthy of him!
4,"Cool . . . almost radical, but not quite.","The pokemon Pikachu virtual pet is a cute idea and a fun piece of popular culture but the designers didn't really take it to fruition. I appreciated the idea of a toy that interacts with the user based on physical movement but the level of interaction is lacking and Pikachu's growth was not especially fun to watch. The ending was particularly disappointing. Once he reaches 1 million steps, he ceases to function and you must reset him. No fanfare, no fireworks, just some pixelated text. All in all, the pokemon pikachu virtual pet represents an exciting new horizon in interactive children's toys and a fun pop-culture item but the technology and design just aren't quite there yet."
4,KATELAND,"LITTLE GIRL LOST..I have to admit that i felt rather worn out after watching THE MIRROR. Its fast paced, hectic, and noisy. What with all the fast traffic in TEHRAN, and there didnt seem to be any road rules either. And here was this little girl right out on the road in the mist of it all. This film is about a little girl who is all alone and lost amongest the traffic and crowds in TEHRAN. For a little girl she seemed to have a tired old face about her, this could be due to worry and exhaustion. You felt for her at times. You knew knew what she was going through, it all showed on her little face. This little girl was also the actress in the interesting film THE WHITE BALLOON. If you watch The Mirror, you will be shown all around TEHRAN, its a very different place, but i took alot of interest. An enjoyable film, that had alot happening in it.t"
1,over-stated and not very functional,"I bought this bag because of the advertised capability to be used either as shoulder bag or a waist pack. It doesn't wear well either way. The belt for the waist pack is close to the bottom of the bag, so it feels like the bag is going to topple over when wearing in this position. When you wear it as a shoulder bag and you swing the bag to the front to retrieve your gear, the bag is tilted to the outside because of extra wide shoulder belt on the back side of the bag. Would you like to place your camera in an un-even bag? Plus, I don't see how it could be worn as a backpack. I am keeping the bag only to avoid the hassle of returning it to Adorama, wish I didn't buy it in the first place. This was supposedly designed by a professional photographer....."
1,Do not buy it !!!!!,"I used my drill just 2 times (10 minutes) as a hammer drill,and is not working anymore..."
1,poorest drill ever,"The drill failed on the first use, puts Black and Decker at the bottom of my list as a tool supplier"
1,Bad drill,"I drilled 1 hole(3/8"" about 2"" deep) using a carbide bit with this drill and reverse quit working. I gave it 1 star because i cant give it zero."
3,"Skil 2887-06 18 Volt 2-Speed Cordless 2 Speed 3/8"" Drill/Driver","Skil 2887-06 18 Volt 2-Speed Cordless 2 Speed 3/8"" Drill/DriverI played with this unit as several display units in stores. I decided to buy one for myself. After extensive use, I am not as thrilled with it as originally I was. After three full power battery discharge and recharge cycles are completed, does each battery last for a considerable period longer. The drill bit does not spin a perfect diameter leaving each drill off a bit and screws are not perfect in drive. For the price, the value is ok. Paying full retail, it is overpriced! There are better units. This has nice looks, though, if that is what you want."
2,The razor that these fit is slick but these blades are dull,"I don't get much of any shave effect at all with these blades. I bought the Merkur moustache/eyebrow razor to trim the inside areas of my beard which are too small to accurately cut with my double edge razor. The razors themselves are designed well but these blades just seem to pull the hairs. I tried using an electric trimmer first then following with the Merkur and Proraso shaving soap and there wasn't really any difference, I still had little stubbles left from the electric trimmer. Hopefully Merkur will improve on the blade design or somebody else will produce one, I would like to see razor actually work."
4,Decent brackets,"Well built fairly low profile brackets. These do not work for the small bose speakers with the standard articulated configuration. I think they could have been made to work in an ""ultra low-profile manner"", but that would have been by ""MacGyvering"" them. Otherwise, no complaints."
5,Better than OmniMount and Others!,"I paid $24 for a these mounts and they are worth every penny. I bought these to replace my OmniMounts that I bought 5 years ago for $60, they wore out and wouldn't hold my speakers up anymore. The cheaper Atlantic Mounts out lasted the more expensive OmniMounts."
4,Fabulous,"These are great and for the price a great bargain. I had avoided pricier mounts over the years but when I moved to a new house I decided that I wanted a classier look by mounting my surround sound system speakers. I am glad I came to Amazon and found these, they were easy to put up and my speakers are blasting."
3,It'll Do The Trick,"So I went ahead and bought these brackets to use with the Energy 5.1 Classic Home Theater System.I did this based off a suggestion by Amazon, while I was checking out.They do what they're supposed to - and they are built well.The only negative thing I have to say is about the installation process.Granted - it is not likely there is a better way to hang these brackets, other than what the instructions dictate - but it was a little bit of a challenge to hang them, when by myself.Again - it's doubtful there is a better way hang them - but it would've been nice if a little genie would've popped out and magically took care of hanging my speakers and brackets!Overall, this is a good product and I WOULD recommend these to a friend.Take care"
2,Very dissapointed,After reading the previous reviews I saw some people say that you have to fiddle around with them to get them to stay in place at the angles you want. Only 1 out of the 4 I put up stays in place where I want it. It has taken numerous times of trying to fix each of these to get them to work right and I still am not having any luck. I suggest spending a little bit more and buying nicer onces.
2,Cheaply made speakrer mounts,"Ordered metalic looking speaker mounts. Received wrong color and processing time for order was lengthy. These are cheaply made plastic mounts that will work to hold up speakers, but the consumer may want to look elsewhere for a sturdier product. Installation instructions are lacking on detail for installing in dry wall versus wall studs."
3,Doesn't fit Energy Take Classic satelite speakers...,"They seem pretty sturdy, but they don't fit the Energy Take Classic satellites. Luckily I can gift these, so it's not a total loss."
1,This is a piece of crap,"Spend a few more bucks a buy a better drill. This drill broke within the first hour of use. The chuck disengaged as soon as it encountered any real resistance, making it impossible to drill anything. Black and Decker used to make descent tools. It now seems that they are producing nothing but junk. Stay away from this drill."
3,Just an old PBS special. I was disappointed.,More of a documentary than anything else. Mostly old stuff from his black and white TV show during the fifties. Almost nothing from his acts later in life. Too much moderator talking to suit me.
4,good pick by sundance,"Nice little movie that really questions, is love real or just a series of chemical reactions that push us to do or say different things that our brains processes as love or lust. Both Livingston and Llyod do a great job of not overacting their parts and there is a 'chemistry' about the two of them that is not overpowering but gradually grows as the movie progresses."
4,Useful for the beginner,Is useful for the beginner. Has some good resources to further pursue. A handy starter one time read. Not a resource guide
5,Excellent introductory book on OO analysis and design,"I have recently started to use this book in an undergraduate application development course which I have taught for the past 5 years. I must have looked at around 30 books before I chose this one. The book I used before this was Rumbaugh's Object-oriented modeling and design copyright 1990. The administration was on me to get a newer textbook.This book is easy to read and covers quite nicely the standard OO concepts of encapsulation, inheritance, aggregation, polymorphism, message sending, etc. I like the way it starts with a simple application, then adds complexity.It does not overload the student with details of UML but covers the main constructs. It does not present a lot of actual implementation code. One 20 page chapter is devoted to OO programming in Java.A good introductory text but not suitable for graduate work."
2,You get what you pay for,"Gutless wonder. I bought it because it was cheap. My 3/8"" drill is faster, has more torque, and takes longer to overheat. It still works after three years, but that's because I don't use it. If you're a serious fabricator, spend some money."
4,NO DRILL BIT,"The last time I bought a drill there was at least one bit and sometimes one for steel, wood. So I received my drill two days ago and can not use it because I had to order bits and wait for them to come but I most likely would have given this drill 5 stars if I had got one bit with it."
4,Great pants,I really like these warm up pants. But I wish they had a few different inner seams. Otherwise there very confortable.
1,I've Had Lots of Power Tools,"Needed a new jig saw to cut some countertops. I did some research into this saw and liked the amps and size. I have never used an orbital saw before, but sounded like a good idea. Imagine my surprise when my cut was all over when freehanding and still horrible when using a straight edge. I tried all three settings but all cut the same. I do like the quick blade release but that is about it. I almost wrecked an expensive countertop and had to pull out my 10 old reliable skill jig saw. Would not recommend it and would return it if I hadn't thrown away the box."

2,dull and plodding,"Awful editing/proofreading. A few examples:""The pair hurriedly placed space heaters around us and PEALED away our wet coats.""""...wear good shoes with a little extra lift or HEAL.""""SHEAR chaos""Huh??"
5,Great Gift,Gave these to three groomsmen for my wedding and had them engraved at a local business. Best price on this leatherman that I could find.
5,The best book available.,"If only one book on current issues in U.S. public schools were to be read, Bruce N. Shortt's ""The Harsh Truth about Public Schools"" would be the most helpful."
3,"Note the picture, week starts Monday","The quality is good, and it's handy to have the holidays for Canada and Mexico in there so you know when people won't be in. But I'm having to stop using mine because it has the week starting on Monday. It sounds like a good idea, saving space by combining Saturday and Sunday into the same square, but after months of accidentally scheduling Monday things on the date for Tuesday, I'm giving up. You'd think you would get used to the week starting on Monday, but since few other calendars have the week start on Monday, I never really did get used to it.Some people may love this product and not have a problem with it but I thought I'd share my experience in case it was useful."
3,Canadian Rockies for Dummies,"This is quite a good book for do it yourself people. For us I was looking for tour information, both day tours and ones of several days, so for us it was disappointing that it didn't cover this as well."
3,Adeuqate at best,"This book is OK, with some useful information. So far I've just been browsing through it, reading parts, I'd give it a fair to good. My wife and I are plannign a trip to the Candadian Rockies later this summer and will take this book along...I may change my opinion after that...we'll see."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Not bad, but not as good as the first novel, Tea From an Empty Cup. This is pretty much a stretched novella, I presume. The book is more of the same theme, exploring the problems of policing virtual worlds, especially when they can be in any country at any time. Then those doing the policing have to work out what is a crime, to start with."
1,Don't bother!,"Bah! What an uninteresting piece of garbage. I have not failed to finish a book in about four years. This tripe will now reset the timer. The characters are flat, the plot absurd, the action stilted. I made it to page eighty-four, and that is that! Actually the best part of the book, up to where I gave up, concerned an arms deal gone bad. Even there, the writing was poor."
2,Buyer Beware - No Audio in Video mode on S3000,"Bought this camera at a best buy store - Salesman said it was the new improved variety of the older FinePix 3800. I had been planning on buying a 3800 soon, before Christmas - since I was all ready sold on my daughter's FinePix 2800, which is a great camera and uses batteries so sparingly (3800 and 2800 are pretty much the same camera but with different pixel densities).However, after I got the S3000 home and shot a few pics, I discovered that this so called 'IMPROVED' version of the 3800 has NO AUDIO mode for the video - whew! what an improvement, 'silent digital movies.' When I returned the 3000 to the store for a refund, I discover that best buy has a 15% restocking fee - cost me $45 to return. Unhappy me.So today I am searching the net for a good buy on the older 3800, which has Audio & Video - and only a 6X zoom, less than the 10X zoom on the S3000.So do you want Audio and Video or 10X zoom?"
5,Great Camera!,"I just bought this camera and I love it!Plus all the features already mentioned, there is something else people should know: The WEBCAM feature on this camera. When you switch the camera to PC-Mode on the setup menu, you obtain an excelent and very handy high resolution Webcam wich you can use for VideoConferencing with your friends and family. It works with most of videoconference softwares,like Yahoo, MSM messenger, NETmeeting and many more. As soon as you plug your camera in PC-Mode to your computer, it will detect it as a WebCam device. Try it, you will love it!"
1,"Very Bad, I hate every company trying to make Non-Standar Products!","If you though this would be the easy PnP camara... naaaaa! Bad drivers, and the Awful thing is: The USB Cable, if you lose it, you're busted. Why does a company needs to come up with a Non-Standar Cable, why? for What? to get money from you when buying the replacement? that's stupid.Power consumption... another flaw, just a couple of pictures and you're off, total discharge of 4, yes four AA batteries.The rest is acceptable, like any other camera of its generation."
2,Chuck does not hold well,"I agree completely with the review posted by Andy F. ""JAF"". The keyless chuck cannot grip tight enough. I even tried tightening it with slipjoint pliers - the rubber covering just slips. The poor quality switch also failed on me. I was able to fix it by cleaning it, and now it works fine. The drill runs smooth for an inexpensive model. My biggest complanint is the weak grip chuck. I will attempt to replace it with a keyed chuck or replace the drill entirely."
3,decent read !!,"this book is a reprint of the original and a little bit short in length for my taste. That being said, it is full of detail and has some great information and the true feel of the times. (1840's america fur trade era). The Good Doctor wrotevery well and includes a lot of interesting observations and how life really was then; not only for him but the people, animals, and territory around him on his journey. I would love to find an original copy of this book complete with maps.They are cut out of this reprinted volume."
3,Fun but pricy,"This stationery set is really fun, especially if you are a fan of ""Where the Wild Things Are."" There isn't a lot that's included for the price, though. The design on the back of the stationery makes it nearly impossible to write on, so plan on only using one side of the paper."
2,Not so good for Animorphs,"I didn't think it was a good book, it was kindof boring, sorry. It did show cat instincts good though and we got into the mind of a cat."
3,Back to the 80's,"Just as Lenny Kravitz seems stuck in a time warp that currently has him stranded in the 70's, so is Scotland Yard stuck in the 80's. If your musical references happen to be all ""rock of the 80's"" bands, however, Scotland Yard is the band for you. Tracks like ""No Regrets"" and ""Something Good"" sound like lost Berlin and Missing Person tracks; ""Movin' On"" could've come off the first Kim Wilde album. If this is what you want, then by all means, buy this album - it's tailor-made for you, and you can adjust the star rating up one star. However, if you didn't like ""rock of the 80's"" when it was the 80's, adjust it down one star. 24/7 is fun, smartly written and ingratiating music, but it's often difficult to separate the band from their very obvious influences."
1,"If you're an Asian looking for a dim sum book, this is not the one for you.","I would like to start off by saying that I am Chinese. I grew up eating dim sum on Saturday and Sunday mornings.This book does not have the classic dim sum that you would find in restraunts. You'll be disappointed finding a few recipes out of the woderful 128 page book. This is far from what you really want to find. If you're trying to find a book that you can call a teacher, look for the chef in the kitchen of your restaurant instead. This book won't help you on your quest to learn how to make dim sum at home.But if you like some desserts, pick this up."
1,very poorly made a peice of crap,this product is totally worthless and does not have any power to do nothing. better off using a screw driver. totally worthless robert_casey@sbcglobal.netnot even worth sending back for a refund threw it away within 72 hours totally worthless
5,best cordless screwdriver i have ever used,"I bought one years ago, and after many years and a lot of use, it just stopped working. I went to see if it was still available at Home Depot or Lowes...they had some new versions...But I LOVED this one, so I bought another one off amazon...and bought 3 more for my brothers and dad.Highly recommend. Works well with the right adapter pieces and an assortment of bits."
4,Great for around the house,"I've had this for a few years now, and overall I've been very satisfied with it. I primarily use it for driving screws, but I do use the drilling setting on occasion. I've drilled through wood and drywall, and I wouldn't use it for anything harder given the power it has. The keyless collar lets me pop different bits in and out on the fly very quickly. This does however, use a NiCad battery, which does not hold a charge as long as the newer lithium batteries. But for occasional, around the house use, it's fine. I just have to charge it up in advance of when I know I'll be using it. Overall, a great little tool."
4,Does the job effectively...,I needed a drill to put on child locks to all out cabinets and was looking for a good drill. I found this on a deal and bought it. It works very effictively and I'm happy with the purchase. I used it to drill screw holes into wooden cabinet doors and it is very effective and handy tool.
1,Powerless,"I should've known that 6 volts was too little, but I had no idea how powerless this cordless screwdriver is. Can't even drill a screw into the wall (plain old drywall) with it--it was easier to do it by hand!"
1,"Useless, does not hold its charge","I wouldn't buy this again because it never holds a charge, whenever I go to use it its dead. I then recharge it having to wait to complete my chore. Next time I go to use it even a day later, its dead again. Not worth it if battery must be charged before every use!"
4,"Reliable, but lacks power","I've had the older single speed version of this screwdriver for many years, and it's always there when I need it. It does take a long time to charge, but seems to hold the charge forever, I can just pick it up and it always works.I've used it to assemble several pieces of flatpack furniture, and to hang many items on interior drywall. However, when compared to newer higher voltage cordless drill/drivers, it lacks power and speed, but if you're only looking for a lightweight automatic screwdriver, this is the one for you.The version I've got certainly doesn't have enough power to be used a s a drill"
1,worthless,It looked great and all of the reviews I read made this cordless screwdriver sound awesome. Unfortunately it was a total waste of money. All it does is strip every screw and I end up going back to the old fashioned screwdriver to finish even the simplest job. Don't bother! I'm still searching for a cordless that won't strip the heads and will save me the effort and agony of a manual screwdriver.
3,Miss American made products,"Excellent features on this tool and suited for general home use. Unfortunately, this tool had a defect that eliminated the feature I wanted and that was 2 speed control.The switch for changing speed was not opererative and rendered it useless. An obvious defect. This would not be if the tool was manufactured by Black & Decker in the U.S.A. I do not have confidence in machines, tools or electronics made in China."
4,great for the little jobs,"For all normal intents and purposes, this is a wonderful power screw driver. Maybe not for heavy duty construction use, but I'm very happy using it for light duty work around the home. The power is decent, and the ease of use can't be beat."
2,More Power To You,"If you are drilling and setting screws in balsa wood this is your tool. Otherwise, find a ""power screwdriver"" with some POWER."
4,Best of the small portables,"This is a replacement for the same model I got many years ago. Battery would not hold a charge -replacement battery cost $20 so I just bought a new one. Could not find any other model with as good of power, features or value."
2,Battery woes,"I have had this device for about a year. Its battery cannot hold a charge. The drill is never functional when I want to use it. I have to plan several hours ahead. Whoever schedules a pick-up-and-use tool 6 hours ahead? The only option would be to leave it plugged in all the time. I do not fancy that. Am I missing something? Otherwise it works well. However, I can only recommend the drill to those who are going to use it every couple of days - before the charge drains."
3,Replaced my power drill,"This is the second one that I have purchased when the battery died on the first one after few years. I stopped using my power drill after getting this product. Highly recommended. I thought I'd start writing reviews because I myself depend on what other people write, and I have almost passed up on good products due to lack of sufficient volume of good reviews.Edit: 12/18/12: It died this past weekend, does not charge any more. My first one lasted quite a while so I am not sure what went wrong with this one. I bought a Dewalt to replace it."
1,No power and it broke,"This isn't really a cordless drill, it's a abomination. This worthless piece of junk never had enough power to finish putting in a screw. I'd always have to do in manually, then the piece of trash died, and I used it sparingly and less than year. Don't buy, you need to buy a drill with more power and that actually works."
3,Pretty good for the price,"The only issue I had with this device was that when I first got it, the torque control collar stuck so badly that I thought there was something I was doing wrong. But in fact once it un-seized and I could turn it freely, it's performance was fine. Not the best device of its kind, but perfectly adequate for most household jobs."
2,"Powerful, but battery runs down.","When you try to get a tool to do too much, you always fail. Electric drills are more powerful and don't quit when you need them."
2,Battery Charge Poor,I like it for small work around the house but it will not hold a charge. As long as you leave it on charge it is okay. If you leave it a couple days in a drawer off charge it goes dead.
3,"good idea, flawed execution","There are lots of things to like about this screwdriver. Very good ergonomics, handy hex bits, fairly nice clutch, built in LED light. But there are significant minuses too:1. The transmission that changes the speed from ""drive"" to drill"" is on the top and is very easy to bump, knocking the gears from one setting to the other, or into neutral. Also, you sometimes need to spin the motor for a second to get the thing into a gear.2. The switch on the LED light can be defective. On my model, it frequently gets into a mode where it's impossible to turn off! Only repeated jiggling gets it off. Annoying, and a dealbreaker if it gets worse.3. The included drill bit is really cheap and dulls very quickly.4. As others have noted, there's no tape measure in the handle, contrary to the description. No biggie."
1,don't bother...,"this doc. sucks. don't even waste your money. It barely gets one star...and I guess that would be for some old archival footage and to honor Frida's unsinkable beauty. The same photos are used over and over, with cheesy voice over narration. I was left completely unsatiated. if you're looking for a good Frida documentary, try PBS' The Life and Times of..."
2,Tedious version,"This is one LOOONG drawn out version of ""In C."" (76:20) Twice I've listened to this tedious version. Once I was wondering how much longer will it take by checking out track index on the display of the CD palyer. The other time I press stop halfway through so I could take a break, then continued the next day. I noticed that several seconds after ""In C"" finally finishes, there was an applause. Made me wonder if, at least, some people were clapping because they were relieved that this is finally over. I decided to sell it to someone who may not mind this LOOOONG drawn out version. I prefer shorter versions on the 1968 recording on CBS and the 1998 Bang-On-A-Can recording. Consider one of THEM (or both), especially if you're not familiar with ""In C."""
4,return,"it was nice a nice ring, but too small, btw did you receive the ring when i returned it on January 19th?"
2,who's been note taking in my book!,"lot of writing and note marking in the text by previous owner/s. Not in very good condition. Still, it arrived n time and is perfectly legible."
3,Third and fourth albums of the lively ones... They should have stopped after the third,"Two very different albums of the lively ones on the same CD :Surf City is a good album with some real good surf instrumentals (tranquilizer, misirlou,...) and a good sound even if all the tracks were not recorded at the same time and do not sound the same.For the Surfin south of the border they added jazz musicians (trumpet, sax,...) and they play classics of latin instrumentals (tequila, watermelon man, mexico...)...The result is surf music for Las Vegas shows!... forget this album."
2,too hard for me,"I have crocheted for a very long time, but never jewelry. It looked tough and there were only a few designs I would actually wear so I returned the book. My style is simple and casual so it may suit others who can carry a more elaborate look."
4,Music in Their Blood,"Small bands like the one on this recording are ubiquitous around Lake Toba, and are employed for a wide variety of occasions, from the inauguration of a distinctively beautiful Batak house to the funeral I accidentally attended years back, in which men, inside a circle, went counter-clockwise and women, in an outer circle, went clockwise -- all of them clutching generous portions of raw meat. (After asking permission, I took a number of photographs, then, trying to get a good shot, almost fell backward atop the corpse.)This music lacks the sophistication of the Javanese or Balinese gamelans, but is distinguished by its piquant and unusual harmonies, particularly those produced by blaring, nasal wind instruments. Even without their bands, the Bataks love their music. Not a small boat on the lake is without its joyful or lamenting singer/whistler. This disc gives an excellent idea of the spirit of it all."
3,Good product but with a few kinks,I just got my color blackberry and I like it quite well overall - but there are a few kinks - such as it freezing up 2-3 times a week.
3,Great hardware...Be wary of T-Mobile,"Simply put, this hardware device is amazing...Easy to use and intuitive.That said T-Mobile is really annoying. I signed-up for the 29.99 plan with Enterprise Server Access, which worked for 2 months before I was informed by T-Mobile that I would need to switch to a $39.99 plan to maintain Enterprise Server Access."
4,Melodic Scales,"Very technical, obviously. Not for the faint of heart. But if you have some theory background and want to fill in some of the gaps, this is a great resource. I am still learning from it."
5,My Favorite Lindsey novel!,This is my favorite Lindsey novel...and I have read all 45! I love every bit of this story. Angel is my all-time favorite hero!
1,Poorly made batteries,"The batteries B&D; uses are not well made. The ones we have are literally falling apart after 2 years (of only occasional use). The replacements are in the 40-50$ range. Each. And since you really need two, that means spending almost 100$ each time they are replaced.Find a better product."
5,An extremely helpful and enlightening work!,"This book is great! After the September 11th tragedy, I was seeking some clarity in what was transpiring over in the Middle East; more so than what the news service could offer me. After reading this book, I really felt that I understood what was going on. I found it intriguing that Ms. Mylroie had published this book before the second attack on the World Trade Center. The last line in the work is so prophetic! After reading this book, there was no doubt in my mind that Saddam Hussein has to be taken out in order for us to win the war on terrorism.I have been loaning this book to many of my friends and they have also found it helpful and enlightening"
5,Insightful,I heard the author interviewed on the Dennis Prager radio show and was impressed. She is an expert in Iraq and its meglomaniac leader.Her insights into the failed policies of the Clinton adminstration make an insightful read. I highly recommend this book.
3,Everything You Wanted to Know About UFOs,"An interesting look at history, types, stereotypes and so forth with regard to UFOs and alien sightings and spacecraft. Nick Pope is basically a go-to guy in this field."
2,club tune,"Im afraid fellow reviewer musiman is spot on, Kelis is good looking but when you hear this you can't help feeling that she just a backing vocalist and not that good too.This is a million miles away from beyonce or jill scott so her intro was a big mistake.Good for clubs to remix, but im being generous giving 2 stars. Tell you what if you don't believe me, listen to this then listen to Beyonce new album Bday, complete different class."
5,One to Remember,"I first saw this film when it was released in the 60s and it just registered with me . I ,for some reason remembered the film and subsequently in my middle years did some research on it and discovered it was based on some fact. I do remember the French withdrawel from Algeria and particularly the stand off between General Degaule and the Foreign Legion in refusing to return home .The stature of Quinn is convincing in this film as was in most of his films throughout his career .Highly recommended."
5,song on the commercial for notebook,"i think the movie soundtrack is terrific, just a blast from the past. The song that is not on the soundtrack but played on the tv commercical for the release of the dvd is called ""tonight and the rest of my life"" by nina gordon off her latest cd."
5,help me please,"im intrested in buying this cd, but before i do, could anyone who does have it tell me if the last two tracks are sound clips from the movie? (are the actors talking or are they just songs) thanks alot"
4,How All This Started,"Great book that focuses on a difficult subject. Austin, the narrator, provides a unique perspective for the growing awareness of his sister Abilene's condition and is witness to its effects on the entire family. I picked this book off a friend's bookshelf while vacationing at her home and within a few days was three quarters through it. I was unable to finish it there and so I purchased it when I returned home, so hooked was I on the story of Austin and Abilene. The story's sadness is balanced by the beauty of its telling, a close look at a family in a state of watchful caution and dread when one of its members slides into mental/emotional difficulties."
5,Haunting and beautiful,"Impossible to put this book down. As with ""Traveling Light"", Ms. Kittle takes on a difficult subject, but her writing is so beautiful and her characters so real, that the book is a real page-turner. I found myself caring so much about what happened to Jordan, but also to Sarah, Nate and Danny, that the book stayed with me long after I (reluctantly) turned the last page. I only hope Ms. Kittle is working on her next book and there are many more to come. She is a very gifted author."
4,"a page turner for sure, but didn't make me a better person","I LOVE a good book, one that I cannot put down, and this was one of those. It was well written, too. But, as I said in my title, I didn't feel like I learned anything that I took away with me. Yes, the characters were fairly well developed and you could relate to these people - but in the end, it didn't make me a better person for having read it. I like to learn something when I read, and although entertaining, I didn't feel like I learned anything, and it was basically a waste of time. An entertaining waste of time, but a waste none the less. Little Bee, for example, made me a better person, I learned something."
1,Nebraska cheats with a child molester.,"Nebraska ""beats"" MIZZOU with an illegally kicked ball (kicked by a convicted child molester who went to the slammer), and they call this spiritually inspiring?Please show some class Huskers!"
5,ULTIMATE DIRTY DANCING,WHAT A GREAT IDEA TO RE_RELEASE THIS ALBUM! this album is the soundtrack of the 80's and i cannot wait to hear it again! dirty dancing was certainly the best movie of the 80's which puts it up for best all time!
5,a wife pleaser,"Excellent device. Works as advertized and easy to install. I was able to install it with two children on the room and a nagging wife in the house, therefore I cannot recommed it more."
1,Incompatability,"Wasn't compatable with the Damango RC 3051 as described on the web page, or the product was defective."
1,"horrible (1 star is an overestimate, there is no zero)",This is the absolute worse CD I have ever purchased in my life. There is simply nothing to listen to except the twang of a string followed by minutes of silence. On one of tracks I didn't even hear a single sound until at least 2 minutes into the recording. I can't believe you can sell such tripe.
2,Not Enough Contrast,"Despite the fact that the jet faceted beads are nice and the bracelet is well made, the silver tone beads are antiqued and not as bright as I would have liked. If you like that antique look you will like this bracelet."
2,Biography dubious,I knew the author of this book. I was in his class my first year in college. He was an odd codger whose idolatry of Adlai Stevenson knows no bounds. The book is a curiosity that tells as much about the author as about the subject. Look for lavish praise and a ponderous style here.
4,i wish this had music videos,"i would have bought this dvd, but i noticed that none of her videos were included on it. i hope that christina releases a dvd with all of her videos on it so far. i would definitley buy it then!"
4,Live in the UK DVD!!!,"I hope this DVD is good.....because i know how the concert and its cool,i also hope that the DVD has the videos ofdirrty,beautiful,fighter,chud and the voice within......some xtra stuff too....."
5,"THE LATIN WOMAN ""WITH THE VOICE!""","UNFORTUNATELY I MISSED HER STRIPPED CONCERT THIS PAST YEAR BUT, I GOT TO SEE A GLIMPSE OF THE CONCERT ON THE WB AND IT WAS TOTALLY AMAZING!!!!!!!! I CANNOT WAIT FOR THAT DVD TO BE RELEASED IN EARLY APRIL 2004. I HAVE BEEN REQUESTING THE DVD SINCE THE DAY AFTER HER CONCERT @ THE ROSE GARDEN ON JUNE 10TH PORTLAND, OREGON. THEY MUST HAVE HEARD MY VOICE BECAUSE SHORTLY AFTERWARDS THE DVD WAS ANONYMOUSLY ANNOUNCED ON TRL.......THIS IS A MUST BUY FOR ANYONE WHO ENJOYS ALL KINDS OF MUSIC!!!!!! MUSIC FROM THE SOUL!!!!!!! I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE MISS AGUILERA PERFORM AT THE CLARK COUNTY AMPHITHEATER IN RIDGEFIELD, WASHINGTON ON MAY 16 WITH CHINGY... IT IS GOING TO BE THE CONCERT TOUR OF 2004!!!!!!!"
1,Confused?,"Why do you ask me to review the seller and then tell me I am not authorized to do so? Yet, I can review the product. I don't get it."
2,Chinese bearings .. ugh,"Chinese bearings. I don't care where something comes from if it is a quality bearing. However, Chinese made bearings have NOT had a good reputation. The fact that Hot Rods (sadly, most everyone else too) uses a product with questionable quality standards for a hard to replace part is very sad to me.Stick with OEM (Timken, Koyo, etc) and DO NOT SKIMP!"
1,what book,I ordered this book Jan.4 2002 and still have'nt received it.........what's up with this??????????
5,Contracts Case Summaries,"This book is amazing! It really helps to break down the confusing language and help bring out the most important points of the case decisions. Not only does the book provide briefs on the cases, but also provides important vocabulary and definitions from the case, as well as a paragraph for so of analysis for each case."
5,originally gorgeous,"Apologetica is a beautiful work, almost too much so. I bought the CD after reading a review of it in the Village Voice. The critic was right on this one. It deservesthe 5 stars the Voice gave it. Definitely the CD of that year... 1998."
4,It is what it is,"This product is nothing special. It doesn't do anything magical. You are getting what you pay for, but it does it's job, and that is why I bought it. I have a G1/HTC Dream and it fits, only in the vertical position, which is a bit disappointing. But it still functions and sticks to the window like nobody's business. Just make sure you clean your window before you put it up there, and it will never come down unless you pull it off yourself. I have had occasion when I have knocked the holder off the arm, but that is a position issue in my car, and not an issue with the unit itself."
5,Great But...,This product does everything you need it to as far as holding your phone. The only issue is that it is somewhat larger than expected. Fits G1 and any similar size model very nicely. Goes great with Chargers as well. Does take up a but of space though. Not Recommended if you have a window mount stand-alone GPS unit. (But the G1 can do GPS) .:-)
1,They Didn't Even Work!,i received the item on time but it didn't work right out the box and I tried resetting my printer and everything but it still didn't work...my printer kept saying that the cartridges weren't in the printer properly...i didn't get to contact the exact seller because I just wanted a refund instead of trying to get another one that may not work either.
5,It's top hat to be a cat....,It's not Dr. Seuss but it's as close as you can come and has been approved by Red Rover for its authenticity in elementary school humanitarian education. Wonderful pictures and great narrative!!!
1,TRASH,"Found under christian genre, its more hindu-ism or something. It was so bad, speaking about vocals and song writing ability, that even before I was done listening, I throw it out on to the highway. ITS BAD"
5,excellent product,"There are two reasons to buy this cable - high quality and convenience. Monster cables are extraordinary. I'm usually incapable of telling the difference between minor variations in sound and video quality, but after replacing cheap component cables with this, the picture seemed so much better.This design for the cable (where all conductors pass through the same sheath, instead of glued-together parallel wires) makes cable organization very easy. When you've got a home-theater system, there are so many players that need their own cables; the compactness of the cable helps keep the clutter down."
1,No Subtitles,"The King's College Choir DVD of Bach's St. Matthew Passion does not have subtitles, nor does the insert provide a translation."
4,"Two is company, three is a crowd","If you are a Jeri Ryan fan, this is a great opportunity to seeher demonstrate her versatility as an actress in a lead role.The storyline recalls Jean-Paul Sartre's ""Huis Clos"", but heredeveloped as a comedy.It is a very good film, and when you listen to the commentaryby Harry Ralston, Jeri Ryan, Dave Arnott and Dan Montgomery(in the bonus material), brace yourself for a lot more fun!""Two thumbs up!"""
2,For Jeri fans.,"I admit, I got this with the hopes of seeing more of Jeri Ryan (skin-wise), and ended up watching the entire movie to see her in a one-piece swimsuit for maybe 2 minutes max. There it is, disappointing. The movie was ok, about the last three people left on Earth because of.....well, who cares. It was interesting to see how even between just three people, there were was still hook-ups and jealousy and every other human emotion. Overall, it was a little more than a bore. For rental only, or Jeri's biggest fan."
4,A Hero's Space Journey,"A delightful read! The setting is carefully drawn in the mind's eye, the characters seem as real as friends and family. The plot unfolds as a hero's journey in space, complete with dramatic rescue of an innocent child, and the steadfast and resourceful companion, depicted here as a supercomputer with the ability to 'super size' itself in a remarkably sophisticated twist of technical alchemy.The story ended rather abruptly however, making one wonder if this book will become the first of a trilogy?"
2,Paint comes off teething bug,When I first purchased this I would have given it 5 stars! My son loved it! This was a great buy until my son got his first tooth. Once that tooth popped I found blue paint on his face and in his mouth. The paint on the teething bug comes off easily by an active teether. I hope we can find something else that is as entertaining to my son as this was.
1,Didn't fit our stroller,We have a Kidco double stoller. The Busy Bug Bar package says it fits ANY stroller. It didn't fit ours. It seems that if you don't have a tray on your stroller you can forget it.
4,stroller fun,"This toy is so nice to have if you use your stroller a lot. My baby has loved playing with this and I have even given this as a gift. The only thing that I did not like was that the cup that is the bugs legs, comes out. That is great for cleaning but if the baby takes it out, it can become yet another thing to keep track of during your ever so busy outings. Overall, this is a great and cute idea and gives some added fun for babies stroller time."
2,wouldn't work on my stroller,"I bought this for use on a couple of differnt places. It fit great on my graco swing but i really wanted it to work on my grace stroller and graco jumper. it would not work on my stroller at all. the velco strips were not long enough. I would be easy to make something to attach the velco strips but i didn't want to deal with that. I am going to look around some more for another stroller toy. The toy looks like it would be lots of fun, my 2 year old was enjoying for alittle while."
5,Best on high chairs in restaurants.,"We began using this toy bar on our Graco travel system stroller with the tray removed when our daughter was about 5 months old. We then started taking it into restaurants and attaching it to highchairs and it is the best! It doesn't fit snugly on some highchairs, but if we push it up to the table it works fine. Our daughter is 1 and still loves all of the toys on it. The only thing we don't like is the removable cup which we took out in the beginning, it was the first thing she learned to remove and throw from the chair. I highly recommend this for someone on the go to keep your baby occupied."
2,"cute, but.....","When we looked at this in the store, I thought it was really cute and I thought my baby would really enjoy it. We had just bought 2 new strollers (lightweight and jogger)and I was looking forward to putting something fun in front of baby to enjoy while we walk. Especially since the box said fits ALL strollers (in capital letters too). Nope, not ours (either). Granted, I understand why it doesn't fit and I could kind of see that it wouldn't work but I took it home anyway hoping it would have description of how to fit a stroller without a bar. I think I will keep looking. Too bad too, it looked like it was exactly what I was looking for"
2,Don't buy if you have Peg Perego Stroller!,"I was disappointed that the packaging says ""fits all stollers"" I have a Peg Perego Venezia and when the snack tray is on this toy can not fit on it! I also found that it does not stay in position easily if you can attach it to a regular size bar. Because of the round base it moves on the stroller making it difficult for your child to play with. I returned mine to the store the very next day!"
2,"It looks cute, but isn't very entertaining.","I have a Graco system, and I struggled to get this on the stroller. I did get it on, but it wasn't perfect. Also, my baby didn't seem interested in it. I put it on her crib, and she still doesn't play with it."
5,Best Busy Bar for the Buck!,"I bought this on a whim to keep my 4 month old happy in his stroller. Otherwise, I would be holding him while pushing the stroller! Well - he is now 9 1/2 months old and STILL loves it! He bites on the wings of the bee and chews on the bug attached with fabric. He doesn't ever seem to tire of this toy and I've been on marathon shopping sessions with him lasting a few hours!! I would recommend this to everyone as one of the must haves for under 12 months!"
4,Juan Gabriel is a great showman,"Juan Gabriel is slowing down with age, but nonetheless continues to be one of the great performers of all time! His physical energy has diminished over time, but not his enthusiasm to deliver his best effort. I enjoyed this DVD, and would recommend it to any fan of Juan Gabriel."
1,Had to Return,"Product that was shipped was defective - broken case. Was not as good a value as other that I saw later, too. I would stay away."
1,Spend a little more $$$,Had to send back first monitor for a faulty bulb pressure problem. Replacement monitor had the same problem and had to be returned also. Would probably spend a little more and get a better monitor.
1,IS A CHEAP!,"I was buy the Prevention DS-400PV Semi-Automatic Blood Pressure Monitor, but they sent me a different product and I can not return that brought them to Colombia. It is a fraud"
2,nice for a while,"About 1 month after buying this it had broken, something broke inside of it and the repairs cost more than what I had paid for it. It was accurate but if you want something to last a lot longer I would buy something different."
4,Great show and season....with reservations,"I think very highly of this series. The cast is great and the writing is spectacular. Season three is not an exception. But I would like to share one general issue with the show. The dialogue is what makes the series. It never fails to be witty, intelligent, and full of obscure references. The banter is quick, like players on a ping pong table. My issue is this....no one actually speaks this way. I don't know a single soul, let alone two people, who are capable of interchanges like this. The series often borders on being overwritten, even if the writing is what makes it great. I understand that there is artistic license taken here and I am willing to suspend my disbelief for such a great show. I just wanted to share my one reservation."
5,"Good, classic TV.",Really enjoyed the 3rd season. Repackage was nice and a a bit more user friendly than the traditional packaging. Wish more tv was like this.
5,Wonderful,Another success for the series.It's amazing to see how much can be done in such a small town.
1,Doesn't work in FinePix Z1,"Should be a direct replacement for the NP-40 battery for a Fuji FinePix Z1, but it never powers on or charges the camera."
4,Replacement battery for Nikon Camera,"Battery replacement for camera Nikon water damaged old one. Charged it for two hours, have not had to charge it since. Took over 68 photos for work with flash and focus, and still no charge needed.Great price and buy!"
5,perfect replacement battery for the Fuji FinePix V10,Needed a replacement battery for the Fuji FinePix V10 and this fit the bill. Battery life is outstanding.
5,The Best of Popular Concertos--George Greeley,Excellent in every way and wish more of his albums were on CD. Geroge Greeley is excellent in every way and a Music Collector's Must!
3,Very Well Written With Great Characters But Same Old Plot,"For some reason, all the MZB books I choose end up having the same plot: there's some dark underground sacrificial alter where dark forces are summoned & it's cramping the style of our heroines. Nevertheless I didn't mind as much this time because the main character's struggle with alcoholism and indulgent self-hatred was so brilliantly drawn. In fact, all of the characters and the way they related when they met were totally captivating. But like I've said before--oh no, not that whole lame devil worship plot again! This book would have deserved five stars had the supernatural possession happened more originally."
5,A Consistent Tasty Treat,"We've been buying from Choo Choo Snacks(Buffalo Bills) for almost 2 years now. No matter where I've been or what I'm doing, this is some tasty goodness. It's moist, easy to chew, with peppers on the beef visible through the bag! So far, I've tried all variations of the Country Cut. Barbecue and Teriyaki are sweet and true to their flavors. Honey Pepper is fairly sweet with that black pepper kick all over it. Mild is exactly as it says, mild(it would be like Spicy with no spicy hehe). Chipotle Habanero, though, is a whole different story. It is VERY spicy and the burn will stay in your mouth for a while longer as expected so be careful. Compared to buying Jack Link's for half the price(and almost half the flavor IMO), this is really good deal."
4,"Tasty, but not as soft as I would like.","The flavor of the jerky is great. It has a good background heat, but isn't super hot. They come in nice sized strips.The only negative I have to say about them is that they are not as soft as I would like. They aren't super hard, but I feel they could be a little more tender."
4,Very good jerky,"I'm working my way through most of the various types of Buffalo Bills' products and this one is the best so far. I concur with a previous reviewer that country cut is ""just right."" The spicy has good flavor. I would personally consider this 'mild' but I've rarely ever seen comercially prepared anything that was truely spicey."
5,jerky,"great stuff. ""Tastes great. I would recommend to all to try. It is spicy, it could be hotter, but it is flat out good."
1,not good for me,"this cd is ok except it has children and babies crying through out it. i don't like those sounds. it's just not proper to play outside on halloween night. halloween is supposed to be kind of fun scary but those cries on the cd just turned me off. i recommend ""scary sounds of halloween"" on k-tel."
5,Wondeful book and author,I am 27 years old now and I first read this book when I was 18 years old.At which time I lived in a girls home.We had a banquet in honor of this author; and yes he attended.He is very respectful and very strong for sharing his story and I admire him for that.I plan to find this book again and reread it.But this book is something I will never forget.Even though I am a girl; I found it to be very interesting.It was read by alot of the staff at the girls home also.I would recommend this book to anyone who has been a victim theirself.
5,Insightful,"As the wife of an incest trauma survivor, I found this book to be very insightful, particularly in light of the fact that trauma can be buried for decades, and surface at a time when the survivors are married. Given his intellect, I really appreciated the author's ability to convey his humiliation, humility, and humanity."
3,Just the absolute basics,"For the very very basic stuff the video covers it does a good job. But I expected more on a whole DVD. It has just about 30 minutes of material just showing the absolute basics. As an example, there is very limited information on buzzing on this DVD. I found much more information on playing the trumpet on the Internet using search engines while I was waiting for the DVD to arrive. The DVD also has a few PDF files with basic music theory/sheet music reading but it is too basic and without any context to help you understand it and use it."
1,Slipped and Easily Broke,"I bought this router because I thought that Skil was a reputable brand and this tool would work well and last a while. Not only did the bit sometimes slip down while using, making the cut deeper than desired, but after not much use the motor completely died while the LEDs continued to work. I reported this to Skil assuming that they would stand by their product and have some decent customer service. Unfortunately, my assumption was wrong and all I received was a quick email saying they were sorry and recommending I take it to a service center. Needless to say, I am going to buy a router of a different brand, instead."
3,skil-1825,"I got this router a couple of months ago and at the beginning I was very happy with its performance. My only complaint started when I mounted the fixed base to my home-made router table. When routing mortises by increasing gradually the bit height I noticed that the cuts did not aligned between height adjustments. I thought that maybe the fence was not at right angle with the route table but this was not the problem. As reported here and in another forum [...]I found that the bit move out of the vertical a little when it is raised. Although you can still get an acceptable mortise a little wider (1/64""-1/32"") by using a chisel or moving the fence (when the bit is at full height), the lack of precision is my main concern.Still for the price is a good router, power is excellent, and the fixed and plunge bases look solid and well made, I have used this router in some of my projects and I am happy with the results."
3,"I would rate lower, except for the low price","This is a beginner's router. It was the first router I purchased. I now wish I would have spend 50% more and purchased a better set. It is much harder to get precision out of this tool than my Porter Cable or Bosch routers. It is just cheaper made and doesn't index as well. This set now sits in the bottom of my tool box and I am not able to find anyone willing to purchase it, so I will probably wind up giving it away. I made some decent projects and this is a fine router if you are only planning on using it very occasionally. If you get serious into woodworking, you will wish that you spent more for a better unit. It is cheapest to upgrade when you buy it. Wish I had."
4,Good stuff,"I bought this along with some Bones Reds bearings for my son. I am an engineer and I find this to be very good lubricant for the job it is intended for. However, $5 for 1/2 ounce of lube is kind of expensive. That said, when my son uses this up, I will probably buy him more. It is good stuff."
5,Quality Item,"Its great. Absolutely Great. Lives up to all the description says, the bones speed cream not only cleans out the excess dirt in the bearing, but lubes it up, protects it from wear, and makes the bearings look brand new. I would recommend for any skater"
5,Perfect bearing lube,This bearing lube is very noce and works well. I would recommend using it on your bearings and not on your nuts at all. I think this makes 20 words as requird by Amazon.
4,Better than the original,"This is the best version of Life I'd played. No betting, instead you're trying to steal from other players, battling their ships and you may even take the Black Pearl. It's just a fun game when you want to play something that doesn't take too much thought or time. It's certainly no Ticket To Ride, PowerGrid, or even Yspahan, but it's certainly enjoyable."
4,Pirates Ahoy!,Generally liked the game. The Pirate wheel was hard to spin. When youchoose captains we take the $[...] card out of the pack. To hard to winwith little chance of improving your Captain. Takes a few games to understand the rules. My nine year old daughter and I enjoy playing the game.
1,used book,Not real pleased. Didn't care if it was marked but they failed to mention that the book was full of colored marker lines from an individual who read and underlined almost every page.
2,Don't waste your time.,"This film is a waste of time. The plot was unoriginal, I was able to figure out who the killer was by half the film, and it is a mediocre rip off of Seven.Though the main actor was really good- kind of reminded me of Robert Downy Jr, and the gory parts were nice but the worst part of this movie was the end.Anyone who has seen Seven, let me say this and you will agree it's ripped off ness:A serial killer who kills with a themewho leaves clues and messages to the copsactually leaves one of those is some kinda underground sex room at a bar.Enough said."
3,Whatever... Watch the pilot.,"This polysexual soap opera is messy, over the top and has a meandering plot, much like the bad Strand-releasing B-films that go straight to video. The jumpy camera angles and hyperstylized drag queen sets make this more a watered down Gregg Araki and less funky, bohemian post-gender r-e-a-l-n-e-s-s (I don't know anyone who wears club gear at 2 in the afternoon)... That said, if you watch the pilot (called cleverly enough 'Hetrosexuality') in the special features - you actually see a bit more of the soul that the director probably intended. The editing isn't nearly as flashy, the plotlines are more credible, and the dialogue less scripted."
3,"Nice, but...","Maybe it's the fact that the dvd copy was kinda cheap, but it was hard to hear, hard to see and at times, hard to hear. I didn't enjoy it that well because of these things. From what I could follow it was a decent storyline. Wish I could have enjoyed it more. Maybe I'll just head on over the London..."
4,Strange product,"When you use this it instantly makes your lips feel moist without feeling waxy like Chapstick. If your lips are a bit cracked it gives a somewhat stinging sensation after that, but it is very mild and not really painful. Within a half hour your lips get a smooth, slippery, dry, elastic feel to them. It is really strange, your lips feel dry but aren't cracking or anything like that. And then after several hours you need to reapply it, so it doesn't last as long as waxy feeling moisturizers.It works well if you can ignore the strange feel of your lips, but lost 1 star because of how short it lasts."
2,"This class is a big waste of time, you will see","You will hate this course and book as much as I did; promise! It's required so you will take it and in the end you will say, just another busy work class that is not going to help me on Hesi or NCLEX.Who ever wrote this book eithor does not have a life or was paid a heck of a lot of money; probably both."
5,fast shipping excellent condition,i received the book quickly it was as described. no damage whatsoever book was in excellent condtion i was very pleased with my purchase
3,Good introduction,"This is a good book if you want to get a feel for Little Nemo, but not if you want to have a complete collection of the strips. The artwork is beautiful and the storyline is great, unfortunately, the editor has taken out some parts of the story, so near the end it starts to become kind of clippy, so to speak."
5,great fun,I loved this game when I was a kid and I love it now as an adult. I invite friends over for food and drink while we play this game for hours on end. Some descriptions and some guesses are hysterical and form the basis for great memories.
4,Super Fun Game,"Did not know anything about this game before purchase.It is SO FUN. You need multiple playters, but heck - that's more than half the fun.Requires some cognitive gymnastics, so not an appropriate game for a drunken group!"
2,Review,"Again, this product was a very, very old and outdated version. The cards differed from the newer version and everything. The product was in great shape, it was just very outdated. I wish there were some way to tell how old a product is so you don't think you're getting a recent version when you are not. Just a suggestion."
3,Aqua Blast,This is such a great slide. The only problem is that it popped after the first use by boys. I would guess that any of them would have popped though. Kind of disappointing.
3,a lot of fun,"Arrived when it was promised, as always. This is the biggest positive about Amazon.com. This is a lot of fun toy, but dangerous since it's too slippery (it's supposed to be, but anyway, careful). Once you hit the plastic part, you have to be sitting or be on your belly. If standing, it's asking to have a concussion and go to hospital. That said, its refreshing fun for hours."
1,"Not as described, specifically looked for a slide of 20 feet or more in length, this one is not, contrary to description!","My nephew and I spent quite a bit of time reviewing all of the various options on amazon looking for a 20 foot or longer slip n slide type product, purchased this one because it said it was over 20 feet long in the description, arrived today and box says it is only 15 ft long!Never had to return anything on Amazon before but I certainly hope they don't charge me to return it, since it was so falsely advertised.Very disappointing, not enough time to order another to arrive here before the weekend party that it was for, Toys R us here I come!"
4,I saw savings,"ASIN: B0000C6DY7 Very good pair of tungsten carbide tipped blades at a price that is more reasonable than anything I could find for a similiar product. Skil is not considered to be the premier tool and accessory supplier, but unless you are doing commercial woodworking, it is a dependable and easy to find source of homeowner products for the do-it-yourself crowd. I know, I are one. (Well maybe not a crowd.)"
4,Memphis Hip Shake,"Hailing from Memphis, TN, Roxy Blue took the Hollywood hair metal sound and injected it with a healthy dose of Southern rock swagger. The band has as much gloss and polish as the average L.A band but with a barroom rocking attitude. Think Poison or Warrant meets Junkyard meets a case of Jack Daniels!Released in 1992, Want Some was the band's debut (and only) studio album. It features 12 rocking songs, including a cover of the Who's ""Squeeze Box."" I'm not sure why hair metal bands keep picking that song, but Roxy Blue's version is fun enough. Warrant's Jani Lane and Survivor's Jimi Jamison both make guest appearances providing background vocals for this album.It may not be very original, but Roxy Blue's music is still plenty of fun. It would have been nice if they had managed to serve up another album, but it was not meant to be."
3,Another Sleazy Band,"This band come from Memphis,but not sound like ELVIS,it sounds like many bands from the 90's but it's a good band,party & ballads, well done"
5,The only way to eat turkey,"My uncle cooked Xmas turkey on one of these. Turkey is usually pretty dry (to me, at least), but this was fantastic. Best turkey I've ever had, literally melt-in-your-mouth juicy."
1,You get what you pay for,"I assumed that such a simple device would work fine; it only cost a couple of bucks, but I can't even use it as it is poorly made and distorts the signal enough to knock me offline. I think whoever sold this got some factory rejects, as Belkin products are usually effective."
4,A very enjoyable read.,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book, I have read a lot of books on India but this one is different, hard to say how much is fiction and what is real, but it is very well written, nothing confusing about it. I hope Leslie Forbes writes more of similar theme."
4,Great watch at reasonable price,Thats a great watch at a very reasonable price. I just love the make of the watch. I wanted to buy it the moment I saw it on Amazon.Its a great buy.
3,OK movie,"The movie was cute, but I was expecting better. I watched it once with my daughter and it hasn't been watched since :( Maybe worth seeing once, but don't buy it."
4,We will watch it every year,"So funny and fun to watch, it will be a tradition for us. The characters are hilarious and very appropriate for my 8 year old son."
5,Cute Kids Movie,"I have yet to see it, but sent for Christmas to grandkids and they love it. They can't get enough of it so it must be good. Right up there with Toy Story for ""I want to see...again."" Will wait till I visit to view myself."
5,HOP,"The cutest Easter movie ever for not telling the story of Christ that is. The kids love it and I love it. The fact that Cody Simpson sings, ""I love candy"" helps out."
3,Different Concept.,"It was a movie which I just could not get into. It was an enjoyable movie over all but not very memorable,"
3,It does have a Digital Copy!,"I only got it because it included a digital copy - well thats what Amazon says. I got the blu-ray today and theres nothing on the package that says Digital Copy, but it does say ""Ultra Violet"" on it which pissed me off. (I cant tell you how much i hate Ultra Violet) Well I was about to put it back in the box to return it, when I looked up the website on the box and it states it has itunes digital copy, so i open it up and YES it does have a digital copy via itunes!!!! score!"
1,One of worst movies of all time,"If my husband and I could give negative stars we would. Very slow, thin story line, over acting, bad acting. We usually like children's movies, but this was just plain awful."
3,Good but HUGE.,"I bought these and took them daily for a week. They work good surpressing the hunger and even for a couple days after discontinuing use. They are, however, too big. I can barely swallow them and cutting them doesn't help. I would also not recommend keeping them near your face/in your mouth as they smell and taste horrible(kind of like dog food)"
4,very pleased,I received the order on time and it was packaged very well and the product work the way that I was told it would.Very pleased
5,You love Sondheim? You'll love this DVD.,"I never tire of the music and the renditions on this DVD are wonderful. This is one of the DVDs I want on my desert island, the one with an electrical outlet."
4,FOX PUT IT DOWN,JAMIE PUT IT DOWN IN THIS MOVIEABOUT THE MAN WHO STARTED THE CRIPS GANGTHE MOVIE IS ABOUT THE FOUNDER OF THECRIPS WHO IS PUT ON DEATH ROWFOR MURDER. HE NOW WOULD LIKE TO PUTA END TO ALL GANG BANGING IN LA BETWEENTHE BLOODS AND THE CRIPS HE GOES THREW AHARD TIME AND HAS LONG WAY TO GO TO GETHIS VOICE HEARD BUT HE KEEPS FOCUSTHIS IS A MUST OWN DVD
5,FIVE STAR Review!,"Why? Because this movie tells it how it truely is & was & unfortunately,what it shall be for many generations to come. Our kids,teens & young adults NEED to be able to watch something that for so many of us hits home.YOU CAN CHANGE NO MATTER WHAT CIRCUMSTANCES FACE YOU."
5,great movie,This is great movie. It can be watched over and over again. You can allow your children/grandchildren to watch also.
4,Soft Form hernia belt,"The hernia belt made by Soft Form fits very well and isa quality product. I highly recommend it. Thank to its velcrocoating,it will not come loose."
2,too bulky,"IMO, this hernia belt is too bulky. I've used another white colored belt that is much less bulky. Therefore I didn't like this one. Tried to return it, but was told by the seller that I'll have to order something else instead. Had to file an Amazon claim to get my money back."
5,The Snow Queen,This is an amazing book! The story is wonderful and the illustrations are gorgeous- full of living art and beauty. My first grade class enjoyed hearing it throughout the week. The story is about friendship and never giving up on helping those close to you no matter how hopeless a situation may look.
5,A Balanced Conversation,"Chat with God keeps it simple and more importantly balanced. This tool helps readers to be a bit more intentional about prayer. Rather than offering a series of requests and pleas, readers are coached to contemplate God's nature, express thankfulness, and offer confession as well. Use daily, weekly, seldom or frequently. My experience is that it leads to more consistant and more balanced communication with God."
5,Remembering how it felt to be in the Sierra's,"This recording, in particular the Range of Light portion, takes me back over forty years to when we as a family back-packed in the Sierra's. It was a time when seeing one orange peel on the trail was the only time there was evidence of other humans in the vicinity. Muir's soulful poetry comes from a deep place only found, I believe, in deep solitude. Catherin Robbin's singing was a perfect match to the expressive music by Sasha Matson and painted the tones appropriate to the scenes evoked. It's a unique recording."
3,Hard To Handle,"The scanning feature is a nuisance, as it won't stay on one station very long.The instruction booklet is not helpful at all, and neither is the description of how the radio works on Amazon.The sound's not bad, if you can stand the frequent switching of stations.I recommend getting another small radio for walking or jogging, even if it's more expensive."
1,It's a waste of money.,"I bought this at a sports shop for about $9. I then took it cross country skiing, so not a very rigorous activity. The radio couldn't stay on one station - rather, it would switch from station to station on its own, even ones that were just static. It does not do what it's supposed to."
5,Love Blue Bloods!,Excellent TV series! Great to go back and see the beginning. Wish all TV had writing of this quality. Great!
5,Blue Bloods,I loved it. Would recomend it to anyone who likes easy to watch programs. Its' s page turner!Blue Bloods.season 1
1,Blue Bloods,I bought it for a Christmas presen fort my friend. She loves Blue Bloods but always falls asleep before it is over.
5,THE BEST!!!,"I have always been into ""Law and Order"" type shows.. This is by far the BEST show that is on and I can't wait for Season 2. Donnie Wahlberg is an amazing actor and has come far to get where he's at. Tom Selleck is a seasoned actor and still got it going on. Wil Estes is wonderful as are the other cast members!! Hope CBS keeps this going as long as WE keep wanting it!!"
5,Blue Bloods is excellent TV viewing!,"From the moment I saw the previews of Blue Bloods...before it aired...I was hooked! Tom Selleck, Donnie Wahlberg, Bridget Moynahan, Jennifer Esposito...WOW! I was so happy to see Tom Selleck back on TV! And once I watched it there was no turning back! I love the basis of the storyline, the family dinners. I remember Amy Carlson from Third Watch...one of the other best shows ever on television! Blue Bloods is saved on my DVR!"
2,Not what I expected !,"I had hoped to see more of Kubiak's sketches & especially color paintings.Published in 1970, this book is politically incorrect & some terms are offensive to a Native American. Not enough info in the written parts of the book, but most of the tribes have long disappeared !"
3,McCulloch Leaf Blower/Vacuum,"I've only used the equipment once since I bought it. I found it to be heavier than a previous McCulloch Leaf Blower I used to own but found that this one is more powerful. The assembly of the vacuum bag and plastic chute takes some getting used to and wearing the bag and strap is somewhat uncomfortable. I did manage to vacuum (quite well) a rather large area before the bag became almost full and the weight made it necessary to empty. Emptying the bag was easy but messy. The rotating impeller is plastic and I don't know how long it will last since twigs and small rocks are ingested and can wear down the plastic. Time will tell.The blower portion is powerful as stated before. The equipment is easily handled but it is a bit heavier than I would have liked. Overall, I think I'll be satisfied with this blower/vac."
4,next best thing to being there,"""Sierra Club 2004 Wilderness Wall Calendar""A bestseller for thirty years - over 7 million sold.All the grandeur of the North American wilderness.Gift-boxed.In order to view 12 thumbnail images, go to this page:sierraclub.org/books/calendars/This exquisite wall calendar rates 4 stars rather than 5because the paper utilized in its production is neitherTotally Chlorine Free (TCF) (ie, produced w/o chlorine norwith any chlorinated bleaching compound) (H2O2 is OK), nor50% (or more) ""Post-consumer reclaimed waste"" (that is,reclaimed paper-fiber that has served its end purpose)."
5,Excellent near-primary source,"The benefit of this volume is that it was written shortly after the death of the great General. Being able to read the words of people who actually knew him provides a two edged sword. On one hand the recollections create an opportunity for first hand knowledge, but they also provide an opportunity for hero worship as well. Modern technology and the ability to analyze more data might create a more thourough picture of General Hancock, but it does not provide as clear a view as seeing how he was viewed by his peers."
5,DO YOU HAVE DREMEL TOOLS???,"if you have any dremel tool , well youll have to have the proper accesories..."
2,150 tools,"the number of tools, 150, is misleading. Many of the ""tools"" were simply tiny abrasive disks. These are not tools. Customer cannot tell this from the pictures. I suggest that you make distinction between tools and abrasive disks."
4,Hard to find book,"Was very pleased to find this book. It was part of my forefathers background and I wanted to see exactly what happened. It was the good ones, not the ""bad"" one, Frank Glazier."
5,A Must for Children Whose Parents Have to be Away,"Magic for children who miss their travelling parents!At last a book that reaches out to children facing issues of parental separation of any kind!I am a professional child-care provider and the mother of a four-year old. Some of the children that I read this book to have parents that are gone for weeks or days. For others, the parents are just out for the evening. But all the children who hear this book, including my son, identify with Casey and Whittnie and are comforted by the story. They are also captivated by the illustrations and are inspired to make magic boxes of their own.Parents and teaches will find the ""Notes to Parents"" at the end of the book very helpful.This book is a must for every home and school library. Definitely five stars.Kimberly Thayer"
5,Awesome CD by Trace Adkins,"I have counted down the days until this CD was available. I rushed right out and purchased it. I am a big fan of Trace's and have every CD that he had made. This one is, by far, the best one yet. He is a very talented performer and I just love to watch him dance. I have to say that all songs on this CD have become my favorite."
5,Trace IS Coming' On Strong,"Sandwiched between 2 songs that get the women thinking about being ""Hot Mama""'s and their men being ""Rough & Ready"" are 9 other songs that make TRACE ADKINS just what you see. Someone that is not afraid to sing about heartache, pain, loss and yes, indeed, lasting love--and in a way that makes you remember your own first time, your first loss of love and finding it again!!! Thanks Trace Adkins for giving us your best selection of music yet!!! If you are looking for a lot of meat on your sandwich, you will definitely be full when you are through listening to this great cd."
4,Great product,I mounted my Hi-Lift in a roof basket by adapting this kit on some metal plates. Works fine and gives nice support to the Hi-Lift. I think you won't regret it if you get one of this.
3,GOOD GRIEF - I MUST HAVE SEEN THE WRONG MOVIE!,"I will admit that I bought it for Sam Elliott -- but what a disappointment.He is great in the character that he portrays, Bill Speakes, a Marshall? He is apparently blinded to the true character of his son.Sarah O'Rourke, was she married to the Marshall's son? Hot Diggity to the black eyes given to the character on the stage who bullies his wife.Jack Cooper was a plausible con-man - Did he and she come out of the shoot-out alive?With Cooper looking out for his brother and generally acting honorable to Sarah, he came out almost decent in character.Could have done without the poor gal who did the bare top scene - nothing alluring there!Not one of the better westerns that I have seen. And I know that Sam Elliott has done better. [I hope]Ah well, don't waste your money on the DVD -- no extras, no intel on the actors and their characters.See it if you must!"
1,They don't make them any worse than this,Awful. I've lost about 95% of my respect for Sam Elliott. And I don't appreciate the gratuitous nudity. I almost made the mistake of watching this with my kids. What a piece of junk.
4,Very decent camera for a very decent price,"You get what you pay for and more... For a camera that is normally under 300 bucks, one can not really complain. If you expecting it to perform like a 2000 dollar camera then don't buy it. If you are looking for something simple to use (for me it was for the birth of my son etc...) It was perfect. Get another battery, an SD card for pictures, and a few DV cassettes and you are good to go. Amazon sells it for a bit high, I would go to Dell and purchase it with a few coupons, normally ends up to be like 240-270 free shipping + your local taxes, so under 300."
1,31AE6GLF701 8.5HP 26-Inch 2-Stage Snow,This machine failed to provide what the manufacturer promissed.The elctrical motor which controls the position of the chute burnes out within few months. The manufacturer knows about the problem yet it continues to sell the snow thrower with it. Instead of reimbursing or recalling all the model the manufacturer simply wants you to buy a concersion kit for $55.00. The conversion kit is far more complicated to install than they want you to think. The customer support is teriible. Do yourself a favor .. do not buy this machine.
5,Summer Love,"This is one of my favorite books. I have read it over and over and each time I like it even more. Caryn and Logan's romance was a wonderful love story.Caryn first marriage left her with hidden scars and she did not want to open up to Logan for fear of repeating heartaches. Logan also had a rough time in the love department. But the love and passion that they shared was truly special.If you have not read this book, please do you will not be disappointed."
1,Terrible Product,"Many reasons why this product is terrible in order of usage:1) The dispenser cap does not work. You can't pull each piece through the cap because it it too tight and it does not load up the next one like it should so you end up popping off the entire top.2) They are not damp enough to wipe even a single small laptop screen.3) They leave behind the worst streak marks you could imagine. Honesly, you are better off never having wiped your screen with these. It will probably be worse after you wipe than before.Do not buy."
2,Probably would not purchase again,"They aren't damp enough, and they are hard to dispense. But once you get a few out they do the job."
5,A Snapshot in Time,"We got our first memory book as a gift for my oldest daughter, now in 4th grade. I thought it was such a great and quick way to document the precious moments(for those of us who don't have the time or resources to dedicate to scrapbooking). I have purchased one for each of my younger two daughters.This book features pockets to store awards and favorite pictures for each grade. I am sure they will enjoy looking back on these memories in the years to come."
3,School Days Book,"I was a little disappointed when I received the book and it only had space for school pictures up to 8th grade on the cover. I didn't want to unwrap it to see if it had anything for grades over 8, but I do not believe it did."
2,Not at all believable,"I can't recommend this book. The dialogue is almost laughable and the events in the plot are just too convenient. Events as the author explains would never happen that smoothly. I couldn't even finish it, as I couldn't get involved in the story. Sad, because the idea is fascinating."
3,Conagher,"I've liked this movie's storyline ever since first seeing it on television several years ago. A couple years later I found a ""previously viewed"" VHS copy at a local video store but was disapointed in the image quality. I chalked it up as the tape being worn out. When I saw the DVD was available I quickly purchased it, certain the image quality would be there. However I was again disapointed. I recomend the story to anyone who loves Westerns. It's wonderful and its stars bring a lot to the production. Just don't expect first rate image quality."
4,Conagher,"Conagher is a good Sunday afternoon movie for the family. About a family moving out west to start a cattle homestead, the father goes off to buy cattle and dies before he gets to town. The wife carries on the place with his 2 children and to make some money cooks for the stage that goes by their farm. There is some violence as most westerns have. Sam Elliot plays the main character, a cowhand who falls in love with the Mrs., in this western love story."
3,.001 not .0001,Solidly built and usable - but the small scale doesn't do anything. This unit measures to .001 not .0001 - unless I'm missing something.
5,The VERY best,My mother used this back in the 30's & 40's when she was a nurse and I've used it for about 45 years. Because it's so difficult to find I've tried others but NOTHING compares. This is the best hand creme there is and I will do anything to find it!
3,OK,The pant's were nice but for me they did not fit the size was a little off but the product was good.
4,Paul Klee,"I was not a fan of this artist until I saw his work in a museum. It was there that I discovered a unique array of creativity and imagination that brought about colors, lines, forms, music and rhythm all within a painting.This book gave a brief yet descriptive history about one of the less talked abstract artists in history. His eclectic painting techniques and style grasped the attention of many different spectators.I enjoyed reading and sharing this book to others, especially kids. The book opened the eyes of students who found it difficult to find their inner creativity. The book also talks about how music and rhythm are incorporated into his abstract and colorful paintings."
4,Skythoi Warriors,"Most are under the impression that the Scythian army consisted exclusively of lightly clad horsemen (or women) shooting arrows in the typical 'Parthian Shot', but this book reveals their true versitality in war-they used all weapons, swords, axes, spears, daggers, shields, and so on in addition to the bows that would later be characteristic of the Parthians, Turks, and Mongols. The plates are good, and depict the Scytho-Sarmatian warrior-women, the inspiration for the myth of the 'Amazons', in addition to Scythian warriors triumphing over Thracian and Macedonian foes. As always, this men-at-arms book is an excellent introduction to the weapons, tactics, and general history of its subject."
2,Take you're chances buying online,"The bass has super high action to the point of making it difficult to play. I have 2 fender basses that were setup ready to play out of the box no issues. This bass came with an a string that buzzes. Not because of the setup but because its a faulty string. Its a shame because I like the idea of the bass for travel. Everything else does work ok but the with the high action and faulty string, it makes you think twice about buying online. The high action I can almost forgive but the bad string shouldn't have slipped by."
2,Dont care for the analog knob,"Product description's ""easy-to-adjust tuning mechanism"" is anything but. It is extremely difficult to set the tuner on the correct station. I couldnt recieve a single AM station with this portable radio. The detachable belt clip has a habit of detaching at its leisure. The price is cheap, but so is the product."
5,The Indie Bible rocks....an amazing data base!,"Just wanted to tell you that the Indie Bible rocks....an amazing data base. I was the songwriter/ guitarist for the million selling MCA band, TRIXTER. Now that I'm reinventing myself w/ 40FT. RINGO, I'm using all the weapons necessary to conquer. This book is definitely part of the arsenal!"
5,Oracle Press better than Sybex for Performance Tuning,"I bought the Sybex book. One of my colleagues bought this Oracle Press book. I read both and passed the test with plenty to spare. For the Oracle9i Performance Tuning Exam, I strongly recommend Oracle Press over Sybex. If you are buying just one, get the Oracle Press book. In particular, the Oracle Press sample tests and CD-ROM tests are much closer to the actual exam than Sybex."
4,Voice improvement book,"As a speech coach I really like this book to give to my clients for basic speech improvements. The best features of the book are it's easy-to-read layout, the ""12 minute vocal workout"" and the audio CD. The drawbacks are that the CD has only short models to imitate for practice and the book does not reference the CD sections clearly."
1,"Vinyl in the names, but it is a CD","The name has [Vinyl] in description, but it was a CD.oh well, at least at was really cheap, so It wasn't a huge loss..."
3,trivial pursuit:Totally 80s,Not what I expected. My 20 something kids were excited to play but unfortunately the game is geared toward the 50 or 60 somethings. We did very poorly getting any correct answers.
2,Not what I expected,"From the outside of the box I assumed it was going to be an 80s pop culture trivia. I tried to play it with 3 other people (all of which were children in the eighties) and the questions were very hard. I think if you were an adult in the 80s this is perfect, but if you grew up at that time this is not for you."
3,Totally 80's Kind of Bunk,"This game is fun the first time played but if you go through a lot of the questions (only 1 box), the next time around answers are remembered. The Historical questions are good, the TV ones great for me but a lot from the same types of shows (Dallas, Knots Landing, etc.), and all in all a good time for laughs and memories but not much more. Oh Yeah, and the music questions have some artists categorized wrong...Cindi Lauper as Hard Rock?? Come on!"
1,This game just isnt fun.... nothing like the original Trivial Pursuit,I purchased this game because our original Trivial Pursuit game is very worn and we have memorized most of the questions and answers. Our tradition of our children coming home for the holidays and playing board games in the evening was not much fun with this game. It seemed most of the questions were boring and uninteresting. I do not reccomend this game to anyone.....
2,poorly made and tacky plant stand.,"This plant stand is very poorly made and pretty tacky. It's very weak and unsteady and does not measure up to the advertising. Had I paid more than $18 for it I'd be angry, but what did I expect for that. Like my Mother always told me, ""ya get just what ya pay for"". Shame on me, looking for a bargain. Don't waste your $18 on this one."
3,"Convenient, easy, but not long lasting","Totally agree with others that this makes cleaning the toilet a lot easier, that the brush works well, and that there is really no mess to deal with once done.However, now that we have used these for a couple months, we can say that the 'clean' does not last as long as the old liquid and toilet scrub brush method does. In every toilet we have noticed that the waterline film comes back within just a few days, and that other yucky growth begins to creep up the sides shortly thereafter. The liquid and toilet brush method kept the toilet clean looking for at least a full week, if not closer to two... but these do not.Nice and easy, but expensive since we have to clean so much more often and buy so much more product. Recommend for a touch up when guests are visiting, but not for use as the only product to clean toilets."
5,Love this book! Tons of info!,As a professional picture framer this book is invaluable. It has every kind of photograph that I have ever heard of and then some. I am sure I will be able to handle and frame any photograph that crosses my counter. This book is a real find!
3,Useful for inexperienced workers,"While this book is useful to those who are new to the field or those who rigidly practice one approach to addictions counselling it is not helpful for experienced workers. The authors explore some really basic material (cycle of change, motivational interviewing, etc) and claim that this is somehow new. The overall approach (client centered) is useful but lacks depth."
1,not what shown,"Ordered and got wrong one, 2nd and 3rd replacements were an off white/yellow color. They said there were going to pull off their site. If you have all real white decor, this won't work."
5,perfect,I bought this for my teenage son. It is a perfect weight for his warm-blooded little self. He likes it. ;)
5,60 Minutes - I'm Mike Wallace - A 60 MINUT...,I missed this when it was aired on 60 minutes so I got this to see another great story of a good man.
3,Interesting trip back,I had forgotten about this case. An interesting read based on an actual case. Authour seemed to have taken extra liberties in connection with conversations that had supposedly taken place.
1,If loving you is wrong,This book was not well written. The information jumped from topic to topic. What little information there was was repeated over and over. It seemed as if a newspaper article was stretched out to fill a book.
2,Hard to keep my interest,Because I paid to read this I tried to finish but couldn't do it. Book was based on a lot of hearsay and events were in random order.
4,Excellent well researched book - If loving you is wrong,"I thought this was an excellently well written book by Mr Olsen. I am a reader from United Kingdom and have read a previous book An American Black Widow which was brilliant. Luckily I can now get true crime books from Amazon as there is not a great deal of choice in the U.K and US has some exceptionally good authors of true crime books.This is the sad story of Mary Kay Letourneau a teacher who fell in love with a student, albeit he was only 12 years old at the time! And had two children to him. I certainly do not see Vili as a victim.I hope Mr Olsen keeps his true crime books coming out thick and fast."
1,"Only one out there, but you don't need it","Like others who have reviewed this book, I bought it because it's the only one out there. The other books are just practice tests. This book alone did not adequately prepare me for the biochem subject test. What it did do is provide a guideline to things I needed to review in depth using my own text books from college. Also, the practice test in the back of the books was far easier than the practice tests from the GRE website, which were more in line with the real test. I would not purchase it again. Rather, just use the info provided by the GRE website to guide you and rely on your text books and lecture notes for review."
1,Will waste your time,I have only read the first five pages and it has obvious critical errors. I will have to abandon it for fear of learning more mis-information.This book has probably never been edited by a scientist.<<<<DOON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY>>>>> Unless you want to buy my copy.
1,Horrible.,"Definitely not worth the money, or anything for that matter. Not only does the book have typos, but the information is incorrect. Everything is summarized (and not very well at that!), and ""old school"" terms are used. Remember: it's cheap for a reason!"
1,dangerous defect,"The saw worked very well. Hoewever, the second time I used it the saftey button failed to return to to off position. the result was that when i picked up the saw by the handle it started. Fortunately, the blade was not in contact with my leg but sure scared the hell out of me. I am returning the product and recommend you look elsewhere"
4,Great tongs,The tongs work very well. The locking mechanism works but easily becomes unlocked if the tongs get moved around in the drawer. That hasn't really been a problem for me.
1,A ripoff,You have done a good job concealing the fact that this book is in Italian. Now I find you don't accept returns. I have spent $25 and what can we do with a computer book we can't read. You are a ripoff outfit. Phoebe Sharp
1,5200+ Great Games,"I love playing games on the computer, so thought I would find a few of my favorites on this cd. The problem is you have to load ""ALL"" of the games. You can't pick and choose. Since I don't want to fill up my hard drive, I just decided to put it away. I won't be using it."
1,dremel had to be returned to manufacturer,The dremel bit did not fit (no I am not a poet!) no matter what we tried. We had to pay for it to be returned to the manufacturer for the proper fittings.
4,Works great but eats batteries,"This is great product. It has made trimming our Greyhound's nails a brezee. By the second time I used it on him, he went to his bed and just let me trim as much as I needed. I like the price and that it is cordless. My only complaint is how quickly it goes through batteries. Make sure you get the big packages of batteries."
3,average,"the product overall worked okay.. it is sent in a blister pack, and it didnt look totally closed. the pictured wrench was not included in the package. after i first used it the HIGH speed stopped working, and it would only work on low. looking inside the unit i noticed a bent pin. i used a small screwdriver to bend the pin back to where i thought it belongs, and the high speed started to work again."
4,good quality product,"I have 6 pups so I have to do as much grooming myself as I can. I am petrified of all the different nail clippers I have bought. But this tool makes me feel more confident that I am not going to hurt them. One thing to note, it sucks up the batteries so I bought rechargable ones!"
1,"worthless to me,, others might like it","I purchased the Dremel Pet Nail Grooming tool because it was rated as better than the pedi-paws. I guess it's not for just any dog, because my dog is petrified of the thing. She already doesn't like her feet being held to trim her nails, but the raucous noise of this thing scares the poop out of her and she runs and hides. I tried what another person suggested, turning it on and letting it run to get her used to it, but she just freaks out. I'm going to give it to my sister because her dog is older and partially deaf and has a more stable personality."
3,Good..but get the Dremel 750-02 Minimite instead!!!!!!!!!!,"This product is good, but buy the Dremel 750-02 Minimite instead. Almost the same thing, but it has it's own rechargable battery and charger!! RNot marketed for dogs..but same power. Read the reviews. It really is awesome.Please do not waste your money on the peticure or pedipaws. They are junk and way over priced because they are marketed for pets."
3,Dremel Pet Rotary Tool,"Rec'd product from Amazon quickly and in good order, as usual from them. Product looks sturdy enough, tho I haven't had a chance to use it on my dog yet. Will reserve my review until then."
2,It will fall apart!,"There is no question that dremeling a dogs nails is safer, more comfortable and easier to use. I cut my dog's quick once and I felt just terrible. Have said that, this particular product falls apart. It literally fell apart in my hand. It eats batteries and it doesn't keep a consistant speed. I have stepped up to a cordless rotary tool with a battery charger. There is a really good article on dremeling a dogs nails [...] Read it before you buy a dremel and use it. There is a real art to it and if you love your dog, you want them comfortable and safe."
2,Nada for dog nails,"Tried this for my dogs' nails, and just wasn't powerful enough. I returned it to Lowe's for a refund, and have now ordered the Minimite from Amazon.com."
1,Pay the extra and Upgrade,"After researching all the Dremel's available, I chose this handy, easy to use model. My intention was to use this tool for the sole purpose of trimming nails for my two small dogs. It was Ok at first blush. The file did not last through the first dog, had to switch out to a new one. The second time I reached for the tool to use it, it would not work...Changed the batteries, no luck. It's dead in the water. Upgraded to a multi-speed with a cord (personal preference). So far, so good."
4,Dremel Cordless Pet Nail Groomer,"I bought this tool to 'grind' my papillon's nails. It works well although the two different speed controls dont seem to operate optimally. It makes keeping her nails short a breeze, it is quick and painless for us both. However I cannot get it near my other dog's feet, he snaps and snarls at the mere sound of the Dremel. It is great if your dog is compliant or you can train a puppy to get used to it. In essence the tool is great."
3,Step up and you'll be happier,"I have Dremeled my dog's nails since he was a pup and there is no better way to do it. However, this item is cheap and weak and runs through batteries. Just do yourself a favor a get a Dremel that will do the job well in the first place. It costs a bit more, but is well worth it in reliability and saved aggravation. The one you want is theDremel MultiPro Cordless 7700-02. (You don't need the 50 accessories that come with it for your dog's nails, but I've only seen it sold that way and that's how it's sold on Amazon.)The two keys here are that it is a 7.2V Dremel so it is much stronger and better suited for large dogs, and it comes with a rechargeable battery pack so you don't have to replace batteries. Plus, you'll have a real Dremel around the house and you will definitely find other uses for it once you have it. Although the MultiPro may be more expensive initially, you will save money in the long run. Trust me, you'll thank yourself for getting the better tool."
1,"Loud, little value for the money","Plastic version of the well built dremel tool. However, this one is not built at all like the dremel. In addition, 4 AAA required batteries are not included. The accessories are just 5 duplicate standard sanding disks. I also purchase the Pedi - Paws"", which is very similar to the Dremel pet tool in design. It is slightly quieter and appears to be better built. If you really want to try one out, pick the Pedi-Paws. Our cat is interested in neither, so both products sit on the shelf."
2,Sounds like a good idea,bought to do pets nails -- not as easy as states. Tool gets hot against nail too quick. Goes thru batteries way to fast.
1,Not really worth it,[...]This one is very weak and I was only trying to use it on a Pug. The bits that came with it all ran out really fast. The tool itself feels real cheap compared to the other dremel I have. It would be much better to get a real Dremel since this one is the same thing but way weaker. Not really worth it. I do NOT recommended it!
4,pretty good,I think it works pretty good for the price. It does what I need it to and beats cutting nails and hurting my dog. This way it is painless and the results are much better.
4,Easy solution,"I ordered this a few months ago. My dog had no problem letting me file them with this tool. In fact, he tries to lick the machine. It works perfectly, but I do wish it was rechargeable. My mom's dog also let me groom her nails without any problems. Would buy again and again."
5,Great Nail File,"Item is used by my dogs vet and I decided to get one also for in between visits. Works great and is far better then clippers and a file to shorten and smooth mytoy poodles nails, and no worry of cutting nail too short and cause bleeding. Highly recommend"
1,NOT WORTH THE MONEY cheap plastic poor design,"For a cheap plastic, badly designed, made in Mexico piece of junk, it's not half bad. It's very under powered and I don't think the switch will last very long. The batteries are hard to replace. If you have a big dog you will need a lot of batteries. I'm going to give mine away and buy a standard Dremel off eBay at not much more than I paid for this cheap junk.The wrench is NOT in the package."
3,Doesn't seem to work very well.,"I wasn't terribly impressed with this product. I have medium sized dogs and it didn't seem to do much to trim their nails. I also wasn't happy with the amount of noise it makes or how quickly the nail heats up. I know you're supposed to alternate between toes to avoid heat build up, but that just gets frustrating when working with a dog who's already freaked out by the high-pitched whining noise. Also, I feel like it would benefit from a guard around the bit, similar to other products out there."
4,Pet Dremel,"I Love It! My Twelve year old golden retriever won't let anyone trim his nails and he doesn't mind the dremel at all, which is a miracle! The directions for introducing your pet to the dremel is the most critical component to making this process a success. Without that advice, it would not have worked out at all. So for those of you (and me!) that don't like to read directions, take the time, they are short and absolutely necessary. This is a great product. The first one I received was defective, so I was a bit skeptical, but the second one was great."
3,UGH,"I did a great deal of researching before buying this product. I have sat with my dogs for a long time to try and get them use to this drill. However, I have large dogs with tough toenails. This drill doesn't go fast enough to take off any toenail. My dogs will tolerate for a while, but you have to sit there forever to get some toenail sanded off. They are only patient for so long. I only gave it a 3 because maybe I can use on some crafts that I have. I was very sadden to see that it did not perform up to my expectations."
4,"no news...""history"" well told","The all-too-familiar story of dizzying internet stock proces is told in an entertaining and reasonably sound manner. Though the book fails to bring to light anything new, it does provide an excellent summary of the events that led to the technological development, and the financial aspect of the 90's stock frenzy. While reading this book, we should keep in mind that predicting the past is not exactly difficult thing to do.Barring from a few embarrasing typos, the book is well presented and definetly deserves to be read..provides some good reference materials also in case anyone is interested to check up where the author brings his quotes or figures. Generally, a pleasurable reading experience and may learn a new ""anecdote"" or two about the Internet boom and gloom."
1,Closing the barn door long after the horse has left,"Dot-Com 'exposes' that are released two years after the boom crested are of questionable value. The subject has already been done many times, often better, by Internet Bubble, Morganstern's columns in the NY Times, others. Too little, much too late."
3,The Tech Boom from 50 years ago to Today!!!,"I bought both this and Dot.Bomb, the story of Value America.com. They were both good reads and work well together. Reading Dot.Bomb, it was like reading a piece of fiction it's so hard to believe some of what was in the book was true, let along all of it. Dot.Con is a much more anaylitical overview of the period, starting from the beginning over 50 years ago. Both were good and I recommend read in conjuction with each other."
3,need a fact-checker,"Good review of Internet bubble and crash. A few factual errors though on non-US events, ie. Thai baht was devalued July 1997, NOT 1996."
5,"A great introduction for patients, family, and friends","This is a book I have lent to several people to introduce them to the complex world of dissociative identity disorder, (formerly called multiple personality disorder). Those who have read it have come to a sound, positive understanding of the disorder. Through its gentle treatment of the topic, the fears of others have been allayed and I have been able to show others my true selves. The book is an easy, fast read, written for the general public. I'm sad to find that the book is out-of-print; it has been a great resource!"
5,mi planta de naranja lima,"tremendo libro, super bueno, recuerdo que las lagrimas se me salian cuand zeze llego tarde a la reparticion de jugetes"
5,Excelente,"Las veces que he leido este libro es inumerable. Encuentro la historia como una con la que muchos en ciertos pasajes del libro se pueden identificar con el personaje. Tiene un poco de todo lo cual hace la historia interesante. llena de picardia, ilusion sentimiento. Perdi mi copia del libro y ahora que mi hijo empieza la escuela, me gustaria que sea parte de su coleccion."
4,Yahzee Wild,"I ordered the game. It arrived in great time. The touch screen takes a little time to get used to, but well worth the time. This game can be enjoyed by kids of all ages."
5,durable and fun,"I am mid-30's and I love it, my 9yo ""steals"" it to play it, my 2yo grabs it when she can and pushes any and all buttons. I have had it for 2 years, changed the batteries 1x. It has survived falls and drops (usually on carpet), it has travelled many places and provided entertainment. Nice size, screen works well, options for classic or wild play, and you can turn the sound on or off (my husband hates the sound on, I don't mind it) and the unit automatically turns off after a couple of minutes, but is exactly where you left off in the game when you turn it back on."
1,waste of time,Not at all what I expected. The very few illustrations that they have have absolutely nothing to do with the text. This book applies to dating and meeting a wife for someone in the mideast area from a timeframe of 100 years ago.
2,"Fun toy, but prone to breaking","Got this toy for my kids (age 10) for the holidays. Went out to play with it, they had a good time while it worked, but after about 5 minutes, it kept shutting off whenever it was thrown. Returning it for a refund."
2,way to tight,Bought this for my Beretta Px4 9mm. It works but only if I don't push the mags to far into the pouch. Have not had an issue with them falling out but they are nearly impossible to remove if pushed all the way in. I have looked at the pouch and can't see a way to make it fit better. All in all I will be looking for something else and this may be the last time I buy fobus and try to save money on something like this.
1,the drippin saw,"Never got to use the saw, it leaked all the oil out within 5 minutes while laying on the counter. Had it ""repaired"" by the mfg and surprise, the same problem is still there. The repair took 2 weeks, and I think if you turn it on all the oil would be slung on your pants. Would not recommend"
3,Modem cable,"I thought this modem cable will work to connect my Uverse Gatewayrouter to the network outlet on the wall. No joy, the gateway boxwouldn't lock up to the network signal. I used a regular phone linecable and it worked fine."
1,keyless chuck,"I have purchased a number of two-pack Makita driver kits for gifts and for my own use. These have the quick-connect to hold the various drill bits & sockets. I purchased the keyless chuck that fits the quick-connect of the driver so I could use standard bits of various sizes. Well, once I opened this chuck all the way to insert a large drill bit, the teeth stuck open... I banged on it the first few times and it broke loose... Stuck for good now. Can't return it as the short warranty is over......... good concept, guess I'll check the local hardware stores to get one that works."
2,Easier to cary another tool,I would rather carry around a cordless drill along with an impact driver than use this chuck on the impact driver. The unit itself is solid and feels sturdy however it often locks up and with a little use and age is already rusting. Take my advice do not waste your money on this and put it towards more tools
2,Disappointed,The songs are good but they have too many words in them for small children to remember. I think the child's age range for this product should be age eight and above.Grace and Mercy
2,Guide ???,"The title ""guide"" for this book goes way too far. As I see it, it should be more structured inside the sections, i.e. listings of all the types of sets or snares (overview). Detailed Info's on smaller brands and European brands are almost absent. Nevertheless it gives good inside information on american drum company history. The book has certainly very important informations which you couldn't get anywhere else, but that's not enough for a guide...."
4,Works great...until it doesn't,"This bit was terrific. Just the right width for the floor tile and it went throught he grout like nobody's business. And then the tip wore out.I purchased this at Home Depot for $14.99. Don't know why amazon charges an additional $7.00, though."
3,Letters and Notes --- A work of Passion and Dedication,"While George Catlin is passionate of his desire to chronicle the North American indians and thier traditions, he falls short in the area of the east coast tribes and nations. The Cherokee, Chippewa, Choctaw, and Six Nations (Iroquois,Mohawk,Algonquin,Oneida,Seneca, and Tuskaroras ) all were an integral part of American history, They are observed on a minimal note. Comparatively, the Mmandans,and Sioux were beautifully chronicled with respect to the traditions and fears of the white man that were held among many Indian nations of the period. The detailed description of the rituals that a boy must endure to become a man, make one realize how trivial our day-to-day challenges really are. You cannot read this book and not gain a renewed respect of the American indian, and all they endured to please the White man,and avoid bloodshed in the name of peace,as they believed the great spirit wanted."
5,a great resource,"This is the book I was looking for when my attention turned to this dark era in history. Stackelberg, in explaining conservatism itself, helps to explain the thrust that was the coming of the Nazi regime and how so many went along with the flow. I am a beginner in this field of study and ""Hitler's Germany"" broadened my understanding a great deal. I could not recommend this book highly enough."
4,Grandfathers Pencil,This is a great book to inspire the imagination of students! The purpose I bought it for was to link to handwriting assignments. It was purfect for linking to family and to writing family stories. JW
5,Indiana loves you Frank!!!,The CD--Somewhere In Between is wonderful!! I am totally hooked on it. I also got the chance to meet Frank while he was in Indiana doing a show. A very talented musician and very inspiring songwriter.
2,Not a Perfect Storm,"I confess that I went into this book a tad cynical. I felt that anyone writing about smoke jumpers has to contend with Norman Maclean's unforgettable YOUNG MEN AND FIRE, but I had enjoyed-if that is the right word- PERFECT STORM so much that I assumed that if anyone could match Maclean's mixture of technical detail, energy, and lyricism it would be Junger. Well, he can't, or if he can he hasn't here. One gathers that just about everything in this collection was written for various magazines, and it is perhaps a pity that Junger didn't heavily edit the essays, revise them, focus on one or two topics and really make a book. Not that these pieces are particularly bad, I read 'em, but I doubt if I will remember them much past next month."
4,Nice book to understand parrots,"I found the book very useful. It explains the ""psychology"" of parrots and the best ways to teach them tricks. I recommend it!"
2,overrated!,"Yes, this movie has great cast, good acting, grand period setting but where is the meat? I mean, much touted mystery. The movie starts off slow and boring...and stays that way, despite so many people going up and down the stairs, in and out of rooms, in and out of light and shadows.Definitely overadvertised, overpromoted, overrated, overhyped, overpraised...I guess you get the picture."
1,Worst mystery ever!!!,"I would have gave this movie no stars but one was as low a choiceas they give you. It takes this movie forever to get to the murder and as long to solve. This is no sherlock homes, poirot,or miss marple type mystery. NOT EVEN CLOSE!!!. If you want to waste your money buy this movie. Its long and boring. ..."
1,Waste of time. The most boring film of alltime,"Typically I like these kinds of movies. With so many oscar nominations and wins, I really looked forward to this movie. However I was greeted by an utterly boring movie. The plot was slow, the movie just sludged along at an overly-leisurly pace. And plot? What plot? You wait for the entire movie for something to happen and when it does, the movie ends a few minutes later. I think that the oscar judges fell asleep when watching this movie; when they woke up and the movie was over, they couldn't remember whether they liked it and so decided to be on the safe side, save some shame, and award this movie.Never again will those precious minutes of my life come back."
5,For Anglophiles,"The depiction of life in the early part of the 20th centuary in an English country house is brilliant. I just loved watching Lady Trentham recounting her travails with training her maid. And I loved watching the servants bustling about trying to make their employers' lives comfortable.The snobbery and the bitching displayed was so very upper class English. For an anglophile like myself, who loves English books , this movie was delightful.The plot structure for the murder mystery was a bit weak. The explanation given for the murder was a bit far fetched. I won't say her why I think its fat fetched because in doing so, I will have to give the plot away."
5,Excellent - Period,"Excellent Period Piece with excellent acting.This is a movie I watch with friends,and usually with a martini or glass of wine.Interesting characters and the perfection to which the house staff adheres to will grab you. This movie made me want more, much more....Highly Recommend Downton Abbey as well."
3,Solidly Entertaining,"GOSFORD PARK is a solid piece of moviemaking, even if its' not director Robert Altman's best work. Alot of the blame, I think, lies with the plot, which isn't fleshed out much, leaving much of the acting talent to rely on snappy dialogue built around a somewhat hollow shell. Though it's touted as an Agatha Christie-style murder mystery, the murder itself doesn't even happen until well into the movie, and the movie has moved so slowly up to that point that it almost seems like just another irrelevant (lack of) plot point. On the plus side, as with most Altman films, the acting is top-drawer, highlighted by the brilliance of both Maggie Smith and Helen Mirren(in the film's finest performance). Overall, GOSFORD PARK is pretty good, again far from Altman's best, and ultimately highly overrated."
3,The movie is fantastic; the Blu-ray transfer is atrocious.,"I've looked forward to seeing this wonderful film in Blu for the longest time. Now that I have it I have to say that the picture quality is not at all good--in fact, it looks no better than DVD does on a decent DVD player. Such an opportunity wasted. And, I find I must keep my standard def version of this disc because none--that's right NONE of the excellent and informative special features from the SD version are on the Blu-ray version. There are no special features at all!This is a very underwhelming release of a best picture nominated film. It deserved better. I didn't know how many stars to give it, but I'll say 5 star film, 1 star picture quality, so I gave it 3 stars."
5,"Tough for the hard of hearing, but What a Movie!","I have a relatively common hearing condition which causes me difficulty in discriminating a single voice over other voices. This explains why Gosford Park is hard to hear for me, and some other reviewers: the audio consists of many layers of conversation going on simultaneously. In the pivotal after-dinner drawing room scene, there are at least 6 concurrent British-accented conversations layered on top of a paino singer!Never fear. I strapped on a pair of headphones and listened real hard. I discovered this is a GREAT MOVIE!"
2,"Slow, with an Unclimatic Plot","While Gosford Park provides an excellent look into 1930s English country life, the movie moves very slowly and does not have much plot to it. Once the murdered occured, I had hoped the plot and the pace would pick up, but neither did. And while there are some great lines in the movie, they are not enough to keep things moving. The costumes are very well done and the set is great; both are done to period. However, the cinematography does not do them, nor the plot, justice. The music is beautiful. Hats off to Patrick Doyle for another job well done. If you're looking for a study of 1930s English aristocrats and their servants, Gosford Park is the movie for you. If you're wanting a period who-done-it that twists and turns and keeps you rivetted to the end...watch Clue. You'll find it much more enjoyable."
2,Lost In This Park,"A normally outstanding cast makes up a so-so whodunit, focusing on the stark contrasts between the well-to-do and the working class servants who take care of them. ""Gosford Park"" has too many people whose identities get lost in this myriad of affluence. Yes, the cast is great (hence the 2 star rating) but it's hard to tell who's who, no less than whodunit. Perhaps a smaller cast would be better or better yet...if everyone wore nametags to identify themselves."
3,Gosford Park - disappointing!,"This whodunit is disappointing in my opinion. Aside from the breathtaking manse and countryside, and the star-studded cast (Maggie Smith, Kristen Scott-Thomas,Helen Mirren,et al), it seems weak in many respects.The scenes seem very rushed - almost like a cram for an exam - the dark lighting (I expect trying to be realistic for the period) was overdone. Plot was not bad but overall weak in many places.The film does capture the eccentricities of the English - note the beautifully laid out refreshments after the shoot but with muddy, slippery floor underfoot - and also does capture the culture of that time - snobbish uppercrust gents not averse to cavorting with the female servants.The best scene for me was the overlay of piano playing and songs while the crime was being committed with the servants really enjoying it as it drifted out to the corridor. The telephone conversation of the filmmaker from California at that time was also a bit overdone to be believable."
5,Maggie Smith,"This movie is great fun! You never know what will happen next - and - Maggie Smith, what more could you want?"
4,Please recognize Patrick Doyle,Patrick Doyle's score is simply stunning. His best work to date. The true gift of a film composer is to enhance the emotional arc of the picture while NOT interferring or calling too much attention to itself. This is really good film made excellent by a fantastic score.
1,The worst ever,"I have seen many movies over my lifetime. Yet this movie takes the cake as being one if not the worst movie I have ever bothered to see. I give it credit for being historically accurate, but then again so is the history channel. So if you want historically accurate watch that and if you want a plot that you can understand do not watch Gosford Park."
1,I read it cover to cover,"I've read this book about a dozen times, mostly for the explicit and violent sexual scenes. There are ten different chapters that discuss the dangers of drugs, homosexuality, sex and immoral behavior. It's poorly written and most of the chapters end with the evil-doer being beaten, killed and/or repenting for their sins. Rev. Lockelear provides a short discussion forum after each chapter for your convienence in case you didn't quite grasp the point of his writings. By most religious, intellectual and literary standards, this book is terrible and offensive. But, if you enjoy the assembled rantings of a religous zealot who makes almost no attempt to disguise his fanaticism and ignorance, you may find this book oddly compelling."
5,Not Just a Cookbook,"I think some people did not like this book because all they wanted was a cookbook. If anything, it is a Louisiana travel guide interspersed with plenty of recepies to keep you cooking all year! If you love Louisiana or love Emeril, then this is the book for you!"
1,Not cajun food,"I live in New Orleans. Emeril is a well known celebrity around these parts because of all of his restaurants and his TV shows. However, as popular as he is, the locals realy don't consider his food to be authentic. Emeril has taken classic New Orleans cooking, and 'Emerilized' it to a point that it is something completely different. A true native to New Orleans would not really appreciate Emerils version of something as simple as fried crawfish tails. This book is the same. While there are some 'interesting' recipes, they are not authentic, nor are they necessarily that good. I tried almost all of them, just to see how they would be. This was a sad mistake. Don't be fooled into thinking Emeril is a master Cajun chef. He's not. He is probably much better at pasta or other regional dishes."
1,Wish I could give NO stars!,"I bought this book around New Years Eve, because I was going to have a party with my friends. I thought there would be some great recipes in this book to entertain with. I had some real probles with the directions on some of the recipes. They were incomplete and inaccurate. Also, if you followed the recipes according to Emerils directions, the food had too much seasoning. The flavor was not very good at all. I was a little embarrassed in front of my friends, because I'm usually a very good cook. This book is not that good. I wish it were better, because I have always enjoyed Emeril before. I hope he does better in the future."
2,outdated-not a good book,I trade equities for a living and I thought this book might give me some insight on economic indicators. It's an old version and it doesn't provide much insight that can't already be found on the internet.
5,A Little Beaut!,"This is my second Lowepro Napoli camera case, as I lost the first one when we were on holiday this summer. It fits my Canon Power Shot SD850 perfectly, is elegant, and lovely to handle. Because it is so compact, it allows the camera to be stored easily in my purse, avoiding scratches and grazing - have even dropped it in its case on a fairly hard floor with no ill effects. You pull the camera's wrist strap through the hole in the top of the case and knot it (a nice big knot..), to secure the camera to the case. This also allows you to pull the camera from the case fairly quickly when you need to. Love this little camera case!"
2,Photoshop Elements 3: The Missing Manual,"Most of the reviews I've read were very positive. Unfortunately I did not find the book all that useful. It talks a lot about what Photoshop can do, but very little about how to do it. As far as a user's manual is concerned, it is still missing."
5,TOW-LINE,THIS TOY IS PRETTY DARN COOL EXCEPT FOR HIS POWERLINK TO THE BOTTOM OF THE VAN LOOKS LIKE A FREAKY ROBOT THAT WAY. BUT OTHER WISE VERY COOL. EASY TO TRANSFORM AND DURABLE. WELL WORTH A PURCHASE.
1,CD scratched will not play,received it in sealed package. i was anxious to receive it. opened it & put it in the DVD player and got an error message. turned it over & there was an inch long gash in the back. DVD is completely damaged and will not play. very frustrating!!!
3,Limitations,"Be sure you do not use saw for limits other than what it was made for.I used mine for an extended period of time and destroyed the motor. The saw is a good product, just use it according to directions.Thanks,Clarence"
1,A Bad Deal,"This is a bad deal for an electric chain saw because the drive gear is made of plastic and does not last very long.I bought a saw, used it three times on very small jobs and it stripped the drive gear, I took it to a authorized dealer. He said it could not be repaired and I call Amazon. They sent me another saw which worked about two or three times and it stripped the gear also.I tried to find the necessary replacement part to replace it, at my expense, whith no luck what-so-ever,I would not recommend that anybody buy a McCulloch at any price.Thanks,Fritz Hill"
1,"Bad Quality, Worse Customer Service","My McCulloch MS1630NT broke after only a few uses. This chainsaw is one of the worst tools I have owned. McCulloch's customer service is absolutely horrible, incompetent, and unresponsive. After weeks of calling and waiting, I finally gave up trying to get my chainsaw repaired. If you need a chainsaw, buy one from a company with a better reputation."
5,Ruthie Rules!,"Ruthie has an awesome voice and she never disappoints! As all her other releases, this one is right up there with the best! Keep the tunes commin' Ruthie!"
5,West Wing Season 4,"This was not might favorite season but still very good, the merchandise was of excellant quality and was delivered quickly."
5,West Wing Season IV DVD,I love the West Wing! The acting and the stories are always good! Aaron Sorkin is a great writer! The plots are often tear-jerkers
2,Prompt replacement,"We bought this as a gift for our son. When he opened it (new with factory wrapping) one disk was defective and there was a disk missing. Needless to say, we were disappointed.However, we were very pleased with Amazon's prompt response. They sent a replacement and made it easy to return the original DVD set.Thank you."
2,great - if you live outside North America!,"This DVD was intended for audiences outside North America. I can view it on my computer but not on my DVD. I was unaware of ""zone stamps"" on DVD. Apparently, each DVD carries a viewing code/zone stamp. The one I bought was for Europe, the Middle East and Asia - not America. I think that I will avoid purchasing DVD's in the future."
1,not cool.,"everything was great untill the last couple of dvds and then they wouldnt play in anything. i sent an email and was told i would be refunded but nothing has happened, it has been months. i sent another email and was never answered. very dissapointed. ugh."
4,Pretty good.,"Pretty good, though beginning to lose some believability. I saw the whole first 3 seasons, and this one just barely meets my standards."
2,Not up to the first three seasons,"Not only has it become even more TOO LIBERAL AND PREACHY, to agree with a previous reviewer, it's become just plain boring! This season is much more soap opera and less a plausible look at real issues than the earlier excellent seasons. Whereas I used to easily watch a whole disk (3-4 episodes at once) in one sitting, it now takes five sittings to get through a single episode. I don't plan to buy any more season sets."
4,Good primer,"Ordered this to help me move towards more subtle work in my practice. My sense is that it is a good primer for anyone trained in massage or body-work. Certainly helps to have some prior study of anatomy/physiology, and, goes almost without saying, that there's no substitute for experiential learning with a well trained instructor, especially for modalities that involve such subtle nuances and require deeper palpation skills. That said, Mary is a great instructor, the video renderings of anatomical structures and hand positions are very helpful, and there are even some more advanced tidbits thrown in here and there. Recommended as a primer and reference for beginners."
2,"More noticible, more forgettable","Shum Tucky is obviously an attempt to break Laura Love into the mainstream, as it includes reworkings of some of her best, little known material, in addition to new songs. More power to her, I say! Unfortunately, the slicker, more generic production makes Ms. Love blend a bit too much into an anonymous wall of female pop singers. Some of her greats, like ""Less is More"", *were* a bit homemade sounding on previous albums, or at least I thought so upon first listen. But they have held up well, and are generally much better than the versions on Shum Tucky.I'm looking forward to her next release. Go Laura!"
3,A fine colection but...,"No question about it, all the songs on here are great. However, you're better off searching for the expanded edition of this soundtrack, which has 4 extra tracks. It's out of print, but can be found in used CD stores. This soundtrack is often used to represent the baby boomer generation, but believe me, it barely dents the surface."
3,"a bit less schmaltz, please","I'm reading myriad texts regarding frontier women. This is fiction meant to give the reader an understanding of Ms. Starr. I thought it a bit long-winded. It does give some insight, but I would rather have read a biography or a shorter piece. There were truths within the text; I think that one must know Starr's biography in order to flesh-out the character. It does add a dimension to my understanding, but I think I would have edited it a bit more."
2,The 10th Justice rerun with new characters,"I actually liked the 10th Justice. Fresh concept, new writer, fun read. However when read #2 comes out to be the same plotline (characters blackmailed to be quiet or else and then pitted against best friends) with the same rush at the end, I was terribly disappointed. Meltzer robbed us on this one! No originality, no new plotline, boring. Shame on him!"
1,Grade school writing at adult prices,"It is quite obvious that many of the readers who've submitted reviews have read very little, if any, real ""literature"" in their lives. But even by popcorn book standards, DEAD EVEN is dreadfully ill-conceived and executed. It is truly an insult to compare Meltzer to Grisham or Turow or Baldecchi. These writers, albeit not Steinbeck, at least have a grasp on basic principles of writing such as character development, structure, and story. Much like the equally juvenile TENTH JUSTICE before it, Meltzer's writing and the thought processes behind it is painfully inadequate. That of course unless, these novels were meant for elementary school students rather than even semi-well read adults."
3,Dead Even,"A good enjoyable read, a little different from Meltzer's normal books where the book is centered around some event or thing in history, just a good story that keep you guessing."
4,Very Enjoyable,"Dead Even was a great book. Although the plot was a little too far fetched, the dialogue was entertaining and the plot kept me guessing. The Tenth Justice was a little more memorable but this was a well written book that assures me that Brad Meltzer is an author that will be around for quite awhile. The comparison to Grisham is inevitable so here's my opinion. Although Grisham's description and characters are more solid and interesting, Meltzer's plots are just about as good. If you want a book that's a fast, easy read pick this one up."
3,Good fight... if they weren't husband & wife,"I am agree that this is not a thriller, but is not a book that if you put down you will never want to take it back again, the plot of the book is very interesting and I really don't know if husband and wife can fight in a trial, one as a lawyer and the other as a prosecutor, if this is true I think that that law has to be modified, maybe it would be a better novel if they will be only friends or maybe they want to get married.The dead of Conrad is foolish and the end of the book is like a fairy tale and those ends I just don't like them, I like when the end of the book leave something to your imagination, something that you can end the book as you want."
1,"Couldn't Even Finish It, Zero Stars","It's very rare a book is so bad I cannot even bring myself to finish it. 100 pages into this clunker, I thought, ""Life's too short to force myself to finish this book.""The premise is ridiculous [even though as a lawyer myself, I actually ended up dating my opposing counsel near the end of a law suit]; the dialogue is worse than people in my first year fiction class came up with; and the characters are forgettable.I have read other Brad Meltzer books, and usually they are a fast, entertaining read. This is a real loser. I bought it thinking it was relatively new before I realized it had been written a few years ago, early in Meltzer's career.For those looking for a thrilling, well-written read for the beach or an airplane flight, I recommend you check out the author Harlan Coben, who I recently discovered, and just love."
2,Disappointing,"I decided to read this book after seeing the author on a talk show; even though it sounded only moderately interesting, the premise sounded intriguing. So I started out with fairly low expectations and still was disappointed. The writing lacks any spark of creativity, the characters are cliched, the plot is predictable, and the dialog is banal. I read it as quickly as I could, hoping it would improve. It didn't. Even the characters' legal expertise is questionable, as basic issues that are common knowledge must be laboriously explained by one supposedly experienced lawyer to another. I suggest that if anyone is determined to read this book, they borrow it from a friend or go to their local library. Save your money for something better."
5,"A clever, suspenseful roller coaster","I'm not an attorney, but my brother is and my cousin is. I can see all the events in this book happening. Ignore the reviews that said attorneys would be aware of the ethics violations. Of course they would. But given the right circumstances, they'd do them.This novel delivers better horror scenes than most horror-genre books. The mystery plot unfolds at just the right pace. Characterization is excellent. Voice is usually good, though a few conversations were confusing -- usually because I wasn't paying enough attention to the speech tags. Description is sparse but enough is there to carry the story. Above all, the story grips you and doesn't let you go all the way through the book. I can see a reader reading this through and disliking it. What I can't see is anybody putting it down once they've started it. The story demands that you finish it. That's good writing."
5,Good childrens book on Erie Canal,"This is one of the best erie canal book that I have read for kids. The illustrations in it are wonderful. It tells the story of the canal in such a way ,giving all the information one needs on the builduing of the canal .The maps featured in the book from buffalo to albany make it fun for the kids to follow."
4,Father of Modern Conservatism,"This book outlines many of the issues of the time. Senator Goldwater is very forthright in the expression of his views. If you have already read Barry, this is not the most exciting of reads, but is packed with historical information on the Senators beliefs. A must have for Goldwater fans! Go AuH2o!"
2,Uggghhh! Frustrating and difficult to use guide,"We brought this guide along as the one of two that we chose to lug all the way across the Atlantic. One was this one, the other was Frommers France (much heftier than this one). After two days of trying to make this one work we finally gave up and carried the Frommers around everywhere because we could never find restaurants or enough information in the Access guide. It was really frustrating to stand at the Louvre, look across the street at a massive church and find absolutely no entry in the access guide. It is very difficult to find a restaurant by type of cuisine (French, Alpine, Chinese) and many of the hours of museums and restaurants where incorrect in the guide, causing us a lot of lost time in futile trips. Definitely opt for the Frommers Paris or Frommers France books if you have a choice. They were great"
3,Usable for skating in the basement,Not smooth rolling and medium/slow speed. Rather clunky even for just turning. If getting for fitness you do end up working a little harder than just skating. They are large in the ankle. I ordered the 7 but normally wear an 8 in street shoes and still very roomy. I am not sure the advantage of leather lining since the rest of the boot is manmade.
1,The tedium of the long distance driver,"The novella recounts every boring second of a two day drive across Africa. Nothing much happens. The driver and the passenger don't much like each other, which might have made their conversations interesting, but no. They tediously repeated the same ideas over and over. Reading the book felt as monotonous and boring as taking a long car trip. Toward the end I just skimmed in the hope of speeding things along. Dreadfully dull."
5,Amazing album from an amazing talent,"The moment I heard ""I Love You"" was the moment I decided I need to have it on CD, so I bought the album. I was in for a surprise - not only did ""I Love You"" blow me away with its beautiful lyrics, vocals, music and production, but the rest of the album was just as good!The highlights inlcude the haunting title ballad ""It's Not Over"", the mega catchy ""Yesterday"" - surely the best R&B song of 1998 and one of the best *ever*, the melodic ""Who Do You Love"" that just sticks in your head forever, and the lovely ""Tonight"", in which Debelah Morgan's vocals shine more than ever.The artist has an amazing vocal range, yet there's plenty of emotion in her voice, which leads you through the beauty of each song on the album. This is an *essential* album for any R&B / Soul / Pop fan. You won't be disappointed, it's well worth the price and even more."
4,Anyone with a senior horse needs this!,This book has a ton of information! Even if you have a young horse you will learn a lot from this book. It's nice to know what sort of things I should look out for in my old mare. I found out I'm almost 10 years late getting this book! This book considers a 15 year old horse a senior!
1,pill box,This item worked for less than one week using it twice a day during that time. Was unable to set count down clock at first. Then the screen went completely blank.
2,"Full of detail but not of vision, breadth and personality.","Mr. Pitch lets us know he did too much research. He moves too specifically through the daily grind of the events without overall vision, perspective and review. More maps, drawings and military sketches would energize a slow read."
4,A WELCOME DISCOVERY,"Until I purchased this recording, I had not previously heard any of Louise Farrenc's music. This recording of some of her Musique de chambre is delightful in every way. The chamber music on this album is highly ""fragrant"" French romantic chamber music is very enticing. I particularly enjoyed the pieces for winds and strings opus 38 and the Piano Trio. I found the solo piano pieces, to me, to be mere trifles. However, all-in-all a fine introduction, for me, to a rather unknown composer. (Do read the previous superlative in-depth review for Louise's place in musical history) The sound, performances and presentation of this music by this French label is superb.If you are into romantic chamber music and of a rather curious nature, buy this disc because I know that you will enjoy it as I did."
4,Bake your own...Don't pay THIS MUCH!!!,These cookies are delicious but most assuredly NOT worth $8.99. Shame on Amazon for charging this much!!!! Amazing that Amazon has the audacity to charge this much. I have bought these cookies at Whole Foods for $4.99 and at Natural Grocers/Vitamin Cottage for $4.69. I thought THESE PRICES were too much...I was shocked when I saw them priced even higher on Amazon. Grace's has their own website but they charge more than Whole Foods. Since when did we have to dole out this much money to get a good cookie??? My mother used to make cookies this good - now I just need to find the right recipe to replace the need to purchase these too expensive cookies. I would rather do without and send the money to some needy family. Seems that Amazon would rather rip off the consumer and keep the extra for themselves.
1,Non-delivery of last purchase from Amazon via Born Again Books,"On April 22nd I ordered a copy of Edward Gibbbon's ""The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire"" (D. Lowe edition). Born Again books has attested that it communicated to Amazon that it could not find said book and communicated this fact to Amazon. I am desperate for a copy of this book and will continue to attempt to find one. Why has Amazon not apprised me that the order could not be filled? Please refund the payment from my credit card and if we are still friends at this time please help me tract a copy. Doug Meikle"
4,This Would Make a Great Movie for Young Girls!!,My 10 yr. old daughter Breanna loved this book! She cannot wait for Case 2 to come out! It was so much fun to follow these girls along on their first adventure. It's a great story line and she loved the characters so much. I think that Disney should pick this one up! The story is fresh & fun! Hats off to the author!!
3,GREAT STABLE MACHINE! SUPERB GRAPHICS/MULTIMEDIA NOTEBOOK,"I HAD THIS FOR ABOUT 2 MONTHS NOW. I AM IMPRESS WITH THE ATI RADEON GRAPHICS CARD AS IT PLAYS VARIOUS 3D GAMES. SO FAR I LOADED NEED 4 SPEED UNDERGROUND, AND FREEDOM FIGHTERS, AND IT PLAYS GREAT. BE FOREWARN; RUNNING A GAME ON CD REQUIRES LOTS OF POWER SO DONT EXPECT THE SAME PERFORMANCE ON BATTERIES.I HAD PROBLEMS WITH ERROR MESSAGES POPPING UP REGARDING THE SONY MEDIA SERVER. TECH SUPPORT HELP CORRECT THOSE PROBLEMSOVERALL, ITS A GREAT CENTRINO MULTIMEDIA/BUSINESS LAPTOP, ALL PROGRAMS WORK FAST AND THE SYSTEM SEEMS VERY STABLE.SO AFTER TWO MONTHS.. NOTHINS CRASHED YET!!! GREAT LIL MACHINE.. ENOUGH KEYBOARD SPACE.. AND VERY FAST! ONLY NEGATIVE... IS THE 2 X 256MB MEMORY THAT IT COMES WITH INSTEAD OF JUST 1 512MB! THOSE SONY EXECS ALWAYS TRYING TO MAKE MONEY FROM US!"
5,Its great,"I love sony vaio's. I have had this v505ex for a couple of weeks and love it. It is so fast, light. The screen is huge and the keyboard is great. It has a great warranty and sony backs everything."
2,"Hard drive, sound card, CDRW/DVD drive failures...","Purchased for my wife about 2.5 years ago. Not a bad little computer--save for about one year after purchasing the speakers quit working--which Sony fixed quickly as it was still under warranty. Then about 6 months ago the DVD combo-drive began to fail. Most recently, (two weeks ago) the hard drive has failed completely. (with some warning, but I was unable to back up some of the data before complete failure)Bottom line: Wife loved the computer--it was light, small, and had great battery life. However, ours had its share of problems and there are many people who seem to have similar problems with hard drive."
5,The best from Keoki so far.,"This disc in my opinion, is the best from Keoki yet, with ""Ego-Trip"" at a close second. Wonderful little tunes like ""Go Speed Go"" give you exactly what you'd expect from superstar Keoki."
5,I love all these nut combos!,"This particular flavor is for a particular person, but I love them. I, also, love all the other flavors. The other flavor combos. have a more mainstream taste. More people like the others. But, this one is good for the culinary adventurer. haha"
1,Not what I expected,"More pics of her home and how she's embellished, not my cup of tea. I thought it might give me some ideas, butI haven't looked at it but once."
5,used books at Amazon,This book came to me in mint condition and it was 1/5 the retail price. It also came in the mail a day earlier than I expected.I will certainly go this route more often.
5,A Broken Heart Still Beats,"As a bereaved parent, I found this a wonderful book for resource as well as to find comfort in the words of so many parents. We all speak the same language. I highly recommend the book and wish there were more like it."
3,Kids lost interest soon,"I haven't played this game, but my kids have. While its fun as a driving game, it would be vastly improved by having the big name trucks instead of generic ones. No grave digger here!"
1,Back Support Review,"Rather than support my lower back, it felt like I was wearing a fanny pack.Too much weight at the bottom"
4,good book,"good book, good story line but it was hard for me to stay focused as the writing style was rather boring to myself"
1,Boring,My 7 year old didn't like the story. She said it was boring. But I don't know if she didn't enjoy it because she.had to read a lot . She is such a lazy reader . U might think differntly. Its free that a chance
5,Tickling Tivoli tavi,I loved this book!!!***** it was a great original classic book I loved it and we all love that little mogoise
2,Don't pick this edition,"Rudyard Kipling's story is as wonderful here as it always is, but the artwork is this edition by Lambert Davis is muted, static, and downright boring. There's no sense of motion or emotion in the art, even for the action scenes. The birds aren't bad but the snakes and the mammals look more like plastic models than real animals -- especially Rikki. A real disappointment, especially for those raised on the Rikki video."
3,overpriced,"I purchased the item but unfortunatly it was very much overprices, the informations provided and amount of knowledge provided should not cost 250$, ( INCLUDING MAIL FEES TO SWEDEN)I expected much more especially the ( interactive language part !!), some games are much more interactive though!!Thank you"
5,perfect,"this is the cd that got me listening to freestyle music, i love all the song but don't cry over him is what i have been serching for and i finially have it"
3,Admirably Colourful...like a blonde in a bikini.,"Beautiful images and some useful information. A worthwhile read if you enjoy contemporary art mingled with some information. The closest likeness I can come to is Vogue magazine. Much focus is given to non functional glazes that have high toxicity and approaches analysis from a very non scientific viewpoint. Still not to be discounted and has very pertinent information within a limited scope. Off label uses include, coffee table conversation piece for intellectual suppositories."
3,A faint vent,"Does work, in direct, even oblique light. Turns slowly on a bright day even when not directly illuminated. Not very effective as the fan, though turning well has no shroud so most of the air in it is just stirred inside the unit rather than ejected. I made a card shroud, and put in a small drain hole for any water that gets in the body.I was only using it to change the air in a container slowly, it should do that, but it won't cool you down much."
3,Great Pollinator,"Maybe this is overpriced as a solar fan, but I found it useful as a tremor line for pollinating plants in my poly tunnel. The vibration from the fan was sufficient to shake a stiff wire that vibrated twine mounted in the cucumber and squash plants. The resultant vibration during sunlight simulated bee activity and helped the plants pollinate and produce fruit. That alone was worth $20 as it saved me the effort of routine activity.True, it's not much for moving air current. But a creative and inventive mind can make due with what they purchase. O2 makes a battery powered indoor outdoor fan that does an excellent job with movement. My Poly Tunnel is about 12' long and it does an excellent job. Note: I did 'Tim the Toolman Taylor' the O2 for maximum thrust. I couldn't hack Solar Panel Ventilator fan which is why I used it as a pollinator. Since I invested $25 I figure the twine and wire was a mod that gave me the most bang for my investment."
1,Not as advertised,"Retail for this item isn't $34.99. New Egg sells it for $7.00. As for its performance ... who knows? I ordered it when I purchased a new HP all-in-one from Amazon. The printer's here, but the cable ""is being prepared for shipment"" (no word on when or if will ever ship) and Amazon advises that I can't cancel the shipment. Wanna bet?"
1,Not as described,"The description for this cable claims that it is a Belkin cable. Belkin is a well known and respected manufacturer of cables and other accessories.The cable came in a cheap heat-sealed bag with a generic label at the top. The cable and the bag it was in was clearly a commodity item cheaply made in China. I work in China manufacturing myself and know this when I see it.There was a plain white typed or printed label stuck on the middle of the bag that said 'Belkin' and gave a part number, but there was no logo, no color, and clearly this did not come from the Belkin Corporation that we know in the US.This is a knockoff and if you think you are getting a name brand cable for a knock-off price, you are mistaken.The price however is appropriate for a knock-off item and it does work, so I'm not going to go to the trouble of returning it, but be aware."
5,Computer Peripheral Cable - Cheap & Excellent!,"This is a humble but required part running between computer and a peripheral, in this case a new printer. It wasn't included with the printer I was purchasing according to my shopping research. The printer can operate wirelessly, which is a desirable feature. My research showed it did require a cable in order to scan items into files. Had the printer on hand and wasn't sure about the cost/benefit ratio of heading out to shop for the cable from a limited selection of stores. Amazon to the rescue with one of its pre-Christmas deals. Cable with free shipping at a price well below the in-store price, with no added time investment or gas burned.Belkin is a well established manufacturer of needed but not-so-sexy items that keep our electronics up and running for us.Very happy with both the item and the price/service by Amazon!"
4,Good product,Never had a problem with this product since I purchased it. I am using it with my HP printer.
5,Great Price! Great Quality!,This unit sells for $20 plus in stores - same product. It's worth waiting the few extra days for shipping.
5,Great cable for great price,"I had this printer cable for a HP 4880 All-In-One and it had been working for 2 years without any problem. I just sold my old printer with the cable and got a new one for my new Canon MP560, still works like a charm.Made with quality material as well as sold for a cheap price on Amazon, you could never get such a good deal in Bestbuy or walmart."
1,Total Crap,"This cable is total and absolute crap. Doesn't even have the surge protector on it that makes USB cables hot swappable. Furthermore it doesn't work... if it cost more than $3 I would send it back on principal, as it is I tossed the junk in the trash. Word to the wise avoid like the plague."
2,????,"I bought this cable and everything worked fine for about a month and a half, then all of a sudden the cable is sometimey with me. When I print it will start but then lose communication with my computer and go offline. I think that it's the cable and not anything else."
1,Unsatisfied,"Ordered this item along with a Brother MFC-8840D Multifunction laser printer on the same order. Received confirmation that the USB cable had shipped 4 days prior to and from a different location. A few days later, Laser printer arrived but cable still had not arrived. A few days later received an e-mail from Amazon stating that the US Postal service attempted delivery of said cable, but my address did not exist. They then cancelled the order and credited my account. At that time I purchased the cable locally. Service like this sometimes makes you wonder????"
4,Belkin F3U133 USB Cable 10',"[...]Great product and great price. Not expensive and does the job. I am always thwarted by 3'-6' cables. This is a bit longer than I needed but worth it not to have the hassle with being ""almost long enough"". Quick ship and didn't break the bank."
5,as advertised,"hey, it's just a cable but i needed something long cuz i've got stuff all over my desk. the cables that often come with printers are so short! this one is long enough and gives me the freedom to connect my printer to my pc even though it's a few feet away."
4,It's a cable.,"Cable arrived before the scanner did. The scanner ended up on backorder, so we almost lost the cable before the scanner arrived. Cord is well made and operated without any glitches. HATE the clamshell packaging, though. It's stiff, and I broke a pair of scissors cutting it apart."
1,Truly disappointing,"I purchased the Belkin Pro Series USB 2.0 Device Cable; it does not work well. I have to unplug and replug it in the USB port in order to get it to work and even then it only works occasionally. It appears to interfere with my computers other functions as well. I would not recommend this product. I guess it's true what they say "" you get what you pay for""."
5,USB cable,"It's a shame you have to buy cables when purchasing printers. Fine if you are junking one and buying another-the cables are universal. But I gave away the printer with the cable of course, so needed to buy a new cable for the replacement printer. This product was a better price through Amazon than at the retailer. I did have to wait a few days for delivery, but it was worth it so save a few bucks."
5,Great product and service,Received the cable in great condition and fast. It works great and I received a 16 ft. cable and ordered a 10 ft. bonus!
1,Don't just think.....,"Don't assume you need this...it was suggested we needed to purchase this with the Cannon Scanner we picked out (read my earlier post about it). It comes with it's own USB cord...and this one would not work anyway for this Cannon scanner ... So now we have an extra USB Cable which does not fit anything we have right now. I only gave it one star as I have no way to test it out ....well let you know later if I need it, and in fact it fits on what ever I may need it for..."
1,Didn't work,"This thing wouldn't work with my Epson R1900. Was it too long? I don't know. But it would start to communicate, then abort. I haven't tried it with any other peripherals, but when I switched back to my 6' cable, it worked just fine again."
1,Wrong cord,"The cord was advertised as a 10ft. cord, but I was sent a 6ft. cord. Had to send it back and reordered with a different company. The company I originally ordered it from was Amamax Dist. Center in Houston, TX."
3,Wont turn off,After several months the button broke and now the light wont turn off. The good news is the battery life is amazing :).
1,The IR version does not stay on,"It turns on, it dims, it does all the functions said, but does NOT stay on. It turns off in seconds after you stop messing with the ON/Function button."
2,"LRI FMW Photon Freedom LED Keychain Micro-Light, White Beam","The seller performed well. However, I am not satisfied with the product and would not recommend it. The battery expired very quickly and easily turned on when in my pocket thereby further draining the battery."
1,Junk and/or wrong item sent.,I just got this item. It does not have the quick-release attachment as described; it does not have multiple settings as described; and the little button that's supposed to slide to keep it on absolutely would not budge until I finally broke it off trying. I thought the Photon was supposed to be great but this is junk in addition to not being what was advertised. Yes the light's bright but I specifically purchased it for the other features.
2,Great light - comes on too easily,"No question about the brightness, but . . . If you have something else in your pocket, it has a tendency to turn on and then when you need it the batteries are depleted."
4,Shuts off,"Yeah, it's nice and small and bright, but it shuts itself off after 10 or so seconds. A real pain.Updated rating based on the fact that I learned how to get it to stay on."
2,Had potential...,"This movie struck me as an independent, cheaper version of 2000's Road Trip. The general plot of this movie seemed to have plenty of potential for a decent comedy. Unfortunately, the movie drags in several places, and nothing particularly funny ever happens."
2,the worst drug movie,"the whole plot is mostley funny for about the first 30 min. but after a while it gets slow, repeditive, and just stupid. why cant the chariters just stop running into problems and just get the weed. i(the movie watcher) want to see the weed! the only reason why i kept watching the movie was in hopes that they would be abole to enjoy the fruits of there labor, but no they come up with a stupid idea to make sillt map t-shirts. the idea sucks and no real stoner would do that. a real stoner is a relaxed optimistic person and dont like to see bad things happen. i wonder how this movie even sold."
2,"Not typical Dennis Leary, not typical SciFi.","Dennis Leary is known for his high-speed humorous rants. I was hoping for THAT Dennis Leary.Science Fiction is known for special effects. Effects... SOME kinda effects.Neither was in this film.Oh, sure, Dennis Leary proved he could do a 90 minute soliloquoy (Did I spell that right ? *grin*) with fair impact. Kudos, Dennis.Beyond that, though, I can't see what others are raving about. The plot-twist was unexpected, but I kept waiting for things that didn't come: more evidence of chemistry between the doctor and Dennis, and SOME evidence of special effects.If you buy this DVD, be prepared for what it delivers: Good acting by one guy and his lesser-light costar, and a good plot twist at the end.Other elements you'd expect-- action, high humor, high tension, SF effects, technology of the future-- are not evident. This is a no-action drama with a plot twist."
5,whoa...,"some people have serious issues...what is this? a bratz feud? some people need an attitude adjustment or they need to just grow up. and what kind of so called ""goth girl"" would play with bratz?!? not much of a goth...anyways, these dolls are so cool but i didn't really like the doll with the yellow dress. the pink one is better."
4,Excellent quality!,"The Goldilocks flannel board set arrived promptly and appears durable. My 3 year old granddaughter enjoyed retelling the story as she placed the figures on the board...definitely good practice in sequencing and loads of fun. With the background included, you wouldn't really even need a flannel board. You could just pin up the background or lay it flat on the floor."
1,Ugh!!!,"Waste of time book. The ending was AWFUL like someone rushed her to finish it, what about Michael? He actually loved her and she and the author literally just wrote him off like he never meant a thing. Waste of time and money to read this stupid book, would NOT recommend!"
2,Almost useless case for great camera,"This is a leather case for the Digital Rebel EOS camera by Canon. It's made specifically for that camera.I never used the case because I realized it was difficult to put on, take off, and there were NO storage pockets for an extra battery or CF card. There is no point in making a case for a camera without a storage flap or envelope!I went to a camera store and bought a very nice soft case that could hold my camera with a 28-200mm lens, plus it came with 3 storage compartments. And that case cost less than this one!Even if you are a beginner with a camera, you must have an extra battery with you when shooting with the flash. Any case that doesn't have room for a battery (or even a CF card, those are so small!) was designed by someone who gave no thought about how to use a digital camera."
3,"Sounded great live, but the CD lacks punch.","I hate saying anything less than complimentary about Todd, but ""The Individualist"" left me a bit cold. I saw him play this material live a few weeks before the CD hit stores, and it sounded GREAT!! He had an excellent band, including Larry Tagg (formerly of Bourgeios Tagg, a band Todd once produced) on bass, a guitar wunderkind named Jesse, and the legendary Prairie Prince on drums. But the studio versions on the CD didn't have the same fire. In fact, the difference was staggering. Generally I love almost all Todd Rundgren stuff (especially his hard-to-find 1991 CD ""2nd Wind"" and his bossa-nova flavored ""With A Twist""), but the best thing going for ""The Individualist"" is the bonus goodies for your computer on this Enhanced CD."
4,Take Away 1 Star For Rapping,"I buy the album, I run home, put the disk in the CD player and I'm basking in Todd's harmonies, production and wonderful song writing!But wait! What's this crap I hear? The great Todd Rundgren has actually stooped to rapping and stoops even lower when using the term ""couldn't bust a rhyme!"" He's ran out of ideas!Rap goes against everything musical and is the opposite of melody. It goes against everything that sets Todd apart from everyone else. His strength is melody, and when he raps, it destroys all melody.Take 1 star away from an otherwise great album."
4,One of Todd's most under-rated. . .,"This was the first Todd Rundgren album I ever bought (I was inspired by a shout-out to Todd in a Meredith Brooks song) -- and it initially intrigued me because of the interactive features, which were cutting-edge at one time.So. . . I came for the extras, but I stayed for the music. Todd's released a *lot* of albums, so I'm sure a number of them have been overlooked or only casually listened to. But I think ""The Individualist"" deserves to be more widely heard and appreciated. It's a highly enjoyable, perfectly produced pop album that entertains even as it delivers Rundgren's signature ""tell it like it is"" lyrics. Like most of the best albums, it may not win you over on first listen. But there is some brilliant songwriting here.It isn't my favorite Rundgren album -- that probably goes to No World Order (which probably tells you I'm not a typical fan) -- but it's darn close."
2,Has Some Good Points Whilst Too Generalistic,"While Cati makes some good points about being careful whom you marry,her generalisations I find a bit subjective.She blanketsmost or all Muslim men as controlling,abusive and prone toaffairs whilst you are expected to stay at home locked intoa docile wife.Any religion when taken into fundamentalist realmscan be of danger to women,this includes Christianity.I havewitnessed horribly abusive situations in Christian marriages.In short,it is her subjective experience and does not in anyway represent the entire male population.The strong Christianbias against Islam is noticable."
3,"Just a show, not a 'concert'","Interesting show, but it's not a music concert. All that lip- synch makes me boring to watch, very lame. Fans always saying ""That's not a point, the point is she's stage presence and talent"" Well...remember, she's a well-trained-by-a-big-company-performer. how anyone can be a talented singer if he or she doesn't singing at all?I coudn't find any musical elements in this massive show, It really feels like watching a big music video, not a 'concert'Aside from that big disappoinment. It's a very enjoyable show. fun to watch...That's why I give it a 3 star. Recommended if you are dedicated fan of her, or fan of visually well-constructed show like me. But don't expect any musical experience.If you looking for a concert has both 'show' and real 'Music' at the same time, then try Madonna's 'Drowned the world tour' DVD.She believes every single breathe."
2,BOOOOO!....,"I know im going to get dissed majorly for this, but I don't care!! My friends and I decided to watch this when It first came out on HBO... I totally didn't get it?!?! why did she have to lip synch every single damn song... that got so annoying... Iknow it's harder for her to sing since she dances, but I know alot of people who can dance and sing at the same time! And what's this whole thing about trying to make a ""Young britney and sexy britney""?? she is such a contradiction!! Not to mention the in-between-song skits... like the hippy section... what the heck was that all about? I admit I do like some of britneys songs and it seems she does have a good personality, but this concert is not one of her best... I had to stop it before the end of the concert... cuz I was getting a britney headache.... MY TWO CENTS.. You may now attack...."
2,Enough already,"Does anyone else feel like their being force fed this girl? I gave this 2 stars because I love dancing & even thats getting old for her. The same moves again and again...... Additionally, the singing/lip syncing leaves a lot to be desired too. I just don't like singing/pre-recording when it sounds like someones sucked on a container of helium prior to the performance. I'm sure others gave it a better rating not b/c of the singing but for pure visuals or adolesence. To each his/her own."
1,I've seen it all before......,"this tour did nothing for me. I won't lie when I say the visuals were appealing to look at, with britney in her cute clothes and stage sets, but she TOTALLY rips off janet jackson with her dancing, style of dress and so forth, so I don't understand why little teenagers like her and won't give ms. jackson the time of day when she's the one who did it better than her. I got a sense of deja vu when I watched bits of this show, I felt that she purposely stole elements from the janet, velvet rope and all for you tours such as the costumes! Janet's All For You Tour, Madonna's Drowned World Tour and even Michael Jackson's 30th Anniversary concert were far more entertaining in 2001, and way more superior than this garbage. This garbage just goes to show that young & pretty stars are given more attention than those who actually have more talent that shines even without all the special effects in the world."
5,So entertaining,"The DVD of the Dream Within a Dream tour is so visually beautiful to watch even my family members who aren't Britney Spears fans were watching it. I admit, some of the song redentions were a bit hokey though. At the time, this was Britney's most well produced tour. Beautiful costumes, great dance routines in which Britney puts her heart and soul into, cool special effects, and just great overall energy. At one point, she even takes a break to address the audience and what she says comes from the heart and really shows her sweet personality.This DVD is also family friendly and doesn't contain any of the adults themes that were included in subsequent concert tours."
4,Britney is the best!,"This DVD is pretty sweet. I am not afraid to admit how sexy and awesome Britney Spears is. She has accomplished so much considering the over 50 million albums she has sold in 6 years! Okay, maybe she does not have the best voice but her music is pretty tight and always tops the charts. She throws the most entertaining concerts, especially this one in Las Vegas. I haveto admit that she does lipsync on some songs but HOW IS SHE SUPPOSED TO DO HER BAD ASS DANCES! But she does sing her song on the piano and the more mellow ones. This is an awesome show along with all of her other ones such as Britney Live and More and Time out with Britney. If you love her music videos, be sure to get her Greatest Hits DVD and CD."
1,Doesn't work with iPhone 4,"Tried to use this headset with my iPhone 4 and this MX500C headset picks up electrical noise constantly. My Plantronics M214C Headset with Adjustable Volume works OK. With both of these headsets an adapter is required for use with the iPhone 4 3.5mm headset jack. I used [Headset Buddy: 2.5mm Phone Headset to 3.5mm Adapter - Convert 2.5mm Headset to 3.5mm iPhone, Blackberry, Palm]."
4,Ear Piece Challenge,"The earphone/mic works well but the style takes some getting used to. It's an under ear style, rather than over ear. Even after using it several times, it's still a bit of a challenge to get it in place. Once on, it's comfortable and works fine. I use this in a home office and since it's not wireless, it's not feasible to just leave myself tethered to the phone. I'd rather be able to pick it up, slide it on and use it. However, it is too cumbersome to do quickly. About the only time I use it is if I'm initiating the call and have a minute before hand to set it up."
3,Moonlight - Abraham Lincoln and the Almanac Trial,"If John Walsh had set out to write historical fiction he would have been most successful. Mr. Walsh narration of the trial in the third chapter is superb and most believable.However, as Mr. Walsh repeatedly points out himself, few other historians agree with him. According to Mr. Walsh, all other Lincoln scholars are either wrong or have been too lazy to gather the evidence that he has. What is more likely is that they refrain from the same wild conjecture that is put forth in Moonlight.Moonlight is a worthwhile read on a topic of Lincolnia that is obscure indeed. Read it, but read is with a skeptical mind."
5,Advanced Crypto for the college mind.,This very detailed work is not for the light hearted. It's an in depth look at the mathmatics behind cryptography. If you're looking for a book to help you program then look for Applied Cryptography by Bruce the crypto king instead. If you're looking for something to help you learn cryptoanalysis and how to break codes then this is the first step.
5,Thorough and complete,"Menezes et. al. provide a thorough review of the field of cryptography. It's the first book I grab when I'm looking for something. Much more in depth than Bruce Scheier's ""Applied Cryptography"""
2,Not good,"Tits used to be a hard rock band. But during the 90's they adopted another style. They are still a good band with great songs and lyrics, but this album uses the same formula used in the Acustico MTV album. The difference is that they play flash-back hits from other artists."
4,Small but effective,"I was a bit surprised when it arrived and I saw its small size, but the flashlight provides a lot of light."
2,Bland and disappointing,"Robert Stone's book, while entertaining to a degree seemed like it wanted to be more of a novel of ideas and it never quite got there. Stone's presentation of faith commitments(variety of Jewish, Muslim and Christian communities) seemed distressingly superficial with a strong preference for a universalist position, i.e. all faiths are many roads up the same mountain. That is always the position of an outsider to faith traditions and so is incapable of shedding any light on the traditions themselves or providing any insight to the readers. This is especially unfortunate because the friction of Jerusalem in this novel is the friction of a variety of faiths and the secular humanist observers. It is bland like Joseph Campbell is bland. Parallels are nice, but in the end don't explain any community's point of view. Unfortunately Damascus Gate is more like your average/mediocre thriller then it would like to be."
1,"Bizzare Tower of ""Babble""","I was a Religion Major in college, and I lived in Israel for a year and a half, and I STILL don't get this book, so if I don't, I have no idea who does. Mr. Stone's portrait of Israel was bizarre, and while I understand everyone has a different experience there, his was completely unrealistic- I question how much time he has actually spent there, as he seems to have no grasp on daily life in Israel or Israelis in general. As another reader indicated, he seems to have gotten most of his information from a travel guide. As for the religion aspect, I could barely follow it, and I studied religion. And the characters? I could have cared less. In fact, I did- I couldn't even finish the book. The professional reviewers were obviously too embarassed to admit that they didn't get it either. Don't waste your time."
2,Gobbledygook,"I couldn't finish this. Slow, dull, overwritten and tedious. For a far better novel in this genre, read Rustad's THE TRUIMPH AND THE GLORY, or even better, Kleier's THE LAST DAY--one of hte finest suspense thrillers ever. But Stone was a bore."
2,The novel of the millenium?,"Being a citizen of Jerusalem, I was impressed to see my city with no real life or ordinary people(not even one?), but populated by all kinds of crazy, misfit, junkies and people with terrible identity problems and verging on a psychotic breakdown. There is no lack of craziness and intrigue in this city, but these peole lack in depth and seem mostly unreal.Besides, Robert Stone, seems to enjoy burdening the reader with words from several religions,slang and different places that make the novel mostly like a laberynth."
1,Big disappointment -- a real bomb,"After all of the 5 star reviews, I was really looking forward to reading this book. What a disappointment. The plot was hard to follow, thin and choppy without any continuity. The characters were forgettable (if you could remember them at all). It took me forever to finish the book. Worst of all, one has to have prior extensive knowledge of Jerusalem, Hebrew and all of the conflicts going on because there was no explanation of anything. As a writer, with all due respect, Stone cannot carry a torch to, say, Larry McMurtry or Pat Conroy or James Clavell. I'll be sure to miss his next book."
3,Requires a lot of the reader.,"Fabulous evocation of setting. You see, hear, and smell the Holy Land. Stone does require the reader to have alot of background knowledge of the Jewish, Christian, and Muslim religions and the Israeli-Palestine conflict. More than this layman had. I found myself wishing he would explain some foreign phrases and terms. I was past the middle of the book before the plot began to firm up for me. An interesting book, but you really have to want to read it."
1,Enter at Your Own Risk,"I will give Stone another shot, possibly with one of those earlier novels that brought his some repute. As far as Damascus Gate is concerned, I found it a jumble of nothingness, appropriate since the protagonist himself is bogged in the quagmire of religious confusion (and never surfaces), that is, the nothingness he professes at the outset is the same that he clings to at the conclusion. Depressing."
2,"confusing with a cast like ""War & Peace,"" yet nteresting","Having lived in Jerusalem as well as in Palestine and Israel, I am astounded at the detailed and intimate knowledge the author has of Israel, and of the the religious fanaticisms ruling that place and its time. Jerusalem today feels like South Africa in the days of Apartheid, with everyone hating everybody.The most surprising evocation was Robert Stone's use of the term ""Paskudniak,"" a Russian pejorat- ive, long out-of-usage, used in this case in the setting of a cafe for old time leftists in Jafo. It was a chiascoro illumination of a vaguely remembered landscape.Even with its impossible large cast, none of which them filled out in depth, the book held me spell- bound, mostly because it triggered so may faded memories."
1,rash,"I don't think I have sensitive skin, I'm pretty average, but every time I try to use this I break out into a really itchy red rash, I could be allergic to one or more of the ingredients, but I have no known cosmetic allergies, this is the only thing that makes me get a rash like that. I have other olay products like facewash and those have been fine. So if you have potentially sensitive skin, be careful!"
2,gives break outs,My wife got this product based on the reviews observed. She has a sensitive skin and so tried this fragrance free version. But it still gave her boils on her skin ocassionally!Also she did not see much improvement on facial skin after using this product. She will not buy this product again!
4,Asking too much!,"After I bought this product from Amazon I found out that it's $13 cheaper at BJ's. I like the effect on my skin, but I don't like to know that the ingredients are not all natural."
4,Long-lasting moisturization,"I live in a very dry area and this is the only product which I can put on in the morning and never need to re-apply to make my skin supple. With that said, I was disappointed when I found out that its health hazard level is 6 out of 10.http://www.cosmeticsdatabase.com/product.php?prod_id=5822&refurl;=%2Fwordsearch.php%3Fquery%3Dolay+regenerist%26"
1,very disappointed--breaking out,I purchased this based on all of the great reviews. I have been using this serum for a few days now and have started breaking out all over my face. I'm 33 years old and usually don't break out. I use Olay products and this is the first time I've broken out b/c of one of their products. I don't see any improvement in my skin. I had high hopes for this. Very disappointed.
4,Good product,"This serum does make my face feel a little tighter and firmer during the day. It is not at all greasy or shiny. I put it on in the morning before I apply makeup. I can't tell that it makes a difference in the way my face looks, but it may make my skin look slightly firmer. I don't think any lotion or serum will make my wrinkles disappear. I put a different night cream on my face at night, as this serum doesn't feel especially moisturizing. It does feel good under makeup during the day though."
4,Pleased with product,This is not greasy and absorbs nicely. It's a good value and makes my skin look better.
3,NOT IMPRESSED!,"I had such high hopes.... Since Olay received some great reviews, and was ranked #1 by Consumer Reports, thought I would love this serum. Not hardly! This product clogged my pores and I ended up with several unsightly pimples. I did not ""glow or feel radiant"", as others have claimed. Wrinkles are still there too. Will only use this on the backs of my hands and will NOT buy this again."
4,"Good for men, too!","About two years ago, I was looking at my older brother's face (who is five years older than me), and noticed all the wrinkles and age spots on his facial skin. I was determined not to look that way. Because it is considered ""unmanly"" to use anti-wrinkle products, I turned to the companies that manufactured women's unscented products. I use this gel every morning after shaving. (I have another Retin-A product I use at bedtime). This ""serum"" requires you to only use a little at a time; and I usually get 3-4 weeks use out of it. Now I am 60 and get compliments on my skin (99% from women!)"
3,$260.00???,I have been trying to find this game everywhere!!! Can anyone tell my why in the world a board game would cost $260.00?? I heard this game was fun but that price is ridiculous. I am guessing that Hasboro stopped making it... Any ideas?
5,Great game for adults,"I purchased this game for the best friends of my son and his wife who come to visit us with them. They love games and introduced us to Apples to Apples, which is a fun family game. They love this game and have played several times already since Christmas. We can't wait for them to come visit so we can play it with them. It arrived in record time! (love Amazon btw) A very good purchase."
4,Fun Game!,"This is a really fun game, especially good for parties and holidays with friends and relatives. We have never seen it in stores, so I ordered as a Christmas gift for the family. Our brother-in-law seemed to get the funniest cards and so we really laughed alot!"
4,Hilarious!,"We have an annual game night the evening before Thanksgiving with my wife's siblings, cousins, and their spouses. We ordered this game prior to the game night last year, but didn't receive it in time. We played it this year and everyone loved it. It's similar in concept to Apples to Apples, but more fun."
1,DUMB Game,"Everytime I go to a game night, this game is always included. I do NOT know why! I loathe this game. It's pretty much like Apples to Apples...except it's supposed to describe the person reading the cards aloud.Eh.I think the reason I rather dislike this game is because the answer options are so dumb. I don't find them at all funny. I'd much rather play a game where we're supposed to describe the reader by giving one of our own answers, not ones that are pre-written.Instead of this game, I highly suggest Loaded Questions."
2,Avoid at all costs!!,"Boy, is this CD bad. from what i can gather from my little experience as a musician, any classical music is comprised of Virtuosity (rd:speed) and feel. Yngwie, undoubtedly, is a master of both. these wannabe punks on the other hand have destroyted the whole feel factor and their playing is very sloppy too. another thing, the covers here are played EXACTLY NOTE BY BOTE as done by yngwie, no creativity whatsoever.I've given it 2 starts just becasue of Eklundh's original Yngwie 2000 (last track). Eklundh, in my humble opinion, is European answer to Steve Vai. BRILLIANT GUITARIST, and certainly the only saving grace of the entire album. his use of harmonics is just KILLLEEERRRR!!Moral - download yngwie 2000 from somewhere and avoid the rest of the album at all cost"
5,sanding discs,"These sanding discs are of very high quality and last a long time. Compared to the big box stores and places like Sears, they are priced very fair."
3,missing one disc,"sanding discs have worked well and I am happy with purchase.However, the order was missing one disc which no doubt can happen with modern technology counting. Still a good bargain compared to the products sold at the big box stores."
4,Good disks,"Very good, long lasting discs, however in my case I didn't see the use for 100/150 after trying them out. I found no problem going from 80/120/220 to get a smooth finish with no sanding marks."
4,sander discs,good selection of grit grades at very resonable price. They last well and fraying on edges is limited. Good buy and good service
3,Extinction in a nutshell,"In his book, Leakey raises valid and often disconcerting points regarding the latest mass extinction of species on Earth. He calls this the ""Sixth Extinction"" and in comparison to the relatively obscure or uncertain causes of the previous five massextinctions (The ""Big Five""), the ""culprit"" is certain: ""We (humans) are."" Leakey disappointingly spends the majority of the book describing and explaining the Big Five and effects of extinction on biodiversity. His descriptions are lucid although rather annoying and painstaking at times. We would recommend this book only to those really interested in mass extinctions and how humanity has brought about the lastest one. If the reader can move past the overtly condescending tone and fatherly attitiude, the material is certainly worthwhile."
4,"A review of the 3 Disc set, the only one offered currently","I'm giving this set a 4 for a couple of reasons. Number one, the value of the set and the material contained within is exceptional... Cowboy Bebop is my favorite series and is far better than just about anything else on TV. As well, the sound is very good, even though it is only Dolby 2.0. Keep in mind this is a television series, and you'd be watching it in 2.0 normally anyway. The video is for the most part great, although some areas do have some artifacts and pixelation. It's really not as bad as others on this site would have you believe. I highly reccomend this set."
5,What's not to like about Cowboy Bebop?,"This is the greatest show I have ever seen. It's great. It has eveything that a great show needs. The action is great. If you really watch the hand to hand fights, you will notice it's not choppy. It's very smooth. It looks almost real. I think Yoko Kanno, (the composer of all of the music), is a genius. The music is great. The jazzy tunes go along so well with the show. You have the fast tunes for te fights, and the slow one for the emotonal scenes. The characters are awesome. Spike is totally badass. The characters are so likeable. Even Faye even though she can be very annoying sometimes. I got so attached to this show and I love it so much, that when certain things happen, (I don't want to spoil the show), I felt so depressed. I still am. I always think of Cowboy Bebop. Every time I go on my computer I listen to Cowboy Bebop music. The action is great. The music is great. The characters are great. So tell me, what's not to like about Cowboy Bebop?"
3,LONG SHIPPING,This item takes FOREVER to ship. I was expecting to wait a month for it but then amazon sent me a delay shipping thing and now i have to wait another month. But the product itself makes up for it because it is truly at the top of its class in anime and to me is second to no one.
2,"Cheap, but looks good from a distance.",I bought one because of the price and the marble tops. If the legs were better I would give it a 5 but with the crappy legs it comes with only a 2
3,Happy but with a warning,"This product is good, just beware:The clips to hold the tunnel together are on the same part the baby is, which means it could be hurting the baby."
1,Bottom melted making rice,"I followed their instructions but used coconut milk and water as the recipe called for, wound up with a rice cake and melted platic... Don't use coconut milk or buy a better cooker, this one is cheap plastic."
1,Marble top split in two pieces upon arrival,I was very disappointed to receive this table. The marble was broken into two pieces and no longer even attached to the wood frame. Would have to pay an outrageous amount in return shipping because of how heavy it is..
1,"Oh, no!","We seem to be in a minority here, but my spouse and I are in agreement with the person who found this book a complete waste of time. It's the ONLY book we've sent back to Amazon as ""not what it was cracked up to be"" -- by other customers. We wanted a supplement to dance lessons we're taking, to help us practice at home. No help whatsoever! Anyone wishing simple, clear, easy-to-follow instructions: Get the Nancy Hays video: Bring Back the Romance of Dance."
3,Something's very strange here...,"I'm looking for a book on dancing to fortify our beginner lessons, but the reviews for this book are useless and highly suspect. I've never seen a book that has either 5-star ""it's the greatest ever"" ratings or 1 star ""it's the worst"" rating, but NOTHING in between. Is there a political war going on between people who know the author? I'm curious if anyone has an OBJECTIVE review of the book?"
1,Awful toy,We had so many problems with this toy with in the fist couple days of getting it and then it jus broke... This is the worse thing I've purchased on amazon and I'm very disappointed
5,Love it!,I love my Christmas tree it is soooooo cute!!!!!!!Las luces funcionan perfectamente....This is a very cute Christmas tree and it looks fantastic.
4,A Good Weekend Read,"I read the book over a weekend and enjoyed it very much. I will admit at the end, it left me wanting more. But I realized that if more was added Ms. Hinton's meaning may have been lost. I am one to read books where the main character(s) is much closer to my age. However, I was able to see my grandmother and the ladies of her church in these characters. Not to mention, I got some great recipes."
2,TOO SWEET FOR MY TASTE,"Although some readers will fine this book entertaining, it was much too sweet for my taste....I did not finish it. Just could not take this much sugar."
2,Friendship Cake Fell Flat,"Friendship Cake fell a little flat for me. I had high expectations and was looking for a touching story about friendship. This novel does have a cute story about a circle of women who are all members of Hope Springs Community Church. In an effort to cultivate their friendships one of the ladies decides the group should work on a church cookbook. We get introduced to a little bit about each character's lives, but I felt that the author just scratched the surface and there wasn't a lot of substance. It is an easy, light read and if you liked The Persian Pickle Club, you would probably like this novel as well. I felt it had the right ingredients, but they just weren't stirred up enough to cook up any real emotion."
3,Left some ingredients out!,"I did think this book was sweet. The Idea of recipes woven into the story intrigued me. I do love a book about women's relationships, female bonding, and Ya-Ya sisterhood stuff!!...But ""Friendship Cake"" lacked in ingredients. It just didn't have the spices and herbs required to make the recipe reach the depth of true taste.The women, at first, appeared interesting. But their characters remained the same, flat, and non-demensional...as if the yeast was forgotten, which would have allowed the dish to rise, brown, and bring a sweet scent to the room.I found myself not caring what happened to the characters, but did care about the recipes, such as the ""sweet potato pie"" and ""fried grits.""I don't have to tell ya, that's not enough."
3,Quicken review,Performs all basic functions which was what I was looking for. I'm using this on a MAC (Parallels) and Quicken 2007 is far superior to the Quicken For Mac.
3,"Good, but not great","It isn't the greatest political novel ever written, that award has to go to ""Primary Colors"", however for a debut it isn't bad. Being someone who works in politics and reads a great deal of politically related books, I think the book has moments of great campaign text, but gets a little weak in the sappy, sometimes drawn out paragraphs about O'Connell's former girlfriend. At times I found myself skipping whole pages to get back to the story, which is much more entertaining and certianly more exciting. Overall a good book, that had the potential for greatness. Would recommend to friends after it comes out in paperback."
3,Beyond the Zone System,"The title of this book is misleading, when i bought this book, i thought that it would be about applying the zone sysyem in an everyday way, how ever this book only talks about the zone system, and how to use it. however it doesnt go beyond any other zone system books."
1,Complicated and unpleasant to listen to,"I found this complicated to load and use, and another huge disappointment is that it has a computer generated voice singing the tunes. I find it unpleasant and unnatural, stilted and hard to listen to, jarring to the ears. Too much money for a cheap product, which isn't even nice. I much prefer the less expensive, but far superior TES 'Navigating the Bible 2' program, as a real chazzan is singing the passages, and the program is extremely easy to load and use."
5,Great BMG Special Product CD,"This ELVIS Best of Love cd was a pleasant surprise. I was well pleased with the unusual choice of songs like IT HURTS ME and YOUNG AND BEAUTIFUL but the real surprise was the excellent sound quality and great liner notes in the small booklet inside. For the price , this is one of the best cds I have purchased in some time."
4,Good resource for Sunday School teachers,"I'm responsible for creating a short, fun, pre-class distraction for the 1st- through 4th-graders at our church each week, and I like to include several Bible trivia questions. This book has been a handy resource for those times where I need some new ideas for questions to ask. The book features a wide variety of questions -- different formats, different difficulty levels, etc. Bible verse references are provided to back up the answers.Great for Sunday School teachers, parents, and families!"
2,"Incomplete, Unbalanced, Filled with Errors and Hard to Read","The title of this review sums it all. This book only benefits from a catchy title that gets the attention of people looking for a good book to get a flavor of the world history. You buy it and every few months you give it a stab and you finally leave it on the shelf for good thinking the world history is a tough subject to get into.The biggest problem is that it is very boring and difficult to read. No pictures, maps or timelines, all text, tight font, arcane British English and worst of all it moves from one topic to another randomly.How much does this book say about the greatest empire of the ancient world, the Persian Empire? Very little.I m looking at A History of World Societies by McKay, it has errors and has some issues but it is laid out beautifully, reads fluidly with great maps and timelines and is a page turner. Makes you love history."
2,Too perfumey,"Very strong perfume smell. Was hoping it was a more mellow vanilla scent. Too strong for me, and if you have allergies can create a sneeze attack!"
1,"Should have been entitled ""History of the Vietnam War.""","This book provides a fascinating, chronological look at the history of the Vietnam War. As a quotation reference, however, it is next to useless. Unless you know who you want to quote, or are willing to read the book cover-to-cover, you aren't going to find what you're looking for in this volume. I own a substantial number of quotation books. Some are easier to use than others, but this is the most difficult in my collection.If you want to capture the year-to-year history and thoughts of the Vietnam War, buy this book. If you're looking for a quotation reference, look elsewhere. Very disappointing."
2,"An interesting story, needs editing, and writing","Probably a quickie true crime book that I would have passed over if it had not been for the Richmond connection to may home state.I think the author did some decent reporting, but she more often than not presented the story in a rather flat fashion. She missed many opportunities for emotion and facts to give us background on the women involved in the story.Also there were some glaring typos in the edition I had that should have been caught by the editor."
4,Both kids love playing this game,My two and four year olds both enjoy playing this game. The different levels allow the game to be used for several years. It's a great toy to bring to the restaurant or doctor's office. It's quiet and really keeps the kids occupied.
2,Incompatible and had to return,I had no idea that Leapster was incompatible with Leap Frog 2 and Leap Frog explorer. Leap Frog should do away with such an old product and fitting it to the new hardware.
2,basic video game,where's the education component that was advertised? we were disappointed to say the least. the game basically involves using your thumb muscles to make diego run and jump.
1,Made me sick,"I am trying to get away from products that contain zinc, and thought this would be good. Something in it dropped my blood pressure (usually 110/65) to 97/60. and also made me very nauseous"
4,Good product,"I was worried about the toxicity of other denture gripping products, plus they can be nearly impossible to remove from the denture itself. Secure seems to have less toxic properties and it holds well enough, although I think it may wear off a little more quickly over the course of the day than other products. But it will definitely hold well enough to get you through a couple of meals and it is definitely much easier to remove when you go to clean your dentures. The taste is much less pronounced as well."
1,Secure Denture adhesive,"This product is not worth buying....says it lasts 12 hrs. I used it once, it did not even last 5 hrs...there are denture adhesives for sale in stores that work much better then Secure and yes they are zinc free. I would not recommend this to anyone. I paid over $8.00 by the time shipping was added on, I could have bought 2 tubes that are bigger for that price and work better."
1,Secure not secure,"I purchased secure denture adhesive hoping it would perform as touted; however, I am sadly disappointed. After first application, my upper denture stayed in place for three days due to the suction of my palate so I no longer use it on top. However, my lower dentures do not stay in place for anything like 12 hours. In fact, polygrip or fixodent work just as well on the bottom and I carry a tube of fixodent in my purse for ""repairs"" after eating or drinking (hot or cold) outside my home. Further disappointment stems from a lack of response to my email to customer support of at least a week ago after first using the product, asking for suggestions or indications as to what I might be doing wrong and should/could do to correct the promlem."
2,smaller than expected,"good service, but disappointed in size of product. smaller than what I thought chain would be from measurement and picture."
1,Empty Pouch,"I have been shopping on amazon for about 3 years and i was shocked when i opened the box.. The pouch was inside a plastic bag and as soon as i picked it i felt wierd... I was wondering why am i not feeling the chain, in complete disbelief i open the plastic bag and pull the pouch out... It was EMPTY.. I am in total shock this happened, since i was really looking forward to this chain... I called amazon right away and since it was fulfilled by them, i was issued a refund which is a good thing.. However i cannot wrap my head around the fact that someone acttually sent me a empty F***ing pouch.."
4,Pretty but heavy,"I ordered these earrings based on the review I read. They are pretty earrings, and they come beautifully packaged in a tiny drawstring pouch. However, they seem heavy when worn, and the posts seem a little on the large side. This makes them less comfortable than the earrings I'm accustomed to wearing. But, overall, a good deal when considering the price."
3,Confusing picture,I thought from the picture that the toy came with the power ranger. I was upset to find that I was only getting the motorcycle.
5,a life saver,"This isn't the first one I've owned. I ordered more because I like to wash them out in the sink between meals. I have 3 total now. I like that my little one can't remove it but if there is an emergency it comes off easily because of the velcro tie. I velcro it under the straps on my little ones high chair, which keeps the bib from coming up around her face. This is a must have when starting solids...its saves me a lot of time from getting food stains out of her clothes!"
4,Forgotten Classic or Not ?,"I used to watch this cartoon ever since I was a little kid,I had a great time with this one,but it's very hard to find anywhere.It's a good thing I had found the right one on amazon.com and in good condition too.This cartoon was made by animated director Bill Melendez,the creator of Charlie Brown cartoons.This is a mixture of three of Gilbert & Sullivan's operettas such as H.M.S Pinafore,The Pirates of Penzence,& The Mikado.It tell the story of a secret agent{Dick Deadeye}who Searches for a unknown stolen document called the ultimate secret.In my opinion,this is the most hillarious musical cartoon that you have to see for yourselevles I wonder if they going to remake this classic cartoon on DVD?"
5,Great Case For Canon S100!,"Had several Canon Powershots before the S100, and used a Lowepro Napoli 10 to protect them. LOVE that case, and one of the few all leather cases that looks slick out there... When I bought the S100 the Napoli 10 would not fit it. Went on Amazon and found the Napoli 20... slightly larger version... if you were to set the 10 next to the 20 they are identical save for their size. Fits the S100 perfectly!"
5,most fulfilling book,"Pilgrim Souls was one of the most fulfilling books, spiritually and intelectually, that I have read in a long, long time. In is an immense collection of writers who have so much to offer. I personally enjoyed St. Teresa of Avila, Victor Frankel, and Flannery O'Conner. Actually, I loved and learned from all of them. I've already recommended this book to all of my friends. END"
1,Sad for Amazon,"I have been a loyal customer to Amazon. It is very sad for amazon to allow such item that spread bigotry and hatred to be posted in this site. Very sad indeed.How much have amazon earned by selling this sticker? Rest assured if more are made aware of the existence of such sticker in amazon, amazon will not even know how much they have lost.Please. Take it out of your site and let the roadside sellers sell this kind of stuff. Not amazon. Please."
1,Why is this still here....?,"I'm appalled that Amazon is selling this. I didn't know that Amazon was in the bumper sticker business in the first place, but this is just disgusting. This offends the 1/5th of the world's population that are Muslim as well as all those who sympathize with their situation today. I want this removed and pledge not to purchase anything else from Amazon until it is gone."
4,"Good compact, short range choice","If you are going to be using this keyboard within a few feet of it's receiver (usb) then it performs excellent. If you planning to use is at distances >10' I think you'll be disappointed. I've purchased three of these keyboards/trackballs each I've found to be different from the others. The keyboards functionality of all three, at a short distance has been excellent. The trackball's on one performs perfectly, on the other two it's not as smooth ay you would like, sticking, requiring two or three spins to get movement. Battery life is better than expected. So that you know; the keyboards ""shuts down"" to conserve battery life, you need to click on one of the mouse buttons to ""wake it up"". Keyboard has a good balanced feel in your hands which was a primary major concern, just wish the track ball was not so finicky."
5,FUNNY FUNNY FUNNY!!!,"I loved this book!!! I have never read one where I laughed as hard as I did in this one. And the story was just beautiful. If you enjoy romantic comedies, RUN OUT AND GET THIS ONE. It's going to be worth it!"
5,A Great Read! Wonderful Book!,"I really enjoyed reading this one. It was everything you would want a book to be. Very funny, passionate, a DEFINITE PAGE TURNER! I didn't want to put it down. It was a terrific story. I hope there's a sequel. I think this one is it! Bravo!"
3,Britain still at fault,"Was British India such a high prize for the declining empire ? at least Anscombe thought it was. The book seemed to try everything at defending the British policy during those years of the Ottomans decline. Imperialism never been defended so thoroughly before. The idea of the Arabs better off siding with the British rather than the Ottomans stood on a shaky ground, The Lawrence of Arabia proved it all. We even had a 'Snouck Hurgronye' in Aceh as equivalent for this so called 'Lawrence' who roused 'national' and emotional feeling against fellow Muslims.The account on naval advantages of Britain was accurate enough to maintain the integrity of this book. The Ottomans and the whole Islamic power throughout the history were always handicapped by a naval deficiency, at least that was presented successfully.Try it only if you have read similar books, otherwise stay out or stay cool."
3,"Smooth, Mellow Golden-Toned Alt Country","This album is a smooth mix of Alt Country goodness. It's a mellow album, with all the songs following the same mellow groove. You could almost call it chill country I guess! I have heard this guy compared to Ryan Adams and I think it's a fair comparison, but Ryan's music has a lot more life and vigor. I kind of wish the album would have a bit more varied song styles or be a bit more dynamic.The sound quality is very good, it has a golden analog/tube sound that is very addictive (and suprising in a CD). The voice is very well-miked and the guitars play liquid gold. The achilles heel of the album though is the lack of dynamics, the instruments never really break through the polite mix, and the music never really takes off."
5,I love this!,"I saw this in a little shop a few years back and didn't pick it up because it was triple the price. Regret, regret, regret...but knew it was too costly for for $75. I was so happy to see it on Amazon. You would not be disappointed!"
5,Cat & Dog Umbrella,I received the umbrella in excellent condition. It was delivered in a timely manner. I used it as a halloween party prop and it was well received by everyone. I'll be using it again when we have rain.Amazon delivers when it says it will.
3,okay,"This story is beyond little kids, so I don't think it should be marketed to that population with the CD for kids learning to read. It also is very confusing in the plot in parts, at least for a child to follow."
3,"But I HAVE to watch 60 minutes of TV, how else will I get fit?","I purchased this for some seniors that want to get some exercise on it. Assembly was easy, the screw for resistance works as advertised, the straps have three adjustable ""sizes"". Will one get the exercise that tires one out, that's hard to say, really depends on the lack of shape to begin with. I tried it out and to me, I was bored with it long before I could tire out on it. With no resistance, one could pedal carefully and not move the whole unit. When one adds resistance by screw, it is harder to try not to move the whole unit. The user may have to add some weight to keep the unit from moving. You can also pedal with your hands. Overall, it is an ok product. It may have it's use, perhaps for someone who needs to rehab due to an injury or someone who really can't exercise using another method."
3,Great product - not assembled as stated,"Product arrived on time and is working perfectly fine. I am using desk pedals under desk at work, and there are no issues. Only problem was that it wasn't assembled as stated in the title. I had to assemble on my own, which wasn't hard but title should be changed."
2,Fully Assembled?,"This bike pedal did not come fully assembled at all. Although easy to put together, when it says fully assembled, I expect fully assembled. The bike pedal did not work for my mom -- it was not easy for her to use. Definitely not an item for an older person."
2,"Great cast, lame script, not filmed in Burma","I have to disagree with folks who like this film. The action scenes are extremely lame. Even the gunfire sounds like blanks, not real shots. The scenery could never be mistaken for Burma, it looks like, well, the Philippines! Despite earnest performances by all concerned, especially Chandler, the script goes nowhere and is merely a string of cliches. The budget must have been tight on this one, and it shows all over. The only decent music is stolen from ""Objective Burma"", a far superior production. It's too bad, as the cast here could have done fine with a better script and budget."
2,Don't waste your money or time,This book is a waste of time and money - very confusing with poor picsBuy McDermott's book - you'll be much happier
4,Wrist pad for keyboard does what it claims.,This product is good. The foam supports great and the shape is interesting. The rubberized backing works fine. The product is worth the price.
3,First time reader.,I liked this book for a first time out with the author. But not sure I like it enough to try her other books. Slaughter keeps the pages turning but the ending was a predictable and the characters not likeable at all.
4,Love finding a new author...new to me that is.,"Fun, fast and exciting plot with quirky, human characters kept me engaged and wanting more. I will be trying more books by Karin Slaughter."
4,Sometimes a bit too much information,"Karin Slaughter certainly writes well, but at times she's a bit to graphic for me.I'm not a gruesome fan. But it is a good story, and I will continue with the series.Since I've read the newest books first, I find I'm looking for the back story to it all. So she's made me curious enough to do that. I liked the story. Characters are developing well also as a series goes that is. But do not consider if you have a weak stomach."
1,Triptych,I have read all of her other books. I couldn't finish this book because there were just too man F words. Why is it really necessary to use that horrible word. Once or twice would have been sufficient but over kill on the word. I probably will not buy any of her other books now.
5,REALLY REALLY GOOD BOOK!!,"I have read all of Karin Slaughter's books and this is my favorite. Being from the Atlanta area the sights, sounds and characters are so very real to me that I can actually feel, taste and smell it all. As she writes, her characters continue to grow and mature and go along to the next phase of their lives. You will love some and really hate some of her recurring folks. Her writing gets dark sometimes, but it adds to the atmosphere and story lines.Not all of her books have pleased me but all of them have been engrossing reads. Ms Slaughter is a very talented writer."
5,This is a great toy!,"My 5 year old son loves this playset and plays with it a lot. The sounds are fun, and the different things it does all work well."
3,Yoko with the Plastic Ono Band,"This is Yoko doing her vocal improvs over the banging Plastic Ono Band. If Yoko isnt your thing, then this record is not for you. But the Plastic Ono Band never sounded better."
2,Gustaf Klimpt 100 drawings,I chose this rating because out of 100 illustrations 33 were so very faint that I need a magnifying glass to see anything o the page because it is so very faint. I think this book was a reject. This problem with the illustrations should have been mentioned
2,Ajnabee,I usually try to do a thorough review but this movie was just annoying and slimey more than any one thing that I hated. I've watched and read plenty of spicy to even wild plot movies and just couldn't dig this one. For believability factor I just couldn't buy that Deol would forgive Akshay just because he saved Akshay's life later. He would of beat the stew out of him and then dragged Priya away from the slime ball because at no time was she even suggested as being unfaithful. She was being stalked by the other creepy couple and I just can't see him saying oh what the heck it's all water under the bridge that you said you wanted to sleep with my wife. Let's shake and pretend it never happened...If they were all French maybe they wouldn't kill each other but they still wouldn't be friends again...2 thumbs down.
1,Don't buy this book if you have the first one.,Had I known that the book would be a complete repeat of his last book I would not have purchasted it. Only a few new paintings. I was extreemly dissapointed. The publersher should be ashamed of this product.
5,For all the time you spit in the rain,"Listen, no point reading this thing if you're not singing along to 'Always the Last To Know', he he.Askance takes on bitter break-ups, knives-through-butter guitar lines, a voice that speaks for lovers: do you wanna know more? Do us a favour, you and me, go get this album if you don't own it RIGHT NOW. We can then begin on a Dels journey together.Oh, hey, Professional Appreciator, thanks for being a fellow Dels fan. You finally understood."
1,you missed them when they were good,"del amitri's eponymous first album ( on chrysalis) was a wondreful pop record - as the reviewer in musician magazine said , these guyswere not going to sell alot of records unless they put some r & r in their tunes - del amitri wanted to be big , and they prostituted themselves to radio . Its a shame - they are good tunesmiths . Come back to the sound you had , boys!"
5,Excellent Photography of Water,"A Drop of Water is an amazing book with lots of close-up photography. The facts about water are interesting and fun to read. Walter Wick also covers areas of vapor, steam and ice."
5,"Stunning photography, highly educational, great for children or as a coffee table book","This book is outstanding! It consists of absolutely stunning photography of water droplets on the head of a pin, an egg dropped into water causing it to be displaced in a wild wave, a series of images of dye slowly dispersing on its own through a jar of water, a snowflake, frost, a spiderweb with dew, and much more.The images are beautiful and are accompanied by text explaining what's being seen. The book is highly educational, but also quite enjoyable. I would highly recommend this book to any parent or to anyone who teaches children. While I used this book with my children as part of a study of water, I could also see it as a coffee table book, the photography is that good."
5,Classic Cheese!,"Once again a must have for any HHC fan, its a classic with choons like heart of gold, forever & wanting to get high. I can't stop singing, plus it reminds me of my good ol raver days when a room full of hundreds of kids were signing along-Good times."
2,Unhappy,"I've never been a real big fan of the Happy Hardcore genre; however, I'd like to explain my score of 2 from a critical viewpoint. The problem with this CD is the fact that almost every track sounds the same. Tracks listened to seperately aren't especially bad, but when listened to all the way through, the CD is just tiresome. The keyboards are especially repetative and add little personality to the tracks. The only bright spots are the lyrics, which is pretty much the only thing that varies. Like I said, I'm not a big fan of happy hardcore, so I suppose my opinion carries little weight."
1,Yuck!,This bracelet was terrible. I sent it back immediately. Low quality. Lightweight. Light color. Overall disappointment.
4,Dr Bronner's peppermint bar soap,"good product, not quite as strong peppermint as the liquid soap but lathers good and seems to be lasting a long time."
5,"Love it , been using it everyday.","Not bad... I been using it everyday. Smells great and organic feeling... Without harsh chemicals. Highly recommended for those worried about harsh chemicals,"
1,Disappointing,"I picked up this book at a book sale, and it wasn't worth the 50 cents I payed for it. but that's about it. It reads like the author is describing a story that someone else told him, and describing it badly. The writing is patronizing, assuming we don't know how to pronounce city names like ""Lhasa"", and explaining what a crevasse is. the characters are flat, and the adventure isn't exciting. This is an example of someone who got a book just because they did something that unusual, and maybe who they knew, not on their writing abilities. I would recommend that you do not read this book. Rather pick up Colin Thurbrons ""Shadow of the silk Road"" The pages he's in china paint an infinitely better picture of China this this book does."
5,One of my favorites,I love this book! We got this for a friend named Bob for a Christmas present and it was a big hit.
5,Still Painful,"Ten years on and it is still painful to watch anything related to 9/11. However, with the way people in general tend to ""forget"" or want to be revisionist about events, this is a good DVD to have. It shows events as I can even now remember watching unfold on my television. Work stopped in my office that day and everyone gathered around the few televisions available. I held my breath in disbelief as first one and then the other Tower fell.You could not ask for a more nearly minute-by-minute, on the screen presentation. My heart still breaks when I watch the Two Towers crumble. I recommend this DVD to everyone. I didn't want it to happen to me, but 9/11 very definitely became the third personally defining moment in my life.Hopefully, with this type of programming out there, we as a people will not forget."
1,Poorly written and just plain terrible,"Being a grad student, I have used many textbooks in my life, and I can honestly say this ranks as the absolute worse one I have ever come across. The explainations either skip a lot of steps, or are so poorly worded, or both that I've given up trying to understand this book. Often, examples are not given for difficult topics. And the examples that are given are always very simple ones that help us very little in understanding the concepts. I am not exaggerating when I say this is the worst text book I have ever used. I do sincerely mean this."
4,kind of cheesy but has a good groove,"i heard this at a listening post at fnic in paris. it keeps growing on me, and was a success when i brought it to a dinner party. reminds me sometimes of atari video-game and 80's synth sounds, good dance feeling. can't say what other discs it really reminds me of."
3,Working but Rusted?!,"After checking over the bracket and some testing, it does work. Thou mine looks like it got waterlogged and then shipped out. Not what I expected from Amazon."
2,DISAPPOINTED!,"The whole story was actually pretty boring. It had it's moments, but it was the worst book I read so far on Connie Mason. The main point in the story was that Blade was being discriminated beacause he was a indian and because of this, he and Shannon could not be together. And even after they had gotten married, the discrimination included Shannon. It was more on the indian heritage of being outcasted by the white society than a romance novel. I thought Shannon and Blade lusted after each other than felt any love toward each other."
3,Great Movie - OK transfer,I love the movie but the transfer is about VHS quality. I'm assuming they didn't have a good print and just did a tape transfer.
3,Internal gear broke after only 4 hours of use,"If you want something that lasts and is repairable, you should avoid this model.I used it to trim oak and fir branches well within the size limitations it was supposed to handle. I even religiously stopped, let it cool down, adjusted the chain tension and oiled it frequently. Nonetheless, after about only 4 hours of use, the chain started 'slipping' as if some sort of clutch mechanism was not engaging. After contacting Remington, I was told the problem (a stripped gear) is internal and not repairable. Then the person clarified his statement saying it's less expensive to replace than repair it.So, if you plan to do anything more than lightweight pruning, this product may disappoint you."
1,My original Remington was much better.,"I had previously owned the Remington 8"" pole saw and used it with good results. It got damaged in an ice storm last year. After looking at what was offered, I decided to try the lighter weight 6"" saw as a replacement. The 6"" version is like a toy compared to the larger one. There is no oil system, and I found it impossible to get the correct chain tension. Amazon made it easy to return, and promptly credited my account.I then ordered a Poulan pole saw from Amazon that I am very happy with."
5,excellent product,This is an excellent timeless product. It really helps to stretch your back and adjust it without the use of force.
5,Easy to use,"The BIC Grip Stick Roller Ball Pen makes writing less of a fight between the writer and the pen. Lots of other pens require you to squeeze hard, push down hard, and end up with the impression of the pen in your fingers, just to get some ink on paper. This one writes makes writing easier and lays the ink down without turning it into a fight with the pen."
2,pass it up,"This is a disgrace to the no limit record company, there is at tops three good songs on it, ""satisfied"", which feartures Mystikal on it is probly the best song, this is not the best stuff made from skull.......this should b named ""these wicked tracks"" instead of ""these wicked streets"""
5,The perfect color guide for so many things!,This is an extraordinary color guide for design work or DIY'ers in any field. You'll be surprised at the vast range of beautiful color choices that are out there! It also great for the scrapbooker or home jewelry maker - it takes the guesswork out of color combinations and saves a lot of time. You can even use it when piecing together a wardrobe! It is small enough to stick in your purse so you can find just the right color when shopping. It's a lot easier than dragging around a painting or a pillow!
1,"""You can smell it from miles away.""","***SPOILER ALERT***If you like smelling poop stains than you'll love this.......S...........(-).........(-_-).......(__(__)... Big ol' pile.not ok.Save yourself 2 dollars and go look in your toilet and watch it for 2 hours and 5 minutes. Equal.As a wise man once said, ""wow!"""
3,Almost too warm,"Okay, this is gonna sound weird but these boots are warm to the point where mine don't breathe well...my feet are often sweaty inside them...as compared to my Emu's which are great, breathe well and are comfy. These almost feel like an entirely different kind of fleece. Also, the lining loses its fluffy fullness leaving a flat feeling inside the boot. Again, the Emu's lost a bit of the fluffy newness but still make my feet feel more cushioned but not sweaty. Not a terrible boot, but not as good as some others.I normally wear a 7.5. The 8 fit well."
1,What a waste of time,"I ordered twice, and both times received the wrong size. I was credited for the returns quickly, however. Would not deal with this company again.Bearpaw Women's Suede & Shearling 10"" Boot - Style 410 EvaThe only reason I gave one star was that I had to to be able to post this review, or it would not be able to be seen."
5,Great Shoe,Fit was dead-on and they're super soft and comfy. Like wearing slippers outside! Definitely a great value.
5,The world needs more Helen.,"I was so happy to purchase this book! I enjoy the strip very much.I was slightly disappointed that the strips are not in chronological order, rather, they're grouped in themes. It's still cool, don't get me wrong-- but it's a tease to not see the entire context of a particular stretch of storyline!"
3,Website needs better product description,ACT! 6.0 for 2004 includes ACT! For PalmOS for free. Why couldn't I have learned by reading the product description on Amazon.com BEFORE the product arrived at my house? I didn't appreciate paying for extra/unneeded copies of ACT! for PalmOS when it was included for free in the main product.
1,SAGE has done a lousy job with this product!,"SAGE will not support their products without an additional fee, and, their product is so goofy that you will need support at some point to get it to work, or to get it back to work after it locks up. This version will not run on my AMD processor based computer and SAGE's only strategy is to have me purchase their newest version of ACT! in hopes that it will run on this machine. I am looking into converting my files over to run in Outlook, so long SAGE!!!"
2,"No free support, little improvement in years","I've been using ACT! since 1990 so have a huge investment in ACT! data and customization and would be therefore be very reluctant to discontinue its use. However, I'm disappointed with how little the product has improved in these many years. The thing I protest most adamantly is the lack of phone or email support. There's no way to communicate with ACT! support without paying a very high rate. It's not a way to create a good feeling of relationship with customers, and it's frustrating to have only expensive support available."
1,"For a contact manager that works, try Maximizer.","I have Act and two versions before. Slow, slower, slowest. Hard to use, fussy and, at the moment, I can't get some of my data bases to open.So I tried Maximizer on the 30 day free trial. Yum! Not that it couldn't stand a few improvements, but... It is quick, it gives a leeetle bit more search flexibility and it comes with some data fields that are optional, but, for me, useful. With a 30 day free trial, your downside is pretty limited, and it beats the heck out of ACT! !!!Incidentally, if fewer than 1 star were a choice..."
3,Oh...let's kick it up a notch,"I was very skeptical of my beloved Ibearican series after the previous In Bed With Space showing. Well fear no more...it's back on!!Disc one is a ""get out of your seat"" type of disc with a very good track selection. Disc 2 seems on the more ""minimal"" side of things. I have yet to embrace the Minimal trend that is taking over Ibiza. Hopefully, I will start to enjoy it. For now....I need some sick bass lines and nasty drops and this cd delivers both.Overall, a good showing from the In Bed With series."
1,NOT a Christian Book,"If you are a Christian, this is NOT the author/book for you.The Bible is very clear that Satan can dress himself as an ""Angel of Light"" (2 Chronicles 11:14). This book emphasizes the focus on Angels instead of God and His Son, Jesus Christ. The very word ""Angel"" means messenger - they are nothing more or less than a creation used by God for His people.Of course, there exist demons (fallen angels) who work the will of their father (Satan). The Bible clearly states that at the end of times, many will be deceived by these supernatural events (Revelation 13:14) worked by Satan."
5,This book tells it like it is,Very insightful read. I suggest this book to the reader who has a desire to have their eyes opended about what is happeing in our churched by those we trust most
3,Good/Bad,"Psychotrance 4 starts off very well, and then gets kind of slow. Towards the middle of the cd you will find out that it gets kind of boring and slow, but as you listen to it you will get use to it. I'm use to it. The begging of the cd is the best of it!"
2,Kind of lame,"Not very challenging and not the most clever of rules. I don't really see the interest and neither did my children. Maybe 1-3 year olds would find it fun, but not older. The rules don't match up to how the game proceeds, they don't make good sense, just kind of lame and definitely run of the mill game."
3,Not very challenging,"The game is not very challenging. My daughter knows all her colours, so it reinforces the concept for her. It's cute when the bunnies pop out. We've had the toy for about one month and so far, there are no problems with its durability."
1,"Good, but short lived","Even though my Remington pole trimmer is two years old, that only translates into two days of trimming before it died. The full day of trimming in the first summer worked fine, but it is really loud. Last year it ran in spits and spurts, but I managed to finish the job. This year it woun't even start, so I am junking it."
4,Good product,Remington Pole Hedge Trimmer works very well. The pole extends your reach so that I no longer need a ladder when trimming large bushes.
1,Don't buy this item,"Junk, junk, junk. Crapped out with the only warranty option being 20 miles away and he couldn't fix any ""electrical"" problem $120 out the window."
1,BUYER BEWARE,I have had this coat rack for about 2 months now. I just went to put a jacket on it and it literally fell apart. The bottom splintered out and the feet went crashing to the ground with all my coats in tow. There is no fixing it as there are a million shards of wood on the floor. I would not recommend this product!
1,Garbage!,"I bought this product and received something ""similar"" but not the same item. Still, it looked good and I kept it. Just recently started hanging winter coats on it. We had two coats hanging on it and today, after one month of use, the base split and the leg fell off. Now, it goes to the garbage. You get what you pay for."
2,"nice looking, not sturdy at all","I must say I was really impressed when I first got the coat hanger, I had been waiting for days to get it. I was easy to essemble and looked great. It worked good for about a week and then one of the leggs broke in the middle of the wood. I thought maybe wood glue it, totally did not work and I wouldn't pay to get this item again. Great look, was not worth the money if it wont even hold 3 coats and also the hangers all broke off too :("
1,Very crappy legs,"I thought I got a good deal $15 (original price is $60), but I am totally disappointed after one day. The leg base is designed like a fragile glass. The wood is not sturdy at all. After one day use, 2 of 3 legs are split and I have to lean the whole rack against the wall! Never try this rack, or you will be like me to leave a strong negative feedback here."
4,Don't be a slob - hang it up!,"This is an easy-to-assemble coat rack that comes in three main pieces that screw together. The pegs screw on separately to the top piece. The legs, three of them, however, have no mechanism to hold them in place that I could see. Other then the weight of the unit holding them in their slots, they are a weak spot. The come loose and the unit falls over. You must get some good carpenter's glue and glue them in place. If that doesn't work, you'll have to screw or nail them in place. That is the inexplicable shortcoming of this otherwise good-looking and useful piece.Addendum: I finally got around to getting out a tube of titebond wood glue (messy stuff that it is) and glued the legs to the center pole. Voila! Perfection now. But what a design flaw."
3,More black than Cherry,"Very dark almost black. Haven't tried testing the load strength, as I just saw a review saying it breaks under load. Will update if so. Was cheap, looks okay, just darker than i expected."
1,poorly made,The arms of the coat rack lasted all of one month. The wood is splitting between the arm and the base on three of the arms. This just had occasional use...
3,Missing A Piece,"It looks good and seems to be a good quality rack, but it's missing a piece. I'm not going to send it back because it still does the job (and I don't have the time), but I will not order another one when this one fails me."
5,"Well, that was a pleasant surprise","Why can't stuff from Ikea be this simple? I was surprised by how easy this was to assemble and how sturdy it ended up being. The pieces come with screws attached to the ends, and all you do is twist. After assembling my huge entertainment center with a tiny Allen wrench, I sat back and just marveled at how intuitive this thing was. It also looks nice. I haven't really load tested it -- we have four Winter coats on one. No problems thus far; it feels solid. And again, it was just nice to put something together that had some thought behind its construction. Also, the top two tiers twist easily without being too loose."
3,works great if there is more than one coat on it,"Looks nice, easy to put together, but the moment you put a coat on it will topple over and break a hanger off. It really needs 4 legs to be a great coat tree. Other from the feet issue I still like it but wouldn't buy it again."
1,Poor quality,This item looked great but tips too easily and after hanging 2 coats on it the area surrounding one of the support legs cracked & split therefore no longer supporting the foot to hold stand upright..Very disappointing because the product was cheaply made..I feel the product should be refunded without the the hassle of repackaging and all the red tape involve as I shop online for convenience as I am limited on my ability to travel & shop..I would ask for a replacement but not if I am going to receive a product that will preform the same..
5,Beautiful Coat Rack,Would definitely recommend to friends and family. It is beautiful and does not take up much space but holds lots of jackets and coats.
1,Cost-Effective Supplement that is just too far out of date,"The price is right but it's way out of date, and the exam covers a lot that has happened since the book was published.First, let me say I have the 2009 and 2008 editions in addition to this 2007 edition. I used these books as materials for courses I taught.I cannot recommend getting this book just to have more practice questions although at a very good price used. It's way out of date and could lead to misconceptions."
1,Caution!,"While this book does have some creative merit, please be aware that you might consider portions of it inappropriate for your child(ren). The author makes use of several interesting and unsual comparisons, but crosses the line so to speak when including elephants urinating from their respective parts to depict girl/boy, elephant's rectums plugged with a cork, an elephant on fire, and a ""smart"" and ""stupid"" elephant in other comparisons. Be sure to read this book in it's entirety before purchasing it or borrowing it from a library. I would not recommend this book as a gift unless you know the recipient family VERY well and are confident they would find it suitable. I borrowed this book for our 5yr. old son. I wish I would have read it first...I wouldn't have brought it home! We also have 2 daughters ages 16yr. and 21yr. They were of the same opinion as my husband and myself."
5,Excellent Book,"I loved the connections in this book to Bible passages. It is an enjoyable read all on it's own and has a lot of ""I never thought of that"" ideas. Thank you Connie Neal!"
2,The connector hose split in less than a day,"The short hose provided with this product was packaged with tight bends, possibly resulting in the weakness that caused the hose to split within a day of being connected. Fortunately, the resulting spray was directed away from the house and was noticed within a half-hour, but if you are inclined to purchase this product, plan to invest in a replacement hose of better quality. The four-way outlet is convenient, but given the added hassle and expense of replacing the hose, I doubt I would purchase this again."
5,Ridiculously Delicious,"I'll confess that:1. I am no longer a child (per se)2. I am not a mom ranting about lead rumors, etc.3. I am a college student.4. I try not to OD (that's overdose for you younger/older people) on these, but they're incredibly delicious. I think they taste better than regular gummy bears. My peers agree.I think that this is the number 1 vitamin of all time. I am the queen of junk food, but at least I am getting my daily dosage of vitamins when I eat my gummy bears. I had to buy a bag of regular gummy bears to put next to my Gummy Vites because the first time I had these, I definitely ODed. They were just too good!!I can only hope that the reputation of these Gummy Vites continues to grow because it is well earned. COngratulations to everyone who made these happen, because the endeavor is ridiculously delicious.Good for you and good tasting? no lead?! GOOD FOR YOU!?!? more, please."
1,one other bit of info on the lead debate,"What hasn't been stated here is that the batch tested by Consumer Labs that was found to contain lead and the batches tested by the other independent labs were DIFFERENT batches. Consumer Labs had an expiration date of 2005, while the other labs' batches had an expiration date of 2006. Thus, it is totally accurate for both sides to make their claims/statements. However, lead is too dangerous an item for developing brains and bodies (and for adults, too) to take chances.If Gummy Vites had stepped up to the plate and stated that they did have a batch which had problems and that they had undertaken the strictest standards to make sure it would never happen again, then I would feel much more comfortable. But they totally denied the charges and never acknowledged that they tested different batches than the ones that were found to be ""defective"". To me that is a big lack of integrity."
3,"Someone please give us the facts - the proof, the final determination!","First, I am a little concerned that Shawn's input may be bias since it appears he works a competitor of consumerlabs.com, SupplementWatch. Second, he states that ""Further analytical testing of the Gummy Vites product, by two independent labs, showed quite clearly that there is no lead contamination."". I wish he would have provided us the testing lab companies so we can go view the results for ourselves? From what I read, the tests were against a specific batch that have expiration date of 9/05 and consumerlabs.com said they are running tests again (see: May 24th,2004 new release at: http://www.consumerlab.com/news/news_052104.asp). In any event, that was some time ago. I wish something was published on the results?Concerned Consumer,Carl"
5,very nice,"these go on very easily and stay put! I've had mine on for 2 years now when the first baby came along and just left them on for future babies. Very soft and cushioned. Nice natural color so it doesn't stand out, just blends in with the slate and stone work on the hearth!"
5,good product,"This is a good product. I am very happy with it. It does come off easily, but it goes back on just as easily."
3,Decent Hearth Kushion,"This kushion has been on our hearth for a month now. It gets the job done, but definitely doesn't remain fastened in all places. We are glad we bought it and are happy enough with it."
3,Not sire how duable this is,"One of our fireplace is very big and wide with brick sitting area. So, I have to get two sets just to cover all around it. We still keep baby away from the fireplace ourselves since he is strong and smart enough to figure out how to peel it out. But, it does cover up the sharp and hard area to avoid head on if he run into it. However, I wist the set also has more size opinion and parts to cover the haight of the fire place on both sides. Not sure if it is durable from teething. It is expensive. But, all childproofing products are too."
1,"Looks good, but USELESS.","If you are looking for a set of knives that looks contemporary and good in your kitchen (perhaps to match your stainless steel appliances) and are not intend to use them, these knives are for you. But if you want knives to be functional, look elsewhere.This is my second set. The first set was a wedding gift and after 2 months of normal usage, it became very dull and the part where the handle and blade connect, started to rust. So we exchange them for a second set, same thing happened. Water just gets in the handles. I've found that out after I washed them for the first time and later found a puddle of water around the block. So, I wipe them dry after each wash and still, rust started to appear. These knives are very easy to bent out of shape; couple of the steak knives' serrated edges went different ways after a few dinners. The tip of the long slicer broke off.Save your time and frustrations, DO NOT buy these knives."
4,Pretty doorbell - a wee challenging to install,"My husband did the install so don't have all the details on what was challenging. Part of the difficulty was it barely fit in the available slot beside the door, but he got it in. The button light is very bright. You can see it from the middle of our cul-de-sac. We have a fairly deep set-back from the road too. It really looks nice as well."
5,Nice,Very pretty doorbell botton and very good quality at an excellent price for all the details it has. Fast shipping I love it and so do my guests that ring it
1,buyer beware,Very poor quality dvd.hard to follow and just plain Strange. I typically do not like the hassle of returning items so i kept the dvd and it is collecting dust.
3,Good Start...but not quite there,"I'm sure that Ms. Erlbach was tapped by her publisher to write this book because she's a KSU grad and a prolific author of children's books. And her other books are fine..I've read a number of them.But I'm not impressed with this book.The pictures shown are out of sequence with events as they happened.Items that wouldn't change over time, such as sculptures are not shown on the illustration of the guard vs. students, in order to give the reader a sense of things as they exist today.The use of color photos in the text is hap-hazard. (Perhaps it would have even have been cheeper for her publisher to greyscale the 3 or 4 and call it a day.)With all of that said, it is the only book about May 4th 1970, available for the school and children's room markets. And even that has taken 28 years to happen! So it's a good start...but there's so much room for improvement."
2,Nice but expensive,"Really, this a nice book and cds for some slangs in English, but the cost is so high for such a book."
2,Zoorama,"If you want to learn about the animal inhabitants of Denali, this video is for you. I can't complain about the great animal shots and video quality and excellent narration but I don't need to spend an hour learning about frozen frogs, beavers birthing mooses, bears and ground squirrls!In an hour, I saw little of the majesty of the park's scenery. Nothing on how it was settled or it's people. What I got was a lot of animal close ups. I saw so much underground footage that I was becoming claustrophobic. Enough of the frozen wood frog already!!Yes, I am a lover of animals but this aspect was over done. I never saw a park ranger or saw or heard anything that would help me plan my upcoming visit to Denali.Sorry PBS! This video belongs in a High School Biology class! If you are planning a visit to Denali you will do better by surfing the net or finding a good book about the park."
3,Girl Meets Horse,"Girl meets horse. Girl looses horse. Girl regains horse. A safe romantic novel for teenage girls. Far inferior to ""Water for Elephants""."
2,Riding Lessons got to far off track,"Thought this book was going to be a good story until it got way off track into other lame stories. I use to ride horses so the first part was great, I could associate with it. Not the last 3/4 tho. Sorry."
3,I enjoyed it.,"While it was a bit predictable, I did enjoy it. Although, in my 60 years I have never seen a horse as traumatized as her horse was just flip a switch one day and trust again. Trust from horses comes in small steps, and builds. That said it was an easy read, enjoyable, and I will probably read another."
2,I had to struggle to finish it.,"If you're planning to read Riding Lessons because you loved 'Water for Elephants', you'll likely be disappointed. Thank goodness the author kept writing after this novel! I've become accustomed to horse novels being wildly inaccurate in their portrayal of the horse world, and this one is no exception. However, what is more frustrating with this novel is that I just couldn't bring myself to care about the main character, Anne Marie. Yes, she suffered a terrible tragedy, but she comes across as a selfish person who drinks excessively and lacks self-awareness to the point of pathology. One feels sorry for her child, certainly, but it's difficult to care about a story when the heroine leaves you cold."
3,Pretty good,Liked how it came along. I liked the mother daughter relationships and look forward to going horseback riding very soon.
3,Was ok,"A bit slow here and there. And also a bit unbelievable. Glad I got it ""used.Book was in great shape though"
5,Wonderful,"One of the top 5 books I've read this year. Really identified with this book. Reminded me a lot of the Horse Whisperer. This has a completely different story, but shares the similarities of an accident and a woman who believes everything she touches falls apart until the love of a horse pieces her together. This is a library book I'll definitely be buying. (Just wish the photo on the cover used a correctly colored and marked horse!)"
4,New Melanie for 2000,"This is a 5 song CD. 1 new version of ""lay down"" 3 new versions of ""ruby tuesday"" and 1 new song. It is an interesting musical expierence. The rap versions of Ruby Tuesday sounds pretty damn good!"
4,Occupant,a movie that continues to have a spin on suspense and keeps you glued to the tube. I liked this movie and recommend watching it.John.H
5,True Sounds of True Punk,"Having heard three songs on Rondelet's Punk Singles Collection Bomb Scare,Another Hiroshima,and Flower in the Gun. ""Masterpieces"" . Brilliance in lyrical point of view,although I would love to read original lyrics to make sure,, and bass/gutar/drum strums full of energy. Punk is Dead but what's alive is THE 4 P'S. Original sounds these folks have,(had),. I wouldn't call'em Yesterday's Heroes because they made MY delivery DAY just as I believed.This is a first internet order for myself and personally if this CD can be found and purchased in a shop the value is Increaseable. I respect DEAD MAN's SHADOW"
5,Great Product !! Easy To Use And Clean !!,"I received the Diaper Champ, which I had registered for,at my baby shower last year. So far, I have had no problems at all using it.I like the convenience of using my own bags and the ease of diposing of the soiuled diapers. Sure there is odor when you go to change to a new bag, but doesn't that occur with any type of diaper pail? I read several bad reviews about the Diaper Genie smelling bad and buying those refills. At least this product has easy access to clean it and the convenience of using your own bags."
4,Great product,"The diaper champ is awesome, I have never once had a problem with odor in my sons nursery. The only problem I do have occasionally is the tabs of a diaper getting stuck in the sliding mechanism, but a little jiggling usually fixes that easy enough. I love the fact that it takes regular tall kitchen trash bags, it makes it so much easier to use."
2,not so much of a champ,"it's kind of loud to use, but it was fine...until the poo started getting stinky. then the diaper champ wasn't so much of a champ. ended up getting rid of it and buying the safety 1st neat diaper disposal system and i absolutely love it. even though you have to go buy specific liners, it's worth it because our baby's room is no longer stinky at all."
5,Greatest Invention,I have a 7 month old and received this as a shower gift. This is a great product. We use scented 13 gallon trash bags and some Lysol. It doesnt smell and has a large capacity. I would say much better choice than the Diaper Genie.
2,Stinks after 3 months of use!!!,"Well, the first three months were odor free!! Then after the charcoal chamber absorbed all the odor - watch out. After the3rd month, it was intolerable!! I am going out tomorrow to purchase the diaper genie or something better!!! No matter how much you clean or how often you spray with Lysol the smell keepscoming back. And they don't have a website to complain too!"
3,so so...,"I have the diaper champ and for ease of use it gets a 5, you dont need special bags and they are easy to change. However, WOW does it stink. We have tried Lysol, diaper pail deodorizers and it still smells bad. Most of the time it is bearalbe, diapers stink you cant get around that but it really stinks when it comes time to change the bag. I am keeping it around but for my next kid I am definatly getting a diaper genie 2."
1,Smell,"I have to admit, I loved the idea of the diaper champ...in the beginning. Now, I am looking for another diaper disposal system. My son is only 1 month old..and the diaper champ is not holding up in the anti-stink department. I have tried cleaning the diaper champ according to the inserts recommendations, with no luck. I am also changing the bags way before they are full, to see if that helps...it doesn't. Whenever you walk into my sons room, all you can smell is stinky diapers. I thought maybe I had done something wrong when inserting the trash bag or closing it...nope. So now, after only 1 month...I am off to try and find a less stinky diaper pail."
2,Just okay,"This product works fine for isolating diaper odors, but overall I was disappointed. If you plan on using cloth diapers, this won't work for you. Anything other than disposables that have been wrapped up in a ball will get caught in the flipping mechanism. Then the top has to be opened and the items pulled out- negating the purpose of the whole thing. Also, the bags are a bit difficult to get out and tear if you're not super careful."
2,WHAT's THAT SMELL???,"Capacity speaking this Diaper Champ is the ""champ"", but when it comes to being odor free it's a FAR cry from that. It stinks much worse than the DIAPER GENIE. I have had both products and they both are not worth the price. A $10.00 trash can, with a couple of air freshners is a better investment."
1,Stinky Diaper Pail,"At first I thought the Diaper Champ was great, but then my sons diapers began to stink so bad- we finally put the diaper champ at the curb to go with our recycling. The Diaper Champ made my sons bathroom stink like a diaper pail- NO THANKS! We went out and bought the Diaper Genie 2- its the best - no stink what so ever in my sons bathroom. To me it is no big deal to buy the refills for the Diaper Genie 2 because I CAN'T stand nasty diaper smell."
1,Smell is terrible,"It's true, it does not work as well as the diaper genie. I am going back to that. I have used both and I can assure you, this product does not contain smells - I even put it in the closet, and still we smell it! Save yourself the money."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!!,The Diaper champ is NO champ! MY BATHROOM STINKS!! The diaper would keep getting stuck and now that there's nothing in the champ because I have stopped using it the handle still does not turn. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE!!!!!
2,This Thing STINKS,"We read all the reviews and wanted the convenience of using regular bags. After using the Champ for 1 month I have to say that it does control the odors so far.HOWEVER, it is sometimes very difficult to open it up. *Sometimes it will tip over if you don't lift the hatch perfectly.*The diapers we use are size 1 and we wrap them up tight. They STILL get stuck in the plunger. The hole is too small for the diapers to go on. I'll open it and there are 3 diapers stuck in the hole. Unless you perfectly place the diaper, wrapped super tight, they will get stuck. I can't imagine what will happen when the diapers get larger.I am disappointed overall with this product. I would like to see these concerns addressed by the company. Hope this helps!"
2,Not smell proof,"This product isn't that bad... however it is not smell proof. I love the fact that it will take any type of trash bag, but if you do not empty the pail out daily the smell leaks out into your baby's room and it does not smell pleasant."
2,Stinky!,"I bought this diaper pail because of the good online rating and the fact that I didn't have to worry about special refills--just standard garbage bags. Well, I was happy with it--until my son turned 5 months old and started eating solids. Whew! Very stinky! This diaper pail does not contain odors! I've even tried scented garbage bags and stickups. We're buying a Diaper Genie."
1,It STINKS!!!!,"I hate it!!! It is a horrible product that in no way keeps the diaper smells in. It worked fine for the first couple of months, but the diapers barely stunk then. Shortly after that, it started really stinking, I'm talking about stinking up the whole back of the house! It stunk even when it was empty! I tried cleaning it many times with bleach and changed out the gaskets twice!!! After 8 months of stinkiness, I threw it away!!! I bought it in the first place because it had good reviews and got a good review in a book"
4,Best diaper pail I have found,"I have tried numerous diaper pails and this was the last one I had to buy. I first got the Diaper Genie. That was a pain with the special refills and it was a hassle to have to turn the ""lever"" to drop the diaper in and seal it. I also had a Fisher Price pail that wasn't very good either. Same kind of concept where you had to turn a ""lever"". Then, I came across the Diaper Champ. I love it!!! You can use any regular trash bag so there are no special bags to buy. It is very easy to drop the diaper in. Just put it in the hole on top and move the handle from back to front or front to back. It is so easy that my 3 year old can do it. Very hassle free and it keeps odors contained pretty well as compared with others that I have had. Don't waste time on others when you can get it right the first time."
3,P-U,"I don't own this, but we were visiting some friends who have one in their kitchen and one in their daughter's room. I went to nurse my son in their daughter's room, and couldn't because the smell from their Diaper Champ was so horrible. It probably is fine if you clean it regularly, and when babies are breastfed exclusively (poop gets much smellier when they start solids or drink formula) but I am so glad we have the Diaper Dekor--no odors whatsoever."
3,Diaper Champ vs. Diaper Genie,"Diaper Champ cannot claim to be odorless. The Diaper Genie is much better at containing the smell but the Genie refills you have to buy become an endless expense. I like the fact that the Diaper Champ allows you to use any type of bag but anything larger than a grocery bag will leave you running for the door to escape the smell. To avoid the smell you have to change bags much more frequently than the Diaper Genie (and use Lysol regularly) but the design of the Diaper Champ has a few more bonuses. The Champ is easy to change and much nicer not to have to stick your hand down in to push the diaper down, plus you don't have the twisting or cutting of the Diaper Genie."
1,Stinky from the Start,"We were totally dissatisfied with the results from our Diaper Champ...we had a problem with odor escaping right from the start...and our daughter was breast fed exclusively for 10 months, so it had nothing to do with a change in her diet. Over time we noticed that the foam pieces of the pail do become increasingly stinky and are very difficult to clean...even bleach couldn't get the smell out!"
4,cost,the cost written on amazon is 149.99 which is way over priced. Hopefully just an error that will be corrected. This should run you around 35$. I've noticed several items overpriced on amazon so make sure you check prices on other sites/stores first before over paying!
2,Not even close to good...,"The Diaper Champ is difficult to use and does not contain the smell at all!! After you turn the handle to bring the diaper down, if there are more than a few diapers in there, it gets stuck and you have to turn it a few times to get it down. It smells pretty bad after a day or two, and this is after cleaning it with Pine Sol AND letting it air out!!The only advantage is that you can use your own bags, but what good is that if you are constantly cleaning it and spraying Lysol??"
5,BEST EVER!,"I initially requested the diaper genie for my baby shower. I had a ton of people recommend the diaper champ over the genie, but I figured it had a bigger name at the time.... WHAT A MISTAKE!!!This diaper holder is PERFECT!!! It uses ANY bags around, doesn't let any smell leak out and is so easy it can be operated with one hand. I am so glad that I bought it!!! I will use the same one for future children. It has taken a beating and is still working strong!!!"
2,Miss my Genie!,"After Our Diaper Genie broke after 2 years, I was advised to buy the D. Champ. It was highly recommended by a new mom with an infant. Big mistake, her baby as well as most of the people reviewing this positively are using it with their INFANTS, so their diapers do not smell like that of a one or two year old toddler!!!!!!!! The Genie does a much better job of masking the odors, Yes, it is more cumbersome in terms of changing out the plastic....but that I can live with. The reason I gave it two stars is the ease of use with the Champ is superior....but I simply CANT LIVE with the stinky smell of diapers!"
1,This product STINKS!,"I have been so disappointed in my Diaper Champ. It came highly recommended by a good friend, and the fact that it used normal grocery bags rather than expensive specialty bags was a huge draw. However, we have tried everything and still this pail stinks up our son's nursery. And it's not just a faint smell. The stench is so powerful that it practically knocks you down when you open the door. It doesn't matter how often we empty or clean and sanitize it, nothing seems to help. We would have to empty it after every diaper change, and that sort of defeats the purpose of having a diaper pail. Go with something different. It would be worth the extra money to get rid of the odor."
2,Okay but Neat is better,"We bought the Diaper Champ with our 1st child and used it until we had another child. It was great while he was being breast fed and wasn't that stinky but as he got older and ate a more varied diet it just stopped containing the smell. We changed the bags and wiped it out every few days and used lots of Lysol and it still smelled. Also after a while the cylinder that pushes the diaper down started to slide too far and get stuck and then it became a huge pain the drop a diaper in. Half the time you would have to tip the whole pail over or open the top to get a new diaper in.With our second child we bought the NEAT by saftey first, she is now a year and we LOVE it. It even contained the smell of our older childs diapers before potty training."
5,Excellent product!,This is so much better than the diaper Genie. Just one simple flip of the handle puts the diaper in. With no special bags. Love it.
2,After 8 months of use looking for new diaper disposal system,"When my daughter (now 8 months old) was younger, and her diapers were smaller, the Diaper Champed worked well. But now that her diapers are bigger (and stinkier) I find that the Champ only holds about 10-12 diapers before getting jammed, especially if we put wipes in it along with diapers. Another thing is the velcro on the diapers often gets stuck and it's difficult to flip the diapers into the bottom of the container. Another problem is the smell, the champ doesn't seem to contain odors any better than putting diapers into a regular trash can. I've never used any other diaper disposal container so I don't know how this one compares, but I am now looking for a new one b/c the Diaper Champ just isn't cutting it for me. Half the time I end up just throwing the dirty diapers into a waste basket to avoid the hassle."
5,Much Better than the Diaper Genie!,"While I was in the hospital on bed rest with our twins, my husband broke our diaper genie. He was frustrated putting inthe refill and didn't find the directions..anyways, I am so gladhe broke it or we wouldn't have bought the Diaper Champ! It easyto use, no more refills, you can use any garbage bag and put more diapers in it. Our 1 1/2 year old enjoys disposing ofhis diapers. It is that easy! Helpful Hint, just give it a sprayof lysol after you empty it.Mom,Dad & our three sons"
4,Love it!,"We love this! We haven't had problems with odors at all! When we first got it, just in case I put an air freshener in it, and that was almost 6 months ago! The only flaw I see is that it can be a pain to get open. Really worth it though!"
2,Don't buy it if you are using cloth diapers!,"We use cloth diapers and found the Diaper Champ to be pretty unhelpful in reducing odors. It gets clogged with only 3-5 diapers in it, which means I have to change the bag or lift the lid to unclog it a ridiculous amount of times each day. My son's room smelled better with the bin we got from the diaper service!! We're switching back and giving this away. Ingenious design though..."
2,Smells as child gets older,"The diaper champ worked pretty well until maybe our son was about 12 months or so. I think there is a seal that broke (maybe because my husband liked to try and force the diapers down and didn't make sure the sticky tabs on the diaper were secure so it would get jammed) and ever since you can smell even one diaper in it. His room always smells like a poopy diaper that was just changed, even after it's been cleaned and you've just added one diaper to it. I like the fact that you can use your own bags, but it's no longer any more effective than just a regular trash can sitting in his room with the lid up."
5,Absolutley fabulous,"Baby Luke can turn a clean diaper to a dirty diaper in 3 seconds flat. The diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into ""what diaper smell"" in less time than that. I hesitated and wondered what I REALLY needed for the nursery. This is one of the best purchases we made. The champ, the baby bjorn, fluerville diaper bag, and graco pack and play bassinet all vie for the best baby purchase.Great product, easy to use, economical, effective, absolutly fabulous.UpdateI knew that I loved the champ, and useing the diaper genie at a friend's house REALLY reinforced that!! There is no comparison, the chanp is easy and smell free, the genie was difficult to use one handed (which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad) and there was a deffinite odor eminating from the genieplus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ."
1,Pew,"I was excited to find this product and touted it to all my pregnant friends....too bad, shortly after my daughter was born I found that this contraption was stinking me out of her nursery. I am very surprised to see any positive reviews."
1,Diaper Loser!,"Bottom line-- bad odors-- and we tried two of these to make sure. I bought the first one of these, put in one dirty diaper (baby isn't even on solids yet-- on soy formula) and it smelled up the entire nursery. Thinking maybe mine was defective, I took it back and exchanged for a different one, and used scented trash bags. After 30 min., I could smell the scented trash bag when I walked in the nursery, so I figured if I could smell that, then certainly a dirty diaper would smell, too. I took it back for the second time and bought the Odorless diaper pail from Safety First, works great! I cannot understand why this product gets such good reviews. It was a waste of my time to even try it."
2,No Champ at all!,"I was attracted to this diaper pail because you did not have to buy special bags. It was great for the first 6 months before my son started eating food. Then, everything went down hill quickly! The stench that permeated my son's room was not pleasant. So, the DC is now in my attic (it was very large and unsightly as well) and I empty the trash can nightly."
1,It Stinks!,"No matter how often you change the bag and clean the thing, the diaper champ emits the odor of the smelly diaper into the room. I do not recommend this product."
2,"Works, but doesn't contain odor","After 18 months, our original Diaper Genie 2 had basically taken on the diaper smell and couldn't be cleaned anymore. With Baby #2 on the way, we decided to try Diaper Champ. Big mistake.Mechanically, it worked soundly, so no problems there. However, with every turn of the drum a ""puff"" of foul, diaper stink floated up.My decision to return it was made immediately upon opening the compartment to change the bag. The bag just sits down inside, but is wide open. The odor immediately filled the baby's room, and several adjacent ones. With eyes watering, I grabbed the bag, tied it off, then double-bagged. Fortunately, we could a few open windows and turn on a fan to disperse it.I hope I can get my money back."
5,Midlife Mom,With my first child I had a diaper genie and really liked it but had problems with the disc that cut the bags and I hated having to spend the extra money on those fancy little bags.This item is the best!!!It's really easy to use and the one handed aspect makes it great for those times when you're changing diapers and have your hands full. I also like the fact that it takes regular clear plastic garbage bags and you can fit a ton of diapers in it before it's full.If you're worried about the smell - don't. This diaper champ has no smell at all. I also find myself throwing regular garbage in it too! It's handy and works great - this is the one you MUST have!!!
4,Does the job but lacks in capacity,"I've used the Diaper Champ for 2.5 months with twin babies. It keeps the stink contained and is usually easy to use. There have been times when I couldn't flip it over, but it might be because a wipe got loose or a diaper wasn't rolled up real good (directions state the wipes cannot be placed in the compartment by themselves - just wrap them up in the diaper). My only complaint is the storage capacity which is why I give it 4 stars instead of 5. The container looks like it would hold more than it does. With twins, we are changing a 4-gallon bag once a day. I recommend an 8 gallon bag. A good thing about this container is that it can use any bag (or none if you are in a bind). I recommend the Safety 1st Pail over the Diaper Champ since it can hold more and is similar in performance."
1,Yuck!,"I read the positive reviews of this product when I was registering and decided to go with the diaper champ. Unfortunately, I did not have a good experience with it. While I changed it daily, it still smelled horrible. I used lysol on it every time I changed the bag and washed it out with soap and water frequently. It still smelled! After 6 weeks, I threw it out and used the regular garbage and took the bag out every night. Much better! Save your money and forget these diaper pails."
2,PEEE WEWWW!!!,We received the diaper champ as a gift and when my daughter was a newborn and it worked just fine...then she got bigger and so did her diapers. They were constantly getting jammed in the chute. And now that she is on solids it is not keeping the odors in at all. Every time we flip the handle we get a huge wiff of dirty diapers. So needless to say we are not using this anymore. It's great for newborns but not for older babies.
2,does not contain odors!,"I bought this instead of the diaper genie because I liked the idea that I could use my own trash bags and not have to buy refills all the time. Unfortunately, this product does not contain odors well at all! I have to change the liner ever few days AND the odor manages to stay within the can even without anything in it! You may as well have a regular open trash can in your nursery because it will smell the same."
5,The Best of what's Available,"This product is easy to use. No twisting and turning or sharp blades to cut the diaper link. No expensive refills. All that is required is a flip of the handle. I have used the Diaper Genie, but turned to this. The Genie system still smells, so will this one. The smell factor is impossible to avoid no matter what they say. I am a mother of two planning to have two more. I will continue to use this product."
4,Not stink free....,"I do like this much better than the Diaper Genie, especially how easy it is to put the dirty diapers into the pail. HOWEVER... it is definitely not odor free! We have had to resort to putting poop diapers in a Sassy ""diaper sack"" before putting them in the pail. That is the only way to not have to change this pail every other day. Now, I can get away with changing out the pail every 4-5 days or so. Otherwise.. a nice pail, much easier to use than the diaper Genie and toddler proof!"
1,disappointed in diaper champ,"We purchased this because it did not require special refill bags. Also, we had heard it worked really well, & was odor-free. We have had a VERY difficult time with the odor. I wipe it down with a cleanser in between bag changes, & this does not help at all. I've tried placing the diapers in small bags before placing them in the diaper champ. That hasn't helped either. This product is comparable to a regular trashcan & isn't worth the money it costs."
5,Wonderful! never had a problem,"I don't know what these people are talking about when they say it smells. I never had a problem. Whenever I change the garbage bag, I spray some lysol or febreze and that's it.I can't imagine myself spending money to buy refills for a diaper pail..."
5,Works wonderfully!,"We originally registered for the Diaper Genie. I sent an email to several of my friends asking their opinion and 8 of 9 told me that they hated the Genie because it was difficult to use. One even called it the Diaper Demon. Another friend of mine, a grandmother, told me she would buy this for our gift because her daughter had such great success with it. We love it! There was only a quick snap on for assembly and it was ready to use in about 60 seconds. I wrap my diaper tightly before tossing them in there and haven't had an odor problem. I typically change the bag twice a week on trash days. It is very easy to use, even while holding the baby. I do agree that it is harder to get open but I am hoping that will be a deterrant to a little girl when she starts tooling around soon! I love the fact that I can use regular trash bags and sometimes even buy the scented kind. I have recommended this product to several friends who also love it."
2,Smelly Diaper Pail,"I first bought this item because I liked that you could use regular garbage bags. I loved this product until I started my child on solids, then it was useless. It always smelled and I couldn't keep it in my babies room. I went and bought the new improved diaper genie, and I don't smell a thing."
5,One of the best things I have!,"I bought the diaper champ when my son was born. He's now 8 months old and I still love it. It uses regular trash bags, which is very convenient. My husband takes the trash bag out about once a week now. At first, he only had to take it out every 2 weeks.We have really enjoyed having it and I'm getting one for all my friends who are pregnant now. Some of the reviewers have written that it smells, but I haven't had that problem at all. Matter of fact, the changing table butts up against it and the glider that I use daily is less than three feet away. I have rarely smelled anything, and if I do, that means it's time to take out the trash. This is one of the items that I think should be on every registry! Operating it is really easy and the same applies to emptying it."
4,Works for us,"While not prefect, I have had trouble using friends Diaper Genie too. It is nice not having to buy special bags for it. Does not totally contain the smell when our little dear starteed producing more stinky... packages, but again I am told none of the competitors meet up to their claims either. Sometimes diapers can get stuck in in the opening and make it hard to flip over, especially if it is getting full, but that is the worst downside I have seen to this pail. All around excellent and economical."
2,Could be better,"I like the slim shape and that you can use regular tall kitchen bags with the Diaper Champ. BUT, it really isn't that great in controlling odor. Sometimes diapers get stuck in the ""flipping tube"" and then you have to open it and pull it out... what a mess! It isn't all that easy to clean either."
1,Smells after a while,"There are a lot of reviews on this site mentioning the fact that this thing smells after a while. I wish I listened to them. I used it ok for 2-3 months, but am now using my regular garbage can and emptying it each day. The diaper champ would smell tons worse than my garbage can, and believe me that smells spreads! I suppose it's not a true air-tight system. You might be able to find a garbage can that is."
5,Great product!,I decided to register for this diaper pail mainly because of the fact that it didn't require special bags. My baby is now almost 6 weeks old and we are really happy with it. You can use regular kitchen garbage bags and our nursery doesn't smell at all. It's very easy to use.
2,lacking stink control,"I nannied for two babies in some one else's home and they have the Diaper Champ. I think the reason parents don't smell the diapers when using this product is because they get used to the smell!! I would think that the poopy diapers were fine in this diaper pail until the parents would come home and ask why it smelled so bad in their house! Finally, I had to start using the ""champ"" for wet diapers only and walk the poopy diapers out to the street garbage can. Although I'm sure that this is better than throwing the diapers in your house garbage, there has to be something with some better odor control!"
2,"Cheaper, but smells","We bought this when our 6 year old Diaper Genie broke. We had a 2 1/2 year old and a newborn still in diapers. With the older child's diapers, the smell was pretty bad. It was nice to use kitchen bags instead of buying the more expensive Diaper Genie bags, but once the child gets old enough, it just doesn't cut it because of the smell. We bought a new Diaper Genie, and they have made some great design improvements in the past 6 years! The smell issue is solved, and it is much easier to use than our old Genie. If you have an infant, the Diaper Champ will probably work for you, but it won't last like the Diaper Genie."
4,Cost Saver,"As new parents, we have found it truly amazing how much money goes for all the little extras--batteries, film, pacifiers, wet wipes, etc. This is one reason I passed up the diaper genie, which although is a great product from what I've heard, requires the frequent purchase of refills which can be complicated to install. So we decided to go for the Diaper Champ, which just requires normal trash bags which you're going to buy any way. On the whole, it's worked well. To diminish the likelihood of bad odors in the nursery, one should change the bag frequently, before it gets full. The one problem is the mechanism it uses to ""roll"" the diaper into the champer often gets stuck if you use diapers with sticky tabs--velcro diaper tabs, no problem. Overall I like this product and I like not having yet one more expense like refills."
2,Not a champ!,"I am a new mom of a 6 month old. I had a diaper Genie that was purchased used from a garage sale before my son was born. At my baby shower I received a Diaper Champ. I was very pleased with the diaper genie I had, but this Champ, (NOT) was brand new & I heard such rave reviews about it, so I threw away my perfectly fine diaper genie. What a mistake!!! My son's room smells horrible everytime I change his diaper, and the smell never goes away. I have to open his bedroom window to air it out daily in the dead of winter! I received this as a gift 4 months ago and since then I've been so upset I threw away my Diaper Genie. I was so fed up one day I ran out to the store in my pajamas and purchased a Diaper Genie. No more smell. Don't purchase the ""Champ"", you'll end up switching to Diaper Genie which is $10.00 cheaper and better!"
2,The smell is definitely there...,I was at an open house this weekend looking at a home I might buy...you could smell the diaper pail through out the entire house. It was really strong when you were in the baby's room.They had this diaper disposer. I finally suggested to the listing agent that she might try putting some baking soda in it because everyone is going to think the problem was with the carpet!
3,Inexpensive but not perfect,"We received the Diaper Champ as a shower gift. It worked great for the 1st 5 months. As our baby started eating solids at 5 months, and having smellier diapers, the Diaper Champ did not keep the odors completely in anymore.It is inexpensive since you can use whatever bags on hand to refill, however, you will occasionally have bouts of odor that eminate from this diaper pail."
2,Not worth it.,"Thought I was being clever buying one that didn't need special bags. But it's too big & cumbersome to use. You will have difficulty rotating the top to make stuff go down. Once baby's a few months old- forget it! Too much trouble as you're wrestling with baby. Nobody but me ever bothered (mom, husband), so I'd always come in to find there would be diapers sticking out the top. The seal broke after about 2 weeks. You will get stuff stuck in it. Looks great, but it isn't. Bought a small commercial grade foot operated can and it works much better. Doesn't hold as much but then too much is kind of gross when you think about it!!! Good luck!"
1,This Product Stinks (literally),"I thought that the convenience of not having to use special bags would make this product great. Unfortunately, this product does not help keep the odor away like the Diaper Genie."
1,Great for newborns bad for toddlers,I really loved the ease of using the Diaper Champ - unfortunately when I my son started eating solid foods - the Diaper Champ just didn't keep the smells from invading my whole house - Yuck! Nice try Diaper Champ - sorry I had to sell mine in a yard sale when my son was 10 months old and go buy a Diaper Genie - a product not without flaws itself - but at least it keeps the smells to itself.
2,You have to clean daily! Or PU,"I just read the review of the lady who went on and on about people who have complained about this product that she loves. I did not like the diaper champ. I know it holds dirty diapers; but I didn't know you would have to clean it every day just to mostly keep the smell out. I finally had to resort to putting every diaper in a plastic bag before putting it in and then taking it out every night. (Easier for home owners. I had my baby in the winter and lived in a condo where the trash was far.) My husband could never get it open. It is a two handed job; who's got a new baby and two hands? I have a friend who had it too. She hates it as much as I do. She said it was easier to run it to the garage every time, then to use the diaper champ.When I was a nanny they used the diaper genie. Wow, I must be picky because I think that is worse. I hope to find a better diaper pail before the next one comes."
3,TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE despite a decent product,"I bought a Diaper Champ and mostly love it - except that the rubber ring at the top keeps popping out of alignment therefore making it next to IMPOSSIBLE to turn. I thought Baby Trend would have a simple solution for this - a replacement rubber ring, but no. They won't even return my 3 messages and one email and every time I call the customer service number to speak to a real live human, no one answsers. No one."
3,Poor Quality Control,"I have no doubt that my wife and I will be happy with the Diaper Champ (our first baby is due in two weeks). But we have had to expend quite the effort to find one that actually works. The first Diaper Champ that we bought had a piston that would not drop (the plastic joint did not meet and thus caught the piston on its way down). The replacement Diaper Champ's piston moved just fine but the drum would not flip over easily. It took two hands and a foot securing the bottom of the can to the floor to get the drum to turn. This is not one handed operation as the box states. After a third trip to the store we finally found a Diaper Champ that works. And you do not even need to ask. Yes, it was made in China."
4,A great diaper pail,"This diaper pail is great. It is the third one that I have tried. I just wish that I had it 4 years ago with my first child. It is very easy to use. You don't need special liners or refills. A regular garbage bag works fine. I had the Diaper Genie and it didn't keep odors out. The Diaper Champ doesn't totally keep odors away, but it works just as well if not better than the others I have tried. The diaper champ is very easy to use. You only need one hand to ""operate"" it. My 2 year old loves ""helping"" out and can independently use it."
5,A must have nursery accessory,"I have two of these, one for each of my twins nurseries. I must say that they are the best things I received for baby gifts. The best thing is that you use it with regular kitchen trash bags. With those diaper genies, you have to buy special inserts that cost [money] for each trash bag, and they are really difficult to opperate with one hand. With the Diaper Champ you just fold up the diaper insert it into the cylinder and flip the handle. It couldn't be easier. I'm not sure why some other folks say that they smell...mine don't. Maybe they are not rolling and closing up the diapers before putting them into the cylinder. I'm sure the stool would get on the cylinder head and cause a smell, but I don't have that problem."
1,"Sorry Champ, Time to Retire...","We set up changing stations upstairs and downstairs before our little one arrived, and decided to experiment -- Champ upstairs, Genie downstairs. What we quickly discovered is that the Champ is simply not as sanitary. There is no way every diaper can be completely sealed before going into the Champ, so this results in unfortunate smears down the chute into the garbage bag, and on the piece that klunks when you turn the handle over. [Almost completely] impossible to clean. It is possible to clean - but you have to take the thing apart, with difficulty, and is that really how you want to spend your time every few days with a newborn in the house? Yes, the Genie refills are more $ than garbage bags, but I bet your time is worth more! Best wishes with your baby/babies!"
1,tossed out the diaper champ,"I feel bad that I purchased this product only to throw it in a landfill...regrets. It is a terrible product. It jams all the time, which requires two hands (a safety hazard while changing a baby).I now use a garbage can with a lid and change it frequently--a much simpler solution. Don't buy this big plastic piece of junk."
2,Bearable with a little creativity...,"I read alot of reviews before getting this item. I don't understand how it's supposed to NOT smell when you empty it - there's no type of seal or whatnot. My baby girl is only two weeks old and I dread the really stinky toddler diapers so I came up with a workable solution. I put her diapers (especially the stinky ones) into Ziploc sandwich bags and drop them in. Seals in 'freshness'. :) It's an extra step, but well worth it. With my extra solution, it seems to be working rather well."
2,NOT A FAN OF THIS ONE!!!,"LET ME START BY SAYING THAT THE CONVIENCE OF THE PAIL IS GREAT, AND UP UNTIL MY DAUGHTER WAS ABOUT 6 MONTHS IT WAS OK! BUT NOW THAT SHE IS EATING SOLIDS, UUUGHHH! WAIT BEFORE EVERYONE GETS ALL DEFENSIVE, I CHANGE THE PAIL ABOUT ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK OK MAYBE I COULD CHANGE IT MORE OFTEN BUT LET ME TELL YOU IT STINKS!!! I HATE IT! I HAVE EVEN SOAKED THE PAIL IN BLEACH THEN AGAIN IN AMMONIA AND THE STINK WILL NOT COME OUT! I HAVE TRIED SCENTED BAGS, I HAVE TRIED GLAD TRASH WITH NO LUCK! ALSO, I CONSIDER MY SELF NEROTIC ABOUT BEING CLEAN SO I WILL END WITH THIS FOR NEWBORNS IT IS GREAT, THE CONVIENCE THE ODOR, BUT NOW FORGET IT!!! GOOD LUCK AND CONGRATS TO ALL THE NEW PARENTS! :)"
5,Better than sliced bread,"This is much better than the diaper genie. There is only 2 steps to putting the diaper in it, put the diaper in the hole on top and flip the handle to the other side. You can use this one handed. My family members got the diaper genie and stopped using them because you had to use both hands."
2,"Works for a few months, hard to use with large diapers","Gets stinky after a few months, the seal on the piston doesn't seal anymore. Also, diapers and wipes get stuck in the grove below the piston. Large diapers have to be wrapped tightly. I gave up and got a diaper Dekor. Much more hands off and takes any size diapers. Also much less stinky. Don't buy the diaper champ. You will be sorry after a few months."
3,Good at first BUT,"I purchased the diaper champ because I liked the idea of using regular trash bags. I read the reviews and thought it was a good product. At first, it was great. I would occasionally need to pick it up and drop it hard to get the stopper to drop but that was all the trouble I had. When it came to emptying the champ, it was all I could do not to add my own biological contents inside the bag. Once my son grew to 3 months and was producing smellier diapers, the thing began to stink. We would empty the champ at least every 3 days and it didn't help. I just went out and bought the diaper genie and I LOVE it! What a cool idea to never have to touch the diapers after disposal."
5,simply put,"To put it simply, this is a necessary item for every home with a baby..-no refill bags (tip--can store extra empty bags inside in the bottom)-easy to empty & clean-no odors-not big & bulky"
4,"Diaper ""Champ""????","We purchased our diaper champ because of all the excellent reviews it received on this website. Unfortunately I think people write these reviews before they have put products through the paces. We didn't have any problems with our Diaper Champ for the first 4 - 5 months of using it. We cleaned it regularly and changed the bag twice a week or more. After our daughter was introduced to solid foods this changed. We tried changing the bag more often, and at times I even put baking soda in the trash bag before putting it in the diaper champ. I have cleaned it with soap and water and bleach (not according to instructions). There is nothing you can do about the smells that come from the ""Champ"". I even wrote the company and had them send me new foam gaskets to try to alleviate the problem. Bottom line is we still use the Diaper Champ, but we keep it in the garage. It is very unhandy, but it keeps our house from smelling."
4,Pretty good,"I love this compared to the Diaper Genie I had before. I felt like I had to read the instructions everytime I had to change the cartridge. I also didn't like buying the special bags. This works great. Though it is not completely odorless, it is easier to use and I can buy any 13 gallon bags to put inside. It saves me ALOT of money!"
1,It's smells,"The diaper champed worked well for 4 months. Once we introduced cereal to our baby, the diaper smelled stronger. The champ did not stay 'odorless' as they state. I have heard from other parents who have experienced the same issue. The baby's room had an odor as soon as you walked in. This is after we scrubbed it down."
2,Diaper Champ,"I bought the diaper champ because I didn't like the diaper genie. The Diaper Champ is larger easier to use and empty, But when it came to the smell, it failed. It is not as bad as if I were to throw the diapers in with the regular garbage, but the area all around the diaper champ has a constant odor."
4,THE PERFECT PAIL,I researched all the diaper pails as this is my first baby and this was definately worth the money. We have never had an odor problem in the 4 1/2 months we have used it and not having to buy refills or remove sausage style diapers has saved valuable time and money. I highly recommend it and would definately buy again.
3,Money saver BUT I agree it does smell!!!,"This is a money saving product since you avoid having to buy those plactic bag refills. I too, use to have it in my bedroom but moved it to the bathroom because the odor would leak out. My son is a year now and eating solids, therefore those poo-poo diapers are getting really bad. Even though you change the plastic bag every 2-3X a week, if you put a poo-poo diaper in there you will smell the odor. Well thats my experience, hope that helps."
5,Love it !!!!!,"The Diaper Champ is wonderful! My son is now 7 months old an I still have no smell. I change the bag at least one time a week if not more. I love that I don't have to buy expensive bags, I actually use the cheapest bags I can find. The handle does tend to get stuck when the pail is full, but it is just a sign that I need to take it out. Overall it is probably the best baby item I have purchased!"
3,This is my second review - 8 mos later,"I initially wrote this past August about how great this diaper pail was. I'm a bit less enthusiastic about this now. It's not that I hate it. I still like it and still use it - and will continue to use. BUT it does NOT hold the smell. After a nice big BM from my sweet (but smelly) son this container will reek! It also seems to hold onto the odors even when the bag is clean. We now buy ""stick up"" air fresheners and stick then inside this item just to minimize the offensive smells.I do like the fact (still) that I can use any bag with the diaper champ. But, to be honest, I've never smelled bad odors from any of my friends using Diaper Genies. Maybe I just didn't notice, I don't know. All I know is that my Diaper Champ smells!"
3,Bigger Does Not Always Mean Better,"I was tempted by the economics of it because there are no expensive refills to buy. And because of the ease of operation. And because of its large capacity, I wouldn't have to empty it as often. The reviews I've read claim it is odor-free, but they all seem to be written by parents of newborns and young infants.I know from experience with a Diaper Genie and a toddler, the longer the pail goes unchanged, the more it will stink. Using plastic shopping bags from the grocery store (tricky) helps because the pail gets emptied frequently. But in time, plastic will take on the odor of what you put in it. The champ is not as easy to clean as the Diaper Genie.And, because it is larger than the Genie, it really sticks out like a sore thumb. Not attractive.For odor control, inobtrusive appearance, ease of use and maintenance, I will go back to the Diaper Genie. It'll mean buying refills, but you really do get what you pay for."
2,"No smell, no capacity","The first thing this product is meant to do is suppress the smell of diapers. Our son is only 5 weeks, but the Diaper Champ does seem to prevent smells from getting out.But.After the third diaper in the bag, the Diaper Champ jams constantly. Only the most tightly bound and compacted diapers then have a chance of not jamming the mechanism, and even then it's a 50/50 shot. The result is that we often wind up opening the whole top to get the diapers in, which totally defeats the purpose of the item.Not recommended."
5,The best shower present I recieved,Just wanted to add my praise of the Diaper Champ. It is so easy to use and I really like the fact that I did not have to buy any refills. There is some smell when replacing the bag but I think that is to be expected since is is afterall a diaper pail. This product has been especially helpful becase I have two dogs who find the smell of dirty diapers very interesting. I never have to worry about them getting into the diaper champ and making a huge and disgusting mess. This is a wonderful product.
4,Great product... not large enough for cloth diapers,"I love this product. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is b/c I use cloth diapers and diaper covers, and it doesn't have a whole lot of room for this type of diapers. It lasts me about 2 days.... 3 if I really stretch it.It has no odor, other than when you open it, but that is inevitable.Infact, the Babies R Us in my area uses this product in their ""mother's room"". That seems to say alot!And the best part is that its cheapest over the long run... no special bags to buy... what a pain that seems to me. I use plain old garbage bags... or even very large shopping bags.Great product."
5,Definitely the Champ,We originally registered and received the safety 1st pail- what a disappointment. the latch never worked- we purchased this pail and what a wonder! my busy toddler can't get into the diaper pail and it really works well with controlling odor (hint- use the scented garbage bags and little blue diaper sacks for smelly poops). I have recommended this pail to all my friends and they love it as well!
4,Best Diaper Pail Out There,"I love my Diaper Champ. My son is 3 months old and we have had a great experience with it. It's simple to use and is cost efficient. The biggest plus to this diaper pail is that you can use any plastic bag you want. As far as some people saying it smells, I haven't had a problem. Once a week I soak it with Lysol and water to keep germs away. I highly recommed this product if you want a clean, simple, and convenient diaper pail!"
5,Glad we decided on this one.,"I was going to register for the Genie and then I saw reviews for the Diaper Champ. It is easy to use and you don't need special bags. It really keeps the odors in. I was skeptical at first, but now that the warm weather has set in, I am still satisified.I would am glad I chose the Champ."
2,Didn't Last Long........,"Our Diaper Champ worked well for about 14 months-then the handle well, for lack of a better word, broke off. Also, the smell does get bad even when you clean it regularly. Nice to have, but not a must-have."
3,Really good.... for awhile,"I registered for the Diaper Champ based on a recommendation from a friend. It's was great at first... used regular trash bags... very easy to use, but then as time passed it got harder and harder to keep it smelling clean. I think the plastic really absorbs odors. I cleaned it out everytime I emptied it. I tried sprays, cleaning products, baking soda, even bleach, but nothing could keep it smelling good. After a year, it threw it out and bought a Diaper Genie which isn't perfect, but better."
1,Works as well as the Genie but still GROSS & POINTLESS!!,"Here is a 3 step plan to save your money on either of these ""pails"" AND on the bags. AND keep a cleaner house at the same time.1. Put the dirty diaper in an old Wal-Mart or other grocery bag.2. Twist and tie the bag tightly. Repeat if really bad.3. Walk the bag out to the trash outside if it smells really bad.Total Cost $0.00.Remember only you can prevent your house from being a LANDFILL!"
1,We like to call it the Diaper Chump!,"I would agree with a previous reviewer, Matthew. While the bags are cheaper because you can use your existing trash bags. The assault on your nose when you go to empty it almost blows you over, paticularly if its the summer and the room its in doesn't have AC. When we would empty it - we would take it outside first and then leave it oustide, open overnight. Not worth the savings in bags."
2,Works well for the 1st year...,"My Diaper champ worked well when my baby was young, but it just can't hold in stinky toddler diaper odor. Even if you deodorize it after each emptying, it will start to really smell after about a day of use. I do like the fact that you don't have to use special refills, and this has kept it in our household, but I am really looking for an alternative..."
2,Easier to use but tradeoff for increased stench,"When the old Diaper Genie was discontinued, we purchased the Diaper Champ because we were told by a salesperson that it was odorless like the Genie. We liked the fact that we could dispose of diapers with one hand and could use any garbage bag instead of costly refills. We do not like the smell that seems to linger around the champ. I guess the smell find it's way around the plunger. Bottom line is it really is easier to use, but DEFINITELY not odor free. I would not recommend this product."
3,Smelly!,"We bought the diaper champ when we were about to have our second child and were tired of paying for the diaper genie refills. The diaper champ does save you on refills because you can use standard kitchen bags but what it doesn't do is contain the odor. I ended up emptying it much more often because it made my whole upstairs smell like dirty diapers. As soon as our oldest went into underpants, I got out the diaper genie and gave away the diaper champ. Not worth the money"
1,Not worth even one star--this product stinks,I bought the Diaper Champ because I like the idea of re-using grocery bags. But it does not work for poopy diapers. If I put one poopy diaper in the whole room smells immediately. This is a terrible product and I can't believe that other people have given it positive reviews.
4,Cost Saver,"As new parents, we have found it truly amazing how much money goes for all the little extras--batteries, film, pacifiers, wet wipes, etc. This is one reason I passed up the diaper genie, which although is a great product from what I've heard, requires the frequent purchase of refills which can be complicated to install. So we decided to go for the Diaper Champ, which just requires normal trash bags which you're going to buy any way. On the whole, it's worked well. To diminish the likelihood of bad odors in the nursery, one should change the bag frequently, before it gets full. The one problem is the mechanism it uses to ""roll"" the diaper into the chamber often gets stuck if you use diapers with sticky tabs--velcro diaper tabs, no problem. Overall I like this product and I like not having yet one more expense like refills."
1,Not as great as it seems,"I got the diaper champ before my first baby was born in September, 2002. I thought it would be a great alternative to the diaper genie since it uses regular trash bags. It worked great when my daughter was an infant. But, once she started eating more solids and the poo starting smelling more it was awful. There was always an odor and my daughter's room began to smell. We decided to get rid of it and buck up for the Diaper Genie. I've been so pleased with it, well worth the money and the refill film goes further than you'd think. I'd skip the Diaper Champ and go for the true winner: Diaper Genie."
2,Great first 5-6 months,"This was great for first 5 months of my baby girl. But now that she is eating solids the odor is escaping out and we are constantly using airfreshner. First 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor. Bottom line if you buy this for your newborn, it is fine. But be prepared to buy something else (diaper genie ?) which can trap the odor better.I am now looking at the diaper genie."
3,It works ok I guess,It does contain most of the odors but not all. It is however a huge hassle to open so beware if you value your manicures. It will save you money on refills so that's a plus.
1,Useless for cloth diapers,"This is advertised as being compatible with cloth diapers. It is not. 90% of the time a diaper gets stuck in the mechanism, and you have to lift the whole top off to detach the stuck diaper, completely defeating the whole purpose. In addition, it fills up after only a few cloth diapers. Might work well for disposables, but stay away from this one if you use cloth diapers."
4,Best diaper pail and a money-saver too!,"I love the Diaper Champ! Everyone I knew had the Diaper Genie but had to buy expensive refills and did not like all the twisting involved. After reading reviews of the Diaper Champ, I put it on my baby registry and I am glad I did. It is easy to use, keeps odors contained, and uses regular trash bags (much cheaper than diaper pail refills).It was a little tricky to open the first few times because I wasn't sure how the latch worked. Also, be sure the tabs on soiled diapers are secured to the diaper or they will get stuck up under the cylinder on the way down."
3,Think carefully before you buy,"The manufacturer's package insert states that if you return this item, it cannot be resold and will go directly to the landfill. (This may be true of all diaper disposal systems, but this was the first I'd heard about it.)While it seems like the Diaper Champ might work well enough, I'm concerned that the chute where diapers are dropped will be difficult to clean. There's a round weight that moves back and forth inside this chute, and it seems to me a dirty wipe could easily soil the outside of the chute and the outside of the weight (the part that slides along the chute). This part of the Champ would be really difficult to clean. I'd rather stick with our small, lidded trashcan. I feel guilty about returning it, though...I may have to freecycle it instead."
2,A bloody Shine!,"For graphics, this animate is the best that I have seen of Manga. Were cartoon meats CG combined. I think they put a lot of effort in the CG and the cartoon animation here and the two work great together. But the story is short and the plot lacks originality in ""Blood The Last Vampire"". But this movie is still Worth adding to your collection for five bucks!"
4,Short trip to Animae Heaven,"the ONLY reason I couldn't give it 5 stars was the shortness of it (47 minutes) and a problem that won't affect you if you order it here, (I got my copy in Chinatown in San Francisco..so the Menu wasn't in English either) but I got used to it and the story is wonderful...you ALMOST don't even need subtitles...I hate bad English dubs at first I looked wondering if I had screwed up the settings but noticed the words actuallyt matched the lips moving (yes in a cartoon!!!) At first I had mixed feelings about it but as time went on it made more and more sense an American Base in Japan (off base Japanesse was spoken...on base, English) made the already realistic CGI-based animation even more realistic.....like I said though due to it's brevity, charactor <sp?> development could be better....but at the costs of the animation I could see why it was so short....some scenes I REALLY had to look HARD to tell it wasn't photograph footage..."
3,"Good, but too short","...I was looking for something that's not like everything else, and for me, this was certinaly it. Blood takes place right before the Vietnam War, and is about, well you really don't know what it's about. There's a girl, Saya, who is the last remaning original (aka: she's a Vampire), and she kills demons. That's about it. No charector development, no plot. Some people would be discusted with this, but it made me want more. I've already orderd the novels to find out more.The animation is superb. It is one of the best animation mixes of 2D and 3D that I've seen. The sound is good on surround. From the opening scene, when the train passes from the back of the scene to right in from of you, you can hear it approaching. The score is very good as well.For those that want to increase their anime collection, this is a good buy. I would never regret buying this. And if you don't like it, you can always sell it..."
3,"Eh, I've seen worse","Like everyone else I was dissapointed that it wasn't longer. Of course, due to my dyslexia I thought It was 84 instead of 48. but anyway, I must say that it was entertaing. If they had stretched it out to 2 hours I'd would have said better than Akira. Ok, blaspahmy but really, its very integing."
5,Really great.,"I have heard alot of bad reviews for this movie and I simply don't understand why.. I found it extremely good. Infact the only real complaint I can come up with is the fact that it's only about 48 minutes (including credits). The animation is top notch, the music is great, it's very dark and violent. I also like the plot too.. Definitley not your typical vampire story. Although alot of things are left unclear at the end, I like coming up with my own conclusion. But anyways, it's a safe bet you will enjoy this movie is you like animes such as Vampire Hunter D."
2,What a piece of dribble and short!,"Don't be tricked by the cool cover of this movie. The movie itself is anything but cool.Ok ok. dont get me wrong, i KIND OF liked the mix of digital and regular animation stuff, and because of that i am giving it two stars instead of only one.But the animation DOES NOT! make this movie worth buying. It is EXTREMELY SHORT, and the story is so boring and poorly told that it is not worth your time or money."
4,Short but Sweet,"As a fan of 'One Tape Anime' I thoroughly enjoyed Blood - The Last Vampire. The animation is superior in quality, with the CG not being blatently obvious. The fact that the movie is partially done in English is thrilling - and I mean that it's not dubbed, but that the voice actors were picked for their ability to be bilingual. This puts a new spin on what vampires are and how they operate. I do hope they put out a sequal."
4,Did I miss something?,I'd like to say I thought the production on this feature was exceptional! Not a bad story but def. eye candy when compared to most animes. I'm not a HUGE anime fan but I really dug this.But this is my question and someone PLEASE help me out here.It said the running time was 83 minutes...including credits my DVD player clocked 48....I noticed someone on here said something about 40 minutes as well.Did I TOTALLY miss a second part or did they just happen to double the length on the box listing just to make it seem like it was worth paying the money for?Someone please reply to me and let me know if I'm missing something. I'm a bit lost on this one. Thanks!Hopefully my email is on my user profile.Thanks guys.
2,2 1/2 - Such an anticlimax!,"Blood is a fascinating, beautifully animated short tale with a cold sterile atmosphere and seductive intricate imagery. It builds up a rivoting, mysterious storyline with a strong climax... and then it pretty much ends. I don't know why it's so short but they 'unfinished' story had potential to continue. I was just starting to get sucked into it and when the credits started to roll, I assumed there were two parts. No, there aren't. That's it. Maybe this was an experimental pilot for a planned series or feature film. If not, it's pretty disappointing that it's so short."
1,dumb dumb dumb dumb dumb,I've just gotten into anime and what had drawn me in were the originality of the stories. There is absolutely no suspense. Its just one bit of violence after another. Don't bother with this stupid movie. Its a total waste of time.
2,Blood thicker than water...though not better,"The latest release from Manga has killer hype behind it. Production IG (from Evangelion fame) and the creators of ""Ghost in the Shell""...going to be top notch, right? I'm glad Sputnik7.com ran the stream from it. It's more of a rental, show off to your friends-type movie than anything else. Nothing remarkable or substantial is presented (sans the visuals), the story is ok at best, and the extras are non exsistant. Best bet is to 1) Rent it, 2) Buy into the hype (as in get Ghost in the Shell or Evangelion), or 3) Just get Blue Sub 6. Sure it's more, but at least it's more enjoyable to watch as oppose to this."
2,Falls short of the effort,"I rented this anime, due to the fair to poor ratings other reviewers gave this DVD and I'm glad I did. The production values and artwork are excellent, but a movie they do not make.The story line always left you wondering whats going on and why. You learn toward the end of the movie (sort of) who the characters are, but not why they are. You learn that they're hunting demons, a weak reference is made to their affilliation with some governmental agency.The movie begins by placing the viewer somewhere in the middle of a story already in progress, but when it reaches the end, there really isn't an end. The movie leaves you to fill in the holes yourself.If you enjoy this genre of anime, I highly recommend the book this movie is based: Blood The Last Vampire 2002 by Benkyo Tamaoki, available through Amazon.com at a great price."
3,This isn't for the mindless...or is it?,"When I first saw this movie I saw veiled references to a certain anti-American sentiment, especially regarding the US bases in Okinawa, but others may differ in their opinion. I kind of interpreted it in that fashion because of the attitudes certain scenes depicted in regards to the Japanese versus the Americans.The plot itself, however, leaves you wanting for more (I was a bit unsatisfied at least), especially since there isn't much more from the storyline that you can draw from. Certainly, this movie was an advancement in the fact that they used 3D animation (shown clearly by the first few scenes in the train) for the background, and this is something revolutionary for its period. But much has changed, and better series have been made since its production.I would suggest the Hellsing series as something better if you want better vampire plot, much smoother animation, and something to talk about."
4,Very awesome,"This movie may be short, but it's pretty awesome in the animation and the nice attempt at trying to make 3D backgrounds and objects move smoothly with the hand drawn animation. The first 5 minutes of the DVD will just blow you away!But then it's also the reason why I didn't give it 5 stars. The action at that point gets a little confusing. I lost track of the main characters movements when she was going to attack. Other than this little stumble, the rest of the movie is pretty cool. Awesome hand drawn animation. At a couple points you can't tell whether the scene is hand painted or it's a 3D modelled.If you're a lover of Anime, this modern piece of work should give you a good idea of what to expect in the quality of anime in the future."
2,A very mixed bag.,"I beautiful piece of Anime that was crippled by being way to short. The worst part is Manga misrepresents this as a full length 83 minute film. The fact is its only 45 minutes long.The visuals are excellent and the two major battle sequences are action packed. The problem is there is no character development and no time is spent to really flesh out any kind of storyline. What could have been a masterpiece is reduced to a action fest that is over before it really starts.Its worth a rental, but I can't recommend it to any but the most hard core Anime fans. The film did not live up to the hype."
1,very negative,"As you read this book, you start thinking, ""Could Ethel Kennedy have been this bad?"" I doubt it. If a book totally changes your opinion of someone, telling you things you had never heard before; you can almost bet that a lot of it isn't true. I think the author started out with the intention of painting a very negative picture about Ethel and Bobby. This book is a snow-job if I've ever read one. When I read about someone, I don't want a book that has nothing good to say about the subject. If you aren't interested in a totally negative book about Ethel and the rest of the Kennedy's, then don't bother with this one."
4,Disappointment,"Jerry Oppenheimer did an outstanding job with much research and interviews for this book.I had always had a high regard for President Kennedy and his brother Robert Kennedy. I amdisappointed at some of the revelations revealed in this book. It is a different world ofpeople with unlimited financial resources, but abundance of money does not make a betterperson, I think it actually brings out negative attitudes of pride and arrogance. I nevermade it a point to know Ethel Kennedy, but I have had a high regard for Jackie Kennedy. Ithink being first lady with Jack was very hard for her. I anguish for both Jackie and Ethelat the tragic loss of their famous husbands, for them and their children. The Kennedy andSkakel families despite or maybe because of their wealth had to deal with very tragic events.I am not disappointed with the author, as I mentioned, he did an outstanding job. I amdisappointed in the outcome of all of their lives."
2,Couldn't hear my son during the night!,"This monitor worked fine for about 6 months. Then it started this out of range beeping everyone has been talking about. Annoying, but rarely did it during the night so i could deal with it. After 1 year of use, the speaker must have gone out. The receiver lights up but no sound comes out. I have no idea how long my poor son was crying before i heard him."
3,3 Stars is pretty good coming from me,"I like world pop (as opposed to world music), and buy a lot on a whim. I am big fan of Pizzacato Five, and of Os Mutantes, so this Japanese/Brazilian combo seemed like a natural for me. While not as inspiring as either of those bands, these kids make for fun listening. I had planned to give this disc to several friends for the holidays, but, alas, this is an import and not readily stocked by Jeff B. and company. Music for MLK day, anyone?"
3,Larissa Barington,"This book was packed with easy to understand spirituality. I never thought that ""we always set up a purpose and mission for each life before we are born"" and that ""this world is a training ground for souls."" I had always wondered if we reincarnate then why don't we remember our past lives and I liked Okawa's explanation that it's because if we remembered we would live under the pressure of duplicating the achievements of the past. Not bad!"
5,Hasn't warped yet!,"I needed a large cutting board to replace a simlarly sized one that was showing its wear after 20 years. This board fit the bill and is reasonably priced. I'm very happy after a month of use that this board has neither warped or cracked, which was the case of the two other boards I had tried from my local discount store.I would buy this board again in an instant."
5,Fabulous book!!!,"I love this book. Even though I lived in Berlin for 5 months, this book introduced me to new things to see when I went back to visit. A book to inform you before your trip, and for you to treasure afterward! The pictures are amazing."
5,"Don't got to Berlin, Germany without it!","I wish they made these for every city in the world. It has great walking travel guides, restaurant suggestions, historic information, and more. I bought one for Vienna, Austria and we loved them both!"
4,A Good Quick Reference Book,I would not want to pay full price for this book but at it's current reduced price I believe it is a good buy. It has a nice cross reference to substitute woods and traits of the wood when working with it in the shop. There are also a number of other traits listed that provide a good brief summary. I'm glad I bought the book.
2,What Bible,"A seventh grader doing a report on woods, with access to a few picture could do a better job!"
1,Talk about a horrible book!,"This book was just horrible. All the characters were irritating and annoying, I didn't like any of them (especially not Zenpfenning and Utricacea). The plot was so utterly annoying! It made me want to pull out my hair! I guess it was supposed to be funny and witty but it seriously was more annoying than humourous. Rebecca Lickiss turned a simple little conflict (of the princes needing a princess's kiss to break a spell) into a whole novel. It was stupid how Vevila (who was supposedly a head strong girl) could not do something so simple as push the witch aside and kiss the stupid princes. Overall, this book was really annoying to read and I was unfortunate enough to buy it."
4,"Great Item, Great price","Great Jewel Cases, very sturdy, fantastic cost. Looking forward to buying more of these."
1,WTF?!,I used to look forward to the Lyricist Lounge cd's... this one got my thinkin WTF?! this is complete crap. These were hot cd's but this one is garbage.. sure some people will like this.. but anyone who knows hiphop will know betta than to buy this. Its sad how good music is hard to come by now... Dont buy this.. pick up the original Lyricist Lounge CDs and check out soundbombing 1-3.. thats hot music.. this one isnt worth the cd its burned on..
5,great movie need more like it,I didn't get bored. The story line was great. I don't know how to review movies but this is definitely on my recommend list.
5,aMAZingly good fun for all,My son started playing this at 3 and still going strong at 5yrs old...he loves it and it's great for his thinking skills.....I love it too and realize how simple and or complex it can be depending on the level...this was our first and we now have 5 of these type of games but the ones from educational insights are our favorites and they are always coming out with more cool puzzle games. And I believe it due due to toys like this that my just turned 5 yrs old is doing 1-2 grade work and loves a challenge! Many praises for this product!
5,"Charming poetry & pictures, ideal for kids, fun for everyone","Richard Armour's simple, entertaining book (with memorable illusrations by Leonard Everett Fisher) is a great introduction to American political history -- fun for the newcomer and the expert alike. Even many years later, whenever the name of an obscure President is mentioned, one of Mr. Armour's quotes is likely to pop to mind (such as, regarding Franklin Pierce, ""the most that most remember, is that he was handsome,"" or of Eisenhower, ""let Ike but grin that boyish grin, and those at outs with him were in,"" and dozens more). I've always wanted to thank Armour and Fisher for such a delightful book, and it's great this review gives me a chance to do so. Thanks guys!"
2,don't leave it on,"I like the idea of this monitor! Bought it with first child. Less than two years later went to use the second camera for 2nd baby and didn't work. It was no longer under warranty, so all they would was send another camera. They sent 3, none worked. Then a month later the monitor went stopped working. We did leave it on most of the time, so maybe turn it off when not in use"
1,Boring! Not worth the cost.,"This is the first book I've read by Mr. Bailey, and most likely the last. The Fallen, might have been better off written as a short story. The beginning is okay, but after 20 or so pages the story becomes repetitive. From middle to end is a dud. I've read worse 'alleged' horror novels, but The Fallen is definately rated in the top 10 of BORING."
4,WHENCE COMES THIS RUSH OF WINGS,"I found THE FALLEN to be a much more enjoyable book than Bailey's subsequent HOUSE OF BONES. Bailey gives the story a foundation of atmospheric tension, a puzzling mystery, a connection between past and present events which he brings together in the final pages.Henry Sleep is a likeable character; his past haunts him still and his relationship with Emily is strong, though tentative. Ben Stranger is another good character, a newspaper writer given a reprieve; Harold/Grubb is a complex and unique type of psychopath, whose conflict with his two personalities forms an important part of the plot.Set in a rural West Virginia town, Bailey knows how to use blizzards and small town life effectively.There are no real surprises here, but it's an entertaining journey and displays the writing talent of Mr. Bailey."
3,"Disappointing,but worth a listen","The main reason for buying this CD is to hear Jerry Herman's lovely score.It's always worth listening to,but this version islike the movie itself-a major disappointment.There are a fewgood things on the disc-the title track,Robert Preston,BeatriceArthur,and Jane Connell.But the rest of the cast simply can'tsing,and Fred Werner's musical direction is mediocre at best.And the worst thing of all is Lucille Ball.Sure,she tries hard,butlet's face it-as ""I Love Lucy"" proved,she simply was not a musical comedy performer(and I'm a Lucy fan!)There is no doubtthat Angela Lansbury should have played Mame,but just as theydid with ""My Fair Lady"" and Julie Andrews,Warner Brothers didn'tconsider her a big enough name for the box office.Overall,this is an acceptable soundtrack,but if you want the best ""Mame""album,get the Broadway cast recording instead."
1,I HATE Lucy...as Mame!,"Lucille Ball was the amazing, gifted, hands down Queen of comedy during the golden age of television, but she was NO AUNTIE MAME! While the supporting actors are great in their performances, Ball hopelessly cackles out her lyrics with all the grace and talent of a bull frog with a severe case of laryngitis. It was truly one of the greatest crimes in modern cinema to have cast Lucille Ball over Angela Lansbury, and listening to this album only confirms the fact that the world was absolutely robbed by the film makers shameful decision to cast Ball in this cringe inducing performance. Do not waste your money on this version of Mame, stick with the Original Broadway Cast instead, it is still the one and only best."
4,Good Mix,"Goin' South, Vol. 2 is a good mix of Southern rock feel. I too had a hard time when I looked at all the bands but when you listen, you'll understand that Southern Rock is more of a style and genre within the rock genre than it is purely Southern bands or groups.I think the feel of all the music is what they are after and I love the music. If you want a good mix of that good old Southern Rock feel, go for it. If you want authentic Southern-only bands, don't do it! Regardless, not a bad mix at all..."
4,Useful to Beginners.,"Full of good ""how to's"". I had bought it for more advanced features, and was disappointed that it didn't get into more detail, but overall, I'm still satisfied with the book."
2,Too elementary,"I bought this book hoping for the usual quality and thoroughness of the ""Using"" series. I expected an encyclopedic book and didn't check the page count. This is a comparatively thin ""Using"" volume and covers the basics reasonably well with lots of screen shots. I was looking for advanced information on how to set up custom outlook forms and maybe some pointers on how to do it well. This is not covered. I am surprised you could stretch the basic stuff in Outlook to 200+ pages. I don't understand why anyone would write a guide on using Outlook except to cover advanced applications."
1,Saberhagen's Worst,"Plotting and character wise, Octagon was decent. The novel didn't actually end. A final page of text, right in the middle of the action is followed by the back cover. I actually tracked down a second copy of this novel to verify it had no end, and it wasn't a strange printing error with my copy.I hate novels without a resolution at the end, and Octagon was the first Science Fiction novel to bail on me. Don't let this happen to you.Read anything else from Saberhagen (his Books of Swords were good), but avoid this. I liked the story, but hated the novel because you never know what happens to everyone in the end. This novel has no sequel I was able to find."
1,so insanely stupid,"there's no description, so... it's about a computer and an RPG, and the guy who goes to stop the evil supercomputer. worst scifi book next to Dune (yes, i hate Dune. so kill me.)"
2,Doesn't keep good time,"I've learned my lesson. Don't buy hardware from clothing companies.The watch is large, heavy and attractive. However; if I need to see what time it ""really"" is I need to whip out my iPhone."
2,"Poorly written, hit-or-miss poker book","This guy is a professional writer? He seems to have created this book by thinking of a poker-related topic, writing a chapter about it, then doing another one. Whenever he runs out of something to say, he writes about...himself! Who cares? And who edited this book? Twice he uses the redundant phrase ""old adage"" and once the horrible ""very unique"". An exercise in the New Journalism that's not worth your time. Read ""The Biggest Game in Town"" by A. Alvarez or ""Big Deal"" by Anthony Holden for the real deal."
4,Awesome book about an awesome game,"Having just gotten into the game of the poker, I've been reading quite a bit about it from strategy books to books that focus more on the accounts of actual games, like Bellin's. It's a fast read about a great game and Bellin manages to get everything in there: his own stories, stories of others, strategies, and history. A great read."
4,a pleasure to read if you have the poker bug,this was my first read on the subject of poker. it gives a very good feel for the real life of people who take poker very seriously.a good sociological overview of the people who let a form of gambling become too serious in their lives.
2,Pales in Comparison,"I don't get the fuss about Poker Nation. Like many poker books this latest one by someone who apparently has never written anything before is Okay at best. I found the writing very crude in spots. To compare this half-baked collection of Bellin's recollections of ""characters he has known"" to true poker masterpieces like ""Big Deal"" and ""Telling Lies and Getting Paid"" is an insult. That's why poker's a great game I guess... Ithink people who have never read about poker might think this book is fascinating and edgy. Everyone else will probably wonder what people see in this. After reading this... narrative I know I personally appreciate the couple of well-written poker books that are still in print and in my library."
2,Not Much Meat,"Here's another example why books about gambling are mostly a deadly bore. This weak book either insults the intelligence of people who know something about poker or fails to present a single new idea to hold our interest. For my money there's been three books that capture what playing poker is really all about: ""Biggest Game in Town,"" ""Big Deal,"" and ""Telling Lies and Getting Paid."" Also, they're written beautifully. And I can't harldy say that about this one, which seems very amateurish at times. I'd ""fold"" this bore and ""raise"" with Alvarez, Holden, and Konik."
2,Dreams,Someone told me about this book and I was impressed by the story but very agitated about all the mis-spelled words and the obviouse poor editing. I hope the author has a relationship with the editor that will not allow her to be insulted like this for future publications.
2,Minerva and Sylvster stoled the show...,"2.5 stars. I enjoyed the first half of this book because Minerva and Sylvester from the last book was apart of the plot. Annabelle the heroine was too anti-heroine and did not have any likable characteristics. I actually like it when the heroine is not perfect and is realistic with a flawed personality but I also want her to have a few redeeming qualities so that the reader can still root for her, and it was extremely hard to do that with Annabelle."
3,G-d's appointed customes,"This book was not as rewarding as we hoped. It is old news, at best. Sorry, we'll probably pass it along to newbee's as we are beyond it."
4,Serves its purpose,"I found that it does exactly what it's meant to: build calluses on your fingertips. This wasn't exactly what I bought these for, but I may have been presumptuous with what their capabilities were. They're not great for any exercises besides the individual finger exercises. I was hoping they would be effective at building calluses on other parts of my hand, but it's not the best way to do that. So I guess if you want to build those fingertip calluses for playing guitar or for any other reason, it'll definitely do that. You'll see pretty quick progress if you do it consistently, too."
5,Great for the budding string player,"Builds up callouses quickly with only two to three 2 minute sessions per day. Easy to install and remove, and a perfect fit."
2,Hard To Use,"I tried to use this trowel for applying Venetian plaster to bullnose corners, but the trowel is too large for working on corners with limited side clearance. Also, the stiff, sharp-edged metal blade does not conform well to corner serfaces, and it's too large for scooping plaster from one-gallon cans. I found the more compact plastic trowel, also sold by Amazon, much easier to use."
3,Great Photos - great spirit - now learn to write!,"The photos and scope of this book are wonderful. I believe that Mr. Allen loves and knows Swing Dancing. Unfortunately, he does not know how to write a coherent English sentence! From the Introduction: ""The eyes of the individual learning to dance are very deceptive we have learned that you only see the result of force and not what or even where is the generation of that force energy."" Yikes! I think there is gold to be mined from this book, but be prepared to do some prospecting and dig deep."
4,.,"i enjoy this album..if you are an awol one fan or a shapeshifter fan, buy it..the album is pretty well produced, with some traditional dope beats, and a few beats not everyone would appreciate, but still are easy to listen to..the lyrics are down to earth, with feeling, and are done in his traditional, unique style..the guest appearances are good on this album as well."
4,Yellow Pearl - good stuff!,"I first heard Yellow Pearl in the airport in Amsterdam, and bought one of their CD's for 10 Euros. I listened to it once I got back to the US, and I think it is very good. The songs are very listenable and have a definite pop feel. I wish there were previews online so you could get a feel for it. If you like Dave Matthews, the feel is similar."
5,Looks a way nicer in person..!!,"I have several TAG's and this one is actually my second Aquaracer model. What really impressed me, was the partial stainless steel finish from inside out, crown to middle bracelet section, and easy readiness compared to newer F1's models.It might look Sporty, but as you dress up from Casual to suit up, it goes along perfectly, very few watches has this versatility, which makes it quite attractive to wear it at all times. I personally was looking for an intermediate model that provides me this adaptability, and I'm very happy I found it.Very affordable, nice piece of work, looks solid, even bracelet is sturdier than most TAG's. It arrived as promised and with original package and and proper protection (all 100% impeccable)."
1,This is a horrible movie.,"This is a scary, dark, movie. Children under 6 should not be allowed to watch this movie. The easter bunny brought this movie to my house for my 2 year old who loves trains. On easter morning he was so excited that i put the movie in to sit with him and watch. This is a really bad movie. It looks nice, there are some fun songs, however the story line is scary and evil. There are bullies who want to beat up a young boy, there is a nightmare train, there is kidnappings, and near death experiences. And the language the toys and trains use is even mean and angry. I ended up fast forwarding thru most of the movie. I feel bad for my son, cause now he knows this movie is in the house but will not be able to watch it. I really wish I could return this movie its really not for kids. Some advice, do not buy or watch this movie."
5,3 Year old LOVES it,"Seeing the reviews of people saying how scary this was during parts I felt the need to add my two scents. My 3 year old is sensitive but is also aware of what is real and what isn't. I've actively taught him what pretend and real is. Although he thought the Nightmare Train was scary, he was not in tears, nor has he had nightmares. He simply says scary, points at the screen and is cheering the little engine on. He has wanted to watch this every day since we first found it on Netflix. To the point that I am buying it. My suggestion would be to watch it yourself first, then decide. As a parent you know what your child can handle."
2,Okay album,"I think this album is o.k,but I think that Michael's songs are too sad and depressing. Not all of them. There are some songs like chickadee cherub that are very upbeat, But for the most part they too sad."
3,"Too simple, games don't have higher levels","I have fallen out of love with this toy. We got it for our very young kids and they still love it BUT, I think they've mastered the highest levels on all the games we have and there is no where for them to go with it. I really wish there was a level 3 and maybe 4 on the games.This is more a review of the software. The design of the central unit is great, and for kids just at the edge of being able to control a computer it is great. But one of my kids is six and there's no challenge to the games anymore. And with Leapfrog putting out new systems every week I think they are going to move on rather than make better, more challenging games.If you find one at the right price this is a good system (for a 3 year old I might say it is a 5-star product). But I think you will be disappointed in how it does not grow with the child."
5,Engaging Like a Video Game,"I bought the ClickStart because, like some of the other reviewers stated, my son (3 year old) likes to mess with my laptop. I figured this was a great alternative and I was right. It has been worth every penny. He has the best time playing the games that came with the system. He laughs and cheers himself when he does something good. I really like this because my son always wants to play with his cousin's Playstation. I don't want to introduce him to video games at such an early age. He needs time to develop and this system is great. My son actually thinks he's playing the video games that his cousin plays. I like how it talks to him and encourages him when he does something good. My daughter (1 year old) tries to play but she's a bit too young. This product is worth the hype. I just hope it lasts for several years."
4,"Great Toy, but encountered problem","My 3 year-old son loved this ""puter"" from the moment we hooked it up. He is learning and getting a lot out of it, but have encountered continuous problems with the keyboard not going into ""sleep mode"" since their is not an on/off switch. Within the first three weeks I have gone through 2 sets of keyboard batteries and 1 set of console batteries -- buy the adapter for the console! Today I called LeapFrog and initially they tried to tell me to remove the batteries after every use (yea right!)now they are going to replace the keyboard...hopefully that will do the trick. They should have designed it so you could turn it off....maybe the next generation!"
3,Sitting your kid in front of the TV to learn doesn't seem right to me.,"We got this as a present but we have not even opened it. It seems to me that sitting our young son in front of the TV to play games, even if they're ""educational"" doesn't seem right to me. I know it's easier parenting for us to have him staring catatonically in front of the TV for an hour, but I don't want to teach him at age 3 to become obsessed with the computer games and TV. Just my opinion."
2,Poor quality graphics,"The components work as specified. No problems with mouse. Unfortunately the quality of graphics is so poor that its painful to look at. I keep thinking something must be configured wrong, but based on other reviews it seems this is typical. Desktop machines from 10 years ago could do better. In retrospect I would have spent $100 on an old computer and had the option/access to much more robust learning software for my toddler."
3,Great for kids if it is working properly,"I got this for my 3 year old's birthday. He loved it instantly! He played it nonstop the first couple of days, then it began to have issues with the mouse. The problem was usually at Scout's house, which was actually my son's favorite part of the game. When the mouse froze, we just had to turn the game off and reboot to get it to work again. I made sure the mouse was in tightly and also that the infrared was lined up properly, but that didn't resolve the problem permanently.We wanted to get more games, but wanted the issue corrected before we bought more. I contacted the company via email twice and they didn't respond so we chose to return the product."
3,"Great concept, poor execution","The educational value of this toy is great for a toddler. However, the engineering execution is very poor. It only connects with one composite video cable. The picture on the larger LCDs is horrendous.Moreover, unless you have receiver pointing directly at the keyboard, the mouse will loose connectivity, as the low-frequency sensors loose conectivity if the keyboard is below or above the main unit, making it almost impossible to use if the unit sits on the shelf below/above where your child is sitting...I mean in the age of the HDTV, how can Leapfrog provde a single composite connection to HDTV, where a child needs to struggle to make out the picture!?!?!? As an engineer, i have to say SHAME for releasing low-aplified product with sub-par video. Otherwise, the company makes the best, educational products, bar none..."
3,More Educational than other Video games,"This was a X-mas present for our 3 year son. He was very excited for the fist 3 months but now he plays just every now and then.The ClickStart is a great toy to get them started on the computer world with educational games and control. I find it useful and recreational, the image quality is not great when you use a big screen HDTV as I do, but I don't think kids see the difference. Great material, resistant to boys treatment... nice colors.On the downside, the mouse does not go on ""stand by"" mode or something similar, therefore the battery life is not as long as I expected. And clearly, to keep your kids interested on the game, you have to keep buyng the games... one game will not be interesting after a couple of months."
1,Very disappointed,"My daughter received this as a Christmas gift and it literally lasted 5 minutes before it refused to work any more. She is not rough with her toys, generally speaking, and was playing with the keyboard whn suddenly she complained that nothing was happening. Sure enough, the mouse was stuck in the bottom corner of the screen and would not respond to commands at all. Started the machine again and nothing. Took the batteries out and replaced...nothing. So, this toy lasted less than a few minutes before becoming useless. I am very disappointed in the quality of Leapfrog toys lately. The last 3 or 4 have not worked for more than a week or two."
1,A Big Disappointment,"I love Leapfrog toys and have several for my daughter, but this was a huge disappointment for us. She would love to play it but the mouse is impossible for her to use and just doesn't work well at all. What should have been a great learning toy is nothing but frustration for us all."
1,Mouse stopped working,"Like others have discovered, my mouse periodically will stop working all together. If I turn it off for about an hour, yes an hour, it will start to work again. This happens regularly, very frustrating when your 2 yr old kid is getting upset he cannot play."
3,Not what I expected!,"I was really looking forward to the arrival of this toy after reading all the positive reviews but, sorry to say, it doesn't meet my expectations. The key board and mouse pad seem to have a mind of their own. I understand the mouse is made for little hands but even my 3 yr old has a hard time pointing and clicking. It could be that this particular keyboard and mouse are defective since it appears like not too many people have experienced this. [...]. The learning material is so-so, it didn't meet my expectations but my 3 yr old seems to enjoy it (too bad the mouse won't cooperate)."
4,Good little toy,"We have had other LEapster toys which we are happy with, so had no hesitations when buying the LeapFrog 'My First Computer'. I have three children aged 4, 5 and 7 who love it. It is especially good for the 4 and 5 year old, but maybe too young for my 7 year old daughter.The pros are that it is durable (rather than letting the kids play games on our home computer), it shows up on the TV Screen (so others can easily watch, rather than crowding around the home computer) and the games are educational.The downside is that the games have limited things to do, and can be very easy, which then become 'boring'. My kids seem to love it though, so perhaps that is just me, the adult, expecting more entertainment/options from the games.I still think it is a worthwhile product, and my kids love it."
2,"All fluff, no stuff.","What a disappointment this toy is. Although it was easily set up the so called wireless keyboard and mouse require ""line of sight"" with the controller. Do they really expect small, wiggly children to sit still with the keyboard on their laps, keeping it pointed in one direction? Additionally, the mouse has a short, stiff lead wire and the mouse pad is far too small for the mouse.The user must constantly pick up the mouse and relocate it onto the pad.Worst of all, is how boring the ""games"" are. Our 5-year old mastered each game within minutes and is no longer interested in them at all. Yet another device that will never get used again.We expected more from LeapFrog."
3,TOO MUCH INFO DALTON,"I feel that reviews from others that have read a book before are great, but it is not hopeful when they tell to much info. Dalton i thank you for your review but you gave too much info telling that Aria had menopause, thats something you should let the readers find out."
2,Lamp is expensive and doesn't last,"This TV has good picture quality, but the lamp only lasts about a year (if you're lucky) and it costs about $150. My third lamp burned out in 3 years."
2,in dire need of some decent editing,"Although writing the perfect trekking guide is an almost impossible excerise, there is certainly room for improvement in Bradt's latest offering. Whilst generic lonely planet guide blueprint is limited, the layout employed here is quite confusing and random, with maps, route descriptions, silly anecdotes, natural history, local culture and general travel advice thrown in together in a very messy fashion which limits the usefulness of the book as a reference material. The content itself is extremely bloated with superfluous info and suffers from inconsistent writing - at times it feels more like a disparate collection of internet postings than a trekking guide. Whilst is great to see the alternate and no less spectacular routes getting a mention, some serious thought needs to be given to the editing process - it is a difficult task to write a concise and informative guide, but this is what is necessary to stand out from the dross."
2,I've heard a better sounding Red Book version,"I was really excited about CCR in SACD. Knew it was stereo, but was still expecting clear imaging. Previous reviews had bombed both Green River and Bayou Country. Like you, I try to determine who knows what they're talking about. Bad news is the worst critics were right. I've listened to better sound from the Red Book Box set. I'm still planning to get Cosmo's as others say that has a better sound...I hope so!!! Come on!!!Trust me, I own over 75 SACDs/DVDAs. Is it Steve Hoffman or soemthing happening afterwards? It's not my system."
1,Poorly made machine,"Drive shaft for the belt feed snapped off after only four uses. Very poor quality steel. However, grizzly was very good about taking it back and offering free shipping to return it."
5,Best CD EVER,"Luke Vibert (a.k.a Wagon Christ) put this record out in 1994, yet its still lightyears ahead of most trip-hop/idm albums today. DJ Shadow, Amon Tobin, and Prefuse 73 definitely borrowed a lot from this break-through recording. Not even Vibert himself has topped Throbbing Pouch. If you like (good) music, get this album. It's some of the best music I've ever heard."
2,Same old...,"I bought this book as an infant caregiver and was disappointed to see that it was all the things I'm already doing with my babies...there were a few different ideas, but overall, not worth it."
2,Very basic,"The book is not quite what I expected. It is very basic - it describes different kinds of games to play, with very little insight or reasoning why this or that particular game helps development. It's basically just a book of game rules, nothing more."
1,Complete Waste of Money,"I bought this book thinking that it would provide me with great ideas for activities to play with my baby and after reading it, I quickly returned it. I would have rated it zero stars but that was not an option. The book is filled with unimaginative ""games"" to play with babies (e.g., sing a lullaby to your infant at bedtime). If you have a little bit of creativity or imagination you can come up with better activities than the ones mentioned in this book. Don't waste your money."
1,not worth the money,"I purchased this blower to do only my small sidewalk and in front of my garage doors for I have someone who plows my driveway...The price was right and what I had read lead me to believe this was just what I needed. When the blower arrived it took only a couple of minutes to put together - we had just had a snow storm and the timing was perfect for me to use my new blower.. I started to blow the snow which was only 3-4 inches deep and about 15 minutes into it something snapped on the inside of the blower and that was the end. I finished the rest by hand, packed this unit back into the box and returned it. I was totally dissapointed in the workmanship and would not recommend this product to anyone. However Amazon was great in handling my problem & I will continue to use thierservice which has always been #1 in my opinion. Hope you found this very helpful.."
3,Snow Fox adequate,"Given the limitations of a single stage snowblower coupled with an electric motor I feel that the Snow Fox performs as well as can be expected.On the plus side, it is simple to set up, fairly light to handle, has some directional control,and is always ready as long as there is electrical power available. It is also largely plastic so that it is gentle on my deck surface.On the down side, it is small, which means that a heavy snowfall or a large area to clear will take an extended work session. I have not had occasion to test it on wet snow yet and I am not confident that it will have the power to cope with that problem.All in all I am satisfied that it will perform as expected and will fill my need for a device to clear my home's deck."
3,not for deep or heavy wet snow,"We just tried out the Snow Fox snow thrower, and while it might be good for normal fluffy snow under 4"", 7"" of super-heavy snow requires 3-4 passes, having to hold the unit up and 'shave' 2"" per pass. In the end, it was faster than shoveling, but only a little.Since it uses different muscles, once you get tired from shoveling, use the snow-thrower for a while to rest the other muscles.The snow we tried it on was 7"" - 8"" of wet heavy snow. Where normal snow is 10"" of snow to 1"" rain equivalent, this studd was reported to be 3"" of snow to 1"" rain. Nasty stuff.It DID move the snow, but simply couldn't handle the heavy wet stuff if more than 2-3"" at a time. I was slightly worried about burning it up, so I rested it after every 5' x2 passes wide."
1,"Chip On His Shoulder, Time On His Hands...","This guy knows his baseball coaches. He's apparently seen every bad one in the book. And if you're a player stuck with one of these lousy coaches (they're all lousy, by the way, none of them are interested in helping kids, they are all in it for themselves), his advice is glib, snide, and misguided.Imagine a guy who thinks he's Dennis Miller, stretching every joke to the last possible descriptive metaphor. Imagine a guy who seems obsessed with the idea that all coaches only volunteer for Little League so they can turn their own sons into the MVP of the team. Imagine a guy who thinks kids need to be armed with cynicism, not idealism, as they enter Little League.Imagine a guy who finds ""Field of Dreams"" to be a waste of celluloid.That's who you're dealing with here and it translates into a really boorish, frustrating book that serves no real purpose except letting a frustrated coach/writer vent his spleen. Maybe he needs a blog. Or a hobby."
3,spare tire cover,I am disappointed that I thought I was ordering the size I needed by the tire size but the cover does not fit tight. It may be my error but I thought I ordered by the instructions.
2,THE BROTHER'S NEED A BIT MORE WORK!,"I HATE TO DISS, BUT..... I WAS SO HYPED ABOUT A NEW CHEMICAL BROTHERS ALBUM AND THIS IS WHAT I GET. I UNDERSTAND IT'S A D.J. ALBUM BUT THESE GUY'S HAVE BEEN SPINNING FOR YEARS AND THE ALBUM SOUND'S LIKE SOME PUNK D.J WITH $5 BOUGHT SOME OLD SCHOOL WAX AND TAPED IT AT HIS HOUSE. DON'T GET WRONG THE ALBUM HAS IT MOMENT'S, (MOSTLY AFTER THE FIRST HALF). IF THIS IS WHAT'S THE FUTURE IS FOR CHEMICAL THEY MIGHT WANT TO CALL THEIR NEXT ALBUM ""BROTHERS GONNA WORK FOR FOOD"""
2,gets old fast,"Brother's Gonna Work It Out is a fun album to listen to for a while but after a certain point, the music becomes really repetive and non-inspired. This is not the chemical brother's best album. Save your self this album and get dig your own hole."
4,This is good stuff,"It does take some getting used to, but I think that they have genuinely succeeded in producing an album that allows them to deviate into some other areas of classic funk/pop while still retaining that Chemical sound. I was disappointed at first, but actually after awhile it is an album of genius."
2,Bits and pieces,"Not knowing very much about the CB except from some popular songs, I bought this CD after listening to some of it and liking the beat. When I had played it a couple of times though, I found out that it isn't half as great as I had expected...knowing some other DJ mixes, I have to say that a big part of this one is quite dull and badly put together and even if I listen to it a lot I only listen to about 15 minutes of the middle and that's it. I recommend putting your money on something else. 15 minutes of good music is not worth this price."
2,not as good as expected.,"This is my first cb cd, the only other thing i've heard is ""Block rocking beats"" and that's the the sound i expected. The mixing is ok and there is a few good beats but that's it. Overall it's somewhat boring."
3,Pretty but broken,The earrings have a lovely lustere and are 7.5 mm. The post pulled out of the pearl when I tried to pull the back off. I should have sent them back but I epoxy-ed the post on instead.
1,Here I Am is your best bet,"If you remove the repeated songs on this disc pinched from ""Here I Am"" you are left with some really flat and uninteresting songwriting. Highly predictable, lyrically trite and frankly, a bit dated in a metal-chick mode.The definite promise Raven showed in ""Here I Am"" is completely absent, and I fear another talent is lost to whatever happens when commerce triumphs over muse."
5,Great buy picture is False,"The Product is not what is shone in the picture. but , the product they send is none worse its sliver bbs coated with aluminuim i belive. Great bbs ship 2400 instead of 3000 i belive but it is plentygreat buy"
5,A classic graphic novel,"This is NO substitute for reading the novel, but if you already love the story of Lestat, this is a beautiful version of it worth having. Some it might not be as you imagined it, but most of it is dead on. Much of the dialogue is kept intact but the interesting choices of angles, styles, layout and mood keep it from geting tiresome and static. I wish there was a leatherbound deluxe edition!"
2,Poor reception,Even though the speakers are in the same room as the receiver the sound fades in and out and crackles
2,there is nothing wireless about this system,i opened the box and there were more wires and cables than i knew what to do with! the directions were very very poor and i had a difficult time knowing how to set it up. i did finally figure it out. the transmitter has to be plugged in (fine). the speakers have to be plugged in (okay...) and to get both speakers to play they have to be connected by speaker wire (not okay). didn't meet my needs to be able to move one to one room and one to another room. the sound was great but not a wireless product by my definition. returned them.
1,Product didn't work for me,"I got the package. Figured out how to set it up with a completely useless User's Manual. Spent hours trying to sync the transmitter with the receiver with no luck at all. Just went crazy watching green, red and orange lights on the speaker. Could not find a support number. I got the green lights occasionally but wasn't able to sync. I tried the JBL support line, waited for 30 mins and still didn't get any live support. Any help on how to sync would be appreciated. ThanksJBL Control 2.4G On Air Wireless Speaker System (Pair)"
5,Great Sound!,I own several retail stores and we were looking for a high quality speakers so we could run Pandora. I loved them so much I bought them for all of the stores (3) . They have a very high quality sound and do not sound cheap. Definitely the best band for your buck!
4,WORTH THE MONEY,"MOST OF MY TIME IS IN A WHEELCHAIR, SO I DON'T REALLY WEAR SHOES OUT. THESE SHOES FEEL GREAT--LOOK GREAT AND WILL BE WITH ME A LONG TIME. HEY, I LOVE HUSH PUPPIES ANYWAY!"
5,Calm and Refreshing,"WOW - What a calm and refreshing way to start the day.Stretching in a quiet place at home with Mirabai Hollands tape was the most personal and least intimidating experience I've had with a workout in quite a while!Is there more to come from her, I hope?"
2,Was hopeful,"My Cholesterol was 220 with out meds or supplements. I tried Cholest-Off by Nature Made and it went down to 206 and kind of hovered there for a couple years. The Cholest-Off was a little pricy, had to take multiple (large) pills with meals and they made me constipated. Thought I'd give the Sytrinol a try, smaller pills and just 1 twice a day and not too high in price. So I had blood work done in early January and cholesterol was 206, stopped the Cholest-Off and started the Sytrinol. Did not notice any side effects to speak of. Had blood redrawn in late July and cholesterol was 215. Decided that I'm done wasting money on pills and that it is time to do it the old fashioned way and get serious with losing the extra 20 pounds that I've been carrying around!"
4,Faith No More for the 21st Centure,"Lostprophets is a synthesis of the music of a dozen or so (nu)metal bands of the past five years, but the music is very, very well done and soulful. I can hear traces of Incubus, POD, Hoobastank, and Linkin Park. But, what really caught my ear, ""To Hell We Ride"" could be a Faith More song off ""Epic""... And true, just like FNM was the perfect synthesis of metal in its time, Lostprophets seems to be a similar melting pot for its time."
5,"Jesus, Priceless Treasure","Always be prepared to give a reason for what you believe. Pastor Preus does this in language and hymns that always and only point the repentant sinner to Jesus. A fine complement and review of our Lutheran catechism. I particularly liked the chapter, A Matter of Mountains, which describes the life of confession through Mt. Sinai, Calvary and Zion. Thank you, Pastor for offering this beautiful and unique presentation of the Christian faith."
5,Four Freshmen In Person,This two LP based CD is very high quality and saves me the time to record from my old LPs and still have great sound.
5,Great Vintage Freshmen,"The ""live"" portion resonates with the best the Four Freshmen ever offered. The live show brings out the best in them - I love it!"
2,Not Enough Action or Suspense,"I found the book boring, so about a quarter of the way through the book, I was tempted to stop reading. I thought, however, that the author was a newbie when it came to writing so I decided to give her another chance. The pace did pick up a little about half way through the book when another murder took place. However, I found the characters tiresome, with little to distinguish one from the other. Also, the author or agent should have proofread the book one last time for mistakes."
2,Wireless interrupts home network.,"The video quality is adequate for what it's for. I don't plan to make movies with it. I like being able to see the front and back of my house. However, the user manual is worthless. The biggest drawback is that the wireless cameras totally knock out my wireless home network. Laptops put next to the access point can't find a signal. It uses the same 2.4 GHz band as home routers. Swann said there is no solution, buy a wired system. Defeats the convenience feature, doesn't it? It could possibly interrupt your neighbor's as well. This must go for any other wireless system.I gave this product a low score because of the wireless network problem."
5,Excellent product,"Chose this paper because it was a great deal on a heavier weight paper, my printer (Canon MP620) requires special paper and does very poorly w/the cheap stuff. This paper comes out looking fantastic and is even good enough to print both sides w/most material. I still use photo paper for high end stuff but for book reports, work presentations, letters, internet reciepts etc. this is great stuff. I would recommend this product as a great paper for printers needing better grade paper to print well."
3,Kindle Edition is hard to navigate,"The commentary is great. The word of God is both timely and timeless. The author discusses how the passage is applicable to Paul's audience at that time then bridges the essence of the of his writing to contemporary times.I dislike the ebook version though. As the previous review said, there is no way to jump to the commentary for Romans 11 for example. I think this is the major flaw for reading on the kindle as kindle is designed to be read from beginning to the end. But for a bible study where you need to flip through different sections of the book... it is very difficult. I have an ipad though so i can just do a search for the chapter I want to study but even that is cumbersome. I suggest a linked Table of Contents would make this 10x better on the Kindle."
3,not the Moo Romans to get,"This is the wrong ""Romans"" by Moo to get. Get his other work on Romans.As D. A. Carson (who worked with Moo on 1992's ""An Introduction to the New Testament"") wrote: ""Only the most poorly trained pastor will prefer Moo's NIV Application commentary on Romans... to his NIC volume"" (p.72, ""New Testament Commentary Survey"")."
3,does not give base dimensions,"need to know if it will fit 3"" base or larger and this is not listed in dimensions so will not be buying. suggest listing base dimensions."
4,School never cost so much,"This volume was great!! I loved it!!Finishing off where volume 22 ended it captures your attention once again by introducing Hinako who uses the 5 yen and up attack, taught to her when she was young. Sucking 'delinquints' aura so they can't be bad is her ultimate tequnique thus making her into an attractive woman useing their energy.It was well, drawn, well written and the ending introduced yet another adventure, Shinosuuke!I recommend it to any Rumiko Takahashi fan!"
4,Wavy Wave,"I just received the piece and it is lovely. The only problem is that if it is not worn a certain way, the bracelet will roll. The edges of the pieces are sharp and if you press them against your wrist by holding a book or package, they hurt. I do really like it though..."
1,Save Your Money,"I wanted this product for a long time. It was one of my wish list items for months. When I finally decided to splurge and purchase this item (my wish list is loaded) I thought what an impressive accent piece this would be to my table setting. I waited with great anticipation for my chopsticks with their own holders to arrive. Then they arrived. I was so disappointed. The quality of the holders is awful. One of the holders was splintered at one end and the edges of both holders were unfinished. I decided to keep this item for personal use; however, they will never be used as part of a table setting. This is a great idea, that has been poorly implemented. If Joyce Chen is an actual person, I would advice her to do some quality control on the items that bear her name."
3,Nice.,"They are very nice looking, but not completely straight so they are a little challenging to eat with. It makes it hard to pick up food."
4,bamboo chopstix,these are pretty and elegant. Have to remind the kids to not let them soak in the sink. The holders are useless and should be tossed out or they just clutter up the drawer.We have no problem with them in particular. We aren't very good at chopsticks in general and want to practice. The cheezy ones that come from take out are rough wood and give me the chills. These are nice and smooth.
5,Great Decrative Item!,"I bought these almost 20 years ago at a local Chinese furniture market. I use them as decoration to hang above my stove. I get so many complements and people amazed how nice these look even for a non traditional use.The are very well made, but are not exactly the same. It appears these are either had made or different presses/molds are used to make them because they are all slightly different sized (the holder that is) the chopsticks are all the same size.I put them in rows of 3 on each side and one across the top. I have attached a picture above for you to see. I have another set that I just for eating purposes and they work just great. The are not too thin nor to bulky and hold food well. The decorative holder is nice especially when you dress up your table, but are rather useless once you take them out to use they kind of get in the way.I highly recommend the Joyce Chen Chopsticks with holders, you won't regret your purchase.Cheers and Vidimo Se!"
5,Great Lens,"I had this for a couple of weeks now. The lens seems very well built (Made in Japan). I use it with Canon T2i. The quality of the images is superb. I actually got rid of my Tamron 10-24 which I liked a lot because the quality and the crisp images this lens produces are just so much better and sharper.The best part is when this Tokina is zoomed in at 17mm, it almost doesn't look like a fisheye so as my girlfriend calls it a ""2 in 1"" lens."
2,Look elsewhere for greeting card paper,"This paper is okay but for two things.On the plus side, it is a nice bright (but not too bright) warm white that takes ink well with no significant bleed-through.But there are two things that kill this paper for practical use. There is a Kodak trademark printed in the lower-left hand corner of one side of the sheet. The intention is good: they want you to have the score line facing the proper way to get a really sharp fold. The problem is that you absolutely must do one or more test prints (hopefully on less expensive paper) to make sure you have the right side up for your printer. This is a needless pain.Second, the paper used for the envelope is so thin that the design of your card is clearly visible, which removes the surprise element.I would suggest exploring other brands for your greeting card needs.Jerry"
2,Meant for a moment,Severely dated and faded cornball psych-rock with occasional compositional fortitude penetrating gratingly showy vocals.
5,Encouragement,"This is my daily inspiration; Easy to read and understand. Great explanation. Everyday I read it, the more I feel closer to God."
4,Good Book for Daily Reading,This is a good book especially for those who want to learn the sequence of events in the Bible rather than just reading each book by itself.
5,Excellent resource,"I purchased this after borrowing someone else's off and on for many years--the two of us enjoy it so much! The chronological presentation makes it a pleasure to read straight through, and it's marked for daily reading that will get you through it all in one year. The commentary puts passages into perspective that may otherwise be confusing. The merging of the texts in the Samuel/Kings/Chronicles and prophets and Psalms deepens my understanding without a lot of cross-referencing and flipping around. I appreciate the synoptic parallels of the gospels and the placing of the epistles into the chronology of Acts.There are all caps headers before each passage that are sometimes distracting, and sometimes the efforts at chronology have left out some bits that don't seem to fit anywhere. However, I use this as a chronological reference only and not as my primary study text, so I do not feel in danger of missing something in this regard.I was very glad to find a clean used copy."
5,Daily Bible:New International Version,I LOVE this Bible. It has helped me understand God's word and helped me understand more about when and how things happened since it is in chronological order. I wish it came on CD though as I don't always have time to read it and get behind!
1,Worst movie I have ever seen,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen.....and to think I even saw it in the theater!! I read the Isaac Asimov short story, which is a classic, and believe me, this movie was nothing like it. I can't even give it one star, it was so bad.It made no sense, had no plot, and the acting was horrible. I was so disappointed, because I am a HUGE Asimov fan, and was expecting so much more."
2,This is no Foreskin,"If you're looking for another Foreskin's Lament, this isn't it. Very disappointing, too snarky, no poignant humor as in his previous works. Skip it."
2,Great album but mostly redundant with Chronicle,"There's not a bad song here, but seven of them are also on Chronicle: The 20 Greatest Hits. That leaves four, which other reviewers have described. If you're a big fan, you're going to have all seven studio albums, certainly including this one. For me, since I have Chronicle, I'm going to simplify my life and not keep Cosmo's Factory. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)"
5,Fun and Challenging,"I just got this game in the mail today and i love it. I haven't played all of the options you can play yet. So far i've only been the jockey. Like some other reviews said, it is difficult at first to win races, but if you keep at it and learn to pace your horse you can win with no problem. At first, i kept coming in last or almost last and was getting frustrated but it was a challenge to try to win and now i can do it fairly easy. I'm having lots of fun with it. It's a fun game....I recommend it."
4,Want to Understand Theological Roots?,"Written in the form of a college text, ""Pagan and Christian Creeds"" gives the reader a darn-good understanding of how many religious symbols and practices came to be in both pagan and more recent Christian rituals. Having more of an analytic mind, this gave me a solid foundation for choosing the spiritual routines best suited for me."
1,Terrible,"If I save even one person from wasting their time and money on this, it's worth it. I fell for all the positive reviews here, but now I'm thinking they must have been written by friends/relatives of the author. This is terribly written and tiresomely plotted -- boring, predictable and a complete waste of time."
5,best anime ever,this is definately one of the most beautiful and interesting animes to date. darker than hiyaos but unique and beautiful to look at. a must see for REAL fans.
5,Fun with the classics,I had many years ago Peter and the Commissar of vinyl but it got lost along lifes way and talking classical music with friends made me remember this recording. They do say not to visit a place you have been too years before as you will be dissappointed as things are never the same as you remember. Well I thought lets give it a go with the recording and to say I am happy I did make the purchase is an understatement.I must admit I do like classical music but for anyone who is not into classical music don;t worry as you will enjoy this. Beethovens 5th Cha Cha Cha brings new meaning to classical music which all music lovers will enjoy. I have played this now a dozen times on my car stereo and at home and laugh more with every listening so trust me folks GO BUY ITMartin Roland
4,Gong Li is at her best!,"I love this movie! Gong Li is such a great actress, she reminds me of the movie stars from the 30's and 40's."
2,101 American English Idioms: Understanding ...,This book it really helps a lot people like me that have English as a second language.It is now easier for me to communicate with american people.
5,Great Addition,An example is worth many thousands of words. This book is full of examples that exercise the use of Samba. A must addition to any Samba administrator's library.
2,Disappointing,"I've been pleased with other ""cookable"" bird foods, and gave this one a shot in the spirit of variety. I -- and my bird -- were disappointed with the result, a gooey red paste that quickly became hard and unappetizing. Instead of Kitchen Creations, I recommend Beak Appetit, which has more appealing variety and texture, and which does not make my parrot angry with me."
5,Excellent product,"I have used Seiko labels for years, and find them greatly superior to cheaper replacements. I doubt that I will ever have a reason to change my opinion."
1,OMG-It's RoadKill!,"OK the title says it all, the boots are a monstrosity, they are horrifically ugly and if you want to be a savage caveman with no fashion flare, then these are your best bet! I actually bought these as a gift for my sister and she puked when they were opened, these are awful, stay far away. Sorry for the graphic details, but these boots are unnecessary cruelty to the human eyes."
4,"Crazy, sexy cool.....",I am am avid IR romance reader (I am in a wonderful committed relationship with a very cute white jewish man) and this story is a good read...the characters were believable (yes I know she was a late bloomer...but it didn't take long for him to light her fires!) I like how they tumbled into love....and stayed.=0)
2,"It started to be an interesting read, but it fell apart","When I started to read this book, I thought that I was going to enjoy it. It was such an awful book that wasn't worthy of finishing. Yvonne and Michael were irritating to me with their constant whining. My favorite character was Michael's dog. If I wanted a better written interracial love story with greater character development, I can rely on Sandra Kitt as better a read. What a...waste of paper."
4,Finally died after 6 years of daily heavy use.,"I used this amp since I bought them on black friday in 2005 and it's performed well. I used the bridged mode with 2 12"" dual speakers in a bandpass box and even my friend with an all Alpine setup said it was worth the money. Just yesterday it started blowing fuses whenever it was supplied remote power and it turns out I got the bottom of the unit wet and the circuit board inside was very corroded. The only reason I give it a 4/5 and not a 5/5 is because the metal cover on top would cut into wires if given the chance, it is excessively sharp. Bad design there. If you can find this amp for cheap and are only worried about a mono setup i would buy it."
5,Independent and Brilliant,This indie filmmaker created a gem. It has talent in key places. It looks good and sounds good...bottomline. Story about someone coming home isn't unusual but we don't see that every day with the black panther aspect.Seller got this our quickly.Tieuel Legacy! Motion
3,Promising start for a new director,"Newcomer director Tanya Hamilton also wrote the screenplay and I'm pretty sure she has the movie she wanted. A long departed Black Panther returns to his old turf. Everyone believes he ratted out a comrade who was ultimately killed by the police. The feeling of the movie is right. The setting in 1976 Philadelphia looks right. The characters seem real. So what's my beef? In spite of some nice performances by the 2 leads, others seem amateurish and distant. Maybe it's accurate, I don't know. The film labors too long about the big secret. And when we think we've got it figured out, it changes directions. OK, fine. But where is the moral to the story? What is the point? Ultimately, the movie just ends and we're unfulfilled. Could have been better."
3,Allied 39025 178-Piece Tool Set,Look cheap but what can you expect with 178-Piece Tool Set that cost less than $100. Still a good buy for the price.
2,Cute(not),This is the set you would give your youngster to help daddy or mommy. It has a lot of the basic tools that can help a budding contractor to learn the value and the respect that tools deserve. Maybe as a backup if the high end tool fizzles. Good price and like I say this is great for a kid (supervised)to learn the use of power and hand tools
5,F***ing Brilliant,"Just lovely. Every page.Some excellent writing about this one, people, except -- all you fools out there who think this is pointless, has no relationship to Cerebus' story, etc etc etc... Come on. Y'all need to think a little harder on this one. I doubt Dave Sim would've spent so much time working on the book if there were no POINT to it, and didn't matter in Cerebus' larger structure. What, this was just a whim that Dave spent MONTHS working on?? Sure.Seriously, haven't you noticed some of the grander themes in the series, the things that tie it all together? both this volume, and the life and writing of Oscar Wilde, are exemplary of the self-definition, self-expression and alienation which Cerebus struggles with... Why are we who we are? Why do we love who we love? Why do we do what we do? It's a bigger-picture-sort-of-thing this time."
4,ummmm....not the high point,Dave Sim's admiration of Oscar Wilde makes for boring reading. This could have benifited by NOT having that part of the story in. The parts WITH our main character 'Cerebus' are of course great. The building of Cerebus coming back to the world is amazing....I found myself on the edge of my seat as he came to.
3,Entertaining Steampunk Comic Book,"This beautifully drawn, science-fantasy ""graphic novel"" is about the mysterious Rork, a kind of hip paranormal investigator with psychic powers in a vaguely Edwardian world.In a series of apparently unrelated episodes, Rork discovers the secret of a mad scientist's home, addresses a friend's dangerous scientific curiousity, fights a mysterious alien threat, and rescues a mysterious woman.Andreas' art is strongly influenced by the work of Bernie Wrightson, but his sensibility is that of Charles deLint - a nice combination."
1,Worst keyboard i've owned,"And I have owned my fair share trying to find the ""perfect"" feel.Don't get me wrong -- this keyboard is very nice looking. But after getting it home and working, i'm ready to throw it against the wall.So many dropped signals have me constantly going back and retyping. Sometimes i find myself pounding a key trying to get it to read. The feel is like lifting weights with your fingers. Just typing this review makes my hands hurt.Skip this things and get something better -- then tell me what it is cuz i haven't found it."
2,Wireless perfection but poor keyboard design,"Tired of unreliable Microsoft keyboards I tried this one hoping it's range would help insure key strokes entered actually made it to my screen. I must say I was delighted by this and it truly works from a good 8 feet away (10 is pushing it). The problem I have is the keyboard wasn't made for people that actually know how to type. The cushion pad sits so high, I can't use my thumb to strike the space bar! The same goes for trying to use the arrow keys or lower number keys. Too bad because it's technically superior to others in wireless operation - it's just not functional for usage."
2,not woth buying,"Since I installed the software for the mouse and keyboard, my computer won't shutdown properly. It won't let me uninstall and the media buttons don't work at all. The mouse is very ergonomically comfortable, but the pointer skips around. This kensington pilotboard sucks. I will never buy kensington again."
2,Unreliable,"I got little confused after reading contradicting reviews on this combo, so I double checked my model number. Yes, I do have Pilotboard 64390, and I completely agree with the rest of not so positive reviewers. It has a decent range, but that's all. It doesn't even come close to substituting a wired keyboard and a mouse, so forget about any serious usage."
2,Gets confused quickly,"The mouse and keyboard have worked perfectly for about a month. All of a sudden the mouse has started jumping around and it is difficult to control. I have tried changing the batteries, tried several different surfaces, and spraying the laser with compressed air to clean out any dust. Nothing seems to fix the jumpiness. I am not sure if this is a problem with all laser mice, but this is unacceptable. The keyboard works great however."
1,Save your money,"This was the worst thing I had ever spent money on. I had this rotisserie for about 9 months. After about 3 uses, the heating tray that sits on top began to peel and rust making it unusable. Next, the side grip on the top of the glass door fell off. I learned to live with this. Finally, one of the plastic legs on the bottom of the unit split and broke off into 3 pieces while I was putting it on the counter to use. This was in addition to it being very hard to clean and getting quite hot to the touch when used. I finally gave up and gave this thing a proper burial in the dumpster! I even contacted customer service & told them whathappened (by email) & never received any response.I certainly expected a machine that cost about ... to last longer! I only used this about 10 times in all the time I had it.Although it did cook well it was just not worth the aggravation.Never again."
4,Tacky advertising - but it works as advertised!,"After over a year of use, we are still happy with our ""Ronco"". Without a doubt, the best use is for rotisserie style chicken. It cooks them quickly, evenly and juicy. Beef products have been a disappointment. It disassembles easily for cleaning. And you really can ""set it - and forget it""!"
1,MAJOR MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"I get better results roasting in the oven than the results from this product. First, the poultry is brined and a high heat is used with roasting. This rotisserie is a major disappointment. One of the reasons it was purchased was to spare the oven. It needs to be cleaned after roasting as the high heat method does cause smoke (does not impact the taste). BUT, better that than inferior results. So, I am back to using high heat roasting that roasts the chicken in an hour. The second reason it was purchased was the ""CLAIM"" it can handle a 15lb turkey. My 13lb turkey was bigger than the rotisserie. WHAT A JOKE!!!!!I will buy another product that has a poultry tower AND roasts in an hour without having the chicken tied ""just right"" and positioned ""just right"" so it doesn't get burned. Granted, it won't roast a turkey but then I'll know that up front when purchasing it. I'm quite angry that this product wasn't even close to how it was presented. Just another snake oil salesman."
1,"If you have an oven or a BBQ, dont bother","Im actually returning it. Id be too embarassed to sell it. For starters, I know how to roast meats/chicken, and despite the ""set it and forget it"" claims, its not simple to use, more trouble than its worth, another gadget to take up counter or closet space. Even when you do the video, read the pamplets, its not easier to use than your oven and a good roasting pan. The item itself is VERY POOR quality manufacturing - an ""easy bake oven"" Rotiserie wanna be. The whole unit is not insulated, and it heats, so you must exercise extreme care. And use near your stove hood, because the smell isnt contained in the item. The concept is good, but the item is just a waste of money."
1,Ronco ST4000 Rotisserie,"It burns meat, even when tied down properly. The first time I used it, my chicken went up in flames!!! I was outside shoveling snow. I wasn't even outside that long! You can't set it and forget it, you have to watch it (carefully). After that, I got up enough courage to use it again, and there is no way to set the temperature on the unit. I don't like chicken that is burnt. Even if you take it out faster, it stills burns it. I also hate all the cleanup. You have to wipe the entire unit down (even when you put foil in the drip tray). The regular oven is still the best way. I am an experienced cook (cooking for over 25 years (people love my cooking and ask me for recipes, and ask how I make my dishes) and hate all the cleanup with this unit. It takes up alot of space on the counter if you don't have any counter space."
4,Great tasting chicken,"We had never heard of this product before a friend made us a chicken one day, which tasted great (like the supermarket rotisserie take-out). We bought one the next day and have used it frequently since, but only cooked chicken so far. It is easy to use and cleans up easily. Some things to know: You need to inject the chicken with marinade to get the best flavor. You will get your hands greasy handling the chicken and putting it on the spit. It cooks one chicken better than two (it's hard to get the center of the chickens cooked with two on the spit). The kids like to watch it cook and turn (which helps explain the quality of TV), and it makes the house smell great.Definitely worth buying if you like this kind of cooking."
4,Get it and Set it!,This is my second rotisserie. Great product. I wore my first one out. Making Kebabs are better than throwing them on the grill because sometimes things fall off the skewers.....not so with the Showtime.
3,Loved the turkey,"Cooked a 12lb turkey - it fit but barely. The meat was juicy and full of flavor although the injector was not used. The product cooks large items like prime rib, turkey, chickens and roasts the best. Cooked two hamburgers in the basket and the cleanup was not worth it! If the basket is used, more than 6 pieces of the unit has to be cleaned. Found directions lacking for the steamer tray. The vegetables don't steam long enough if the unit is used for a half hour or less. The product is well made and it does get hot. Keep away from children."
1,customer service/warranty,"Received Plat 5000 as gift. Kabob rods missing. Sent letter and warranty card to Ronco as stated by Cust Svs. They lost card/denied ever receiving, will not honor warranty to send missing 8 kabob rods at their expense, told me to return rotis. to store; store will not honor without sales slip for exchange. I will not ask my bosses wife for receipt. First time a Co. did not honor a warranty after 5 attempts to contact and resolve. Am taking back and going to try for credit and will use on any other brand available."
2,poor QC,This product is barely useable. the turn signal switch doesn't automatically turn off when turning left( the release arm is too short and doesn't engage the release) the lights will sometimes stay on for a few seconds after switching off. ( sticks on)however it does work and the price wasn't too bad.
2,Unstoppable,"That Hollywood can afford to produce such rubbish and, talk quality Actors into submitting to the script, is amazing. Both Snipes and Jacquelyn Obradores are very talented actors wasted on this foolishness."
3,SNIPE HUNTING,"In spite of its derivativeness and lack of true cinematic flair, UNSTOPPABLE is enjoyable and has some good things to recommend it:*Mark Sheppard and Kim Coates as an Abbott and Costello-style hit men duo, whose stone faced seriousness adds unintended camp;*Jacqueline Obradors does well as a gritty cop who doesn't take guff from bad government agents;*Wesley Snipes who will more than likely enter the aging action hero group of stars like Steven Seagal, Jean Claude van Damme and others, doesn't require much suspension of belief in his hallucinogenic stupor;Stuart Wilson is fun in his ""Let's try and act like Rip Torn"" villain role.It's all mindless froth but it kept me interested in spite of its flaws."
1,INCOMPREHENSIBLE!!!,"Hope and pray that your professor is awesome, because the explanations in this book are absolutely incomprehensible. Also, some of the hints in the exercises are ridiculous, such as ""Be careful when you do this"" and ""Think carefully""!!! Is the author implicitly saying that the rest of the problems can be done while being careless, or what?P.S. I'm obviously not a kid ... just didn't want to login for writing this review."
5,No problems,"This unit has many adjustments for custom settings. I found the default factory setting being quite perfect. This way it is just a ""plug in"" out of the box. All you have to do is transfer the wiring. It worked well for one year since I got it. Did it year around as I've got my water heater as secondary, i.e. like separate heating zone. I can say I am quite satisfied with that purchase."
3,Swann DIY Security Camera w/Bonus Wide Angle Lens,This is a good camera for tight places. The wide angle lens could be a little more wide angle.
