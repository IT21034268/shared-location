1,Not Classic... Just Old and Outdated...,"The scholarship is so old you can almost smell the mildew when reading the pages. It's all been surpassed by contemporary scholarship, which still oftentimes suffers from ""Orientalist"" thinking (i.e. Bernard Lewis).If you want to find a tome that critiques Islam at least do yourself a favor and find something more up to date."
1,Poor and Offensive Scholarship,"Put simply, a horrible book. There are clearly reasons nobody has read these essays in 50 years. The scholarship is outdated and the editor is polemically opposed to Islam. These do not add up to a good critical evaluation, much more of which is needed on the origins of the written text of the Qu'ran."
3,sugary song that gets sticky,"The first few times you hear ""I Never Loved You Anyway"", you like it a lot, but it gets dull really fast and eventually tiresome. Still, the Corrs are excellent on their other work, and keep up what they can on this. Still, this song was destined for a B-Side, so why headline it?"
5,Nicest rolling pin!,"I've had a marble rolling pin that I received as a wedding gift. It's all I ever used. My oldest son kept asking for a wooden one. So, when I saw this on Amazon, I was very interested. I love it. So easy to use, hardly need to flour it, and I use it with my Fox Run Silicone Mat. Works great!"
5,"Does the job. Great ""build"" quality.",It is a smooth stick. It did the job I wanted it to do and has been doing so without fail. I would buy it again.
5,Works wonderful!,I just finished baking a huge batch of bread loaves. I could not have done it without this roller. The dough never sticks to it and it is long enough for all my baking needs!
5,better than expected,"I read about this rolling pin in Bon Appetit magazine, but given the price was not expecting that much. It really does work perfectly for crusts & cookies. Much more control than my marble rolling pin!!"
2,Should have done better research,"History for Idiots tries to be factual but it seems the author didn't know how to distinguish fact from fiction. For example, while he's right about some of the popes' lives, he gets it wrong in several places, in particular about ""Pope Joan"" whom all reputable historians rightly regard as a myth. So the reader ends up wondering how much more of the book is factually in error.The format is amusing though. It's just a pity the research wasn't thorough. A much better book on the papacy is Patrick Madrid's ""Pope Fiction""."
3,"Great Illustrations, Horribly Adapted","I was looking for storybooks with wonderful illustrations for my 4 year old, who happily listens to chapter books but wants to examine pictures while listening. The Narnia books were one of my favorite series growing up, so I thought I'd give this one a try. The pictures are definitely great. However, the text is horrible. The way the story is adapted makes it disjointed and makes the characters all sound, frankly, stupid. What I have done is to read my actual unabridged version to my son and have him look at the pictures in this book. I would recommend this if you're just looking for great pictures, but not otherwise."
2,Not What I Expected,"For what you get, this is a good story. But, I thought I was buying the book in it's entirity. I guess I need to read between the lines."
4,It is small book nicely written.,"It is a small book nicely written. But with the price, it scares everybody away. One of the sections in this book is particularly useful for illustrating the technique of implementing non-linear calculation of heat transfer. I learned a great deal from there."
5,This book is great.,"This book is simply great, for the quotations and for the authors cited.Many thanks to the editors."
2,Not useful for me.,"This book is useful if you want to take magenta pictures with a magenta filter, or blue pictures with a blue filter. On the other hand, the parts of the book dedicated to bringing out 'natural' light in photographs is small. It is mainly about creating fancy effects. A photography book should inspire you as you look through and see the photos. This book is full of shots with heavily over-used filtration. Not for me, but if you like more abstract photos, then you might like it."
3,Goofy fun with Ted and Bruce,"Ted Raimi and Bruce Campbell have great fun here along with Stacy Keach in a tale of an American businessman who ends up with part of another man's brain in his skull. There's also his cheating wife, some weird locations in what purports to be Bulgaria, some funny rapping from Ted's character, and cheesy but fun FX."
4,from the mind of Bruce,Bruce Campbell gets 4 stars as a 4 time treat (writer/producer/director/and star) in this fine sci-fi made for tv movie thatdoes a great job following the old-school sci-fi tradition of over the top weirdness.Bruce Campbell can do no wrongEnjoy the movie
3,Bruce Makes An Ash of Himself...,"This is one you're probably better off renting first before you buy. Not awful, but not up to the standards of ""Army of Darkness"" or even ""Bubba Ho Tep"". It starts off slow and never really seems to get going, even though there are a few good laughs every now and then. It helps to have a few beers handy while watching."
1,The Man With The Yawning Brain,"We recieved a copy of this as a free bonus, and frankly feel like we were over-charged. We got about a third of the way through before giving up. Isn't a spoof supposed to be funny? Up to that point there was absolutely nothing funny, or even moderately amusing. Nothing even vaguely resembling entertainment. Unless you count an overdone and heavy-handed ""look what a jerk I'm being"" character, presented with no subtlety or wit as worth watching, avoid this turkey. A much, much more appropriate title would be ""The Man With The Yawning Brain"" Completely dreadful. I wish I could give this trash negative stars. Zero is too high an accolade."
5,Stop Looking At Me,I would just like to say i am a huge bruce campbell fan. I Saw this movie in theaters when he was on his summer of love tour. I thought it was just one of those great cheesy classic bruce movies. I would recomend this movie to anyone who loves Bruce Campbell movie. Hail To The King- The Movie Guy
3,Funny but lacking....,"This was mostly funny but definately had some dry spots. I LOVE Bruce Campbell, but this is not his best movie. It does have merit though. I mean, come on it has a crazy scientist, a corpse gopher, brain transplants into other humans, brain transplants into robots, and Bruce playing a huge jerk. If it's a good deal and you are a fan of Bruce's work, get it. It won't be your favorite, but it's worth checking out and having on your shelf. Just keep your expectations low if all you've seen of his work is Evil Dead and Army of Darkness."
1,This B-flick gets a D,"The king of the one liners pulls off none! No memorable quotes or scenes - nothing really redeeming. It's nice to see Bruce in something new, but it would be nicer to see him in something good. The extras (focusing on how the film came to be) was more interesting than the film. If you like Bruce Campbell, avoid this film - it's tainted my opinion, even if slightly."
2,Not My Favorite Bruce Moment By A Long Shot,"Bruce wrote it, great. Bruce stars in it, sounds like a blast. Unfortunetly I can't say any of this helped the movie much. The movie may be low-budget but so little seems to have been done with...well, so little. The story is out there but isn't supported by a very humorous script to help you forget about it (like Army of Darkness). Maybe the most diehard Bruce fans will enjoy this but I considered myself to be one of the biggest fans and still couldn't jump on the wagon with this one."
4,Great movie for teens and adults,"A librarian friend's review (from the Monroe County Library System webpage):I read once that Spin readers voted Evil Dead II the best movie of the decade. It may have been ten years ago that I saw that poll. Since that time, I've seen all the movies in the Evil Dead series and am now a big Bruce Campbell fan. Bruce Campbell is all that's great about B-movie actors. He's a charismatic ham, aware that he's not the greatest actor in the world so he's just having a good time. You could say the same things about Chuck Norris, the Rock, or any number of action stars, but what Campbell has and they lack is his Looney Tunes sensibility. He looks like a man's man, but he's a goof at heart. He makes his directorial debut with Man with the Screaming Brain (2005) and keys into exactly those qualities fans want in a Bruce Campbell feature. The movie is manic Saturday afternoon sci-fi. It runs along smoothly until an end-of-the-movie chase scene that seems a little tacked on."
3,"Great start, but disappointing ending","Le Guin seems to have grown as a writer as she presents a richer, more complex world, while continuing to ground the story of EarthSea in Taoist ideas of harmony, balance and wholeness, and of course, Magic. Although there is great character development as the suspense builds, the story was ultimately disappointing. The major plotlines are hastily resolved in a few pages at the end! It was as though an ending had been slapped on a story meant to be two or three times longer!"
4,What's in a name?,"Neophytes take note: This is a page-for-page reprint of _The Letters of Ezra Pound, 1907-1941_, edited by D. D. Paige and published by Harcourt in 1950. Only the title has been changed. No need to consult the earlier, more comprehensive-sounding publication if this New Directions edition is readier to hand."
4,"Great little meter, easy to use","Was exactly what I needed. Was hard to find a ""name brand"" meter with the options I needed at this price. This one does everything I need for my job in fire protection. (low voltage stuff). Would recommend paying for the ""name"" stuff if you are going to be using it in the electrical field."
4,A mixture of blues guitar and country,"This album introduced me to Roy Buchanan, and I've heard it many times over (and over). It might seem a real mixture of hard core blues instrumental and country - there are better albums - but the two outstanding tracks ""Green onions"" and ""Ramon's Blues"" are perhaps two of the most popular of Roys tunes and two of the best (Roy shares Ramons Blues with Steve Cropper in one of the best 1,2,3,4 blues guitar solo instrumentals ever). Ok, the other songs don't quite fit but are good by themselves. Get ""the best of"" if you're new to Roy Buchanan, but this album is still good for fans."
1,Bad design,"The bolts for holding the mic clips are in *threaded* holes in this bar instead of spinning freely. What that means is they might as well not spin, because you can't tighten them to hold the mic clips pointing in just any arbitrary direction -- they only tighten up with the clip at one orientation, just like you were threading the clip onto a fixed bolt. Of course, pointing stereo mic is precise directions relative to each other is critical, but the only way to do that with this bar (unless you just get very lucky) is to leave them loose. But then they move out of position easily if you just touch the mic cables. Extremely frustrating and annoying, and the only way to fix it would be to get a couple of those thin nuts like most mic stands have, which can be tightened upward against a mic clip pointing wherever you want it, but I can't seem to find those anywhere. With this stupid design, they should have been included."
1,Poor Coffee,"The coffee lacks body, taste, and aroma. We are generally frugal and throw little away; we will throw this coffee out."
1,Overglorified carpet duster,I bought this for my mother for Xmas.She made me take it back.It barely cleaned her carpets and had as much power as a push along rug cleaner.It did not bounce off furniture as shown and got stuck often.It took 90 minutes to clean one room...not very efficient.If you have pets this items is not for you.
1,Batteries Stink,"We pulled it out of the box, foolowed the instruction to get it charging, waited 12 hours for it to charge, put it on the floor and watched it go. It ran for 5 seconds then stopped. We got a new battery...same thing. Basically dont buy it. Its a piece of junk. DONT BUY IT"
5,Too cool for school,"I have 5 dogs and constantly have to vacuum! Not only does this allow me to do other things, it also entertains the dogs while I am busy elsewhere. They love to bark at it, and chase it while it works. Does great on my hardwoods -- decent on the carpet. I LOVE my Roomba!"
2,I knew it seemed too good to be true...,"I wanted to believe, I really did. When I great read reviews from people that also had long-haired pets like Australian Shepherds and Golden Retrievers, I bought in - and bought it. When it arrived, however, I found that it left alot to be desired. I finally went so far as to sweep my area rug extensively before vacuuming to pick up ""the top layer"" of dog hair so the Roomba wouldn't clog up with hair so readily (after 1-3 uses). I then watched the Roomba roll right over the few hairs that were left - and leave them right there! It even took hairs that were difficult or impossible to see when they were in the main body of the rug and left them at the edge (where they were much more visible). I'm disappointed that I'm going to have to return it and continue to carpet sweep my rugs by hand."
4,No Pins?,"Watch band comes with several different width end pieces to fit the 18mm to 22mm watches as advertised. It did not, however, come with the pins required to attach the band to the watch. That should have been only a minor inconvenience for me because I have a kit containing pins of every available width. However, every pin in my kit turned out to be too ""thick/wide"" to fit through the hole in the last link. I ended up using a small drill to widen the hole just enough to accept the pin."
4,A really fun book,"This book is a fun read for people who like novels about the Royal Navy during the Napoleonic Wars, and it has an interesting twist in that the hero wants to marry a Quaker girl who has to come to terms with her pacifism. If this is the beginning of a series, I will snap up its successors as they emerge."
1,Didn't help at all,"I was having a lot of pain in my tailbone, to the extent that I couldn't sit for more than a few minutes on any surface. I purchased this in the hopes that it would ease the pain. Unfortunately, it was a waste of my money. It didn't help at all. In fact, it seemed to make it even worse. I also found it hard to stay in just the right position--maybe the cover fabric was too slippery, I'm not sure. I had to keep adjusting my position, though, which quickly became tedious. Still, I could have dealt with that...if it had only helped! I wouldn't buy it again."
2,cheap toy guns,"I should know you get what you pay for. But these guns are so cheap! The holster was cracked in the package and I didn't sent it back because it was too close to Christmas. One gun broke quickly out of the package, the trigger stopped clicking. The other gun lasted a little longer then the barrel snapped off."
3,Talk is out!,"Yes, I like this videoFumbling Toward Ecstasy, but that studio talk is too much every time I expected to here a song there she was talking in the studio with other. When I want to listen to video with music that all it should be."
4,"Stress, A Killer DVD","This DVD has been most helpful in explaining how damaging stress can be, and how that affects learning. Used in a doctoral class, it is clear, and admirable for the purpose."
3,"o.k., not great.. dated video",I understand the message but it seemed slow and dated to me. Would have preferred a more detailed explanation of dealing with stress.
2,Not much more than you can see online for free,"I watched the previews and everything I could find online from this guy. I was disappointed to find that the DVD contains very little more than what was available for free on National Geographic's website. Also, you can find him on TED giving a lecture on another topic. He is a great speaker and very interesting man, but this video wasn't worth the money. I suppose I can feel good about paying for something that hopefully went to fund scientific research, or at least some portion of my money went to fund scientific research. I hope he got good royalties because he seems like a cool dude."
4,Not bad...,"This table is cheaper here than anywhere else i've seen it.My children really enjoy it. It arrived pretty quick and the set up wasn't too bad. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is during set up my husband noticed that the legs didn't fit properly in the holes. The water kept leaking out, had to remove legs and force it in hard for a tighter fit to stop the water from leaking out. Other than that, my kids love it. My five year old loves to play with the sand while my 14 month old loves to splash in the water. It's also comes with a couple of boats and some cups to play with."
4,"Good quality, good design","Fun toy, good quality and good design. My one wish would be to have a drain on the sand side of the table. Young children don't keep all the water in the water side, so it would be nice to have a drain to remove the water from the sand side."
1,"flimsy design, poor quality","I bought 2 of these, one meant as a gift. One umbrella clip was damaged, the other broke on the first application. On closer inspection, the umbrella clip is a flimsy piece of plastic with a tiny bump that's supposed to hold up the entire weight of the metal/fabric umbrella.The large cover is difficult to handle and could do with a handle. It is held down by two elastic band that's a hassle to fasten and release. The elastic band will deteriote quickly when it's left outdoors in the sun and rain. A simple latch could have been better.A good idea but poorly designed."
4,Definately An Outside Toy For Us!,"I read all the reviews prior to purchasing this perticular table and I must say, my son loves to splash with this so much theres no way it could be an inside toy without being a huge mess. My son was 1 when he got this and loved splashing in the water! I must admit that the water seems to leak out of the table through the legs just a little bit but as long as its outside its not a big deal. Im also not crazy about the umbrella it came with, its a little plasticky and cheep for me but it does the job of shadding the children. Overall this was the best toy he got for his birthday."
3,The Messy but fun box!,"My son loves this box but the umbrella breakes easy and sand gets in the umbrella hole making it hard to put in unless you digg it out. Also, my son drops the sand in the water and viceversa making it very messy and nasty because the water sits (specially during cold weather) and green mildew would grow around and under the box. So you must drain it after every use and that means that you will go through sand bags like crazy. Overall I wasn't too happy but my son was very happy with it- so I give it a great rating for imagination and fun."
5,She Loves it.,I am very happy with this table. I bought it for my granddaughter and put it up after Christmas. She loves it and has spent many hours playing in it. The quality of the product is excellent and I expect her to use it for many years.
2,How are you REALLY going to use this?,"I bought this for my daughter's first birthday, thinking I would do the sand and water thing together, but actually I ended up buying a sit-in sandpit and separate splash pool just 6 months later, both of which my daughter prefer infinitely. This table is good for making sand castles/pies etc. where you're mixing water and sand together, but if you want to encourage sand and water play as separate activities then this is isn't really the best thing for the job. Also, don't kid yourself like I did that a table would be less messy - it isn't. My daughter loves nothing more than to pour sand and water all over the floor - and herself.For the table itself, our plug in the water side leaks, the whole table sags slightly in the middle so the boats get stuck going round the outside edge and if sand does get in the water side (which it does frequently) it's a nightmare to get it back out again as the plug area is raised above the level of the table bottom."
5,spindles on both sides?,Has anyone used these spindles on both sides of the gate? We have a wrought iron banister and railing. Would I need 2 sets or are these sold as a single item where I would need to order 4?
2,sick,"With no disrespect to the artists on this cd, i was sickened to find that wyclef, who i thought was a socially and musically responsible artist, failed to include a variety of music that was clearly present in the movie. Black music is so diverse (a fact portrayed in the movie) yet this diversity was ignored during production of the cd. spike lee said it best when in the inside cover of the ""x"" soundtrack he wrote ""may we all look forward to the day when Black Radio is as diverse as the music you're listening to here."" i was hoping i could have said the same about this soundtrack."
5,Maxwell what a soulful voice,"This soundtrack i think can be compared to another hot soundtrack by the name of Waiting to Exhale. With songs that sound as if they came straight from the heart. But Maxwell's song ""Fortunate"" took the whole soundtrack by storm. Best wishes to you Maxwell!!!!!!!"
5,Life soundtrack,A great album that everybody has forgotten about. Great jams and some emotional songs to . It moves me.
3,useful,"when you travel it is easier to put all the charges and cords in one place, so as to find at night to charge whatever needs to be charged."
2,Good Sounds. Less songs.,"I went to see this band a few months ago, and was very disappointed with them live. I found the sequencer/backing tracks annoying at the live show. Thinking that maybe the songs didn't translate, I picked up the disc.Long days and Bombshell are very good songs. But the remaining songs are boring dirges. I found myself wondering if they intentionally made them slow and boring, because there were just so many weak tunes.Try the source. Depeche Mode."
4,If you do or don't like Star Wars you should still try it.,"Great game! Fun Fun and more Fun! Star Wars fan or not, you should still get the game. The graphics are great, the game is great, and the sound effects are great!"
3,Menace,"This was a good game i thought if your a star wars fan. The controling seemed easy if you had a controller if you dont have one i recomend you get one. once you beat it once the game gets really easy. overall i think you should get this game for pc, the playstation ones graphics arent as good."
3,its alright,"Its got its hard parts and its got its easy parts. Kinda better then the ""horrible compared to what I expected"" movie, but not by much"
5,Saved a foturne,"The cymbal pack is great for Led Zepplin style rock and roll, not your heavy metal, but rock, jazz, Beatles type music these are great cymbals."
5,Puccini's Turandot,"Indeed, this book reinforced what I always maintained: that Puccini was the heir to Verdi going down the line of great Italian opera composers all the way back to Monteverdi in 1600. But after Turandot and Puccini's death in 1924, who was the heir apparent? It was then and still is obvious in 2013 that no one composer took the mantel from Puccini. The great Italian operatic tradition ended with Turandot. Well researched and well analyzed."
3,not too bad stories but ALOT of type errors,"The short stories were pretty good, although the poetry was lame. And there were tons of type errors and grammer errors. It seems that this publishing company is in MAJOR need of a real editor."
5,Great guitar mic holder!,"I bought this item after having a singer come to our church and use it as his guitar mic holder. You can screw this on to any standard mic stand as opposed to using another mic stand. I had a very hard time finding it in any of my catalogs, but here it is!"
2,Good for light weight stuff,I tried it for iPad. It kinda wobbles up and down. It has a light strip of metal without a bracing design so it flaps up and down when something heavy is attached to the end such as my iPad. I only recommend it for something light weight. There's better ones out there. See my review on the music stand. That comes with a solid extension arm...
5,An invaluable reference tool for any Southwestern writer or student,"I recently wrote a book about the history of the towns of New Mexico's Sandia Mountains, and during that time I probably picked this book up two or three times every day.It is invaluable--loaded with obscure words that no normal Spanish-English dictionary would ever have. It's well-structured, nicely organized, clearly printed, thorough, and as complete as you would ever need it to be.In its way, it's a sort of linguistic and cultural history of New Mexico and southern Colorado, disguised as a dictionary. Leaf through it and glance at a few words and definitions, and you can't help but learn fascinating things about the people and the places that produced these terms.If you are a New Mexico student or scholar or writer, you really NEED to have this book. Your work will be incomplete without it."
4,"Not Part of the ""Fishyness""","I did not believe any of the previous reviews mentioned because it's easy to tell the same person(s) wrote them. I am not from this club, so in truth, it's a decent workout. It is edited (towels, water bottles, weights, ball are in different places from one section to another) to push the viewer to her max. I take small stretching breaks to balance out the intensity. What I don't like about it is the instructor's voice, and when she says, ""10 more"" she really means 15, ""4 more"" really means 8. If you have enough sense to do your own thing, you will find it worthwhile."
3,Good but too much talking,I like this workout because it will cause you sweat! I still can't complete the entire workout without stopping and taking a quick break. I give it 3 stars because the instructor talks a little too much for me and the pop-ups can get annoying.
3,too complicated!,i thought this was going to be more cross stitch due to my googling of the items on amazon but it turned out to be needlepoint and its crazy complicated
4,I get a lot of compliments on these...,"Everyone coments on these magnets when they come over. The only issue I had was when I got them in mail the actually magnet part was dislodged in 2 of the tiles, but a little glue solved the issue easily."
1,Technicality and Tidbits,"Please keep in mind this review is by someone who does not have ANY interest in African Art. Nonetheless, the book is pretty technical, and I have to say, boring, and difficult to understand. It did fail to grab my attention in any way.On a more positive note, it does offer many pictures, though small, of many art pieces, mostly sculptues and carvings. Also, it mentions some famous African Sculptures and African peoples who you may not have heard about."
5,Glad it's remastered,I had this one in vinyl back in the 70's. You just can't get much better of what was being played over the airwaves back then when I was a teenager. I'm glad it's remastered. Has all the songs I want from this power-pack of talent I grew up on.
4,Helplessly hoping for more.,"""Crosby Stills and Nash (and Young)"" are a case of having one collection (this one) that's too skimpy, and another one (""Carry On"") that's too expensive. But they don't have one that's just right, meaning a single disc with 15-20 tracks including songs from their entire career remastered. This is a wonderful disc, and a great start, but there are numerous other songs that could be added to this, specifically ""Wasted on the Way"" and ""Southern Cross"". At least I have those on vinyl. And as much as I love Neil, something that focused more on CSN would be nice. We, and they, really deserve it."
4,Great album from a classic rock band,They need to release a more complete hits album (pre plus post '74) but this will do for now. The band at their strongest. Each song is a classic and the music still holds up today. (Especially on the CSNY2K tour.) I have never heard a band with as strong vocal harmonies as CSNY had. Powerful stuff! If you are new to the group or are a casual fan of the singles this is the disc to get! CSN&Y Forever!
3,Better the first time,"Of course all the songs on this record are great. But dont waste your time on a greatest hits album with these artists. CSN&Y's Deja Vu album and the CSN first album are incrdeible. Along with Neil Young's solo albums, you will be glad you bought those albums instead of an unnecessary greatest hits package"
3,Excellent when you're able to get a satellite signal!,"This is a good value for the money. Obviuosly there are units that perform way better according to other reviews, but they cost significantly more.Pros: I love the screen on this unit the image is very clear and sharp. The voice prompt is also excellent - loud and clear. Finding an address is a breeze. I find the favorites and Go Home features particularly very helpful.Cons: Aquiring satellite signal is a major issue with this unit. This is the only reason I find it hard to give a higher rating. I drive almost the same route to and from work everyday and my unit loses and regains satellite signals about 4 or five times on each trip. Sometimes it never regains the signal for the rest of the trip. This could be a major pain if you lose satelite signals on a trip you're not familiar with."
2,slow in connecting with satellite,"I had a factory-installed GPS in my car, which I crashed, and liked it much better than this Garmin. My brother also has this same one and has the same problem. It takes FOREVER to connect with the satellite. I am not very happy with it and wish I had my car back that had it factory-installed. I do realize that it was more expensive that way, but now I only use the Garmin when I really have to. Also, my son has it in Honolulu, HI and their Garmin does not get satellite coverage there at all, so they can't even use it. That is very disappointing for him too."
3,Slow acquiring satellite signal,"I purchased my 250W a couple months ago. In several occasion the GPS device failed to acquire signal within a few minutes. There were a few times when it took up to 15 minutes for it to find signal, even under clear sky outdoor. Once the signal is acquired, it is always 4/5 bars and very stable, which only makes the problem to find signal even more baffling. It was really annoying at times because it essentially forced me to ""warm up"" the unit before I start driving.I have just updated the firmware of the unit, and it ""seems"" like my 250W is locating signals a lot faster. I will test it in other locations to verify whether the problem is fixed permanently. Even if it does, a GPS device should have satellite signal problem to begin with, so I could only give it a 3-star rating."
5,Garmin 250W Nuvi,"Great product. Very easy to use. No instruction book really needed. Unlike others I have had, entering where you want to go on this unit is simplicity itself. It's all intuitive. It has a bright screen that is easily read in sunlight, but a ""dimmer"" for night driving would make it better. You won't go wrong (or get lost) if you get this GPS."
1,Garmin Nuvi 250w buyer beware!!!!!!!!,"Garmin nüvi 250W 4.3-Inch Widescreen Portable GPS NavigatorI was so happy to get my new garmin but when i opened it i found that it did not work at all. Spent much of my time trying to contact the bogus seller with a bogus e-mail. Now i am trying to get in touch w amazon about this and a lot of good that has done me, not!!!! over $200.00 down the drain. If you buy this and it is DOA your on your own!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Never again will i buy anything from amazon!!!"
1,NEVER RECIEVED,I'm not sure who the seller was but I was billed for this product and it was NEVER RECIEVED
4,A Strong Follow-Up,"Though not the seamless work that is LITTLE EARTHQUAKES, Tori Amos' second album is nonetheless a strong entry in her stellar catalog. Though her piano work was featured prominently on her debut, she expands on her use of that instrument here, framing many of her compositions around the piano, resulting in more spare arrangements for the bulk of the album. 'Pretty Good Year' begins the proceedings, and remains my favorite track on the album--simple, yet beautiful. Amos goes slightly tribal on the second track 'God', in which she chastises God for not always coming through on situations. It's a bold statement, especially coming from a preacher's daughter. She also manages to add some slight tongue in cheek humor, especially on tracks like 'The Wrong Band', and contemplates killing a 'Waitress'on another. All in all, a very strong record."
4,nice and dependable,"so far, so good....unfortunately, the auto-light function doesn't really seem to work...other than that, it serves its purpose."
3,A Bit Dark and Hard But Generally Good,"Sir Steve's recent release took a bit to warm up to. I really liked To Watch the Storms and it was easier to like those songs right away as they had more ""hook"" in them. Wild Orchids has a dark feel to it and requires repeated listening at which time you'll find a few gems.I'll never forget seeing Steve at his recent acoustic tour and then actually meeting him afterwards. I feel acoustic still is his strong point and there was not evenough of it on this album. still, there are enough interesting songs to warrant a purchase.Joe"
4,cute and cuddly,"the set was very cute and soft, the only thing i didn't really like about it was a couple of the little decals where kind of scratchy, but after i washed it a few times it was fine."
4,A good purchase,"I don't think there is any way to go wrong here, this is a nice pocket bible. Very prompt service. Thanks."
5,Higelin - none better,"A wonderful blend of madness, excentricity and fun. The lyrics will have you in stiches and the music will lift your spirits.Take it, play it, love it."
2,Not the greatest movie,This movie was okay but it was missing something. This is a movie I woldn't see again but it was not terrible.
4,"OK, not life shattering","I was excited to get this book, but found it slightly dissapointing. It was nice that the author is honest and admits to needing to get away from her kids and that they can drive her crazy at times. Most moms these days will not admit to that. The book did not really tell me anything I had not learned already from other parenting books. But all in all it was a good read."
5,So inspiring and helpful,"This book was given to me by my M.I.L and it is a book that is inspiring and uplifting. When it comes to raising kids there is no handbook, but this book is as close to what a hand book would look like."
5,The Story of Light,"I admit to prejudice.I have known Bova for some time and share his views on many things, still I found this to be one of the best text/references I have ever seen.It is certainly worth a look for any Parent unhappy with some of the lowest common denominator school dreck and seeking answers to questions like 'why do the stars shine' and 'why is the sky blue' add to that answers FAR beyond why we sometimes feel sad on a rainy day and you have a wonder of information at hand to answer questions for both the small people and yourself. Comprehensible all the way through.Highly recommended."
2,unreliable,"It was a beautiful soft plush, lovely blue color, but the control was erractic. On the first night it didn't heat much. I put it on high and it remained slightly warm on both sides of a Queen. Plush also makes the wires conspicous. I returned it the next day.Pat"
1,Better product than Sunbeam electric blankets,"Athough I've only had this product since Christmas, it already seems like something that will serve me well for a few years or more. I've been very disappointed by the Sunbeam blankets these last 10 years or so ; that's why I sought out a different brand. So far , so good. Nice and warm with good temp control. I like the color, too. ******** Follow-up Report (Nov 2011): Sad to say that this electric blanket has been a disappointment. It was NOT laundered but rather it was carefully stored in the linen closet during the warmer months. Now it is chilly again and I expected it to work as well as the first few months ....... but NOTHING. No warmth except in one little strand ...... 90% of it stays stone cold."
1,Smoked and burnt up on first use! Shocked my mother!,I gave this to my mother for Christmas and the first time she used it she could smell something strange then she started to see smoke coming out of the switch. she went to shut it off and it shocked her.Pro's : looks like it would work.Con's : Doesnt work can start fires or possibly shock your mother.
2,Total Let Down .two thumbs down,"Don't let the name or the details on the back of the box fool you.It has very little to do with Medellin or the 1980s cocaine empire.Its an alright movie that focuses on petty drug dealing in Colombia and what happens to a honest man who attempts to do business with these petty dealers.You can tell whoever made this movie did not do any research on the criminal world they are trying to portray in this film, Over all its just something to watch when you got nothing else to do.I DON'T RECOMMEND THIS FILM TO ANYONE WHO IS A FAN OF MAFIA/GANGSTER FILMS."
1,Another mediocre exploitation movie about Medellin,"It's so easy to work with stereotypes and clichés about the city of Medellin. These help sell books, newspapers, TV shows and even films such as this one. But that myth of the murder capital of the world, the drug kingpins and coke covering the hillsides is a myth from 25 years ago, no longer a reality.It's funny that it's actually some colombian filmmakers who insist on exploiting that dark chapter in the city's history. Move on..."
3,"Dry, dated book, but good for some info.","Although dry and somwht dated, I recommend this book for any/ all Secret Service enthusiasts out there. Of particular note is the confirmation of the role of Chief Inspector Michael W. Torina as author of the Secret Service's manual.Vince Palamara-JFK/ Secret Service expert (History Channel, author of two books, in over 30 other author's books, etc.)Pittsburgh, PABEST JFK ASSASSINATION BOOK: ULTIMATE SACRIFICEBEST JFK SECRET SERVICE BOOK: SURVIVOR'S GUILT BY YOURS TRULY :)"
3,"time honored, industry proven","If your looking for a book on time honored, industry proven special effects this is the book for you. If you want to expand your knowledge and understanding of basic principles and historic technique this is the book for you. This book has helped me understand how effects have become what they are today.However, if you're looking for a book that will immediately address modern computer generated effects look elsewhere. If you're looking for a book that will give you a clear insight into the state of the industry today look elsewhere. If you're looking for a book that will spell out /outline what a modern VFX college course is designed to teach you look elsewhere.I'm not a professional. I'm just a student aggressively searching for knowledge and this book is packed full of it. So I force myself to keep reading wile I dream of a book that dynamically outlines the nuts and bolts of modern effects technology."
4,Nighty Night baby!,If you are looking for something a little quieter for bedtime or naptime this is a great choice. The music and images are very calming and it has become part of my daughter's daily routine after lunch. Within a few minutes she's snuggled up to her stuffed animal on the floor and snoozing. I can't say it has any actual educational value but for chilling a bay out it is excellent!
4,This Jersey Was a Gift for Someone Else.,The item arrived sooner than I expected. The jersey was intact when I received it. It was a gift for someone. The receipient was grateful for the jersey and thanked me for it.
3,Not the best,"My [..] loved the Baby Genius children's songs DVDs so I purchased this thinking it would be a hit also. This one is not the same as the others. It is mostly just animals from the zoo with a classical music score. It is pleasant to watch and listen to, but it doesn't keep their attention for very long. The kids really prefer the videos with a lot of action and other children to watch."
1,Won't stay attached to the tile!,If you need this to be attached to the tile with suction cups - do not buy this! It won't stay attached for long and if you do try your luck make sure you don't put anything breakable in it. If it falls which it eventually will it will break!
2,Great Info but hard to follow,"The information in the book is worth 10 times the price. Stuff i never saw in 6 years of TKD. But i had to watch the video to get what the pictures were trying to show. The pictures in the book are really poorly done. Get the video, if you like it and want more then get the book."
5,Excellent Book on Dim-mak !!!,"This is a great book on Dim-mak - very interesting and informative. A must read for the serious martial arts disciple. I have liked it so well that I have included in my Listmania! ""Secret Self Defense"".Master Dutch Hinkle, author of ""Secret Buttons of the Hand: -21- Attack Stopping Pressure Points of the Hand"""
3,"Not bad, but not great","The lanyard seems to be well constructed and durable. However, it isn't one continuous loop, it's actually held together with velcro at the back of the neck, which gets itchy and irritates my skin. I had to remove the velcro and have the wife sew it together. Other than that, it's great."
2,Ehh.,"I really did not like this product. It velcroed in the back and got caught in my hair :( It was not a smooth feeling lanyard. I feel bad saying this, but it was just not for me."
4,Pretty Good for the Price,I really like this lanyard and use it everyday. However the only reason this is not a 5 star review is becuase they fail to inform you that it is not a solid piece and it is connected by velcro which comes apart very easily. I simply removed the velcro and had the ends sewed together. Not really a big deal. They just need to add that to the description.
4,Thick and durable,"Really like the lanyard. Made out of thick, durable fabric so I won't have to keep replacing it. Just wish it could be adjusted so it doesn't hang so low since I'm kinda short :)"
3,Addition By Subtraction?,No Neil this time. The remaining trio released this CD during the height of disco when the singer/songwriters were definitely out of fashion. This seems to be a more calculated affair and the music suffers as a result. There are some nice songs on this CD but the music lacks the edge that was present on the first two albums.
5,Peter Gabriel - POV,"I have been a huge fan of P. Gabriel since forever. The P.O.V. concert I think was one of his best. He's in his prime, a great band backing him up and a few surpries sets this concert apart from the rest!I only wish this came in DVD form. It only comes (if you can find it) in VHS!!!"
5,"Great size, sturdy construction","I bought this bag for my 13 year old sports nut of a son. He's using it for both school and basketball, so he carries books and shoes.. it's not too big that it won't fit in his locker, but it's big enough that everything fits and doesn't strain the zipper. He loves it!"
1,Simply Awful,"This isn't a good sequal to DAY OF THE DEAD.This isn't a good horror film.This isn't a good film.This is stupid.This is boring.This is awful.Everyone associated with this mess should be ashamed of themselves, the ""directors"" in particular. It is a cheap looking, poorly made, amateurish atrocity that is an insult to horror fans everywhere."
1,Don't Buy It !,Don't buy it. Don't even spend your precious time on watching it. I guarantee you will be utterly disappointed.
2,Don't use other people's work in order to promote your own,"Don't de fooled by the title, this movie has nothing to do with any of the Dead Films. This movie is about space zombies that have a higher thought process than the reqular run of the mill zombies. They have a telepathic link to each other, morph into spacelike creatures after eating human flesh, and make regular zombies by biting and killing people. If I was George I would be seriously pissed off for this movie being related in any way, shape, or form to his series. I did give this film two stars for at least being a somewhat creative prospective towards the zombie genre. Honestly though if you want to make a film don't cling it to the title of someone elses work unless you know what you are doing. That's one reason this movie is pissing so many off. Cheesiness aside."
1,Avoid at all costs,"Sometimes a bad movie can be ""fun"" if you know what I mean, but this is so bad you can't even laugh at it. Mostly I felt sorry for the people ""acting"" in it. Sad, sad, sad. I'm glad George Romero had nothing to do with this. Not even worth a rental.0 stars out of 5."
5,It Works!!!!,I've owned this video since 1993. At that time I weighed 260lbs. With proper diet and the daily use of this video I lost 110lbs. Then I had my first child and gained 60lbs. Went right back to the video and lost 40lbs. Then I had my second child now I'm back to the video. It works but you need to be self motivated so that you do it at least six days a week.
1,BETTER AS A POOL THAN A SANDBOX!!!!,"I AGREE W/ THE OTHER REVIEWS.....EVEN THOUGH IT MIGHT MAKE A NICE ADDITION TO YOUR YARD...I SPENT MORE TIME TELLING MY SON TO STAY AWAY FROM IT THEN TO PLAY IN IT!!!! IT FILLED UP W/ TONS OF RAIN WATER, GRASS CLIPPINGS AND MADE A NICE SPOT FOR INSECTS TO HANG OUT IN. THE LID DIDN'T WORK RIGHT FROM THE GET-GO. I ENDED UP GETTING RID OF ALL THE SAND AND FILLED IT UP AS A LITTLE POOL WITH WATER ON REALLY HOT DAYS!!!"
5,"The true story of ""Exodus""","If Leon Uris had been a foreign correspondent following the human effects of WWII, and if he had been posted in the Mediterranean, and if he had been a Jewish woman writing for a New Your paper, and he had witnessed the atrocities imposed by the British forces on Displaced Persons (read: Jews) trying to get to the Promised Land -- well, he would have been Ruth Gruber, and his book would be this one: Destination Palestine.Required reading for anyone who thought Paul Newman looking hungry and tired was the worst that took place on the SS Exodus. Ruth Gruber was there as a witness to deaths in Haifa and the refusal of the British Navy to allow the Exodus to allow her passengers to disembark. She followed the DPs to Cyprus and Southern France, with plans for their ultimate return to the holdings pens of Germany.This book is the real thing. A non-stop page-turner of the true story behind the Hollywood version."
1,It lacks real deployment requirements,Luckily other more pragmatic books on the GSM Evolution topic are becoming available
3,Not for certain types of diarrhea,"I bought this product for my mother who had surgery and was having diarrhea because they removed part of her small intestine. For diarrhea due to those reasons, it is not effective, though it did relieve her cramps."
4,Recent journey,"Just returned from a trip to the Holy Land and found ""Where Jesus Walked"" to be very helpful. I read one other book before the trip, so the two complimented each other very well. The other was very factual and this one added more spiritual insight. Even had a chance to share it with the tour guide, who learned something new."
4,Maxell Rewritable DVD+RW (15 pack),"I have used these discs for years and have been very pleased with them. When they became unavailable in local stores I purchased six packs of them from Amazon. More than half of them were unformattable--giving the signal THIS DISC CANNOT BE FORMATTED--THE DISC IS DIRTY--CANNOT DISPLAY TITLE LIST FOR THIS DISC. Even the ones I succeeding in formatting sometimes stopped while recording and displayed C1300, making it necessary for me to follow a procedure to put my recorder into RECOVERY to be able to extract the disc from the player. I know the fault is not with the recorder because I use two different recorders. I am still testing the ones that gave no problems in formatting, and hope to be able to use at least half of my purchase. I have no idea what the problem is--if anybody out there knows, please tell Amazon. Thank you, Amazon, for the opportunity to tell you about this problem."
2,DISSAPOINTED!!,"i bought this book because im very interested on columbine's facts etc.so i thought this book was going to be shocking or exiteing, or at least had something to do with columbine.well the book starts talking about her, wich u think is ok, because u'll read her side of the storybut she really starts with the God thing, and family support, and being a bad girl, and being a good girl, etc etc.what she talks a bout columbine is so....nothing....i mean u can even think that she made it up. because she doesn't show her real feelings and she doesnt write about consecuences or so. at the end she just talk about God, her religion etc etc....."
4,Hot French rock.,"I was on my first visit to France and I went into a record store to buy Ca Plane Pour Moi, by Plastic Bertrand, which was a big hit at the time (we're talking the punk era here). The guy who served me said, you don't want that [...], you want something decent, and he recommended this Telephone disc. I bought it on spec, and am so glad I did - it was my introduction to probably France's best rock/punk band. Melodic and intense, this is intelligent music for people who want more than a mindless pop song."
1,Worst Customer Support!,"I haven't used this card, so this is a review of this company. It has the worst customer support I have every experienced. Their web site is a joke. Their support hours are incredibly short. They have support only from 8AM to 5PM during week days. Frankly, I can't afford to stay at home because they made a defective card."
2,Dove Bros review,"the quartet is simply not a good one - ragged, not blended, average voices,etc. Not much of a tribute to Mosie."
2,The Heart of tha streetz vo1. 2 really isn't it.,"The Heart of tha streetz ** Stars.B.G.'s follow to the heart of tha streetz is a dissappointment, I Have great respect for B.G. Formally of cash money and his accomplishments, but his album is confused and predictable and really quite silly, although there are so good songs on there, the rest just doesn't do anything justice for me, New Orleans bounced back from katrina and Juvenile's new album, but this has a lyrics that are full of holes and the writing is too overrated.The Beats are impressive, but what is the album trying to say?Thumbs down."
5,Quincy Jones makes great music for all ages!!!,"Everyone knows Quincy Jones' contributions to making ""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", and ""Bad"" for Michael Jackson, but what a lot of jazz fans know is that Mr. Jones also knows how to put together a excellent album!! This album, from 1989, shows Jones at his finest: while incorporating the latest (for 1989) contemporary sounds and Hip-Hop elements, while keeping the music listenable and timeless for all to enjoy, whatever their age.I would also highly recommend the album that Jones did in 1980 with George Benson, ""Give Me The Night"", for another fun jazz album."
1,why is this game so BAD?,whoever wants to buy this game please dont. if you rent it thats fine but the game is lousy.once your done with the game you would never want to play it again.
3,"You've seen the movie, now play the frustrating game!","""The Phantom Menace"" is by no means a horrible game, but it could have been a lot better. The graphics are a bit clunky, but the sound is outstanding. Control in some respects is good, but most of the time, especially when jumping, it can get a bit frustrating. This is to say nothing of the odd 3/4 above view that only makes control that much more difficult.Other than that, I had fun with the game. Playing the Jedi characters and going around hacking away at droids did have its moments. Big Star Wars fans will get some enjoyment out of this game, moreso if they're video game nuts as well. Casual gamers, or Star Wars fans who don't play many video games, will grow frustrated with this game and wonder why they spent the money.Pick it up on the clearance rack like I did."
1,don't even bother,This was flat out one of the worst games that I have ever encountered for the Playstation. The graphics are weak and the gameplay is just plain boring. I rented this game and turned it off after about 15 minutes of boredom.
3,Neither good nor bad,"This game is pretty good (except when you kill Jar-Jar Binks the game tells you you've done a BAD thing and have to start the level again!). Anyway, its pretty good but not in any way addictive. Star wars fans will like it but I just want the cheat codes so I can finish the thing as quick as possible."
4,A challenging game that is very fun!,A good game for problem solvers it took me a month to beat it without the guide. It is fun but if you get stuck it is hard to get out of the place. It is fun partly because you get to play 4 different people.
2,The Fetid Menace,"Let's start off with what's good about this: there's an extended, behind-the-scenes look at the movie, which even includes a line from Darth Maul that was evidently edited out. The city of Mos Espa, easily the largest and most immersive of the levels, is quite fun, including at least one hidden subgame (a Jawa shooting gallery), and the levels preceeding it are decent training runs on the following levels.Unfortunately, that's not all there is to the game. Puzzles which consist of not being hit, jumping to platforms (which, due to the obnoxious camera angles, may or may not be close enough to land on), and keeping suicidal characters alive drop the game's fun considerably. What's worse is the absolutely terrible voice acting, and the script that goes with it (my, but that Darth Maul is suddenly a chatty fellow). Had this game not borne the Star Wars logo, its destiny would be that of a small, unaspiring game. It's a good rental choice for the first couple levels, though."
2,"Fun, but I don't believe it's worth owning","I feel a little ripped with this thing. I like the design, comfort of useability, but my wife and I easily went through half our steels in one use. We are inexperienced and practicing, yes, but some salesman for these said they were supposed to create more fires that a whole box of matches. It's a fun, primitive experience, but if you are going to go fire steel, I recommend a fatter open dowel one. Otherwise, if you are going for waterproof fire, just ziplock a bic."
2,incorrect product description,I bought this item based on it said it was 8 ounces. It was only 1 3/8 ounces. I would have been better off buying the Emergency Fire Starter by SE for a third less money and at least you get the hacksaw blade with it.
1,Buy a LIGHTER Instead...,"I remember back in Boy Scouts during Grizzly Adams training, and after a long lecture on how with this tool, your knife, and the clothes on your back you could stay alive practically forever. It always struck me that a much more logical tool for lighting a fire is a simple cigarette lighter. Instead of keeping a chunk of flint or magnesium in your survival kit, why not just throw in 3 or 4 plastic lighters? I'm not a smoker but I've got lighters I bought in 1985 that still work like I just bought them yesterday. Why not teach a kid to 'flick his bic' instead? Are we afraid he'll start smoking (oh dear). Well, maybe that's not such a bad idea. All these super-fat kids are the result of cigarette commercials being outlawed anyway. And if he was a smoker chances are he'd never leave home without something to start a fire with...namely, a LIGHTER!"
2,It's not REALLY a Dell!,"The product description indicates that it is an original Dell product. I read the other review, and that customer was well pleased, and got an original Dell product. I however, got a cheap knock-off made by some other company. The product works, and it does fit my computer, but I am not at all pleased with the fact that the seller specifically presented this as an original Dell product, when it is NOT."
3,Boring but calming,"I have other videos by baby genius and I think they are more engaging. This video of underwater images and lots of fish and sea life but it's set to classical music and as an adult I thought it was boring. My daughter (2 year old) likes sea life and watched the colorful displays. It was very calming for her. I think she liked it. It might be good for end of the day watching to settle down, but for parents it can be boring."
4,Great Service at Fisher-Price,"I purchased this product for Christmas and had some difficulty programming the product. In attempt to solve the problem with my product, I logged on to the Consumer Relations website (service.mattel.com) and was able to get service online and the parts I needed to get my product working."
2,disappointment,"just like most of the other reviews i have read, we had alot of trouble getting this thing to work. didn't work with either of ours or at grandmas house or at other places we tried. finally we ended up buying another cheap dvd player just hoping it would work for our 2 and a half year old. finally a winner out of several different dvd players! VERY annoying that we had to buy a dvd player just for this toy. my daughter loves it though. but she does get frustrated because it usually only works right for a little while then it doesn't read the correct show for what card she puts it. then i have to take the dvd out and restart everything for it to work a little longer. i wouldn't recomend this toy,although it is fun when it actually does what it is suppose to. but extremely frustrating!"
1,Interactv - disappointing,"I was extremely disappointed in this item as it was extremely slow in responding, stuttered when you wanted to move ahead and was generally not very entertaining unless your child is very young and easily occupied."
5,"Great Idea , Great Buy, Great Fun","I purchaed this toy for my 3&4 year old on 11/12/05. They have played with it every time the TV is on. We purchased the SpongeBob, Dora and Barney DVD's and all work great. They enjoy playing SpongeBob the best since they can just pick the card they want to play, rather then Dora and Barney where they have to go in order (cards 1,2,3). The setup process is not hard if you just choose the manuel setup proceedure. I tried the codes and they did not work for my DVD/VCR/TV combo unit, but when I went to manuel setup it worked with no problem. My boys can insert the DVD them selves and play any game they want.They also like that the esipodes (spongebob) are the cartoons that they have seen before, and that if they dont want to do an activity or it is too difficult for them that they can just hit the skip key and contuine watching the show.This is a great item and a great way to enjoy time with your kids and have them learn something while they enjoy alloted TV time."
1,Which DVD Player did others get to work with this?,We purchased this game for our son for christmas last year 2004. He hasn't been able to use it because it will not work on the three different dvd players we own. We were able to get the controller to work on our RCA during the programming stage but then the dvd player would not recognize the A button on the test card for the controller. We have tried ALL the different codes that Fisher Price has put out on their website for all three dvd players we own and none of them work. I would LOVE to know what brand and model that the people who got theirs to work own....Can anyone helps us?
4,ENTERAINING and EDUCATIONAL!!!,"This system is great. I understand the frustration of other reviewers, but I had no problem using this on our $60.00 Philips DVD player. My sister has a cheaper dvd system that it will not work on. She called Fisher Price and they offered to take the system back and refund $$. So if you are having problems, call the 1-800 and get some assistance! All the children ages 2.5 and up that play InteracTV at my home love this system. My only complaint is it shuts off every so often when a wrong answer is pushed, but my engineer husband says thats just a programing issue because the controller is based on a tv remote. This annoys my little ones, but they get over it. Even with that one problem, I would definately BUY THIS again!!"
1,BORING BORING BORING,"WE purchased this toy for our daughter's 3 year old birthday. The night before, we decided to set it up. First of all, the set up for us did not follow the instructions AT ALL. AFter an hour of trying to figure out why our set up procedures didn't match the booklet, we finally got it to work. It was really really boring. You have to watch more than you have to interact........and watch and watch and watch before you get asked a very simple question. NOt enough interaction. ADditionally, the material was boring as well....our daughter knew all the material already and we didn't find that it was any more educational than sitting a kid down in front of Noggin or PBS! THe interaction level is VERY low. WE opted for tons of art supplies instead and the traditional scissors, paper, glue, and tons of colors and interesting items to glue onto the papres have served far better than this!"
2,DOESN'T WORK with today's TV setups,"Don't waste your time and child's hopes on this one. Overall the system seemed like a great idea, so I bought it. Received it today, and it WILL NOT WORK at ALL with all 3 of my tv setups. The dvd players are compatable, the problem is the location of the players. I have them on top of my television, I have a widescreen, and in my room and daughters room they are on a shelf above the TV. If you do not have a dvd player DIRECTLY in FRONT of where your child will be sitting, dvd at lap level FORGET IT, it WILL NOT WORK. Major dissapointment and flaw with this system. Returning to Amazon today, and getting the Vsmile instead, at least it has cords and will work wherever."
1,Just Plain Does Not Work,Tried 3 different DVD players- Did not work at all.It is a shame because I love the idea of this toy. I should have listened to the reviews.
1,Very disappointed!!!!,"I recently bought this toy for my son for his birthday, we were very excited until we got it home and realized that you need to try so many codes on the DVD to finally get it to work. Then we finally got it programmed, only for it to work for about 5 min then short out. After two trips 30 miles to Toys R Us, I find out from their very rude employees(managers too)that I am stuck with the toy because they can only exchange for another one of the same toy. Contacting Fisher-Price was not any help either they just referred me back to the store."
1,Why did I bother??!!!!,"My mother bought this system for my 3 year old son for Christmas. I have an Apex DVD Player and it took a while to get it programmed, but after that it worked great for a short time. Unfortunately my son loved the game so much that he was nearly devastated when one day it just stopped working. I changed the batteries, tried re-programming it, but nothing worked. He just played with the system at a friends house the other day and after seeing his delight, I purchased another system to give it another try - no luck. I can't even get the darn thing to program and now I will have to return a second one!!! By the way, there were only 2 in the store when I repurchased it last week and both appear to have been returned. Maybe they should work out the kinks before using paying customers as test dummies and further frustrating our children at an age that is already frustrating enough!!!"
1,PIECE OF CRAP,"We got this for my now 3 year old for this past christmas. I was very excited about it, but when i tried to set it up on our RCA DVD player, it didnt work. I tried the codes and I tried the manual method, but it just didnt work. I assumed it was because my DVD player is one of those all-in-one things, that's also a VCR and radio, etc.So, I put the toy to the side until this March, when, for my daughter's birthday, we got her a Disney Princess DVD player and Television. I was all hyped up again, and AGAIN, neither the codes nor the manual setup worked, and now its just a piece of crap lying around her room.VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!!"
1,RUINED CHRISTMAS,We bought this for our 3 year old and tried all day christmas to get it to work. We tried 3 different dvd players and none worked with it. We finally returned it today and will have to wait a week or two to buy something else to replace it. Don't waste your money and break a childs heart by buying this item.
4,A Hindu writer's journeys to the Islamic lands,"This book written by the Trinidad born and Cambridge educated Naipaul is a outsiders view on Muslims. The book begins with the authors interaction with Muslims in Trinidad itself, where the Muslims of Indian sub-continent origin have an uneasy relationship with the majority Hindus, who are also from the Sub-Continent. Then it moves on to Muslim majority lands from Egypt to Malaysia where the author mingles with the locals and tries to understand their morals, ethics and livestyles The author being a non-muslim however could'nt visit to the Islamic holy lands of Mecca and Medina thereby leaving a big gap in truly understanding the Muslim Psyche. Maybe Naipaul's recent marriage to a Muslim Pakistani novelist will help him in gaining entry to these cities."
2,"Not ""an Islamic journey""","When I first read this book, I enjoyed it. I was bothered, however, by Naipaul's peevish tone. After reading many other things by Naipaul I returned to this book. What I thought was simple peevishness, it seems clear to me now, is mean-spiritedness. And it is directed quite often toward Muslim people - not just fanatic Muslims, all Muslims."
5,read this and understand Islam,It helps that the author is not christian. Prepared to be depressed. You will have a better understanding than our president!!
1,Really small,"I order this thinking it was the same size as a large Balzac Balloon Ball that I had seen at a party recently. What I received is a very small ball, about the size of a cantaloupe. The picture really should show a person holding the ball so that the size is apparent."
5,Reviving our Sexual Desire!,"Highly recommend the Duet video set, for enhancing - or in our case reviving - your sexual desire!This is an educational DVD, with an emphasis on what the producers refer to as the Deliberate Orgasm technique - they call it D.O.ing. My partner and I got a lot out of watching these DVDs, as we had gotten to a place in our relationship we were no longer much interested in sex.This video set discusses the sexual cycle of what they call tumescence, which brought a whole other element of excitement to both of us in the bedroom. The method of the man DOing the woman is clearly shown, with consistent lecture throughout the demonstration. There is an ease now for my partner to navigate his way around my clitoris. He has found my ""spot"" and is learning to ""peak"" me to give me longer orgasms. He takes the lead now in bed, and enjoys everything he is doing to my body. Our sex life is so much more fun, and has gone beyond the point either of us thought possible before."
1,disappointed,"I agree with D. Thayn's comment that those positive reviews are probably planted by the Welcomed Consensus. It's over rated.For one, the quality of the DVDs are very poor. Bad sound quality. Video isn't any better. They probably copied from the last copy of VHS.Lesson learnt - get the new production stuff, not the recycled archive."
4,Miramar Nature Videos,"I love the entire nature series by Miramar ie Natural States, Grand Canyon, Water Colors, The Minds Eye, etc. I plan on slowly upgrading my entire collection ( 10 in all ) to DVD."
5,That's them......that's perfection!!!!!!,"There isnt a bigger compliment i can pay other than to say it was a damn shame these 2 cats didnt get what their talent clearly deserves.......multi platinum status+globel recognition.From start to finish this is nothing short of a masterpiece. The beats and rhymes at a level most artists in hiphop today or previous will never reach. The 2 mc's flows are fast, witty, honest, hard edged, skilled and basically perfect. The beats are absolutely rockin'. The dj (KAOS) is off the meat-rack, his cuts and slices are awesome, and they bless EVERY track. Its basically ""2 turntables and a microphone"" time baby!!!! All the tracks are excellent but my stand out joints are ""art of facts"", ""31 bumrush"", ""to ya chest"", ""the ultimate"", ""its gettin'hot"", ""the interview"", ""this is the way"", ""who's this?"" and the showbiz remix of ""the ultimate"" at the end. Off the hook."
4,ABOUT THE SAME AS THE FIRST ONE,"for me, this has about the same feel as the first one. i hate that they broke up though. i would've liked to see what they would've done as time progressed in hip hop. i agree with one of the viewers though when the person said it is hip hop as it should be. as i said before, the beats could be fatter."
3,It works okay,It works okay. I don't know if it's worth the price to be honest. Some people say it saved their sweaters. It removed some of the pelling from one of my sweaters but not all of it. You really have to work it over the same spots over and over again and press hard. P.S. It does not work on cotton shirts. It did not remove the pelling from one of my cotton blouses. It did work okay on the sweater.
2,Datd,"The book is dated, and written very much from the british point of view. As the other reviewer notes the book makes moral judgements as to the participants with no basis to support, other than preconceptions."
2,don't bother,"Like many books of this type there is not nearly enough information provided to actually get your own code working. This is essentially a lame reprint of journal articles.All the same mistakes, lack of information and general lack of usefulness that you find in any typical journal article you'll find in here.I've got mixed feelings about writing this negative review, because I'd really like to unload this worthless book."
2,Below Expectations,The premise of the story was good. But I found the writing to leave a lot to be desired. Very Mills and Boon!!
3,REALLY GOOD.,"This happens to be one of the first DS i have read. The suspense in the book captured me thoroughly. I just could not put down my book. As most of DS books this one has romance, mystery, suspense and all other stuff which a book should have. If you still haven't got it....well what are you waiting for. GO GET IT."
5,AWESOME IMAGERY!,"This book as well as others by Danielle Steel are wonderful... Danielle has a wonderful gift... When she writes a story she writes it in such a way that you can see, feel, cry and laugh with the characters in the book because they are so real.. Danielle Steele is without a doubt my absolute favorite writer of all time.... Keep going I love your books..."
4,Accident,II enjoyed Accident by Danielle Steel it was an enjoyable read as most of her books hve a very good story line
3,"Good, but NOT enough songs!","O.K., I think Bad Boy sorta rushed a little bit on this album! There's too many Interludes(skits) And not enough songs! They could've at least waited two or three more years to come out with a greatest hits album. I think the album should've had enough songs to make two CD's."
2,Mixed review from Loyal Kathy Smith customer,"Very disappointed in this C-D. This comes from a VERY loyal kathysmith customer. I have lost 53 pounds thanks to all of her previouswalking tapes. This C-D has NO WARM UP OR COOL DOWN and no motivationaltalking during it. I had really looked forward to a new C-D from kathywith all of the above, and this has none of it.However I did take it to the gym and used the flip side to work-out on the eliptical machine. It worked. However, then I started taking my oldKathy Smith C-D's and they were just as good if not better.Sorry Kathy..... I'm still waiting for a new C-D. This doesn't cut it!"
3,Some Angels have 4 paws,"I love the book, but was disappointed that it came without the book cover. I think they should have given that information."
2,Not much help,"I was expecting a lot more information, this book is too generic and vague, besides, who uses a Camcorder anymore?"
5,From Babylon to Timbuktu: A History of the Ancient Black Races Including the Black Hebrews,"I LOVE THIS BOOK. IT IS A GREAT HISTORICAL TIMELINE. MOST PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS BOOK, BUT IF YOU CAN PUT IT WITH HISTORY OF THE 1900S AND THE HISTORY OF THE AMERICAS IT COME ALL TOGETHER AND TRUTH WILL BEGAIN TO KNOCK AT YOUR DOOR. THIS BOOK IS JUST A SMALL PART OF A BIGGER TRUTH."
2,Creaters of Babylon,"I have read this book and it was okay, I believe the author needed more research on the nationality of Hebrew people and who they are. Black people are the original Hebrew people only they don't know that they are we have been brain washed to believe that we are just African. The book does explain how many Africans came to the land of African, they were from Israel, however they were invaded by Arabs and many of them fled to North African and this is how some of the population began in African. Many Africans there are not really African, they are Hebrew Israelites. The book was infromative, however the author kept interchanging the word Hebrew and Jew in a time the letter J was not even in excistance. The letter J was discovered in the late 1600's and the author is talking about information way before that time so how is he referrering to Jews. Some parts of the book is informative and some repetitive. Please do further study of this subject matter."
3,Nice and Simple,"Finder's Keepers is a ""nice and simple"" love story. Pretty predictable but nice characters with a nice story to tell. It is not a page turner but something you can pick up and read and then come back too - nice Sunday read."
4,Color World War 2,"Actual World War 2 coverage in Germany during Hitlers rain. Most of the film at this time was in Black and White, this is the start of Color film. A must see if YOUR into WW2."
4,Hitlet's True Colors,"For a documentary of Hitler, this dvd is top notch. To see the history in color brings the entire Third Reich to a level that makes it real compared to black and white footage."
1,Footage can be seen on youtube. PROPOGANDA FILLED,Can view all of this on youtube just search Hitler in Color or WW2 German Footage in color. Few scenes I hadnt already seened and alot of it was not of Hitler but mostly random talking about what an Evil man he was rather than give any decent info. Waste of money. EXTREMELY short and SHORT clips
3,Not Punk. At all.,"This cd is just not punk. Period. Not at all. It's emo/screamo at best, but some songs lean closer to pop. That being said, there are some decent bands on here: The Matches, From First To Last, Bad Religion, Dropkick Murphys, and The Unseen are the only bands that semi-save this cd.The one thing I just can't figure out is how ANYONE can call Sage Francis's song ""Sun vs. Moon"" punk??? It's 100% rap, and bad rap at that. And Youth Group's ""Shadowland"" is about as punk as Jessica Simpson. All in all, this cd just isn't what it claims to be, and sets punk way back."
5,Punkorama 10,"Now, this is awesome! I'm not such a fan of the other volumes but I was listening to this one a few days ago with some friends and I instantly liked it. It's got real punk bands, not some of the stuff that they label punk just cause it says 'the government sucks, I hate my parents, Rich people suck'. Definetly buy this or aleast put it on your Wish List!"
1,Boring,This book is one of the most boring books I have ever read. It just doesn't move fast enough and nothing happens. All these children do is move back and forth from one underground part of the castle to another. We need a little action here.
4,This book is definitely worth reading,Dr. Pickering does a good job of explaining how your body works and its relationship to high blood pressure. He does a great job of interpreting conflicting studies. The only thing that kept me from giving him a five star rating is his negative reaction to alternative treatments.
2,Broke in record time,"I'm not sure if I received a defective product, but when initially setting up the new security code, the part you turn to set the combo jammed and broke. I was rather irritated, as the lock box didn't hold up for even one use. Disappointed, I sent the lock box back for a refund and ordered the Master Lock.The box did not come with any instructions, however the Shurlock website has a video tutorial on how to set up the lock."
3,Numbers hard to see,"Product works as intended but because the numbers are hard to see (even in daylight) I have not used it on a regular basis and still ""hide"" a key. Also, because the door that slides up to give key access is on the right and the door jam is left of the knob (where it hangs from) the key will not come out and entry is too small to allow finger to get it. I've had to attach a string and leave it hanging out to be able to get the key. Maybe it should have a right or left option for the door that hides the key.Addendum on 8/27/11- more thought should be given to design to allow it to be more user friendly. Product was rarely used, sits collecting dust... I'm still 'hiding' a key as prior to this purchase."
1,"Bad, bad, bad",I will never get those two hours back...this was terrible and had so much potential to be good given the plot and actors.
5,Great movie,"I watched the original Alien movie on it's release day way back in 1979. I have been an Alien fan since. And, personally, I think this movie was fantastic."
2,Fantastic visuals....weak script,"I am sure its been said many time before, but this film is a visual feast, just don't pay attention to the script which is riddled with gaping potholes and poor character motivation.The trailer for the film is 5 stars. The film itself is an unfortunate letdown."
4,Good Movie and Good in 3D,"I watched it on my Blue Ray 3d with glasses and it was just as good as the theater version.Oh, maybe not a 500 ft screen, but you get the idea.I have a Samsung 62 Inch LED Flatscreen and with the lights off and in 3d it was great."
3,Just ok,I was expecting more but that the movie and the story line was just ok. I can't remember all of it because it didn't keep my attention.
2,not worth it,Worst use of 3D of any movie I've seen. Terrible script. Not worth the money. This movie was shot using all 3D rigs. Did not read the reviews beforehand. Expected much more from the maker of so many other good films. 'Blade Runner'...
3,"Epic, almost","You know how some movies SHOULD be awesome? You want them to be, you're rooting for them to be good / get better as you're watching ... sometimes they just don't. That's what happens here. It coulda been great. Really. But something about it (pacing? dialogue vapidity? character blandness?) just falls ... short. Sure, the end has a nice 'surprise,' but I can't say it's worth the effort to get there. Google the end instead and watch something else."
3,Prometheus was Disappointing,"I was expecting so much more from this movie. The story line could have gone very deep, and the character of the advanced ""engineer"" could have been built up showing us more about our DNA ancestry."
3,meah,For all of the hype it was not as good as it could have been. The graphics were amazing the actors were good and the story was poor to say the least. The best part of this movie was watching the previews.
3,Prometheus,PrometheusMy internet conection is slow here so I had to watch it in low quality but I still enjoyed the movie. it was hard to follow in places but the overall story line was clear.
4,Compelling Movie that Leaves Much Unanswered,"The fascinating premise that mankind was DNA seeded in prehistory by a race of alien travelers begins with a grand opening of cinematography and music. As the story unfolds, these ""Engineers"" left their calling cards throughout a few early human tribes.The modern (future) discovery of these wall and cave paintings leads to an expedition to the star system and planet depicted in the drawings. Upon the discovery of remnants of these Engineers, other life forms are encountered, and any similarity to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" points to ""Prometheus"" as the prequel. While this movie lacks some of the horror-shock of the Alien series, the storyline is compelling and clever, the acting is vibrant and real and in the end, there are more questions than answers.The last scene begs for a sequel, which I understand, is in the works."
3,Visually excellent - other than that... well I'd watch it again,"The up side is that the visual effects are brilliant, the casual physics (nobody has a believable explanation for inter stellar flight) are believable.The story isn't any too bright. The characters have a worst case horror movie case of the dumbs. Faced with an unknown alien snake like creature what do we do? Well assume that it's friendly and try to pet it of course. It just goes on stupid decision after stupid decision. But in the end it's sci-fi and it's not like there is any way it could really be expected to reflect real life? But do people have to be so entirely and utterly dumb?"
3,Great special effects,"The story was ok but the special effects were beautiful. We bought the 3D blu ray version what comes with several extra discs with bonus features. Have not been able to watch those yet. Big fan of the Alien franchise. This is suppose to be kind of a like a prequel and it does explain some aspects of those other movies. However, some of the story has very smart people doing very dumb things and that is what gets frustrating with movies. Sometimes the main characters do things that you hope they would not do in real life. Oh well, it's only a movie. I can recommend it for the visuals and say don't get too upset with the story. I still don't think I understand it all and am going to have to watch it again and see the bonus features as well."
2,Couldn't even finish it,"I normally love These ""team"" themed films, like ""Alien"", ""The Abyss"", ""Jurassic Park"", etc.This was a lame movie. I paid $4 to watch it (the price of a well cocktail lol) this movie, and I lost interest at about minute 10."
1,Incompetent authoring,"This isn't a review of the film (there are a thousand of those here), but a comment on the Blu-ray. In the (apparently) raging contest to see which disk author can do the most to ruin a Blu-ray, we may have a winner. Not only does a giant white bar cover much of the screen if you pause or slow the film (and this is a film that begs you to watch the FX frame by frame), a second bar appears above that one, a guarantee that you won't be able to see anything you want to see. Although they disappear after a few seconds, they reappear with every frame advance, virtually disabling your ability to study the FX. Compare this to the Harry Potter films, for example, where NOTHING appears on the screen when you pause it, which is exactly what a competent author does with a disk. Unfortunately, this one was authored by SLIME MOLD."
2,Disappointed,Fortunately I used a credit and therefore paid about $2 to rent this movie.I was looking forward to seeing it but am sorry to say it was rather boring and seemed almost low budget. I can't believe this was directed by the same person who directed the great Alien
3,Prometheus-Not a Great Ending,"Great beginning of the movie,not to thrilled with the ending. I guess there will be a Prometheus II,judgeing from the ending. Hope it will be better than I. Loved the special effects!"
3,"Solid Prequel, however . . .","Solid Prequel, however, it just doesn't have that 'this has never been done before' panache that the original Alien did. Alien marked the first time a woman played the ballsey leading man role, a sort of female John Wayne. This movie also lacked that edge-of-your-seat suspense that Alien evoked so well. Cinematography ? A+, Casting ? Uninspiring to say the least. Watchable yes but also quite forgettable. Perhaps Ridley should have left well enough alone."
1,Wow! That was bad.,"This is not a review of the DVD. I'm sure it is quite delightful, however the movie sucked. I'll give it 1 star because of special effect. Not because they were good FX, just because they had some. (FYI - you can't give 0 stars). As other reviews have noted there isn't any science in their fiction. The tie in to the Alien movie(s) is really weak. What really bugged me was when the girl that did a caesarian to extract the alien and then hops off the table and runs down the hall. I took my wife 24 hours before she could stand up."
4,Enjoyable!,"Wow, was really looking forward to this Ridley Scott pre-qual and although it wasnt as good as I hoped, I still enjoyed it! Great sci-fi movie I've seen in a long time! I had to dig deeper to find that Ridley Scott originally requested Fox budget his movie at 230 million but they declined and only set his budget at 130 million. Fox didnt think the film would do as well as Scott envisioned and would explain why the movie wasnt as good as it should have been releasing Scott of any fault and shifting the blame on FOX! Now Fox is supposedly going to front more money to budget the next Prometheus seeing how well the first one did!"
3,Prometheus,It wasn't bad. It could have been more exciting with a better plot. The movie dragged at some points and had some muffled dialog.
4,Perdy Good,The movie was ok. Left the backdoor open. The writer should have consulted with me before releasing the film. I would have brought more depth to the story. Overall just nice to see a new sci-fi movie.
1,Prometheus,there must of been some disruption during the download after purchasing. Never got a chance to view on flight or rate.
4,prometheus,this is over all a four star movie as good entertainement but for the science or physics or reality is not true to fact . first in seventy five year world will not be traveling in space like this movie say more like five hundred years from now . and why is the bad the blondes now in movies . while the darkys are the heros oh i see more darky in usa now .
5,excellent,"I saw this movie on hd but definetly the blu-ray is the best...the picture and the quality are superb, great"
3,Interesting,"Interesting plot, better than I expected. I've seen better sci fi, but I did enjoy it. Liked the actors and effects"
1,stinker,"They should have stopped with Alien. I kept waiting for the story to gel, nothing interesting or cohesive happened. It is a waste of time."
2,Prometheus,"This is a terrible movie, the ""plot"" is all over the place, the characters have no reason for their actions. The special effects are decent, especially at the start, but save your money for a real movie."
3,Okay,This movie was okay for being entertained. I may have to watch it again to see if I may have missed something that I didn't pick up on the first time. I thought the computer generated scenes were very good.
2,Save your money,No big deal. Similar to Aliens but not nearly as good. I felt that the movie was trying to relive the glory of earlier successes. Nothing unique here.
5,Great movie,"I got the item I wanted in a timely fashion, that's all I ask for.So often thing are miss listed or labeled, but these were right."
1,A poor restart to the Alien series,"From what Ridley Scott said, this was a movie to stand apart from the Alien series. It wasn't. It was simply a poor (very poor) restart with good effects and a weak plot. I like Ridley Scott's other movies (Alien, Blade Runner), but this was just sad. The beginning excited me and the original premise behind it was great, but it never came together.It was a waste of the $2 rental. Save your money and your time - watch soething else."
2,Religious beliefs & sci-fi?,"Don't see why aliens was attatched to this movie to explain in how it started. Effects were good but never the less, it was not impressive. Great thing this was a rental."
2,Long and weak,It failed to meet with the hype. It was entertaining but lacked any real depth or weight that had been pitched with it's release. Essentially a 2 hour time suck.
5,Wow,Big Alien franchise fan and this movie does an amazing job of telling us how the story begins before Alien.
2,I Watched It 3 Times in Theaters,"...and I've concluded it to be, after very much wanting it to be a classic, a severely flawed film. Every aspect from the creature design to the dialogue was under par and should have been sharpened and scrutinized just a bit more for the dynasty's sake. Yes, The Alien series is a dynasty built on Scott's original vision that deserves respect. Still, this film raises many interesting questions and the visuals are excellent. If only the rest could have fallen into place."
2,Dumb Plot,"I agree that the film looks good, but plot doesn't make much since, aliens seed earth then for no explicable reason aliens want to destroy us. Then we have the overused plot angle of searching for God and finding our alien fathers. I have been a fan of righteous Science Fiction since a teenager, but it buggers the mind to see great Sci-Fi writers of past ignored who had intelligent and entertaining plots for the same old tiresome mundane stories that Hollywood comes up with. Coulda, shoulda, woulda, but, alas, same old same old. What Hollywood cannot do is anything worth a good two to three hours of my time to watch. Oh, please give me another Batman movie, or some other lame comic book super hero Bull! Never ceases to amaze me what little the world expects from movie producers.As a great Sci-Fi writer once said, ""99% of it all is crap""."
2,I want my two hours back.,"Take a failing franchise, rife with amazing backstory, and fan enthusiasm. Put it in a pot and take a huge dump on it."
1,This movie is awful,"Go to IMDB for good user reviews of this movie. Here is the summary:Good: Special EffectsBad: Storyline, character development (none), character likability (none, and for being scientists, really, really dumb), premise, motivation, dialogue.I was really disappointed in this movie. Even if the plot was awful, at least have good action or tense moments...but it didn't have them either. Two evolved, opposable digits down."
1,too much violence,"I was really looking forward to this movie and so when I watched it, I was so disappointed because it was so violent I could only watch half. Bummer."
5,Awesome,"Prometheus is a movie that makes you think, yes a lot of questions are left in the movie but that's for the sequel to answer."
2,Disappointing.,"Very disappointed with the story - had great potential. Cinematography was great but subplots were confusing. In the end, I wanted the main character to die."
3,Save your money!,"OMG! Where do I begin? I suppose my first mistake was to have high expectations, after all, it is Ridley Scott. But bad scripting, juvenile storyline (complete with an evil industrialist), and inexcusably bad science make this a movie to miss. Sorry Noomi, I loved you in the Swedish version of Girl with a Dragon Tatoo but you were just mis-cast in this role and certainly no Sigourney Weaver. This movie felt like a money grab. Come on Scotts, you are capable of so much better."
3,"Good movie in general, bad Alien movie.","If this is considered an Alien movie, it might be worse than previous cellar dweller Resurrection (not including AVP and AVP2, those are completely out of my ranking).If this is not considered an Alien move, its a pretty decent flick!"
1,Poor ripoff of Alien,"No logic what-so-ever. Waste of time. I suggest you watch Alien again. The very end was the best part, but I wish that I hadn't kept watching it that long."
5,DONT BELIEVE ALL THE HATERS IN HERE THE MOVIE IS GREAT,"PLEASE DONT TAKE ADVICE FROM PEOPLE THAT MOST LIKELY HAVE NOT SEEN ALIEN , THERE IS GOING TO BE A PART TWO , I RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE FOR ALL THE TRUE REAL ALIEN FANS ! NOT THE ONES THAT WATCH ALIEN VS PREDATOR IDIOTS ,THE REAL AND I MEAN REAL ALIEN MOVIES."
2,Pretty bad,I just watched this a few days ago. There are plenty of reviews giving you all the details on why this is so bad. I will add just a little bit.This movie is neither original nor rational. The crew act without the least bit of common sense or reason. You figure on this kind of mission they would have some procedures. Not this gang who stumble along from one disastrous mistake to next. Maybe they should have watched Andromeda Strain before heading out. It might have taught them a bit about how to go about examining alien life forms. It has all the dumb things I have come to expect of big budget. There is special effect; people with attitude; the required chase; plenty of gore and of course the naked lady running in distress. In other words it is a very typical Hollywood movie.On the plus side it is not the absolute worst movie I have seen. Thanks to the non stop stream of garbage being produced it misses that. Therefore it gets a 2 and not a 1.
2,NOT MY MOVIE,"STORY IS NOT MY FLAVOR AND IT DID NOT KEEP MY ATTENTION AT ALL, I WOULD NOT PUSH THIS ON ANYONE"
4,Big bucks gets you a big movie that's pretty good.,"Prometheus is a large budget SiFi movie that shows its spending. The sets and effects are excellent and there is even a coherent plot that starts out about the origin of man and morphs into an 'Alien' prequel. Now this is not a bad thing and asside from a several logic flaws, the movie has a good mix of character development and action sequences. And they do a very good job alighning with the original 'Alien' flick of years ago, at least as far as my memory goes. Overall, a good effort and a keeper if you are a collector of SiFi flicks."
5,Powerfuly Portrayed image of Mankinds Drive to better itself,"A Wonderfully Idealistic image of two distinct possabuilties, explored from the deapths and hights of the psychy, Not for the faint of heart as any extream explorer can tell you, Be prepared for any and just about all possabuilities,,"
1,3D DID NOT WORK ON MY FIRST PURCHASE; HAD TO REORDER!,"The bluray film is fine, but the 3D version had only a green or blue hue, no color at all, and lots of bursts of hash. My disappointment was not attempting to play the 3D until now, end of November, when it is too late to return the item, so I purchased it again from Amazon and will definitely play the 3D right away! My equipment: one Oppo 3D, one Panasonic 3D, a new Panasonic 48-inch 3D TV in my bedroom. The basement has a full blown movie theater with big cinepro amps, etc. Great movie on bluray except he left out how the space jockey gets back into his chair as we saw him in Alien."
2,Predictable,"""Prometheus"" starts out being quite interesting and absorbing with the visual effects. Unfortunately as others have already stated, the story degenerates into a replication of the original ""Alien"" movie with Sigourney Weaver. If you like Science Fiction movies for their special effects, you won't be disappointed. Even so, I was let down by the repetition of the classic ""Alien"" plot."
3,"Interesting, but also not awesome","I'm a huge Ridley Scott fan and so was really looking forward to this movie. There are some really interesting things that he's done and touched on in this movie. A familiarity with the Alien films, particularly ""Alien"" and ""Aliens"" is really necessary to catch all the ways in which you can see Scott is playing with subject matter for which there is already a lot of canon, but a fair bit of it he doesn't agree with, maybe. There are some great gems in the subtexts created by backgrounds of the characters, the android's choice of on whom to model himself, etc.On the other hand, a lot of the movie is messy as heck. There is tons of exposition and just a lot of general ponderousness. This is not a great film."
4,Promethus,"I was surprised about this movie I did not expect the action and it was a really good movie. I thought this would be more like a diseny movie, but it was great."
2,ehhhh,"It wasn't that good. I expected a lot more than i got. Kind of boring and suspense that led to nothing. Pretty much made a new alien movie, but a bad one."
4,Pretty well constructed,"I found the general concept of Prometheus tenable although a bit disjointed at times. The flow was interesting with minor sub-plots providing a nice change throughout the film. Did the movie answer all of my basic questions, no, but enough to make this a very enjoyable sci-fi flick."
3,not really worth the money,The movie wasn't as good as I expected. Watched in 3d and it was ok. not much color or good 3d effects.
2,Prometheus Review,This movie is truly awful. The story goes and acting is questionable. On the other hand it is a visual and the 3D is done well. Watch this movie with sound off.
3,Good Movie,This is an entertaining enough movie. If you liked the other Alien movies then you will enjoy this movie also.
4,Interesting,"I liked it, and It was worth watching. Special effects were very good, and I liked the story line too. A little deep, but not too much."
4,Great visuals kinda bad script,Thought the movie did a good job with showing off a new world. The script however... was not to impressive. Also this movie has one of the craziest scenes I have ever witnessed.
2,Transparent Plot,"In this prequel to Alien, Ridley Scott showed very little imagination, and poorly utilized the actors. He even messed up a number of continuity items from scene to scene and between this movie and Alien. The only reason I gave this movie 2 stars instead of 1 is that the visual effects were done well.To anyone who really liked Alien (one of my all-time favorites), skip Prometheus."
3,Poor quality streaming,"About 2/3 of the way thru, the streaming became very slow and it would stop and back up every few minutes......very frustrating!"
3,Decent,"An okay sci-fi thriller. I would rate this about 3 stars actually. Worth watching, but only one to own if you get it for a bargain price."
4,Excellent film,"I saw this film in theaters and thought it was ok but when I saw that it was available to buy almost a month before DVD release I bought it. I think this is one of those movies that you like better the second time you watch it is beautifully shot and directed, I am hoping for a sequel to the Prometius story besides that in the Alien Trilogy"
4,Great Sci Fi,One of the best sci Fi movies in a long time! All characters were great and can't wait for sequel as long as Ridley Scott directs 1
1,What an Awful Mess of a Movie,"Stupid plot. Ridiculous screenplay. Murky cinematography. And some of the worst acting I've ever seen. Noomi Papace is a very, very unattractive and untalented actress. Charlize Theron was pathetic. It's rare for me to say I really hated a film, but I really hated this one."
2,"Have to agree with other reviews, plot sucked","***Spoiler in my review****I really wanted this movie to be better than other reviewers said it was, but sadly it fell short. Spectacular effects (as far as the main 'alien' character-though short screen time), but stupid things the characters do that you expect more from. Seemed more like the film was made for Sy-Fy channel viewing with some of the acting, and the plot was so boring and over done. I thought it might give some interesting perspective into origins of life, but that stale story of 'alien race bent on killing mankind' is kinda what we're left with. The additional Giger/Alien characters made me roll my eyes, and though I watched it to the end, I can't say it saved itself anywhere in the movie. Look elsewhere for interesting insight to creation, how about youtube for starters. Cause you won't find much here in Prometheus."
1,Very Terrible,The acting was terrible and so was bad & so was the story. Charlize Therson even worse and I think she's a good actor. Rip off of aliens.
3,Sci-fi,Very computer effects I think I've seen this plot before but I was to busy watching the effects impressive its ok.
3,Needs more viewing to piece the idea together....,"Don't want to give to much info that might spoil the movie. But if you have not seen ""Alien"" you might want to after watching this. And if you have seen ""Alien"", you might wish you hadn't seen this? For me it was a rather weak connection. The woman who comes up with the major questions in the search; well I felt she, as a lot of archeologist, was way off base. Mainly from the opening scene, then reflecting that on the over all way the movie ends."
3,It's ok.,"Visually appealing although when you really think about the philosophy of it, it's really depressing. Plus there's some rather cryptic scenes. All in all it's just a ""meh""."
2,Strong start weak ending,The movie started out well with an original story line but seem to loose steam and origanility by morfing into simular scenes of Alien where the ailen being captures and uses the body of another as a host or birth chamber. You end up feeling like you've been there seen that.
1,A nihilistic film that flirts with substance,"This film attempts to address big questions of origin and creation, there are moments when it approaches meaning but ultimately this film takes you on a ride only to leave you at a dead end street.It is a nihilistic film."
5,Prometheus,This is a awesome movie. the special effects were great and the actors were great. ridley scott did a great job directed this movie. the aliens in this movie were pretty cool. is this the prelude to aliens? mabey or mabey not who knows. all in all this is a great movie. i hope they do a sequel because they left it open for another one. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do
3,It's okay,This was a decent show. I liked the special effects but the thin characters did not excite me enough to want them to survive the ordeal. Not sure how this ends up being a prequel to Alien.
2,Much ado about next to nothing,If you're a fan of the films of which this is a cash in on better movies prequel go for it if you need it that badly.
3,Great potential but falls apart on ridiculous cliche plot moves,"Seriously, who is the head of HR for this expedition? This is the best lot of scientists from around the world that they can muster? Let's see, the rock guy is clearly a hothead with a fierce attitude and temper. Then there is the dorkey naive guy who wants to play with the gooey stuff and with the creatures. Wouldn't they have figured out ahead of time to be wary? Isn't skepticism a primary rule of a good scientist? The captain of the ship come on to and sleeps with the bosses daughter. These morons set themselves up for defeat. So many classic movie cliches are played - ie they get split up, communications break down- that the overarching themes which could have been dug deep are lost cause the audience is frustrated at the foolish antics of the characters. Woulda, Coulda, Shoulda. Too bad a blown opportunity at an intriguing concept."
2,not worth watching.,i like sci fi movies. but this movie isn't worth watching. It was 2 hrs of my life i won't get back.
3,It's ok,"Definitely not Aliens or Aliens2, but worthwhile watching as a prelude. 9 more words, 9 more words, 9 more words."
3,Come on Scott,I just saw the film about 3 hours ago. I was some what disapointed in the film. It started off slow and then about the last 30 minutes it was good. I expected so much more from this long awaited film. If you liked alien 3 then you will love this.What I mean is >>>>>>>>>Boring>>>>>>>!!!!!
3,Prequel or Sequel??,"Well worth seeing and I would have rated this film as a 4-star except for the fact that It doesn't inform the viewer that it is related to the ""Alien"" series until well into the film. So I thought it was copying ""Alien(s)"" and I resented it for that until well into the film.Once I realized that it was a prequel or sequel of the ""Alien"" series, I enjoyed it immensly. Now I'll be watching for the ""Prometheus"" sequel(s)with great anticipation!!"
3,underwhelming,"The stars go to high production value and stunning visuals. The storyline just seemed like more of the same...group of rag tag scientists, technicians venture into deep space on what they think is a scientific expedition, but the calculating corporate executive and duplicitous android have other ideas. Sound familiar? As much as I liked Noomi Rapace in the Millenium Trilogy, she seemed miscast for this role. Or maybe the role itself was just not written well. The humanoid alien was kind of interesting and from a technical standpoint done well, but all I could think of was Dr. Manhattan from the Watchmen."
1,didnt like it,"went and saw it in theaters and it was one long boring let down.previews looked awesome only good parts in the movie were the previews,"
1,Senseless and grotesque,"Begins on an interesting premise, but takes a downward spiral into gratuitous wierdness thereafter. Question: How does an alien octopus baby, mixed with a humanoid alien make a toothy hammerhead shark alien? And what does that have to do with anything else in the movie? The budget for this film would have been better spent on a credible charity. Don't mucky up your mind with it."
3,Not Up to Standard,"I was disappointed. IMO, the script and the casting were weak at best. The storyline presented an opportunity, but Ridley Scott just didn't make the leap. I actually watched it twice just to make sure I didn't miss something. I didn't. Special Effects were good, but not great. This movie didn't come close to the the first two - ""Alien"" & ""Aliens"". I think if you are a follower of Mr. Scott's earlier movies you'll likely be very disappointed. If I could give it 2.5 stars I would. I wouldn't recommend it - I rather watch ""Aliens"" again for the 20th time."
2,Poor casting,"Actors were mis-cast in practically every role. The movie does bring forward challenging questions, but most plot elements are too unclear to follow, let alone understand."
2,"The journey is no fun, without a distination!","The is a popular quote, ""The Journey is the Destination"". I'm sure whoever said that, didn't find themselves in a torture chamber at the end of the journey! That's exactly what this movie is all about, it draws you in with a fair amount of unknowns, and slowly reveals a few things, and then reveals absolutely nothing about the plot of the movie itself. In the end, this movie finds itself back at the beginning. If you like chasing rainbows, this movie is for you, because there is absolutely no pot of gold, or end of the rainbow here, just some pretty eye candy and special effects with a very thin story."
3,Its just a movie guys,It's a movie that help those of us from the 2010 movie series era see how it all begin. The ending is lacking but for a good movie just to watch with low expectation.
5,Stellar!!,This movie has been getting ripped apart by people with their hopes just way too high. I feel this is a prequel film to the Alien series yes but come on people your just being way too judgmental. Anyway that's what I wanted to say off the bat this movie is fantastic great cast very good storyline (yes it's not perfect but and it has it's plot holes) but it fits the Alien theme well and has great potential to relaunch the series which was kinda faltering on it's own anyway. Any real sci-fi fan should check this movie out it's worth it!
4,Awesome special effects,"The movie is a little far fetched about being able to travel to an alien world millions of miles away within a persons life time. Once you can get over that fact, the discovery process that the humans make to find the aliens and the predators is very exciting. The visual effects are awesome and Ridley Scott leaves everyone with a cliff hanger. If you have enjoyed the previous aliens movies this is definitely one to see."
3,"A pretty, disjointed, disappointment.","So this is what a couple hundred million dollars can buy you in special effects these days. I generously rate this collage a 3 for the beautiful imagery and moody score.Only die-hard Alien fans, who have longed for an origin story, need apply. Scott barely tickles their fancy with a feather.For the rest of us, Prometheus is a mish-mosh of a missed opportunity.I don't mean the trivialization of human existence to being a botched experiment by the ""engineers"". Or their witty idea of eliminating said experiment by creating a bio-weapon, that backfires on them.I'm referring to the major whiff by Mr. Scott. The bonafide sci-fi Pinocchio story that was lost in this over-cooked soup. The android was birthed before our eyes, and snatched away, with a dreaded tease of resurrection by sequel.Hopefully that sequel will represent a rich attention to character, and set design."
1,ummmm....did not like this movie :(,"Let me start with the only good thing about this movie.......the special effects. And that's where it ends. I honestly hated this movie! I was so looking forward to getting it, found it in the mail today and had to sit down right then and watch it...... ummmmm,I feel like I just wasted time that could have been better spent, cleaning my house or something. Not only did I hate it, so did my daughters. Oh well, such is life...."
2,Great Special Effects But Story Line Not Original,"This is like a prequel to ALIEN. Even though ALIEN is 33 years older, it is more insightful possibly because of the excellent character development. I did NOT see Prometheus (2012) in the THEATER because if I had, I would NOT have bought it!"
3,"Visually impressive, modest plot","Visually very beautiful and well done. Consistent as a prequel, however story somewhat confusing and not very clear. Definitively worth seeing."
3,A little confusing,"My daughter wanted me to watch this with her. She loves the Alien movies and recommended this. I can't say I was too impressed with it. It was a little hard to know what was going on sometimes, because it wasn't addressed. The only scene that really got to me was when the woman removed the alien from her womb. That was pretty intense and she was pretty tough! In conclusion, I could have gone without seeing it and never missed out."
3,The New Noomi,"Noomi Rapace does a great job in her trilogy of the ""Hornets Nest"" This role is not strong enough for her talents. She is a great heroine and I would like her to have more opportunities to display her gifts. The super computer geek suits her."
5,Love it!,I'm a big predator and alien fan and enjoy every movie that comes out. I am looking forward the next movies!
3,not the best movie in the franchise,"Alien or aliens were both better, but this one was WAY better then aliens 3 & 4, or any of the AvP movies ever were."
4,movie,Good sifi. Both husband and I joined and got lost in the movie. Not lost lost but lost in the moments.
2,Disappointed,"This movie was just okay. Some good CGI effects, but got boring fast. Barely made it to the end. Had high hopes."
2,Poor plot . Entertaining for first half of movie then collapses,"Science fiction calls for audience to ""suspend its disbelief"" We know going in that what we are about to see is fiction and impossible. But for fun we suspend our disbelief so we can get on with the story. But about halfway into this flick that threshold collapses and we can no longer enjoy the story because it becomes childishly unbelievable. And even if we extend our license to the director to ""go ahead, make us believe,"" it was impossible to avoid giggling while the movie's climax rolled: a woman chasing the baddie while holding her abdomen together with her fingers after she has undergone emergency life-saving surgery conducted by a computerized robot. I don't want to spoil the suspense but my advice is wait for the cable version. We had very high hopes considering this movie's pedigree. But other than a terrific first few minutes, this one is disappointing."
4,"Good movie, Excellent Blu-ray",I liked the movie but it doesn't compare to the first Alien in story or shock factor. Quality is excellent in all the formats.
4,Good film - not meant to be as scary as Alien.,In every interview about the film - it was never intended to be as frightening as Alien. The 3D is amazing and I recommend getting it for your 3D home system. It does feel a bit like a prolog to something rather then actually being something - but compared to most films out there - it's extremely well done. Compare this to other A list sci-fi films of the year like John Carter (which I sort of liked in 3D) or Men in Black 3 (Which is also a decent film) this one is much - much better.
4,a gift for my son.,"he asked for it & liked it, but was disappointed there's no directors edition. he's happy with it though, so i am happy ."
3,Aliens prequel meets 2001 Space odesey,Watch the former two movies and you have the plot storyline. The whole movie is like a repeat with of a tall tale told around a camp fire the only thing . that saves this are the special effects. The main stars seemed to apologize for some of the dialog
2,Disappointing,"I was really looking forward to this movie, but it disappointed. The beginning started out as very intriguing and of course the special effects were great, then it fell into the old alien/monster gore fest that I was hoping it would avoid. I was looking for a more weightier an thoughtful movie. Oh well."
2,"""Scott"" doesn't rhyme with plot. Special effects great, story weak","Beautiful scenery in a few parts, great special effects (but frankly CGI is getting pretty boring), but my enjoyment of the movie was greatly lessened by a weak and incoherent story and sloppy details like scientists immediately jumping off their space ship onto a new planet without taking the necessary precautions to ensure they don't cause contamination or put themselves in danger. In this movie ""Scott"" doesn't rhyme with plot."
1,What a turd.....,"I was very excited to see this movie.Imagine then my disappointment.They took elements from Aliens 1 and 2, wrote them into a new script with pathetic dialogue, no surprises and a total lack of originality. It's one thing to use other peoples ideas and warp them into your own creation, what Mr. Scott has done is take his own ideas, chewed them up and shat them out and told everyone ""its a new movie, I promise it is!""And the ending? Oh look, they turned it into an Aliens prequill..... what a joke.Watch the trailer, its the best parts all rolled into 90 seconds."
2,kinda choppy,good movie but the HD was kinda choppy.. digitized a lil across the screen a few times. I liked the movie but was a little disappointed that the HD version had the digital problems...
4,lightningblackhorse,"I felt that Ridley Scott should have kept up with the no names to start theory. Charlize was not a good choice, she felt flat and like a writter that has a stash novel hidden, publishes it just to get by. Noomi Rapace, Michael Fassbender were the scene makers, but David the robot, took me back to Nash in the first Alien movie, what a great tie in, still; I felt cuts were intense and took from the movie, I would have sat for another hour, would you? ""Should have left them in!"" Good movie, Noomi was no Helen Ripley, but she held it together for Ridley Scott, too bad...like I said, good movie buy it for the collect."
2,So much promise...,"Going into this movie, I wanted to love it. I truly did. I was excited when the credits began, and as the movie progressed, the excitement waned. I know a lot of people hated this movie, and conversely, a lot of people loved it. I'm in the ""meh"" category. It had so much promise, but it left it all in the trailers.I don't care that it wasn't a direct prequel to Alien. I don't care that it left the ending wide open for a sequel. I do care that the story and characters were never fleshed out to the point where I was invested in what happened to them.There were several points where the movie showed flashes of brilliance, only to then to fall back into the convoluted mess that it was.Watching this movie is like going on a blind date. You're glad you experienced it, but you're more glad that it's over, and you can just move on."
3,Sometimes hard to understand,"While the overall plot and special effects were good, I found it hard to understand what the characters were saying at times."
3,ok muvie,the only problems is that I can't share with my family because the digital recording does not have Spanish audio nor subtitles so this fact is forcing me to bay the actual disk instead. this is very bad
2,Answers will be questioned,"Wow, this didn't even seem like a Ridley Scott film.For a laundry list of what's wrong here, you can read the other in-depth reviews, but the image of a couple of the main characters trying to outrun the path of a rolling spacecraft instead of dodging off to either side pretty much sums it up. The most ineptly manned trillion dollar mission ever.This film also underscores just how important a good soundtrack is. Go back and listen to how effective the soundtrack to the original ""Alien"" film is in supporting the awe, suspense and horror of the visuals. The soundtrack for ""Prometheus"" just doesn't cut it.Though I will watch this movie again for the sets and cinematography, it's too bad ""Prometheus"" has more in common with ""Alien Resurrection"" than Ridley's original classic."
2,Pro-messy-ness....,"See other reviews. Was a personal let down for me. Purchased only to supplement my Alien series movie collection. My views most closely match these reviewers:Take the Scientist's Survival Pop Quiz v2.0!, September 23, 2012just awful, October 20, 2012Prometheus is a Very Bad Movie-theus., October 2, 2012The special effect were cool, but too bad when I stick it in I can't bare to watch more than 10 minutes of it."
2,"Never Starts, then Never Ends",I'm still trying to figure out if the big reveal had any implications for the plot. I couldn't generate much sympathy for the characters as they weren't very fully developed. I think this is the last Ridley Scott effort I'll need to see.
2,Aliens Are laughing,wow glad i did not buy the dvd this was a over rated pumped up movie. short plot low budget retarded ending. how about that background music in the trailer. Sigourney Weaver laughed at this one.
4,Good story! Great Blu-ray,"Everything that makes blu-ray great is there (picture and sound). The movie is also very good, but was missing something 'just shy' of making it great. I had already seen it in theaters, so it was obviously good enough to be worth buying and seeing again. :-)"
4,Prometheus Blu Ray,"Standard Blu-ray disc, I did like the movie and the contrast is great on blu-ray compared to how I originally saw it on DVD."
1,Prometheus,Not good at all very disappointed in the movie I didn't even finish watching the movie. Not what expected I'm sorry I purchased the DVD!
1,Lost in Space,"Prometheus is a mixed-up, messed up prequel to the Alien series, and you would do best just to avoid seeing this at all. I loved the Alien series and am a huge sci-fi fan, but this film is a jumble of different ideas and stories forced together into one big pile. Granted, some of the CGI effects are great, but in the end you will see that there were so many plot holes in the story it dissolved and floated away. I certainly hope there is no sequel to this. Oh, and the acting is terrible, too."
4,Edge of your seat pic,"I love futuristic sci-fi movies and found this one breath-holding, sit on the edge of your seat spell binding. Actually was afraid of nightmares afterwards!"
2,"Nothing to see here, please move along","In its theatrical form, this movie is a straight-up botch. It is so poorly written and delivered that I have to wonder what Ridley Scott was thinking when he signed off on the whole mess, and I cringe to think that this was meant to be the kick off for a round of linked stories. Further, I would implore any fans of Alien or Scott who have not seen this yet to just avoid it entirely. It's that lame."
3,prometheus,"Interesting movie,great cinematics, but left a lot of unanswered questions. I guess they'll be answered in the next movie.The Alien Triology were more mysterious and nerve rackingMr King"
2,And it started so well . . . . . .,"Definately not an Alien prequel - sort of a sideways nod to the film, which is only fair since they re-used the H.R. Geiger props. Basically - they just bit off way more than they could chew with this one.This film reminds me very much of the movie ""Below"" - it doesn't know if if wants to be a sci-fi action film, a thriller, a horror, or a commentary. In the end, it does well holding your attention, but fails to satisfy. Seems like they just lost focus on what type of film they were trying to make - very sad, because it got off to a very good start. Delivers on the tag-line ""questions will be answered,"" just not the questions you thought should be answered.All things considered - a straight-up remake of Alien would probably have been a better film."
1,"Looks good, but everyone is dumb","If you can get past the serious, devastating series of mistakes - defying common sense - that the crew members make every few minutes, then this isn't a horrible movie. I had trouble getting into the suspense because everyone was always doing something so incredibly stupid that it took all the fear out of the situation. ""Oh, hey there cute little alien snake monster! Aren't you adorable with all your hissing! Who looks like a penis? YOU look like a penis, yes you do! Now, I know that I'm trapped in this crypt filled with mysteriously dead aliens with no way back to the ship in case anything happens, but you're just too cute not to pet! Oh no! Now I'm dead! Who could have possibly predicted this unforeseeable turn of events?!"""
3,Prometheus,Very expensive production along with a lot of special effects. Interesting and entertaining but a little too drawn out. Not enough action.
3,"Visual appealing, terribly written","I'm giving this movie three stars because of the stunning visuals, which is about all that it has going for it. There are just too many places where it feels like the screen writer didn't even try. We have archaeologist that seem unconcerned with contaminating new finds, biologist that think potentially dangerous lifeforms are meant to be played with, geologist/mappers who can't find their way out of some straight tunnels (and where was the command post with it's holographic projection?), women who can only run in straight lines, advanced yet somehow misogynistic medical devices, and top secret areas that are general left unlocked. I'm not disappointed that I watched the movie, because it *was* quite beautiful, but I have to say the that writing came close to being insulting."
4,great addition to the alien mythology,"great addition to the alien mythology. jj abrahams does a fantastic job directing. great cinematics, great sound, and the story is well paced."
4,complicated but good,"The movie is a bit complicated the first time around. It was easier to follow the second time, especially after researching it on the web. A lot of references that would go unnoticed by most people. Good sci-fi though."
2,Really?,"Extremely disappointing. Geiger sets were visually stunning, acting was mediocre, but the plot line was a total joke. The prerelease trailer contained scenes that were not in the download version."
2,Alien stamp all over it,Alien ship with surprise -- checkEvil Corporate conspiracy -- checkWoman main character -- checkDumb crew -- checkEvil robot -- checkUgly Alien fetus -- checkCreature bursts from the chest -- checkVicious monster -- checkFlamethrowers -- checkSacrifice for humanity -- checkSole woman survivor -- check
2,It was ok,I thought it seemed like an alien remake but not as good. The ending seemed rushed and fake. It was bloody but not really scarey.
3,Not the best but meh,Unnecessarily confusing at times the movie does have its fair share of thrills and oh my god moments- just not enough to make it great.
3,This movie works -- mostly,"This was a good movie for a night that had nothing else to do in it. It is one of the movies that I enjoyed while I watched it, but it was not one that really made an impact. Good for momentary pleasure if you like Sci-Fi."
1,Disappointing,I watched the 3 disc blu ray version of this film and it was just so disappointing.I found the story to be very thin as well as the supplements. If you want to see actor/director interviews they are in the 4 disc blu ray version.The look of the film is great but you spent no time with the characters to care about any of them. I found it laughable when the captain who stayed on the ship the entire time doing very little out of the blue had the 'complete' explanation of the canisters and how they got on the planet and why.It was a 'what?' moment - just like the Engineers. Theron had a cameo as well as Guy Pierce - they were completely wasted.Alien was a home run out of the park. Prometheus isn't even a convincing punt.Skip it.
3,"Good intentions,but predictable.","The concept was unique as in all Ridley Scott movies, but the plot was predictable with the usual suspects doing the same thing they always do. Still entertaining and visually impressive but not a 4 star rating."
1,So Badly Done,Acting and story line were nothing out of the ordinary and left much to be desired.I fell asleep a third of the way through.
3,Disappointing,"It had big shoes to fill and it didn't feel them. Watchable, but if you are looking for the story quality of the Alien movies, you will be disappointed."
3,Didn't do it for me,"Love Alien and Aliens. This just didn't do it for me. The FX were cool. The movie just tried to hard to move forward, be cool and intellectual. It seemed forced. Tried too hard to channel the first two alien films. Won't buy it but will see the sequels."
1,Total Let Down,"This movie was suggested by my son. I watched it with my eife, son, and daughter in-law. We all gfreed the it was a total letdown."
4,love it,I really liked the movie but felt they could have done so much more. Makes me believe we will see a part 2!
3,Not a fan.,Movie was ok but I'm not a fan of the alien series anyway. But i guess it was interesting none the less.
1,"So dumb, it was painful","So, let me get this straight, ancient astronauts are found and we make our way to their home world; it's the first contact with aliens. When they get there, the crew starts a bunch of petulant behavior and the chief scientist starts boozing it up. Geez, Hollywood, I guess you assume your entire audience is a bunch of freaking retards. Well, I suppose you're right. I spent $3.99 and all I got was 2.5 seconds of where the Alien came from. Hint:from a guy's gut.Actually, come to think of it, there was four bucks worth of information in this movie. If you are ever trying to run away from a giant ring shaped space ship that is falling down toward you and rolling along it's perimeter, turn 90 degrees and run, rather than run along the path of the falling space ship."
3,"Good, but not great sci-fi","This was an interesting movie. The movie's central idea about the origin of man was thought provoking. Some of the details from beginning to end were confusing, and I wonder if they were relevant to the plot. However, these questions might be resolved in another movie(?). I don't know, but if you eliminate that possibilty, the movie remains a bit too abstract for my taste, and I love sci-fi! Ridley Scott is normally great, but maybe his creative juices have finally dried up."
2,Pomethius,Predictable for a sci-fi movie and a bit boring Don't know what all the hype was about Most characters were very bland and lacked any personality Wished I had saved my money and bought something else
2,Don't pet the alien,"First, I have no idea why Charlize Theron was even in the movie. Her character was pointless. The 3D cinematic was captivating at times but not enough to wow me. The movie had potential. It was on the verge of being smart and philosophical but it did not fully deliver. Alien and Aliens are far superior because they were unique, the action was better, and the story was not as cheesy. Case and point (*this is sort of a SPOILER ALERT); don't assume a brand new species, or race, on a foreign planet is friendly."
1,"copycat, at best","Won't pretend I'm an intellectual or a pro critic...in hindsight, I'm pretty stupid to think anyone could, or would even try to, make a decent prequel to what is basically a space creature flick (Alien). I went to Prometheus simply based on the fact Alien is one of, if not the best, sci-fi movies ever made (partially due to its simplicity). I was expecting something on the same vein, yet new...what I got was a generic back story, copycat bits and pieces from the original Alien, a fake Sigourney Weaver, another talking severed android head (couldn't come up with anything else?), a lame octopus and a blatant setup for a sequel. I want a real ending...and a good one."
5,SINGLE DISC DVD,"THIS IS ALL ABOUT THE MOVIE NO LOTS OF EXTRAS VERY SIMPLE EDITION U GET THE TYPICAL 4 TRACK AUDIO AND SUBTITLES, I GOT FASCINATED WITH ALL THE PROMO CAMPAIGN WAS SO ORIGINAL AND SO I GOT HOOKED UP! DESPITE OF SAYING IT WAS A PRE-ALIEN MOVIE I GET INTO IT KNOWING IT WAS A STAND ALONE ADVENTURE! I GOT MYSELF A FEW SURPRISES, IN THE OVER ALL I SAY 5 STARS! SO GOOD LOOKING MOVIE; PERFECT EFFECTS ,ORIGINAL CHARACTERS,AND A PROMISE OF A SEQUEL LET YOU WONDERING WHATS GONNA BE.- I DON'T CARE ABOUT ALL NEGATIVE FEEDS OUT THERE THIS IS A MASTERPIECE FOR SCOTT R. FANS! MUST OWN!"
1,I just can't get it out of my mind,"So I am watching that opening scene with the ""Engineer"" and I keep thinking wax lips... He's got those Halloween Wax Lips!"
1,Terrible,"This movie was terrible.. I was SO looking forward to it, and had high hopes that Ridley would pull it off.. I mean prequal to the Alien series.. who wouldn't be excited about that?? One star for top notch visuals."
2,Strange,"I was really looking forward to watching this after my sister went on and on about how AWESOME it was....but it is just strangely stupid, I thought!"
5,Best 3D movie so far,"This is the best 3D movie, so exciting , fantastic visual effects. I keep hearing hearing the story doesnt make sense , well people its NOT supposed to, its Science fiction. I desperately want the DVD"
2,Rent it and be done with it.,"Great effects. Doesn't live up to the hype either in the mags or other media.I watched it twice. Just in case I missed something important. I didn't.Story disjointed. Often I am thinking don't open the basement door and walk downstairs. But they do. REALLY there is nothing scary about it unless you have not seen something coming out of ones mouth, chest or abdomen in other movies.The opening scene on ""Earth"". Needs a bit more explanation. He opens up a can of poison and drinks it. He dies. The end. Rush week on planet X! I would think futuristic people capable enough to do DNA engineering would have rudiments of the scientific method down. But then again, alot of discovery's have been made when the scientist uses himself as a Guinea pig.Then the other part of the movie starts.It was so bad I don't even care to see the sequel when it comes out. Because this one did not interest me."
4,Prequel to the Alien Movies,"I liked it! It brought the Alien movies together for me, and left room for another prequel in the future. If you liked Aliens you should like Prometheus!"
2,eh...,It was just okay. I guess I would have liked it more had it been advertised as a prequel but maybe not even then. Wasn't impressed.
5,Excellent Sci-Fi,"Loved every minute of this film. The best kind of sci-fi, the kind that asks the big questions of life. Hopefully they'll make more of these!"
1,Don't Waste Your Time,"I promise you, I was entirely excited for this movie when the previews blared all over the theater screens and TV spots. Yet what it delivered was an unenjoyable, stupid, absolutely frustrating waste of film. There is no ""thought provoking"" mystery to the whole thing, it's just a badly written movie that does NOT deserve to be owned, let alone be a part of the wonderful, honestly well made Alien films.Answers, there are none. Questions? You'll have plenty, and not about ""why are we here?"" more along the lines of ""Why go through all the trouble?""Rent the movie, perhaps, but be prepared for a disappointing, blah film."
1,amazon online movie,"Bad picture , skips alot and very slow down load. Not 1080P picture. Alot of bad pixel and very slow. Sound quilty is really bad too, cant hear what there talking about. I need to rise the volume very high just to hear talking but very static. Am using comcast hisg speed internet too.P.S Netflix is still better"
3,3D skipped QA on this release.,"I will say I can see all the conflicting reviews on the action and what it started as and what it finished as. Bottom line for me it peaks my intrest in the next installment and did not put me to sleep. Just knowing that we will eventually endup at the original Aliens is good enough for me.I am an middle school 3D fan 70's early 80's [when 3D would pop off the theatre screen ""the operating table in Warhols Frankenstein hovered over the first 5 rows of audience I was seated 3/4 of the way back in the theatre.......But do not buy the 3D version of this film the depth is just inches above 2D. I am disapointed in modern 3D but have come to love my Vizio 42"" passive 3D I will only buy 3D movies. They don't pop but the depth is awesome, Prometheus has almost no depth let alone anything close to pop. The Final Destination 3D films at least have a little pop and great depth.Don't wast the xtra bucks unless you can sell the 3D and DVD versions to keep the 2D for your self."
3,To little to late,This was a movie that should have come out before all the alien vs... it's an ok movie but not a must see or rush see. This is probably my leasted favorite of the franchise.
3,"Aliens, dejavu all over again","Some impressive scenes. Good special effects. However, too many correlations to the original Aliens movie.Characters personalities/behaviors difficult to believe given their assignments and qualifications.This could have been a great movie. Just too many dejavu's for me. And, I LOVE sci-fi!"
4,Kept my attention,"While this movie is not up there with 2001, it has a little bit of the same feel. I enjoyed it, kept my attention."
3,For Special Effects Aficionados,"A prequel to the ""Alien"" films. Special effects make this film worth watching. Otherwise, the story is so-so. There are a couple of great lines - ""If they made us, who made them?"" - ""Sometimes you first have to destroy before you create."" Reminded me of a passage in Jeremiah 1:10: ""I have appointed you...To pluck up and to break down, to destroy and to overthrow, to build and to plant."""
2,Great look crap story,I did not care for this movie it was not a great story but the run at being the beginning of the alien series way cool.
4,not too bad,"Not too bad of a movie. It's no ""Alien,"" but I like where they went with this. I thought several parts were a little ""B movie"" quality, especially surrounding characterization, but is is a prequel."
3,Not bad,"It was worth the time to watch. Good effects, good acting and storyline was good. It was worth watching. (:"
1,Sucks,It is a cheap ripoff of Aliens with bad acting and a convaluted script. Dont waste your time or money.
4,I couldn't wait for this to come out,"I was looking forward to the prequel to Alien. But like Scott said in an interview, it isn't quite a prequel, but it isn't entirely unrelated either. This also has an interesting deleted scene at the end. If you're a sci fi buff or are interested in the Alien series, you don't want to miss this."
5,Buy this for your children...,"I've given this little pocket machine 5 stars for nostalgic reasons. I am not too sure how well it would hold up to today's standards, with kids having all sorts of snazzy pocket devices that I'm sure have at least a thousand times more memory than this.The Franklin Spelling Corrector is the reason why into my adult years, I have had impeccable spelling. It was instrumental is developing my love for words more than any teacher, professor or book."
5,10-year old son loves it,"My 10-year old son (with ADHD) is very intelligent. However, spelling is not his strong suit. Even as a small child, phonics meant nothing to him, and although we have tried various programs/methods to increase his spelling efficacy, he has not been able to master the basics. Thankfully, he is able to look at a word, and can usually tell if what he's written ""looks right"" or not. His incredible memory has allowed him to see and remember some words. The spelling corrector has really helped him to begin to master some of the ""spelling rules,"" while continuing to memorize other words."
4,it's good,"like it. would recomend to outher people,it's easy on and has alot of words to show,when you search for words."
3,FRANKLIN SPELLING CORRECTOR,"The letters are smaller than I thought they would be. I was a little disappointed. Its informative, but thats it."
5,Great,Being taking this product for a week now and can notice results. I checked other health food stores and amazon.com had the best price on this product. I have had no side effects from taking this product.
1,Smoke From Controls On First Use,"I noticed a bit of smoke rising from this iron when I first plugged it in. I figured it was just burning off some residue or small bit of plastic packaging from the iron. As it heated up, the amount of smoke increased. I soon realized that the smoke was not coming from the iron surface but from the hole on top where the temperature control was. I am not sure if this is standard but I also noted that the control dial did not seem to be centered in the opening as I would think it should be. I don't care much for smoke coming from inside my electric tools. This item is being returned to Amazon for a refund."
5,Great!!!!!!,"My wife had been looking for these for some time locally, but no luck. I gave it a shot, even after reading some of the reviews. She loves them and they have been great in the car so far."
3,ok cd,this album is good but not great for your dance songs you would love to have remembered for the 90s
2,disappointed,Only one of the hand held gamepads worked. By the time we figured it out I had thrown the box away.
4,Great game for younger SpongeBob fans!,"I bought this game for my 6 year old, he has been begging for a SpongeBob game for a while now. I gave it four stars over all only because it was a little tough starting for him. BUT he has quickly figured it all out and after just a few days of playing he has gotten several things unlocked and still has much more to go. He has thanked me a million times for this game. :)Plus....it's cute just to watch him play. Lol.**Update** It's now May 3rd, 2012 and my son is seriously addicted to this game. I had to set up rules about how long and how many times a day he could play. Even though he has been playing it as much as absolutely possible, he isn't even close to done with it!I love all the levels, milestones, and even obstacles in this game. It gets more in depth with each level but with each level my son gets so much more excited.And major bonus: It's still adorable to watch him play it. ^_^"
4,Fun but difficult,"In a nutshell: great platformer similar to Jak and Daxter or Ratchet and Clank. But lagging in eye candy, richness, and playability. It's worth buying if you're a diehard platformer fan, a SB fan or have younger children who like the show.It's a very true translation of the show. All the sets and characters in the show were also in the game. Kudos there.My four year has mastered all the character moves, the 3d environment, and some of the boss levels. So the game begins relatively easy. But the difficulty ramps up very quickly. By the latter levels, Spongebob et al needs to find their way through mobius like mazes, difficult multi-step rewards, and a whole lotta nothing. Progress became very frustrating and tedious around the 70% mark.The game misses it's target audience a bit with difficulty. A bit rough around the edges, especially on playability. I'd give it a 5 if it had a bit more refinement along the lines of Jak and Daxter."
5,One of the best spongebob Games!,"Spongebob has been a fan of mine for years! I have simply adored the video games for quite some time, and now I have just bought this game. I have not played a game like this in such a long time, and I'm elated to find this game because it has everything to do! Literally, you can go anywhere you want if you have a specific amount of spatulas, golden spatulas. You can smash thing, you have bubble powers, and you even slide with your tongue. You play as Spongebob, Patrick, and Sandy. The robot boss's are characters you would never guess. Especially the first boss in jellyfish fields. Hint: not a robot, but fair to beat. I totally recommend this game to anyone who wants to have fun!"
5,Lightning Rod,Best product ever made. I have used this product for over 20 years. It is a very strong light weight and sensitive rod. I would buy no other !
3,"Crazy, Just Crazy","This book is...I don't even know what to call it. It's truly is horrible for the first 100 pages. It's nothing like you've ever read or ever would expect from Lolita Files. I bought it (for like a quarter) despite all the bad reviews cause I just had to see for myself. Besides I usually like different stuff anyway. But as I was reading it, I couldn't believe this was the same author who wrote Child of God. BUT WAIT, HERE'S THE CRAZY PART, after about the 100th page, this novel gets insanely good! I mean it gets AMAZINGLY good!!! So if you can hang in there for that long (and the first part is terrible) then this is a really good story. I don't know what was going on with Miss Files when she penned this one, but it's definitely a bittersweet achievement."
2,Library book!,"I do not like the fact that my book was a library book. If that was the case, I would have went to my own library and got the book. I do like the book but I don't like all the labeling over it. I had to take off stickers from the book!"
3,what the hell?,"i've read ""Scenes from a Sista"" and ""Blind Ambitions"" and i love them both. this book just pissed me off. first, i thought that Beryl would find this man she was looking for. then on being introduced to Penn, the amazingly smart and sexy writer who treats women like play toys, i knew it was all going to end badly. Penn pissed me off. the ending pissed me off. this damn book just pissed me off."
1,BAD build quality and so-so image quality,"My coolpix 2500 suddenly went dead after 14 months. This is the first tech product I owned that has ever died on me. I will never buy another Nikon product. The picture quality is so-so, tends to have red-eye."
1,this camera is not good,awsome when you take pictures that is not woving...because of the delay(about 2seconds)you cant take pictures the way you want.
2,Neat Camera but went dead after 19 months,"This was pretty good deal for me or atleast it looked to me till 1 week before. One fine day, it suddenly stopped working and it is showing me image only when the swivel lens is turned towards the photographer. Now it has started showing me SYSTEM ERROR and makes lot of noise when I turn on\off the camera. This is nice deal provided you are ready to spend couple of hundered dollars for 12-20 months of use. After that be ready to buy a new one."
1,Don't buy kindle edition,"I bought the kindle version for my computer and iPad. Absolutely horrible. Poor bitmap scans of the originals so bad that the words aren't even readable. They ""fixed"" this by retyping the words out below the scans. Totally wrecked the books for us. If you want to see how NOT to turn a wonderful classic into an ebook, just buy this one."
4,The Source for Nonverbal Learning Disorders,"I would highly recommend this book to educators or parents who recognize a learning problem in their child, that doesnot seem to ""fit"" in the ""usual"" learning disability category. My child's resource teacher recommended this book to me since I could not understand why he never fit into the ADD/ ADHD dyslexic ""mold"" completely. By reading this book I can now work on the specific needs of the child without implementing things that may not work. A real ""eye opener""Thank you Sue Thompson for bringing out a book on this ""silent"" misunderstood disability."
4,My Favorite,This is my favorite piano book. I got this for my grown daughter who is taking piano lessons. The songs are fun and easy to play. The illustrations are not only beautiful but educational since there are captions that explain the different works of art displayed. Another positive is that there are chords shown for those who play the guitar. Every home should have one of these books. I wish I had ordered two since my copy has been used so much I need to replace it.
2,Stickers smell like an electrical fire,"My 6 year old daughter LOVES this product, however I have been searching the house high and low for a ""hot"" smell, plastic burning, electrical fire related and found that it was the stickers!! Has anyone else had this issue? It says ""Made in China"" but I can't find any recalls on the product."
4,LOUNGE MUSIC MASTER,"I ordered this after watching Beyond the Sea. Wanted to see the real thing. Darin is the pinnacle lounge performer (right down to the bad toupee), with kitchy renditions of his big hits and some terrific covers. Just can't keep from grinning as you watch this video. I expected an SNL Bill Murray version of Bridge Over Troubled Water, but Darin was masterful in his understated interpretaion of the S & G classic. I remember watching shows like this with my parents, sitting at our TV trays in front of the tube, which we did every night of my childhood. I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the variety shows of the late 60's and early 70's. It's a classic!"
1,The Dark Side of Lounge Music,"I have always heard Bobby Darin, I have some of his live recordings, and always thought he was great. I bought this DVD, thinking he would swing like Frank did in his TV specials. Wow. It is sad to see him like this. Maybe it was the time (the 70's as opposed to Frank's 60's TV special) but if you ever wonder where Bill Murray got his inspiration for the lounge singer for his SNL skits, this is it. Painfully cheesy arrangements and embarrassingly cheesy audience pandering, make this painful to watch for anyone who had always loved the Darin sound. It seemed that he was trying to do too many things at once, cover too many genres, all the time trying to be current and hip. Unfortunately it was the 70's, and no one could be hip.Do yourself a favor and buy ""Bobby Darin Live at the Copa"" CD and just listen. Use your imagination, don't see this and destroy the illusion."
3,Fun but didn't last,"My daughter received Blue as a gift for her 1st birthday and loves it. She loves everything Blues Clues and loves to dance. After only 3 months, Blue doesn't sing anymore. We're very disappointed. She also got Hokey Pokey Elmo at the same time and he's still going strong. I wish Blue had lasted longer. :("
4,"Cute, cute, cute!","So far so good! My daughter is just about to turn 2, and the Blue Clues fever has hit, (along with BoohBah, and Teletubbies). She hasn't had too much exposure to the ""new"" talking and dancing blue though, only the ""old,"" quiet Blue from her 6 year old brothers old videos. Either way, she saw this Blue at the store, and it's now dancing away in the playroom, with the new video that came with it. She has no problem carrying it around, although I found it to be a little bulky, and hard because of the mechanism inside. The song is cute, the dance is cute, Blue is cute!"
5,Perfect,potty training my grandneice is so much nicer with these little panties. She love Tinker Bell and she doesn't like to get them dirty. Perfect and great price also. Thanks.
3,Good lord,"Wow, this book is about as dense as the crust of the earth. It takes at least a few reads over to understand what the arguments are. While the arguments in this book are very well articulated, I found myself wanting to shoot myself in the face sometimes while reading this book. It can be really boring, but brings up some very interesting ideas of 80's culture and society."
2,"Jack, please pick your pace","I got started on Jack McDevitt with 'Polaris' and 'Seeker'. Both Imaginative stories with an exciting, high-paced plot. I'd expected the Academy series to show the same originality, and I must say, 'Chindi' definitely does.But I'm sorry to say that where I found 'Omega' just a trifle tedious, 'Odyssey' is a downright disappointment. The Academy series feels like a slide downhill.'Odyssey' takes over 300 pages before it finally picks up any pace, only to ramble on to its conclusion 120 pages later. If you decide to go for this read, just skip the first 3/4 of the book and pick up from there.Better still, start on the Alex Benedict, much more value for your money."
2,"Tedious, disappointing, and did I mention tedious","The book cover states: ""The Logical heir to Isaac Asimov and Arthur C. Clarke."" Those guys should sue.This book has echoes of Clarke and started well. But the story plods to nowhere. The climax is such a major disappointment I checked to see if there were pages missing from my copy. There weren't.Sad to say the other negative reviews got it right.'Nuf said."
3,"Enjoyable, but not his best","I won't bore you with a plot summation (the previous reviewers took care of that), but I will defend the author's right to produce an enjoyable (if mediocre) addition to an otherwise fun to read ""beach book"" series. I read the negative reviews before purchasing my copy, but they did not deter me. As I have stated before, any Jack McDevitt is better than none, and if Mr. McDevitt is getting as cynical and irasible as his character, Mr. MacAllister (hmmm...two ""Macs!), so be it. I will continue to purchase, read, and enjoy (to varying degrees) anything he publishes. Hang in there, Jack, keep up the good (hopefully improved) work, and better luck next time."
1,Junk addition to the Hutch Series,"I'd read all of the previous installments in The Hutch Series, and while the later books in the series had become repetitive in theme and action, they were at least readable.With ODYSSEY, McDevitt adds to the pile of scientific junkers being produced by the leftists who seem to dominate the SciFi writer's guild. We are again hit hard over the head with the notion that there WILL be CATASTOPHIC HUMAN-CAUSED GLOBAL WARMING enviromental damage in the near future, to the point that the Green Party replaces the Democratic Party. YAAAAWWWN! Somewhere there is a story inside, but I couldn't find it - indeed, that may be why the book is entitled ODYSSEY, because you will have to go on one to try and find the story!... and I'd forgot about McDevitt's NAU (North American Union), in which he has actually managed to kill off the USA. I'll definately be more careful about buying any more books from this fellow American."
2,Mostly Politics,"Be advised that this book is about politics and people. By page volume, there is little adventure and much commentary.I wish I wasn't forced to give a star rating. I hesitate to make an absolute value judgment as other people may enjoy this.I would say that the cover art and interior graphic design imply a different type of book than this turned out to be."
4,Decent story all the way around,"Not one of McDevit's best, but a good story with loads of action none the less."
1,"after three years of use, don't waste your money","Just a quick warning on this product. We've owned the phone for three years now, we have gone through 3 handset and we have one about the go down. There isn't any one reason that would help Identify the problem, each phone falling in a different way. And now the price to replace looks to have jump seventy dollars? Too bad, it looks like a neat product but troublesome and doesn't last too long."
4,Inspiring,"This book is very inspiring. I can identify with many of the same emotions. The only reason I dodn't give it 5 stars is that it is short, without longterm information on her child. I was left wondering ""How's he doing now?"" I think parents of CP kids always wonder how they are going to be when they ""grow up."" And this book ends when the child is still very young."
5,awesome,this movie is so great and was childhood fave of mine and of my boyfriend. so i bought it for him for his birthday a few years ago and we still watch it with out any problems
1,Chrap! Just Plane Chrap!,I coudn't stand this movie as a kid. And ofter the last time I was in a video store I read the back just to know what it was again. GOD NOW I HAD TO REMEMBER HOW MUCH IT REACKED! The story keeps on jumping by makeing you wonder if this is realy happing or if it's just a dream! That the main problem with the movie. While all the charectors are trying to be neat they are neather interesting OR origanal! If your a fan of recreating M.S.T.3K then why not I'm think I should do the same thing. One last thing is that another reason is I have been haveing dreams about this movie. Wird!
5,A Fantasy joy ride!,I've really enjoyed the movie. I just wish they would make a DVD of this film! It's a dreamy tale to enjoy over and over! Don't let this film be a lost memory. make it a reality buy it1
5,I love little nemo!,This movie is fantastic! I love it as a child and still love it now! a must have!
5,Great debut from an indie artist,"Jeremy Manjorin has what a lot of the people in the music industry today lack, originality and a hell of a lot of talent.The music is inspired, the lyrics are great and the vocals are amazing.I'm eager to hear the follow-up album to this great debut!"
5,Very Happy With This Coffee,I am getting ready to order my 3rd 5 lb bag. I have been very happy with this mix. Great coffee for the price.
5,best coffee cheap price,wasn't sure what to expect from this as most coffee is hit or miss but what a pleasant surprise and i am so glad i joined the monthly delivery now i can have great coffee always !!!!
3,okay for fun but not to be taken seriously,"One day, I'll ask the question and it will say ""yes"" and the next day it will say ""no."" I do have to say that, many times I thought the answer should be one thing and disregarded the dice and weeks or months later discovered the dice were right. The problem with using something like this on yourself is that you have an idea of what you want the answer to be and this can skew the results."
3,The Best Track on the Whole Thing!,"OMG! You have to check out track 44 of the mp3's on the first cd of the compilation. Its called ""Outside"" and its by this band Overise. And I just mean its one of the best songs I've heard in so long. Up there with Konstantine in its emotional depth, but sorry no pianos. These guys rock!! I hope to see more of them in the future."
4,The shat,"They are decent I wanted more of a darks purple color but these meet all the expectations that I wanted, great product very easy to install love amazon muah kisses(:"
3,Ingram's film was more than a war or antiwar film...,"It introduced American audiences and especially American women to a glamorous international money aristocracy shuttling between Buenos Aires and Paris, between dives and thé dansants, studios and salons...Such milieus had been presented on the screen before--but always with frowning disapproval... Nor was the Latin Lover a novelty... Probably half the villains of the prewar screen were Latin--but they were sneering, greasy, black-hearted cads...Now the same character reappeared as a romantic Apollo who treated women with courtesy and deference but whose eyes promised (what the villains had threatened) that behind the deference, and behind the bedroom door, other, more exciting qualities would emerge--skill and experience...The magnetic pull Valentino exerted on millions of women signaled that they were tired of awkward love-making, on screen and off..."
4,Keith Taylor edition of the film,"The transfer is clean but a little soft. Taylor's composition and execution of the music is solid, reflecting what is happening onscreen by and large. His accompaniment is tasteful and subdued.The master used appears to be an early video transfer, probably VHS.I wish Warner Archive would release this...or better yet that the restoration from David Gill & Kevin Brownlow which was released to laserdisc would be released to DVD."
5,Purple Rain,This is a awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are all of them. if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do
4,Great Receiver and Boombox for great service!!,"As mentioned in my other satellite radio reviews, I have both Sirius and XM and I like Sirius much more than the XM. I like the music channels on Sirius more and Sirius has much more exclusive programming. The Sportster receiver and boombox is great for satellite radio on the move. Great for bringing it outdoors to a park or the beach, whatever. The only thing that I wish this receiver had is the ability to record. The inability to record and the fact that the Sirius Orbiter boombox that I had sounded a little better when playing crisp sounding highs. Overall a great boombox, just make sure that you buy some 4500mAh nickel-metal hydride rechargeable batteries with it!"
4,Married But Still Looking,"Don't be fooled or turned off by the title. Travis does an excellent job of being ""real"" in his book. If you're looking for a few good Black men, read the book."
5,Good Book !,"THIS BOOK WAS GREAT ,A REALISTIC PLOT LOADED WITH DRAMA.I WOULD RECCOMEND it TO ANYONE...TRAVIS HUNTER IS AN EXCELLENT WRITER ,ALL HIS BOOKS HAVE AN INSIGHTFUL MESSAGE IN THEM AND THATS WHAT A GOOD BOOK IS ABOUT."
2,dull,"My children age 3 and 6 were bored by this video after watching it only once and they don't watch a lot of ""junk"" t.v. It is educational, but it didn't hold the interest of my children long enough for them to learn anything. Maybe I can get them to watch it on a car trip, when they are trapped in their car seats?"
3,Nobody asked you to say anything.,"This CD features the ranting and raving of two aging alcoholics. They were taped screaming and yelling at each other by their neighbors. These guys aren't happy drunks, they are angry drunks. Their vulgar, hateful, homophobic rants are actually pretty amusing. But it's also kind of sad hearing these two losers. They don't make drunkenness seem like it's very fun, that's for sure."
3,Mixed Opinion,"Not sure what to say regarding this book. The scene with the accidental phone number mixup always sounded a bit far fetched to me. The cover art was poor, but yet the book was a decent read. The brothers seemed to limit their travelling somewhat in this one. Worth reading but far from the series elite. Give it a weak 3 star rating. RATED C"
2,Go Vac Go....OUT!,I'm really disappointed with this product. Thanks to the other reviewers on amazon I decided to get this product even though I live overseas. To my surprise hairs make the roller stuck in no time and without this mechanism this vac will not pick up a single crumb. Ive had to take it apart twice already in a short amount of time and the hairs just keep getting to it. Plus its really noisy. It might be good for kids but not for serious household use. If I could do it over again Id definately go with another brand/model.
4,Kids love it,"I would say it works pretty well for what we need it for. Our little girl loves to use it. We have area rugs that get dog hair built up in a short time and this thing gets it all off. It's her chore and now she loves to do it.It does a decent job on carpet and hard floors. Of course there will alway be the bits that you have to attack a couple of times but it does the job. This is not made for big areas, just small jobs, as the dirt compartment fills up quickly. The run time is about 5 to 7 minutes so that is why it didn't get that extra star."
3,NOT AS GOOD AS IT SHOULD BE,"AFTER PURCHASING THE BISSELL 3300 GO VAC, I WAS EXCITED, YET QUICKLY DISSOPOINTED WITH THE 12 MINUTES OF VACUUM TIME. IT PICKS UP OKAY BUT THE CHAMBER FOR THE DIRT IS VERY SMALL. I OWN 2 DOGS AND USE IT ONLY IN MY KITCHEN, AND THE DOGS HAIR GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE TUNNEL THAT BRINGS THE DIRT TO THE CHAMBER WHICH HOLDS IT. THEN I PUT MY FINGER IN THERE TO PULL OUT THE HAIR SO THAT DIRT PARTICLES CAN GET INTO THE DIRT CHAMBER. ALL THIS TAKES UP TIME THAT I THOUGHT THE VACUUM WAS GOING TO SAVE BUT HASNT. SO I WOULD NOT RECCOMEND IT."
5,I've had mine for 2 years,I've had my Go Vac for well over 2 years. Almost all of our floors are tile with area rugs. I have 2 dogs & 2 kids. We use it constantly for quick clean-up; it has yet to stop working or slow down. Buy it! You'll be glad you have it.
5,I love it!,"My daughter got the Barbie Bissell this past Christmas and I love it!! She hardly gets a chance to use it because I am always using it for myself!I am going to order the blue one for me! It really works and provides instant satisfaction! With the small dirt cup,you can see how much you cleaned with out a big bag."
2,"Other than the Jorge Ben, terrible","With all the great Brazilian music to choose from, this is the best Byrne comes up with? Other than the admittedly great Jorge Ben tracks, a really poor cross-section. I could have come up with better Veloso selections by hitting shuffle in iTunes."
4,still the Best Snoop Era,"while Snoop Dogg is going strong and has much longevity and not slowing down, for me the best and peak and Prime era of the Dogg still was on Death Row Records. musically and vocally the hunger and urge spoke. the songs and videos were all on point. Snoop and Dr.Dre were unstoppable back in the day. strong Production, and more importantly the voice at the center of it Snoop Doggy Dogg."
3,Off tha hook,"Deathrow is at it again, puttin out yet another snoop dogg cd. But dont get me wrong this cd is a best of wit some unrealeased , and it is so tight. This has old school snoop wit dre , is a great party cd , damn every song is good and they all bring out good vibes , go out and buy this , if u dont u will be sorry later , yeah westside for life"
1,If you've read Haunted Illinois save your money,"This book was a gross disappointment and a waste of money. Repeating the stories and the history in Haunted Illinois relative to Alton, throwing in a few new and adding a (very) few about some nearby towns, made for a very dissapointing book. There is a great deal of vagueness about the location of a number of the sites he writes about. There are plenty of new typos and errors, which would make one hope that any forthcoming books get a good proof reading before printing. Since that appears to be a commonality of his work, I am not expecting it to come about. Oh, and as far as the invitation to look him up if you visit Alton (presumably by stopping by his shop/museum) - apparently that is out of date or another typo - he doesn't welcome visitors - not even buyers and fans of his work."
1,dry as a cracker,"Ok, first of all... you'd think if you were going to steal someone else's stories to use in your book you'd spice them up a little instead of making it drag as long as possible and as boring as can be. I know for a fact that almost all the stories in Mr.Taylor's book aren't his own. So before you go on and on praising his brilliance, you need to know the truth. He's nothing but a thief. And a lousy one at that.Save your money... or buy the excorcist if you want a thrill. This man is not a writer, nor is he interesting."
5,Some people never learn,"Sundance Morgan after he shot a freind of Smoke Jensen's in the back got his ear shot off by Jensen and sent on his way, now after years of avoiding attempts on his life by other gunfighters and robbing people he's formed a gang of killers, theivies, and rapists to take up north to the SugarLoaf to kill the mountain man and put a price on Jensen's head as well. Smoke and Sally Jensen meanwhile take in a starved teenager named Cal and begins to teach him the way of the mountain man, meanwhile Morgan and his gang cut a trail of broken and destroyed lives. The people in town hear he's coming and set up a trap, cutting down the numbers while Smoke, Cal, and Pearlie work on cutting up the rest making one look as if Jensen threw him off the top of the mountain. A good read about frontier justice."
3,not my cup of tea,"Please note that the focus of this book is photojournalism; and that is only covers about a decade of time, around the 1990s.I can't fault the book for this, and I should have read the independent editorial reviews more carefully, but I thought this was a collection of photographs that spanned Magnum's *entire* history especially as the Amazon review stated ""Magnum Degrees is a selection of agency photos that illustrates the range of subject matter and imagery the photographers have captured over the last half century.""That said, I was struck by many of the photographs in the book - in fact many of them, due to their subject matter, are alarming. As a compilation of 500+ pages, however, it was overwhelming. I wonder what a more focused selection of pictures might have achieved."
5,Quality & consistently reliable,"I consider Verbatim to be the most reliable brand of writeable dvds. Of the hundreds of burns I have done, I have never had a burn fail that appeared to be due to a bad disk. There is probably the occasional bad disk, but certainly no more than 1 in 100, and I believe far less.The lightscribe images are the best quality of any brand of disk I've used, though I've only used lightscribe with 2 or 3 brands.This is the brand I recommend when anyone asks for my advice."
5,Awesome!,"I love creating Lightscribe DVDs, as it provides a beautiful personalization to the DVD itself. The Verbatim Lightscribes are very good. I have never had trouble with them and so far, all of them are works great. I would definitely be ordering them again soon!"
5,Burn it more than once!!,"These work really well - if you are having trouble seeing what was burnt onto the label side, you can burn it as many times as you want. Just close the cd case and click print again. It has a spot that tells it where to start so it will burn right over the original image and just make it darker. Don't do it more than 3 times because after that you begin to lose contrast and it starts getting worse... but it gets it very black!"
2,Nice Looking....Poor Fit,"THE PLASTIC CLIPS ARE BRITTLE AND BREAK EASILY. ADDITIONALLY, IT HAS A WIRE BOX PLUG THAT'S NOT OEM AND THEREFORE THERE'S NO ROOM FOR IT BEHIND THE MIRROR. IN ESSENCE, I HAD TO GLUE THESE LENSES ON TO GET THEM TO FIT.**SIDE NOTE: RECON WILL NOT WARRANTY ANY PRODUCTS PURCHASED ON AMAZON, EBAY, ETC... IT'S NOT SPECIFIED ON THEIR WEBSITE, BUT I LEARNED THIS FIRSTHAND."
3,At least it's something.,"Well it's not all new, but at least we get a few originals. For the most part though this is a covers album. It may me short, but it's also sweet. Songs from Prince, Marilyn Manson, Bowie, and Depeche Mode all get the Berlin treatment. We even get a cover of ""For What It's Worth"". And truth be known, I really like it. Also included is their own hit ""No More Words"" from a VH1 show. Like I said, at least we're getting something from them, and as I glance at the cover, I see Terri still looks as good as she sounds. Overall, I say ""4play"" is fun."
1,Horrible,Cheaply made D list documentary. I was highly dissapointed and plan to burn this disgrace. It's not worth the cost for the box.
2,"First Few DVD's Are Informative, Then They Repeat Themselves","This is a pretty good expose on the history of the Mafia. I am nowhere near an expert in such things, but this set interested me as I have read the occasional Mafia novel, and this set was just so dang cheap.The first few DVD's were pretty entertaining and informative, going through the history of how the Mafia came into existance. From Bonnie and Clyde to John Gotti it was pretty good.After a few DVD's though it started repeating itself. The same Bonnie and Clyde clips, same Gotti stuff too. One of the DVD's as a matter of fact seems to be just a summary of what the other four DVD's went through.I probably won't watch these again, but I learned a little anyways.The quality is pretty poor, but I didn't expect much. I knew it was just some type of program copied from an A & E special or something. Plus what do you expect from old news clips anyways."
4,"fun, easy to remember songs","The whole family enjoys the music on this disc! My husband (who's first language is Spanish--South American) says the wording is akward, but he sings along with the rest of us--so fun and simple. And it's so great that the book has the translation of most of the songs. Another bad thing...I wish it didn't have so much talking."
4,"Anything for ""LOST"" is pretty wonderful.","Love this LOST Hatch. Received good service - fast. McFarlane toys does a great job on their figures. Also have Sawyer - he is pretty hot!! Thanks for selling the Hatch, I've really enjoyed it!"
1,Whispers of now,"Waste of money, terrible, it annoys me instead of empowering me to be in the present. Not a good representation of the book, ""The Power of Now"". Save your money."
3,Good but not great,"This is the best priced for the money but it is not as thick or as protective as the oil from ""Art of Shaving"" which does a better job.I love TH shaving cremes but this and their shampoo line are terrible."
1,I still haven't received the item - four months later.,"I'm sure the seller will say it (both times) got lost in the mail. Yea, it's possible. But after ordering this piece in late December, I still don't have it in late April! I just don't know.How can I get a refund?"
3,Problems with inserting this into Slot A,"I just received the memory card today and when I plugged it into my Wii, it read in Slot B but not in Slot A. I searched to see if anyone else had similar problems and I found a few people with this same issue. It turns out Slot A and Slot B are different sizes on the Wii and while Nintendo-brand memory cards fit both slots, the Madcatz does not always.The solution seems to be to slip in some paper (not too much) between the memory card and the slot in order to wedge the Madcatz a little more snugly into Slot A. At this point this seems to work, but nevertheless, it's a little disappointing to have to jerry rig this memory card in order for it to be read.Oh, and like the previous reviewer, I also had Resident Evil 4 and some Donkey Kong memory on the card as well, although it came in an unopened package. Weird. Also, no case."
1,Corrupted Data,I bought this memory card and saved a lot of games. Then a couple days later it said file is corrupted and it said that with all the games. It is not worth money because it will do that.
2,Yuck!,"As others have stated, the winch does not launch. We took it back to the store. The new one also did not launch. We took it back again and got an employee to help us. He opened 2 of them right off the shelf. None of them would launch. The instructions simply say to press the launch button. Ha! We exchanged this piece of junk for 2 heroes and the police car. Until Fisher-Price corrects this rampant problem, I can only recommend buying something else. We have tons of Rescue Hero toys. This URV thing is the only one that I'd consider junk. I didn't even mention the fact that this thing takes 7 batteries! 4 C's and 3 AAA's!"
3,Heads Up,"These batteries don't come charged.Amazon sent me these as a replacement for batteries that were missing from the package of an electronics item I ordered. Shouldn't have been a problem because (in my experience) rechargeable batteries usually come pre-charged. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case here. The back of the packaged says charge new batteries before using, so it's not a fluke."
5,Excellent!,"Great stuff. Dwyane Allman w/ Herbie Mann, how can that not be excellent? If you don't own it, get it...you won't be disappointed."
3,Good but incomplete for people who struggle in math,"Arco's Military Flight Aptitude Tests study guide gives you a good overview of the subjects that you will be tested on. If you have a strong backround in basic physics and math, then you should be able to get by with this book. But if you need extra help relearning math and physics, then I would recomend buying Kaplans GRE study guide, since it will actually teach you the concepts (I stink at math, so I really needed a book that put the concepts in simpler terms, so that I could do well on the math word problems).Arco's MFAT just has sample questions, but it does teach you some stuff about the flight material you will need to learn. So I recomend you buy it, because you not going to find any book that can teach you some of the unique flight (and natical if your joining the Navy) material that you will find in Arco's book. But if you need a math and physics update, then buy Kaplans GRE study guide.Hope this helps and good luck."
5,Aptitude = Altitude,"The ARCO Military Test Tutor is amazing! It really helps, and the practice tests are amazing!"
5,Good value,"I wanted to purchase the Olde Thompson 20-Jar Stainless-Steel Square Spice Rack for our grandson's wedding gift. After reading customer reviews of it on Amazon.com, the only complaint was that it didn't have additional labels for spices other than those that were included in the jars. I was able to purchase the spice rack and these additional labels for less than the spice rack alone sold for on Bed Bath & Beyond where they had their bridal registry. (Including shipping & handling charges) We couldn't be happier!"
4,Hours of grinding fun!,"This game is a lot of fun! Like all games, it does take a bit of practice, but you'll catch on soon enough. You don't have to be a skateboarding fan to play this game. There are so many levels and goals to reach that you'll soon become a Tony Hawk fan if you aren't already. The music is good, but it does get a bit repetitive. Thankfully you can put your own music on. This game is great for all ages."
2,"Interesting, but ultimately disappointing","Cromer does a wonderful job when he stays on the topic he knows well, how to explain principles in physics. He also does an effective job of skewering postmodernist critics of science. However, the promise of ""connected knowledge"" is not fulfilled. Cromer makes connections the way a shotgun makes marriages. He can't make real connections among knowledge domains because he is ignorant (often arrogantly so) of the knowledge domains outside physics that are important to his thesis. If you are interested in science education, read this book but beware of serious errors in his discussion of human learning, evolution of language and the relation between thought and language, and most surprisingly, in his treatments of statistics."
2,Too high a charge for shipping,"The product was intact. However, I was charged over 14 dollars for shipping that took 4 weeks to arrive. I will not order from this Amazon side company again. The product was intact but that is all I can say positive. The product was over priced and I felt robbed for the price of shipping. Should have been a book rate considering the time it took to receive the product."
2,expensive and slow delivery,Product received from one of Amazon re-salers is in good condition but they charged me FedEx delivery fee of $10 for $18 product and delivered 10 days later. Other product purchased same day were delivered in 2 days and didn't cost as fraction in the delivery charges.I would suggest to Amazon to be very detailed in showing delivery charges when products purchased together are coming from different re-salers and therefore charge multiple delivery fees.I am upset with Amazon failing to do that before I placed my order.
2,Corruption at a High Level,"Corruption at a high level can bring a high price! That is exactly what happens in this fictional novel by Luke Short. He has written about a State Senator who is hungry for power, money, and land, and he will stop at nothing to get what he wants. One of the great tragedies that we see in this book is how the Ute indians are about to lose their land to this money hungry scoundrel. A single cow hand takes on the system and ultimately brings down corruption and restores order in this wild west thriller."
5,Another winner,Both my grandsons (2 1/2 & 3 1/2) love it. The story has a great flow and pace is reasonably fast. Ernie and Bert hold the act together.
3,do you like a little movie with your music video?,"I enjoyed the resolution, acting (even though many first-timers), fun and occasionally informative audio commentary by the director and cute Kirsten Dunst, frequent realism of the story and locations, deleted scenes, featurette, and language options. On the other hand, I was barely into this movie until about the last third. The ugly, sloppy look and action, Kirsten wasted and Jay Hernandez expressionless, blue tint, uncompelling storyline, but most of all the gratuitous songs (I counted 30 in the credits). I may be in the minority, but I find overuse of songs in many recent movies to often be evidence of weak storyline, and not at all profound, despite the bragging in director commentaries (others much worse than with this movie, e.g., Me, Myself & Irene). The first part of the movie ranks 2-3 stars, but I'd give it 3.5 overall."
2,Not a beautiful movie.,"I didn't care for Crazy/Beautiful with Kirsten Dunst and Jay Hernandez, totally over-rated and there was no passion, just two teens all over eachother. Dunst is not a spectacular actress like everyone thinks she is, she's not sexy whatsoever, she tries really hard to be in this film, flashing her navel and parading around in her underwear. Hernandez on the other and is a cutiepie and an ok actor. Dunst's character Nicole is mentally-disturbed and her love for Carlos is threatened when her dad (Bruce Davidson) tries to end their relationship. He is from the wrong side of the tracks, just the same old, boring formula used in practically every film. Nothing engaging here, I'd pass on this teen drama."
4,NICOLE / CARLOS : A LOVE STORY,"John Stockwell's CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL describes a conformist love story in an environment that doesn't react the way it should react. In a mainstream movie, the Mexican parents of Carlos Nuñez would have cherished Nicole Oatley with the usual Latin warmth and Nicole's family would have rejected Carlos because of his social and race background. Congressman Tom Oakley, even if he's a member of the Democrat party, wouldn't have accepted that his daughter sees the son of a chicano. Thanks to the unusual handling of this love story, in addition to the exceptional performance of Kirsten Dunst, CRAZY/BEAUTIFUL deserves to appear in your rental list.A DVD zone Mamas and Papas."
3,"good, but somewhat unrealistic","i just saw this movie on the oxygen network...well written, well acted, and i have to give props to the director for accurately portraying the east la culture, but one thing kept nagging me....why in the world would this handsome, intelligent young man who had so much going for him be attracted to this unattractive, drugged-up looking, needy LOSER of a character. It just didn't make any sense to me. I cannot see this happening in real life."
1,"Beyond Tears :Living After Losing a Child, Revised Edition","I have read several books since I just lost my son a few months ago, I was very disappointed in this book, for several reasons, it gives no hope or inspiration, it is very depressing, parents that lose a child, especially their only child, do not believe ""misery loves company"", if you are searching for any kind of peace, hope and inspiration, this book is not the one to read."
4,Krumkake Express Iron,Would highly recommend this iron. Used it to make traditional Krumkake at Christmastime. Was so much easier than the old irons made over the stove.
2,FELLINI'S LAST FILM,"LA VOCE DELLA LUNA is Fellini's last film and alledgely his worst one. That's surely due to the presence of the obnoxious Mr. Roberto Benigni who can damage anything he touches. Fellini is in my opinion the greatest film maker of all-time and his work is practically composed only of masterpieces, among them the greatest film ever made, OTTO E MEZZO (EIGHT AND A HALF).I only bought La Voce della Luna because it was the only one I had not in my collection up till now."
3,Neil Diamond,"I've been a Diamond fan for years, and have had this movie for a long time. Bought another copy for a friend last Christmas, since she is a fan, as well.Being a fan, I tend to like the movie, tho I know it received mixed reviews when it was first released."
1,Luci Arnaz- remove this from your resume,"Ugh. Poor plot development and cardboard characters. For example, he loves his wife sooooo much and discards her sooooo easily? Not likely. Lucie Arnaz, a wonderful personality and normally ""good"" actress is a cartoon character. Who could fall in love with Neil Diamond with all his angst and schmaltzy whining? Not I, that's for sure."
5,Movie 5 stars - DVD transfer quality 0 stars,"The Jazz Singer movie starring Neil Diamond has always been one of my favorites and deserves 5 stars, however the transfer quality to DVD is awful with extremely grainy resolution. You would think that the studio would use today's technology and release a decent copy."
4,The Jazz Singer as entertainment,"This is a pretty good movie. It's dated now but the subject matter carries over well. Neil Diamond isn't awful as an actor but he doesn't shine either.The story is a little hokey but it was updated from a movie from the 30's or 40's and they updated it fairly well.I'm easily entertained and I wax nostolgic for the movies I saw when I was younger, but I still enjoyed this one, one more time."
2,A typical vanity picture,"It's been the rare music superstar who doesn't turn their hand to at least one movie, and Neil Diamond is no exception. ""The Jazz Singer"" is not a good film, either cinematically (Sir Laurence Olivier stated flat out that he did this one for the money) or musically (""Hello Again"" is pretty, but much of the rest of the soundtrack tries WAY too hard). Diamond has a deer-caught-in-the-headlights expression for much of the movie, except when he's singing. Olivier's over-the-top performance is a treat for cheese lovers, though, and Lucie Arnaz actually does a pretty good job. Overall, though, if you're not a Neil Diamond fan (and even if you are), this film is pretty tough going."
5,Love this movie!!!,"Exactly what was described is exactly what I received! Arrived on time, perfect condition, would recommend this to all!! In 1981 when the movie was first released, a friend asked me to watch it with him. When I learned that Lucie Arnez was in this, I was turned off, never cared for her but I agreed to give it a try. Am I very glad that I did!! I ADORED her in this movie and NEIL, WOW!! Good storyline, good music and good old fashioned romance!! Very happy to include this into my collection!! Be careful what region is offered on any video; for the first time I ordered a copy, not realizing the region, the DVD would not play on my player, was wondering why it was so inexpensive, but this copy, 25th anniversary is worth the money, and it has the correct region to be watched in the United States.!!!"
1,Comp-U-Pare does not work,"The software would be about okay as Guitar tutor software but it does not include any well known songs to learn (unlike some other packages like eMedia's Rock Guitar which I prefer). Also, the Comp-U-Pare feature - the main reason I bought the software - does not work and actually crashes the software. There is a support website but it is terrible with lots of broken links on the website (that are supposed to go to pages on the website that are no longer at the given URL rather than linking to missing external pages). In particular, there is a dead link that is supposed to download an upgrade."
3,Not bad,"His first solo effort after the Rascals' split. Not a bad effort, but not one of his best recording sessions."
1,Not Feelin It...,"I'm sorry, but this CD is a joke. I watched the tribute in disbelief when it aired and was truly taken aback. I felt that most of the performers butcherd Selena's songs, The re-inacments were not of Selena's style, and most of the people who sang her songs were not sincere at all. It was a big dissapoitment for me, being a Selena fan. The only few people who I thought were at least decent was Gloria Estefan and the young Puerto Rican who sang ""No Debes Jugar."" I must say, I do question the vocal abilities of some of the females who sang; Ana Barbara, Thalia...But I am not writing this review to bash anyone, I'm writing to give my opinion of this albume. Personally, I wouldn't buy it becuase for me it's not a very good representation of what Selena/Tejano is. If you want a good Selena cd, I reccomend 'Selena Ones'(cd & dvd)-which has 20 tracks of her biggest hits and 13 of her music videos."
3,Selena iVIVE!,"Well, I personally atended the Tribute Concert. It was amazing, you could feel the energy. I think that most of the artists weren't at their best but, then again the artists were supposed to do their own thing with the songs and put their own touch to Selena's songs; that was kind of the purpose of the concert. The CD was the only dissappointment I had, because it did not contain all the artists like: Pepe Aguilar, Ana Barbara, Banda El Recodo, Montez de Durango, Bobby Pulido, Jay Perez, Olga Tañon, Paulina Rubío, The Kumbia Kings, or the Finally Remake of Como La Flor. I think that Paulina's version of Fotos y Recuerdos was the best. This cd is just a fraction of the show and they are recorded in the studio so they sound way better then what they did live."
4,"Sanyo SK-75 Space Saving Toasty Oven, Silver","This is my third Toasty. Yes, it is not perfect, but I really think it is great. After setting a tortilla on fire and my toaster, which in flames I threw out on my deck, I knew I needed something I could see visually to what was happening. After the first purchase I then bought one for my sister for her Birthday and then recently one for my other sister. If you are doing big jobs this may not be for you, but for a single or double user it works out very well for toasting and broiling small portions."
4,Works great. simple to operate,Works great. simple to operate. Just what I needed for my contemporary kitchen. Small but efficient.
3,"OK, but slow","I like the size of this toaster oven--it does not take up much counter space. I dislike the slowness of this item for making toast--takes more than twice as long to toast bread as my old toaster did. Also, it is not really a toaster ""oven"", as it does not have oven temperatures for baking. It seems to be designed mainly for toasting or heating things up."
4,perfect,"bought this item for my boyfriend because his apartment is small and he needed a toaster oven. we've only used it less than a handful of times to make toast and warm up waffles, and it seems to be doing exactly what its made for. can fit a decent size bagel on each rack. looking forward to using it more and was a good choice"
5,Sanyo Toasty Oven,"Sanyo SK-7S Space Saving Toasty Oven, SilverI made this purchase on looks alone and because the Toasty Oven takes up so little counter space. This toaster oven is perfect for my small kitchen. I love the way it works and especially because you can use the top, middle and bottom shelves independently."
5,It does what it is supposed to do!,"I have purchased 6 Sanyo Space Saving Toaster Ovens -four toasters for other people that made a point of saying they wished they had one. I like the even toasting, they abiity to make open-face sandwiches, and the ability to toast or heat food with a variety of thicknesses. I own two toasters - one in a vacation rental in Fl and have had several people ask ""where they can I get THAT TOASTER"". I wish it came in more colors."
5,Sanyo SK-75 Toaster,"Great toaster, makes bagels just like the bagel shops (crisp on the inside and soft on the outside-assuming you cut the bagel in half of course). Easy to make toast, however, it can only do two large pieces of bread at once, one on each rack. I had to put felt pads under the feet since the feet material made little black marks on my white corian type countertop. Easy to clean crumb catcher - just empty it a lot since it is a simple small pull out tray. DON'T try to take out the racks to put in the dishwasher like the pamphlet says is possible - or your toaster is toasted. We like ours a lot and it is well constructed and doors and racks glide in and out effortlessly. I may buy a couple more for my daughters to use too."
5,History of the desendants of Nicholas Beery,I have two copies. Geil and Wenger descendants included due to cross marriages between 3 families over centuries. Good job of putting data together. Would consider trading one for the Geil book.
1,Where's Jackie??,"I respectfully must disagree with other reviewers.Where on earth is Jackie?The first book in this series was good, a great many chuckles and the desire to read the next one. The second, with the introduction of Jackie was great. The third with the continuation of Jackie was terrific. I so looked forward to the fourth with more Jackie.What a disappointment!! This was a very flat book. Come on, Maddy. Jackie absolutely made the stories she was in. Don't leave her out again. She is the best character you have."
1,what a horrible toy!,"My son who is 6 years old was so exciting to get this toy for christmas, but it took my 18 year old son and myself FOREVER to put the blasted thing together and the slightest movement would knock it down. It was very unstable, had a million pieces and left my 6 year old frustrated. I will NEVER buy another imaginext toy ever again!!"
5,HOURS OF FUN,"My son got this toy for his 5th birthday and absolutely loves it!!! The first day, he played for six hours straight. He loves all of the extra little fun things that Fisher Price thought of...the trap door, the shooting water that knocks the fire over, the siren, the hook, etc. It didn't take him long to figure out how to put the pieces together. It is like a new toy every time he plays with it. He also got the introduction package for the castle imaginext toy. I love that all of the pieces are interchangeable we can expand. I also like the fact that it is a big toy that can be broken down easily for storage. He is a big Rescue Hero fan and I think that this is a great way to extend his imagination."
5,Great playset to foster imagination!,"We bought the fire rescue set for my son's 4th birthday. It is a wonderful toy. It is very durable, limitless set-up options and great for the imagination. He interchanges characters from other sets and has a whole Jack Stone, Playmobile, Imaginext story going on. He's also used the firehouse as Wayne Manor and the Batcave. Yes, he has quite an imagination. It is truly a great toy and we will buy the police station and other accessories for Christmas. Thanks Fisher-Price for another great toy!"
4,My 5 y/o loves the rescue center!,"MY son got this for Christmas, the day before his 5th birthday. He really loves playing with it nad making different designs. The very first time he needed help getting it together as there are alot of pieces but every since he has been building things on his own. He gives the toy two thumbs up! We are very happy with the toy. It does not stay together when moved around, as it isn't ""suppose"" to, it is designed to take apart so your imagination can work!"
4,A fine carafe,"Ah, what a splendiferous carafe. The only problem is that when your wife catches the iron cord on the handle and yanks it off the counter, it breaks into many many pieces, necessitating replacement. Perhaps next time around Braun can attach the base of the handle to the carafe itself, making such accidents less likely."
3,a unique read,"I found that this book had an interesting premise that is relevant to our lives today, but was not backed up by information that was particularly well thought out. They too often used examples that referred to television, which is not a particularly credible source to have used for this subject. They also repeated many of their main ideas over and over again which became quite monotonous and the obvious bias that they wrote this book with was hard to overlook. This book had an overall good premise but fell short in the execution. So, unless you are really willing to weed through this book, I would suggest finding an author that has more to say abou this subject."
5,Maw-Maw's right choice,My grandson's birthday was in June and I purchased this for him. He turned one. He just loves playing with this as well as his 3 yr old cousin. He opens the door and sits there and laughs. The lights and sounds are great. It's extreamly durable and educational. The pictures and write up does not do it justice. I would highly recommend this toy.
5,So much fun!,"My husband and I bought this for our daughter once I had read all the positive reviews and watched the demonstration. We put it together for her one year birthday party. Kids (boys as well as girls) played with it continuously - all the way up to age nine. Our daughter plays with it more than the rest of her toys now. My only complaint is the ""roof/door"" part is not very sturdy. When she stands up and pulls on it, which any child will do, it is a bit wobbly. Of course, she's never unattended so it won't be a problem that outweighs her sheer enjoyment of the toy. I know of five mom's that were at her birthday party that went out to purchase it for their children (if only I could receive a commission)!"
3,Battery life short,"I bought this toy for my daughter after reading the wonderful reviews. While both my children love this toy when the batteries are working, they only last in ours for a few days. The kids don't like it near as much when the batteries don't work, but it would cost a fortune to keep it working. I think there is something wrong with ours as I don't see anyone else having this problem."
5,Worth every penny,I bought this when my son was just learning to crawl. He is now running all over the place and still plays with this toy more than anything. There is so much for him to do and he never gets tired of it. I would highly recommend this toy.
1,We are on our 4th one!!!,"We have had 4 Fisher Price Laugh and Learn Homes. The first one had a broken circuit board, the 2nd died and completely quit working in 3 months, and the third (replacement from FP) does not make the correct sounds when y0ou push the doorbell and the light does not work. This toy was a lot of fun when it worked, but lately it has just been a huge hassle."
4,Nice varriedn toy,"We took this out of the box when our baby was 6month and she immediately like it, she is now 1 year old and keeps finding new things to do.there are some annoying features in it, like the key to the door cannot stay in and does not do much, so she cannot really use it. The music is nice and the best feature is turning on the light which was the first thing my daughter managed to do with great satisfaction. She still can't put the shapes into their special place, so she still has something to learn..."
1,Cancer Warning,This is a warning for this toy!WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.
5,Hands down the best toy purchase for our third child who is now 19 months,"Wow. I don't go crazy over toddler toys. In fact, after three kids I generally don't notice what my 19 month old is playing with because he tends to play with the older kids toys. By the time I had him I was kind of ""over"" buying baby toys and had given a lot of the toddler toys away. We got this as a gift from a friend when our baby was 6 months and he has been playing with it non-stop since then. First he was able to crawl up and press the buttons. Now he walks through and does all the activiites. There are still activities he will grow into. Our other children ages 6 and 8 have a blast crawling through it with him and using it as a play house. It's big but really worth it. We ended up putting all the pieces to the shape sorter away because he tosses these around the house. Without those pieces there is nothing to clean up and it's 20 toys in one. A real winner. Yea to Fisher Price this time!"
5,What an Amazing Toy!,"My 10 month old received this toy for Christmas! He has played with it every day since, and each day he discovers something new! The music is cute and catchy...my husband and I find ourselves humming it during the day! The volume control is a nice bonus. My 3 year old enjoys playing with it as well. It has been a great toy for encouraging both children to interact and play together. It is big and bulky, but well worth the space it takes up!!! We love this toy!"
5,i should have purchased this home years ago!,"I wanted to purchase this home for my oldest daughter when she was crawling, but resisted temptation. My youngest daughter who is 4 months old , received it as a gift for Christmas. More of a gift to grow into. My oldest daughter who is 2.5 years old has not stopped playing with it. She enjoys singing along to the alphabets, playing with the clock and has countless other games she loves to play. Everyday she is coming up with new ways to play with the home, it has really sparked her imagination! I recommend this to everyone with young children, definitely worth every last penny. I am now thinking about buying the kitchen to go along with it. Thanks Fisher Price for another great product! I wish they would come out with a full enclosed playhouse with the same type of activities."
5,Super Great Buy!!!,"We'd originally bought our daughter the IncrediBlock for her 1st Birthday. We were really disappointed with it - she didn't seem very interested in it, & my husband & I thought it'd be a lot cooler of a toy for $50! So for only $10 more, we exchanged it for this house & our daughter LOVES it! There are SO many things on it to play with! While the IncrediBlock couldn't keep her attention for more than a minute or 2, she'll spend 20 or 30 minutes playing with her house, and she goes back and forth to it all day long!UPDATE (Sep 2011): We've owned this toy for SIX years now & it's still a favorite of our younger children. Even up until around age 5 they've played with it for long amts of time with younger siblings/friends. I would buy this toy again in a heartbeat!!!"
5,Best toy ever!,"I bought his toy for my little man when he was nearly five months old. He really couldn't play with it then, but just sat and stared at it like ""how cool!"". He is now nearly 17 months old and it is still his favorite toy. He loves the songs, the shape sorting, opening and closing the door. It has been the best money we have spent on a toy, along with the Fisher Price Step and Play Piano, which he got at the same time. When his older cousins or the neighbors visit they all want to play with his house. I got this on sale at Toys-R-Us for $55, but it would have been worth $155 and if I had to pay that to replace it I would. We also have the Laugh and Learn phone, toolbench, birdbath, puppy, and chair, all of which are excellent, but the Learning Home rules!"
1,Cancer causing chemicals?,"Was planning to buy this, and saw it had california's proposition 65 warning: WARNING: This product contains chemicals known to the State of California to cause cancer and birth defects or other reproductive harm.No way is this acceptable!"
1,not so lucky,"This duck was a dud at best. I would not recommend it. The wings seperated on the first use and the ""fully charged battery"" barely turned the wings at that.save your $$$ and buy a baby MOJO"
2,Great collection except for one song,"Great collection of classic songs. However, I don't care for Steamroller--yes I know it's a parody but I would just as soon not be reminded of napalm bombs. (Note - I am very picky in my record evaluations, and give a thumbs up--four or five stars--only to albums where I can play the whole record and delight in hearing every single song.)"
5,Beautiful on the Table,"I have two sets of these knives, given as wedding gifts and couldn't be more pleased with them. As beautiful on the table as they are sharp and reliable. The wood is rich and warm, the blade has a wonderful line with the charming Bee at the height of the manche. My husband is French and he says they are "" super magnifiques""! I agree!!"
2,"""laguiole"" steak knives","The finish was atrocious; the handles were finished very irregularly, and the steel of the blades was badly scuffed. The little wooden rays were a joke. The worst part was that I ordered them for a gift, ... I still had to scramble to find a gift."
1,Piece of junk.,"After the first use it smelled like the motor was burning up. After the third use, it quit for good. It was not misused, or overloaded. I learned that lesson the hard way. For the price, you would think that you would get a product that lasted a little longer than 3 weeks!"
1,Did they test this with kids?,"Boy this looked cool! My five-year-old, with construction toys galore really wanted it. He can't put it together. He tries for a while, then calls me in to help. It still takes me 15 minutes to assemble a basic setup as I choke down my frustration. The pieces look like you can assemble them any which way. The first time you assemble the walls and the platform won't snap on top you learn otherwise. You end up putting it together and then taking it apart and trying again. The pieces have a specific way of going together that is not easy to figure out. It looks simple like Lego's, but really it is much more complex. I have to wonder if they did any usability testing. My wife has also observed that the plastic on the vehicles isn't the usual sturdy variety you expect out of FP, but is more brittle like your drug store variety toy. We're sorry we bought it."
1,"Get the sponge out, we're making coffee!","I had owned a Braun coffeemaker earlier but had switched over to Krups and was dissapointed. So I went back to Braun, purchasing the KF510 with a separate gold filter. Overall the design is good, it's a stylish piece. Coffee was decent and hot but what I found really dissapointing was the pause and serve feature. I don't think it works properly and after removing it, the coffee floods seem to have stopped. I'm not sure if I got a bum coffeemaker or what but I've seen mention of this issue in a couple of other reviews... So I guess I'll have to buy another one!(Addendum: The pause/serve feature doesn't always work so the coffee ends up coming out of drainage holes at the top of the filter basket and not out of the drip spout, very messy!)"
5,Very good coffeemaker,"I am very happy with this coffeemaker. I was looking for a no-frills coffeemaker to replace my 13-year-old Braun. This coffeemaker works well and makes very hot coffee. The carafe pours nicely. I have only had it for a month, but have had no problems with it. I would definitely reccommend it."
3,cute!,cutest panda ever!!! but i thought it was going to be a little bigger.. besides that my only complaint is that when i received the packaged.. the packaged was destroyed but good thing is that i still received the little guy.. i would have been sad if the panda wasnt there other than that all i have to say is CUTE PANDA!! :D
2,A little more effort would have gone a long way...,"I buy virtually every video game book that is out there, and this has to be one of the worst ever. The directions given were freuently incorrect (i.e., lefts and rights for getting through mazes were constantly reversed) and on occasion, events were presented out of order. Some maps or diagrams of the puzzles would have been much more welcome than mediocre gray-scale artwork. Honestly, folks, download an online FAQ for help with Beyond the Beyond."
1,Another victem of VTech's poor battery life,"Just wanted to let the others know that the replacement battery is not the cure. This phone dies in minutes after a full 24 hour charge. My wife uses it just as a means to get to one of our other two 900MHZ phones which are great! They are Panasonic and/or Sharp phones. Next phone sale we see, the VTech will be in the trash."
1,same battery problem as others,I have had the exact same experiance with this phone as most of the other reviewers. The only exception that I saw was that I actually did replace the battery and it didn't help. I am looking for a new phone now to replace it. Buyer beware.
2,Hard to hear people,"I bought this phone about three weeks ago, the first thing I dislike is that when you answer the phone you hear a beep and so does the caller-its trying to zap every single call which is very annoying. It's hard to hear people-I turned the volume up and it was to loud theres not a good setting for the volume. The caller ID is very hard to read. There has not been a change at all from telemarketers still receiving alot. The only good thing about this phone is the range, although if you are outside not facing the charger the clearity is gone. Would not recommend this phone to anyone."
2,"no, no, no.","i liked ""judgment"" a lot...and allmusic said this is anathema's best. so i bought this cd. bad mistake.quite simply, it's boring.both ""judgment"" and ""alternative 4"" urinate on it from a great height. get them instead."
5,I'm addicted,These are great for fresh breath on the go. Pop one in after that cup of coffee or puff if cigarett or just to fell fresh before an intimate moment. These are the best things ever made for a mouth full of refreshment.
4,Fresh Breath,These are great for when you chewing gum isn't appropriate. They even kick onion breath for a fair amount of time. I like the huge rush of flavor initially as well. It gets the saliva going and wakes up the taste buds.
4,Brews a great cup of coffee!,The Braun 580 is a definite improvement over the coffermaker that came free with my coffee club membership. Easy access to the coffer/filter basket. The water filter removes chlorine from water and really improves the taste of the coffee (they should be replaced every two months). Visible water filter replacement reminder on top of maker is a nice touch.
2,I have 2 but won't get a third,"If luke warm coffee is your thing then this is the maker for you.Well I bought one of these maker and one was given to me.The positives it is easy to program and clean.The negatives, it doesn't brew HOT coffee..I have tried everything to make it work better thinking is was not clean enough but no it just doesn't brew hot enough Therefore it doesn't extract the best flavor from the coffee beans .I am done with this one and need to find a coffeemaker that brews HOT COFFEE any suggestions.?????"
3,Not that great!,"I bought it cos a lot of reviews stated that it produced good hot coffee, but I must say that I was disappointed. It does seem to have a higher power rating than most regular coffee makers and I thought it would brew hotter coffee, but it didn't. Maybe mine is just a defective unit?? Unlikely. I will test it at some point with a thermometer.Secondly, the drip releasing hot water over the coffee is just one hole. I don't get it. Why did they do that? That leaves the coffee on the sides untouched, cos it mainly drips through the center. Rather stupid if you ask me. I'm going to see if there's some way I can mod it to spread the hot water a bit more."
3,Long but narrow.,"The purpose of this work is to relate Revelation to the literary background of the Classical world. Apparently, in order to have room to do this most thoroughly, virtually all other topics are excluded. There is no discussion of canonicity, history of interpretation, or exposition. Even so, the author often piles on so much information, that it is sometimes hard to follow his argument.Unlike most of the other books in the Word Biblical Commentary series, this treatment in entirely secular in approach. If you are looking for spiritual guidance, you had better look to the works of Boring or Mounce, depending on your theological bent"
3,Milwaukee,"I use this all the time and it works great. The battery life I wish was better ( last longer and more powerfull) but it does what I need it to do which is mostly cut where there is no outlet close by or I dont want to break out the large circular saw and cords.Not hugely powerfull, so you can sieze it up if you push it but just give it time to get through the material and it will cut it."
3,bad regulator,"I purchased This Camco 4100 grill from amazon - I mounted it to my motorhome and when I tested it I dicovered the regulator control valve is defective. I guess i'm stuck buying a new one for another $20.00 as I don't know where to address this issue and the valve is stamped china, and has a unique fitting configuration."
4,Olympian grill,I like everything about the grill except it will only fit 2-3 t-bone steaks at one time. It would be a great grill for a family of two.
2,well designed but needs more care with packaging,"This grill arrived with a crack on the cover. Damage during shipment is not the fault of the manufacturer, so IMO Amazon could have boxed it more protectively.I advise all buyers to save all packaging until they know the product they have purchased is satisfactory."
3,decent at best,well let me get out of the way and say that the graphics are really good...and now on to the bad..u have to set your settings every game..for some reason it wont let u save them..so that gets pretty annoying really quick...offesive rebounding is out of control..they get about 3 offensive rebounds per set and they make it on their fourth try..the game for me seems to be slow paced..plus they dont have some players..im from chicago and they dont even have Tyson Chandler or Eddie Curry..i mean whats that about..
2,Too Slow for fast paced X-Box,"I am an EA Sports devotee from the beginning of EA. But, this dated title needs to be grought into the new millenium. Graphics are ok, but action is sloooow. Playability is fair, A1 is predictable. I would pass."
2,Disappointing,"I was very disappointed by this game considering the PC-based NBA Live series is so much fun. The players move very stiffly, and their other movements for things like blocking shots and playing defense looks very artificial and unrealistic. Also, the system for storing stats in season mode is woefully inadequate. Every player on the active roster is charged for a game played regardless of whether that player actually plays. On offense, a simple ball fake will almost always get the oposing player in the air, allowing your player in for an easy dunk. But even then the movements are very stiff. I was hoping that the more powerful processor on the Xbox would increase the excitement of the EA Sports line, but NBA Live 2002 crashes the boards like a skinny two guard. I wouldn't say avoid the game, but just make sure you know what you're getting and that you can live with it."
1,Horrid Game!!!,"I'm very happy with my Xbox console, but this was the most horrid game I've played for it. The gameplay was terribly glitchy, and the graphics were not smooth either. I'm a HUGE fan of EA Sports games, and I thought Madden 2002 was the best on the Xbox to date.If you're looking for a good basketball game, you may want to hold out for a bit. I know I'm the only negative one about this, but I strongly suggest that you rent this one before you buy it.On the other hand, I will hope NBA 2K2 will serve justice to the Xbox. If not, I'll just wait till next year."
2,Disappointing,"This game was a nice attepmt, but fails to satisfy. It's nearly impossible to rebound the ball and anything that's not a dunk doesn't go in. Even All-Stars like Chris Webber and Kobe Bryant miss just about everything unless they're right under the basket. Also, try stealing the ball without fouling someone. You have no choice but to let the other team take it to the basket and hope they miss."
1,Cheap simulation,"This is not a Lagioule, and to call it that besmirches the fine name. I have bought Lagioule knives and corkscrews in France, so I bought this expecting the same quality. The workmanship is terrible, and it's sad and cheap. I sent it back. Don't waste your money, buy an authentic Lagioule."
1,what is this??,"way to go microsoft!! make yet another game that no one will buy. All these no name games are worthless. they just think of something slap it on a disc and sell it. Xbox needs better titles, and more interesting games. the only one that impresses me is wwf raw is war. i still only give that a 3 out of 5 rating. don't buy an xbox. Save your well earned money for something better."
2,Rent it.,"For the first couple days, this seemed like the best game in the world. Once the initial thrill is gone, however, it just gets terribly monotonous. There are several game-play modes, but ""battle"" is the only one you'll ever play. (Yes it is, don't argue!) Seriously, straight racing you can do on ANY car game, this one's selling point is the characters' interaction with eachother. You'll be cracking up when you hear the one-liners being passed around...untill you notice they're the same 2 over and over, and then that little green ""MUTE"" word your TV puts in the corner gets irritating.One thing I will defend on this game is the cartoon-cel graphics. People complain that the XBOX version could've been more realistic. It's SUPPOSED to be a cartoon, people!"
3,If only it stayed square...,"Ok, I'm still going to say this is my favorite square because unlike my other squares, after I tinker with it, it is actually square.BUT, the problem is it doesn't hold square for long. I'm finding that I have to pull out my little hex wrench before I begin working each day. Finally today I looked and realized that the adjustment head was notching out the inside of where it should be stopping the angle. Do I pull too hard? Maybe, but I don't always have the time and patience to gently inch the arm out until it touches to stop. I'm thinking even that method might end up notching this somewhat thin aluminum.Another complaint is that I keep having to flip it over because a screw sticks out on one particular side. I don't know why but it seems that that is the side I want to measure from each time."
4,Good introductional pack to Spanish language,"I got my 3 year old the Kinderbot Robot for Christmas last year. We have had a blast playing with it. It comes with a standard cartridge that has lots of games and activities. I also bought the Spanish cartridge since my native language is Spanish and my son is bilingual. I thought it would help me teach him new words. I think this is a good option for parents who want to give their kids an introduction to Spanish. It is entertaining and it repeats the words in Spanish and then in English (there is pictures of every item too), giving kids a clear understanding of each word taught. The games it contains are fun and entertaining. However, the Spanish is from Spain (I'm from Mexico) so some of the vocabulary is only used in Spain. The pronunciation is good but with a slight American accent."
3,funny if not taken seriously,"This is definitely one of those movies you watch at about midnight when you'ree exceedingly bored and die of laughter. if you don't like slapstick comedy or are looking for any kind of plot, find something else. But if you want something utterly pointless just for the fun of it, this can be very entertaining."
5,Great coffee,"I've has the KF580 model for 6 months and it is great. The coffee is not ""weak"" or ""not hot enough"" as some have stated. I previously owned a Braun and it was also good but this one is much better. It is so easy to clean and take apart. I am baffled by the person that said their model had a ""ticking"" sound? I've had nothing but perfect coffee since I've been using this thing. Best looking maker I've ever seen."
4,"Good, basic coffeemaker","For those who want just a simple coffeemaker that makes a decent cup of coffee, this is a hard product to pass by. The water filtration device is nice, but not necessary in my household, as I already have a filtration system installed, but a nice option anyways.The coffeemaker has a nice, reusable, easy-to-clean filter that I've had no problems with, and it brews in a reasonable amount of time. The only change I'd make to it is add a timer!"
2,Stupid clicking timer,"Got my coffee maker that I spent $70 and brewed my first cup of coffee and heard a loud clicking sound. It was the timer clicking very loudly. Good coffee, but the timer is stupid. Don't waste you money on this one."
3,Auto-Shut Off Malfunctioned,"I bought a Braun KF550-BK AromaDeluxe on Sept. 7, 2004 from Amazon. I like the coffee maker overall; It consistently made good coffee, but now the auto-shut off is malfunctioning. It does not shut off. Instead, when it is time to shut off, the coffee maker keeps trying to shut off with a repeated clicking sound. I actually do not mind this because I used to dislike the fact that it shut off too soon after the coffee is made and I had to turn it back on to re-warm the coffee. Now it acts like an alarm. Yet, it really should not have malfunctioned.I suggest you look at the Stainless Steel Braun Impressions version. Looks far better and the stainless steel carafe will keep the coffee warmer longer. The price difference is trivial."
1,S>D>Gamer,"Can't get it to find any online gameshark codes even when they are listed in gameshark data bank,so cannot load codes intogameport data bank.Isn't this why I bought it???????I also get a USB connect error,altho all my other connections work fine.I would say it is money wasted on JUNK"
1,version 2.0 or higher for used SharkPorts only,"If you go for a used Sharkport, make sure it is 2.0 or higher. If it's used and does not say, then its version 1.x. They are likely selling it because only 2.0 works on PS2s from 2001 or later. I looked at 90% of all serch results for sharkport on the web today, July 4... has some anecdotal good info only. About 1/5 of the posts are significant hardware/software problems. No database anywhere yet of which SP software versions work with which computers or which PS2s. No basicly good FAQ anywhere yet. Existing one covers about 1/4 to 1/3 of problems posted. Will try to write one."
5,steady and beneficial,"This video has just the right pace for all levels. It is not boring or repetitive, and I have found it to be extremely beneficial in weight maintenance and is aerobically sound. I have been doing this video for over five years for at least 5 nights a week."
3,If you don't own a DVD player yet..I guess your stuck with stuff like this!,"Woah, holy cheesy outfits and music! ""You can take this move to the club!""...Jane, not even in 1985 could I take ANY of these moves out in the club. Jane is wearing the most uncomfortable looking lace bodysuit I've ever seen..and with the black cinch belt, she looks somewhat like an oversized peanut shell. She's also wearing what looks like little elf booties. It's a horrible outfit to look at. That being said, she is in great shape..very lean for sure. The whole routine is 60 minutes long and you will sweat if you do the high impact version. That is..if you can get through the dated, dated, dated, and more dated routine, music, and hairdos."
3,Unreliable taste and yield,"The machine is okay for small batches, but if you make a full pot the grounds don't get nearly saturated enough. The quick brew system shoots the water through in a concentrated stream and on full pots, much of the grounds remain physically dry. The coffee is weak. Also, the meter on the side is completely unreliable. I fill it to 5, and it puts 3 cups in the carafe. I fill it 4 and yields 4. Then I fill it to 4 and it yields 2.5. It is totally and completely unreliable.Only the bargain price kept this machine from getting a worse rating. I am a Braun fan and had great sucess with my last machine, but I should have went for a better model. I wouldn't recommend this machine."
2,ok coffeemaker but overpriced,"I like cone-type coffee makers. Braun was always the way to go. I tried to find them in ""brick-and-mortar"" stores and I could not find any! So I look online, and there's only 2 choices: The old units (plastic) sold online and overpriced, or the new units on the Braun website (stainless steel and outrageously expensive). I went this direction but I have to say a plastic coffee maker should NOT cost this much!"
4,Liked it,I needed a new coffee maker quick. It was the right size and works well. It frequently drips while pouring and the water level is hard to see through the blue plastic.
4,The Long Ships - Novel,This was a long read but I found it interesting as it gave some feeling of the Viking years. At times it was a bit corny but overall it was enjoyable.
4,vikings at home,A quick read of historical fiction. A look at the life of the vikings that not all blood and guts.
4,Translating O'Brian,"Fans of nautical novelist Patrick O'Brian will find this lexicon invaluable to decipher all the nautical expressions. There are twenty of the Aubrey-Maturian sagas set in early 19th century British Navy. If you don't know the difference in a ""drowned baby"" and a ""spotted dog"" then you need help with the Sea of Words."
5,5 stars,"My laptop charger had stopped working and I was going to be home on medical leave, I purchased the charger, and wasthinking the shipping was going to be a long wait. I got home after surgery and my charger was already home.Works perfectly, and very good condition, just like the one I had when I first purchased my laptop.Thank you ^_^"
2,Interferes with TV,Generates strong interference with our TV which runs off a rooftop antenna with signal amplifier. Works OK otherwise. The original Dell adapter does not cause interference.
5,I THINK IT'S GREAT!!!!,I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY PEOPLE ARE PUTTING THIS BOOK DOWN. SHE COULD OF SAID BAD THINGS ABOUT THE GUYS LIKE SAMANTHA STONEBREAKER. BUT SHE DIDN'T. SHE HAD ONLY NICE THINGS TO SAY. I LIKE IT AND I DON'T THINK SHE IS A SELL OUT. I THINK SHE WAS JUST PROUD TO BE A PART OF HIS LIFE.
5,LOVED IT!,"I won my own personal copy of Marisa's well written book, and I have to say, I enjoy the book! It is written in a very tasteful matter and the pictures are awesome. I don't think Marisa could have done a better job with it! It's terrific!"
5,Its great and shows alot how it would be to be his girlfrien,"I loved it, Marisa if you get anyway to read this you did a great job writing it and putting it together I just bought it tonight and I read it already I love all the pictures there cute,adorable & funny. I kept seeing a number repeted I think it was 145 or somthing does that have to do with like a personal relationship between you? Well I love the book and its great thanks for writing it! Love susy S."
4,"Great, if flawed, album","Carol C.'s voice sounds eerily similar to Esthero at certain points on this album. The similarities are brief however as Carol's unique vocal signature makes itself known on tracks like The Rain, Bizocho Amargo and Aire.Other tracks such as Beyond Outside and others are forgettable.Overall jazzy, sexy, smooth and intelligent this album definitely deserves a place in your music collection."
3,Make good espresso. Bad instructions & bad frother location,"I own this machine for a few weeks only. While this machine does make pretty good espresso considering it's a fairly small machine and only cost [$$$]. However, AMAZON DOES NOT SHOW THE CORRECT PICTURE FOR THIS MACHINE. I purchase the black model because the frother looks to be in a better location, the extended tubing would work much better than the white model shown. Unfortunatelly, I received a black one with the design of the while machine on this website. It's hard to sink the whole frother in milk with such a limited area. I then thought maybe the frother can be extended. After checking the totally unhelpful manual, I figured there must be a slightly different model. All in all, it is powerful little machine with good function. But make sure you know what you are getting."
3,Disappointed with Amazon,"For a second time in a row, I received items from Amazon that have been pre-used. This expresso machine came with water dripping all over and smells a little moldy, and I cannot trust this machine to work properly. This is probably the last time I am shopping at Amazon for anything other than books, because they do not seem to have their act together. I hate to say this because they have good customer service and easy return policies but lousy order filling."
3,better game in 99,This game was better in 99. The only improvement in this game is the graphics and a few options. The gameplay has actually been tweaked in a negative way and the camera angles are terrible. EA has tried to make this game a little too pretty and not true to the gaming style of their other titles. I would not recommend this game and just to stay with some of the older titles if you want good gameplay.
4,"A good game, but not as fun as SEGA's NHL series","Though SEGA's NHL 2K3 will not be available on XBOX until late 2002/early 2003, I think it may be worth waiting for. SEGA's NHL 2K2 for Dreamcast easily bested EA's NHL 2002 in terms of gameplay. EA's game is not as fluid or intense as SEGA's effort, and I would go with a wait-and-see attitude unless you are dieing for an XBOX hockey title today. Somewhat recommended - A good game, but you'd be better off waiting for SEGA's NHL 2K3 to surface on XBOX."
3,Average game ever,"I played this game one weekend expecting the greatest show on earth, and what do i get nothing. Graphics are horrible compared to any Xbox game, ""besides nbalive2002"" and for all you morons saying nfl fever has great graphics, what are you talking about they are terrible, the stadiums are all wrong, they dont look real, and the jerseys dont do those things in real life. But back to the hockey game, and another disappointment in my eyes, also there is no reason that video games for any of the new systems cant be fantastic, they keep rushing games out there without perfecting one great one, you just have a whole bunch of mediocre ones. This is just my opinion about this game and just about all xbox, cube, ps2 games."
2,rowenta TO-918 A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT,"So disappointed with this toaster and I did my homework! Listened to reviews etc. but it toasts unevenly, many times burning on one side. A couple features are nice like being able to reach the toast, being able to retoast one side with the bagel setting. But over all every cheap toaster I've owned worked better, and I wasn't so happy with them!"
3,Good read - but took liberties with Biblical text,"I was in the check-out line at the library yesterday when this book caught my eye. It is a fictional account of the relationship between Mary and Joseph, from their initial meeting to his death. Elizabeth Berg has certainly taken liberties with the gospel accounts, as all who seek to enlarge the story of the Holy Family must do.Catholics might be offended at the sexual relationship between Mary and Joseph after Jesus was born. In this novel, they go on to have several other children.But other than that, I think that most readers will find this to be a very readable take on their private lives, which no doubt were thrown into turmoil by the announcement of Jesus' birth. Berg delves into Joseph's doubt and his willingness to take Mary as his wife in spite of it. She describes Mary as a free-spirited young teen who feels called to great things. Overall, her portrayal of Mary and Joseph leaves one feeling as if it might have been this way."
1,A REAL DISAPPOINTMENT,"I really wanted to like this book. As an Elizabeth Berg fan, when I discovered that Berg - a poetic writer of women's fiction - actually wrote a book set in Nazareth about the birth of Jesus Christ, I eagerly ordered a copy. Although Berg admits she took liberties with the story of Jesus' birth, and she clearly was trying to portray Mary and Joseph as three dimensional, I found both her writing style and character development quite shallow here. Also, she took Mary and Jospeh places I simply didn't want to go (i.e., I cringed while reading about 16 year old Joseph masturbating, and found myself repelled by the description of 13 year old Mary as filled with sexually yearning). If it's a unique bible story you're looking for, check out Anne Rice's ""Christ the Lord - Out of Egypt"" instead."
1,Completely Pathetic and Not Funny At All,"This movie is a waste of time. While browsing for selections for my weekly video night, I came across this early 70's ""classic"". I got it and thought might be ok, because it was supposed to be more comedic than western. It wasn't.It was horrible. Terence Hill gives a mild performance as Trinity, but otherwise all this movie is a bunch of faux violence between Trinity, his brother and the marauding Mexicans."
1,They Call Me Trinity,"Great movie, extremely poor quality of conversion between film and DVD. Video quality appears overexposed, washed-out. Audio is also very poor. Claims to be Dolby, but it's mono. Claims to be widescreen, but it's not. The VHS version has a much better color resolution. Sad."
5,Three year old's favorite gift,"The supplier was great and the product is great. Great gift to spark a little one's imagination. Every time she plays with the village, she plays a different scenario. I bought this for a three year old but her six year old sister plays together with her and there is no limit to their imagination as to what happens in this village. I also bought the Fisher Price airport and combined with this, they play for hours!"
1,Motorola Slim Battery Review,I ordered two of the Motorola Slim batteries and have not been happy.Neither battery is holding a charge for more than 5 minutes.
2,What Do You Do with A Tale Like This?,I bought the Kindle version. My grandchildren ages 3-11 years old did not like the book. Maybe it just doesn't work in the Kindle format.
5,Two thumbs up!,"It's a favorite of my 3 and 4-year old boys. Beautiful illustrations and a great guessing game with interesting facts to follow about creatures, their tails, ears, mouths and feet. I learning experience for parents too. Highly recommended!"
3,this was an all right book,"I sort of liked this book but the was not enough detail , like win they when there first game you don't know how much they won by.when a line backer backer breaks luke's leg which wasn't good because the story went down hill from there.conflict was one of the most vivid because they were trying to win state chapion, climax was when they won three games in a row and they thought they were the best team in that state"
5,Not Enough of a Good Thing,"This CD is so beautiful. The music and her voice is very soulful. I like what Ms. Baca has done to the Bjork's piece ""Anchor Song"". ""Autumn Leaves"" is exquisite. There are various influences in this CD but Susana Baca has made this her own. Because this CD was recorded during the week of 9/11, it takes on an extra poignancy that cannot be avoided. Go buy this CD at once. Open your hearts and listen."
5,One of the Best Ever,"This barebones recording highlights the most simple, basic emotions of love and loss that we hold on to through the complexities of life....Although Mitchell uses the most beautiful of metaphors to express herself there is never any doubt of her meaning, one of the talents many musicians have trouble really grasping. Musically, the melodies are sometimes as catchy as a pop song, sometimes as sweeping as an aria...and all convay the heartfelt emotions of love that make us feel like we can say, ""yeah, I've been there"". A classic and of all the Mitchell I've listened to so far, her best."
5,"""Blue"" grounds me like nothing else","There is nothing like ""Blue"" to feel centered, grounded and empowered as a woman...all at the same time. Not empowered in the ""feminist"" sense of the word, but in touch with your power as a woman in a man's world, and feeling okay where you are at the moment. I don't know what it is about the powerful, mellow tones that Mitchell evokes, but it grounds me like nothing else. This is an old album, and a cherished one. I just bought the CD because I sold my well beloved casette and wanted a more updated format so that I wouldn't have to flip it over to hear all the songs. What an enchanting moment in time it is to push the ""play"" button and feel joined by a kindred spirit, a little less alone in the world, and a lot more at peace with it."
5,New 24-karat gold plated version!!!,"Oh sorry, I don't usually get so worked up (or use so many bloody exclamation points.) It's just that my absolute favorite CD of all time, BLUE, has been re-released on 24-karat gold plate. A more layered sound is only one of the benefits of this kind of CD. Anyone who owns a 24-karat gold plated CD knows what I'm talking about. Anyway, if there's any kind of way to improve this masterpiece, this is it."
3,Blue's clues to a life,"Mellow, introspective, and sparsely orchestrated, Blue features a few B-list tunes (Carey, This Flight Tonight, River) but the rest of the material doesn't disappoint. Joni's voice is pure and angelic throughout, although when she soars into the high notes it sometimes seems forced. Alanis Morissette wouldn't have bothered with her career if she'd given Blue a good listen - Joni was trumping her 25 years earlier."
4,Crazy Taxi with an edge,"On one hand, this is a graphically inferior version of Crazy Taxi. Graphics aside, the game's fluidity and atmosphere are hurt by the fact it takes ages and ages to load each and every scenario, even if it is exactly the same scenario that you've just finished playing.This game does have its advantages over Crazy Taxi, though. For a start, it's more fun: You're actually encouraged to bump and destroy stuff. Then there are the loads of Simpsons characters and Simpsons related scenarios, and although they will ultimately wear out, they are fun.But the one thing that truly gives this game a significant edge over Crazy Taxi is its two player mode: Two rivalling taxi drivers fight it out to win customers, steal customers from one another (there is only one active customer at a time, and two hungry taxi drivers), and ruin as many things on their way as they can to hinder the opponent.The end result is fun, fun, and then more fun."
2,Disappointing,"I have been a simpsons fanatic for the past 5 years and am humiliated by this ...video game. for 1 thing the Simpsons is a great show so it shouldnt have a scummy video game like this one. they must have been on a low budget making the game. Here are 5 good reasons why this game shouldnt have been invented 1. The graphics are bland, their entrances to the car are absurd. (Hans Moleman doing a flip into a car?!) 2. The mission mode is unbelieveably sinchy. 3. They dont even have all of the characters. (No Patty + Selma, no Julius Hibbert, No Lenny + Carl to name a few) 4. The lines get dull + repetitive in 10 minutes and most of the lines are from old simpsons episodes. 5. This is just [an]... imitation of some game i forget the name of........ oh yeah, CRAZY TAXI!!!!!! I rest my case."
3,"This gets my lowest score ever, 7 thumbs up","If you get my headline you'll get this game. If not you haven't a chance.This is a simpsons game first a foremost. Like most other simpsons games, and Star Wars games for the fact, only hardcore fans of the subject will love it. Some people call the voices annoying but i can't hear enough of Homer yelling USA!It gets 3 stars for the following reasons-- The First star goes the fact it's something Simpsons, and everything that has something to do with the simpsons deserves one star.- My second star goes to Homer driving the car that homer made, it's hidden at first but it's the coolest thing since birth of the cool by miles davis.- My third star goes to the shear length at which it tkaes to unlock everything. Whereas in some games you have to actually get good to unlock everything, this game is designed to allow anyone (including Ralph) eventually unlock everything..."
4,nice fitting seat covers,"these seat covers fit nice and tight- a bit of work to get them on, but they don't slip or slide around the way some cheaper polyester/cotton covers do. i drive my car for work so i'm in and out many, many times a day and they've held up well."
2,"Inconsistent, Yet Interesting","SEASON OF THE WITCH (aka JACK'S WIFE aka HUNGRY WIVES) is a story of a bored housewife who finds fascination in the occult. All the while, she has been suffering from strange nightmares that would ultimately result in tragedy.SEASON OF THE WITCH is a rather interesting, yet inconsistent film by George Romero.While the idea of a bored housewife exploring the unknown is a quite novel one, the rest of the film is hampered by a low budget, amateurish acting, slow pacing, & very little shocks. I think Romero is trying to be personal in this film, but fails in some areas. His most personal film is MARTIN, but that's another review. Slow, ponderous, & sometimes comical, SEASON OF THE WITCH is an odd film in the George ROmero filmography. Even die-hard Romero fans would have trouble liking this film."
5,Great Mouthpiece,We had a hard time getting a 5c mouthpiece for our Besson Cornet in a reasonable period of time due to the music company strikes. This mouthpiece was delivered quickly and fit perfectly.
1,I won't pay that much again!,I bought a set and was extremely dissapointed in the lack of class. I found a beautiful set of wine glass charms for [little money] by searching for wine glass charms on the internet. Take the time and shop around!
1,Junk,"Well, this was a freebie with the Reidel glasses which I gave my girlfriend as a Christmas gift. She was at first annoyed I had wasted my money on these, but when I explained that they were free and she could throw them away, she brightened up.A few weeks prior to that, someone at a party put charms on our glasses. They annoyed all of us, so we took them off!"
5,happy with this prudect,this mouse pad works great its not top of the line but it does the job it was made for ...very happy with the quality of this product
4,Good all around mousepad,"It's thick, has decent weight, grips the desk nicely, appears to be durable, and is slightly longer than it is wide. I'm fully satisfied."
4,Great mousepad,I don't know why you would need anything else. Great mousepad for the price. Highly recommended.
5,Great pad,"I bought this to keep in my LAN bag so I don't end up at the next LAN party without a mouse pad as so many people tend to do. It's a great pad for portability and won't take up too big a footprint on the table, making it easier to put people close together. It's your typical fabric top so it'll get dirty after a while but as I am only using this a couple times a year I don't think that will ever be a concern. It's worth using at home too, it's not a giant gamer pad but it'll do the job without the need for a giant desk."
5,Mouse pad for your mau5,Great works fine I just throw it my backpack and take out when needed. Material is nice and smooth and have yet to run into a problem with it.
1,Smells of Chemicals,"The mouse pad smells terrible and after you have been using it, the smell sticks to your hand. I threw it away because the smell did not subside."
4,good pad for the price,"the pad is nothing special, but it works well and it a great choice given the low price."
2,"Yes, the smell is bad. It doesn't wash out.","I gave this mouse pad two stars only because it is an actual mouse pad, and you can use a mouse on it. The smell is horrible, and it does not wash out. I immediately ordered another mouse pad. This is a case where you definitely get what you pay for.I would not recommend this mouse pad to another person even if it was free."
5,Great deal,Nice thick heavy weight mouse pad . I would have bought more if I would have known . Good Stuff
2,"Eh, Not so much","This is an example of ""you get what you pay for"". I find that, for my purposes, this vacuum is only bearly functional. The hose from the vacuum seems a bit short. The capacity of the canister seems rather inadequate. The weight of the canister is such that if you need to reach a higher area, it tips up on its exhaust end. There are few attachments. It does an o.k. job if you don't need much."
2,Don't buy this,I bought this vacuum cleaner based on the great reviews. It does have the suction power but I bought it to use on the stairs and upstairs. I had a tool that would work on the stairs but it doesn't fit on the tube. I'm not sure what this machine is designed to do but the floor/carpet attachment doesn't do a decent job on either. When I use the crevice tool I wear ear plugs because of the noise is deafening.Other raters liked it for picking up cat hair but the hose and extension tubes act as a magnate and collect cat hair. I spend half the time cleaning the machine. Cleaning the filter is no picnic either. You need another vacuum to clean the filter and clean up the mess after the filter is cleaned. There must be better options.
5,"Sloshed, Plastered and absolutely Brilliant","This book is especially meant for those evenings when you are about to go on a binge and know that serious repercussions might exist - and do not even want to avoid them.Bruce Clifton has put together an amazing collection of anecdotes and examples to buttress his exercises. The section where Noah S. Sweat addresses the mississippi house is simply unbeatable.. overall, an enjoyable read.Enjoy it while you're still sober!"
3,Utilitarian,"The photo of it wasn't very good. It's plastic, not the manufacturer's metal as I expected, but it works."
3,OK!!!!!!,"Yes this coffee maker is ONLY ok!!!!!! We have only had this machine a few months. We do use it every day. Two things with this coffee maker, first the carafe spills when you pour, took us a few pots to figure out that you have to lift the lid to pour. Second the door for the filter keeps swinging open mid brew, so finally we had to tape it closed when coffee is dripping. Ridiculous!!!!! I am now looking for a new machine would never buy this brand again, it's a big pain."
5,Yet another great CD from Ronnie McDowell.,Elvis may have gone but Ronnie McDowell keeps his memory alive with some of the Kings great songs. A must for all music lovers.
5,Wheels on the Bus DVD,This is a Great DVD!! My grandson really loves to watch this! I would highly recommend this for anyone 2+ years. :)
4,Wheels on the bus review,I bought this item for grandchildren who are 22 months old. It was bought as a Christmas gift at the suggestion of their mother. They watched it several times during the time we spent with them and they enjoyed it very much.
1,Extreme Waste of Money,"Horrible, as is there other album, The only good album they ever put out was 6 Feet Deep all the other albums are a disgrace to the name Gravediggaz, they shoulda kept it wicked and sick like 6 feet deep...if they do ever do another album I pray that they will finnally realize what the fans want is ANOTHER 6 FEET DEEP!!!!!!!! We want horror, not weak ish!"
5,False Things must perish....,"This album is just another great one to add to the legacy of this horrorcore group, defenitely worth picking up. I loved their first, and their second conscious album. It is a shame that Gry had to die and this is the end of the group as we know it, even though Rza and Prince Paul were absent. The beats are still tight and the lryics are very concisous for the deaf dumb and blind people of today. Like the song says, False things must perish, go cop this joint."
3,little disappointed,"I love working with my De Longhi machine but this attachment is not the best. It has to be attached on top of the machine and you have to use a different bowl than the one from the machine which causes a lot of ""waste"" because the distance between the shredder and the bowl is too big."
4,Hillbillies.,"If you ever wanted aan A to Z book on the Beverly Hillbillies, I guess this would be that book. If I took one thing away from this well written book, its that these actors certainly were not their characters. For the most part, they were like polar opposites. A lot of excelent pictures also. Very good book."
1,Pressing Quality Is Horrendous,Great music. Horrible pressing quality. This is the second copy I have received and I will be returning it and giving up. If the record companies want people to continue buying these high quality vinyl remasters the quality of the pressings need to match the music. and packaging. Amazon has been wonderful to work with on the returns. I buy many new vinyl releases and most are very good quality so I am not sure what is up with this one but it is virtuallty unlistenable with all of the pops and static during the songs.
2,Not as informative as I had hoped,"As an avid studier of bestial relations throughout the ages, I was keen on finding what this book had to offer. Unfortunately the potted history of Seventeenth century sodom was not what I expected. Anyone who practices bestiality will tell you that Herdsdale sheep are by far and away the most suited to homo sapiens and that Riggotts goats and possibly THE most uncomfortable to couple with out there in the fields whereas this book positively glossed over these two important breeds.Unfortunately where I live in Sutton there's precious little opportunity to enjoy ""the countryside"" in this manner so I look to such books to ""keep my eye in"". Whilst a fairly entertaining read, it failed to ""get my goat""."
3,Big Disappointment,We had been to concerts where Frank Vignola played traditional jazz and we loved it. He has 5 star talent and Gershwin speaks for itself. This album was far too progressive for us. Too many numbers where Gershwin was lost.
3,Good but not the best,"The selection was not totally what I have expected, but in any case it has two of their best (for me)songs."
5,STRONG ROCKIN' CD!,"This comeback for the Animal's Eric Burdon is a powerful blues/rock CD. For a 65 year old man, or the age of The Rolling Stones, this is a great soul-drenched CD with good singing, superb playing and an excellent recording. It's very interesting and entertaining with different flavored songs and even has some New Orleans rock. A helluva' mighty fine tasty CD to enjoy many times over, this treasure will often be played and is a must-have to round out your rock collection."
1,Waste of money,I bought this toy looking at the name Melissa & Doug...My son is 2 year old. It just took 10 mins for my son to sort out all the puzzles. The paint on the blocks chips out and smells... Paint smell on the toy really irritates me...Overall I do not recomond this product.
5,Simple idea--Big fun,"My 2 year old received this over a year ago. In the beginning, it got lost under the electronic, attention-grabbing toys. However, it later emerged and he became facinated with matching the shapes to the holes. He has now learned that there are many alternate options (e.g. two trianges can make a square, two squares can make a rectangle, etc.). He and his little sister also like to stack the pieces to make sandwiches! Although this is not their most sophisticated or exciting toy, it is one of few that consistently holds their interest."
4,Helps in imagination growth,"My 2.5 yr kid enjoys it. It helps in learning shapes, colors and also drives her to imagine more with the various shapes provided."
2,Toy,Did not play with this for long. Pieces got lost very fast. Gave it away to someone else. Didn't get any use of this
4,"Great toy, but missing one thing: a cover","My almost-3 year old loves these puzzles. There are a dozen of them (I think) which provides for lots of variety, and he loves putting together several at a time. It's also helping him learn his shapes better.The product is missing one thing: A top cover. All these parts and pieces (close to 30 pieces) have nothing to keep them contained when the box is tipped over. Other than that, I have no complaints. Great toy."
1,"Chipping paint, terrible odor out of the box","I don't like writing negative reviews, and I have a lot of Melissa and Doug products that I think are great. But right out of the box the paint was peeling off all the puzzles, and worst of all they had an overpowering, terrible odor that made my head ache. I don't want my children, or anyone else, inhaling that odor on a regular basis. I love the idea of this toy and would have kept it even with the chipped paint, but I couldn't get past how badly it smelled, and returned it. Perhaps the odor might dissipate over time but that's not very comforting to me. Really disappointing. I will say I have not had this happen with other Melissa and Doug products, maybe this was just a bad batch."
4,Splendidly disjointed,"I will go out on a limb, John Irving notwithstanding, to say this book tends toward the silliness it seeks to describe. WTCONC is an almost gratifying read. The author's cut-up method is sometimes annoying. The last two pages are the strongest. I only wish the estimable Mr. Trow would elaborate on the sense of loss of his childhood days. This is a frame I wish I could revisit more often in the book. He certainly does not fit well, like many bohemians on the margins outside the grid of two million, with the temprament of this sorry age. The blurbs on the back cover of this edition are very embarrassing. Much like a beat-up fedora hat. Hardly vintage clothing. Hardly a watershed"
4,Thouroughly Enjoyable,"I am a huge fan of Top Gear, and I greatly enjoy Jeremy Clarkson and his brand of humor. I bought this almost blind, and I was pleasently suprised by it. The book itself is a collection of his columns for The Sunday Times in the UK. His articles cover a wide variety of topics, including Enviornmentalism, Politics, Dining, Culture, and Celebrities. The humor is much different from that of Top Gear, but it is still utterly hilarious. Clarkson is a one of a kind Journalist, of the sort we dont really get here in the US. It has to be said, for any non British readers, some of the references may go a bit over your head, as alot of the articles focus on a headline of the day. Other than that, I have no complaints. The World According to Clarkson is a must read for any fans of the Opiniated and Often Ingenious Clarkson."
1,Not As Advertised,"This item was supposed to be ""Water resistant to 200 meters assisted by the screw-down case and crown."" The watch when received did not have a screw down case and crown. Water resistance was doubtful. Returned the watch."
3,"Okay, but not as described.","The belt is okay, it fits and the price was decent, but is not the knurled belt for the vacuum I have."
3,Better way to save money,"I have found that it's better to line the bottom of your toaster oven with heavy-duty aluminum foil. The result is better than a liner - just replace the foil. This is a far less expensive alternative - and works for your oven, too."
2,way too small,"This was a very disappointing product....one of those that look oh-so -good and cannot live up to a good cook's standards. It is incredibly small. In today's 'toaster oven' marketplace, the sizes of the toaster/convection portable ovens are far larger than the products of years ago. It seems this company has designed this for the toaster ovens of the 80's....certainly not to the standard of today's ovens. To put it clearly....it covers about 1/3 or the floor of your toaster oven...therefore does not do much good at all except in the very center where normal drips from a baking pan do NOT occur. If you have a very tiny toaster oven, perhaps you will be satisfied."
1,Teflon kills birds,I used this oven liner when baking a pot roast on Christmas Day 2005. Both my cockatiel pet birds fell over dead during dinner. I called the gas company and there was no Carbon Monoxide or gas leaks. I found out about teflon products killing many other pet birds when I reseached teflon toxicosis.
3,just ok,this can not be used on the bottom of the toaster oven or the regular oven. Each seems to do the job of keeping the bottom of the oven clean. The material is a bit thin; I would have liked a thicker product.
3,Ooops - I thought this was a toaster oven 'pan' liner,I ordered this item thinking it was a pan liner. I already have a toaster-oven sized silicon pan liner that is so used it is due for replacement... I will have to keep looking for one as this is a liner for the bottom of the toaster oven.
1,misleading,"I was misled by this item because it has a pic of Oven. I dont know know why a WHOLE OVEN is put up here. I dont need so called ""Liner"" but an oven. Liner is worthless, what I was doing is to be careful when you toast. Oh, Jesus. It's my fault of rushness, but it is really misleading by putting an oven pic here!"
1,DO NOT USE THIS LINER IF YOU HAVE PET BIRDS!!!,This product should have a large bold warning on the outside of the box - DO NOT USE THIS LINER IF YOU HAVE PET BIRDS!!! My 10 year old green checked conure and my red factor canary suddenly dropped dead after I used this liner in my oven. I will be contacting the manufacturer of this product with my concerns. What effect does this product have on humans and other pets if it kills birds???
3,"Nice Cruiser, Dumb Accessory","My 4-year-old is new to Rescue Heroes so we started his collection for Christmas. We bought this cruiser, but I didn't really understand that you needed the action figure-sidekick combo to really have fun with it (the talking back and forth). My son doesn't really care, he just uses the 2 regular figures he got. He drives it all over the house and it seems to really be a sturdy toy. The robot thing you snap onto the bottom is really stupid, though. Did anyone even test it before putting it on the market? I can't get it into place quite right and when you use it as a wench to pull something else it just falls right off. Good thing my child is creative, he just has the robot stand up and pull ""stuck cars"" out of the ""mud"" by itself."
1,Content needs to be brought up to date.,"Want to code bit mapped circles and arcs? Want to re-invent ""pong?"" This is your book. Want to code business aplications - this book is a waste. There is more attention paid by the author to ""Fun With Fonts"" than to things that have been significantly improved in .NET like TreeView.I get the sense Petzold wrote the original content for this book back in the 80's and has re-cycled it one time too many.The title of the book inferred a little bit of help in using VB.NET to tap into the new Window's .NET Framework. It does - but it sticks to the things you could do in the Windows API several years ago. IMHO, in 2004 we are way beyond lines, curves, brushes, pens, images and bitmaps.This is another author going through the motions and updating old content."
1,Misleading Title,"I bought this book recently along with the (far superior) book ""Programming Microsoft Visual Basic .Net"" by Francesco Balena. The titles are remarkably similar, yet the content of each book couldn't be more different.The Petzold book ignores most of the concepts which I would deem to be most important in .NET, such as all the new OOP features of the language (Inheritance, Interfaces, ADO.NET, etc.). Instead, an inordinate amount of detail is spent explaining things like how to play around with brushes, pens and fonts. In the world of enterprise development, I couldn't care less about these operations. I'm interested in topics like what ADO.Net can offer me when building a 3 tier architecture. If I want to display pretty graphs, I'll buy a 3rd party control to do it for me.For those who are more interested in ""Windows Form Specific"" operations, this book might be the one for you. As an introductory text to .NET, your time would be much better spent looking elsewhere."
5,Everything and more!,They had everything I needed along with course software in the book. It was delivered promptly and without any problems.
4,Great read,"Typical Larry Bond book, full of twists and turns and graphic battle scenes. The only draw back is the current power structure inEurope which stretches the imagination a step too far."
3,3 1/2 stars -- good but not great,"Having read and enjoyed most of the other novels by Bond, I decided to go back and give Cauldron a try. I truly enjoyed Red Phoenix and Vortex, with both being great novels that highlight geopolitical conflict and ground war action. Unfortunately I found that Cauldron was not on the same level as these other two works. Although Cauldron follows a similar model of regional conflict that threatens to expand into a wider conflict, the story seemed to be less plausible to me. Ignoring the believability issue for a moment, however, Bond's writing does capture the essence of a high-tech military thriller, complete with action that is fast, furious, gut-wrenching and intense. Bond kept me turning the pages, but at the conclusion it did not seem be as satisfying to have finished. Overall, I would have to say that Cauldron was good but not great."
3,"It was OK. Not one of Mr. Bonds Best, but OK","It was Ok. After reading Red Pheonix and Vortex, I was let down. France and Germany Team up to form Eurcon (the bad guys). They try and take over all of europe. The USA (the good guys) ride (fly, sail, march, parachute) in in the nick of time and save the day. If you are a fan of Larry Bond, read it. If your not ,read Clancy."
4,It was OK,"It was ok. If you want a good overview of modern warfare, read this book. I read Vortex and I read Red Pheniox, this book was not as good.France and Germany, along with several smaller Western European Countries unite to form EurCon, the dreaded all consuming monster.There is lots of shooting and blood, and in the end, the good guys win. A very predictable story.However, if one is just interested in hi-tech action and modern wargames, this is a book for you.It is filled with Mr. Bond's usual details of the hi-tech modern day warfare. For this reason alone, this book is a must read for the personwho is a fan of the Clancy-Bond genre. Just get it in paperback, its cheaper."
3,"Great action, but underdeveloped characters","This one definitely has a lot of great action, but it just seemed to scratch the surface of what was really going on. Bond did a good job of telling me WHAT was going on, but not as much WHY or what the characters felt. In other words, the characters were developed poorly. But other than that, it was actually a very good book. Still not to the Red Storm Rising standard of WWIII, but interesting even so. Military nuts will enjoy this one, but anyone with limited military knowledge may not enjoy it as much."
3,"Bond's best, but still far short of Clancy","Larry Bond has the technical details nailed in this book, but his characters are underdeveloped. I found myself jumping alot ahead in the book and not really missing anything."

5,Great message,"As a quiliter, I thought this would be a nice children's book with pretty quilt pictures. But it is much more than that. The message in this book is one for children and adults to learn from."
4,Good work out shorts,Not much to say really. These are very good work out shorts. I wear them to the gym on a regular basis and they are comfortable and functional. The pockets are nice.
4,"""Dear Detective"" (AKA: "" Dear Inspector"")","A very good production of a favorite French comedy (with sub-titles). An outstanding cast and a fun plot. A female French Chief Inspector of Police is much more interested in romantically pursuing a reluctant, liberal ""anti- police"" professor than solving a serial killing which occasionally interferes. Typical of ""Pardon Mon Affaire"" and ""The Tall Blonde Man"" era. What favorably impressed me about Amazon was that the original copy that I was sent was of rather poor quality. When I contacted the seller, despite some initial well intentioned confusion in which they kept offering a full refund if I so desired, they rapidly sent a replacement copy in excellent condition, at no charge."
5,This is truly a wonderful and easy-to-follow program.,I have never lost so much weight so quickly as I have through this program. It is easy to follow and it makes sense. The weight actually flew off in no time. The recipes offered are delicious. I served them to my family and everyone enjoyed them. I highly recommend this book and program to anyone who is serious about losing weight.
3,remastered ????,"This a review of the REMASTERED Past Masters. Having listened to both CDs on headphones I came to the conclusion that the first 1987 release actually sounded a little bit better. But the THE REMASTERED CD did sound a tad better on ""day tripper."""
1,Horrible sound,This is the worst beatles album I have ever heard..The disc lacks any bass and some songs do noyt even sound like the Beatles.. ...The whole disc is poorly recorded old beatles songs with manly lyrics and highs but no lows or much midrange..I have a good system with good cables and powercords..This might be the worst recorded disc that I own by any artist.
3,not enough snuff,"this recording of substandard quality. flat, hollow and lackluster. have other beatle cd's with much better sound. sounds as if they used the (unremastered) masters. only bought it for one song - rain.Past Masters (Remastered)"
2,I Only Like One Song,"I mostly got this for Black Velvet.....but of course, I was going to listen to the rest of the album. Listened to it twice and I honestly just don't like it. I can't pinpoint what my reason is, all I know is, that I don't like. Luckily I didn't pay much for it."
4,80's Rock,"This is a typical example of the rock music that was around in the late 80's. The start of when the female vocalist was taken serious. Alannah has the voice to make you sit up and take notice. With a great voice, mixed with catchy song including the huge hit Black Velvet, it is definately worth a listen."
3,This is Sound Stage 2003,"My husband and I saw Chris Isaak for the first time on Sound Stage in the October of 2005, in his blue sequined suit and we were so impressed with the show, we leaped out of our chairs and ran to Amazon to order it. There it was-Chris Isaak 2005-GREAT and in the cart. It is an ok DVD, but it is from and earlier Sound Stage done in 2003. The band is much more subdued, the song selection is not as good and though we are not going to send it back we were disappointed. Just thought I would warn you. Also the bonus tracks are other people not Isaak. Hope this is helpful. Catherine"
4,Small block but big fun,"I have some wooden blocks from my childhood that my godson loves and plays with every time he visits. So I decided to buy him some. I LOVED the price on these, and from the picture guessed they were exactly what I was looking for. I guess I should probably say the blocks I have are BIG. Some are about 6 inches and the smallest are maybe 2 inches. Great for my 2.5 year old godson who has a newborn brother. Zero choking risk. The blocks I received are SMALL!!! Most are about one inch. Definitely small enough for a kid to get in their mouth. My godson still LOVES them. He built houses, roads and all kids of things. We even learned a few shapes with out him really knowing he was learning. I would recommend them for slightly older children due to the fact that the small size makes them a bit more difficult to stack for those with less developed motor skills. Over all I""m pretty happy with them I just wish they were a bit bigger."
5,Simply refreshing.,"I was searching for a book that taught how to instantly get into a magickal mindset before I bought this book. After reading the reviews for it, I decided to purchase it, and I am so glad that I did. Penczak's writing style is refreshing for those new to the Craft, or to those who have practiced for decades. His methods in the book for instantly getting into that magickal mindset - and creating magick - are the key points in this book. Although the ""instant magick trigger"" (Alpha) was discussed and demonstrated prior in many of Laurie Cabot's books, Penczak gives 'instant spells' using the trigger (the parking space spell really works well!), expanding on Cabot's concept.If you feel like you've lost your magickal ""edge"" (so to speak), or want a refreshing course on spellcasting and how it affects us all, this is the book to get. Thank you, Mr. Penczak."
5,"Clear, concise, amazing","This is one of the most non-threatening, easy to follow books on magick that I have ever read. The author 's style of writing invites one to really think about the ""why and what""of magick in a contemporary way. He doesn't overwhelm the reader with the heavy duty esoterical stuff. In other word's, he makes accessing and working with magick approachable."
5,Great book,"While it clearly shows you how to make your own high quality planes, it actually provides a succinct introduction not only to their use, but to all the tools useful in their making. It's a beautifully focussed introduction to woodworking that is neither boring nor insulting to those already knowledgeable. As a bonus, the photo in the introduction of a child using a plane is worth the price of the book.After reading this book from the library, I want to buy a copy. How can it be out of print?! It should be reprinted."
3,villsica,i thought this might be a documantry about the axe murder house. it was ok but i was really hopeing for a doc not a fiction story. still the movie was ok but it could have been better. i do plan to vist villisca real soon.
1,Haunting Villisca,"I have been to Villisca, Iowa. I took a tour of the house. I did not feel the house was haunted. However the man that played Darwin in the film is the real person who owns the house. He knows what he is talking about when he tells the story of the murders. I was looking forward to this film coming out. Darwin had told us about the making of the movie.I was disappointed in the movie I was hoping it was going to be about the events of that day and night of the murders. Not this made up story, what a shame. I hope someday, someone will tell the story of the axe murders in Villisca, Iowa and leave the haunting out of it!"
4,Great Family Fun,This Karaoke Machine was a great buy. It does exactly what it was advertised to do and works great. It is also a plus having the dual microphones. The only drawback is the camera stopped working after a few months.
3,disc holder closing lid;.;;,the actual product is great...but the first time my son used it...the latch that holds the CD in broke off on the cover...soooo duct tape was being used to keep it shut...and I suppose it will be that way forever...only disappointment....
2,Still trying to send it back!,My daughter was so excited until I said it had to go back. CD Drive was not working! We had trouble getting it apart and I am still waiting for Singing Machine to send me a return lable. They say they don't carry this model anymore??? but will send another. What a pain! I have spent alot of time on hold!!!
4,"""Dis"" is a great accessory, but","This device looks cool and acts cool, but you should only buy this if you have over 2 usb devices. If you don't, you shouldn't bother with this product unless you are planning to get a usb device soon. Other than that, this is a pretty cool product with no flaws."
1,Quick start but ends in a fizzle,"I can not imagine how this book got published! The author must be related to the publisher. I have never read a book in which so much was said about things of no relevance. A decent little story which could have been told in 25% of the words used, the sheriff wanders through all of his grubby history, leaving the plot dangling so long that I had difficulty picking up the storyline again. After awhile, I decided I didn't care much. However, I did finish it -- trying to at least get something for my money -- but I knew what I was up against after the first 25 pages. The only value I see in this book is to use in in a book on how to write, under a chapter titled ""Don't let this happen to you."""
3,"Great premise, but tedious at times","White Crosses does not match the quality of one of Watson's earlier books, Montana 1948. The reader is asked to endure a great deal of tedious introspection, and the tone is unvariably bleak and morose. The moral conflicts are intriguing, however, as shades of gray collide with different shades of gray. The books plods along slowly, but picks up near the end."
2,Be Careful!,"Be careful! I have a Dell Inspiron 600m laptop, which this is being advertising as working with. But I looked at the label included in the photo here and compared to my Dell AC adaptor. The model #s are different, but more importantly, the specs are different. Both are AC: 100-240 V; 1.5 A. Both are DC: 19.5 V. BUT...mine is DC: 4.62 A (amps) and the adaptor for sale here is 3.34 A (amps). I believe that could cause significant damage to your laptop. It was very good of the seller to include the photos, but this does not fit an inspiron 600m--at least not one sold in May 2004. Perhaps newer or older inspiron models do use this adaptor. If all the specs match your laptop, then at least you can't hurt your computer (I think...); the only remaining problem is whether or not it fits."
4,Loyal Mobb Deep Fan,"I thought Blood Money was one of The Mobb's best efforts. Of course it does not compare to The Infamous or to Murda Muzik but Blood Money is tight.The fact that Havoc still had a lot of production on the album (I think a bit over 70%) says to me that 50 was not trying to take over. I am not really a 50 fan (The Massacre was a disaster to me) but I respect his creative ideas. And even the other producers on the album still kept the sound somewhat Havoc-inspired.A lot of people are confusing their reviews of Blood Money with their hatred for 50. Hatred, or just tiredness of 50 aside, Blood Money is dope. (Pearly Gates is ridiculous!!!)Just give it a listen and try to be open minded. They have been around for almost 15 years. We owe them at least an unbiased listen."
4,MOBB,""" Its not how many people you shoot, it's who you shoot.""They still the MOBB ya'll. Beautiful timeless album. I loved it."
2,Still Mobb Deep,"First off I don't care that they signed with G-Unit I could give a f**k. It is just there lyrics are getting weaker. Putting 50 on the tracks don't really help anything. They along with the rest of the crew talk about the same subjects things they got, money and hoes. Man rap has gotten dipressing. The second problem I have is P's verse on Pearly Gates, I am religous and I think it's retarted to be talking down on anyones religion. I won't hold these against him because he just speakin his mind but it is still wrong to be talkin like that. 2/5 Only real good track is Put Em In They Place."
3,good but no clasic,"Let me atart off by sying that i have been listening to rap for almost 20 plus years and personaly feel The Infamous"" & ""Hell On Earth"" theese were thier best works this cd is cool if you are a true die hard G Unit groopie, but us true hip hop heads will find this album as dry as a desert in Summer half the beats sound amature, and half the rymes sound like they recyled them from other cats song books, but my younger cousins, they think classic rap is Eminem lol, are feeling it so I give it 3 stars."
1,Almost cried,"Shit man. That f***er 50 sucks, takes the old Mobb Deep and changes them to his style, when I heard this album I just felt like I was listening to 50's album. Not just because Mobb Deep aint the same anymore, the main reason was because 50 is nearly on half of the fockin album. And not just that, also Young Buck, Lloyd Banks and Fony Yayo. And maan... M.O.P not on one song. This is just a disapointment that mobb deep whent from ""The Infamous - Survival of the Fittest & Shook Ones Pt. II"" which is on my top 10 list over best hip-hop songs ever, to ""Blood Money - Put 'Em in Their Place"" which is one of the worst things I've ever heard and make me have a different feeling about Mobb Deep. The only song I can listen to on this cd is Pearly Gates, Havoc was good on that one, didn't really like Prodigy, his rhymes were not his usual. And 50... surprisingly alright (though I don't like him... The Game fan..G-unot). So these are my resoults. If I could I whould give this album 0,5."
1,I Refuse!,"After such a reputation in the Rap Game, Mobb is Riding Da DDDD...of all people 50. I never. I haven't heard the CD all I see is 50 and his camp all over the joint and I know I would rather not hear. After all of the work they have put in over past 10 years and all of the tight MC's that exist they have camp-out with G=Unit. I guess that one hot track f/50 from the Free Agents was enough to give them trust in his reputation. Well they are 1 on billboard so I guess it worked. I guess after Common road on Kanye's dddddddd which didn't actually work in his favor. And I don't care if you agree, it is what it is and I know it is garbage without even listening that is how SMART I AM! It is averaging 3 stars and for rap artist with such credibility that equals GARBAGE. HA HA! The OJAY'S ONCE MADE A SONG CALLED FOR THE LOVE OF M O N E Y! What a Waste!"
2,Wake Up!!,"Seriously people wake up Mobb Deep have not had a good album since ""Hell On Earth"". Prodigy is a much better producer than rapper and Havoc....give me a break.This Album will sell because its on G-Unit and thats the whole point but as far as skills Mobb Deep hasn't been the same since Pac ripped them a new one and that was 10 years ago. So if you are a Mobb Deep fan I don't know what you're complaining about this album sounds like all the garbage they've put out this decade."
5,F##k you people!!! This is a great album!!!!,"I'm so sick of these stupid G-Unit haters saying that this album is garbage simply because Mobb Deep is on G-Unit now. It's not ""Hell on Earth"" and it's not ""The Infamous"". When are we gonna stop demanding another album on that caliber from Havoc and P? It's not gonna happen any time soon. This is still a lot better than ""Amerikaz Nightmare"" which was ok but a bit of a let down. This is still one of the year's best albums."
5,Readers Will Glean Shot Saving Tips,"My favorite golfer here reveals some of his thinking about the game.Renowned for his tempo, short game and scrambling ability, you'll take away much in these areas.From reading this, I too now play gloveless. It saves money, I feel the clubhead much better and have much better grip pressure from making this change.Another tip that has saved many shots in my rounds, is that when the ball is down snug in the grass, play pitch shots down the line.Freddie has many like these in here you'll find so useful as well. Good stuff!"
5,The Best Golf Book for Me,"This book has helped me more than any other.I have changed my swing recently from the flatter Hogan to the more upright Couples swing plane.This book explains how Fred Couples swings the club from driver to putter, and it explains what you should do if your swing is not exactly like Fred's.Also, some nice insights and tips on how to be more relaxed mentally.My driver speed has definitely increased, iron shots now have a slight fade,less stress on my body.After leaving my local practice range, I'm happier than ever-finally more progress.I also had to make an equipment change. As my clubs (6-3 iron) have too much of a flat lie.BTW- I'm 6'3"" 205 lb."
3,"Not a bad theory, but actual recipes leave something desired","I've only tried it once so far, but this is what I found. The book is wonderfully ordered, and organized. The spreadsheets very helpful. I made several things, cooked all day, and had a blast doing it. Now that I get to eat what I cooked, I'm finding I have to doctor everything with flavor. It's very bland so far. I'm thinking because the spices don't freeze well, which is fine, but the recipes could have suggested using the spices when heating up.Plan on using the theory often, just using my recipes, and/or fixing theirs."
3,great ideas not so great tasting,While I enjoyed the book's concepts and found the recipes and preperation easy to follow I found that the recipes are not so tasty. Several of them were just too repetitive and not something I would enjoy eating day in and day out.
5,Dusk and Dawn at New Hope,The audio is beautiful. These are recordings of morning bird song and evening crickets and other creatures. It sounds just like the world I left in the 50's. It's really God's music.
1,This game..,"....doesn't run with WindowsXP. Folks should know this if they have that OS and are thinking of buying this game. I learned this the hard way. In lieu of zero stars, I'm forced to give it one star, as one cannot post a review without stars."
3,Mature means [swearing] alot!!,"I love good story adventures and this one was ok, but to just throw in FU every few minutes didn't appear very mature. The movement thru the plot usually just meant you had to have the character move back and forth to listen to different characters until you got them to say something, that when you returned to the first character would allow for the prompt so you could ask them what you wanted to the first time. Characters that you talk to die later and there is a gal talking about her lesbian lover, so I guess that qualifies under mature, but none of that is necessary to the plot and appears obvious that it was just thrown in to allow for those that wouldn't buy the magic of two worlds without thinking it was a kiddy game unless they could label it ""mature"".I found the story line novel and don't regret buying it, but I could have done without the ""mature"" added parts."
4,very good game with way too much dialogue,"This is an excellent game, which contrary to another reviewers comments, runs very well on Win XP, but does require a video card with 3D ability. The graphics were excellent, the story interesting and it was very long so you get a lot for your money. The only problem was the neverending blah, blah, blah from every character you meet. I like interaction in a game, but this was way too yacky. Overall, if you like adventure games you will like this game a lot but just prepare for many long discussions with assorted characters about things you don't care about."
2,Back To Basics,"This DVD is great if you have never, ever ridden a motorbike before. However, if you have some experience and are looking for a DVD that can give you a bit more assistance with getting down the basics of riding such as braking, cornering and so, this is not it. While the DVD does cover these things in some small way, the vast majority of the hour long presentation is spent on things like getting on and off the bike, learning the controls, getting the bike moving and so on.Good for a complete novice but not for anyone who has ridden for more than a day."
2,Unique,"While one must recognize Mr. Newman's virtuosic technique on this album, one also recognize that playing fast is not the ultimate goal of playing. Overall, his tempos were almost too brisk. One got the impression that he was trying to prove that he could play very quickly.In addition, his registrations were rather bizarre. For example, in the Prelude and Fugue in e (Cathedral), while the echoe effect of the fugue was intriguing, the prelude far from conveyed the majestic quality of the writing. The registration was thin and whiny.Perhaps the biggest disappointment was the Passacaglia and Fugue. This piece seemed to suffer particularly from Mr. Newman's registrations and tempo. Schizophrenic would be the word that comes to mind when describing it.I give this album two stars, only because Mr. Newman played all the notes acurately. Moving from there, however, he failed to deliver. For a great Bach recording, I recommend WIlliam Porter's ""One of a Kind."""
4,Detailed and Comprehensive,"This book is a detailed and thorough text that offers the reader not only guitar construction techniques, but the reasonings behind each decision. Young's writing style is simple and easy to follow, and I found his methods quite comfortable. And you don't have to have the world's greatest workshop to get the job done! The only drawbacks would be the illustrations and photographs, which are black and white and, at times, not as detailed as I would have preferred. But otherwise, this is a solid book with all the info you need to make that first acoustic six- or twelve-string guitar."
1,JUNK,"I would not buy this item. I was excited on getting training wheels on my 24 inch bike that was so hard to find, I never learn how to ride a bicycle when I was young and wanted to do so for the summer with my daughter. When I receive the item and install it on the bike, it was really heavy and was not able to turn the bike. I end up taking it out of the bike and learn on my own without the training wheels. This item was cheaply make and the wheels are so flimsy that makes it hard to even ride on a straight line not to mention turning. I will NOT recommend this item."
3,to get refund,"I really the training wheels, but I was scared to fall. The bike was hard to turn left or right.It was more dangerous for me to turn and drive on the road.ThanksHarkamal"
2,Didn't fit my daughter bike with > 0.75 frame tube. Returned them,"Didn't fit my daughter bike with > 0.75 frame tube. Returned them to get Wald 10252 Bicycle Training Wheels (16 to 20-Inch Wheels, .75 and 1-Inch Frame Tubes). Why would make something that is not standard and fits all bike's frame tubes size?!"
3,"Good, but needs work","The wheels are good and solid built and I would give it a 5 star review if it wasn't for one thing, the braces that attaches the wheels to the bicycle frame just didn't fit.The braces I am talking about is to make sure that the wheels don't turn back or forward, so it stays in place. Because I could not attach it, the wheels are not very reliable and trustworthy enough for my daughter ( whom has major confidence issues )and she pretty much gave up riding the bike.I believe a little visit to the close walmart or target would help the builder of this part a lot.If you have a 20"" schimn bicycle, don't buy this"
5,Laughed until I cried!,"Putting these actors together is a sure mix for total insanity! You will need a box of kleenex though, cause you'll laugh until you cry!"
3,OK for a slow night when you can not find anything elce to watch.,"I seen this movie when it first cam out, it has not aged well. It still has some funny parts but moves at a slow pace."
3,The End,"entertaining movie - however, the year the movie was made is reflected at times - more slow moving than if it had been made in this millenium"
3,Photography fine; text not so fine,"I bought this book for the number of quilts from the American South it seemed to include. I do not regret the purchase because the price was sale price and the photographs of quilts, mainly from 5 southern sites, are worth that much. But I do not recommend the book to someone for whom accurate details about American quilts is important. The author did not see most of these quilts and depended on the photographer and others for information. Many times the information is incorrect (e.g., the Whig's Defeat). I also found myself questioning descriptions like a ""silk Star of Bethlehem"" in the NC teal and cheddar combination that are almost certainly inaccurate. But for the pleasure of seeing a variety of quilts in interesting settings and for the British quilts, the book is interesting and a good addition to a quilt collector's library"
3,Early Gene Wilder Comedy,"If you're a Wilder fan, you'll want to see this one that he wrote and starred in early in his career. Good to see but not as satisfying as later comedies."
4,"A Tad Dry, but Compelling","Livy's work is spectacular. However he has a tendancy to stretch the facts to make a moral judgement (ie: his assertion that 'Capua was Hannibal's Cannae' came immediately after the section where Hannibal is resting his army after entering Capua.The narrative style is easily comprehended, and after reading one book you have the order figured out.This is a must read for anyone interested in the Punic Wars, the Roman Republic, or parallels to the USA and our ""war"" on terrorism (especially since Bin Ladin is being compared to Hannibal)"
5,Best singer: Judy Garland. Her Best Work: A Star Is Born,COLUMBIA CL 1101 Original 1954 MonoFEATURING: Judy Garland - Vocalist; Harold Arlen - Music; Ira Gershwin - Lyrics; Ray Heindorf - Musical Director; Leonard Gershe - Composer; Shaun Considine - Liner NotesSIDE 1: Gotta Have Me To Go With You; The Man That Got Away; Born In A Trunk; Medley (I'll Get By; You Took Advantage of Me; Black Bottom; The Peanut Vendor; My Melancholy Baby; Swanee)SIDE 2: Here's What I'm Here For; It's A New World; Someone At Last; Lose That Long Face
2,Didn't like,"Somehow this book simply didn't appeal to me. It meanders all over the place, with no dates so you're often left to guess the chronology. Occasional reminiscences about bygone missionaries, their wives, church bells and so on. Not a travel book by any means. Although to be fair, the parts about flying boats and tropical diseases were quite interesting. If you are interested in the South Pacific, I'd reccomend as light fare ""The Sex Lives of Cannibals: Adrift in the Equatorial Pacific"" by J. Maarten Troost and the best I've ever read ""The Fatal Impact: The Invasion of the South Pacific, 1767-1840"""
3,"Cynical book, a light read, condescending","A cynical book by an old man who has seen it all. It grates to read his snobby comments. Not much compassion but rather condensation when read between the lines. The elliptical nature of his ramblings did not bother me that much--he will give flashbacks of events that occurred elsewhere--but his condensation is palpable. The author has been around and seen it all, and drops names to prove it; also he has come in contact with numerous other famous travel writers. But I did not like his undercurrent of sarcasm and Western elitism. And yes I've been to the tropics and it is rather hopeless from a developed country point of view, but one could do without the constant snide remarks. Hey if you don't like the tropics just stay home in England. A bit of optimism would have sweetened the narrative. The book is best read quickly as a light read, and then binned when done. I bought mine second hand in Thailand."
4,"An immersive, fully realized world.","I am a sucker for world building and mythology, and ""Nightwatch"" has a very fully realized world. The book is set in the modern era, in Russia, yes. But it deals with people who do not live in the same world we, the reader, do. It's a different world with different laws and regulations, different customs, different dangers. And it's a world that feels very intensely real.The characters are broadly sketched but individual, and moral quandries are thick on the ground-- not obviously at first, but more and more so as the book progresses. What seems to be a black and white divide between ""good"" and ""evil,"" between ""light"" and ""dark,"" becomes more and more shaded grey as events unfold.It's a book of explosions, frustration, desperate attempts at saving the world, and morality. It's well written and well translated, and I highly recomend it."
5,Great Watch,I am very impressed with the write. He never seems to drop the ball on the character development. The characters are the true gems here. The story is amazing but the characters are so well written that nothing else compares.
3,Just OK,"I liked the first story in this several story collection. But then the author kept repeating his views on good/evil and the fruitlessness of trying to better humanity as humanity will always be the way they want to be. The author makes every story have some sort of twist with the ""good"" guys tricking each other to reach their own ends. Kinda like the end justifies the means. I was dissapointed in the over all tone of this book."
3,Dresden files meets harry potter.,"Dresden files meets harry potter, sums up the style of this book. A book about wizard & vampires.The writing and the story are very good. However I didn't like the characters much. And being unsympathetic to the lead characters made the book a disappointment, as everything else about it is very good."
4,RETRO SURF BLAST !!!!,"I really, really, really, enjoyed this CD the first time I put it on. I like it even more with repeated listening. The thing thats different about ""Thrills and Chills"" is the variety of themes woven into this recording. It goes from spooky 60's flavored Halloween tunes to 50's exotica, to ear blasting surf and then to spy jazz. But it works!!! Totally different styles but they all blend perfectly into the same genre. I've bought a lot of CD's that have TRIED to do the same thing BUT THESE GUYS PULL IT OFF WITH STYLE. My only complaint is with the 11 tracks it should have been longer. I WANT MORE!"
5,Rocco Scores a Winner,"This is one of those CDs I play repeatedly but don't get tired of. I saw Rocco on a VH-1 special -- I was intrigued by his slide guitar work and like his voice so I got the CD. There's not a bad song on here - Mystify Me is great, as are Colorful and Dope. The rest are not far behind. The overall sound is reminiscent of early Led Zepplin and takes me back to my early days of listening to rock and roll."
5,Awesome CD!,"I had a chance to listen to Rocco last week at a private KFOG Radio station recording in San Francisco. He blew my mind. This artist is going places! His voice is amazing, his guitar work is inspiring, and his songwriting poetic and meaningful. If you like artists such as Radiohead, Jeff Buckley, Led Zep, Lifehouse, Train, and any other soulful singers, you will like Rocco. I really enjoyed talking to Rocco after the show and also at a freak meeting a few hours later at the Virgin megastore while buying the CD. He is an all around great guy and you can tell he loves his craft. Please do yourself a favor and buy this CD and then tell your friends to discover a new talent."
5,awesome deal,Best deal you could ask for. Paid for one and got 2 free along with free shipping. They will all be gifts for grandchildren
1,Bambi 2 disc special Edition,I purchased this item thinking that I was getting an original Walt Disney DVD. What I got was a bootleg copy of this movie. Very poor image and quality. I was very dissapointed. How sad.
2,Mildly unsatisfied,The disc itself worked fine but the case it came in was broken. The center piece that holds the disc in place is what is broken. This causes the disk to slide around in the case.
5,Disney's best golden age film it dosent get old over years,One of disneys all time best film is now one of the best dvd's ever. The film is one of disney's best goldena ge films. As some of it's old films get old over time this one dose not. the film is the most emotion film ever made and will still put tears in your eys. One of disneys best films is great to watch over and over again espesially with this great new dvd edition.
1,Movie is horrible when compared to modern films,"Movie is overrated by customers. The movie might of been good back then but compared to the movies now, it is horrible. Lion king has a similar plot and is much much better. I made a mistake buying this film. Now I have to sell it to someone. I am probably spoiled by the great technology of the modern animation films but don't expect this movie to even compare to the modern animation films now."
3,I can't see much difference in the blu ray,"With the exception of Bambi's mother being shot and killed and the forest fire and the quail being shot, and the dogs viscously attacking the deer, (wow this is a violent movie!) Well aside from all of that, it's a great movie, but it's an old movie and it's hard to enhance the quality of the picture, so for me at least I didn't notice much difference. So keep you old primitive (regular) dvd, save the blu ray money and take the kids out for a hamburger!"
5,I've Only Watched This 8 Times Since Purchased,"I think the spirit of Walt Disney came down to earth to inspire this wonderful DVD. Beautifully creative. I hesitate to use the word ""charming"" as that would downgrade how wonderful it is. It inspired me to buy the book ""Bambi"" and order the original VHS tape. I can't wait to get and watch it.And by the way . . . . . . I'm 60 years old, however the child in me still runs strong."
5,ninacece@webtv.net,"Pls, Long time I look for video tape the Bambi, I went many place but I can't find. Can you help me?Thank you very muchMarciaSan Diego, California"
2,Seldom selected for viewing.,"This old Disney Classic gets lost among all the other movies for families that have a more upbeat story. We rank this 31 out of the 41 Disney Animated movies that we own. Once it was seen, the kids seldom selected this one to watch again."
4,"Bambi, the visual look","I on the other hand, liked the fact that they didn't have the owl singing the twitterpated song. It simply seems corny to me, and out of character with the rest of the film. I disagree with most of the reviews here when they say the brigher colours were a plus. The DVD version of Beauty and The Beast has the same ""plus"" which actually killed the dark mood of the film. In Bambi's case, the bright colours gave it a more kiddish feel to it - the colours almost cartoonish instead of that rich realism we get from the origonal. But then that's just my preference. If you like bright colours... which most little kids do, you'll like this DVD version."
5,One of the best,I think of all the Disney classics this one is top 3. It's such a great movie and the story is beautiful. So cute!!
5,Art on the Screen,"This movie, especially in the new blu ray edition is truly work of art. The forest scenes are surreal and beautifully lit. We enjoyed the ""Disney View"" presentation with scene-coordinated artwork replacing the black side curtains on our HD tv with the 4:3 proportioned movie.The story never gets old; still very bittersweet. Our 4 grandcildren (5 to 12) loved it."
3,"Not ""The Incredibles""","Although the animation is incredible. In fact, Walt Disney's gorgeously drawn paean to Nature is one of the most beautiful animated films ever made. And there are important Life lessons to be learned here as well, about love, loss, growth etc. Kids weaned on ""The Incredibles"" and ""Finding Nemo,"" however, might be a bit bored. There's no plot to speak of, the music is corny, the humor quaint. Older kids in particular will probably want to switch to ""Spider-Man 2"" or their Nintendo. To be honest, as an adult Disney fan I much prefer ""Pinocchio"" and ""Dumbo"" from this period, both of which have great humor, plot and lots and lots of heart. (And they're beautifully animated as well.) My humble opinion: ""Bambi"" is obviously an important and significant achievement in animation. It's sweet, pretty to look at, but that's about all."
5,All the big ones,"If you want the best of the best, then this is it. Every hit that the group put out and there are plenty of them. Worth buying this one."
2,"Yet another mis-titled ""Very Best Of"" album","Yet another attempt to re-write history and ignore the pre-Rumours era of the band. To truly be called The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac, you would have to include at least, Black Magic Woman, Oh Well, Sentimental Lady and Hypnotized. There are many more quintessential songs from the pre-Buckingham/Nicks era that should be included, but those four were in heavy FM rotation in the early 70's. They exposed the band to a huge audience, which made their commercial breakthrough in 1975 possible. To exclude them and then title this release a ""best of"" is criminal."
1,Don't buy this !,There is background noise. Very poor reproduction. The thing doesn't open up easily. It took great effort to open it using media player. The last two tracks on disk 1 have serious recording flaws. It's a piece of s_ _ _.Some of the tracks have skipping.
5,The ultimate Rock-n-Roll band.,"For anybody who is a Fleetwood Mac fan, and for those who are unfamiliar with the band this cd is a must have. On this cd you will find most of the hits plus a few great songs that weren't played on radio much. In my opinion Fleetwood Mac is the greatest Rock band of all time, and in this day and age when music is so manufactured I am thankful that they are still playing. This is a great collection and should wet the appetite for the new album they are in the studio making right now."
2,Better to listen tht,"I got this only because I am an ultimate Fleetwood Mac fan. Unfortunately, it is rather a rip off. Stevie's SILVER SPRING is not the original with Lindsey and Christine backing her up - they were completely eliminated. I'm glad I have THE CHAIN import box set - there is certainly more of a selection and it includes alternative versions. Also, some of the ""live"" versions are really on the DVD/Video of ""The Dance""."
5,"As always, Fleetwood Mac is the best.",This is a great 2 cd set and has most if not all of Mac's greatest hits over the years....
5,A Masterpiece,"300 hundred passaged of wisdom from a man who truly sought out to understand human nature. Gracian developed sublime and cunning ways to defend oneself from the inherent greed, lust and vanity of humankind, while still yet, seeking out the best in people and aiming to preserve social harmony. Nothing can be said about this book that hasn't already been observed and said my the great minds that bare its appreciation. I highly recommend this book for anyone seeking to improve and understand the social matrix of this world. If understood and applied correctly, it may greatly increase your effectiveness in LIFE."
4,Descent overview of Psychology,This is a good overview for a quick review of everything you should have learned in a psychology curriculum.
4,"Nice pendant, strange chain","The pendant is cool with great design. But the chain's color is much lighter than the pendant's, which makes it a little weird when I put it on."
1,To theatrical,"Not what i was expecting. Melancholy Beast is one of the best metal albums i've ever heard from beginninng to end. Usually the the sophomore effort rarely lives up to the first, but this doesn't even come close to Melancholy Beast. The keyboards/percussions overpower the music. There are no great riffs and the music lacks attitude and crunch. I just didn't like the direction this album went too. i tried to give it a chance, needless to say its gone to my cd boneyard."
4,Bit of a Mixed Bag,"I wanted to love this since I'm a diehard Zevon fan, but while I enjoy it immensely, I don't feel it's Zevon at his best. The sound is muddy for starters..perhaps this is a concious decision and if so, it doesn't work. Much like the sound on Mutineer was poor.There are some good moments here but nothing that hits as hard and as well as the songs on ""Life'll Kill Ya"". That's the far better record...although I really do like the title song. I'm hoping Warren hits it out of the park with what will sadly be his farewell album."
2,Mondo Head,"As a devotee and lover of taiko music I awaited the release of Kodo's newest CD for months. Kodo has ventured in this release away from the traditional sounds of taiko into a genre that is many types of African, Middle Eastern, and other drumming forms.I was sadly disappointed. I hope that Kodo returns to what brought them into the forefront of taiko drumming in it's timed honored traditions."
5,Kodo Fan,"I love just about everything by Kodo. How to describe the experience is really beyond words. Because I love to dance and this music is made to move to I just love it. I crawl right inside and it lifts me up. It takes me places. It's very meditative, primative and lovely please just buy it. You'll know what I mean when you get it."
4,I don't have it... just a thought,"I was thinking, if you got this, beware, don't put ALL the money in there or else if one time you needed money, you couldn't get any of your own money!(Just a thought)"
4,I remember them.,"I'm not sure why, but I always liked ""Skid Row"" a little more than the rest of the bunch. Maybe it's because they spent more time on rocking, and less time on makeup. This is an excellent debut, and one of the few rock albums that I can play straight through. All these songs are good, but the better ones are the anthem ""Youth Gone Wild"", the awesome ""18 And Life"", and one of the best ballads from the era ""I Remember You"". Overall, I think this one is up there with ""Slippery When Wet"" and ""Appetite For Destruction"", and kind of a cross between the two."
5,Skid Row delivers with this album and it's a classic!!,"Skid Row had a winning formula with this album and showcases Sebastian Bach's vocals at its best and this group found success in the late 80s- but not the same level as Poison, Motley Crue and Guns N' Roses. Skid Row's Slave To The Grind was the first metal album to ever top the chart. Motley Crue topped the album chart with Dr. Feelgood and Guns N' Roses topped the chart with Appetite for Destruction- perhaps one of the greatest metal albums of all-time. Skid Row found mainstram success with the #1 single, 18 & Life and #2 ""I Remember You"". Youth Gone Wild and Piece of Me are two the best songs on the album.Skid Row delivers this album.As for the new album, Thickskin, avoid!!There is no Skid Row without Sebastian Bach.Sebastian Bach was Skid Row and the new Skid Row won't have the same success.Skid Row's debut is a classic."
1,quit working and no recourse,"i purchased this little fridge for my office. after about 8 monthes, it just stopped working. i called amazon, who told be to call igloo, who told me to call curtis international and about 40 minutes later i finally got someone on the phone. i got someone in india who refused to give me an address where i could ship it to until i gave him my credit card info. he kept outlinging charges ($7 for insurance, $35.00 for parts, etc) and wouldn't give me an address until he had my credit card info. i didn't trust him, and i won't buy another igloo or curtis product."
2,HORRIBLE,"I've only had this unit 2 months and it's already non-functioning. As someone else mentioned it gets REALLY warm on the exterior (mainly in the back where everything is exposed) -- hot to be exact, which is why it's probably no longer cooling on the inside -- apparently it overheated and conked out. Needless to say, I will be returning this to the manufacturer for a warranty service or exchange. What a waste of time and money! VERY dissapointed as I NEVER have a problem like this with things I purchase from Amazon."
1,Horrible Product - Please Dont Buy,"This is the first product ive had to return at Amazon cos it was defective... in the sense, it did not work for even one second... Thinkin it could just be one defective piece, i checked online... and everyone had the exact same complaint about the product... So, now im forced to believe that this refrigerator is just one piece of crap."
1,Wrong book received,"I ordered this book twice from Amazon and both times received the wrong book, the cover was correct but the text was from a different book. Both were returned, credit received. I had the same experience when I ordered this same book twice from Alibris."
1,all his phone numbers donot work. no clue how to order life health. very upsetting,numbers do not work. no clue how to order life health. very up setting. ripped off.re rod linder weight loss.
1,3 faulty pads in a row,Within a couple weeks the down arrow started failing. Amazon quickly replaced the pad with the same results. Then we had to return the 3rd pad for the same reason. Something is seriously wrong.
3,revolution dance pad,"My kids loved this pad. Sadly, I will be sending this item back yet another time. I originally bought this for my daughters for Christmas. It lasted about 2 weeks, one of the things on the pad doesn't work. Now they say it is broken yet again. I'm going to just ask for a refund. The dance pad that came with the actual x-box cd works fine. This one, which the kids say is thicker--keeps breaking!"
2,Fatal Error,"This was a great dance pad for about two days. After the second day, the down arrow would not register any button presses during a song. It would work fine every for every other use, except when pressing it in order to clear a song. Also, Naki's phone number provided at their website (nakiusa.com) is out of service."
3,Just ok,Bought these for playing soccer in colder months while still being able to wear gloves while taking a throw in. No super warm nor super grippe. Be better than nothing.
4,Move to Move Still Moves ME!,"This is a cool CD. I am a big fan of the song ""IBeg Your Pardon"", and ""Puss N Boots"", I pretty much grew up with that stuff. However, i thought there would be another song on this album, I'm not sure of the title but it kinda goes, ""Oh,OH,Oh, Oh Baby, DO you wanna dance with me?, Oh, Oh, Oh,Oh, baby, Dance the night ? "", Anyways it is probably on the other Kon Kan CD. Other than that the whole CD is pretty catchy, definately 80's dance pop stuff. If you wanna break out the flashback vault, you should definately have this in your CD collection."
4,Does the job nicely,In a pinch for time in the morning but need a little caffeine jolt. This is the product. Also perfect for making a small serving as an evening pick-me-up without risking sleeplessness. Tasty.
2,Muy confusing,"I've never seen such a confusing interface for educational software. Helpful in some areas, but using electronic flashcards where you mentally recall words and then have to see if you're right yourself is pretty lame. The software actually displays ""Were you right?"" and then you respond to keep your score. Another case of ""You get what you pay for"" I guess!"
1,Cute,We recieved this from my mother when our son was born. She knew how much I adored Classic Pooh. Its cute and all but my son is now four months old and he really is not interested in it. It does not hold his attetion at all! If you have cats they will absolutely love it! Mine like to bat at his tail! Save your money for another style.
3,Looking for more,"This book is good for a beginner, but that's it. I bought Encore a month ago, and just now received this book from when I pre-ordered it. So now that I have had a month to play with Encore without any books, I have picked up the basics pretty easily because I am use to other Adobe interfaces. I wanted more in depth about Motion Menus. There is one chapter in here on it, and it just brushes over it. I want examples and tutorials. This book doesn't come with a cd. Basically it just gets you started, but I am looking to create complex motion menus, and this doesn't help me too much."
5,"Barbie Doll Fashion Vol. II, 1968-1974","Sarah's second book is an extremely useful and comprehensive guide to Barbie's wonderful world of fashion. The book covers the Mod era, and includes high-quality photos of every outfit, right down to earrings and purses. I loved how it didn't just cover Barbie fashion, but also her friends Ken, Francie, Skipper, PJ, etc. It would be an excellent addition to your Barbie book collection."
4,Good but repetative,"As many other reviewers have pointed out, the book is extremely authoritative on it's subject matter, and ""shatters"" a lot of old misunderstandings about the battle. However, it does have a serious flaw in that the authors definitely needed stronger editing. The writing is clear but they repeat the same points many times, and spend several paragraphs explaining something that was obvious after a sentence or two."
4,Shattered Sword. The Untold Story of the Battle of Midway,"Good book. Gives technical details why the author comes to the conclusions that he does. Found the facts that were revealed to be quite interesting,"
2,Pro's and Con's,"This product sometimes promotes better sleep for me, and other times hinders it. I have used it now for about 2 months and have awakened many mornings to a sore neck and back. You need a larger sized bed if you sleep with your partner (Queen or better) since it's size is fairly large. The cost is much too high. It states that it supports your back - it does not. For the price, it should support everthing - mainly and mostly your back and belly. It is not made of very durable material and has already begun to flatten out. You can wash the outside cover as a bonus, but I would not suggest washing the pillow itself. Therefore, if you were to soil it, you would be out of luck. Not a very good buy for your time, sleep and money. My suggestion would be to shop around in stores so that you can feel and inspect it prior to purchasing."
1,More of a hassle than a help...,"I tried this a few nights before it got ole' heave-ho! It did not help me at all. I was better off with the regular pillow between my legs. I don't know why it didn't work for me, but it didn't. It was uncomfortable and hard to roll from side-to-side with. And it takes up so much space.... Don't recommend this at all... especially for the price."
1,It gives me neck and shoulder pain after using it for a while,"It seemed to work well for the first few weeks. Then I started having pain in the neck and shoulder. If you could ask someone to take a look at your neck and spine, you would notice that they aren't in a straight line when you are using the pillow. The material doesn't contour to your neck and head. The pain went away after I switched back to my old pillow and using a pillow between my knees and ankles. The cover that comes with the pillow is made in a poor material.I bought this because I was a back sleeper and was desperate in finding a solution to help me sleep on my side. THE BOTTOM LINE: I won't suggest it to any one or buy it again."
2,"Too big, too pricey","I purchased this pillow and have never successfully slept through an entire night with it. It is really quite large and feels confining when wrapped all around you under the sheets. I felt like I couldn't move and couldn't get comfortable. Plus, the material is really scratchy and awful - forcing you to shell out additional money for a cover. Way over-priced. Mine sits in the corner of my bedroom. For $20 I bought a body pillow and ultra soft cover at Target and I love it and sleep with it every night. Save your money!"
5,Great gift for my pregnant friend!,"My best friend is pregnant and has been having a horrible time sleeping lately because she is always uncomfortable. My sister in law told me about this pillow and I bought it for my friend to try out. She's had it a week now and loves it, it has greatly improved her sleep. In fact, after about 10 minutes with the pillow when my friend went to the bathroom, she came back to find her fiancee curled up with it so I guess there are two fans of the pillow in the house."
2,Would not recommend,"I purchased this pillow early on in my pregnancy, and it worked well for the first few months. However, I found that the pillow really flattened out with use, and I eventually just switched to using multiple regular pillows in order to get enough support. I am not a large person either (115 pounds before pregnancy), so it didn't take much. Once I made that switch to regular pillows, I found the multiple pillows were much easier to maneuver around. Now that I am in the final weeks and turning is really difficult, I would not go back to the snoogle at all."
4,"Guys, do this for your wife!","somewhere around week 22 of prego, my wife's back and hips start to get really sore, and she was having trouble sleeping. The snoogle came to the rescue. help level her hips at night, which made her back muscles much happier."
5,The Best Pregnancy Pillow Ever,"I started to feel a little uncomfortable around five and a half months, so I thought I'd give this pillow a try. It's rather big, but it doesn't take up as much room as using 3 or 4 pillows would. My husband and I have a full bed and with the Snoogle added to the mix we still sleep comfortably at night. The pillow wraps underneath your head and around to your back, which supports your back, then comes between your knees, which also releives pressure on your back, and lastly fits snuggly underneath your drooping tummy. . .it's perfect! I highly recommend this Snoogle for any pregnant woman who's starting to get a big belly =)"
2,Not was I was hoping for,I am a little disappointed in the pillow. I have trouble getting comfortable using it as a pillow for my head. If you have a small bed I wouldn't recommend on getting this because it is pretty big.
3,Ok,At first this was uncomfortable and took a few days for my body to adjust. I had neck pains for a couple of days but the pillow finally flattened out a bit. I am used to the pillow now and use it every night. At times my legs still need to move around and I don't usually sleep through the night. I thought it was not worth the price considering there's no cover for it. I'm sure a regular body pillow works just as well.
4,Should have bought it earlier,"I love my Snoogle and should have bought it earlier. It is expensive for a pillow, but getting a nights rest is priceless. All of my non-pregnant friends and my husband want to steal it.As some earlier reviews have mentioned, the fabric cover is cheap and scratchy. I put a regular pillow case over the part that touches my head and that's made it comfortable.There is room for improvement, but overall an excellent purchase and I highly recommend it for pregnant ladies!"
5,Best Sleep Ever!,"This body pillow is perfect for helping you sleep comfortably. Even if I wasn't pregnant, I would still use this pillow. It's just firm enough, has a great shape, and can mold into many other shapes depending on how you like to sleep. It's also great if you're a stomach sleeper, just roll up the pillow around you belly. Also great for getting back massages as you can mold it to fit your head and belly at the same time to allow you to lay on your stomach. Best purchase ever!"
5,Luv it!,This is my 3rd pregnancy.... I wish I knew about this amazing pillow sooner!!!!! I actually slept 12hr my first night using this pillow... that hasn't happened since before my kids were born :)Luv it! Every pregnant woman should own one.
5,Finally got a good nights rest!!,"I am 7 months preganant and received this as a gift from my boss last night. Used it for the first time, and woke up feeling the best I have felt in months. The head support is great, and the bottom of the pillow can go under my belly so it doesn't feel like I am getting stretched out when I lay down. I would definitely reccomend this product."
5,Very satisfied,"I started using this pillow relatively early on in my pregnancy and am still using it now at 39 weeks. It has really been a fantastic sleep aid. It has helped keep me on my side, props my leg up for back pain relief, and has also served as my primary head pillow. I even brought it to Hawaii with me last month, I just couldn't imagine sleeping without it.I did have to buy a wedge pillow to put under my belly, but the combination of the two pillows leave me with little to no back pain upon waking. Also, I recommend highly buying a couple of Snoogle slip covers. I didn't know about them until recently, but wish I had."
4,Helped a little,This pillow does help me sleep most nights. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because it is so big and bulky. It feels like I'm wrestling an alligator when I want to roll over!
3,"Close, but still missing the mark","This is my third pregnancy and 4th child. Unfortunately I threw out the good body pillow I had with my other two pregnancies not knowing I would later be blessed with a fourth child. I am now desperately trying to find it. This one is close, but still misses the mark because1.) While the shape is great and gives you losts of sleeping options the pillow itself is thin---not quite wide enough and I'm 5'9 125 lbs (prepregnancy) so I still end up using additional pillows to support myself with this pillow.2.) The fill is not good. It goes flat in sections which needless to say isn't good.If the only option is this pillow or using 3-4 of your own at home, I'd vote for using 3-4 of your own at home.I threw this one out after 1 week."
2,Snoogle not for everyone,"I almost feel like i didnt give this enough time since most others love it. It is nice and soft and snuggly. But, after two nights of using it I had to return it. I tried to sleep with the top curve under my head as a pillow and I woke up with a horribly stiff neck. I am used to a thinner pillow so I think it was just to thick for me. I tried to use it with my regular pillow the next night and the top curve just kept getting in the way. I was more comfy but couldnt stand the top hitting me in the head all night. I exchanged it for a regular body pillow and now I sleep much better. The price is also bit much for teh Snoogle as well ($50 at Babies R US). I got my body pillow for $10 at Bed Bath and Beyond.Bottom line, could be great for those who can sleep with their head on the Snoogle. Otherwise get a regular body pillow."
4,Loved it starting the 6th month,"My hubby got me this when I was only 3 months pregnant. At that time I didn't appreciate the snoogle yet. It pretty much stayed on the floor and I used pillows instead.When I started to get big...around 5.5 months, I really started appreciating the Snoogle! Now that I'm in my 7th month I can't even imagine how I'd sleep without it. I am literally 'snoogling' up to this pillow every night.Since I've had it for a while now I'd had the opportunity to wash it several times and although it is softer - it's nothing close to my sheets.If you're concerned about the price...think about the value of your sleep. I value my sleep and am glad I can enjoy my rest now before the baby comes."
5,Best pregnancy purchase...buy one now!!!,"I thought this pillow was a little overpriced when I ordered it, but it has been worth EVERY penny. I ordered it around my 5th month of pregnancy and have slept with it every night since. It is so comfortable and fits just fine in in our queen size bed. I was sleeping on my side with it, but with increasing heartburn over the past few weeks I have started wrapping the snoogle behind my back to sleep with my head elevated. This thing is a lifesaver. Also, I didn't realize this when I ordered it, but it actually comes with a removable pillowcase so unless you want it a specific color or pattern, don't waste your money on the pillowcases!"
3,Worked well for pregnancy,"This worked well for my pregnancy and I didn't mind it breaking down over time. Now that I am no longer pregnant I actually DO mind that it broke down. So it is okay, and worth it while you are pregnant, but it isn't really for a daily use multi-year or multi-pregnancy pillow."
4,Snoogle Rocks!,This pillow is definatley worth it later in the pregnancy. When you can't get comfortable at all this pillow is a life saver. I preferred to use it more when I was laying around watching tv or resting verses while I slept. I was able to control laying on back so no need for it while sleeping. Highly recommend!
4,"Very comfy overall, a bit firm for the head","I bought this pillow about 3 weeks ago and it has helped immensely with my back. At almost 7 months pregnant, I just couldn't get comfortable and decided to try the Snoogle. It provides great support for my back and between my knees and feet.The only downside is that it is too firm for my head and would hurt my ears after a while. Hence, 4 starts instead of 5. I added a piece of 2"" egg crate foam under a regular pillowcase and that seemed to fix the issue."
4,"Very good, not perfect","At around 15 weeks I started having terrible lower back pain when I slept, and the maternity pillow I used for my first pregnancy did not help at all. This pillow, while not completely relieving my back pain, has considerably reduced it. I still wake up feeling stiff and a little sore, but it goes away quickly. I also like that this pillow's profile is narrow enough that my husband can fit in our (queen-sized) bed without fear of falling off the edge. at 5'1'' there's plenty of pillow to go around, and I appreciate being able to position it in different ways. The pillow cover material isn't great, but it's not something I really care about. All in all, I would (cautiously) recommend this."
4,Best pillow ever!!!,"I absolutely love this pillow! I have only used it for one night, but I woke up this morning rested and best of all PAIN FREE!! I am 30 weeks pregnant and I have recently been experiencing a lot of hip and back pain. I was using a traditional body pillow with no relief. I love the fact that I can use this pillow in the bed for nursing. I remember with my daughter I had to use about six pillows and the Boppy to feed her comfortably. I feel confident with this pillow I can use it and maybe the Boppy to feed in the bed comfortably. The only complaint I have with this pillow is that I can't use my traditional pillow as well, but all in all that's not a deal breaker for me. I highly recommend this pillow for moms to be and for breastfeeding/co-sleeping moms."
2,Not life-altering like I'd hoped,"I was so excited to get this pregnancy pillow - I'd been told over and over again by friends and my midwife that I just had to get a pregnancy pillow, that I'd feel so much better once I did.Alas, that didn't happen.My major two issues with this pillow are this:- It's hot. Or, rather, it traps my heat, so I wake up much sweatier than I do without it. I don't particularly like being hot while sleeping, so I rarely use this as a result.- It's awkward when rolling over. I have to reposition myself to make it work, which means that I need to kinda sorta wake up to do so, rather than just readjusting while sleeping like I'd normally do.I also wish the pillowcases for it were cheaper - I can't see investing more money into this to use it more than I do, but because I end up kicking it to the floor midway through each night I try to use it, I would like something that's easier to clean.Mostly, I wish that I hadn't spent the money."
1,Not worth the money whatsoever,I bought this pillow because of back problems with my pregnancy. I don't toss and turn but I do tend to roll over once or twice at night. This does not provide the support to my lower back that I need nor does it allow you to rest easily. I had to wake up to roll over each time because the pillow does not allow you to turn easily. My husband was also upset by the size of the pillow because it took up a lot of room in our King size bed. I don't know about you but a pregnant woman and a giagantic pillow don't leave too much room for dad! I wish I could make a recommedation on another pillow to use instead of this - but the truth is that this discouraged me from trying any other pregnancy pillow - so I sleep with regular pillows again.
4,"A little confusing, but worth the $$","My husband bought this for me at 24 weeks because he said I looked uncomfortable when I was sleeping. I find the pillow takes up a lot of space, but I do sleep better with it. It definitely stays between my knees unlike the pillows I was using. I don't use the top as my pillow (curl it around my regular pillow), so it doesn't quite snuggle up to me the way it was intended. After using it for 8 weeks, i just figured out how to get some extra support from my stomach from the pillow. The pillow has kept it's shape well and I am definitely sleeping better. Now if I could just stop those middle of the night bathroom trips, I could sleep soundly through the night."
2,Good for naps but not all night,"I bought this pillow and was very excited about it as I have always been a stomach sleeper and staying on my side was a real challenge. I slept with it for about two weeks and though some nights I would stay in position most others I would have to reposition the pillow several times. Not too much of a problem. I haven't slept straight through the night since I got pregnant. About 1/2 way through the 2nd week I started getting excrutiating headaches. I finally went to the doctor and she stated that they were caused from stress and strain. Turns out I spent the better part of sleeping hours ""fighting"" with the pillow to change position. I quit using it at night and my headaches have gone away completely. It is great for taking naps where your less likely to toss & turn. And I love it for laying in bed and reading. It's still better than having 6 pillows on the bed but I don't recommend it for people who naturally shift a lot in their sleep."
2,meh!,I've had this pillow for 3 weeks and I am still not convinced.it does kind of help but I still find myself laying on the other side.Not as comfortable as I thought it would be.
5,Finally - a good night's sleep!,I was having a terrible time adjusting to the increasing size of my belly along with trying to sleep. My husband ordered this pillow for me in hopes that it would help. I am so glad that he found this product. I have been able to sleep ever since the snoogle pillow arrived. Pregnancy is exhausting enough without having trouble sleeping. I highly recommend this product to expectant moms.
2,Didn't work for me,I found the snoogle to be bulky and not help me sleep better at all. I felt like I wasted money on this product. I ended up just putting a regular pillow between my legs and that helped a lot more than the snoogle did.
3,Great If You Have The Space,I found it very difficult to sleep on my side when I first got pregnant. So when I saw this item I didn't hesitate to buy it. It got a lot of use for about 5 months. My husband complained that it took up to much room in our king sized bed. Once I washed the cover I could never get it to go back on completely. I found it easier to put a pillow between legs and chest area during the last two months of my pregnancy.
2,Thought it would be better,"It's a great idea that seems like it would solve the issue of sleeping while pregnant, but it was actually harder to use. For example, if you lay with the long piece behind your back, you cannot roll over very easily.The pillow is firm-ish which some may like, and the material it is made of is soft to the touch. The pillow is quite large and takes up a substantial portion of the bed. I ended up returning this item (very easily thanks to Amazon) and bought a small wedge pillow for my belly and use a separate small pillow for between the legs.Material: 4/5Quality: 4/5Usability: 1/5Overall: 2/5"
4,great pillow,"I got this pillow for my sister who is 5+ months pregnant, she has been sleeping much better and is very happy to have received a product that actually provides comfort."
4,"A necessity - love the snoogle, hate the cover","This was an absolute necessity for my last pregnancy! It helped support me and keep me comfortable in bed and keep me from rolling on my back. Before I bought this, I was waking constantly with aches and pains. I'm now pregnant again, and it is very supportive even before my belly has become huge. The only drawback, is the very cheap cover that is not nearly as soft as a pillowcase should be and pills terribly. I'm going to attempt to make my own cover out of a nice high thread count sheet."
4,Good Pregnancy Pillow,"Got this pillow after way too many sleepless nights. I had been having alot of hip and back pain related to Sciatica and needed something to help me stay on my sides. I love the pillow for going behind my back and keeping me from rolling over, but my belly isn't big enough to really use it on the other side. I have tried this pillow sitting up for reading, and eventually for feeding, and LOVE it. The only issues I have with it are right on with the other reviews ~ the cover is really hard to get on. The benefits out weigh the negatives though!"
2,I can't actually believe the translation of this,"Jeffrey Hopkins - as we all know - is an extraordinary translator.Here we have a text by Mip'am Rinpoche, commented by that extraordinary scholar and yogin, HH Khetsün Sangpo Rinpoche, and yet the translation gives you nothing.I really hate to criticise a translator worth me to the power ten, but to translate dharmakaya as 'body of characteristics' and then - a few paragraphs on - point out (in the voice of Mip'am Rinpoche) that the characteristic of the body of characteristics is to be utterly devoid of characteristics strikes me as... sad, actually.I know what you're trying to say - even know why you're saying it like this... And, bowing at your feet, I apologise."
2,Missing actual text,"I was all hyped up to receive this HUGE book with so much in it. It wasn't anything near what I expected. More like what you'd get in a beginning of a class. ""Today we will teach you all about how to ...."" and a very min. beginning lesson with much of that missing as well. There were pictures of projects not even discussed within its pages. Glorified advertisement for Michael's maybe? Anyways I really was expecting much more then what I got. This book is a huge let down."
4,Great for Beginners or Veterans,Steve Schiffman gives a quality effort in overcoming the myriad of objections that any sales representative faces. His practical approach deserves applause. I would recommend this for anyone just learning the ropes of the sales process or the road warrior who needs to brush up on his or her skills.
3,Generic Cable!,"Just as one of the other reviewers stated, this is a generic cable and not a Sony Ericsson DCU-60. The cable does do what it's supposed to, however, this borders on ""False Advertising""."
2,Good product; so-so customer service,"The product works as intended. However when I first could not get it to work w/ my phone and iMAC and asked the sellers for advice, the simple answer I got was ""you should contact Apple or Sony"". At least they responded, I suppose. It took me a while to figure out why it was not connecting (needs Windows OS)."
4,Good,I got this product and have only used it three times. But it works perfect. I know it will just end up in my junk cable drawer but it served its purpose
3,Deliver us from Evie,"Parr's sister Evie dresses in masculine clothes, likes to fix machines and finds herself crushing on Patsy, the banker's daughter. Despite the stigma of being labeled as a lesbian, Evie find strength in herself and moves away to live with Patsy. Overall, I thought the characters and storyline was overly stereotypical. I'm not sure if a teenager would respond better to the book, but I found it to be a bit slow and static."
5,Finally -- the truth!,"If I had to choose just one book for an overview of how real science supports Genesis rather than Darwin, this would be it. Dr. Huse covers an amazing amount of territory in relatively short order, using language that anyone can understand. Highly recommended!"
3,An excellent example of creationist scholarship,"In his attempt to discredit evolution, Huse makes use of virtually every half-truth and outright fabrication that creationists have promulgated over the past thirty years. While the end result is unreliable (the platypus as a transitional between birds and mammals?) and vitriolic, it's an interesting view into the mind of a creationist shepherd-- the sheep being those who accept Huse's nonsense at face value."
4,"Nice mellow sound, but high tension","Ernie Ball Earthwood 80/20 Bronze Medium (13-56) strings have a full and nice mellow sound that I really like. Unfortunately, as heavy gauge strings they require a lot of tension to tune up. I am used to light and extra light strings, so I have tuned these 2 half notes low, (i.e. E string tuned to D, etc.) to reduce tension, but they are still hard on the fingers to play. I will look for a lighter version of the Earthwood strings, to try to get the same full yet mellow sound without the high string tension."
2,Window film,Was very hard to take the film from the attached paper. Even with two people trying to do it without it sticking to the film. Have used other film that was much easier to apply. Would not recommend it for the cost.
4,Fascinating Food for Thought,"The reader is impressed with author Miller's wide familiarity with Western literature (I had sold Jane Austen short)in making his points as well as his ability to employ an analytical legal mind to question ""conventional wisdom"" - even taking on Jesus's teachings in this regard. Miller's willingness to examine his own motives and inclinations to ""fake it"" are refreshing. Such self examination gives the book a sense of legitimacy and veracity. I would have liked to see more in-depth discussion of the the search for the ""self."" Still, the book has value as a guide to establishing (and recognizing) authenticity - an important characteristic of mental health. By the end of the book, I was getting a slight sense of a parsing of the subject a bit too finely - like the Chaucer character he mentioned who could divide flatulence into parts for analysis. But this effort is much more than hot air or showing off. I left it with valuable insights into myself, and Professor Miller."
1,Faking it,"This is a really bad book. It applies a few generic psychoanalytic insights to everything, borrows heavily from Zizek in places, especially in its reflections on Judaism, without anywhere acknowledging the debt, and the ""wry wit"" is not that witty at all, but indulgent and infinitely self-regarding. The relation between Faking It's clever cover and its preening, self-pleasuring insides is one of pure, authentic fakery."
3,Way way out of date,"I failed to notice the copyright date when I bought this book -- 1996. So much has changed since then, and many rail trails aren't included. I think it was good for its day, but it needs to be updated."
1,Cheaply made controls,It never worked right and I felt it was a waste of money.I expected much better from the Kitchen Aid brand.My sister got one like it and hers didn't work right either.
1,Way Too Predictable!,"The movie ""Rebound"" is like fantasy because a hot-shot coach wouldn't teach his old school. It would be like Randy Moss when he retires going to coach for the his old high school team."
5,One of the Best Cds Ever,"I am a music collector and own over 5 thousand cds. Few have captured my attention on the first listen like this cd has. I hope Diego reads this review. I don't know why his cds are so hard to come by, but even if this cd were 100 bucks (and it probably will be in a few months after it is out of circulation),I would still pay for it, and that is something I can say about vey frw cds. Each song is a gem,especially ""Donde Cruza La Frontera"" ,""La VIda Mata"" and the hidden song at the end. Keep up the good work DIego, and please, pretty please, release a few more units out in the market so that more people can be captivated by your music as I was."
5,Cool Band...,"I was never really exposed to the band 1927, but when I heard their single ""That's When I Think Of You"", I fell in love with it and I bought the album ""...Ish"", as recommended by my girlfriend. And all the other tracks just blew me away!!! Check it out!"
4,Amazon Order,"Book came very quickly in the mail! I have enjoyed reading this book so far. It has alot of great examples on tests and writing test questions. Very helpful and informative, but also easy to read!"
2,Not as advertised by manufacturer,"These are NOT ""double wall"" as described by manufacturer. The support is very very light. There are other varieties at less than half the price that are better..Nancy Ganz, Donna Karan and a sears line called ""subtract"" which are fabulous..if you can find them!Spanx makes some nice stuff..their Target line of camis are great and inexpensive. The high waisted body slimmers roll down even on small people..don't bother."
5,Great Workout,"I received this video as a gift and was hesitant, thinking that if I'm supposed to get into a pair of skinny jeans, this workout is going to hurt. It doesn't hurt at all, in fact the workout and stretches were wonderful. I suffer from chronic pain in my back, neck and hips and this work out helped me loosen up. I'm sure I will sleep better because of it. I love Molly, she is so present and explains with simplicity and elegance.Namaste"
2,Below average modelling - bad anatomy,"All Modelling concerns with this book aside, the biggest problem I have with 3-D Human Modeling and Animation is simply that the author's models are terrible examples of the human form.Not very impressive. If you see this book - just skip to the human face blend shapes section and see what I mean: ugly, anatomically incorrect shapes. This problem permiates through the whole publication. Don't let the cover image fool you (not the authors.)If you are new to character/organic modelling, I do not recommend this book. If your'e a little more experienced, there's a few chapters here that inspire especially later in the book. I found the reference section on hair shader variations quite handy."
3,Cool!,"A great reference. The author is a little short at times when you need more.Buy a DVD instead, so you can see all the steps. I purchased ""Organic modeling-1"" from freedom of Teach by Tareq Marza.If you know nothing about human anatomy, uh oh. Go back to the beginning. Learn to draw first. That's just from my experience.I had to start from zero. Trying to model a human character you know nothing about is torture. I'm all better now.Riven Phoenix ""The Structure Of Man"" can help you in this regard.Nice try but, lacks a bit."
3,good book,"Bought this book for class. It took almost 2 weeks to arrive. However, it was a good book. Very insightful!"
2,A disappointment.,"I love this Murder, She Wrote series. Every book is enjoyable and can be read in one sitting---except this one. The only mystery here is the reason this book was written. It started out great and had a reasonable plot---but at the end, it offered no answers! I felt cheated in a way. Normally, I like spy novels and stories, but they at least give you some of the answers---this book doesn't even give you one! While all of the other Murder, She Wrote books are great, this one is the one to miss."
2,Entertaining but inaccurate,"Although this book has many attractive illustrations, the author's failure to give the sources for any of the images he has redrawn makes it useless as documentation of particular fashions. His descriptions are so worthless as to border on the laughable, and his redrawings are heavily influenced by art and fashion of the 1920's, when it was written. Do not buy this book if you are looking for accurate information on ancient and classical costume."
5,Lovely magical story,Great book for kids of 14 and under. Father and motherless son in NY city find their troubled way with help from a great community of eccentric people who show the boy the power of belief and hope.
4,soft stuffie,"This is a cute and soft little elephant (8in high), but it is defintely more of a girl's toy with pink inside the ears, shiney silver bow (can't be seen in picture) and shiney silver star on the left foot."
2,Worst Game Ever!,"This is the most boring and poorest quality game I have ever played. Even if you get it to work on your DVD player, you'll be disappointed. Good thing I only payed $5 for it at chapters. And yet, I want my money back..."
5,Very Exciting!,"This book was very exciting! I got it and finished it in just a few hours! Now I can't wait untill June, when the next book comes out. The Mandie books are the best books ever"
4,Good Toy,"My 21 month old received this as a christmas gift. She loves it. She identifies the songs with the Barney tv show that she watches. She doesn't really care much for the microphone, but the toy overall is a great purchase if your child loves Barney."
3,"3.5 stars really, not soooo bad....",Ya' it has that 80's/Top Gun/Kenny Loggins sound...but the fact remains that these are still pretty good songs. My guess is that this CD will become harder to find as the years pass. You may want to pick it up while it's still cheap. Pay no attention to the negative review of this CD it's still worth the listen.
4,Good little machine,"Machine arrived in good condition. Quick hookup. Seems to work fairly well. Drying function is inadequate, but if you let dishes sit in machine for a while they fast dry. Think the dryer button is not working properly, but can't tell. This may be normal for the machine. Racks to hold dishes can not be filled. If you put as many dishes as there are spaces, the dishes will not come out clean. Also make sure you put silverware with service end up, or they may not get cleaned.Will reserve further coment until I see what happens.I got this machine, because I am having a redo to my kitchen and there will be no sink to clean dishes in, shortly. This serves as a viable option to disposable cookware. Hopefully the machine lasts long enough till I get a new sink installed. May be a year. I'll have to wait and see."
1,LEAKED AND DIED,The unit started leaking and then quit functioning after about a year. Up to then it worked okay.
1,Lasted less than a year,"Fist the door broke, then the front panel, then the drain hose, then the pump. I love having a dishwasher, but this one has been nothing but trouble."
1,Might be good if you get one that works,"I just recieved my new dishwasher. It fills up with water, washes the dishes but wont drain. I guess the drain pump is broken. My multiple calls to the ""Haier Customer Satisfaction Center"" are unanswered. Looks like it would be an interesting invention if it worked."
1,Broke after a month and did not honor waranty,I had it for a month and loved it except when it overflowed twice. Then it died completely. Per the instructions I returned the power cord cut from the dead unit along with a bar code to get my replacement washer sent to me. Washer was never sent and because I had already sent my proof of purchase to the company (apparently I was supposed to xerox it in case) they would do nothing for me.On the other hand it is several inches thinner than competing brands and I appreciated that.
3,Be careful about the retailer,"Simply put, this is an ok product...if you get what you want. I ordered this unit from a different retailer (wallyworld) and they sent me a different version of this product that only used (1) lower spray arm. I researched portable dishwashers, before deciding on this unit, solely because it has (2) spray arms (supposedly). So double check, before you purchase, or make sure the return policy is solid. Lastly, the problems concerning cycling, and the 'fault' warnings, may very well be avoided by using the proper temperature levels (or just use cold water). My unit ran fine for 3 full cycles, but then cramped up - getting out of sync with itself. I believe this happens because the thing overheats, if your water supply is too hot. I turned mine down, and have yet to experince any more trouble. 2cents, hope it helps - Duane"
1,don't bother!,"I bought mine less than two years, it works good after a while then it broke down, flooded my kitchen.Not worth fixingt.Don't even bother with this machine, save your money and agrrevation'you'll be sorry!"
4,Good dishwasher and worth the price,I love the dishwasher so far it works well. I appreciate the fact that it fits in my very small kitchen and is easy to use. It is worth its price.
3,"Not quite a recommendation, more a suggestion.","I considered buying this dishwasher, but when I compared the dimensions given with the height of the space between my counter and cabinets, I realized it wouldn't have fit! I wound up getting a Danby countertop dishwasher instead, as it was a few inches shorter, and would fit on my counter under the cabinets. Measure before you buy!My Danby countertop dishwasher has worked well, cleaning dishes thouroghly, and with no breakdowns or hassles, for several months now. I just use the cheapest store brand powder detergent, with the heated water cycle. So a countertop dishwasher can work well, although I can not comment directly on this brand."
2,Beware of Haier!,"Hi all, I LOVED this, I bought it back in July direct from Haier and it died in August. It has been at a service center (and still is now it's December) and after MONTHS of haggling with Haier and being told the parts are on back order they are finally shipping a new one. I'm suppose to recieve it this Thursday Dec 11th and I'm not holding my breath. Haier customer service was unreal and just awful. The only reason why I was able to get them to send me another one was because I found it online here and on Wal-mart.com. I couldn't understand how I could buy it in have it in a day and they were making me wait over 4 months for parts, espcially when it was it was brand new when it died. Just be careful! It shorted out but it is cool. Haier customer service WAS THE PITS! Thumbs DOWN 100% to them! BOoooooooo!!! -James Bishop, Manchester VT."
5,An Alien Dies RULES!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"You learn a ton about Elfangor in this book. He marries a human, has a kid, and meets his first Ellimist! Cool, huh? If you've read the other Andalite Chronicles books, but not the third one, you're in for a suprise! K.A. quotes: ""Elfangor...Tobias...Sssssshhh no tell him!"
2,Animorphs needs some work,"Animorphs needs to work on its writing style.No, I am not insane. I am stating what is true. Animorphs will eventually become what Goosebumps has: a easy way for its author to get money. I admit R.L. Stine would never, ever talk about what it would be like to be in a animal's body; that would be too hard in his 800-word vocabulary, so, possibly Animorphs won't become the horrible 'Goosebumps'."
3,Good for little baby,"this pad is some small for my newborn baby. My baby was about 56cm when he came to the world. He grow fast and his leg is out of the pad's range. If you want to use this pad for a longer time, consider to buy a bigger one. But overall, the pad is in good condition."
2,Actual size is too small,"The actual size of the pad is too small to be functional, so I will have to return it. The dimensions of the pad would only fit a newborn. The product photo is misleading."
5,great product,now i don't have to keep taking the one out of the diaper bag and i can use this one for at home. it works great.
5,Brilliant,Kevn shows incredible songwriting talent on this album.Much like MacDougal Blues (produced by Peter Buck of REM) Kevn has spun some wonderful stories and melodies.
4,Well done pop-alt record,"I can say that this is a markedly enjoyable album. Similarly to Panic! At the Disco's ""A fever..."", I found myself laughing out loud in places at the lyrics, which while sometimes serious, are so enjoyable they bring a smile to ones face. I especially enjoyed L.G. Fuad, and their slight slight towards emo. ""When I comitted suicide... social suicide""Even though they have poppy happy songs, their slow, emoish tracks, notably ""Together Well ring in the New Year"" are the ones that offer the most beautiful and insightful thoughts.""These humans all suck, id rather be home feeling violent and lonely""This album is an enjoyable trip of strong, crunchy guitars and a smooth, delicate and poppy vocalist. I strongly recommend this to those looking for a fun album to listen to over and over again."
2,not for mcs fans,"Dont get this cd if you are a big fan of motion city soundtrack. ""I am the movie"" is so much better than this cd, dont even bother listening to it."
2,I Underestimated MCS....,"When my sister first started playing this CD in our room every night, it annoyed me. I couldn't stand it. But then, I decided to really listen to it. And I found that I really, really liked the group.Hangman was the first song on the album that I started to like even remotely. It caught on quick and became one of my favorite songs. I then started to like Everything is Alright.I found that both are equally good songs, made by an interestingly catchy group.You should give this CD a try."
4,Wind me up!,"This is a great release. Think about it, you've got probably the most gifted bassist of his era (Billy Sheehan of Talas and David Lee Roth) and a guitar virtuoso (Paul Gilbert of Racer-X). Do I have to say more? I'd consider this more hard rock than metal and that's no slam either. A very talented band and a very cool release."
4,Good music,"They have a blues sound, and the lead singer has an amazing voice. The best song is Anything for you! But there isn't a bad song on this CD...buy it you'll listen to it all the way thru."
1,Do not buy this VCR!,I purchased this VCR as a replacement of another JVC VCR which stopped working after the blackout last summer. This VCR only comes with a 90day labor/parts warranty - in the past VCRs came with one year for parts. I rarely use this VCR and yesterday it recorded sound but no picture. I took out the instruction sheet and it said to use a VCR head cleaner if this happens and so I did - the VCR still does not work. I have purchased many JVC products in the past but this is by far the worst product they have made in my opinion. The remote control is hard to get used to for programming recordings. I don't know what JVC was thinking when they manufactured this product - I guess they figured that no one was buying stand alone VCRs anymore so it didn't matter. I am now looking for another VCR after having thrown away $70. + tax on a piece of garbage.
1,Stopped working after 3 months,"I was perfectly pleased with this purchase for three months, but then the unit stopped working (wouldn't turn on). Nothing unusual happened - it just died. This may be an anomaly (I've never had any trouble with my other JVC electronics), but I thought it worth mentioning..."
1,omigod this is awful,"Barely know what to say here. I saw one reviewer state that Six of Nine was the worst thing about this show. I think its worse than that. I think she's the best thing about TTR, and I'm not going beyond her visual appeal here, because there is none. The writing is horrible, its not the least bit funny, and although the animation is quite good,...its just terrible. I can't imagine that even 13 year olds would go for it. Maybe stupid 13 year olds. I gave it one star because I couldn't submit my review otherwise, but I don't really mean it."
4,Rifters,This is an interesting way of presenting sci fi. The show is full of comedic adult content. From a perverted captain to a sex slave science officer.The show is alot of fun for anyone that enjoys parodies of famous sic fi movies and TV. Would recommend this product to anyone that just wants to sit back and laugh at the misadventures of the strangest crew the stars have ever seen.The biggest problem with the series is the casting change of Six every season. Gina Gershon did season 1 and I think she really did the best job out of the 3.
5,Get this Movie!!!!,Tuesday Weld is a sexy lady and Anthony Perkins can't enough of her. She knows it and she uses him every chance she gets. Tuesday Weld is very very appealing in this sixties movie and every film she has been in. The film is very clear and the story is great. Rent or buy this movie--Tuesday Weld will drive you crazy--it sure did that to me.
4,A Diary of A Death Foretold of Labor,"I have read nearly all London's works. The Iron Heel is not as wellknown. He weaves a tale of fact and some fiction of the crushing ofthe union movement in Chicago. A diary of relentenless persecution, by friends and foes of organized labor and how it is done. A Marketing Strategy of Demonizing and Crushing The Poor Working Stiff, or any movement that questions motives.Interesting read"
4,Hilarious Cover Designed by Non-Reader,"The Iron Heel is a dystopian novel set in 1912 (written in 1908), predicting an onset of capitalist oligarchy and anyone buying this edition hoping for some BDSM titillation will be sorely disappointed.That said, this is a very interesting book. Although its characters are not nearly as emotionally engaging as those in either 1984 or Brave New World, it is well enough written (especially the violent climax - action, is, after all, London's forte) to be worth reading on its own merits."
2,It WAS the player....,"Yes, it was a problem with the N50. It would happen with all different output modes, and would come up almost on cue when I fast-forwarded through a section. I recently returned the JVC and bougt a Pioneer DV-563AS, and have had no such issues with the same movies in any player mode, progressive or not. This is a problem that JVC shoull adress, as it is a shame that an affordable player such as the XVN series with so many good features suffers fro this.Here is a review site (CNET) that talks about the problem on the silver (XVN-55SL) player.http://reviews.cnet.com/JVC_XV_N55SL/4505-6473_7-30459924.html?tag=pdtl-listSkip this one and go for either the Panasonic S55S or the above-mentioned Pioneer (unfortunately, both only available in silver)."
3,JVC and other top brands,"I purchased this unit for christmas and it really has lots offeatures a great machine. but JVC, PANASONIC, SONY AND othertop brand dvd player manufacture should realize that we live inGLOBAL market with dvd disks from all over the world and thismachine only play NSTC region 1 please at least give us the option to use diferent systems like NTSC/PALnext time I will invest my money in one unit made by a KOREANcompany that is compatible with NSTC/PAL."
2,Thermometer review,"Thermometer is okay, but not very user friendly. It is hard to get to the setting you want, and hard to tell when it is done. I also don't trust it's accuracy, as it reads very low."
1,A total bummer. Don't waste your money.,"Bad, bad, bad. Uneven toasting, a bagel setting that doesn't work, weird burning around the perimeter of just about every kind of bread. I have other Kitchenaid products and love them (clothes washer, dish washer), but I will be avoiding their countertop products in the future."
1,makes a ton of noise,"I just bought got this fridge and it makes a ton of noise. The noise will cut off for a few minutes then it will come back on, and the process repeats...Anyone else have problems like this?"
5,kid's boombox,This is one tough toy. Gave it to a 2 yr old and she absolutely loves it. Ditch the little pretend cd's or the kid will get frustrated trying to get them in. The songs are short and fun and easy for a kid to learn. The mike is strong and she loves to talk and breath into it. It really takes a beating as she carries it everywhere.
1,Yuk,This book could have been written in 20 pages. Kept turning and turning the pages waiting for some type of story. Very boring reading. Don't waste your time.
3,Savatage go deeper,"""Gutter Ballet"" represents a transitionary period for this band between the early straight ahead glam metal of ""Power Of The Night"" and ""Fight For The Rock"" and the more complex work to follow. All of the metal cliches are present, but the people and situations described in these songs begin to show signs of three dimensionality. This is the album that gave the world a small preview of Savatage's place in musical history."
3,fan of EWF Philip Bailey? Yes.Solo Philip? not as much,"I have Philip Bailey Records Solo&His Gospel Recordings but they are missing that key element that Maurice White&Crew could always bring out of Him.this Album doesn't Bring that feeling for me.He has His Moments but there is a term called Chemistry&nobody outside of His EWF Surroundings has captured that with Philip like Maurice White has been able to do in the past.Not Bad but Compared to His Rich Vocals,Writing&Vibe on EWF Projects this is kinda just there overall."
2,"Too long, Too unorganized","For all the hype this book has received I am pretty disappointed. I found this book to be written in a very non-engaging style, making it difficult to just follow what the author was saying. Additionally it's absolutely terribly organized. What kind of programming book spends the first couple of chapters talking about programs that use and implement classes, and then finally halfway through the book actually tells you what a class is and how to make one.It's absolutely unusable as a reference, and just barely useable as a means of learning C++. C++ is a very large and complicated programming language, and therefore books on it should do their best to be as helpful and organized as possible.If programming languages were books, C++ would be ""C++ Primer"", poorly thought out, unorganized, and unnecessarily complicated."
5,One for the Family,"My younger brother (age 10) really loved this book, and I (age 15) got a kick out of it as well. It includes the answers to all the questions that anybody has ever asked or idly wondered about Santa Claus.Some questions are quite general, and I'm sure every reader thought about them as a kid, for instance, ""How can the reindeer fly?"" Others are quite specific: ""What does Santa eat?""What makes this book special is that it puts both children and adults in the Christmas spirit: Although the answers to the 101 questions are filled with jokes, they make it seem that Santa really does exist, and gives explanations why. The answers will be too charming to make anybody but a Grinch want to rebut them.Your favorite answer will most certainly be the one to question #101: It is a short, poignant essay on the nature of Santa. It points out that he will exist as long as children keep on believing and looking forward to his visits."
3,not for the technically minded,"This is an entertaining and well written book on some of the do's and don'ts of data analysis. To quote from Dr. Beers review below, ""The main emphasis is on the art of data interpretation."" Indeed there are useful tools here for performing sanity checks and for asking critical questions about all sorts of data collections. ... The examples are, at best, sketchy and few in number. The anectodes are amusing but not terribly informative. I would have much preferred more concrete examples and further discussion on some technical matters. ...."
2,Just kicking open doors,This book deserves some merit as a summary of important ideas. Nevertheless it is not worth the investment of money and time because the ideas of the author are as obvious and repetitive as it gets. It is not by saying to think critically or to document your research that you can justify to publish a book and to call it 'turning numbers into knowledge'.
5,Everyone should have a Raclette,My daughter first saw a raclette on a trip to visit her in-laws in England. Amazon was the only place we were able to find it. It is a great way to get family and friends around the table for meals. It is interactive and so easy to use. It takes family style dining to a whole new level.
2,Cubbies deserve more,"If you are a Cubs fan you will be disappointed because you love anything about the Cubs but this DVD is slow and boring. Giving a so-so look at the ball park, a less than steller history of the Cubs, and no real salute to the fans makes you very annoyed. The only good part was the walk through of a day at the park and the narrator. If you are looking for a good 'past 100 years in Cubs baseball"" don't buy this-but if you buy everything that relates to the Cubs you might as well get it. It is a slow boring documentary with moments of tolerence. Keep shopping."
4,Complete DVD of Championship Game,"This offers the 2002 NCAA Football Championship game in its full entirety and a great viewing of a game that was decided pretty darn early. The only thing about the DVD that I wish were different is that you can only rewind by chapters to 'pre-game', 'first half', 'second half', and 'post-game'. This made it hard to rewind specific plays you wanted to see."
3,"Good seatpost, but not as described","The Promax black alloy seatpost is a fantastic seatpost - does everything it should do, which is hold the seat securely. Only problem is that I specifically ordered this seatpost because I believed that the one I would receive would be the same as the one I see in the picture, but it turns out that I was wrong. Instead of receiving a black seatpost with a silver top (like the picture) I received an all black one. I was disappointed, but did not return the product nor ask the sender any questions as it did not bother me that much."
3,Big Price to Pay for Glow-in-the-Dark,"OK so the kewlest thing about these darts is they glow in dark. Other than that, they are just overpriced Micro Darts. Although these darts are the recommended refill for theHasbro Nerf N-Strike Firefly REV-8, any Nerf micro dart will work in that gun. So if you do not need the glow-in-the-dark feature theNERF Dart Tag Refill Pack: 30 Tagger Micro Dartsis a much better deal. (And by the way, the 30-count bag of tagger darts was only $9.99 when I was at Target today.)One other thing about the glow-in-the-dark darts. They do not shoot as far as the tagger darts or the sonic darts. In my experience both of those travel about 25% further."
2,Two boys' review: Negatives outweigh the glow gimmick,"We bought a packet of these glow-in-the-dark Nerf darts for our sons'Nerf Nite Finder EX-3. The glow darts don't fly as far nor do they fly as accurately as the micro darts that were included with the Nerf gun.Do these darts glow in the dark? Yes. But for the price - almost a dollar each - the negatives outweigh the gimmick. I recommend theHasbro Nerf Mega Micro Dart Packif you like to use suction cup tips for target practice. For tag players, try theHasbro Nerf Dart Tag Refill Pack: 30 Tagger Micro Dartsinstead."
1,Buyer Beware!!,"These do not work with a many ""N-Strike"" guns. It only works with N-Strike guns that have the clip system. It's easy to look at these and think they will work with any Nerf gun--the size is about the same. But it won't. I have all non-clip N-Strike Nerf guns and they work with none of them. Hasbro does have on there that they are for the Clip system, but there is no warning they won't work with the other N-Strike guns. If you aren't aware there's a difference you may end up buying a lot of these like I did and then find out your out of luck."
5,"fun, fun, fun",my grandson had a nerf gun party...what a hoot! all those younguns playing shooting games. we had a great time.
3,not super,"good smell but from the descritpion I was expecting a more citrus type of fragrance, on the contrary it is too ""orangy"" and sweet, not my best, but at that price I cant shriek anyway."
4,Good reference,"First of all, I will agree with the other readers that this book has a number of typos; it probably also has too few examples to be used as an undergrad or first year grad student text. However, as an advanced grad student who needed a good reference on some of the foundational results in fuzzy logic, it was just what I needed. The important results are all there, with references to where you can go in the literature to learn more. I would love to see a second edition of this book with the typos fixed and some new research results, however."
1,Don't waste your money on this,"Although the purpose of this toy is great, the quality of it is not! While playing with it appropriately, my daughter ripped off the ball release within a half hour on the first day she got it. I emailed the company and they sent me a free replacement. The replacement only lasted for about a month. I definitely would not recommend this to anyone!!!"
3,not for the serious history buff !,"The book is kind of cute,but is not for anyone serious about the history of slavery.It would be great for your kids if they are writing a book report on slavery,as it contains cute little pop ups,(thats your interaction),and is mild enough for children to read.also,if you are like me and are looking for historical fact with as little objectivity as possible,this would not be the book for you,as the information is too limited,and the author tends to use phrases like ""my people"".not that I don't understand her feeling a connection to this tragedy,I'd just rather get down to the facts,wich I already stated are way too limited,not informative enough.like I said,great for young children,but hardly an adult historical account."
1,disappointed,"I ordered this cd specifically for one song that is hard to get. When i got the CD's, the CD that was suppose to contain that song had been swapped out for a different cd. Not only that, but a cd was completely missing from the set. I emailed the vendor and they never responded."
1,Really Bad Product: Had to Return,"Perhaps the built in phone adapter works fine, but as a router it is a remarkably bad product. The router kept resetting itself (both the wireless and the ethernet) every few minutes, and seems that when it came back online it didnt use the security settings for the wireless account and so other people were able to access my wireless network. I currently use a Belkin product with the phone adapter provided by AT&T and thinks work just fine. Avoid at all costs, expecially given that Linksys does not maintain any firmware for this product."
2,Stay away from CallVantage,"I had the following problems with AT&T; CallVantage:1. My Caller ID never showed up correctly on the phone of the party I was calling. It just gave my city and state, not my name.2. I would sometimes have problems having phone menus understand my input (i.e., dial 1 for English, 2 for Spanish). It made checking my cell phone voice mail troublesome.3. Terrible tech support.4. Overpriced.5. There were taxes and fees on my monthly statement that weren't disclosed when I signed up.I have since switched to a company called Teliax and am very happy with them. They are also cheaper - my phone bill will only come to about $10 this month, including long distance."
3,boring,"I never could figure this game out, perhaps I was doing something wrong, but if not then it was not worth what I paid. I am a simple gamer on PC, so perhaps I just didn't know what I was doing, but I would look for long periods of time and not find anything to shoot. This game had good reviews so I would not want to discourage someone who is a little more up on games not to purchase it. I was really looking forward to it, but you win some you lose some."
1,get the 4 disc set of dawn of the dead instead!!!,the disc is ok but get the 4 disc set of dawn of the dead and you'll get this same cut to choose from plus much more!!!!!
3,Good but not great!,"As an African-American hungry for more mystery/suspense written by and for African-Americans, I jumped on this book when I first saw it. I liked the author's writing style and the plot was original. However, I think my main problem with the book was that I just didn't like Mary, the main character. I felt she was moody, whiny, and self absorbed and I felt sorry for her poor husband. I would read another book by this author though."
3,Vivicam 20 shows great promise but...,"so far, Windows XP won't recognize the camera on two different computers. If I can get a response from tech support, I suspect they can address it. So far, no response."
1,What a ripoff,"What was advertized was a 10 page digital document of over 2700 words. What was delivered was a 360 word blurb, nothing more than a product announcement.NIKON DEBUTS NEXIV VMR-H3030 VIDEO MEASURING TOOL.: An article from: Imaging Update"
5,use any and every technique at your disposal,"I believe that there are as many ways to lose weight and keep it off that vary as much as we as individuals vary. However I also believe that there is one common denominator that links the most successful ""reduction mode"" diets. The amount of carbohydrates we eat must be restricted in some way, form or mean, or even temporarily cut out to achieve the best results.What is different about this book is that it actually gives an explanation for all of our impulsive cravings that actually makes sense and that you can easily apply to your everyday eating. I personally keep some of the advice in mind as to when I eat my carbohydrates even though I prefer a simple high protein diet that works for me. So while you search for the plan that best suits you, don't ignore the advice this book has to offer. Use any and every technique at your disposal to wage the battle of the ever-increasing waistline."
1,Use Caution......,"Please use caution when using this diet. It did wonderful for me for the first 2 weeks and I thought I was actually going to get rid of this excess. However after the 2nd week I never lost another pound, I was on the diet for a total of 5 weeks and only lost 5 lbs. The second problem is that I totally skipped my cycle for the whole time I was on the diet and did not have it again till a week after I stopped the diet. This diet was the cause of that and caused an imbalance in my system that caused my cycle to stop. Please use caution with this diet and talk to your doctor before you start and if you have any odd issues come up."
1,"Nice idea, but DOESN'T WORK","I agree with the person who tried this diet for 7 weeks, lost 5 lbs. the first week, then nothing else happened. That's exactly what happened to me! I started on January 18th (nine weeks ago) and I finally quit in disgust a few days ago. What WAS true is that you lose your food cravings during the day (I stuck to protein and vegetables/salad during breakfast and lunch.) What is NOT TRUE is that your daily reward meal (usually at dinner) will enable you to lose weight. In other words, my food craving stopped, but I didn't lose weight! As a matter of fact, I started gaining weight in weeks two, three and four before again reversing. I agree in principle with everything said in this book (including the need to regulate insulin/blood sugar.) And if your goal is WEIGHT MAINTENANCE while eating anything you want (including pizza, chocolate, ice cream, and pasta) on a daily basis, then this book is for you. But you will NEVER NEVER NEVER lose weight with this."
2,Everything in Moderation,"It's hard for me to fault the book for delivering what the title says, I just don't believe it's terribly healthy. I think you need a healthy amount of all macro-nutrients in your diet and a good amount of exercise. Changing your short-term actions are only going to result in short-term gains. Eating nothing but proteins is no more healthy than an all sugar or fat diet."
4,A TREAT WHEN YOU EAT !,"I like this book very much ! I followed this diet with a friend and she an I were trying to lose weight . Guess what, THE DIET DID WORK ! The book tells you what you have to eat thru the course of the day with foods that are low in carbohydrates. You can decide which meal of the day you choose to have your goodies (TREATS).For EXAMPLE: If you want a Treat for breakfast it can only be with that meal. You can decide when you want to eat your treat, either it be lunch or dinner its up to you. But It will only be that one meal of the day that you choose. You CANNOT eat your TREATS in every meal. Of course, we incorporated EXCERCISE which also helped in the process to lose weight. I'm the type of person who likes VARIETY, so I have many books on diet and nutrition. So when I get bored with one diet I can choose another. When I do find the BEST diet for me, I will tell all you readers out there about it! Stay motivated and be forever fit!"
1,"Not even 1 star, I'd give it -5 if I had the choice","I tried this diet because, like Rachel Heller I have PCOS. The quiz said that I was severely insulin resistant (and an endocrinologist recently confirmed this). I followed this diet and if anything, it made my symptoms worse. I had horrible mood swings and could not concentrate because I had a foggy feeling. My blood sugar was at an all time high when I was on this diet and I did not lose any weight. I noticed an immediate improvement of my symptoms and a return of energy when I went on Weight Watchers and started eating several small meals a day balanced with both carbohydrates and protien and I lost 30 pounds within 6 months. Buyer beware, it didn't work for me."
5,"Finally, I,ve found a solution to my weight problem!!!","When I read the book. It became THIS IS ME !!! I definately am a carbo addict. I have followed the diet for a little over 2 weeks and ,Yes, the hole in my stomach and the constant hunger are gone. I don't continually crave food. I have also lost 5 pounds. It,s great !! By the way, I am not Joe, I,m Joe,s wife, Marian."
3,WHAT DO WE DO NOW?,"I just finished HEALTHY FOR LIFE a book published much later then this one, but by the same people about the same topic. There are some real differences between the two. In HEALTHY FOR LIFE there is no 60 min supper time limit, they tell us not to use artificial sweeteners (no diet soda), there is a BIG push toward salad eating, and the strangest part is that they now inforce portion control which is something that they never cared about in the reward meals before. They want us to only eat 1/4 carbs in our reward meal plus a 2 cup salad, and absolutely no gum or mints of any kind. I guess I will take from each book what is right for me. I wish there was a help line to answer some of my questions."
2,Very Disappointing,"When I saw the title of this book I thought ""This is for me!"". I fit the severe CA profile. I was looking for a plan would allow me to stay on for the long term. I read about 1/3 of the book and decided to start while continuing to read it. I have to admit that I never felt hungry after eating the complimentary meals. However, I began to feel dizzy and disoriented about the third day until I got to my reward meal (dinner). So much so that I could not function well. I followed the plan to the letter. I deducted that it must be hypoglycemia.I am sure with all of the other glowing feedback that it must be working wonderfully for some. Just not for me. By the way...I did eat what I wanted at the reward meal and never gained. However, I never lost either!"
2,Ummm...,"I read the book and really enjoyed it. I tried the diet and could not stick with it. I think I really felt more hungry during this diet than on any other day. I think this could probably really work for other people but I am not a big meat, cheese, egg eater. I also just find the idea of being able to eat as many carbs as you want at one time a little questionable."
5,This is an eating program for life.,"I can't say enough about how wonderful it is to be able to be disciplined in my relationship to food. I have a plan which is very easy to follow and I know that my body can and will be healthier and stronger for it. I no longer crave sugar and caffeine and for me that equates to more energy! This is hands-down the easiest diet plan ever. Actually, I don't think of it as a diet plan, but as a life-long way of eating. Thank you to the Heller's for all of the many years of research and the inexpensive way to weight loss. Thank you for educating so many of us who have been successful with your program, but have always been told in the past that they had no willpower. I've lost 15 pounds in 3 months, and intend to lose a lot more weight over the course of a year. I know that I can succeed and you can too!"
5,"The first ""diet"" I have tried that's easy, sensible & works.","My husband and I have been on this new eating plan since Oct. 7, 1998. I had read and tried the Adkins Diet and had some luck with it. I found this book in seaching Amazon.Com for more info on the low carb type diets. I ordered, read and shared it with my husband. I have lost 20 lbs and my husband has lost 29.5 lbs and we feel great, are not craving foods, have lots of energy and basically food does not hold the same priority in our lives as it did. We really enjoy being able, though, to have a reward meal and eat anything we may want. We have never felt deprived. It really works!On the recipes, a more expanded breakfast menu with more items would be nice. But, all in all it is the best we've tried. We plan to make it a life time way of eating ."
4,good book,This will help with some ideas for meals. I am a diabetic and need lots of help to control my sugar. Thanks
3,This was groundbreaking a decade ago but needs updated!,"I'd recommend instead either Chocolate is My Kryptonite: Feeding Your Feelings/How to Survive the Forces of Food by Dr. Matthew Keene, or Kay Sheppards book, Food Addiction the Body Knows. Both of these books explain carbohydrate addiction from both a neurochemical and emotional basis with emphasis on serotonin (a clear-cut chemical involved in emotion and addiction) as opposed to the over-emphasis on insulin that The Carbohydrate Addict's Diet proposes. nonetheless, this was one of the first books out there on food addiction, and as such, I thank the authors for their efforts"
2,OCD for weight loss,"The book and program are borderline obsessive/compulsive. I get the fact that book is written for a carb addict but the requirements of the program promote obsessive weight management. If you have to weigh every day and you live, eat and breathe weight loss then this is book for you. If you are like me and just want to be normal, I don't recommend this book at all. The recipes are helpful, but that is about the only positive I have for book."
3,"Love Sookie, but this book not so much","I think this book was long on potential suitors and short on plot and action. I like Quinn, but Sookie did not seem to be using alot of common sense. She should have told Alcide to take a hike after Colonel Floods funeral. I'll still read the series I am addicted. This just wasn't my favorite."
4,Dead as a Doornail (Southern Vampire Mysteries),I'M NOT MUCH FOR REVIEWS BUT I ENJOY LISTENING AND RELISTENING TO THIS AUDIO BOOK I ONLY WISH THEY HAD STARTED WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE SERIES NOT IN THE MIDDLE.
4,Cute,"I love the Sookie books, and this one was cute though not as good as the first couple for me. I love the tension between the characters."
4,"Should Be Called ""Everybody Wants Sookie""","While there's certainly a lot of action going on here: multiple shootings, a fire, and a fight to be the new pack master of the Shreveport pack, the enduring theme of this book is Everybody Wants Sookie. I had to laugh: How can one gal, even if she is part fairy, attract the lustful attention of two vamps, a shifter, a were, another shifter, and yet another shifter. (One of them even has a steady job with good insurance benefits.) Fun, light as marshmallow cream, and - except for the packmaster fight - less violence than some of the books, Dead as a Doornail will keep you amused and glad that Sookie and all her many supe admirers are around for the ride."
2,Not As Good As The Others,I didn't enjoy this one as much as the others. It seemed like it wasn't wrote as well. Ms. Harris appeared to want to get to the end of it in a hurry. The new characters that are introduced in this one aren't described well and the familiar characters don't form any kind of true bond with them. The newer characters (were-panthers) that were wrote about last book aren't developed anymore in detail either even though it's were-animals getting shot. I think the idea of the book was a good one but it was almost like Ms. Harris treated this as a middle book that she had a lot to get accomplished in and was going to do it in a very little amount of pages. Just too rushed. You have to read it though if you are a fan of the series because some things get said that I think you may want to know for the next book. I'll probably continue reading but if this is the way she is going to continue with writing the series then I may not read many more of her books.
4,"Dead as a Doornail (Southern Vampire Mysteries, Book 5)",I really enjoy this entire series of books. They are quick easy fun reads and I enjoyed this one as much as all the others. I only wish the books were longer.
4,Good book,"This follows the story after the events of the fifth book. AN important thing happens almost at the end, not to spoil, but it has to do with Eric and Sookie. Very good and entertaining read, and as always the mystery was very good."
3,Books are Getting Lighter and Lighter for Me,"As I continue to read the Sookie novels, the more I feel that the story is so light and insubstantial, that I might not want to read anymore. Yes, they are amusing but not that much, at least anymore and the mysteries are very mysterious. Still like Sookie but not that big fan of the series now. I still love True Blood though. The show seems to pack more into it."
4,Excellent Character Development,"This is the first time I have ever read this far in a series and not gotten bored. I am loving all the characters and I find myself genuinely concerned with their safety... haha. This book was really good, I read it in less then a day. One thing to note, not one single sex scene in this installation. Interesting... why are bookstores putting this book in the 'paranormal romance' section when it is so not that. It should sit next to Anne Rice and Laurel K. in my opinion, and those typically go to horror. Even though Charlaine Harris isn't scarry by any means, she has definitely created her own genre, and it's causing chaos all across America."
3,"Well, it was better than some.","I'm a huge fan of CH's Sookie Stackhouse series, but the last two just aren't doing it for me. The plot in this book was weaker than the plot in the last book. Not only was it predictable, but it fell flat in the action department. And I was really disappointed when the secondary villian was killed. There was no suspense, no thrill...nothing.And I'm starting to see a Laurell K. Hamilton trend with all of the multiple male interest. I don't like this angle, because it's as if they're aren't any eligible females in the vacinity.I did however, really enjoy the battle of the Weres for control of the Pack. But I'm not liking how Alcide is turning out, being all devious and all that. I don't see how he can want to be with Sookie, when he can't even be honest with her, then blames her for things that's not her fault. To me, that's a man on my ""do not date"" list.Overrall, not her best."
3,Ugh,"Not your best book, Ms. Harris. I will give you this, we only had to read about the Word Of The Day twice and you didn't dress Sookie in any off the wall, Wal-Mart, backwoods clothes. If you're looking for action like the past few books, you're not going to find it here. DAADN was mild with a few hot chiles thrown in.Ms. Harris also needs to speak to her publisher about the awful covers on her books. They look like some 12 year old fantasy book instead of the blood,sex and shapeshifting books that they are."
2,Not so hot...literally,"Received this as a gift and I must say I'm very disappointed. At its highest setting it takes forever to toast. The other issue is that if you buy any bread with ""non-standard"" width (like home-made, gourmet breads) it won't fit into the toaster."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS TOASTER!,"I would give this toaster a ""0"" if that were an option in rating. We bought this toaster a little over a year ago. The first one had to be set on the darkest setting after about three months to get it to toast at all. I do have to say, Kitchenaid was good about replacing it. The replacement we have now toasted at the correct setting for about another 3 months. I say correct setting when speaking of the first 2 pieces. You had to turn it to lighter if you wanted to toast another piece as this time it burnt. Now it is again not toasting unless it is set on darkest setting. Our normal setting, at a little more than half way on the dial, doesn't even get the bread warm much less toasted. We're having to run it twice, and watching closely so it doesn't burn, to get toast. It also has the same problem of burning if we try to fix extra. Temperture control is non-exsistent in this toaster."
1,Even replacement toaster broke,"I purchased this toaster due to a recommendation on Consumer Reports. It broke after one month of use. KitchenAid customer service was great and sent me a new one. Now 6 months later, the replacement toaster has broken. I am going to get a cheap toaster."
1,Nice Idea - Failed Implementation,"I wanted to like this toaster. It looks nice, seems sturdy enough, and stays cool to the touch. But it toasts poorly. One side of the bread toasts more than the other. So I have to pop up the toast 1/2 way through and turn it over. And now the pop up mechanism isn't working well."
2,They don't make em like they used to,"This is the third toaster I have purchased in the last 12 months. I'm getting ready to send it to the Goodwill and purchase a fourth. I like my toast fast, brown and not all dried out. This toaster takes at least 3 minutes and two tries on the darkest setting to get the toast brown and by that time, the toast is as dry as dust. My father suggested I check the wattage on the toaster - it is 850W. He checked his older, less expensive and better-performing Kenmore, two-slice toaster and discovered it to be 1050W. We suspect that American toasters now have less wattage for either environmental or safety concerns. Whatever the reason, the toaster is unsatisfactory for making toast although as others have noted, it does a pretty good job on bagels. I'm going to try the Krups FEM2B next. It's the only 1050W two-slice toaster listed on Amazon (many of the toasters do not state the watts)."
1,Cheap and disappointing,"I know $40 doesn't sound like alot of money now a days but this toaster isreally cheesy looking, flimsy, very lightweight and knocks over if you pull on cord and it either barely toasts or it burns! VERY disappointing for a Kitchenaid product. I will never buy another appliance thru Amazon thats for sure! I am now strictly a go to the mall and see for myself consumer!"
1,A Toaster That Belongs in the Garbage,"I've tried two of these toasters from two different retailers, purchasing them ten months apart.I bought the first one and had the same problem as others here apparently have. That is, the toaster didn't toast.On the highest setting, the toast came out barely toasted (and unevenly so, to boot), requiring two rounds through the toaster to produce toast. On the lowest setting, it came out as if it was never in the toaster at all (i.e. the same temperature it was when it went in).10 months later, after convincing myself that the first was a fluke (and still really wanting a toaster that matched my other Kitchen Aid appliances - silly, I know), I tried again and bought the same model again.This one works just as poorly.I can't even describe my disappointment. As I told my wife, ""I just don't understand it. It's made by Kitchen Aid!""Apparently, FOR THE WAY IT'S MADE(tm) doesn't apply to this product."
1,Terrible toasting levels,"I purchased this toaster after reading about it in Consumer Reports, it was rated #2or #3, It performs terrible, the toast levels are nonexistent you have to move the lever all the way to the ""dark"" side to get minimully toasted color. Directions say the moisture content of the bread will cause the toast to come out different, i found that that was of no consequence to the outcome. I would love to return it to Amazon; however we discarded the box by mistake with the Christmas wrappings."
2,"Toaster ""Blues""","Big, bulky, cord is inflexible. No matter what I put in this toaster the top inch of so gets burned, the rest is a pale version of toasted bread. The only thing going for this toaster is its beautiful blue color. Now to get the bread toasted a lovely brown, not burnt, color/flavor!"
1,TERRIBLE TOASTER,"I bought this toaster with wedding money thinking that the Kitchen Aid model would be great--all their other products are. What a complete WASTE of money!! I even called the company and they sent me another one--same problems as the first one. The toast did not brown at all. I don't like my toast black, but hey, warmish bread is not ideal either."
1,A toaster that doesn't toast.,"You would think a $60 Kitchen Aid toaster would perform the simple task of toasting bread evenly and to the desired degree of doneness with no trouble. You would be wrong. As other reviewers have noted, it doesn't toast bread dark enough - even on the highest setting - and when it finally does (after two or three trips through) the outside of the bread is darker than the inside.This technological wonder replaces a $7 White Westinghouse toaster that worked for years until it was knocked on the floor and broken. It's only problem was that it was sometimes a little too small to fully accommodate slices of my homemade cracked wheat bread. Otherwise, it just quietly did its job - every morning.Kitchen Aid ought to be ashamed and embarrassed that they can't do for $50 - $60 what someone else can do for under $10."
2,Toaster meets its color but doesn't hold up in spades,"After reading several on-line reviews I picked this popular toaster because of its features including wide-slots and warming feature. It initially lived up to its description with slices a nice even brown and plenty of room for thicker-sliced french bread we favor. However. after only 4 months of use it broke and refused to lower the slices and turn on. The toaster was replaced under warranty, but the second one has now broken in the same way after only a little over a year, but after the warranty had expired. Don't buy this unless you like replacing toasters."
1,Good only for bagels or white bread,"I like heavy grain breads and this toaster is a disaster for toasting such breads. You must set the browning to darkest for the first toasting and then retoast. Always. The bread never comes out toasted the first time. What bothers me most is that the bread will burn if you forget to reset the browning to midway for the second toasting. And,no, you can't do two passes with a midway setting. The midway setting requires three passes.I'm also disappointed with this toaster because the toast browns unevenly. I have yet to get a piece of toast (even white bread) that is evenly browned on both sides or even edge-to-edge on either side.I do agree that it does a credible job on bagels.KitchenAid should market this product as a bagel toaster only."
4,"Nice game - Good graphics, nice story","Nice game- great graphics and good job with the different environments. I personally thought it was a good all around FPS type game. A bit limited on the interactions, but nice plot as far as FPS goes. Nice set of weapons even though you tend to gravitate to your favorites."
1,I was very disappointed,"I loved Unreal! I loved Unreal Championship! Unreal II SUCKS! It's on the XBOX, so why such bad graphics?! The video outtakes are toooooooo long! Why bother with them, after we've played the game once they just get in the way of replayability. (is that a word)Buy it used, if you just have to have it, or better yet borrow it from a friend and don't watse the money."
4,A horrible addition to the Unreal franchise,THIS GAME IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Thankfully I only rented this game! The animation of the charcters and enemies is crapy!!!! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!(...)
1,so repetitive !!,"I dont understand why this book gets such good reviews.... the writing is mind numbingly repetitive and the point gets lost. David Deida was recommended to me but I find this book very disapointing.There are better books out there ... Charles Muir comes to mind, Margot Anand.... and a multitude of others."
1,NOT in high def at all!,"I was SO disappointed in this blu-ray version of The Dark Crystal. It's not in high definition at all! It's just a copy of the DVD version. I even took the time to write to Sony Pictures to complain about being cheated by their false advertising. Don't waste your money on this junk. The DVD actually looks better, in my opinion."
5,A timeless clasic for any collection,"After not having seen it in over 10 years this movie still impreses me. I saw it as a kid and after many years I found it on DVD, although I was scared of being disapointed since movies today are more tecnologicly advanced, my fears ended during the first minute. wow wow wow wow The making is incredible"
4,"not traditional muppets, but well done","This is not a tradition muppet caper. It is darker and for older children or adults. I bought this with a youngster in mind. It was a good story but I think that it is too scary for real young children. I will keep it and let him watch it when I think he is old enough. For now, we will stick with Kermit and Miss Piggy."
4,Get dream-fasted!,"I remember seeing little parts of it when i was a kid in a film show back in the 80s and it intrigued and scared me. Last year i was fortunate to see this edition on sale and bought it and was beaming with expectation. So i finally saw the film, after all these years and i'm still intrigued and scared by it! It is visually beautiful and i think that's its strongest asset. The dialogue can be a bit corny sometimes and the story is very straightfoward (that's not criticism). The score by Trevor Jones is astonishingly inspired and memorable. I wish i could find the soundtrack cd sometime soon cause it's just amazing! On the whole a wonderful, lush, inspiring motion picture any fantasy fan must own!"
5,Family-friendly FARSCAPE,"As the title hints at, I consider THE DARK CRYSTAL a PG-version of Farscape. That said, I only got into THE DARK CRYSTAL when it came out on UMD. TDC is one of those movies you have to be in a certian state-of-mind to throughly enjoy. Even as a 'Scaper, I am impressed with the puppetery. The funny thing is that THE DARK CRYSTAL is the only Jim Henson / Creature Shop production that I have on DVD."
3,Love this Movie!,Love the movie...just wish th HD transfer looked better but i guess you can't do too much. though i will say it is a vast improvement over the last dvd release!
1,This is a no go,"If you liked Willow, then you will like this movie. In other words, don't watch it. The only good part about it is laughing at it."
1,The Dark Crystal,These are the worst items I have ever purchased through Amazon.com. I bought two DVD's being told it was for spiritual growth and planned to give one as a gift. It makes Harry Potter look like non-fiction. Strange looking bird-like creatures hideous to look at was so disgusting I only watched for a few minutes and would like to return the mess.Everything else I ever bought through Amazon was fantastic and top shelf.Elaine Badnarik
2,,"I don't see the point in owning this DVD, anybody want can email me at my address and get it for free."
1,Frenetic Flickering,I purchased a set after seeing a similar product at a restaurant. My only complaint -and it was a deal-breaker- was that the flickering effect was so overdone as to suggest a candle struggling to stay lit in a windy location...not a soothing experience. I'm now on the hunt for something better.
4,For when candles are to messy,I have three cute little lanterns that I did not want to get messy with wax and smoke so these work well. They last fairly long when fully charged. I would recommend them for use.
4,excellent camera,"i really like my d-510, close-ups are beautiful, it performs extremely well - although the 'panorama' feature simply does not work anymore on my relatively new camerai do not like the sliding lens cover or the wait between shots or only being able to view pics when camera is shuti wish it recorded sound with the quicktime movie feature"
4,Great value digicam,"I got this camera for my mom and just test-drove it this weekend at a car show. It's a really great value! I thought that the picture quality would [stink] compared to my Olympus C2100UZ but it wasn't bad at all. And it's also easy to use, perfect for my mom. It's just a little heavier than I would've liked for her but I guess that's how digicams are."
4,"Detailed, pragmatic methodology; tons of useful frameworks","No nonsense, pragmatic methodology to marketing from high-level company vision to tactical implementation planning. McDonald presents tons of useful frameworks for how you think about marketing...some more useful than others, yet so many, you are bound to find ones useful for your business. Not a lot of conceptual BS...straight-forward how-to's including examples of plans"
1,NO GOOD !!,"I charge the batteery for more than 24 hrs.and put it to my Nokia 6230, after texting 5 times and I left my cell phone on for 12 hrs, the battery needs to be charge again. Normally a new battery lasts 2 to 2 1/2 days without ever charging. I think this is not new battery."
5,"EASY TO USE , COMPACT , SIMPLE","THIS CASE IS COMPACT , NEATLY MADE AND IT IS NOT BULKY LIKE SOME OTHER CASES. THE F31 FD TAKES REALLY WONDERFUL PICTURES AS WELL, IT IS A GOOD CASE AND CAMERA."
2,strange behavior,"I bought two Rainbirds including this Rain Bird 4-Inch 26 to 38-Foot Coverage Radius Pop-Up Rotor Sprinkler Head. I install them and turn on the water. Perfect--- just what I wanted and expected. All was well for the next couple of times. Then, when the sprinkler turned on the fourth time, the water pressure was very low and the two Rainbirds were watering only a third of normal. When I checked, this Rainbird had water gushing straight up out of the head. I eventually found that by pushing on the top of the head, the gushing stopped but pressure was still very low. Two days later that zone ran again and the Rainbirds ran as they should covering the intended area with good water pressure. They are due to run again tomorrow so we'll see."
1,BAAAA on this item,"What a disappointment from a brand for which I used to have so much respect. First of all, these products are touted as being for dry skin, and then they recommend exfoliation as if dry skin needed more irritation. The bath gel was a bit like an oil slick, floating on top of the tub water. What about the soap? It was soap plain and simple, which can be purchased for much less at any grocery. As for the hand cream, there were no softening properties whatsoever. After applying it, I turned to my favorite drug store brand. Now, the pail is something else - it really is useful. But, Crabtree & Evelyn, if I just wanted a pail, I could have simply trekked off to the hardware store. Since ""getting your goat"" means to annoy, the set is appropriately named."
5,Temptation Come My Way,This album paints a great portrait of southern metal! Each track has unique riffs giving each song a cool groove. This is the type of CD to bring on a cross-country road trip with your buddies. I don't what else to say - it's a great album! Give it a try!
3,not as good as A Chorus Of Obliteration,"I like this CD, but it is a totally different genre than the other one. You can't really even tell that it is the same band."
5,Insight: A Study of Human Understanding,"As far as I have read this book, it is very informative and indepth study."
5,RECOMMANDED,"ONE OF THE GREATEST ARENA ROCK ALBUMS FROM THE 80'S . GREAT VOCALS , BRILLIANT GUITAR WORKS AND ALMIGHTY ALICE COOPER SPECIAL GUEST ON 2 TRAX .IF YOU LIKE 'WHITESNAKE 87' OR EARLY 'WINGER ' WORKS DON'T MISS IT . ENJOY THE MADNESS !"
2,the best because it's the only...,"I am disappointed in this book, but it's the only one I could find, and it's not so expensive that I feel I wasted my money. I agree with the other comments; it really gives virtually no instructions (which wouldn't be a problem if it were not advertised as giving complete ones), the patterns are not very interesting, and it ought to have at least a few photos. Once you've done one or two yourself, you could easily make up this kind of pattern yourself. I also agree that there are newer styles, including spirals and other ""full-kippa"" designs, as opposed to solid color with a border, that should be included, along with extra instructions for increasing. The color chart is a nice touch, and it makes for a pretty cover, but the colors aren't very accurate. I thought it was a good idea to include contact information for a very good supplier.Perhaps the authors would consider a new edition?"
4,it's funny,I've had this book since high school and I'm 42 now! It's one of two books I used for dugmot and I always found it sufficient and useful... It's funny that so many people don't like the book.
5,Excellent Deal,"This deal is great! And well priced! The case is great, not only is it protective of both the body and the screen, but it also still fits in the case that came with the phone. Highly recommend getting one of these... especially if don't have any protection plan on the phone, and cant afford to break it. The charger is very handy, it does both Wall charge and Car charge, 2in1! Now thats a deal!"
3,WAY OVER PRICED,"who is this guy? i mean, i understand production costs---but this totally wasn't worth the money. I received another volume in this series and haven't even opened it yet. He's a good teacher and all---it just not very interactive."
2,Classic Comedy,"Not a great movie, but if you're into ghetto gangsterism you just might have a rip roaring time with this one, Charlie Murphy and Chris Rock are hilarious in this classic comedy about stealing rhymes and the consequences."
3,Whirlout for a front load washer,Ordered this product to help eliminate odors in my LG front loader....have used it twice and noticed a slight reduction in smell..one must dry out the rubber gasket after each use.
3,Could be better but you can learn from it.,"Myself: I took one Univerity level Spanish class and have gone throught all 8 CDS twice now.What I liked:1. Lots of vocabulary2. Was a good continuation of my Spanish learning.3. Actually learned a bunch of good useful phrases.What I didn't like:1. It should come with a book. Some words are hard to hearon the CD especially if you've never heard them before.2. Some of the conversations are rushed and I had to repeatthem 5 times to understand them even after the Englishtranslation.3. Some vocabulary was near useless4. Could be too technical in spots: Use the third personformal conjugated with the infinitive...Huh?, I don't evenknow what that means in English, just tell me how to saywhere's the bathroom already!"
4,You'll like this book if,"If you like historical fiction written in the early 1900's with heroes, villans, romance and mystery, you'll like this book."
2,Hoping it was just defective,"I ordered this thinking it was exactly what I wanted for my workspace. I just received it, put it together and when I put my CPU on it, the back wheel snapped off. It's made completely from plastic, except for the bolts holding the wheels in their plastic sleeves. Fortunately, when my CPU hit the wall and then the floor - it wasn't damaged. I'm currently waiting for a customer service reply so I can return it. I would consider a replacement, but depending on what the customer service reply is - I may shop around for something different.It was a great price and it arrived quick!"
3,Interesting Book,"I am a pre-med Junior in college and I enjoyed this book. It gives you a look into medical school, although it is through her sometimes negative or critical point of view. Interesting and easy to read."
2,Disappointing,"I bought this book because author Perri Klass has somehow acquired a stellar reputation as a medical author. The operative word in the preceding sentence is ""somehow,"" as I'm sure you noticed. This namby-pamby book is a reasonably accurate but dull rendition of what it is like to be a medical student, but the book is more about Klass' circuitous introspections and exhausting analyses than it is a book of interesting stories. In fact, I was so disappointed by this book that I re-read Klass' submission in ""Emergency Room-Lives Saved and Lost: Doctors Tell Their Stories"" to see if her book may have been an aberration of her youth, similar to Crichton's ""Five Patients."" Bottom line: The scorecard? Klass is now 0 for 2."
3,Compare C88 and C81,"I was torn between the C81 and the ""more professional"" model C88. I finally choose the more expensive C88, because I wanted ""the best.""My wife complained of the loud noise from the fan, so I returned this model and ordered the C81. IT IS THE SAME BOARD! The only difference seems to be the fan motor. The C81 does not seem to suffer much if any in the amount of power in vacuum mode and it also has the ""up draft"" mode. Also the C81 is heated in ""up draft"" mode.Over all The C81 is Highly recommended over the C88, and is much cheaper."
3,Not as durable as expected,"The camera broke after a week of use. The camera won't turn on at all. The photographs were fine, easy to use with the enclosed software. I am a little disappointed with the built in flash. It takes a lot of button pushing through the menu to get it to work."
2,Horrible Camera,I bought this camera as a temporary until I could afford a more expensive camera to replace the one my dog broke. Well the price was right and it looked like a nice camera. I have heard of Vivitar before so I thought it would have half way decent quality but it doesn't. No matter what mode is used inside the pictures either come out washed out or too dark. The colors are always wrong or very poor. Wether it is used indoors or outdoors the pictures usually come out blurry and they show no detail at all. I bought a pencam also and didn't like it but I have to say that for outdoor use it at least takes a clear detailed picture. This camera won't take a decent picture for anything.
3,nah...,"After seeing the video ""it's a shame about ray"" with Johnny Depp in it, I went out to buy this album. The songs are pretty good. My favorite is ""the turnpike down."", But still the album is not as rockin' as the other earlier lemonheads records. But it sure beats ""Come on feel the Lemonheads."" (cringing)"
5,Vintage glory,"I'm a die-hard alternative fan, and I saw a lemonheads cassette in a second hand store, in the midst of the statler brothers and some indie gospel tapes. I remember hearing the lemonheads on the radio but I could never remember which song. The cassette was fifty cents, so I decided to buy it, and as I went to the counter to pay for it, the nice lady said I could just take it. And so I did, having a rockin' stroll out of that secondhand store with a free lemonheads cassette.Tape has turned over about 12 times now and I still can't get the songs out of my head.A worthy pick-up."
5,classic,"I like the Lemonheads early stuff like Creator, but this album is their best. The original did not contain the radio hit ""Mrs. Robinson"", and that's how it should be. This is probably my favorite album of all time, and I have over a thousand albums. The music flows so seamlessly together, it's hard to believe it was made twenty years ago. The first song is very clever which Dando seems to incorporate quite easily. My favorite track is ""Drug Buddy"" which believe it or not was controversial back in 1992. In fact, this would be great album to partake of your favorite vice. It's mellow in parts, rocking in others, catchy jangle pop that stands up today. It is also short which I like. It clocks in just under thirty minutes. An essential album for your collection."
4,good book good start.,"This is a good bookwith a good start for parents to get there hands on to help inform and prepare them to make a good decision. It is easy to read and full of facts and some opinions and experiences. This is a good book to read but if you want scientific data presented on BOTH sides of the issue, with point and counter point facts then read Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neil Z. Miller. If you are going to read multiple books be sure to pick up The Vaccine Guide: Risks and Benefits but if you are only going to read one book make it Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective."
5,Thorough unbiased account of vaccinations,This book details the studies on each major vaccination. I would recommend this book to every parent and international traveler prior to receiving any vaccinations.
4,Incredible self-sacrifice and endurance.,"I was fascinated with the issues he explained in his story and how he overcome such hardship. I could not imagine how I would be able to sleep in such weather that could freeze parts of your body so quickly. Often I found myself wondering why, then how I would ever undertake such a journey.Amazon purchase."
4,"Good, not perfect","In general it is a good product, it pops up easily and collapses nicely for storage in the nylon bag that comes with it. There is a double zipper at the closure, and for a little added protection there is a rim of fabric that covers the zippers. The fabric is robust, it looks like it should last a long time. The thing I like least is that the sleeves on the front are quite close together, forcing meto pin my elbows to my waist while manipulating the film and reels; I find having my hands so close together is an awkward arrangement. If I had it to do over again I'd probably look for a similar product with side-mounted sleeves. That said, it does the job."
3,usual PC,Has most of his hits and is enjoyable to hear. I appear to be going back to older music lately so this fit right in with what I am doing.
3,Decent but too pricey,"I am fairly good at actionscript and the first 3 or four chapters were on design and variables, arrays, which I already know. Along the way they were giving other (not too great sites) a plug also. The best part is the actionscript that is already there. For one thing, I don't like to work in expert mode and this book demands it. Therefore you have to watch your syntax very carefully and it is a painstaking process. This book seems like there is only one way to actionscript in Flash (EXPERT) and I found that annoying because everything could be done in normal mode. I must admit the game is very cool and some of the code within the book is worth the money, but it leaves you lost in between. The XML for beginner section and some of the sound tips are good but be prepared to work in expert mode throughout this book which can be a real pain in the butt."
2,Average to Middling with Annoying Tone,The latter chapters are worthwhile however the tone of the book is annoying and condescending. This seems trivial but one wonders why the author(s) deliver content in this manner.
1,"never knew Boomboxes could blow up with smoke, odor/dead!","don't buy this awful device! (you get what you pay for!) literally, within 30 minutes of regular cd, then radio play, it blew up with dimming the lights in the room, a distinctive ""pop"" sound...a tiny plume of smoke... and an offensive odor!...then dead silence, no lights for c/d tracks...no radio sound! ...I am SOOO glad i gave it as an EARLY Christmas present.... one day after opening, i was Thank GOD, able to return it to amazon/target at no charge.... we'll see how long the refund takes to be credited!"
2,Magic hat,"My son wanted a top hat for Halloween, and this one looked to be just what he was wanting. However, the fit is very uncomfortable. And it is quite small. It would be advisable to add to the description that it is definitely for children, not teenagers or adults."
1,Hat stopped folding flat,"I'm a petite person and the hat fit on my head, but uncomfortably, because there were lots of hidden hinges and mechanisms inside the hat to make it fold flat. After opening and closing the hat a few times, it stopped folding flat, and would only stay in the open position. I was disappointed that I couldn't show off the ""magic"" part of the hat for halloween."
2,Works Well Until it Breaks,"Broke after only a few uses (wire won't stay taut). Worked well when it wasn't broken. Thought I just needed to replace the wire, but the broken part was actually an integral part of the slicer."
1,for use on soft chees only,Only used this a few times before it broke when slicing some hard Italian cheese. Cannot recommend the product.
3,Honda Hat--Flex Ca[,Nice quality made hat except the largest size available LG/XL runs small. I had to return it but received a full refund.
1,It's awful.,"In this work, Castronovo seems intent on fitting the larger facts of history into his personal PC matrix--a particularly appalling and self-righteous view of the world. Using words he doesn't quite seem to know the meaning of in what seems a desperate measure to impress, the work lingers limply to a conclusion that leaves the reader where she/he started from: a sense that Castronovo takes himself all too seriously and is incredibly anxious to prove his intellectual credentials. Has all the marks of ""written to secure tenure."""
2,Little disappointed,I was needing to make business cards for my husband's trucking business and found that there really wasn't much for clip art in the form of Semi's. I think if you were doing a different business card for something other than the trucking industry you will like it just fine.
2,Blah:(,not my favorite book im glad i got it cheaper because its not worth the money there could have been color pictures and they could have seperated the places better but its not that bad
1,Not recommended,"This book is not a complete as one would think. The authors at the beginning of the book list certain places that do not apply. So by their logic no Orwell's Oceania from ""1984"", Faulkner's Yoknapatawpha County, Thomas Hardy's Wessex, ""Metropolis"" and other places in the future are not included, and even some dystopian places like ones Zamyatin wrote about. There are just many other literary places one will not find in this book. I have read a great deal of literature, and if I were the editor of this book, I would label it ""incomplete."" The authors justifications for what they included were anemic. The illustrations are adequete at best.Another negative is the authors, after listing the literary source at the end of each entry, were too lazy to translate some of these foreign word titles into English. Not everyone knows French, Spanish, German, etc. This book was far less than I expected."
4,Great Shave But Shady Design,I was just given one as a gift and used it today. I can see it will take a little getting used to so I took it slow and easy. You don't use a lot of short strokes like a regular razor. Long strokes are what works best while using little pressure.I got a very close shave although I need some practice to get the sides good.They only negative that made me give it a 4 instead of 5 is the cartridge mounting system. There is no button to release the cartridge. You must carefully push it to the side too free one of the clips then pull it from the HB. The mounting bracket is plastic and will break with repeated use. Of course they sell replacements on the website but they charge $5.50 for THREE!Kinda shady but good product otherwise.Side note: There website says the new Rolex model ships with Gillete Sensor mounting clips. I plan on calling them to see if they can sell me some of those so I can use a better cartridge. They're not listed on the website.
5,The Power of Intuition,This CD got me really interested in Intuition healing and I really enjoyed the conversation with Deepak and Judith Orloff. Very easy to listen to.
3,THE SLOWER NUMBERS,"Of course Boney M were masters of dance in the late 1970's and early 1980's, but they did have some hits with ballads too. This collection includes the hits El Lute, Neil Young's Heart of Gold, Little Drummer Boy, Mary's Boy Child, I See A Boat On The River and of course their massive hit Rivers of Babylon (Originally done by The Melodians). But it's not really representative of their best music which included red-hot rabble rousing dancefloor sizzlers like Brown Girl In The Ring, Daddy Cool, Belfast and Ma Baker. To get all their best work together, I recommend The Greatest Hits album. Still, this collection is pleasant enough as an enjoyable memento of 70's/80's Europop in the Abba vein."
4,"Cute kitty, though smaller than expected.","This little cat is adorable, and we love it. The main drawback for us was that we were picturing something a bit larger for something listed as an 8"" stuffed toy.It's cute as a button, it just seems small."
5,Perfect,This idea is exactly how I expected it to be!!! It's very cuddaly and cute!!! It's small and perfect just to lay on ur bed during the day
1,Ughh... more like the worst cartoon in the world,"For a retro-style cartoon about a lazy bird, I was not expecting much from it. It was sad when it failed my already low expectations. The animation is poor and rather flat. Not much action, not much detail, not much of anything. Then the plotline. It withstood a whole 5 minutes before I turned the machine off. The dumb bird wants to design a webpage for a girl he likes but can't because some blobs creature called it first. Not very exciting. I was bored and annoyed by the crude jokes so much that I nearly threw up, and this was during the opening of the first episode. I guess if you enjoy lazy animation and writing, this should be at the top of your list."
3,JAD (Just A Disappointment),"This really SUCKS! They have the full first season, BUT they're SLACKING of 13 episodes on season 2!!!!!! And on the upcoming release 'The Best DVD In The World', there's 9 missing episodes in season 2 & 23 missing episodes in season 3!!!!!!! What the shiz man!!!!!!!??????? If I were you, I wouldn't get near it, I rated this 3-star. I would rather buy and download all episodes off amazon instant video & stream it on my iPad, tablet or kindle."
2,Enough With Partial Seasons CN!!!,"The final episode of the second season of Regular Show aired over a year ago, and the show is now into it's fourth season. At this rate DVD will be an obsolete format by the time they release full seasons. Same crap with Adventure Time. It's not like these discs are packed with extras. And where are the Hi Def versions? It's 2012, not 2002. Get with the program and stop milking the fans for every last dime. They have two great shows on their hands, and the demand is there. Imagine if other networks did this with their shows and released half seasons of LOST, Breaking Bad, etc?"
5,Great Present ever for a child!,I bought this item for one of my children and he LOVED IT!5 stars were given to this item because it simply is amazing!I recommend this to anyone! :-)
2,How shy women can attract shy men,"Not recommended unless you are incredibly shy and need help overcoming it. All this book does is basically teach a woman how to get a man to talk to her. And I'm sorry but the advice to ask a man for a date is just desparate. Read another book from someone with more real life experience such as ""How to Succeed with Men"" if you really want to find a quality man."
3,Alphorn Music,"I play the Alphorn and learned in Switzerland. This is ok. You can't expect a lot from an alphorn. It entertains the tourists but I can't say I would listen to it too often. If you like the sound, get a good french horn CD."
5,Live With Ludwig,"Step back in time and walk with Beethoven. This book and the second volume present so many facts and accurate details, that if you immerse yourself, reading and listening to his music, you can leave the here and now and all of its annoyances, float down Einstein's space-time continuum and live with Ludwig, the Master."
2,Middle of the road,"This album starts out fantastically -- ""Dreamline"" is easily one of the best songs the band has ever done, while ""Bravado"" and the title track maintain a high standard. But other than ""Heresy"" and the instrumental ""Where's My Thing"", the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock. Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the (near) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring. The completist will want to pick this up, but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages.[This review is based on the original 1991 release, not the 2004 remaster; the sound quality on the original is just fine.]"
3,Not their best,"This is the second Rush album I bought and I was a tad disappointed with it. There are quite a few good (not great) songs on this album, but I later found out that their earlier work was infinitely better. This album is worth checking out after you have listened to their earlier stuff and need more Rush. I think Rush is an amazing band. I just do not think that this album is indicative of the best they can do. (P.S. Is it just me, or is Neurotica a terrible song?)"
4,Entering the nineties,"This cd has three songs on it which were played on the radio quite a bit. Dreamline, which is the opening song, is a really good one nice echo guitar work and keyboards. Roll the Bones was played quite a bit, too. It's a little funky( a little annoying in one part but still is an outstanding track. Ghost of a chance is another song which got a lot of airplay. Good guitar line with excellent slowdown part which helps the song rise above the others. The rest of the cd is good with perhaps the weakest track being neurotica.It's not a great cd but has some solid cuts on it."
4,90's RUSH,"I Think every RUSH albumn is worth owning.The song ""Roll the Bones"" is very good even with the little rap section.""Dreamline"" is my favorite song on the CD and it is one of the best songs By RUSH that I have heard.Every RUsh CD has something on it that I like and that is ALOT more than I can say about alot of Rock Bands.I think ""Moving Pictures"" is hard to top. ""Counterparts"" and ""test for echo"" are my favorite RUSH cd's from the 90's era.At First I diddnt like most of the songs on this CD,But after a few more spins I like most of the record.It is one of those CD's that has to grow on you a bit.Neil Peart shows off his talent alot on this CD.I think this CD has some of Pearts best drum work."
2,A middle-of-the-road effort,"This album starts out fantastically -- ""Dreamline"" is easily one of the best songs the band has ever done, while ""Bravado"" and the title track maintain a high standard. But other than ""Heresy"" and the instrumental ""Where's My Thing"", the rest of the album is forgettable mainstream rock. Though fans of the 70s material may appreciate the (near) absence of synthesizers they might still find parts of this CD to be extremely boring. The completist will want to pick this up, but most of the good songs from this album are available on the live set Different Stages."
4,A very differnt kind of mother,"This is one of troma's earliest movies, a very good low budget horror/revenge movie. There is little blood and gore when compared to troma's other classics like the toxic avenger but this one has a very good story to match. A backwoods mother orders her boys to kill,while she watchs and approves. They kidnap 3 city girls and abuse 1 to the point of death. The remaining 2 must now take revenge for their fallen comrade, and revenge they take. Most of the blood shed take place at the end, with 1 scene in the very begining. While watching you feel for the girls and really want them to put this deranged family in there place(which they do). The ending was unexpected(who thought the old lady was telling the truth,not I for one) watch and you will see what i mean. Recomended for fans of revenge/exploitation horror but and fan of the horror genre in general will enjoy this movie."
1,B-Movie Quality,"If you have nothing else to do and want a slasher movie to watch, then this is the winner. Set in the sticks, with a crazy mother and her two boys, this movie gives you reasons why going into the woods alone is a bad idea."
4,Nice,"Freaky, gross, disgusting, disturbing, and delicious. If you are a fan of horror, definitely give it a whirl."
3,Disturbingly horrific but oddly compelling,"This film has an almost documentary feel to it. The low budget only adds to the realism. It's in line with Texas Chainsaw Massacre as far as the gritty feel, realistic actors, and brutal scenes are concerned. It is not as good as Texas Chainsaw Massacre though. I revisit this every so often for reasons I am still unsure of. I wish a good widescreen version would come out, if it even exists in that format. Also, it may be 80s but it sure feels 70s. Check it out."
1,very disappointed,This product looks much better in the picture than in person. The brush looks very full in the picture but actually very sparce in person. Bristles already started falling out before I even used it. It comes unwrapped just thrown in a plastic bag for shipping.
5,Simple Review,"This is a tastefully done concept type presentation of the events of Septemebr 11, 2001. The video puts all of the horrible events of that day in chonological order, while at the same type demonstrating the tragedy, and the heroism.The film is not long, but it will bring every emotion the viewer posses quickly to the surface. This film was concieved of and made by Americans who just wanted to make sure we have an accurate documentation of those events. After Hollywood and screenwriters eventually someday produce their versions of events, we will all have this documentary to go to for the facts, eyewitness expressions, and honest uncensored narration.It is clear these folks are not interested in making money from this video. I think it would market at a much higher price:I applaud the producers and their efforts in accomplishing something I believe the public has been wanting for several months."
2,That droning voice,"Video is great, I've learned to watch it without the audio turned up. The audio just has to go ... monotonous droning that often has little to do with what is on the screen. The New York footage is good, but the Washington DC (Pentagon) just leaves me unimpressed. There are better DVDs out there, this one is only for collector's value, if that."
2,Not a Del Mar authentic one,"I'm afraid that Del Mar series is experiencing a lack of creativity and, to make matters worse, is forgetting the authentic and original ""balearic sound"" which masters like Jose Padilla and Bruno created in last years of last century. The series quality has evolved downwards since 2-CD box were introduced in Vol.12. It seems that threshold standards to appear in Del Mar had relaxed in order to get more songs. In Vol.14, we can listen sounds more close to other succesful series like Buddha Bar or even groove compilations. Please, don't get me wrong: I also love Buddha Bar and many others. But when I buy another Cafe del Mar disc, I'm looking for this unique style offered in Cafe del Mar, at least the style Cafe del Mar used to offer until vol. 11"
1,CDM buyer beware!,I have almost all CDM and this is a big let down. Some of the tracks are downright awful. You'd have been better off purchasing Dreams Vol 4--it's much better. This series will be over if it continues down this path.
5,Everythings on this one CD,"Bette's back in the studio,turning out fantastic music once again.Everythings on this CD,from rock and roll,to beutifull ballads,and the campy songs Bette always makes special.The CD starts out with a short,wonderfull,pop song,""One more Round,""then leads into one of my favorites from the album,Janis Ian's,""Some people's lives.""The way Bette sings this song breaks your heart.Then Bette gets back to her roots with ""Miss Otis Regrets."" I remember Bette singing this on Johnny Carson's last show.There's no one like her.The biggest hit,""From a Distance,"" is a masterpiece.This song was out during the war,and helped everyone pull together.""Some People's Live's"" is one of Bette's greatest records.I still play this CD once in awhile,and never get tired of it."
1,Someone was asleep during release of this CD.,I want this CD!!! This review is just a warning to folks who try to purchase it.I have tried to order this CD three times and every time it arrives I pop it in my player only to discover that it is not 'Some People's Lives' but the 'Beaches Soundtrack'. This is real annoying. The label and jacket identifies this as 'Some People's Lives' but it is not. Atlantic Records really screwed this one up.
4,"Overall, Thumbs Up","I was a Slowdive fan before Mojave 3. It took some time for me to enjoy every Mojave 3 record after the release of ""Ask Me Tomorrow."" It took me quite a few listenings until I really connected with the music.This record is no exception.Let it play for a while and you will hear this really is a good record. Thats why I always buy a new Mojave 3 album when it comes out. I know that eventually I will really like it.*sidenote* Track 12 is of utmost quality. It think track 12 should appeal to many of the Slowdive and ""Ask Me Tomorrow"" fans. Drop the 15 bucks and buy this record."
3,3.5 stars actually,"They traded in their acuostic guitars for electric ones. That's not to say, howerver, that this is an electric album. On their past albms they would fill their songs with acoustic rhythm and punctuate them with well timed electric leads or wonderfully jaunty piano riffs. On this album they have (for the most part) replaced the acoustic rhythm with electric rhythm and somewhere along the way the songs got a little lost in the translation. Clean toned electric guitars against a backdrop of, you guessed, clean toned electric guitars, there's no room for the songs to breath, there's nowhere for them to go, there's no fight in them.I am a die hard Mojave 3 fan, so for me to write such a critical review is a hard thing for me to do, but take this into account... it still got a 3.5 from me, now that's saying something."
1,No one could listen to this.,"This is a review of the audiobook only. School is ended and until summer camp starts, my 8 year old daughter has to go to work with me. I stocked up on audiobooks to keep her busy. We both were really excited about the one on Teddy Roosevelt, and started with it first. I set her up listening in the lunchroom and I went back to work. After 5 minutes she showed up in my office saying that there was something wrong with the tape, like it was in slow motion. We played it on another cassette player. We played the other tapes. They're all the same. Lloyd James reads this book one syllable at a time and sounds like a 5 year old that is trying to sound out every word. It goes so unnaturally slow that I thought the cassette spool must be warped. One star is too high."
5,My daughter loved it,"I purchased it for my daughter for Christmas, she loved it, saidshe always wanted it"
1,the usual suspects,"I remember Ebert complaining that the problem with the twist at the end of The Usual Suspects was that it negated the film - that nothing in the movie actually really happened. True enough, but the tale spun in The Usual Suspects was so entertaining that it didn't matter. Fascinating characters, excellent dialog and action. The same trick is employed here but it's not effective because: a) the trick was not done well, b) the characters are absolutely inane and the acting is appalling. I'm concerned that people who find this brilliant are hankering for something so intellectually robust that they can elevate themselves to a state of intelligencia by ""getting it"". There's nothing worth ""getting"" here, folks. It's a poorly planned mind-trick that is just not interesting enough to be worth the effort."
2,I Must Have Not Seen Something...,"This movie started off on a slow but understandable pace, although the actors I considered wooden and uninteresting except maybe for the college student himself because you wanted to know what was going on with him.Yet as this movie progresses instead of building up to some answers all you get left with are many more questions and thus stop enjoying the movie and just growing irratated with it. You have no idea what is really going on and in the end it is just one huge twist that will leave you bitter you even picked up this movie in the first place.So yes maybe I missed something- I must have since many of the reviews on this film are glowing. Yet I will not lie- I did not understand the film. Hardly did I ever and I don't plan on watching it again. I do not recommend this film."
4,"good, but not mind-blowing","I liked it... I don't think it was a waste of time like a lot of people are reporting, but I also don't think it's a brilliant piece of art like others feel. It was just a good, interesting movie. The ending threw me off, and I was disappointed that nothing seemed to be solved. But then I went on the IMDB message boards and watched the special documentary on near death experiences and everything was clearer to me. I think you need to watch this movie more than once (the same goes for I Love Your Work--an utterly underrated, weird film as well) to really get it. And I plan on doing just that =P"
2,it was weird..,"this movies started off really interesting,then it went kinda weird an hour into it.I spent most of the time trying to figure the movie out ,but i guess that was part of the fun.It was just reaaaalllly trippy to watch some of the scenes in this movie, i felt creeped out at times and confused about where it was going...all and all it was okay, but the feeling i got watching it was very interesting.I aggree with the others that the visuals were awesome and the mood was perfect for the film.But it still seemed somewhat boring at times and definetly hard to follow."
2,Stay the Movie,When i got this movie the plastic cover was torn on the back like it had been used but was suppose to be NEW. I would not buy from this person again.
