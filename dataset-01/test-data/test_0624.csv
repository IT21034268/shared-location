4,We love this gate!!,"We bought this gate for a opening between our foyer and kitchen. We ended up buying one extension and are very pleased!!! We put it together in about 30 minutes. It's great because you can bend it into whatever configuration you need. For us, we were hesitant to drill into our walls but didn't have another solution. Now that it's installed, we definitely feel like the safety and convenience factors far outway the problem of drilling into our walls. I definitely recommend this gate!!"
4,Works well,"Works exactly as shown in the picture. Installation was easy, make sure you read the directions for hints on how to make the screw holes right the first time. The only downside is that the gate piece cannot be moved to the end, it has to be between the other two pieces. For my stairway it would have been very helpful to move the gate to the end, but that is no possible."
5,Best for Hard To Fit areas!!,I have an area that is unusually hard to fit for a baby gate. This is the only gate that would work for me! You really can bend each little 2 foot section any which way to fit your needs. The gate part is easy enough for my older kids but also difficult enough for the little ones to stay put. I would've been lost without this gate!
4,Intriguing,"Very good movie. Genuine acting from all. Enjoyed the plot, and was surprised by the ending. Would recommend this film."
4,Good Watch!,Had seen on tv before and remembered it was a good watch so decided to order the dvd. Watched it again and yes it was a good watch.
1,I cant believe I paid for this!!!!!,"I wish you could return DVD's you have already opened cause this would go right back to the store, Beyonce is one of the worst actors I have ever seen right up there with J-Lo and Paris Hilton, I mean come on the only reason why she is in the movie is because she is one of the Executive producers along with her father. If you look at the credits she's the only one who has her very own makeup artist, dresser and hair stylist. She needs to stick to a microphone and leave the acting to the profesionals, money can buy a lot of things but I dont think there is any amount of money that can buy Beyonce an acting career, hopefully this was a learning experience for her. Ali Larter's performance was a little to dramatic but not over played with the one liners as Beyonce. Over all I would like the $16 I spent back on this as well as the 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life back."
3,I didn't hate it,"Though there is absolutely no character development whatsoever, I was still entertained. Ali Larter had crazy down pat there was just no rhyme or reason to what was going on. I still dont know what happened in that hotel room. Whether he slept with her or not. Why she didn't contact him while he spent 3 months out of the house--or at least attempt to get rid of the wife doing that time. There seem to be a lot of TV actors doing this TV director a favor for his first motion picture. Heck, we all have to start somewhere. I didn't think Beyonce was horrible, but she wasn't great either. But hey we live in a world where Madonna has a Golden Globe--so anything is possible for her acting career. Especially since she goes out of her way to perform at every Oscar show now. But back to this movie. Overall I found it entertaining for a knock off of every revenge of the crazy flick that had come before it."
5,APC Replacement Battery,This is a perfect match for the original APC replacement battery at a fraction of the cost. Why would you buy anything else?
1,Digital Printmaking - out of date,This is no longer a good book. Its too out of date and is in serious need of a good overhaul. Look for something else.
4,Blue Skin of the Sea,"The book Blue Skin of the sea is a great book. ... This book is about a young Hawaiian boy who grew up on the ocean but does not like it. Sonny goes through many obstacles, which include meeting mean people, being made fun of, and losing a girlfriend. During the book you hear about Sonny's whole family including his mother who just had passed away. ""Don't ever do that again"", this was a quote that Sonny always remembered but never knew who said it and why. Overall this was a very well written novel."
4,Great but not perfect,This edition has a lot in it but there's few important things missing.1. The movies don't have lossless audio. This a disgrace because the individual releases already had lossless audio. So no reason to mess around here.2. It would have been great if the long individual releases of the movies would have been available here or even as a deleted scenes.3. This doesn't include the clean version of Planet Terror without all the scratches etc. Of course the scratched one is the right one but no reason not to include the other version cos' the individual release had that as an extra.4. I also think that the packaging could have been more inspired.
5,One word: amazing!,"This is an amazing movie project by the fantastic duo Robert Rodriguez and Quentin Tarantino. And, yes, the Machete fake trailer is included. As for the sound quality discussed, I don't care. I'm just thrilled to finally get to see the theatrical version of this grindhouse project!"
4,Would be 5 star if it weren't 3 hours long ...,"You get what you expect as far as I'm concerned.If this is your first Tarantino movie, you're movieologically handicapped.Same goes for Rodriquez films. I mean for Pete's sake, the guy has made everything from High School monster movies, to Stripper Vampires, to a movie about a kid named ""Sharkboy"" that comes from a pool game the guy and his kid play. He got Stallone to make one of his best movie appearances since, like Rambo 2!!!!Cool Zombie movie with hot chicks and guns.Cool action movie with hot chicks driving muscle cars.Witty trailers for movies yet to be released. And did you notice what the killer was doing at the end of the ""Thanksgiving"" trailer. I almost crapped my pants I laughed so hard!!!Camp, comedy, cursing, and killing. This maketh a movie of greatness. However; what were they thinking when they released this on ""Good Friday"". Very, very unsmartishness there. Hope the DVD release plan is smarter."
5,"Finally, the way these films were meant to be seen!","I had the privilege of seeing Grindhouse with a packed house of movie eager movie watchers and it was an experience that was unlike any other!I was very disappointed with the decision to split these releases and remove many of the great fake trailer that were included in the original theatrical release!I am very excited that the decision has been made to finally release the original double feature, fake trailers and all!"
2,I don't recommend buying this.,"If you have the seperate films already on blu ray this set its not for you because the only new things are a cooking school segment with Robert Rodriguez (which is on all his dvds), and some making of the trailers which you could probably find on youtube. Not only that but the older blu-ray copies have lossless audio and for some reason this set doesn't. Who wants a set with lossy audio? If you don't have either of the films yet and you don't have surround sound or HDMI compatible sound on your TV then get this set, But the separate releases are actually better."
3,Meh,I really won't know if this product works unless I try to set it on fire so...But it does come with a silica gel pack so make sure you keep that with your valuables to keep it from getting wet. I bought another set just in case and keep that in there too and have not had issues other raters are complaining about.
1,Do Not Buy This Box,"We bought this exact box under the Honeywell brand. The other reviews about ""wet documents"" are right on. Even with moisture absorbers, documents became moist. The lock failed with 30, or so, opens. It only took a light tug, with an inserted screwdriver, to defeat the PLASTIC locking mechanism. I can't think of one positive reason to recommend this box...so, I won't."
4,Has suited our needs perfectly,"We have had no complaints with this changing table. Of course, it's our first baby (and table) so we don't have much to compare it to. The drawer is convenient and easy to pull out, and the 2 shelves add lots of storage space. I like how the sides come up around baby. I can't imagine using a dresser top where baby could so easily fall off. Yes, it was hard to put together, but what piece of baby furniture or toy isn't? The one problem we had putting it together was when we were trying to put the casters (the wheels) into the pre-drilled holes on the bottom of the table legs, we started splitting the wood on one of the legs. We decided to forego the wheels since we leave it in one spot anyway. If your heart is set on having wheels, our wood splitting goof would make you unable to use wheels."
1,Very Poor Workmanship/Quality,"Unless you are ready to spend considerable time assembling this item, forget about it. For the price it had the worst overall finish I've ever encountered with any piece of furniture. That's a statement considering all the cheap furniture I've had when in college. Don't expect even IKEA style finish. All fits were rough and out of alignment. I had to realign every single screw hole. I guarantee this will outlast anything now that I've spent 20 hours putting it together. If the store wasn't so far away I would have taken it back. As it is, I will not buy any more of this companies furniture regardless of look or price in the store."
3,Waiting to see if it was worth the hassle....,"We picked this changing table because it matched our Babi Italia crib and we liked the fact that it had the drawer in it for storage. However, after waiting 8 weeks for the item to arrive from backorder we were extrememly dissapointed to find that we were missing several pieces of hardware needed to assemble the table. We attempted to contact the company and had to leave multiple voicemails in order to get a reply. Finally, I spoke to a live person and was told that they would ship the missing screws immediately- 2 weeks later I am still waiting for them, and follow up calls to the company have been greeted with a cold shoulder. I only hope that when the screws finally arrive we don't have any of the problems that earlier reviewers have had with assembly! Babi Italia definitely needs to improve their customer service for consumers...."
5,Great book!,"Great book, very detailed and informative. The only shortcoming is I wish it had more pictures. Other than that, a great buy!"
4,Good Insight - still relevant!,"This book is a recent reprint by OSR but I was lucky enough to have it in my library some seven years ago. There you have it, it is an old book, but is it still relevant today. I think it is. The underlying windows file system (NTFS) has not changed that much for the windows.Be warned that if you are new to kernel development, this book is probably not for you. A better starting point for a beginner would be ""Windows NT Device Driver Development (OSR Classic Reprints)"". Reading the book did feel abrupt sometime and probably lacks a good flow. I also remember some of the theories / hypotheses put forward by the author has been challenged elsewhere( OSR file system forums). Nevertheless it is a good reference book. I highly recommend it."
1,Fell apart the first day I used it!!,Either way this was only $1.99 for the charger not a deal but I just went ahead and dealt with because it was so cheap!!! But just bought another one but it's a home charger might have better luck! I guess! lol But I would just reccommend the home charger instead of the car charger!
4,The architecture of the future,"With the movement of enterprise developement towards Microsoft DNA, this book is a must for system architects. The book mainly outlines the important decisions necessary to tackle MTS and IIS development in a multi-tier solution.The book is not the best resource for a developer though as it doesn't present the 'how' to the detail level required. (VB) Developers, I suggest you also look at 'Programming Distributed Applications with COM and Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0' and (to a lesser extent the associated training kit) 'Distributed Applications for Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 MCSD Training Kit'. Future: Microsoft if making major changes in how to develop enterprise solutions in the next version of Visual Studio. Reviewer: Andrew Richards MCSD."
1,Source code not working,"If you want to learn ISAPI programming, getting this book might help little."
4,mama72303,i ordered the jenny lind dressing table because it was fairly inexpensive and it looks nice. i was very pleased when it was shipped very quickly and having an already ten month old baby speed was of importance. the table was very easy to assemble. it barely took fifteen minutes. it also looks great and its at the perfect height to change babies. my back feels great since i got it. the only problem is the weight limit is only twenty pounds and my baby weighed twenty pounds when he was five months old. it was easy to reinforce the shelve so it could hold more weight.
3,Not bad for the price,"The changing table has held up pretty well except we have to tighten the screws every month because it becomes a bit ""rickety"". Still well worth the price."
3,Good but...,"This changing table is great, it allows my daughter to be at the perfect height for a change. The biggest problem that I have with the table is actually with the shelves, they do not stay in place. The shelves constantly fall out of the grooves and have to be replaced. I am going to have to reinforce the shelves in order actually be able to place anything on them."
3,"Inexpensive, not durable","Inexpensive, small juggling balls. Stitching is poor quality, so not durable. But good for kids to learn with."
2,Not good for juggling,"I used this to practice juggling for a couple of months, and actually learned the basics. Eventually I figured out it was a mistake to use this type of balls for a simple reason: Too light.You need a little weight so that you'll have more control in your throws/catches. It is a lot better to buy lacrosse balls for $1.99/each. Another alternative is to stuff tennis balls with rice as I did."
2,"Too complicated, suction hurts!!!","I hated this pump. I ended up giving it away to my sister. I used it once and the suction totaly hurt even when I would just suction very gently. It was hard to put back together once it came apart. It has too many parts to work with. I use the Medela Manual Pump and I love that one so much better. The bottle works great though. I bought so many of these bottle cause they are great. My son didn't like the Playtex nipples so these are a great alternative, and I love the Gerber disposable bags for breastmilk they fit perfect in these bottles."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PUMP!,"After reading many reviews on pumps, I decided to buy this one, thinking that it would work great. On the contrary, it didn't work for me at all. The first one I got kept leaking so I returned it and got a new one. The same thing happened with the second one. Breastmilk kept getting between the pump and the plastic cap that goes over it and that you placed against your breast. It was so frustrating that it never worked! So I finally just returned it too and bought the electric Purely Yours pump from Ameda. That one actually works!"
5,Better than my electric hospital grade double pump,I rented the Medela Lactina Select from the hospital and it was fine. I bought this manual pump to have as an extra while traveling. I tested it out to make sure I knew how to use it before we went away. I like this pump so much better than my double electric! I pumped more and faster! I returned the hospital pump and this is the only pump I use.
4,Good - for a manual pump.,"This is a great manual pump and can work very well. It stimulates let down within a minute or less for me. It takes a bit of practice but once you get the hang of it it works well. However, it is kind of a pain to clean and take apart. It is also unbalanced on the bottle and always seems to tip over. I also have a Pump N Style which is much quicker and easier. This is a good option for occasional use though or if you want to pump on one side while baby feeds on the other (easier than PNS because the tubes get in the way)."
1,Disappointed,"This pump was simply NO GOOD. As a first time mother, I tried and tried and even solicited help from a nurse. I ended up renting one from the hospital, which was great and wasted all the money spent on this.I would talk to your pediatric nurse for suggestions before spending a lot of money on this brand."
5,excellent pump!!,"I bought this pump while I was pregnant with my first baby because the price was great. I didn't know the Avent name at the time, but now it's the only one I would use along with all the bottles and sippy cups! I recommend this to everyone of my friends having babies. It is comfortable and easy to use for a manual pump. This was the first pump I bought so I didn't have to go through a bunch of expensive hard to use pumps. I've never used an electric pump so I don't know how it compares, but people I've talked to say this is much better than a lot of the electric pumps on the market. I was very happy with this one and it met all my needs. I could pump 5-10 ounces in less than 5 minutes. All the pieces come apart very easily for washing and go back together easily as well. It travels well too!Great Great item!!! I'll be using it again in a month when my second baby arrives!"
4,Fascism in Italy well presented,Solid understanding of the rise of Mussolini but somewhat tilted without stating that initially many welcomed the public works phase. The government under Mussolini incorporated the traditional under the table bribery and alliances with power brokers.S.J.Tagliareni author of Hitler's Priest
3,Look elsewhere for a casual read,"The erudition displayed by other reviewers (despite the need for spell checking in one case) indicates well that this is a book for scholars. It said hardly anything about the lives of the ordinary people, as compared with the litany of name-dropping and fact quoting. This is not to be critical, just a warning to those who are interested in the subject and don't want to doze off every two pages. I certainly admire the effort put forth by the author, but if you're an ordinary guy like I am you might opt for some other source."
4,Great Camera. Ideal for home use,"The camera is all that i expected. Low cost, great optical zoom and great resolution. It is ideal for home made pictures and landescapes. The Optical zoom works perfectly.The Internal Memory have a great capacity for storage, and the menus are so easy to use. Great interface.The only thing that i dislike, is the fact that it doesn't bring the xD card, nor the Rechargable battery."
3,"Great Image Quality, But Too Small","This camera is a great travel camera, but it's too small for taking close-ups or telephoto shots. I prefer the Olympus cameras with 4 AA batteries (rechargable). They're much easier to hold steady when photographing a flower or distant object.There's such a thing as too small and this camera has surpassed my limit. If not yours, pick it up. Olympus cameras are the best."
3,Olympus Camedia D535,"The camera is pretty good for its price. It was my first digital camera and was pretty good but now I'm looking to upgrade only because indoor pictures, even in well lit areas look very dim. Also I have to keep playing around with the settings in order for it to take a picture at all indoors, and it often times takes a really long time to actually take the picture. You have to have very steady hands in order for night mode/close up mode not to blur. It takes a bit of practice. Also I found the video to be quite pointless since there was no sound to it. Also I tried to take firework pictures, but that was a disaster. Pictures are excellent outdoors, and sometimes the bluriness during night photos can give an interesting effect...sometimes.It's very easy to use though, and I usually brighten up dim pictures easily in Paint Shop Pro."
4,aire libre,It's a good movie.The scenery is beautiful. It's a movie where you can see the respect for nature and different traditions.
2,Not quite everything,"A lot of repetitious platitudes about the philosophy (feminine viewpoint) of writing blogs. Very little on how to do it. Where do I get blogging software? How about some reviews of blogging software? How do I set up a blog web site? How do I set up ""RSS feed""?. Or for that matter why do I want an ""RSS Feed""? I'm not a dummy or a complete idiot since I do maintain some web sites and can write JSP, Java Script, and am reasonably adept with Dreamweaver. I also passed three English courses at a presitgious university. So If I can't write, it's my own fault. But I sure cannot do a blog without more information than I gained from this book."
3,Strange approach of human cult,It doesn't matter whether Jesus Lived in India or not. It really matters if you doesn't understand the light of the world . Jesus is the one who knows about the light and could communicate with. Every one in the world is a son of God. But how better you know about the truth is important. It is the direct communication with the creator. This book is meant for a rational thinker who doesn't mind reading any kind of stuff. It may be or maynot be right(doesn't matter). It is true that the ancient rulers destroyed most of the sacred documents. They never realized about the truth lying in the documents. And Once you know about the creator then you will never search for anything else. Your soul is set free by him for a preliminary test.You have to clear so many test to communicate with him . Best of luck
4,Fire It Up,"Well first, the track listing above it totally wrong. The songs are all out of order. Anyways, this cd was really good, but also different from all the other KMK stuff. More light and happy then other stuff then they have done before. The best songs to me on the cd are :Bring It On, Angry Youth, Bad Habits,Down 4 Tha Krown, and Live To Day: The bonus tracks are very much more to me, they aren't up to par as other songs on the cd. I like Richter on this cd and some of D-Loc isnt that good. Although this cd is not as agressive, or dark as other albums they have released it is still one that you should get if your Down 4 Tha Krown."
2,parrot time,"Having read all the positive reviews, I purchased this book. I don't know, I just didn't get it - it was slow moving and a bit boring."
3,Nice overview of the industry,"The author did a very thorough job writing this book. This book is primarily oriented to the long term, buy and hold type. This is not a ""trading"" book. The author provides very detailed information (perhaps too detailed) on the sector which may confuse some readers (to their own peril). This book provides a good overview for how to approach investing in the sector -- but thats about it. Book is also a bit dated. Overall good."
2,Hoyle Game Crazy,I love Hoyle Puzzle & Board Games 2007. I had the other versions and loved them but this is much more advanced. I play them every chance I get and love spending the Hoyle Bucks. I'm addicted I tell you...addicted!!!
1,Unfunny.,"This book, intended for children, is the dumbest joke book I have ever read. The jokes are forced, unfunny, and rely on loose puns. No child would enjoy any joke in this book, and I'd recommend avoiding it."
1,For the love of God!,"This man has spent half of his life blasting one of his many critics, Steve Kaplan - late parapsychologist/schoolteacher - for his hobby of researching modern day humans who claim to be vampires, but this phony then promotes a book about werewolfs! You cannot have it both ways, Ed!"
4,AMAZING SURF AND GREAT MUSIC!,"Wow, this is amazing surf. With great rock music. Forget about alley-oops, air-360s and crap pennywise-like music that infest surf videos today. This is flowing surfing, carving surfing, tubes and huge curves and carves on great waves. Occy is the star in both movies and man, he surfs great here, specially the st. leu reunion islands segment on ""pump"". The music is great, from concrete blonde to some bands you have never heard about but should. Get it while you can. I don't give five stars to this because it does not seem to be a official billabong re-release and it is definetely not a factory-pressed silver disc DVD. But hey, if this is the only way to get these movies on DVD, so I take it!"
5,mikasmom,"This is a wonderful mattress pad!! Not only does it have a waterproof backing, but it's thick and soft and adds a nice cushion for baby to sleep on. For the most part, mattresses are hard. I love the softness this adds for my daughter (she has slept better since I purchased it) and the protection it offers the mattress."
1,Didn't hold up after first wash,"I bought this pad thinking I could get comfort with the securty of waterproofing. I was wrong. I bought two of these pads, washed them for the first time, and they both had holes in the plastic. I can't imagine what they're going to look like in a few months.Spend your money elsewhere."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I ordered this and I will return this ASAP.Maybe I just imagined it differently but I`m very dissapointed.I wanted something that is soft and cotton,but this is just another layer of plastic.The mattress is already waterproof so why use this.I know my baby would just sweat on this (something I was trying to avoid.Do yourself and your baby a favor and buy a wool pad or sheepskin.You will be a lot happier with it and I`m sure it`s a lot healthier."
3,It's a good deal but has issues...,"This set is a good deal because you get the bag, bottles, pump, ice packs, etc. all in one. The pump is easy to clean and can be stored in the bag which is a nice touch. My daughter likes the nipples and there are a variety of proucts that go with this Avent line.I have had this set for 6 months. My daughter is breastfeed 99% of the time but on occation she takes a bottle if I'm out. I have used the pump to store some milk in the freezer for emergencies. Using this pump is time consuming and a little tough at first. It sometimes doesn't get a great suction and doesn't cause a good letdown. If you are a breastfeeding mom who is only going to use this pump on occation it is a good choice. If you are going to be doing a lot of pumping I wouldn't suggest that this is the one to get. Something electric is a much better way to go."
1,Not worth the money,"I was told from many new moms that this was the best pump out there. I, myself couldn't get even a drop with this pump. I tried it again about a month after my daughter was born, really hoping that it was only ""user error"" the first time around. No such luck though. I eventually just put this in the back of my closet and spent the money on a good electric pump (I like my Ameda purely yours). I really wish I would have just saved my money and bought the Electric the first time around. Mom's... pumps are one item that are worth the extra money and time it takes to research the best ones. I learned this the hard way."
1,Don't waste your money on an Avent Pump,"I researched and the avent pump got great online reviews, but I found it to be frustrating, time consuming and with mimimal gentle use, it finally broke. It is hard to get and keep a good suction. This was very frustrating. There are a lot of parts and it needs to be taken apart and washed after every use, so in a rush...well, don't be in a rush because you will immediately be dissatisfied. Not to mention, trying to remember what part goes where, and the parts are hard plastic and break easily. Avent must know this since they include a few extra pieces in the on the go kit, but they didn't include the piece that broke on mine. This didn't even happen with frequent use. I used my pump 10-20 times over the course of 7 months before it was finally too broken to use at all. My recommendation is not to buy this product, go with a medela. I had to purchase a second pump and I am much happier with it."
1,"Great system, but...","I think the Isis system is wonderful, and I love the convenient carrier and extra bottles included. My only caveat, which unfortunately is a dealbreaker, is that the Isis does not accommodate women with, ahem, larger breasts/nipples. The ""horn"" is only available in one size from Avent and caused me great pain when expressing milk on a recent vacation (stupidly, I did not test the system before we left home).(...)"
5,EXCELLENT product very very comfortable!!!,"After trying a dual electric pump that was very uncomfortable for me I tried the Isis berast pump and never looked back. I could not control the suction with the electric pump and, however with the Isis I was able to control the pressure and was able to completely empty both breasts in less than 20 minutes total. The cushioning made the pump very comfortable. And my hand never got tired from manually pumping. I used this product years ago with my daughter and I am adding it to my registry for my second child. I highly recommend this for anyone who would like to continue breast feeding.Follow-up: My youngest daughter is now six weeks old and I still love this pump. Its a moust-have for breastfeeding mothers."
4,A little messy...,"I had this pump with my first child back in 2003 and I worked great for when I was at work but it was messy. The milk always seemed to leak out underneath the plastic insert, so I took that out and it helped a little bit. I also had probably with the pump maybe working a little TOO WELL and would stimulate my ""let down"" and so it was a panic to keep myself from wetting my shirt on the other breast I wasn't pumping, while I kept pumping and answered phones! I was a night receptionist so I just pumped away while working.I like that it comes with a bag that is nice and stylish. I saved this and I will use it with my next baby due in Sept. 2009."
1,Dismal Failure,"The Isis pump did not work for me. I don't really have a problem with that since every person is different and different products work better for different people. What I have a problem with is this company's response to any criticism of their products. I've seen it over and over again. With their pumps, bottles and sippy cups. If they fail to meet to basic standards (like the sippy cups not leaking), it's because you're too stupid to follow their directions. Please! Their arrogance and lack of customer service when responding to their lackluster products is so insulting I had to write an online review which I've never done before. Do yourself a favor and find another company to fulfill your family's need."
4,back to work mom,"I recently went back to work, and was unsure if I was going to be able to still breast feed my son. I bought the Isis breast pump and haven't had a problem keeping up with his needs. I liked it so much I went out and bought a second pump just to help the process go faster. The only problem I have had with the pump is I cracked one of the funnels, and you can't find them in the stores, you have to order new parts online and wait for them to be shipped. Other than that it is a great system."
3,Good but looking for better...,"A good pump but I am looking for something that is more efficient. It is quiet and you can control the suction which makes it gentle on your breasts. However it requires some time to express. It takes me 20 mins to express 4 ounces! I suppose I can go faster but then it becomes uncomfortable and leaves my nipples sore. I find I must lean forward for the milk to collect in the container, otherwise it leaks out of the breastshell. Maintaining this forward slightly haunched position hurts my back. Finally it really annoys me that the containers don't attach to the pump well and they become loose, even leaking if you don't constantly tighten them. I guess maybe that's why I can't pump as quickly as most becuase I have to stop so often to make adjustments. Overall not a bad pump but be aware that it is not perfect. I will have to get a more efficient pump for when I go back out to work"
1,SAVE your Money.....,"I purchased this pump knowing I would be going back to work after my 12 weeks of leave. I quickly found out that this pump was not efficient and it took way to much time to even pump a 4oz bottle. It would be fine if you had 2 hours to pump at your job, however most supervisors like ya to be working when you're on the clock.All of my friends told me, whatever you do buy an electric breast pump, it's well worth the money. After looking at the prices, I opted not to take their advice...I ended up wasting 60 dollars on this pump as I later purchased the back pack style pump. It was expensive but well worth the money and payed for itself. It allowed me to go back to work and continue giving my son breastmilk until he was 8 months old. I never would have lasted with this ridiculous piece of equipment.So my advice to all you, is Don't Waste Your money on this pump and go with the electric breast pump...you'll be very glad you did."
3,B-size beware!,"If you are small busted, read this! I am a size B post-pregnancy. After 4-5 days, the massaging pad blistered my skin on the areola. After calling Avent and taking a week off, I now use it without the massaging pad. I also went from 2 oz per side to 3-4 oz per side. I am a stay-at-home mom, and pump one side every morning to have some milk on hand. Listen to your Dr and friends and use an electric if going back to work.Also, this is not ""whisper quiet"". The handle sqeaks! Avent even sent me a replacement handle, but no improvement."
5,Great Pump,"I bought this pump because I didn't want to spend [the money] on the Medula if I didn't have to. I have not been sorry. I'm able to express 5 to 6 ounces in less than 10 minutes. My son is 6 months old and I've never had any problems. The pump never hurts, it's easy and convenient and after you use it a few times putting it together is no problem. I work part-time and the Avent Isis has been great! I don't have to worry about proximity to an electrical outlet and it is very quiet. I also love all of Avent's bottles and sippy cups all of which can be used in conjuction with the Isis pump. I would highly recommend this pump to anyone."
3,Frustrating,"Avent Isis Breast Pump with 2 Bottles Product is well made overall, but has a poor valve design that results in the valve losing suction and being pulled into the pump chamber. To replace or reset white valve you lose sterility and interrupt pumping - for me seems to happen at the worst time when the milk is flowing well. Having to start all over is a huge time waster and could be corrected by Avent with little modification ... seems to have been a recurring problem for some time. Other than white valve problem the product seems well designed ... my question to Philips Avent is ""Why have you not fixed this yet??? Recurring problem to others as well - do not ignore if your time is worth anything."
4,Cute,This is a cute movie... I don't have anything else to say but I still need just one more word... There.
3,3.5 Stars,"This is a very well written novel. It`s a tale of a young boys growth into manhood and his repeated experiences with loss and love and his constant need for revenge. This story takes you to many different places over the span of the characters life and over his hunting, that the story feels like it`s never going to get to a point. It gets a little frustrating a times. There were other points when it was very entertaining. If you like werewolf novels, it is worth a read, but you may have to be a little patient at times. I did enjoy the twist toward the end."
5,Great Book,"I often take my time when reading, but I literally could not put this book down. This author possesses a unique ability to paint a stunningly vivid portrayal of events that leaves you wanting more. The characters are also highly developed and compelling. This is a fantastic book and I wasted no time purchasing the second installment in the series."
3,It was ok,Story line good but just seemed to drag on and on and on.....Would have liked to have had more action.
4,Good read,"The story dragged at first, but was needed for character development. Once I started, I did not want to put it down."
1,Great Idea - lousy information,"This book could save your life if you ever needed to get a caribou or an antelope from a deaf indian. Or if you need to start a fire and have nothing but matches, a candle, kindling, and wood. Other than that, buy any other book.This book has a great layout - The windows and boxes with diagrams and short wording are much easier to read than paragraphs (yeah, I'm a magazine reader, not a novel reader). But the information is mostly useless and some is utter nonsense. Some of the others who said it would be a good kid's toy were right. This author would do well to bring his format to someone who knows what should be in a book like this."
1,Fell Short,"This one really fell short. It focuses way to much on things like surviving in the artic and not nearly enough on the more important things like shelter, fire, and trapping. You'd probably starve or freeze to death if you relied on this book for survival, unless you used it as tinder or threw it at an animal cuz it is thick and heavy."
3,Other Options Available,"I was very happy when I first found this product, as it appeared to be the only option of its kind. However, the dimensions did not seem quite right and I was put off by the $16-17 shipping charges. I found an alternative at babyfactory2u.com. They have 5 slightly different sizes of portable crib mattresses for $26.50 INCLUDING shipping."
3,IN RESPONSE TO: Can't find what I'm looking for!,"This is in response to the person opening a day care and looking for mattress for the porta cribs. I found a mattress store in Des Moine, IOWA called SLEEPLAND USA that will make a mattress in any size you want. I bought a mattress from them for my daughter's cradle and one for her porta crib. I love them, they are each 3"" thick, a lot thicker than other mattresses I found. It only takes them one day to custom make your mattress and they are also very reasonable in price."
4,A Good Read,"At first I did not know what to expect from this book because the cover seemed very amateurish, but I found it interesting. The author describes how he gathered data for San Diego real estate market, and tested whether there were any correlations between different variables. He came up with five Vital Signs that provide valuable clues for anticipating trends. They are:1. Existing home sales2. New home building permits3. Mortgage loan defaults4. Foreclosure sales5. Interest ratesThe author argues that investors can take these Vital Signs into any local real estate market and be able to make well-timed buy and sell decisions.- Mariusz Skonieczny, author of Why Are We So Clueless about the Stock Market? Learn how to invest your money, how to pick stocks, and how to make money in the stock market"
2,Looks nice before you wash it!,"I bought 3 of these changing pad covers and they have all done the same thing. As soon as you wash them they start to get long strings all over them! I have tried cutting them off, but as soon as you wash it again, you get more. Its really frustrating that they are made of such poor material."
3,"OK, but don't put them in the dryer","The best thing about these covers is the wide color selection. Other than that, they're just average. They can't go in the dryer because they will shrink badly. My mother-in-law tested my theory and put one in the dryer and it shriveled up like a prune. I have a drying rack in my laundry room and they always go on that. Also, the color fades after one or two washings. That's a little disappointing. I still recommend them, but just know what to expect and avoid the dryer! Also, try to purchase 3 covers because in those first months, you'll be changing them constantly -- especially if you have a boy -- ha ha."
2,Too linty...,We washed this and there was lint everywhere. Hopefully it will be better after the second washing but I'm not holding out much hope.
1,Bad Shrinkage? Or are there different sizes?,I bought two of these covers-washed them and now they do not fit on the changing pad. I do not remember having a choice of sizing on the changing pad or the covers. I am going to bring it back to the store and see if they will take them back. Disappointed!
1,Too small!!,"My baby isn't even here yet and I'm totally disappointed by these changing pad covers. You'd think they'd make them bigger, since everyone has the same response. The problem is I can't seem to find any other company that makes them except Simmons. :("
1,Way too small!,"I have two of these covers for my changing table. After just one washing the cover was slightly smaller, now that my son is 2 months old it has been washed numerous times and it is way too small.Little boys make messes, I can say it never stained, but now it won't fit the changing pad at all. After 2 months of use this is worthless and I am throwing them away."
1,1 out of 15 ain't bad,"Dejala is a great song, but the rest of the album is really bad. It looks like they make a fusion of every music style available just to get a single."
1,Sucks!,It gets cold really quick. After about a minute it would get too cold and it would stop spraying. I had to use 3 bottles and alternate between them because they went cold too quick.
4,"Product is good, packaging was horrible.","The actual product works fine, the only trouble is the fragile plastic tops on the cans.Since mine were improperly packed, they rattled around until one of the tops broke off, apparently filling the box and delivery truck with difluoroethane. Pretty irresponsible if you ask me.Because of this, I only got 5 cans, since the 6th was completely empty."
5,Air Power Dusters Quantity: 6 per Pack,"This product works well. This is a second order, and both were perfect, We will continue to use these as long as they are available. Works first try every time, and no objectional odor cloud. I lost most of the first order, due to sticky fingers, everyone knows I get what works, and they got theirs, before I could hide my stash. I'll put these in my closet before work. You better get some, before I get the rest."
1,Tough Read,"In 'Culture and Imperialism', Said describes Western Imperialism of the late 19th century through the literature of the time. Although I find this premise rather intriguing, the book left a lot to be desired for me, especially because Said's writing style is so complicated, that it makes the Internal Revenue Code appear as a leisurly read."
3,Love the DVD but.....,It froze up at the end of the 1st movie so the jury is still out! Hope I don't have to send it back!
5,You can expect excellent results,"Purchased 2, then installed into rev.1 G3 B/W macs. Amazing these machines run so well being almost 10 years old. Camera, Scanner and Printer response is in seconds not moments. A must have item for your older Mac. I couldn't be happier with Sonnett or Amazon."
1,Ginsey Toilet Seat,"As beautiful as it was, we were unable to get the toilet seat to screw on. We went to Lowe,s to try to get screws to fit the bolt of seat. We called the mfg. who sent us a part to tighten the bolt, which didn,t work either.We called Brown's Linens and we are returning both toilet seats. We are very unhappy we have to return these seats.Brown's & Linens were nice enough to take them back."
1,item is a fake,"mine is blown after just 6 weeks I believe it to be a fake after looking at the logo on the speaker its not the patented logo from jl audio Im contesting charges and getting my money back its a FAKE I google mapd the location it comes back to B.N.B INT'L TEXTILES INCADDRESS2620 S HILL STLOS ANGELES, CA 9007LOOK FOR YOURSELF STREET VIEW GOOGLEMAPSDiscount Central Online is seller"
5,DMA is the best series I have!,"I'm a DJ in Atlanta, and the DMA series CDs are by far my best CDs. I have backup copies just in case anything happens to them! 1-3 are all AWESOME, but the 4th one lacks the ""euro-techno"" style of the first three! Definatly a MUST BUY!"
1,Worst pan ever,"I got excited when I received the pan but to my horror I washed the pan and immediately found some brown rusty liquid. At first I thought it was dirty but the brown patches starts to appear on the whole surface when i left it to dry, even bottom of the pan and I have to chuck the whole thing away."
1,Do not recommend,It's a small pan. The handle gets very hot. When it gets wet rust starts building. Recommend to pay a bit more $$ and get a good experience making ebelskiver.
2,Was too small to fit on my stove even!,"This pan is Small.I have a gas range with heavy grates, and this pan was hard to get it to fit even, it kept falling through the grates till I could just get it right!(took some time)It came with a very good recipe, but to me this was such a pain in the neck to make these, I just took out my big double Calphalon Griddle and made pancakes, which turned out great, and tasted the same as AebleskiversWhen I did make Aebleskivers and put the jam in the middle , it seemed to disapeared and I had a hole where the jam was!! I then used fresh apples, that worked out better, but I still like pancakes, allot easier to make."
4,Better than a pack and play,"We bought this crib for our daughter to use for our frequent trips to my sister's house. Not one of my three children would sleep in a pack and play -- and it's no wonder with the tiny piece of foam covering a hard board as a mattress. This crib was comparably priced, folds up pretty easily (just has a different orientation than a pack and play), and has a much more comfortable sleeping surface. It feels sturdy and safe. Only thing I would recommend is to make or buy mini-bumpers, even for an older baby. They press their little heads against the metal (ouch)."
2,Not for me,"I was hoping this would be stiffer than most face brushes, which are way too soft to do anything other than push soap around your face. The description of this being able to exfoliate and prevent ingrown hairs on men is misleading - maybe if the bristles were more firm. Nope. Going back."
3,"Good Enough. But Could be better, Casio!","Watch is good and weighs comfortable on the wrist. I have always like a watch which does more than one thing. Who looks at their wrist watch to tell the time theses days? Multi-function is my thing! This watch does that to some extent.The cons to me are the cheap wrist band and the very hard-to-see digital units on the dial. The light shows only for a split second. I seriously belief that for the price, at least the physical appearance could have been improved a little; make the strap and housing more glossy, the digits on the dial more visible, etc.One major problem I am still having is how to set the UTC time differential to the pacific time zone (-08:0)because the options are in multiples of 5.I recommend it if you can't get any others."
5,And the light went on.,I found this book extremely helpful. After participating in the Markets for many many years little did I ever know of all the circumstances and situations that drive it.
1,waste of money to buy this book,"The book was very poorly conceived and with hiden agenda (propaganda for W. Oneill?). Rather than a book which details legendary trader's thoughts and analyses, from which readers could draw some lessions, the book is littered with historical waterlog, nothing else.Can't understand why the publisher would allow a book of this quality to be published in the first place."
1,Waste of Time,"History will often repeat itself but not always in the same form. This book has a good incentive since it tries to teach readers to learn from the history so we can better apply to the future, but then it deviates from its initial purpose by burying the reader in a pile of technical analysis nomencalaure. After reading a few chapters, all I remembered was in such a such a year, the market was up first and then down a little bit and then down more and then hit the bottom and then show signs of returning and then down again etc etc. etc. After reading the book, I walked away still with the question in my head, for all these years, did these traders just hit the jackpot by luck or did they really have a successful strategy that we can learn to use to apply to the future?"
2,42 lumens is WEAK,"Maybe a few years ago this was a good idea.42 lumens is the LED manufacturer's spec for a 1-watt LED. This flashlight probably doesn't even put out 42 lumens, they are just pasting in the LED specification (which doesn't account for light loss due to reflectors, etc.). In reality, this is probably about 30 lumens.If you really need a good flashlight for ""professional"" use, pay more for a Surefire G2. It's twice as bright, and they publish accurate light output numbers based on end-product testing.If you just want a flashlight for occasional use and don't need anything brighter, there are currently a lot of other 1-watt flashlights which run off of 1 or 2 AA batteries. Lithium batteries are great when power consumption needs them, but this isn't the kind of light that needs it."
5,awsome light,"this was an awsome buy and deal, this is the best deal to buy this same light anywhere else it is twice the price. i have it straped to my firefighter helmet and have used it alot and it is great."
3,Scorpion LED Review,"I like the light, but there was a problem with the rubber sleeve. After having the light for just over a week and only using it a couple of times, I noticed the sleeve was starting to peel. As much as I was disappointed, I was very pleased at the reply I received when I contacted Streamlight about the problem. They asked me for my mailing address and said they would be sending me a new sleeve. In my opinion, this is why we should only deal with well known companies."
3,Nothing revolutionary,"I buy tons of fps games. This one is a little different in that it really includes you as part of the game - more of a plot than most. Graphics are fast, but the world is a little screwy somtimes - not much freedom as it directs you exactly where you're supposed to go, and sometimes there are really annoying flaws - like when you crouch go prone behind a rock, it puts the camera view inside the rock - you can see under the enemies feet, and when you shoot tour rounds don't hit anything. Also - when moving around in prone position and you go to crawl over a rock or something, the camera will get pointed at the sky or something and won't allow you to keep focused in the direction you're trying to see. Pretty hoaky. Needs a patch or two. The sound is cool though."
3,"Somewhat good, and Somewhat bad...","This game is unique in its on way. I did have fun playing it, and yes you full as if your there in the woods and jungles of vietnam. There are a few bugs here and there, but not enough to make you just want to stop playing it. If your in to fps shooters and like vietnam games this is an ok game to own for your PC gaming collection."
1,STAY AWAY!!!!,"What a horrible piece of ....!It worked well the first oh.... 45 minutes, then as stated in the other reviews my tape player kept reversing every song or so & would then just eject the tape. Evidently from what I've learned this isn't an uncommon problem with this unit.I did like the fact that it has a car charger, great for road trips & if you spend lots of time in driving like I do. Also I liked the fact that the wires are retractable, unfortionately the pros don't mean anything if it won't stay in the tape deck!I've read several other reviews of these & am sorry I didn't purchase the Sony version which I'm going to have to buy now anyway.My advice is if your going with a tape model, stay away from this one & get the Sony."
5,Takes the pretentiousness out of Opera!,"My mother is a singer, and I fought against Opera, Classical Music, etc. through my childhood and teen years. I never took the time to understand it. As an Audiobook addict, I picked this up and absolutely loved it. The authors are quite funny and teach you to think of Opera as entertainment. It goes through Opera's history, how it is perceived in other lands, do's and dont's of opera, and helps you understand how to get the most out of it. It really makes you want to see one! In fact, I ran to the library and checked out Don Giovanni! This audio book gives you the tools to begin exploring Opera for your own benefit...and will be a big plus in case you are ever a Millionaire or Jeopardy contestant!"
4,"Not much too it, but what is there is good.","You will be able to read this book in an hour or less. There are only about 100 pages with lots of photos. What's in the book is good, but like another reviewer said I would have liked for the book to be more in depth. The material in the book was good and offered some ideas on how to build your speed and power, and explains how important being fit is to defending yourself."
5,BEST CHOICE FOR PLAY RESEARCH,"As the mom of Lili and Eva, I am most interested in developmental research on toys and the value of play. I bought this book as a ""bundle"" with another similar title and I have to say that I could hardly put it down.My favorite chapter is about Smart Shopping and it made shopping on the internet for toys much more understandable. I would suggest this book for any parent who wants to learn about the values that toys play in a child's life. Also, the font of the book is easy to read and the toy quiz is fun to take."
3,Just OK,"Had never heard of the Cramps until a ""Fresh Air"" interview of a band on NPR, who said they were influenced by The Cramps. I'm a fan of rockabilly, especially The Stray Cats, but have to say, without tyring to offend the Cramp faithful, this band is not my cup of tea.Did enjoy the follwing songs:GarbagemanThe Way I WalkDominoHowever, I found it hard to listen to the whole CD, it starts out pretty good, but started to wear on my around the halfway mark."
4,Very Cute!!!,"I got this mobile as a gift a couple weeks ago, and although my son isn't here yet I think he'll love this mobile. One thing that most parents forget when choosing a mobile is to look at it from where their baby will be; laying in the crib. Most parents select a mobile that looks cute to them, and most of the time the baby sees nothing but the bottoms of the stuffed toys. This mobile is for baby, the bears all face down towards the baby and not out for the parents. The bears are all so cute. The music box does play a little fast, but I still think it is a great mobile. I will cut the bears off when my son is too old to have a mobile in his crib, and I'm sure he'll enjoy playing with them."
4,Nioka Bride of Bigfoot,"A fun book --if you know Seattle are you can relate to this book. If you are a green, lean, and save the earth, kind of person, a must to read....Paul Doyle Brings nature to life."
2,Print jams and internal errors make this a bad buy,"I love the functionality - a scanner and a printer in one with a low profile.However, incessant printer jams make the blood pressure rise with this printer.1 out of 5 print runs (I usually print 5-10 pages at a time) works successfully, otherwise one needs stand over it to baby out pages that have been jammed (and when it does jam, it loses count of pages, destroys three and you have to piece a printing back together). Printing a longer piece - say 300 pages - is a complete nightmare and could possibly consume your day.Also - the scan quality is really terrible - it puts lines through the scans.My recommendation? Look elsewhere.I had a Lexmark Optra 310 for 10 years and it was a beautiful workhorse of a printer and I hoped the same for this one. Alas, no."
4,Good printer,"As a laser printer with added capability this fits my needs well. The print is excellent, copy mode is good. Somewhat awkward to select zoom features in the copy mode. Absolutely silent in sleep mode -- comes to life quickly. For the price (<$150), really hard to beat."
2,Class Book,I used this book here at UNC Charlotte for our Western History and Culture class. It isn't a very good book for actually learning the religions because it is very broad. But when the class only lasts a semester it is fine for hitting all the main points. I still dont like the class though.
5,One of the Most Beautiful Knitting Books,"I love Alice Starmore's books. This one is no exceptiion. It is filled with absolutely beautiful photographs of places, stitches, and projects. It is a shame Alice Starmore Yarns is no longer made but I have had luck substituting Jamieson, Simply Shetland and Rowan yarns.This book is filled with projects that I would love to make if there were more hours in the day. Most of the projects are for intermediate to experienced knitters but if you are a beginner and would like inspiration and beautiful eye candy, check out this book.Most of the patterns are for adult projects but there is a child's sweater and a lovely shawl. I would give this book ten stars if I could!"
2,Unusable,"Unfortunately, I could not use this item. I thought it was Mac compatible, but it was not. Somehow, it ended up in my search for Mac software - either by my fault or the systems. Anyway, it was unusable to me and had to be returned."
4,A Very Good Greeting Card Program,"My wife previously used Create-A-Card greeting card software on a windows computer until they stopped making the program for installation on a computer. She then switched to the Hallmark program but found she could not use her saved Create-A-Card greeting cards with the Hallmark program. As soon as we loaded the Printmaster program onto our ""XP"" windows computer it automatically found and imported her old saved Create-A-Card greeting cardsPros: Easy to install, large selection of greeting cards, works with saved Create-A-Card greeting cards, many other features besides greeting cardsCons: Graphics not as good as those in the Hallmark program"
2,Printmaster Platinum V17.0,Not pleased with this product.Cannot e mail finished product because receivers see the card as a virus and won't allow to open.Very limited in selections.difficulty in inserting printed messages into designated spaces.Very primative package.Would not order or recommend.
3,A little hand-wavy,"Overall, I thought the book was interesting and somewhat thought provoking. However, it didn't seem very concrete. I was actually more interested in the author's website, which was supposed to have links to new information and sources.That website appears to still be there, but it redirects you almost immediately to the Amazon page for the book. You get a glimpse of the page and then it's gone.I've got the book. I don't need another copy. I could use newer (and more specific) information."
4,Lovely but incomplete,I really like this saute pan but mine was shipped without the described stainless steel steaming/draining rack. Amazon was great and efficiently sent me a replacement pan - which unfortunately was also missing the rack. Has anyone else experienced this? It is a pity as I really really like the pan.
2,Meh,I couldnt get this working properly so I gave up. Not the best or easiest item to work with at all.
1,Why would anybody buy this?,"As of 7/11/07 this bundle is 250 dollars. That's insane! I'm sure you can still find this DS around somewhere at a store and it would be 120 or 130 dollars. If you want Animal Crossing, then that's an extra 30 bucks. All of this will have tax but since you'd be buying these SEPARATELY, it will cost you way less than this bundle.Take a look!We're gonna assume that the electric blue DS is 130 dollars. Animal Crossing is 30 dollars.Nintendo DS:130+ 30----160 plus tax. I dunno where you live but in NY the tax is 8%.130 x 0.08= 10.40Animal Crossing:30 x 0.08= 2.40160+ 12.80-------172.80You see! It only comes out to be less than 180 dollars. Even if the electric blue DS (which I own) is rare these days, you could always just settle for the DS Lite. No biggie, right? It's also got better lighting.Anyway, if this helped anyone, I've done my job!"
1,worst digital camera I've ever used,"The flash is required to be used on every picture, or else the tiniest hint of hand movement (no matter how steady you hold your hand) will blur the picture. I don't know why the flash should make a difference in that regard, but it's consistent. Your preferences are reset every time you turn off the camera, so you need to re-select picture size, etc. I'd have to say this is the worst camera I've ever used. Even the one I had back in 1997, with the comport connection, was better than this."
5,Annapurna,"What an adventure story this is. One of the best mountain climbing books around. Maurice Herzog became a mountaineer because the mountains were there and so was he. Annapurna, an 8,000 meter peak was climbed three years prior to Sir Edmund Hillary's conquest of Everest. A must have for every climber's library."
1,I would sleep 12 hours too,"If some who I thought cared about me neglected and starved me in this way I would sleep 12 also. Why? Because depression makes a person sleep more. What is the point of being awake if you are nothing more than an incovenuence and your basic needs are low priority?Honestly, if 12 hours sleep is more important then you can save yourself the hassle by getting your tubes tied."
3,"Sounds good, but not for us yet","The four rules she gives sound easy enough, but we couldn't even get past the first one. There is no way our baby will go 4 hours between feedings, if I try to give him more he either pushes it away or eats it all and then spits up a bunch of it! He is also miserable between feedings if I try to go that long. Maybe I'll give it another try in a few months, but not now. Also, this book pretty much dismisses co-sleeping (which we are doing now), just an FYI if you're a co-sleeper."
5,MUST HAVE BOOK,I was recommended this book from a friend. I already had a toddler but could not figure out my daughters sleeping habits and had to get her to sleep better as it was almost 5 months. All I did was follow the first half of the book and TA DA we had a sleeper! This book is SUPER easy to read through in about 2 hours and so helpful and easy. Just by feeding our daughter more ounces per bottle and making her wait 4 hrs between each feeding did the trick. Whatever you get out of this book it will be something wonderful!
5,Short read and effective technique,"We used this for both of your children, who are now three and five years old. It has some very useful tips. Our older child was mostly bottle fed, and the techniques in the book worked great. Things were a little more challenging for our younger child, who was not bottle fed until he was much older than twelve weeks. Still a great book."
1,Ouch. One size doesn't fit any!,"I heard about this book from friends and while I wasn't big on the idea, I thought I might at least find a few nuggets of good information. Instead I found a book written by someone with little knoweledge of how often a baby needs to nurse during the day and night in order to thrive. She apparently thinks a 10 week old baby should be able to wait as long as an adult to ""eat"" even though the baby has a stomach as tiny as their fist. I found the information in this book to be alarming."
1,Not worth the paper on which it's printed,This book is terrifying and patently dangerous. Please find something more humane.
5,Colored Norpro Spoon,"Very pretty! This will be great for buffets to serve rice, couscous or corn. Sturdy, long handle, beautifully polished and definitely a conversation piece."
4,not a fantasy lover,"I'm not a big fantasy person- in fact, i try to avoid it like the plague. However, this book was great, and kept me very very interested!"
4,A marvelous book indeed,"Alas, finally a 4th age fantasy novel. The deed of Paksenarrion is a must for any fantasy fan out there. Elisabeth moon describes military life with such audacity that you almost believe you're there yourself. The tale of a sheepfarmers daughter that runs away from home to become a mercenary and a paladin at the end is an inspiring story with many twists and turns.I've only given it four stars, as it fails to surprise me most of the time. All in all it's a good book, well written and good background research, a well worth read for most of us."
2,High Hopes Dashed.,"Try as I might, and as much as I wanted to like this book, I couldn't stick with it. Great premise, promising approach, but bland execution.I finally had invested so much time that I felt compelled to skip closer to the ending, which was more or less satisfying, but it was too hard to get there.Are her other books easier to get through?"
3,a good deed,"this is a story that can conceive. the quest isn't obvious, in fact it is hidden. it is a story about a girl deciding to join an army. M is great at describing a soldier's life (not boring, relax, plenty of intrigue and battles) in details. the girl'a ambitions drives her forth. bur perhaps her mission should be something else?"
5,One of the Best Ever,"READ THESE BOOKS!!!!!!! When I first began reading them I thought, ""I'm sick of these macho women books."" But, the story of Paks turning from a raw recruit into a Paladin of God is winning and engrossing. You won't regret putting the time into reading these stories. No one should miss them."
5,An absolutely wonderful read. Couldn't put it down!,"Having now read this book at least 3-4 times, I can clearly say that I enjoy it more each successive time I read it.Ms. Moon has created in Paksenarrion, a charactor who is completely believable, full of wonder and fears we can allcertainly relate to. She develops both persona, relationships and environs to a degree few authors evertruly master, engaging the reader fully in the story. She has a gift for mixing rational reality with myth and fantasywhich I found most entertaining, while rarely having to suspend my ability to disbelieve.I definitely recommend the 3 volume book. It travels better, is in a large bound format, and you don't have to worry about juggling three books, or about having forgotten the next one when you finish the last volume. You certainly won't want to stop reading."
5,One of the Finest books in the Genre,"Ms. Moon has an excellent background in the Military and in matters ecumenical, these combine nicely in this tale of a sheepfarmer's daughter on the long and painful journey of spiritual perfection.The tale is aventurous, exciting, thought-provoking and thoroughly enjoyable. You will laugh, cry and cheer..."
4,A great read...,"Beautiful description, in a not-so-standard fantasy setting. Wish more books could be like this one."
3,Funai FDRV90E Dual-Deck DVD/VHS Player/Recorder,The machine works well - while the remote control is difficult to read - to long and to many buttons...
2,Lanzar vibe286,"This product is a fake, all the power SPEC that show on the internet or the box itself is not true, check the manual product online and you will see it for yourself, It is less than half of what the internet or the box product show. So if you want a weak amp this is the one you need, I am talking(( really weak and low output ))"
2,"This amp is junk, don't buy it. Blew after 3 months.","It bumped pretty good for the 3 months it worked, but usually went into protect briefly after about 45-60 minutes. I was pushing a pair of lanzar 10's @2ohms from overstock.com in a custom bandpass box. I set gain with a DMM.My amp blew a fuse yesterday, I thought 'no big deal, easy fix.' The amp does not power up at all, no power light, no anything. Voltage good at fuses & remote switch; wtf!? Internal power supply transistor, or something... I don't know.I was disappointed when I first got it, too. The box clearly claims 2x1650 @2ohm or 2x1000 @4ohm, BUT THIS IS AN OUTRIGHT LIE. The manual shows the rms ratings for vibe286 are actually 2x450 @2ohm and 2x300 @4ohm.Complete waste of money, I strongly discourage buying this. There are much better amps available for <$200."
1,Pure garbage,"Poorly formatted, uninteresting photos for the most part, too little of information that could be easily looked up on any search engine, a definite rip-off in every sense of the word."
4,"Slick, thought-provoking.","Stylish, effective writing style, with plenty of futurism predictions that one expects from sci-fi. Although, with the brain-cloned-body back up technology; it occurs to me that as much as robotic sex-bots would put prostitutes out of business, the brain backup technology would render assassinations obsolete. Anyone important enough to be worth assassinating will be able to clone themselves and replace all their knowledge in a new body. What's the point? Why even bother? Otherwise, it's pleasant to read and exciting."
2,novel idea...but...,"It's a generally ok, the format of the whole thing needs to be changed, it's no user friendly at all...sort of has an old pc kind of feel to it...honestly would recommend waiting for this type of product for something better to come along. The seller is awesome, very speedy delivery."
4,Great 80s sound!,If you love the sound of 80s music then you should buy this CD! Gene Miller who is the lead vocalist has an amazing voice not to be ignored! He can also be heard on The Civil War: Our Story in Song (both the Nashville Sessions CD and the Complete Works double CD set).
2,The Title is Inaccurate,"I turned to this book while preparing to lead a reading group on Fitzgerald's The Blue Flower--thus I've read only Wolfe's chapter on that book. I was not impressed! Wolfe does a decent job of flagging significant passages in the novel itself, but doesn't exert himself much beyond that--which is a shame, because to really understand The Blue Flower, it helps to know more about its subject, the poet Novalis, than Fitzgerald gives away. Wolfe's method seems to have been to read the novel and write down his first impressions, including any associations with other works that floated to the top of his mind. I'm very glad I read this book in a library; if I'd bought it, I would feel very cheated."
2,I don't recommend this book,"Lot's of sassy, slap-stick humor presented in a choppy and slang writing style. No great plot, characters average."
1,The most basic of maps,If you have no map of Nayarit (the state of Mexico just to the north of Puerto Vallarta) then this is better than nothing. It has a major highway on it (from the south of Tepic) that is completely in the wrong location. Also there is no city detail for Tepic or any of the towns in the state.At the present other than car rental company maps I know of no other state map of Nayarit.
1,No Secrets Here,"I was very disappointed by this book. Before buying it I listened to teleseminars and even did some preliminary research on this topic. The reason I got it was so I could have one reference guide. If I just spent an hour online I could have collected more relevant information. In addition, half the book is about how to start a business painting street address numbers on curbs. That's totally outside of my area of interest. If I had to buy it again, I would not."
3,"Some good ideas, but now there are better","TQM was a great idea in its time. Now one can see that TQM, like what came before and after it like Excellence and Six Sigma, is just a subset of what really works- Open-Book Management (see the book of the same name by John Case). When TQM, or any similar program, is implemented, in order for it to work, needs to address the other areas of OBM such as financial information and understanding, appropriate responsibilities, and a stake in the rewards.Fortunately, not only does this book/tape talk about TQM in particular, but it also talks about certain issues involved in implementing any similar type of program."
5,Fabulous Thermometer,"I recently ordered three of these, one for home, one for my vacation home, and one for work. They are absolutely fabulous. The static cling is great, even in the highest winds they don't blow off. The only thing is, you really must keep them out of the direct sunlight because if they are not, the readings get ridiculously high. The print is large enough to read clearly, and they are very accurate."
4,Chromosomal Abnormalities and Genetic Counseling,"A good book, I reviewed it in the context of a pathology resident. I used it in conjunction with the Cytogenetics chapter in Henry's.Some parts were fairly difficult to grasp, such as the numerous literature references with in vitro fertilization studies. The book is pretty well written, even if you only have a basic understanding of cytogenetics as I did. I thought the chromosomal breakage syndrome chapter was good, with good photos. Overall, worth the money and the book is fairly high quality, durable pages that facilitates note taking in the margins."
3,"Cool character, statue","I bought this toy many years ago and lost it when I moved. I missed it so I bought it again, it's pretty cool. It's better as a statue then a toy though, the arms cannot be moved very well and it's not exactly the best to play with. But it looks cool, and thats why I got it."
3,"Does not have the standard ""a"" !!!","I would give this product 5 stars, but it does not have the standard lowercase ""a"", as noted in the picture on Amazon.com. It has the other lowercase ""a"". . .the one also used in this typeface (I don't know the technical name)! I will still be able to use the other words. . .but it was definitely false advertising!"
2,"Simple, too simple","If your looking for something beyond gradeschool math (read:algebra/geometry)then I wouldn't recommend this book. The formulas would be usefull in modifying from an already set or measured value (tire size,mph,mpg) but would not be usefull when trying to design, analyze or mathmaticaly model anything. Use of English units nice for laymen.I was dissapointed at the lack of truely usefull equations, most seem to be shuffling of equations.Conversion tables are nice however."
3,Valley 0-200 PSI guage,The picture clearly shows 0-100 PSI. I have used this brand with no problems. I just wish the descriptions matched the pictures of the products.
3,Pretty much as expected.,"I wasn't expecting too much out of this---I bought this cage for vet visits/short trips and it will work for these purposes. If I hadn't gotten it for such a low price and actually planned to use it on a regular basis, however, I would be pretty aggravated. I'm going to have to zip tie the corners because the gape way too much to be secure. The door, as well, is going to have to be somehow rigged so that the rats don't escape between the gaps. Eh. It's small and not that well made, but it was cheap. Buy it if you need something temporary, but don't order this as a permanent home and think that you or your rats will be happy.Also, weird thing: the ledge is blue, but the base is the same purple as shown in the photo. It looks pretty goofy."
5,Right On,"Herman Lehmann was a name mentioned a few times within my family as a boy growing up. Others were Korn, Fisher, etc. I was born in Texas. My Mother was Choctaw, born 1902, my father,1895, a descendent from hard core Texans that fought with Sam Houston. My Mother's people were moved from Mississippi to Oklahome where some reside today. I have read many stories concerning the lives of various tribes but I think Herman hits the nail on the head when it comes to the Apachie and Comanchie, however he does not speak for them all.In the seventies,I lived as a missionary among the Navaho and others. I found that each tribe place their values of life somewhat different.Herman's life is interesting and educational. Several college professors have used his documented eventful life as source.A good book, buy it!"
5,Important historical testimony,"This book is a good antidote to the familiar modern view of all American Indians as proto-flower-children. The fact is that some tribes were not at all nice and, in fact, worked hard at deserving the term ""savages."" Unfortunately, the public is not encouraged to distinguish among tribes and cultures. There is gross irony in modern liberals and pacifists championing an idealized memory of thorough-going warrior cultures, in which the principal measure of one's stature was how many scalps hung from one's accoutrements."
4,I almost quit on this one... you shouldn't,"The beginning of this book was slow, painfully so at times. The verbosity of the author makes it hard to get into the story. Then, as the story begins to move in and out of the email converstations things pick up and I couldn't put the book down. At that point I realized (or at least speculated) that the writing style was meant to set a tone for the story. As the book switches characters, the writing style changes subtly. In the end, I was happy I read the book and would recommend it to you.I for one did not find the mention of ""alternative lifestyles"" distracting or offensive. I did, however, find the ""plugs"" for Dodie Smith strange and out of place."
4,How I would review Fidelity:What it Means to be a One-Woman,"The book is right on, but rather discriptive. Not for children, but an excellent resource book for men."
5,Intermediate Algebra,"This book is very very useful. The writers Miller, O'Neil, and Hyde are the right people that created this book. If you follow their explanations, you will succeed 100%, trust me. Whenever I had problems, I looked their explanations which helped me a lot on my exams. These three Lady's deserve all credits in the World because everything they say is 100% true. God bless, and thank you very much."
4,Excellent CD that grows on you,As a Selena fan I was eager to see how Jennifer had turned out. She has a beautiful voice. The 2 CD's are a bargain contianing both a mixture of slow and rythmic tunes. A definite must have for anyone interested in the latin genre of music.
3,Kansas 1988 Album On MCA Label.,"Up to this point I had owned the Kansas albums Leftoverture, Point Of No Return and Vinyl Confessions, plus a 1 disc compilation.I had never heard of In The Spirit Of Things and now having listerned to it, I find that the further down the track list I went, the better it got.Rainmaker is a striking song, T.O. Witcher is an all too short acoustic guitar instrumental and Bells Of Saint James is a sad song of lost love.I don't see this in the same bracket as the above albums, maybe it misses the violin and Kerry Livgren input, however it's still Kansas!"
4,Outstanding Performance with Conceptual Flaws,"Kansas paints a grim, albeit poignant picture of the American Midwestern small town in In the Spirit of Things. Taking the history of a true Kansas ghost town and recreating its mood through song in its waning days, this album would've raised eyebrows and critical acclaim had it been done a few years earlier. And, in reality, the entire concept may have been too deep for this album. Nonetheless, there are some stand-out tracks, including Ghosts, Stand Beside Me, The Bells of St. James, and I Counted on You. Steve Walsh's voice was never better, and Steve Morse, as usual, shines throughout, although his guitar work is a bit too restrained. For Kansas fans, this is a must album where they return to their roots in an affectionate homage to one of the many little Kansas towns where they first played as a band thirty years ago. It is perhaps their best album from the 1980's."
3,The Best and Worst of Kansas,"This album would have been better had songs like 'One Man', and 'Inside of Me', been left off. I thought this CD had some of their best songs, 'Ghosts', 'Rainmaker', and 'Preacherman'. There was just a little too much of an outside writing influence with the songs listed previously, that it is not rated higher in my mind. Would have liked more of the Walsh, Morse songs. All in all, a very good album."
5,1961 Fashion Wedding Doll Reproduction...a real Doll,"The seller DALCARD packed this doll very carefully and nicely, and even marked the box 'FRAGILE', so she arrived in perfect condition. She is so beautiful, and looks EXACTLY as pictured. She will be given as a Christmas present to my daughter, who is collecting Barbie Dolls now. Her dress and veil are lovely. And this Barbie looks (almost) exactly as the 1961 doll....I couldn't tell the difference. Love her. Very pleased with purchase and with seller, and of course, Amazon. Thank you."
3,only a few arias,"Callas only sings 4 arias on this dvd. This is the reason I gave only 3 stars. But sung of the finest possible voice, better than on other dvds availlable. The rest of it is Tosca complete act 2 and other orchestral pieces. She sings ""Vissi d'arte"", ""Tu che le vanita"" superbly, ""Habanera"" from Carmen and ""Seguedille"" of the same."
4,A Description.....,"From Back Cover:Edwina Crusoe, top-notch nurse and super-sleuth, is called back to Chelsea Memorial when patients who survive routine operations start ending up in the morgue. With rumors flying of a ""death angel"" on staff, nervous hospital administrators know Edwina's the only one who can get to the bottom of it all.As savvy a snoop as she is a nurse, she quickly uncovers a twisted trail of deceit and deadly motives. But when the danterous case lands her where she's most vulnerable - flat on her back in Chelsea Memorial - Edwina finds herself at the mercy of a killer on the loose. Now, she must be doubly careful - because the smallest mistake carries a stiff penalty..."
2,Lists only one female thinker?,"The entire book lists only one female thinker, Rabia. I realize that the traditions discussed do tend to be sexist and not record most of their female thinkers, but the writer could have tried a little harder to find at least a few female thinkers to include."
4,"Great headphones, good noise cancelling...","These headphones sound great and the noise cancelling works well. If you are expecting headphones that will eliminate all the noise on a plane trip, for example, then these headphones will not do that. For that you really need the big, cushioned headphones that completely cover your ears. I like these because they cut the low drone of the plane's engines and ventilation system and reduce other cabin noises and let you clearly listen to the inflight movies or to music without completely cutting you off to what's going on around you."
4,Very good value,"I bought these headphones for my iPod during travel. Compared with the Bose noise cancelling headphones I found the sound of the Sennheisers more natural and less ""rich"" which might not be enough for others. They are lightweight and the comfort is OK although getting less comfortable after 2-3 hours. Sound reduction is good and really helpful when enjoying inflight entertainment (necessary adapters are included) or during bus or train travel. When looking at other products keep in mind that the Sennheisers work with standard AA batteries and that you can still listen to your music without batteries (without noise reduction of course)."
2,bland and so-what but trying very hard to be more,"Well... I don't usually write reviews, but for some reason this book makes me want to, and not because I liked it. I think there's so much hype in the media, and not enough real standards. I bought this book because of the Boston Globe review like another reader but didn't agree at all with the reviewer. I think her writing is really sort of boring, and the story didn't grab me at all even though I kept reading, waiting for the good parts the reviewer had assured me would be there. Oh well -- I'm wiser now. But -- as far as the story goes -- my feeling is basically, SO WHAT? I wasn't moved or involved, and kept noticing how she never gave any real physical detail or made her characters come to life. I want more from books, something more real. I don't recommend this one."
4,Good.....but too short,"This was my first Samurai X experience. I was very impressed with the deep story line and the top notch animation. However, the plot was rather predictable, the movie was too short, and too many flash backs (maybe to make the movie longer?). This would have received a 5 if it wasn't for those 3 things. Make no mistake, this movie was still BADASS...excuse the language :) I loved it, and I think all anime lovers should take a look. BTW...I just started to collect the TV series and watched all the DVDs up to Ice Blue Eyes. I am also eagerly waiting for Trust and Betrayal to come home"
3,Oh my,I like kenshin i really do but this movie just...upset me. I like the funny cracks and jokes but it just kept on with the flashbacks. Alot more gore...if I wanted to see that I would have watched the OVA version. I don't like the way it jumped around...sigh.
2,"Can you spell, ""B-A-D""?","This was an utterly ridiculous movie....First of all, the movie and the series are very different from one another. So much in fact, that the two have almost nothing in common. This story takes place a little after the second arc of the Rurouni Kenshin series. If you've seen the second arc then you know Kenshin has already conquered the manslayer within him, Saito is supposedly dead, and Sanosuke Seighara has mastered a punch called the Tio-fukenoki-wammi (however you spell that crap). In this movie, however, Kenshin allows the manslayer within to emerge, Saito reappears and Sanosuke has no knowledge of the tio-fukenoki-wammi (however you spell that crap).This storty, plainly putting it, makes no sense whatsoever. Do not get this movie. If you do, you will surely regret it."
2,Hmmm. What happened?,"Loved the 2 Originals (Trust/Betrayal) but this is a saturday morning cartoon compared to those two, OH well..."
4,Read the manual,"Simpletons,No product is perfect, this printer has problems, but what do you expect from a made in ""insert Asian country of choice here.""Please read the manual, use the HP support page, find a techie, and learn proper grammar.The HP support website is a fantastic resource.I've had this printer since 2005 and it works great."
1,Awful junk. Goodbye HP,"I can't say enough bad things about this unit. I have replaced it three times and every unit falls apart eventually.The design seems, well, evil. For example: I have long since given up using it as a printer. Instead I just use it to fax. A moment ago I wanted to fax something and when I turned it on the message ""remove and check color cartridge"" was flashing. There is no way to turn it off or bypass it. Removing the cartridge is useless and I am prohibited from faxing at all."
1,6210 = POC,"I, like many others, have the ""Carriage jam"" problem where the printer flags for a spurious error. I've cleaned it, cursed at it, pressed down on the front bezel, cursed at it,...you get the picture. If it prints, it's not bad, but GETTING it to print ....The faxing capability also doesn't work worth a darn. Whether this is a side effect of the carriage jam or just another ""thing"" , who knows. This is my third, and last, HP printer. Too much junk, made by offshored US jobs. I'm looking at an Epson 1400 instead.P.S. The price from the current vendor of $999 has to be a bad joke. The printer might, and I emphasize ""might"", be a steal at $29."
1,not worth it no matter the price,"never make a purchase on price alone my friends. i should have done my research and steered clear of this junker. it is painfully slow. it does not matter what you change your settings to or what function you are choosing. the copy function is remarkably the slowest and you best plan to take 20 minutes if you have more than five copies. it goes through ink quite rapidly. you also best use the more expensive hp ink cartridge. if you don't it will nag you with messages every time you use it and then give you an error until it is replaced with hp ""quality."" now i get the infamous scanner malfunction. it makes you do a hard reset and then will not work anyway. have not found a work around and hp is tech support hell. it is now useless. i am replacing it tomorrow, not with hp. google search this one before buying."
3,For Rock Hudson fans,"""Battle Hymn"" is roughly based on an actual event -- the rescue of a bunch of orphans during the Korean War, who were saved from the advancing North Koreans when they were packed into U.S. cargo planes and flown to safety.Rock Hudson is not given much of an opportunity to display his acting ability (of which he possessed more than he was given credit for during his lifetime), but he does a workmanlike job with the lines he's given. He portrays an actual U.S. Air Force officer who was in civilian life a clergyman. Hess was involved in the famous ""Kiddy Car Airlift"" -- although, according to detractors, possibly not to the extent shown in the movie.The story itself is rewarding and for die-hard Hudson fans who would be happy merely to watch him declaim the telephone book, it's probably worthwhile."
5,a little harder,this box of words were a little harder to use and this was my intention to stimulate the mind while making sentences.
2,Very poor product that easily could have been a good one,"This product is too cheaply made. Another dollar in material costs probably would have made it useful.The shoe pockets are far too small for most pairs of men's shoes (contrary to the included pictures). Net, if you have feet bigger than those of a small child, you will use one pocket per shoe, not per pair (I did not try it with women's shoes).Hanging hardware is also cheap but would be totally livable if the main thing worked."
4,Sturdy product,I wear 14D and my shoes strained this organizer. My wife's shoes fit perfectly and she is using this item and is satisfied.
4,Clones Comic Clones Movie...almost,"I realize that comic adapters have a lot of handicaps when doing comic books based on a movie that is not quite finished yet. And of course, the artists and writers do their best to catch the spirit, if not the letter, of a movie. This is hard to accomplish, yet Henry Gilroy and his crew manage to catch Episode II's spirit very well, if imperfectly. I subtracted one star for minor gripes here and there.....but otherwise, worth having in one's Star Wars library."
3,"A hard wired ""wireless router"" - DOWNGRADE: no stars","Had most of the problems you can read about here. With wireless (WAP security) turned on and little used I had to reboot the router monthly. With some long working wireless Saturdays it could lock up within a few hours. Only solution is power cycle; which at least doesn't reset the flash settings.So I quit using wireless, connected up a cable, and as a router and statefull firewall it's been pretty darn stable for more than a year - with only very occasional wireless use. Good enough to not replace, but not what I bought.Router died on 02 May 2009, with ethernet port to DSL modem non-responsive. Troubleshooting a pain because the router log only indicates timeouts for PPPoE PADO responses. Don't buy."
2,"Magnificent Tebaldi, stabbed in the back by recording techniques.","Having been a fan of La Tebaldi for many, many years, I looked forward to this CD and the very well known content. Little did I know that it was a collection of music very apparently recorded in studios equipped barely above the days of 78 RPM albums. To constrain a range like Tebaldi's within a frequency range better suited for a very average basso is to excise the very notes for which one listens. Even that which escaped the infringements of the recording range available, was muddied by the aforementioned stone age recording equipment, defeating the sweetness of her voice and rendering some of it better described as shrill.I found this entire recording an insult to a lady properly described as a diva for the ages. The two stars I offer are only for her voice, despite the injustice done it by this recording."
5,Reasons For You To Love Jay Bennett,"This album does exactly what Jay Bennett needed to do: prove the value of having such diversity in his musical abilities. Unlike Wilco's new experiments and Farrar's recent lullabies, Bennett doesn't busy himself trying so hard to be artsy. He rocks when he needs to, and uses unusual engineering and distortion techniques only when it really improves the song (Reasons for You to Love Me is the best produced song I've heard in... well, forever maybe). That said, the album does take a little work to get into at first; don't expect to just listen to the first three or four songs and expect it to slow down. It's got a ""whole album"" effect to it, rather than just having a couple fast, poppy songs surrounded by mediocrity. What's more, it was apparently worth it to break up Bennett's projects into a four album cycle... so I especially recommend this album in order to really get the whole experience from all that Jay has coming out over the next several months."
5,garbage disposal splash guard,You cannot beat this for the money...the least expensive one GE had was $6. This one works just fine....i will probably get another one for a backup
3,"Great vacuum, except for the brushes","The brushes on the spinning roller are coming off (not just a few either) and I've only had it a month.I quite like the vacuum for its handling, width, cleaning, etc.Probably wouldn't buy another of this model.Go for a Royal classic with the aluminum housing."
2,Less than Desirable,"There is no way to stop the roller brush on this vacuum so it can not be used on floors, carpet only. It does a good job on carpet but no adjustment for roller height control and after only a couple of uses the roller drive belt came off and is a pain to put back on."
5,"A very good intro, but with a lot of rambling","It is a very good book if you want to learn about Archaeology, but not if you want information about the subject. It is a VERY quick overview. Nothing radical or extreme, and very objective."
1,Not water resistant,"I purchased this meter from another seller who claimed it was water resistant. First time I hosed down the boat it developed condensation inside and stoped working. When it worked it made this loud TAK TAK TAK sound that was very anoying. $15.00 ""down the drain"" literally!"
4,Informs while entertaining,"there are two types of books - those that entertain and those that inform. This book manages to bridge the gap. It's a fast read and a fun one, and you actually learn somerthing along the way. I leanred more about the history and dynamic of this place called Denison than I ever thought I would.It's amazong just how interesting ""off the beaten path"" can be."
1,Don't swim with it!,"This item is NOT waterproof. It failed 20 minutes into my first time in the pool. It was properly closed and sealed (you fully tighten 1 screw to accomplish this). I was swimming laps and the player was never more than 2/3 meter below the surface (though it was fully immersed for that 20 minutes). It quit playing and when I examined it I could see moisture behind the glass on the interface screen. Even after opening drying it for a week, it never recovered. I returned it and received a full refund. This player may work for activities where water immersion is short and intermittent, but if you're looking to lap swim, best try a different ""waterproof"" player."
3,Good covers but....,"They could have chosen better songs to cover. I think by this being their third album the luster has worn off. they should pick crowd favorites instead of some of these songs. i think there is about 5 really good covers and 2 decent ones and about 5 that should have never been recorded. I think if you want to get into the Gimmes buy ""Have a ball"" or ""are a drag"" first."
5,These guys are gonna be BIG!,"Funny that I should discover them *after* I move away from San Francisco. Every song on this album is a winner. It's all embaressingly catchy and you find yourself singing along to it at the top of your lungs. Hell, you already know the words so why not?If you've got a sense of humor and love cheese... buy this album. Not only is it funny the music is great! I'm going to buy 3 copies for 3 different friends cause I know they'll all love it."
4,three absolutely perfect songs and some other good stuff,"if this entire album kept up the raucous, brassy, wonderful, pure, ingenuous rock'n'roll sound of the first three songs, i would have no hesitation in recommending it as the best thing ever to ever come out of sun studios - yes, even better than the king's own sun recordings, which, as things stand, are still the best. 'we wanna boogie', 'red-headed woman', and 'prisoner's song'. look for them. it's probably not worth buying the whole forty dollar box-set like i did, because when those three songs are over, and the trumpet (that trumpet! brilliant!) disappears, the album goes seriously downhill. the other songs are good still, but they just aren't the same ecstatic, frenzied, honest, all-out rock'n'roll that you hear in those first three little miracles."
4,"For Patek collector, good guide with out-of-date prices","For hardcore Patek Philippe fans and collectors only. Not a book of glamour shots but black and white photos, some poor quality at best. Good basic guide to models and prices. Minimal background information on the pieces."
5,A Giant Singer-Songwriter in His Prime,"John Stewart was an American classic! I write this after learning of his passing on January 19, 2008 and I am listening to this wonderful concert once again as I write!I was incredibly fortunate to be in the Phoenix audience when this was recorded. It was an awesome concert! This recording does a great job of capturing the incredible experience. Because of KDKB radio and Bill Compton (Program Manager), John had become a huge star in Phoenix. He deserved the fame and he would have become a national star, if only independent radio wasn't killed off by the commercial pablum which reigns today.My only quibble with this CD is that the vocal comments between songs are attached to the previous track, not the track they introduce.Rest in Peace John! My best wishes to Buffy and the children!"
3,Plax Dental Rinse,"I also got something to wash out my mouth with--Plax Dental Rinse. It is fine except that I would rather have a bigger one, but you don't seem to have that bigger one in your store."
3,So promising...,"I was so excited to do this workout video. I love workout videos, and finally there was something for the alternative set! No more dumb technoish music, no more robotic lame moves. Finally we were going to dance!The problem with this video is challenge. It's a cinch to learn the whole thing after one viewing. And you'd have to add in jumping jacks or something to the choreography to work up a sweat. The warmup isn't well done-- you stretch out cold muscles, which is kind of useless. And since you're learning choreography to one particular song, you have to hear it over, and over.But I still reccomend it, just because the dance moves are cool, and I love to bust out the ""rising sun"" at dance parties. I think it's worth it just to learn the moves, but be forewarned that it's not so much of a vigorous workout."
5,AMERICAN MASTER,"This is a wonderful book on America's greatest living painter. I have alway loved Andrew Wyeth's art, it so singular to him, totally unique. You can tell he was influenced by Whistler, but his work is his own. This book has vivid images of Wyeth's best work and the text is highly informative. I was thrilled when I saw this book, it is the best I have seen on Wyeth's vast catalog of paintings. Wyeth is truly an American Master, thank you Ms. Knutson for a job well done."
3,It could be a bit more realistic!!,".... The 4 characters say the same phrases over and over and I never felt like using up my memory card to save the world tour and unlock other characters. It's not like I was gonna win, anyway. I must admit, though, the 5 courses are pretty good. Japan is easy. U.S.A. gets me in the bunker alot. Scotland has alot of precipitation variations. M y ball always goes into the red clay in Australia. And Africa has a large variety of fairways and obstacles. Gate ball isn't that great because the gates are always in the same exact spots. Other than the graphics and the 5 courses, this game could use some improvement."
3,A Good Game.,"Tee Off is not a great game. But I found it to be very enjoyable. If you are a fan of golf, you will probably like this game. Gameplay is easy to learn and challenging. Still, Tee Off lacks graphically, especially for a Dreamcast game. Most of the courses look the same and could have used more variety. Playing the World Tour option is fun in that it allows you to unlock golf balls, clubs, and new characters. Overall, Tee Off is good but not great."
3,"Great for a while, but they expire too fast","These strips are easy to use, but I didn't notice that they only have a limited shelf life and the following season they were inaccurate. I checked and they'd expired. The 100 count is probably more than you'll use in one year. But it you're aware of this they do save a lot of time. But the price is high for one season of testing."
2,colors not distinct,"Both this Mardel and the Jungle brand sold at pet stores are far inferior to the old store-brand test-strips previously sold by Petco stores. That product, stopped three years ago, offered clear visual contrasts in both color and intensity for the various 6 factors tested. Actually, 5 of the 6 tests on these Mardel strips are fairly okay. The killer is with the all-important ""Ph"" test. Even a small change in color can indicate a big change in acidity level. Distinguishing between colors, and color accuracy, are a challenge here. An unnecessary challenge Mardel/Jungle can fix if they decide to."
4,Oldschool.,"This is one of those animes that can't be judged by today's standards. The first was released in 1986, and to appreciate it you've got to pull yourself away from all the Love Hina-Tenchi-cute robot girl and overly dramatic series like Naruto. While it isn't the best out there, it's a good piece to own if you grew up on anime from this era. Gritty and gorey.So, when you're watching this, forget the year 2000 or so date that this package has and remember that it is in fact from 1986."
2,Mommyof 3Girls,"I thought that this would be a hit because my two older daughters love anything to do with animals, but because the pieces come off easily and the pets are no where to be found this became a toy they never use, except when mommy puts the pieces all together. If you hate to look for pieces, don't buy. Too much trouble!"
1,Who uses CGI anymore?,I was disappointed with this book. It was a little hard to follow and after this book wonder why people use CGI anymore.
2,Not Authentic dim sum cook book. Great recipe book with misleading title!!,"This is no doubt a GREAT recipe book--easy steps, ordinary ingredients, beautiful photos with clear explaination. However, this is not an authentic dim sum cook book!! Most of the recipes--I will say more than 90% of them, are not ""dim sum"". I could see the author loves dim sum and she was also very creative, but putting ""dim sum"" equals ""Asian finger food"" doesn't feel right to me. Dim sum has its own origin and it refines very fine breakfast or brunch food that only served at ""tea restaurant"". Most dim sum don't serve with dipping sauce. Things like chicken skewer would never be called a dim sum dish... I guess if you are looking for a more authentic dim sum cook book, this should not be your first choice. However, if you are looking for a nice, easy cookbook of Asian style cuisine to delight your friends and family, this might just be the one!!"
5,kraft 6x9 envelopes,Thees envelopes are heavier than others I have ordered. I ordered especially with out the metal clasp and these have fit the bill well. I sell batteries on E-Bay and mail trays of 100 that weight 7 ounces in each envelope. No problems as they are heavy enough to withstand the load
1,disappointed,"50% of the envelopes are not glued, all the bottom part are open, it just made me went crazy, i had to tape every single envelope before shipping to my customers. really disappointed"
1,Why?!,"Let's face it - cheesy movies definitely have their place in society. Who hasn't wasted away an evening with frozen pizza, beer and a movie? And once the beer begins to make its mark it really doesn't matter what the little people on your tv are saying and doing. So, in this respect, ""I Spit On Your Corpse"" is a worthy enough movie to fill this niche. But for crying out loud - don't buy the DVD! Just ... rent it as you will not be wanting to watch it twice."
4,OK for this size speakers,"This is my third pair of computer-speakers, and this product from micro innovations ranks OK, for this size speakers. Apart from the somewhat hollow sound you get frrom the plastic casing, it has remarkable bass for such small speakers. Fits on any disk because of the size, so if you're looking for a pair of inexpensive speakers that doesn't take up a lot of space, these speakers may be what you're looking for. But if good sound is the goal, these probably wont satisfy you."
1,"Fine for the price, but...","These are fine for the price and I like the size.These serve my purpose almost exaclty, there's just this one thing. I bought them because I needed some PC speakers with a headphone jack. Uhm, funny thing about that is...there isn't one. Is that false advertisement or do I have to unscrew the casing to find the headphone jack?If you're looking for speakers with a headphone jack, look elsewhere."
2,Not as described,"The speakers that I received did not look like the picture from which I ordered. They are tall and thin, not short and fat (which is specificially what I was looking for). Nor did the system have an AC adapter, which was listed but these speakers are powered by a USB cable. Not what I wanted at all."
4,Was brand new,The product was shipped fast and was in perfect condition when it arrived. Had the plastic wrap still on it and everything. i got it as a gift for my dad and he loved it.
2,Wouldn't have purchased if I'd known...,"I'd have to agree that this is a great selection of Kenny Rogers hits. But I was sorely disappointed in the first five tracks... they aren't Kenny Rogers' most recent (solo) hit recordings of these tracks, but the versions from ""Kenny Rogers & The First Edition."" Sorry, but if I'd wanted Kenny Rogers & The First Edition's greatest hits, then I'd have shopped for that group! I'm shopping again to get the tracks I wanted."
3,This album is great for a starter album,"This album is great for a starter album and includes ""the greatest"",and ""buy me a rose."" This is the only main reason to purchase this album is because those two are on a compilation album, but where is ""slow dance more,"" ""he will, she knows,"" ""there you go again,"" ""write your name"" ""crazy in love"" ""what about me,"" ""ole' red,"" ""if you want to find love,"" ""the factory,"" ""handprints on the wall"" or even ""if i ever fall in love again (with ann murray)?"" I would personally recommend ""through the years"" a four disc box set. It has everything Rogers ever did pretty much up to that point. I love his music but don't think this is the best he could have done with the 90's and beyond material on this album. This is hardly the ultimate collection. I am still waiting for a 90's through 00's greatest hits collection. Kenny Rogers is the best though, and his last album ""back to the well"" is great too."
5,KENNY AT HIS BEST,"This is an excellent sample of KENNY ROGERS music over the years,chronologically arranged from his time with the FIRST EDITION to the present day.There is also a varied selection of duets. I especially like the new song-poem,""WE ARE THE SAME"". A very pleasant collection for any music lover."
3,Ok but not amazing,This cage is NOT big enough for 2 rats!If you are in my place where you had to seperate 2 males due to fighting and you need a fair sized temp cage then its good. I have one male in this cage and its a bit small even for him hes not much more then a pound. This will be a temp cage until I can do better. I will most likely move my male mouse in this cage after my rat moves out.Now all rats should be in pairs example 2 males or 2 females unless something comes up and they have to be seprated if you are getting 2 rats save your money and buy the Super Pet My First Home For Exotics not Critters! Its a large 3 story rat cage you can find it on sale a lot on petsmart.com or amazon.com. This cage is big enough for 3 females or 2 larger males.
2,"High expectations, but it just doesn't cut it.","My wife has issues with her feet, and must tape them on a regular basis to help with the pain. She has been using 1.5 inch tape, but wanted some 2"", which seems to be hard to find. We ordered some of this because it was one of the few sources we could find for anything close to a reasonable price. Shipping took a long time (2.5 weeks), and once it got here, the performance of this tape leaves a lot to be desired. While most tapes she's used last several hours if not all day, this tape will stick for about an hour before pulling loose. It is really almost worthless to her for long-term wear. At least we've figured out that 3M tape isn't workable for our needs. Time to try something else I guess."
4,Pretty Good,"I must say, very good. Alexi shows some awesome solos and riffs, and there is a booklet with full transcriptions of what he plays. You can also download backing tracks at the rockhouse website, which makes it even better. So this is what I like about the DVD.Here are the downpoints: nothing from first three albums!!!! (which are the best ones!)Numerous typing errors in the booklet, such as writing 15 instead of 17 in the are you dead yet riff.The first page of the are you dead yet solo is...missing. He who wrote the booklet ""accidentally"" pasted the in your face solo where the are you dead yet one should have been! The idiot! However, Alexi plays the solo at a slow speed first, so its pretty easy to pick out what he's doing just by looking at him.Buy it!"
2,A Dark Depressing book,"I have read other Denise Mina books including Garnethill and rather enjoyed some but this one is so bleak and depressing. I found that I really didn't care about the characters. All they did was drink, get drunk, take drugs, deal drugs, smoke and swear constntly. It's hard to believe people live like this.I gave it 2 stars only because Ms Mina is indeed a talented writer but her characters are unlikable."
3,I Must Have Missed Something........,"Upon reading the reviews of this book, I quickly added Denise Mina to my ""want to read"" list. Particularly enjoying British/European mysteries, I was very happy to find EXILE. I certainly agree with another reviewer -- read GARNETHILL first as unlike other series novels, I became caught in the muddle and wrap-up of that book. That aside, yes it's very gritty, yes the characters are well written -- I just found the movement of the story at a snail's pace and while character development mysteries tend to move slower, I just found this one far too slow and not as riveting and exciting as I was led to believe. I'd still read another of Denise Mina's books but would not be as quick about it should it come down to one of her books and another's."
3,possibly working...,I just finished my second month. I think I feel a difference so far. Possibly a little more thicker. I sit it on my bathroom sink so it reminds me to put it on. So far ive done good and havent missed a day (twice a day applications)I give it 3 stars because I did notice that it makes me break out around the hairline. I normally dont break out at all so this was unusual for me. Im going to continue using it twice daily for the rest of the 3 months. I will update once the 3 months are up.
4,I See Want I Want to See,"I am 63 and I have a receding hairline. I believe I see results and I do have realistic expectations. And, my husband, a barber, said he sees some results. More importantly, I feel I have some control with respect to my hair loss. I feel better using it. I hope this helps. Cheers!!!"
4,Happy Results,I Started Using Rogaine About A Year And A Half Ago.. The Results Were More Than I Expected.. You Must Use Twice A Day.. Once In The AM.. Again PM.. There Are No Short Cuts.. I'm Very Happy With My Hair Now.. Marie
2,grows fine fuzz; hereditary pattern baldness,"I have used Women's Rogaine for about 3 years for what my dermatologist says is hereditary pattern baldness: loss of hair on my temples and frontal thinning above my forehead. Rogaine produces a short fine fuzz that helps to hide bare skin, but that's all. I stopped for a few months a year ago and the hair loss was more noticeable, so I returned to using Rogaine. Fuzz is better than nothing. My dermatologist said it was difficult to do anything about hereditary pattern baldness."
4,Great poster.,"I bought this for my husband for his birthday. Got it and was pretty impressed. Of course it is a reprint that this company prints out themselves. You can really tell around the top and bottom edges where they dont exactly cut it right. It is on some super thick, glossy poster paper. Picture quality is great. Make sure you look at the size! This is NOT a standard poster size. So you will have to get a custom frame. I went to lots and lots of stores before talking to someone in the custom framing department only to find out they dont carry this size. But all in all, for the price, it is a very nice poster. Especially with it being out of print just about everywhere else."
4,great memories,I purchased this book to recapture the unique style of Ed Dodd's animal illustrations. They was so much a part of his wildlife comic strip stories. His attention to deails bring the animals close to real life. Great follow up book to his first edition.
4,This guy isn't play'n Possum,"The thickness of the tail to deter the tail being pulled loose and the overall quality of construction makes this a good value. Liked the expression on the face, but I realize this is a taste issue."
3,"Overall, a lot of good information...but maybe too much.","Overall, a lot of good information...but maybe too much. The ""what to expect..."" books are a little easier to find answers...but nice job."
5,Grandfather desires,"Hello, I am Writting here because I could not find a proper e-mail were to send my question. I wonder if you could to record a video from a Pathé Baby camera. In others words, my grandfather has movies from 1926 recorded by a Pathé Baby camera and he can not to see it because his reproductor machine is broken and we could not find someone to fix it. ¿could you hepl us? I am forward to hearing from you. Thanks."
5,Beautiful,"Some guys like me, never had the opportuniy to know the great masters of the last century, this is a beautiful DVD, and an excelent documental. The violinist are their sounds, their phrasings, their humanity, some very perfectionist like Heifetz, some very carismatic, like Oistrak, some prodigy like Menuhin, and some interesting personalities like Kogan, Milstein, Szering, Szigeti, all of them big masters of the new style, different in style than Wieniawski, Vieuxtemps, Sarasate, Paganini, Viotti, etc. but not so far from their impresionant habilities. Believe me you really enjoy this CD's, a curiosity, pay attention to all the bowings, are very different, different production of the sound. Two violinist never will play equal, even they are using the same violin, the violinist is his sound not his violin. (Note: The violin helps, but not play alone)."
3,Bumbling Movie,"It kept on going on, without a Plot.It was a Crazy and Complicated movie.I didn't know who was Bad Guy."
1,Cheerfully Awful,"Agressively, earnestly stupid dialog and an insane plot - actually, three or four insane plots, held together by not much at all - so it's a tribute to the human spirit, or something, that a lot of it is really nicely shot, especially the exteriors. Almost a Russ Meyer-ish feel, like the director is having more fun than anybody on the set. A bad movie to show when you have friends over who aren't dead sure about this ""bad movie"" thing.Tommy Kirk demonstrates that, after having fallen from Absent-Minded Professor to Mars Needs Women, it's possible to KEEP FALLING."
4,Pretty good introductory treatment,"Unlike the two systematic studies by Michael L. Bush, to which he refers approvingly, Dewald offers an extended interpretative essay, the theme of which is the evolution of the Continental nobility (or aristocracy -- he regards the terms as overlapping but distinct in meaning) during the four centuries between the end of the Middle Ages and the arrival of the French Revolution. Though small in absolute numbers, the nobility controlled most of the land and all of the politics on the Continent until well into the 19th century, and the author maintains that they managed to do this despite wars, revolutions, and the coming of modern industry because they were very effective in adapting to the changes around them. He also argues that from one country and culture to the next, nobles faced similar problems and responded to them in very similar ways. Intended as an introductory text on the subject, this is an excellent historical survey for the beginning student."
5,99 accord v6 compatibility,"just be ware... my 99 accord does not take part #74649, my part #74647. and you have to use old lever to make it operate properly. my seller did an excellent job to ask me make a picture and identified correct part # for me."
2,Not so great,"I love roots, I love Peter Tosh, and I found this DVD mildly interesting, but not great. Halfway through I lost interest. It lacks the sheer power and 'wow' factor of the live Wailers performances. The backing band seems very average - a very 'synthesized' and not very rootsy sound. Kind of like a session band, not a real roots. The (mostly white) audience looks bored - most are sitting throughout the performance, and Tosh seems to disconnected from them - no real interaction between Tosh and audience. Peter Tosh was a serious activist and grand master of reggae, but somehow this show doesn't capture that. I know Peter Tosh has done some great performances, I'm hoping for better live footage to emerge one day."
4,Finding peace in these troubled times . . .,"Finding rest renewal and delight in our busy lives. This is a wonderful little volume that now starts my day off in a very peaceful and contemplative way.I took my time with this book. I savored each morning as I read only one of the ""meditations"" to start my day and then tried to remember and think about the meditation during the day some time. The Sabbath practices are doable in our every day lives and picking one or two will definitely add a new dimension to your day. And in light of the recent tragedies on our country, we could all use a little peace and Sabbath in our lives."
1,Always buy new,"I purchased a winder that was supposed to be ""like new"". The unit arrived and was old, used and missing the front cover. The insert that holds the watch was worn and worthless. I was able to get my money refunded and return the winder. Alls well that ends well. I will buy new from now on."
2,Disappointed in letter choices,"I ordered these letters because it said there were 36, so obviously there would be some duplicates of highly used letters. Well, I got 36, but here is the breakdown of what I got in addition to 1 of each of the 26 letters:A: 3E: 1G: 1I: 1O: 1S: 1T: 1U: 1So, yes, in total, we now have 4 A's. Not extremely useful.Also, I was disappointed in the style of the letter S. Instead of being curved, it looks like a backwards Z. It just doesn't fit in with the rest of the letters. There was a letter L that looks like a capital L, though, so perhaps the other reviewer that said the L looks like an I got two I's and no L's.Bottom line is that this product definitely wasn't worth the $7 I paid. That said, my 2-year-old daughter likes to play with them, so I will keep them."
2,"The ""I"" and ""L"" are the same!","I got this for my daughter and was not that happy. They do have decent magnets compared to other letters I have seen however, they are not strong enough to hold up a piece of paper. They are a bit smaller then I would like. The thing I disliked the most was the ""I"" and the ""L"" were the same. even though they show a ""L"" in the picture! This is not cool when your daughters name is Cali and it looks like Call with these letters. They were cutting corners to make this product cheaper but failed because I still paid 7.00 for it!! Not only that but it is meant to be an educational toy."
2,Too small to be good.,These letters are way smaller than I had realized. I can't even give them to my granddaughter who is a toddler because they are too small for her and dangerous. But not worth the bother to return them. They are smaller than I realized. I thought they were larger.
2,missing letters,"I bought this because my 1.5 yr old is learning lettes, but it is missing some of the letters. Very upsetting!"
1,"Not for home use, overpriced.","This OS was released because NT was old and failing, it was a Server dependant shell. If you are in a big company with very secret data then WIN 2000 is a good choice. For home use stick with WIN98, without the added security it is much more flexible and user friendly. The poor rating is simply because it is way over priced, Linux is a far...far better operating system in all areas and it's free. Use Linux, you'll be so much happier."
2,should have upgraded to NT instead,"I upgraded to get all the benefits of Windows NT, plus preparing for a Win2000-centric future. First I used the upgrade utility which checks to see which installed software will not be compatable (available on MS's Web site). No problem, armed with this info I got a new Canon printer driver from Canon's Web site; however, the utility didn't warn me about Oracle Lite and Microsoft Magic School Bus games failing! Most of the software and game demos I try to install now get an error message. In retaliation my wife confiscated our older PC and won't let me near it. Now I can't work on my PC and can't play new games, either. So I guess I'll surf newsgroups and write reviews on Amazon.com instead! Thanks for nothing, Microsoft."
4,"MY SON LOVES IT, BUT CAN BE ANNOYING FOR ADULTS","Got a couple of these videos for my son as he enjoys the little people toys. He loves the videos and still watches them a couple years later. Good lessons in the stories, but the songs and voices can get annoying...also the theme song that plays before every scene/story."
1,"Evidently, this actress had an affair with the director","I mean, come on, she had to have. I haven't seen a performance this pitiful since Renee Zwelieger starred in the new Texas Chainsaw Massacre. She is just no Rose McGowan. The girl's anger and hurt is reminiscent of the anger and hurt shown by an actress in a Midol commercial. As a matter of fact, that is probably the only thing she is capable of doing--advertising for Midol or Preparation H. See this film if you really feel the need to scratch your eyes out."
2,"What Happened to ""Charlie""?","If I were to rate the album ""Charlie"" by Tompall, I would definitely give it a five star rating--or even a six if there was such a thing--as it seems to reflect more of who the artist really is. As for ""Rouge"", I would like to reserve judgment at this time; I am sorry, I cannot give it an equivalent rating. I would hope Tompall would produce more records of the calibre of ""Charlie"" some time in the future. As one who has spent many years researching, from a sociological point of view, the (mis)adventures of America's unsung ""heros"", ""outlaws"", ""renegades"" ""rogues"", and such from the political, legal and journalistic arenas, I know there are a lot of them ""out there"" who could use some ""Charlie"" music."
2,Expected KIDS but got infants.,"I bought this movie based on the cover description only which from this it looked like it may be like KIDS, which is an excellent movie. This movie showed me why Shannon Elizabeth has never played a major role. They actors were a joke. I've seen high school plays better than this. The only reason I gave it two stars is that it had a decent message in it. The movie is about teenagers in a drug and rave filled society, however it took forever to get to this. A young guy who designs clothing takes kids that he finds on the streets and shows them a better life by hiring them to work in his store. This is all because of his childhood and he doesn't want them to go through the things he has. This guys jealous friend shows these kids real drugs and that's when the turning point of the movie happens. If you are dead set on seeing this film, rent it. It's not worth the $3 however."
4,Fantastic,"I just got this cd not knowing what to expect. I am so pleased I followed my spirit and got it. The music is excellent. The lyrics are powerful and full of meaning. It is spoken word hip hop, jazz, orisha chants,and funky beats to bring it together. But more than that, it is Pure Spirit. Only one request for the next one. Can a sistah get some Shango energy up in there. Cabio sele' Sango.Ashe"
5,"Wonderful, funny, heartwarming and heartbreaking.","We were delighted to purchase this movie on DVD. We originally had it on Laser Disc in 1993 and loved it 20 years ago as well. It is full of nostalgia for an America which is fast becoming a memory and it tells its story with humor, pathos and irony. The acting is delightful and very effective. The family drama involved will be familiar to everyone and will pluck your heartstrings to a fare-thee-well! This is not a fast paced action movie but one which is more like a slice of real life with all of its' ups and downs and the happiness and sadness associated with weddnigs and funerals. Trust us, it's a keeper!"
4,Thoroughly Enjoyed and Now Looking Forward to Last Breath!,"I bought Last Breath before 18 Seconds but wanted to read the first Sherry Moore book before it. So I purchased this one and I am very thankful that I purchased Last Breath. I thoroughly enjoyed the characters in 18 Seconds and I am most looking forward to more of Sherry Moore. I was a little disappointed in the lack of her presence but knowing there are 2 more Sherry Moore novels, I pushed that aside. I will say, the character of Dillon was unnecessary. Just didn't see a point to him.Overall, I highly recommend George Shuman.Brian WeissNova DevelopmentFor more information, visit www.novadevelopment.com"
5,18 Seconds is not just another thriller,"I'll admit I was a bit skeptical when I first picked up the book 18 Seconds. I'm not a paranormal genre fan and while the parallel story lines in the first few chapters confused me, I was hooked early on. This is not your average first novel. It could only have been written by someone who understands human behavior both good and depraved. The blind Sherry Moore who can ""see"" what a deceased person saw in the last 18 seconds of their life is a refreshing new character. I also felt the character of lieutanant Kelly O'Shaughnessy to be extremely believable. Mr. Shuman's ability to weave story lines that make you think you know what will happen, but then leave the reader stunned is amazing. The ending is heartstopping and very realistic. This author knows people and knows how to make fictional characters from that knowledge. Terrific first novel."
5,Joey Cstle,Good CD on little known Rockabilly artist Joey Castle.Joey had the early MGM Conway Twitty style.Still a great lineup of Rock and Roll tunes.Bear Family does it again.Rockabilly at its best.

4,Jimi Fuzz Wah Rules,Nice combo pedal for BOTH effects of that era....BUT...takes a little getting used to when attempting to turn the FUZZ on from a SIDE pedal button instead of the MAIN stomp switch.
1,OK while it lasted,"I purchased this monitor in January '09, and it is now very fuzzy (it's been 8 months) and Gateway said it is not under warranty. I basically have to pay to get it repaired or toss it and get something else. Oh - I also have the option of paying Gateway tech support to tell me to repair it or toss it. No thanks.This monitor is also small. If you are buying it online, make sure you look at the size specs. I bought it online and was disappointed."
3,I don't know...,"As a computer professional I've worked with many different flavors of OS. When Micro$oft announced the corp preview plan, I ordered Windows 2000 Professional and Server. I installed Professional on my laptop and server on my server. The laptop did well (128meg PII366) The server however was completely hosed by the install and had to be reformated and I honestly did not try to install Win2K server again. The laptop did well untill 6pm local time Dec 31 when it stopped booting and had to use the manufacturer's recovery disk to install the original OS. I think I'll give Win2K a miss for now and stick to FreeBSD for critical server applications and Win98 for the fun box. Unless I buy that dual CPU motherboard."
4,Descibed exactly on site,This is a basic brown clasp envelope made well using quality paper. Thick enough to protect contents without adding too much shipping weight.
2,Just a fancy item,"Just a fancy item , dsnt serve the purpose in a very sunny day. Too transperant to hold out the sun"
4,Critter missing,The critters that are included are pretty well done but some game animals aren't included. They could have mentioned the missing animals and told you what critter would come the closest to matching it.
1,waste of money,This was a waste of money didn't help at all. Would never buy it again go with good stuff. No good.
3,"Eh, it's OK","It's good for me nutritionaly, but has not done what I expected. I will not purchase again, for the simple fact that it is $90 or more for a 3 month supply, and I can't afford that much. Especially since it did not meet my expectations."
4,Communism: A History by R. Pipes - Book review,"Communism: A History by Richard Pipes is a brief, well put together and clearly presented pocket history of communism from its Marxist beginnings to the present. It's almost like 'Communism 101', a starter if you like which might lead to further reading and study. I enjoyed the book very much. One needs to keep in mind that Pipes is a noted anti communist, though to what effect his strong anti-communist feelings have influenced this book I am unable to tell.Pipes is, however, a well respected (by some) historian and his knowledge of Russia's history is probably unrivalled in the West.I recomend the book to anyone wanting a simple, easy to read and succinct history of communism."
1,hate filled polemic,"Pipes' utter and complete disprespect of the russian people in general and communists in particular oozes out of every paragraph of this book. According to him, nothing, absolutely nothing good ever came out of the soviet union. Every action taken by the communist party was a complete failure. Communism turned the entire russian people into alcoholic slackers incapable of accomplishing anything. I can see exactly where President Reagan got his russophobia from. Don't waste your time with this book. To quote the Sting song, ""...the russians love their children, too."" But you wouldn't know it from this book."
3,Ok for it's price.,"I was a bit disappointed in the product. It doesn't shoot too straight, and the laser pointer is WAY off. I was also disappointed to see that the stock doesn't extend.However, considering it is a low price for this style of Airsoft gun, it does what it should for the price. It does shoot straight enough to get the job done. It came with lots of cool accessories.My advice to buyers: This is a good item for less serious play, or for novelty use. For more hardcore Airsoft fans, or for someone looking for a more reliable gun, look a little more expensive."
5,Great,"These envelopes are great. Just regular envelopes, and they look and work fine. I don't use applied glue, so I don't care if it works or not."
4,"Great envelopes, as described!",These are just as described in the advertisement. The glue holds well and they are sturdy and not cheap looking. Not sure what else to say.
2,Not for rats!,"I bought this cage for my daughter's two female rats and was very disappointed upon taking it out of the box. The bars are way too wide for smaller rats. The second we put them in the slipped right back out. We immediately packed it back up and had to pay the return shipping. Though it is advertised as a small furry animal cage and other reviewers commented on it being a great cage for rodents, we did not find this to be the case. If you are buying for a rat(s) be sure to buy a cage that is described as being specifically for rats."
5,Great house for your Bunny.,My Lionhead Bunny loves this house.She loves to go for level to level.She sleeps on the top level.Easy set up and clean.Hope this helps.
4,Pretty Good,"I was suprised by this movie. Most of the exposure that I have had to Zelman King was through Red Shoe Diaries, so because of that I was expecting mostly mild titalation with some decent excuse for a plot. What I found in this film was something I never expected. Instead of sex and steamy dialogue (which there is some) you are instead given a somewhat confusing, yet suprisingly interesting plot. Most of the actors do really well with their parts (although at times two of the actresses totally bomb off the screen). I would recomend this to anyone who enjoys pulp type cinema, because this has all the makings of a Jackie Collins novel.*Although not rated this would probably get an R rating."
2,There Has To Be a Plot Here Somewhere,"Okay, I can appreciate a cheesy, wafer-thin plot to make room for the steamy scenes, but this movie has neither. It thought it was going to be soft porn, but it didn't work out. But by the time you realize this, you have already lost interest in the plot, for the simple reason that there really isn't one. This is one of the few films actress Sandra Taylor ever starred in, so it's worth picking up if you're a fan. But if you're just looking to see if maybe Zalman King has finally done a nice steamy movie that doesn't involve David Duchovny and a small dog, you're wasting your time - he hasn't."
4,haven't used it yet,"The head set/microphone looks well made, but I haven't used it yet. Amazon wanted a review so I am writing this one from the road. Earlier reviews said it was a good product for the money and I have no reason to doubt that."
4,Its great for the price,"I bought this last december and i used it for my psp,sad part about this is it has 2 chords,one for mic and one for headphones. If it only had one then it wouldve been perfect.But yeah overall i have used this for computer as well and it works swell.I played Socom,star wars and listened to my music and it handles everything.The slight bad part of it is that if someone were to pull the wires out of the computer or what ever you have the headset hooked up to,the wire would mess up in the inside,like with what happened to mine,Siblings pulled it out of my psp and it easily broke.Mic still worked for some time but it went out a couple weeks later. Over all its a good item,just be careful when unplugging it."
5,cant wait for the next series to come out!!!!!!!,"I am a 31 yr old man, and I loved this DVD. To bad the show was cancelled off the air but now I have it uninterrupted,free of commercials and stuff. Iwish that there were some behind the scenes makings of roughnecks, but the most important thing is the show itself. It's very realistic,my two boys could care less about it but thats because some of the dialog is what adults would talk about. all in all its a great DVD. I just want to make sure I'm on the list for the next DVD release."
5,MAGNIFICENT JOB!!!,ONE HECK OF A BOOK! IT KEPT MY INTEREST SO MUCH THAT IT WAS VERY HAD TO PUT DOWN. EVERY CHAPTER KEPT YOU EXCITED AND CURIOUS. I HOPE TO SEE ANOTHER BOOK BY THIS AUTHUR IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE!
2,Not for Guinea pigs,"We bought this cage for our 2 Guinea pigs, ages 1 and 4, after seeing the customer images of it with G. pigs and reading some of the reviews. This cage is not for Guinea pigs. The ramps are too steep, even with the shelves set at their lowest level. Their little stubby legs and bodies can't go up them and the only way they can get down is to slide. The floor area is adequate for G. pigs - however, since I am not going to use the shelves and ramps, the cage is awkwardly tall. It is also too low to the ground. I am going to move them back to their old cage which is on legs and has a larger floor space. All in all, as a G. pig owner, I am very disappointed in this purchase. It would be nice for a ferret, as pictured on the box. However, for G. pigs, it is not a good cage at all."
1,Maddon NFL 2003,"I have a question for all the reviewers, professional and otherwise, how can you write a favorable review on a software program that I, like several other people I know, cannot get the game to install even on ""state of the art"" computers. Further and in my experience, EA as an organization, give only lip service to customer/tech support. The Madden franchise, in my opinion are poorly designed, faulty products. It should be avoided, no matter how much you love football, at all costs.Unless, of course, unable to install, constant crashes(Madden 2002), and failure to issue roster updates is your forteNote to PC sport games - Oh great Microsoft, have pity on the poor pc gamer and bring back NFL fever to us"
3,Better than 2002 - Nowhere close to Segas NFL2K Series,"Madden 2003 is at least a playable football game for the pc. I have owned just about every football game for the pc since the FPS football series and there hasnt been much. With no football game of value on the pc, I bought a dreamcast just to play the sega sports NFL2K series. When madden 2002 came out, I borrowed a copy from a friend and it was the worst game since total control football! After the dreamcast went under, I didnt want to buy another console, so I resigned myself to not having football game that was current to play.After reading several articles on Madden 2003, I decided that I would give it a shot. I will have to say that it is 100% better than 2002, but it is still not as good as sega's NFL2K series. I would suggest this game to anyone that is craving football on their pc, it will get you thru until somebody remembers us pc sports gamers."
1,Not long enough,"Bought this item because i needed the wire to be long, but when i recieved it the wire is alot smaller than i thought it would be. I was very disapointed.. the wire was like aproxx 3-4in. :/ ...Back- Just installed 4/24/11.. Bulbs got to hot and blew out within a couple of HOURS. Would not recommend."
2,"Okay for display, but a crummy toy","I bought this for my son, a budding robot fanatic, thinking he'd enjoy a robot that turns into a spaceship (and also thinking that a metal toy might hold up better than plastic). Unfortunately this line of Transformers is constructed such that they fall to pieces very easily, making it virtually impossible for a kid to play with. The pieces do snap back together, but a toy that falls apart every time you touch it isn't much fun for a kid. We also bought another titanium series Transformer character as a gift and that one suffers from the same problem as well. Maybe an older Transformers fan might appreciate these for display. Note, however, that the figure in no way attaches to the provided display stand; it tends to topple off the stand at the slightest tremor and, of course, fall to pieces on landing."
2,not so hot,The Rocky worked for about 2 or 3 tries then the arm didn't punch any more but the voice still does thats way I kept it
4,"Good, sturdy canopy...",I purchased this last year for $139 and I have to say that it was well worth it. I have used it several times for camping. This canopy is sturdy and well made. Granted the legs aren't as thick as the Commercial brands but its half the price. It is certainly better the EZ canopies that seem like twigs in comparison. So if you are in the market for a mid-level canopy this is a great product. I have to agree with others in saying that the screen takes some work the put on. I can actually put up the canopy by myself in a couple minutes but I need help with the screen - I have someone hold and stretch the screen to fit so I don't rip it. It's snug but wouldn't you think that's a good thing to keep the mosquitoes out?
4,Great price. Fast delivery.,"Great price. Fast delivery. Looks good in the yard. Taller than most tents of this type. Easy set up. I got the screen option. Works great. I can enjoy sitting outside. Seems to leak a little when raining though. Neighbors like it, asked where I got it."
4,Definitely Worth it.,"I bought this as an upgrade from an RCA ANT1250 (also amplified) and it was well worth it. I don't want cable and this does the job quite well. It doesn't take up very much space, and came with a nice little instruction booklet about how to adjust the dipoles etc. The previous review of this antenna was right on."
3,Positive tale of woman preacher through a small lens,"Scheming grandmother Maisey Walton ensures foreign-correspondent grandson Richard and beloved single preacher Anna Louise have time together, and isn't disappointed when love develops. Unrealistic take on Richard - points, however, for just being aware there is a world beyond romance. Anna Louise is a little too good to be true, but at least it portrays women pastors positively. I don't read much romantic fiction, so I guess this is fine for the genre."
3,Good enough...,I got it looking for basic radar functions (detection) at an afordable price. I am the kind of person that does not care if it speaks or beeps.The device is good but the mounting system just broke after a couple of months (I had to fix it with some glue).The radar works well.
4,Excellent product!,"Decent box of vocabulary cards that have the pronunciation, definition, synonym and sentence on each card. The only drawback is that the cards are printed on flimsy paper so they can easily bend if not held properly. Other then that, I think they are a good learning tool for people who are too lazy to make their own vocabulary cards."
2,Flashcards are flimsy and time consuming,"These are NOT 3x5 or 5x8 flash cards. This is a book in which one has to cut out the flimsy and see-through 2"" x 8.5"" half pages with the word on one side and the definition on the other. One can not simply rip them out, because each page has two words, so cutting is absolutely necessary. I have found a more comprehesive list of words, as well as common roots, suffixes and prefixes, from the Barron's GRE Study Guide and am making my own flash cards from them."
5,Increasing your vocab,"While it is nothing more than vocab words...I found it really helpful and has already started helping me improve my vocab. Imporving your vocab is a hard thing to do, and I think that this simple book does a great job with it!!"
3,"Flimsy, thin flash cards","I recommend the Barron's GRE Flash Cards. The Kaplan flash cards are thin, and flimsy. In addition, the cards contain 500 of the hardest GRE words, not the most frequent or likely GRE words."
5,Best vocabulary flashcards!,"This little book is easy to carry, you can study the vocabulary words and their meaning anytime!"
1,Why didn't I read the reviews?,"Annoyed that they're not flash cards. This makes putting the tough words in your pocket to practice throughout the day. I've yet to take scissors to the flip book to make flash cards, but perhaps that will work well."
4,Helpful Flashcards,"500 words isn't too much to handle. With other books there is a ""comprehensive"" list of thousands of words and it is far too daunting. 500 words is managable and knowing these words well will help with many many others.I went through parts of the book every night for 1 month and saw my scores increase steadily on practice exams before the real deal. It went well."
4,GRE Vocabulary,The vocabulary in a box could be very useful as long as a person was self-disciplined and selected several words a day to expand their vocabulary. This is not a test prep product to be used for a study session but rather a test prep product to be used over a period of time. The vocabulary words were certainly useful and the definitions were well written for easy interpretation and understanding.
5,Great source for studying.,"I received this order in five days and the book was in great condition. It has been very helpful to me, while studying for the GRE."
5,Very helpful!,"So far I really like these flash cards. I haven't spent too much time with them yet. I would say I'm about 20% through them but so far I really like them. I like the flashcard vs. a book design. They have the definition, use in a sentence, and synonyms which is very helpful!"
3,Too much effort for too little pay off.,"First, let me say I loved Ti West's House of the Devil. I loved his willingness as a director to take his time, build tension, and then hit you with a hammer. I was so excited to the see The Innkeepers. If you're a fan, take the time to support Mr. West and independent horror, but...While this film also took its time and built tension, it never really paid off. Sure the performances were strong and believable. Sure the protagonists were cute and endearing. Sure there is an element of danger under the surface, but it never really comes together. The ending would have been more satisfying had it not taken so much time to arrive. The ending is believable enough and bears the hall marks of solid Twilight Zone episode, but again, I wanted more for my time and ten bucks.I will definitely continue to follow Ti West. He is a fantastic director in training, but The Innkeepers left me wanting."
3,"Good acting, but too long","The total experience of this movie would be have been improved if the editors would have cut about 30-55 minutes of the slow and 'dead space' time. The actors are good, the story ok (not unusual), the background music superb for enhancing suspense, but the pace crawls until the end. I would have stopped half way through but I liked the young female actor and wanted to see what happened."
5,"Good, old fashioned, spook movie!","The only explanation for the bad reviews on here is that people expect it to be a gore fest that throws a lot of graphic, over-the-top CGI in your face. Today's Attention Deficit Disorder audiences want things fast and furious, and to not have to think. This movie is not for them. It is a good, old fashioned spook story that relies on good character development, takes its time to tell its story, and creates its chills by getting you to use your own imagination. It is more about what you don't see, then what you do see. The flaw is its ending, which does pander a tiny bit to what modern audiences expect from horror films, and only looks ridiculous in the attempt. However, this is only a minor flaw in what is overall a good thrill for people who like their chills to be realistic and intelligent."
1,Total waste of time,"Absolutely boring. Not suspenseful or scary. I was hoping for a good ""haunted house"" story but this was just plain dull."
2,A waste of money,For a $10 rental I was expecting allot more out of this movie. It just dragged and dragged. The plot was almost non-existent and Sarah Paxton's performance reminded me a bit too much of Kristen Stewart and her unsubtle awkwardness.
2,Poor writing.,There is a lot of unnecessary dialogue that doesn't do much to move the plot or develop the characters. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
1,The Innkeepers,"I was thrilled when i bought this in anticipation of many scares, boy was this a let down. Yes there were probably three scares in the whole film which left long, drawn out segments of nothingness. A bored girl a bored guy boring us the viewers. Seems the director had a great idea for a short film, not a full length feature. Save your money and spend it on some really good edge of your seat thrillers."
1,Attractive but dysfunctional,"The handle on this crock comes off way too easily! When taking it out to the compost bin, invariably the handle would come off. Please note that I am using the past tense. This problem was it's demise. Recommend getting a nonbreakable container such as stainless steel. Compost is a slippery, wet, and kind of gross situation and while this is nice looking, it is impractical and creates an unstable situation."
3,Slightly bent,"The main yoke was slightly crooked, defiantly not a precision job! Other than that it works fine. I'm not entirely sure that the metal used in this is as strong as it could be."
4,Christmas present,"This was purchased as a 'novelty' Christmas present for a family member who owns several pecan trees. Turns out that he said he is using it to crack pecans, too."
4,Great,"Great nutcracker. Did just as expected. Cracked all sorts of nuts. Its adorable, got it for my 9 yr old niece who loves squirrels she loved it!! Arrived quickly."
1,Dont explect to crack any nuts.,"Although this squirrel is a nice touch to your decor, you may not want to put away the other nut crackers just yet. Almonds get stuck up in its mouth if put in one way and shatter if put in the other way. Walnuts and Pecans are quite difficult to crack and just like the Almonds end up shattering to little pieces. Its not easy to open a single nut because the design is poor; it seems like a good way at first glance but is horrible. I would highly recommend to anyone who considers buying this to not, buy a squirrel statue and a good old fashioned nut cracker and you'll be much happier!"
5,Best of the Best,"As an ""old cowhand"" who heard many of these selections originally on 78's, it was a real pleasure to find this CD. Tex is the best of the best when it comes to crooning out the old numbers (Jack o Diamonds) as well as the newer songs. No collection of western country is complete without this album."
4,Aquired Taste,"I didn't like this film the first time I saw it, but after watching it again I grew a liking to it. It's sort of an Indie film and it grows on you after a while. Jimmy Fallon is a laugh as always."
5,Perfect for on the go!,I love this dispenser! We live about an hour from both our families so when we visit we need to take plenty of formula. This allows us to take enough for the whole day. I always keep it full in the diaper bag casue you never know when you might need it! Very nice!
5,I recommend everyone to read this book.,Most Christians practice tithing but many do not use the affirmation as outlined by Victor Boc. The Bible teaches us to believewhen we ask in order to receive..Victor has really put the two important steps tofinancial independence very clearly.He goes over the points over and over againto show the importance and how easy it is.I will defintely give it a try.
1,Yam treats,"These treats are gummy and if you have a long-haired dog, the yam gets all gummed up in their fur and then the dog needs a bath. I don't recommend these treats for any dog with long hair. Very messy!"
2,treats,These were recommended by a vet office because my dog was allergic to raw hide. Unfortunately my dog got the runs using this product so we quit. Other people swear by it.
2,This would have made a great novel!!!!!!,"This book contained so much background information on places that it did not really help me much as a DM. It is great for a history lesson, but would have been more interesting if written as two seperate novels. It mainly gives background info on New Orleans and surrounding areas, as well as a port in good old Russia. Also don't let the picture above fool you. This is not the picture that I had on the book I received. It was a pitcure of a Vooduan buying body organs. The only helpful thing in the book for me was information on Talisleggin and organleggin. This is the aquisition and sell of talismen materials as well as, organs and body parts."
4,You will only buy it if you need it and the reviews won't matter,"The only reason you would ever buy this is if yours was broke and you need a replacement, so reviews don't matter"
1,TERRIBLE- Poor manufacturing,"I go through at least one cover every 6 months. As stated in other reviews the clips are very fragile where they join the cover. I have had one break in the running filter, it was fine when I cleaned the filter and broken the next time I opened it. You would think that they would have fixed this over all of these years.I love Fluval filters but this makes me very disappointed in Hagen and hesitant to purchase their products in the future."
2,For Camcorders,I wanted a step down ring for my 35 mm 24-120 Nikon lens. I did a Google search and this one came up.You cannot screw this adapter onto your lens. It has no screw-in ring EXCEPT for the 52 mm filter that screws into the middle of this adapter.If you want to use it you must use artist's black masking tape to attach it to your lens. This ring creates a huge vignette which is why I bought it. Not worth sending back but not a cheap lesson either.Product information and picture is deceiving.
1,"Very small individual Round Baker, Red","I really thought this was a big enough bowl to make soup for a family of 6 and it turns out that this is made to fill enough soup for 1 only. This is a great item, I was just misled to think it was a large dutch oven. Next time I make individual French Onion Soup this will come in handy."
1,WARNING!!! Not the original recordings,"This is probably not the original ""Slave"" band from the 70s-80s and they've misleadingly named it ""Funk Essentials"" after the popular funk compilations. These are all either new songs or replayed classics. If you want the Slave collection, pick up Rhino's ""Stellar Fungk: The Best of Slave""."
5,What a page turner,Wow I couldn't put this book down once i started reading it. Written beautiful and great insight into the poker world. Love it and hope another book comes out like this soon
2,Interesting but it won't help your game,"Im more interested in books that help me win. This has some nice stories, well written by a real nice guy, but not what I was looking for."
2,Too much discussion from Barry about what a great person he is...,If you wan't to hear Barry go on and on about how great he is (in a cleverly modest way) then this is the book for you. It does contain useful poke info directed at high level players but it has too much stuff about how Barry donates to charity. Certainly not critizing him for donating to charity - just don't want to read about it in a poker book....
1,Guide to nothing,Reading this book was the worst time spent ever. I learned nothing I didn't already know. If you really want to learn some new things and know thats what you are doing and not wasting time purchase Dan Harrington's boooks.
3,"Beautiful Book, NOT and ADVANCED POKER GUIDE","This is a gorgeous book. The pictures are great, and offer a nice backdrop to the material. It's a quick read, and if you are not familiar with the culture of Brick and Mortar Poker you will find it informative.This book would get 5 stars if it was sub-titled ""A beginners guide to brick and mortar poker"". If you are looking for any deep insights into advanced play, you won't find much here. He does have hand examples, which are very informative, and well presented, but the content and lessons don't offer much when compared to ""The Theory of Poker"" or ""Harrington on Hold'em vols 1 & 2"". It's a great addition to your poker library, and I did like the book, but I was expecting much more in the way of No-Limit advanced instruction and it came up short."
2,just kinda there,if the cat couldn't Sing then I'd say a straight up one.the Material here is strickly by the numbers&you don't hear any Growth what so ever on this Project.Somewhere Between R.Kelly&Keith Sweat is Gerald Levert lurking to come out but He just doesn't have them kind of songs in Him.He instead settles for safe Formula.I Respect His Talent&Whatnot but you'd think the Brother would be tired of going ON BET for Every Event&Given Every Other Artist a Tribute as to Himself.well His Material as a Solo Artist still hasn't reached the Cross-Over that He got with Levert.I still Prefer His Pop's Voice&Presentation to His.
1,Wish they had a ZERO!!!,"I had this ordered almost a month and cancelled and got other cds, and I'm glad cause it looks like nobody has gotten, just going by the reviews...NONE!!! I'll just wait for the Stateside Release. SO i know i'm getting their New Cd"
2,Jane Seymour's talent is wasted in this film,"Jane Seymour is beautiful and I love her, but she deserved a better movie here. This is a paint-by numbers made for tv thriller. Not bad but not worth a lot of money, in fact it often plays on cable and is worth watching there."
3,good starter,"I bought this video for my Mom, who has watched the show for years. I thought the first shows ever would make her happy. But not all the cast members were in place........it's very funny...and I've watched it many times. This year....maybe I buy her a newer model. David Lloyd"
2,Too much text!,"I know it's a text book, but there are seriously too many words in this book. It does not present the information in a manageable way. One must laborously read through boring paragraph after another to understand simple concepts. Examples are also spread out throughout the chapter - one must keep back-tracking to follow along."
4,Works well if you don't have to move it too much.,"This is a very effective way to kill weeds, and everything else nearby. Be aware that you have to hold the torch over the weeds for a few seconds to singe them, and if you have a large area to cover, it is a very slow process. You also need to rig up some way to transport the tank - we put it in a wagon but it was awkward."
1,Caution - misleading book title,This book is NOT about wine labels but rather about BOTTLE tags - particularly those made of silver or other metals that hang around the necks of bottles. It is probably a good guide for collectors of these bottle tags or metal hang-tags but of no use to those interested in paper labels.
3,Triangle,"This was a good book. I did enjoy it, but it was very easy to figure out the mystery only a third of the way into the novel. It did give a lot of accurate history, and a good description of the time period. It's a good book. Not the best I've ever read, but adequate for a quick summer read."
3,Above average book,"I enjoyed the historical details of the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory fire. Weber does an excellent job describing the fire and the chaos both physically and emotionally of the trapped workers. The storyline in general has great potential but falls short and there were some parts of the book that bothered me. First, the details of George's music writing became tedious. I appreciated the knowledge of how he composes music but often times the book would go into great detail and become quite tedious. Also, I was a bit disappointed in the character development. I found George and Rebecca's relationship to be strange and unfeeling. I just found the characters in this book very unusual -- I couldn't relate to any of them and if I met them, I probably wouldn't want to be friends with them. I think I would only recommend this book to someone who truly loves the art of music composition because that is what is best detailed in this book."
2,Obtuse,"The Triangle Fire is an important event in American history, particularlyAmerican Labor history, and if you want to learn about it in novelform this is the book for you. Unfortunately, the writing is pedestrian,the characters one-dimensional and the storyline far fetched. Weberis no Lahiri but she is not totally devoid of talent and, perhapsbecause I was very interested in the topic, I am glad I read this book."
2,Triangle,"The fire at the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory in 1911 is the basis for this story. At age 106, Esther is the oldest living survivor of the fire. She is interviewed by a most extremely obnoxious and insensitive researcher, who badgers not only the aged Esther, but her granddaughter as well. Why the granddaughter ever agreed to meet the interviewer defies logic. The story fluctuates between the grandmother's story of the fire, which is told in bits and pieces, and her 50ish granddaughter and her lover. The latter pair are a medical researcher and a musician, respectively. We learn too much about them and not enough about the grandmother.The only interesting character in the book is the grandmother and we don't learn nearly enough about her."
2,Marginal quality,Material and construction of this item is good but it was shipped crushed into a plastic bag. When removed from the bag the shape of the hat was very poor - not like the picture. Thought it might recover with time but it did not. Instead of looking fun it looks cheap.
2,Not the best....battery does not hold a charge.,At first I liked the dock to go with my DX3500 camera. It's sleek. The one-touch transfer thing is pretty cool and I liked the idea of a rechargable battery. I also likes the idea of the indicator lights. HOWEVER: The battery does not hold a charge. I was using AA lithium batteries that would last for 1000 pictures on high res with the flash. The rechargable battery does not last past 50 pictures. Sometimes even less. I called Kodak and they told me I have to take the battery out after the third light shines and then put it back in and continue charging until the charge time reaches 2.5 hours. That didn't work. I'm pretty frustrated with it.
1,Doesn't CHARGE!!!!!,"Read the other reviews. THe dock is ok for transferring pix but it won't charge batteries. I Have sent my camera, dock, and batteries to Kodak twice and I still get the same Lame answer. They seem to think 5-10 pix on a charge is ok. This is ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't buy it or the Kodak rechargeable batteries!!!!"
2,Only for completists.,"While it might be nice to watch ANY Rick Wakeman video, this is about the lowest quality one should stoop to. The video's visual quality is adequate, and does not suffer from over-production. As for the audio? A sad excuse. It's old style lo-fi mono; poor tv sound. And to add insult to injury, it comes with a CD! Unlistenable without the video. For completists only."
3,Yawn,"A child lives inside the walls of a families new house. Do you want to read on NO!!! He knows ""magic"" which he calls alchemistry. Who cares Not ME!!!! Why does it get three stars, it ilearned a little about thingd that i am never going to use in everyday life!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!YAWN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Love it!,"This product was great. Looks awesome, just like on the website. A lot cheaper on here than in department stores. Definitely worth buying!"
1,Possibly Chow Yun Fat's lowest moment,"Too long, badly scripted, terribly acted, cheap special effects, and full of plot points stolen from other movies (like Yojimbo)."
1,less interesting than you'd expect,"story was not too good, acting was sub-par. blu ray video and audio was fine. Chow Yun-Fat probably did this just for the $"
1,a waste of money,I bought both of these CDs during christmas and it was nothing but a waste of money.These phone calls seem funnier only when watching them on the show.Volume 2 is even worse. I love prank phone calls but this CD just didn't make me laugh as much as TTT did.I thought these calls were gong to be funnier.But like i said these calls are only funny when watching the TV shows.
2,Anchoress of Shere,"I was expecting more about the concept of an Anchoress in the middle ages, but what I read was a more romantic/erotic version of young women in peril by demented men. The author should have just stayed with the story of Christine Carpenter and forget about linking the story with a modern 1960's woman."
2,Graphic and sadistic,"A well written book but the graphic description of rape and torture was gratuitous. The characters and the story were engrossing, the suspense and horror palpable but I found it difficult to keep going after the first violent chapter."
5,What a great party!,"This is a great book! I have been interested in spanish cooking and decided to take the plunge into buying a recipe book. This one was a hit! I immediately threw together a Margarita & Tapas party that included the cheese puffs, egg-fried ham sandwiches, banderillas, and chorizo puffs (to name a few) from the book.The directions are easy to follow and the color photos are beautiful."
1,did not work with my fluval,"that was a total waist of money. Even though it said it would work, it did not. What a waist, ended up having to buy a new unit."
5,Show tune Holy Grail,"For those collectors looking for the rarest of rare in musical theater and ready to pay for it, this box set is the only current way to get one of the Holy Grails of musical recordings, ""Mrs. Patterson"". In addition, you get most of her hits from her first stage outting in ""New Faces of 1952."""
5,dolpin story book,i love dolphin stories because it's about nine different dolphins and notdescibing what they look like. i finnally found what i was looking for from amazon.
1,"didn't work, returned it","Luckily I had read other reviews, so I wasn't surprised that it didn't work. The sad thing is when the kids get frustrated because it's not working, and then disappointed because we have to send it back..."
5,One of the all time greatest books of Science Fiction,"I have read this book so many times I practically have it committed to memory. This is probably the best book ever written by Sheri S. Tepper, and maybe one of the best science fiction books ever written. One of the things I like best about it is her use of horses and the parody of the sport of fox hunting. That is only one small part of this book, though. There are numerous sub plots which could make this a difficult book to read, but Ms. Tepper handles it with such facility that it reads very smoothly. I really recommend this book, especially if you like horses, too!"
5,Really great read,"Although this book is long, I was kept interested and intrigued throughout. The characters are really well developed, and it has a great level of complexity without being one of those books where you just lose the plot.........oh yeah - and its a great story too!"
5,Great product,This is manufactured by a company known for making top quality electronics. It is made in Finland and you can tell.
2,scissors,The scissors perfect. The only problem was they took much longer to get to me than i thought they would
3,lots of brand selling but some useful info..,"The book gives one an impression that it is hurriedly written and put together. also, a warning - a lot of Oracle brand selling. the first part deals with a historical narrative of disruptive n revolutionary technologies, not particularly helpful (depending on what you are looking for) the last part talks about the shape of things to come - again gives one a feeling of hurriedly being put together. the middle part about current companies and exchanges operating in the field and also discussions on various ebusiness goals offers a peek into the detailed workings of a ebusiness suite for b2bs, which is pretty enlightening."
1,Anti Microsoft book of the year award,"This is the most biased book that I have ever read. Not only it predict Microsoft has only 5 years left to live, it also attack Bill Gates' Business at the Speed of Thought. The entire book is comparing Microsoft and Oracle Products, and conclude that Oracle is heading everything right, but Mircosoft software is going to die. Fun reading and amusing but I could not agree with many of the assumption stated in the book. But, it is not worth buying. Worth just a browse in the library or book shop. Running small medium business, I choose Microsoft Access over Oracle gaint database. Access is much user friendly, easily to program using Visual Basic, easily available. Oracle product is solely for ""big"" organization, very not user friendly and very expensive to use for a medium business. Larry, Microsoft is he re to stay, and is eating into your lunch bit by bit...hehe"
2,A Gay Fantasy Come True,"I met Harvey when he would come to L.A. for the annual parade in June. He was not a swish, like Sean Penn plays him. Sean Penn is a limousine liberal who was raised in Malibu, California. He hung out with Charlie Sheen, a master of self restraint. Helen Keller knows more about gay people than Sean Penn; he should stick to travelling out of the country so he can stick his ignorant nose into international politics.There's a reason this movie is selling brand new on Amazon for five bucks and change, sales must be poor. You can say you don't like this review or call me any politically correct names you want, but it won't change the truth."
5,sad and wonderful story,this movie tells a true story of what happened in the 1970's. its sad but true and marked a great movement in america's history. i think every one should see this at lease once in there life.
5,Truth Will Out,"When an openly gay man runs for public office and is accpeted by the voters, his success is guaranteed. Based on a true story, Harvey Milk shows himself to be a true friend of the people and a staunch defender of equal rights. His desire to be the people's representative in a major political position creates a dilemma in this most intolerant of times in our country and makes his journey truly remarkable. His life changed history."
4,Thought provoking,"I liked the movie because it showed me a point of view, I had not understood. The high rate of suicide among homosexuals is disturbing. Homophobia is a crime against humanity, but the issue of how to assimilating homosexuality ""outside the closet"", is complicated. I've have mixed feelings on the subject. Honestly, parts of the movie aroused emotions of empathy and some repulsion. I respect the movie for it's honesty."
2,Not Really That Good,"Outside of Sean Penn's acting this was an average movie at best. It seems we have a lot of people rating the subject matter and their own political desires rather than the movie itself. It just plain was neither that good nor entertaining. If you want the story read the actual history, this was a movie playing on Hollywood morals which would guarantee it a nod for an Oscar regardless of quality. My 2 cents."
5,Purchase of two direct tv remotes,"Both were new, great condition, and with the directions to set them up.Very happy with this transaction. My best so far !!!!!!"
2,"Penn great, movie not quite...","I came into the film knowing absolutely nothing about Harvey Milk. Penn is as good as everyone has said; most of the time, due to his acting, I felt like I was watching a documentary. Unfortunately, a documentary would probably be more interesting than the film. It draaaaagged in spots and was mostly just unremarkable. Giving away the ending up front didn't make any sense, and while the building of the movement was fun and interesting in spots, a bit more attention to the assassination would have been nice (or at least have it played for shock). Some bits were fun, some bits were informative (e.g. the actual footage of gay bars around the U.S. being raided was pretty interesting), some touching...but mostly it's not something I'd recommend. I think they should have cut some of his relationships out for example, I don't know, just get it a bit more brisk would be nice."
3,Was blu ray version worth the extra cost?,"I loved the movie, but didn't think that the blu-ray version was worth the extra cost."
2,It was such a disappointment,"I was expecting much more from this movie as well as Penn, and Franco,i believe Penn is one of the best actors out there, but this movie wasnot up to my expectations at all, the overall acting was poor, the plotwas weak, the direction was lame. Im not saying its not worth watching,i'm just saying don't have high hopes on it. Highly overrated!! WatchJFK or Bobby instead!"
4,Interesting and Well Done,I thought this was a very good movie. I like the way it was shot. Sometimes it almost had a documentary type feel to it. All the actors were excellent and it was a very interesting story that I knew very little about.
3,"Milk DVD,","Length:: 1:35 MinsI purchased this milk sometime in June. When I say the ""Outside packaging"" I'm talking about the plastic thats wrapped around DVDs when you buy them. I have no idea how the cartridge was messed up but not the packaging?? But all and all the DVD plays well, had there been damage to the DVD I would have sent it back.I hope this helps! :)"
1,Save up for a better Spa.,"I've had this spa for about a year now and have had to replace the pump / heater 3 times. The spa itself looks nice, especially if you get a proper cover for it but the aggravation of having to replace the pump every few months is very annoying. I'm throwing mine out next week.This spa is cheap for reason -- it's very cheaply made."
5,after i was able to get cs rep on phone item was repaired.,"Length:: 1:12 Minsdont buy from day one i only had 50% jets. the heating is getting weaker and the jets have quit all together all it makes is a click sound when you press the jets start buttion. here is a video while i was setting it up and filling it. as you can see only 50% of the jets are working out of the box. the maker will not fix or replace saying u need to do this that and this. they give you the run around with thing to do that never work. hoping you will not call back then they make up some more thing to do until you runs your warranty out. This whole ordeal is a scam i was taken for $1,266.99 they took me for a ride in the process of disputing it with my visa credit card company. don't buy you will be buying trash! it never worked 100% out of the box. after a long talk to customer service i was able to get this unit working in 100% working order and i will now give it a 5 stars."
1,Didn't read all my mp3 cd's and not very good sound,"I bought this mp3 boombox for work so that I don't have to have to keep changing cd's and 1 cd would get me through the whole day. Well this was the first one I saw, and I didn't think $50 was that bad, so I got it.At first it worked good. I noticed right away, that sound quality wasn't that great and it didn't play very loud at all. Then it wouldn't play some of my mp3 cd's. It would say ""no mp3"". I took it back and got the RCA RCD125 and for $20 more it's much much better. It played the cd that this one wouldn't.I'd stay away from this one."
3,Yep - it's missing something,It's missing an auxiliary audio input for things like a DVD or VCR player. Without this - no need for me to buy it. Otherwise it looked nice in the store.
1,Very Bad Player,This is an extreamly bad player. Expect it to have a disk error on half of your home burned DVD's and one in 10 professionaly burned discs.
2,two stars is being nice.,"It wasn't as impactful as I thought it would be. Some of the people that gave comments gave some great comments and others, well, other gave comments. The selection of people was a good cross section but it didn't have meaning to it. I was looking for more in depth commentary. Maybe what I was looking for should have been said between each of the comments in the book. It might have looked like hugh just collected a bunch of email and old letters and thrown them together."
1,Horrible,"I found this to be the worst machine ever. Bought one plugged it in and nothing. I called Philips and they said it was faulty to return it. Got another one and it had lines through the picture and just quit about a month later. Philips wants to send a &quot;like new or refurbished model of equal or lesser value&quot;. How ridiculous!! It never worked right from the beginning and if I want Philips to fix it, then I have to pay an exchange fee and also shipping. Not worth it. I will never buy Philips again."
1,Better alternatives available,"I bought one of these but had to return it since it would freeze up and/or stutter while playing the second layer (about an hour or so in) on most of my DVD's. The player seems cheaply made and the features are not that great. The remote, in particular, is very flimsy, with tiny buttons that you can't read in a dimmed room. Afer returning this, I got a JVC XV-S500BK for about the same price and I'm much happier with it."
1,Piece of junk!,"This DVD player skips badly, even for new DVDs. And at about 9 months the video output has stopped working. Don't but this piece of junk."
1,No output jacks no decoder,"I couldn't even use this thing because IT DOES NOT HAVE A DOLBY DIGITAL DECODER BUILT IN...don't believe the hype! Philips couldn't even begin to give me support on this issue, because their staff consists of complete idiots."
5,Continuation of Black Feminist Thought,"Patricia Hill Collins builds off of her equally enlightening and well-written Black Feminist Thought to create fighting words. She proposes a ""critical social theory"" to combine both theory and action for black feminism, stressing that thought is useless without these actions. She analyzes the need for such a theory as well as the reasons for black feminism's unique ability to serve as that theory. Using sociology, postmodernism, and Afrocentrism as her examples, Collins examines the history of black women within the areas and how her critical social theory could impact them. The overall point of such critical social theory is to achieve empowerment for black women, and Collins ties everything together into her vision of how that is possible. An excellent book, though anyone who wants a complete picture should also read her Black Feminist Thought."
3,Being Sold on Amazon UK--not a Bootleg!,Another reviewer claimed this is a bootleg. Not so. Is being sold on Amazon UK along the with the Six Million Dollar Man. All you need is a region-free DVD player and you're all set!
4,Evidence to make the case: Islam is not all about peace,"Robert Spencer assembles in lawyer-like fashion evidence (there is so much of it that in places it seems like repetition) from the Koran (and other Muslim publications) and from Islamic history -- to make the case that there is, even today, real power (the Bible does not have the same kind of power today) in these ancient writings -- and these Holy Words are a source violence. The actions of the West are not the main cause of the problem.Without pressure from the outside the essence of the Koran (found at the end part of the Koran, according to the author) would still call on Muslims to strive for Islamic expansion. And force is justified in the many different kinds of situations."
5,Fun Fun Fun,"Our daughter spends many hours reading and re-reading this book and interacting with Blue. It comes out for reading especially when Blue's on tv and she points at the book and tv and has really developed her learning and memory retention and recollection. The whole Blue's videos and books are a must and in association with parental teaching your child will improve greatly. Where was Blue many years ago for our other children. One of the best learning shows around. Our daughter is two years old and now has a great imagination and play skills, which, thanks to Blue and Steve, is improving each and everyday of Blues Clues. Buy this book, plenty of fun for your kids."
3,Serial Murder,"Nora Chancel is having a bad week. There's a serial murderer loose in town. She finds out her husband has recently had an affair with one of the ""victims"". When the woman turns up, she blames Nora for kidnapping and torturing her. At the police station, the murderer takes her hostage and they are on the run ""together"". How much worse can it get? Recent events seem to be somehow tied to events back in 1938 at a writer's retreat. Nora is determined to find the link."
5,"UTTERLY, UTTERLY ADDICTIVE","Straubs' latest book leapfogs over any other book published by his dear friend, the increadibly over rated Stephen King.Dick Dart, is a most orginal character in a twisted, sick, psychopathic way.Great twists, even better character possesing evil sins and shadowy pasts.""This world is populated by ingrates, morons, assholes and those beneath them."" So true.Straubs' finest to date. Brav"
2,"If you like Ghost Story, you won't like this.","I read Ghost Story and Shadowlands years ago, and picked this up recently. While it has interesting characters and is well-written, I guess I was looking for something a little more exciting. I didn't find the psychopathic bad guy very frightening at all, and the book-cover hype about psychological duels between him and the protagonist lasted about 1/5 of the book. Couldn't hold me, didn't even finish it."
1,"Good technique, but lacking everything else.","I can tell from this book that the author is talented at weaving a tale, but this book was just terrible. Good technique cannot save this story.None of the characters in the book are well-developed. The author did not create any attachment to the main character, which is a fatal blunder.Most of The Hellfire Club is filler. There is too much detail, and too many parts that could have been left out without affecting the plot. The only salvageable parts of this book are the parts with the villain. This novel is 463 pages long, yet it easily could have been around 200 pages.After reading The Hellfire Club, I was left scratching my head. It is not scary nor suspenseful. The book is simply boring. I had much difficulty finishing this book, and I admit I had to speed-read through at least 150 pages.I'm very glad I did not purchase this book, and I recommend that you do not waste your time with it."
4,"not a desert islander, but worth multiple listens","Some reviews of this are correct when they say there aren't any mind-blowing solos (though Rice does let loose a little in ""Sam-Bino""). The music is indeed sweet, though. What's most interesting for me, though, is the clear differences in sound. I'm not much of a mandolin fan, so I can't tell an enormous difference there. The guitars, though, are almost shockingly different in their tones. With the extensive liner notes, it all adds up to a great CD."
4,Coral Fang: a definite MUST BUY!!!,"This is the 3rd album from The Distillers, and though its not quite as hardcore as Sing Sing Death house, it still delivers Brody Dalle's signature amazing lyrics, strong vocals that will blow you away, and crazy guitar licks, including a new guitarist on board. Coral Fang is a definite must buy. Just make sure you know there is two versions to the front cover; I wasn't paying attention, and I bought the less graphic one... its all good though. Peace."
1,What the heck happened???!!?!?!,"I decided to wait a little before I put in this review, listen to the cd a couple of more times, maybe the songs might stick. But they didn't! I only liked 2 songs on this cd. I don't know what happened but on this cd, Brody's voice sounds so bad and they don't sound like the Distillers anymore! If you like SSDH DON""T BUY THIS CD!!!"
3,meh,"yes the distillers are very kick ass, but on a lot of these tracks it almost sounds as if brody is bored and they put the tracks on just to finish the album off. to each there own opinion, but sing sing death house and the self-titled are by far better choices..."
4,AND THEY RETURN FOR A 3RD CD,"i have listened to this cd many times trying to make up my mind if i like it or not. Once you get past the point that this cd doesnt sound like the first two you'll be fine, and maybe even love it. New guitarist makes a big difference but in the end it all sounds great. Brody Dalle's (yes, her divorce is final) voice has never sounded better. so this cd gets my 4 starsGOOD JOB"
3,New Style,"If you like the original Distillers from 3 years ago, you won't like this. They still have a good sound, but it's not what they used to be."
5,Awesome,"This Album is awesome The Distillers put out another great one!...the only difference is, what happened to the punk?....but thats ok!"
5,distillers' new album coral fang is great,i really like the distillers new cd it is really great if you're looking for a great album and your a punk or a fan of punk rock younshould go out and buy the distillers new cd coral fang
3,It's starting to slow down.........,I'm a big fan of the Pendragon series. Currently I'm on book 9. I loved the series till book 7. It's becoming impossible to keep straight in my head. The story is getting slower the farther you go. There's so many characters that are Saint Dane. This book was a disappointment.
5,Love this movie!!!!,"Jack Wagner at his devious best!! Great thriller, with a surprise ending.Buy it, watch it, enjoy it!!"
1,Worked for a while,"I bought this TV thinking I received a good deal. The TV worked really well for 10 months. Then the TV died, it wouldn't turn on at all. Memorex was no help! When I contacted Memorex, (the TV only has a 6 month warranty) they only offered me the name of a service center 5 hours away that would pay for parts and not labor. (I can buy a new TV cheaper!). I recommend spending the extra money and buying a SONY!"
3,A good bargaining...,"Well, for almost the price of one CD you can get the two best Grim Reaper albums (they recorded only three), and since ""ROCK YOU TO HELL"" is no big deal, you will possess everything tha matters from this band in a single CD. A good deal.Although Grim Reaper has a muscular and visceral sound, and its guitarrist and founding member Nick Bowcott is a talented axe man, you can not be fooled by all the five stars reviews here. Nostalgy is a strong influence over people's tastes... In these days of fabricated and talentless ""artists"" like Beyonce, Backstreet Boys, Spice Girl, Britney Spears, anything from the past that has a solid rocking performance tend to be viewed like a mega banda. Grim Reaper was a very competent band, buch too much limited in their own style. That's why they succumbed."
3,A little disappointed...,"I was very pleased with the 75 liter bag I purchased, so I went after this one with very little inquiry. I was disappointed to find that this bag has no outside pockets, and the shoulder straps have no torso adjustment. It's just a bag with shoulder straps. If that's all you need this will be fine, just be sure you know what you're buying before you purchase(unlike me...)."
3,Aggravating,The Summit 45 would be the perfect overnight pack if the sternum and shoulder straps would stop slipping. Every time I would reach my arm out to stabilize myself when scrambling over rocks the straps would zip out and throw you off balance especially if you were not prepared for the sudden shift in weight. If this happened once or twice it would not be a big deal but if you are hiking 9-10 hours a day you don't want to be adjusting your straps every 15 minutes. It is always the small things that create an annoyance. If you have a medium or small frame this could be the pack for you. It is well constructed although the front pocket is near useless if the main body is stuffed full with gear and food.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I intended to burn MP3 CDs on my computer and play them in this Mini-CD player while I exercise. This player DOES NOT PLAY MP3 CDs! It recognized the tracks on the screen, but as I skipped through the tracks, it only would play the last track on the CD. By the way, I had NO problem playing the same MP3 CD on my Sony DVD Player, model DVP-NS575P! Amazon cheerfully sent me another unit within a few days. As soon as I put batteries in it and turned it on, I found out the display did not work, right out of the box. I finally requested a refund."
5,Product is great!,"I ordered the Memorex Pocket CD player to carry while walking/jogging. I knew it only used the Pocket CD's. That is exactly what I wanted. I do not understand why the retailers do not carry this product in stores.I convert my CD's to MP3 files on my computer and burn to Pocket CD on my ancient HP 7200 CD burner. No problems.I assume the pause between tracks is the ESP working. It doesn't sound good for albums such as ""Abbey Road"" by The Beatles, which goes straight from one track to the other. Otherwise, who cares.I just use this product when jogging/walking anyway.Heck of a lot cheaper than iPod or similar products. I don't know why the pocket cd's are not more popular."
1,A player with one annoying flaw.....,"I bought this player at a local electronics store. It has the features I want (small size, nice display, ability to handle CD-RWs, good battery life) at a reasonable price. The problem is that I hear a slight click or pop in the phones at the end of *every* track. You might or might not notice it while walking on a busy street but it's quite obvious in a quiet room. I exchanged the player, but the second unit has exactly the same problem."
1,Serious display problems,"I'm piping in to confirm that the displays are a serious problem. I have received two from Amazon and neither had working displays when I started them up. Its great that this player has id3 tag support, but the fact that the display doesn't work makes this feature somewhat moot."
1,Dazzle Video Creator Platinum,"Would not work with Vista, even with their download patch and with their instruction on how to set everything up....Its a piece of junk, could not recommend it forl a computer with Vista."
2,Beware!,I was unable to install the software on two brand new machines runningVISTA. Is NOT Vista compatible.
1,Dazzle,The software isn't worth anything and Pinnacle won't respond to any form of contact. Worthless
1,Don't buy Dazzle or Pinnacle,Unstable software. Zero customer service. Conversion from 8MM to Digital is grainy and almost unwatchable.
3,Fleece throw,"This was not what I expected. I thought it would be a soft, plush fleece and it was not. It was more like a blanket feet than a plush throw."
2,Do Not Buy 793CH - Very Slow and Doesn't Play All DVD's,"I bought Philips 793CH thinking that Philips has a great reputation in making great DVD & CD players, but i got really disappointed as my player most of time doesn't read discs. Sometimes it reads the disk and sometimes it rejects the same disk when entered later. Most of the time i get the display saying ""disk error"". IT doesn't give the folder names for the MP3 files so you have to look for a perticular song in the list of 150 songs and its doesn't even display the full title of the song as it is limited to less character space only. Although this player has all the fancy outputs including 'component video output', 's-video output', and has optical in and they work great but the bottom line for this player is ""ITS NOT WORTH IT""I still don't have any probs with Philips as a brand cause other DVD players of Philips kicks ass! they just play anything! But this one is a loser!"
5,Finally,"After looking for it so long, I finally own it. The self titled debut of Ghost Machine is a great album, a look into what you could expect on their follow up ""Hypersensitive"". I owned ""Hypersensitive"" before I purchased this, and although some of the same songs are on here I'm a big collector. It's very dark music with real well thought out subject matter. My only hope is that they will make a 3rd album."
1,Waste of money.,"Bought this because I wanted to do some two piece molds for wargaming. Opened it and had immediate buyers regret. You still have to shell out the cash for extras not included. Found another mold making ""starter"" kit offered by a hobby site called micro-mark that gives you EVERYTHING for $40 more. Kleen Klay, mixing cups, resin, etc etc. After seeing micro-mark's offering, I'd hardly call this a ""starter kit""."
3,"Good Alarm, Bad Shaker",I found this alarm to be good for light sleepers but not for heavy sleepers like myself because the alarm only shakes for 1 minute instead of nonstop or until I get out of bed.
1,Don't bother,"It's a nice first effort and I don't blame Delaney as much as his editors. The thing is, the book sucked. The characters were one dimensional and confusing - at one point, during a flashback, the names of the characters are changed without explanation and then the people in the flashback start using the names of present-time people. At another point, a character who has a sucking chest wound is sent running down a hall. He could have asked any ambulance driver - they can't do that.Maybe it's hard to write without an outline, this book was certainly hard to read with the typos and mistakes.So...when Mr. Delaney either learns to write better characters, or gets better editors, he'll be worth it. This book isn't worth the time."
3,The Editor's Day Off,"One of the great pleasures of reading a good book is to forget that you are actually reading. Not so with Jinn.Jinn is a humans vs. a consistent, not-too-human opponent throughout most of the book, that is until the end chapters. Suddenly the opponent is a ""shape-shifter"" that while still in possesion of certain ""powers"" is now something entirely different.There were many delicious ways that this book could have gone, but the road this book took was the one titled, ""Dead End"".The editing was horrific. For example a character takes a final drag off his cigarette, grinds it out under his shoe, and in the next paragraph takes another drag off his cigarette! As the book drags to the rediculous finale, you will find that this book is full of these grammatical speed bumps.All in all a confusing, poorly edited book that either should have ended 60 pages earlier, or tacked on 6 extra pages of explanations. A REAL TIME WASTER."
2,"Nice start, but...","This novel starts well, with WWII combat descriptions that suggest a good read ahead. Unfortunately, the plot becomes a convulted combination of Predator, Body Snatchers, and reincarnation. Characters are all stereotypes. The writing also weakens as the book continues; a lot of ""Suddenly it happened"" one-sentence paragraphs, always a bad sign. Very disappointing after an interesting opening."
2,Skip this One,"With all due respect to the reviewers that have given ""Jinn"" 4-and-5 star ratings, and at the risk of alienating this fan club, I'm sorry, but I just didn't enjoy this book. The initial premise was interesting, but the execution has an overall `sloppy"" feel to it. From the atrocious editing to lazy character development to factual inaccuracies, it seems that this was hastily and carelessly concieved. But mostly what bothered me was the sense of ""been there-done that""...I found the characters two-dimensional and cartoonish, the dialogue flat and uninspiring. The plot, even in spite of the annoying typographic errors, is convoluted and clumsy, and overly long..."
5,Give it a Shot!,"this was one of the wildest stories i've read in a while. has a little bit of everything,pulling from a whole variety of genres and some parts are really, seriously, scary. i could see delaney moving in a number of different direction in his next books...and yes, i hope he gets better editing. the characters are a little thin, but the plot and writing style more than makes up for this. some scenes are vaguely familiar, but others are quite original and the book as a whole could almost be a screenplay in itself. very cinematic read and worth a look, if you have a strong stomach."
4,Top notch pulp fiction!,"I friend loaned me his copy and I liked it so much I'm buying one for myself. ""Jinn"" rivals Harry Shannon's wickedly outrageous 2002 romp ""Night of the Beast"" as a slice of pure pulp fiction, the kind of stuff people don't seem to write any more. Very fast paced, far-fetched and daringly odd. Really a good one, and Delaney deserves all the success he can get just for being so darned determined to entertain us. Good for him!"
2,Not worth the price,The book was not anything different than what is published on true crime web sites. Don't pay for it..Not worth the list price.
3,Not as good as I was made to believe,"On Wednesday, April 11, 2007 I wrote about this book:Not near as good as those 7 reviewers stated on amazon.I bought this book because of the good reviews. 4.5 stars but to be honest, I was disappointed.Now I am wondering about the amazon system. I know people who write reviews ask their friends to vote for them, stating that their review is helpful.This sucks, because lots of people like me refer to the reviews out there when they buy a book.I bought this one new because of it.Maybe not nice to say but it got very boring.Very repetitive, when you complete this book you still don't have a clue about the killer, how he murdered the girls, what happened to him after he got caught. Why he did what he did.6.5 out of 10Definitely not worth 4.5 stars. yes his writing is not bad, but I can't say I was enjoying this read."
3,movie,This movie was purchased as a xmas present so i have not viewed it but it appears to be in great shape. thank you.
4,That good feeling,"When I first heard this album I got a good feeling inside, becuase there is only positivity in there lyrics and it shows you the love they havve for the Lord. It has a laid back style it is real mellow. It is worth checking it out, you will be suprised at how good they sound. Peace&God bless"
5,I love thismat!,"This is a great mat. It is thicker and more cushy than a typical yoga mat, which makes it great for using outside or on a hard surface. It has held up well--for nearly a year I have used it 4-5 times per week and it still looks new. And, I even bought one for a friend as a gift!"
3,Not Good For Intense Workouts,"I bought this yoga mat because I needed one to do floor exercises for my workout dvds. I read the reviews on multiple mats, before finally settling on this one. After using this mat multiple times, I realized that it does not fit my purpose. I work-out in my bedroom, which is carpeted. I wanted something to provide some extra cushioning, which this mat definitely does. However, whenever I am working out and start to sweat, it's almost pointless to try to do anything on the mat. If I try to do leg raises, my body starts slipping down the mat. The same goes for push-ups and planks. My hands start to slip. The only way to prevent from slipping is to put down a towel to provide some traction. This mat is good if you need some extra cushioning and are doing less rigorous workouts. Other than that, I wouldn't buy it."
4,Merritt at his finest,"This novel sags in the middle with what appears to be padded material to lengthen it out, but the beginning and ending chapters are breathtaking fantasy in a beautiful style. Merritt was a genius and one should simply ignore the padding and enjoy the brilliant parts."
4,Truly not for kids only,Worth owning for the wonderful version of Shenandoah. This version will make you cry. A great CD.
5,Bluegrass and folk for all ages,"This music has that timeless folky appeal. The title is appropriate, as I can understand children enjoying the simplicity of these songs, but the songs themselves aren't ""childish."" They speak about simple subject matter (eg. trains) but in a respectful and authoritative way. Master musicianship as well."
5,Incredible Traditional Bluegrass,"This album is not just a bunch of hippies playing around with a different style of music. This is pure, traditional Bluegrass that rivals anything put out by Monroe or Lester and Earl."
5,Inspirational,"This book although sad at times was inspirational as well as motivational. The lead character Grace appears to have it all a loving husband,good job great kids. And then one phone call to her husband sends their neat life spiraling out of control. Grace handles everything better than most women would have with the help from God and her husband. Grace is a woman although fictional who seems to have reached self actualization(Maslow)at a very early age. I pray that when probems arise in my life I can also handle them like Grace. The only thing I didn't care for in this book is how Starlight is depicted because I truly believe she was trying to motivate people even though she was getting paid for it. Overall this was an excellent read for the young and old. It brings up deep emotional topics."
4,"What's done in the dark, comes to the light","Like always, Victoria seems to bring marriages through tough situations but in the end, God gets the glory. This was a story of a man having an affair before he became a christian. Once he learned years later that he bared a son during his affair; the truth had to be told to his wife in order to live a normal life."
1,"Buyer Beware, horrid cd in sight","IMPOSTORS 'singing' only 2 Four Tops songs. There's not a single positive point for this cd. Stay away from it at any cost.What's more, the music included is terrible and boring.AND THEY ARE NOT THE REAL GROUP !I would have given less than one star if I could. On a scale from 0 to 20, I'm not sure if this cd would deserve as musch as 0,5"
4,A highly enjoyable read,"I give the highest of marks to Caroline Leavitt for creating characters I truly cared about. Molly, Gary, Suzanne and Baby Otis were people I actually was concerned for, and needed to know what the outcomes in their lives were. This is a touching story that is not as sickly sweet as you may think, these people are far from perfect and certainly possess as many weaknesses as strenghts. I had a few minor problems with this novel (there were some glaring typos for example), and some of the big issue problems like the financial crisis seemed to be forgotten by the end of the novel, but these are again minor and in no way affect the overall worthiness of the story. It is easy to lose yourself in the lives of these characters for a few hours, it would make for a fine summer read."
5,"This was a really, really good book","I thought that this story was completely believabable, after all, strange and terrible things often do happen to people. And people can and do change as a result. I read this book straight through, and think that Ms. Leavitt is a wonderful writer. Definitely read this book - you'll go from tears to joy."
1,Extremely disappointing,"Although this book has a good premise, it does not live up to its potential. Only the main character, Gary, is a complete person. The plot is thick, plodding through arcane medical conditions and definitions and tangential descriptions. Most disappointing, though, was the neat and tidy final section. If these characters had faced a situation this difficult, they could not possibly resolve all of their issues within days of each other. (And, to end with a nitpick, the large financial problem is completely glossed over, after having been a major plot point throughout the work.) This was sad, dull, and unsatisfying."
1,Arrived already expired!,"It claims to have a 5 years shelf life, but the expiration date on the packaged was 06/10... disappointed."
1,Pure Nutrition,"I'm sure this stuff will keep you alive. As for taste, however, it is like a biscuit made with three times the fat and then soaked in oil. If I had been able to finish the one block I tried, I don't think it would have stayed down. If rationing your food is the point... well done Mainstay!"
5,anyone entering college NEEDS this book,"I totally recommend this book for anyone entering college, there are so many scholarships out there that several of us are not even aware of that we qualify for that our children can go to college without a financial strain on the family. the money spent on this book you will make back by not having to spend it on their education."
2,excel for standard planning,"I bought this book hoping to learn something new and advanced but found myself redaing things that are simple to impliment in excel.There examples are on a very basic level , the templates that are supplied are for understandning the basics and no more then that.Over all, I was very dissapointed. This book is for for beginers in excel who want to upgrade their thinking and planning to beginner plus level."
2,"I like Hanson, but this books sucks!","The only reason why I gave this story 2 stars is because of the cover, which is the ONLY decent picture in the whole book. The information is incorrect, the questions are stupid, and the book does not contain anything we, as fans, don't already know. Don't bother buying this book, it's a waste of your bucks. You'd be better off just listening to the album."
5,49er Tie,This tie is tastefully done in 49er motiff. My dad the 49er fan loved it and wears it to work as a an administrator in a school. Everyone notices it and knows he is a 49er fan!
5,oscar oscar oscar,"i have been a big fan of Django Reinhardt since 1953...i can still get chills listening to certain tracks....but findingOscar Aleman was such a suprise...he doesn't send chills downmy spine, but he does keep my interest.....really well.something else i have noticed...there is a great radiostation on the net ""Hot Club Radio"" on the Live 365 net;and of all the Gypsy guitarists: Oscar Aleman is right inthere with all the other Gypsy/European guitarists...so those of you new to Oscar; give him a listen.john m."
3,Not bad for the first couple years. Core foam wears out somewhat fast.,"We're not super disenfranchised with this mattress. It has been good to us for the most part. We purchased in 2008. Within 2 years the core foam begins to wear out. At this point you can squeeze it flat with merely the weight of a baby. On the other hand, the memory foam is top quality all the way and acts the way today it did upon purchasing. If you are looking for a memory foam bed this one is certainly worth a look although the Memory Foam on one side and natural latex on the other would be my first choice. We've not found a reasonable source to replace the foam core pieces yet but we added a couple of thin cheap twin mattresses to the bottom and that helped quite a bit to soften the blow until we can."
4,Very good minimal techno from Japan.,"This CD is worth it just for the amazing tribal track ""Polynasia"" (which also has a killer video which can be found on Denki Groove's ""Nomo Video"" video/DVD). Takkyu Ishino's Denki Groove CDs are generally more wacky and more fun, but for straightforward beats this is pretty killer."
2,"Having this is better than not having coffee, but...","This coffee pot just isn't very durable. The basket and the stem flex very easily, the plastic knob on top always wants to fall out, the cover's attachment to the pot is flimsy. Mine hasn't broken yet, but I just don't see it lasting very long. Do yourself a favor, spend a bit more money and get something that is built better. Coffee is too important to risk it on this. :)"
1,cheaply made...beware!,"this arrived loose in a box with no instructions and had a big chip at the bottom. it was very light and not rugged or sturdy at all. i was thinking this would do...until i opened it up and saw the inside components. this thing would bend under the weight of a heavy stare. flimsy comes to mind...not to mention that the lid to the grounds cup was missing. the plastic globe at the top barely fit and would easily come out. i returned this and purchased the Farberware Yosemite percolator which is stainless steel and cheaper!!!!!okay...i received my Farberware Yosemite percolator and it is awesome, sturdy and nice looking. it worked perfectly on the stove, came in it's own box with instructions when the more expensive cheaply made GSI didn't! i will never waste my time on a GSI product ever again. go with the Yosemite...you will love it.Farberware 50124 Classic Yosemite Stainless Steel Percolator"
4,Camping gear.,Have to be careful not to fill it too far or it will boil over.Should have gotten a larger size so that wouldn't have beenan issue.
4,Coffee pot review,"I really love this coffee pot, it is exactly what I was looking for. However there are some things that you need to consider; first off the top piece is plastic which is fine but it does shrink a little, so it does fall off when you open the top for cleaning. I grew up with percolators and my mother would always use a shot glass cause they would always fall out and break cause they were glass.The other thing is the basket is made out of Aluminum which would be fine except the bottom is very thin and easily bent while cleaning, so only rinse.I intend to find a stainless steel one at a garage sale and then it will be perfect."
3,Moderately impressive,"Praiseworthy, to a small extent, for art-metal ambitions alone...payoff does come, but getting there can be a self-indulgent slag in the guise of epic."
1,Look for an earlier version.,"The Hong Kong releases of this movie are under the title ""The Tai-Chi Master"" and are universally better than this release. This was a wonderful movie before it was shrunk and dubbed. Disney seems doing this to all of the Hong Kong movies it can buy. Not only are they presented in a shortened version, they are not so much translated as rewritten. While I love these movies they just can't survive being dumbed down. It takes them from the sublimely ridiculous to the annoyingly stupid. Avoid any and all of these releases. The originals are well worth the trouble of digging up."
5,JET LI AND MICHELLE YEOH!,"Now I'm giving this movie 5 stars because I love Jet, Michelle and Woo ping. Now if you don't like string work you probably won't enjoy this. If you want more realistic but fast fighting, then for Jet I would definitley recommend Fist of Legend, and for Michelle Yeoh check out Wing Chun. Both of the films were also coordinated by Woo Ping."
5,"Jet Li's, Michelle Yeoh and Yuen Woo-ping Best Film!!!!!!",This movie is the best Jet Li movie of all time. The rating tells it all. The Fighting scenes were magnificant. There was the coolest fight scenes with weapons and some of the best scenarios for fighting. My heart was racing and I studdered in disbelieve at the action choreography. It truly was astounding. The insight about Tai-chi is also accurate and the wirework is fabulous. Fist of Legend was my favortie movie until this movie came along with all the fighting. Michelle Yeoh was amazing as wel with her use of a machete and her fighting techniques. All the fight scenes were new to me and didn't disappoint. This is the greatest movie I have ever seen.
4,just a remaster not a new movie,"This movie exists in another form the movie was orginally named ""Twin Warriors"" i have that movie really great movie about if you are interested in learning about what Tai-Chi is about, along with the fights. i will be getting this movie and watch see if it stands up to the orignal"
4,Hilarious,"I bought this book not knowing what to expect and I was very surprised. Within minutes I was laughing my head off and my family thought I was going crazy, highly recommended."
3,"Good, but VERY different from ""old"" Seatle","This book gives a fairly good overview of the Seatle area, as it exists is 2060 - the setting of Shadowrun 3rd edition. I say overview, because this book does not contain standard format location descriptions like previous ""place"" books. Instead it has general neighborhood overviews. So it's not a replacement for old seatle - in reality it serves a totally different purpose. I give it the 3 stars it got because it's the only campaign setting currently available for shadowrun, so new GM's pretty much need it. However, if you can get your hands on old Seatle (via ebay perhaps) it's quite worth your while. Like all 3rd edition books, it lacks ""black"" comentary, so it lacks a lot in the flavor department. If your looking for flavor, find a used copy of Germany ;)"
3,A Nice Update and alot of good info for your campaigns,"If most of your campaigns are played in Seattle, this is a must see book. It has updates on all the info that was in the old Seattle Sorcebook."
5,Truly a Treasure,"Trust the dependable old Dawg himself, David Grisman, to deliver the goods when it comes to honest-to-goodness acoustic music. Tone Poems II accomplishes precisely what it sets out to do, to present ""the sounds of the great jazz guitars, mandolins, mandolas, and mandocellos."" There is good pickin' aplenty by Grisman and Taylor on a variety of well-known tunes, but not one note of this set sounds rote or routine. With an informative booklet featuring pictures and histories of some beautiful instruments, Tone Poems II is truly a treasure."
3,Comfortable but does not inflate very much.,"I purchased this for my Father who was bedridden and wanted to be able to ""fluff"" his own pillow. He was always having to ask that his pillows be switched around since he was unable to do so himself and he wanted more control over his bed situation. He did say it was comfortable but it didn't do the job with inflating and deflating like he had wanted. If you are looking for something that can go from a soft pillow to a firm pillow then I do not recommend this product as it is still very firm when fully deflated and really not much difference when fully inflated."
5,super practical and handy,"These are kept in my kitchen drawer and used multiple times daily for just about everything except what their name implies. I think you could even use them to cut up a chicken if you do your own handling. I use them for everything else: opening packages from the mail, packages of salad greens or whatever else from the groc store, cutting the edge off my dog's fish oil capsules so I can pour it onto her food, cutting tags off clothing, etc, etc, you get the idea. I bought them to replace a pair that was inadvertently given to me like ten years ago. I must've accidentally knocked them into the trash and immediately felt ""lost"" without them, so I am happy to have a replacement. : )"
5,casual,"If your a casual fan of STP and know them by their hit songs this cd is perfect for you. But if you're serious you'd probably collect the cd's one by one. I love Sour Girl, anyway I don't know why these songs got airplay they're actually pretty good, the radio stations in my town only play crap."
4,"great rock, a bit more upbeat than Alice in Chains","great rock, a bit more upbeat than Alice in Chains, this album has a little bit of everything for the hard rock fan, hardly a bad tune in the whole album"
4,buy the cd/dvd version only1 it rocks,"The ranting lunatic that put out that last review should have spent more time debasing spears or some other taletless band. I must admit a lot of the stuff from core is a little played out for me, seeing atlanta live, and the video for hello, It's late! really have a beautiful ring though! Their progressiveness however unpopular to some has really made me appreciate them even more!Every band must have 1 greatest hits but to have a little extra and a dvd makes this one worth the money! Definetly five star material if its all new to u and u dig it! i gave it 4 because all the magic lies in the dvd and the new song, but i own all the albums so the cd isn't much to me! Buy this one! for realit is a gem."
5,We love our Bunn-O-Matic,"I purchased this for our veterinary hospital. I and others were spending lots of money at area coffee shops and I thought we could save money, gas and time if we had our own coffee maker. We love it. We also use it for when we have meetings and seminars at our place of business. I would recommend it highly! Very easy to use. Now the cofee shop experience is a present to myself on days where I can use a brief ""vacation""."
3,Bunn Coffee Pot,"I love the Bunn products! I even have a Bunn coffee pot in my house!This coffee pot has a couple small things I do not care for.#1 The lid where you pour water into leaks water onto top of machine every time it's opened.Poor design! It should be twice as big so you don't pour water every where also.#2 There is a 30 second delay before coffee begins to come thru filter. I've never seen this before, usually it's instantaneous. Some people end up pouring more water in & then you have a mess!Other than those things, it's a great machine."
4,I liked this memoir,Reading this memoir I was very interested in Schilling Manor and how it was it's own little world for the wives and children of service men during the Vietnam war.
4,Fascinating True Story of Military Families During the Vietnam War,"Author Donna Moreau has written a fascinating account of a decommissioned Air Force base that became government housing for military families with a family member off fighting in Vietnam. Reading the book brought back those years during the Vietnam War, especially the issue of MIAs and POWs.Donna herself was an Army brat who lived at Schilling Manor. She wrote the book based on her own family's experiences as well as countless interviews with other families.This book recounts a valuable piece of U.S. history.--- Phyllis Zimbler Miller, author, MRS. LIEUTENANT: A SHARON GOLD NOVEL"
5,funny and poignant,"A cross between ""doctor in the house"" and the books of Oliver Sachs.Very moving (the ""success rate"" on brain surgery is pretty low) and flows naturally between trenches humor, horrible failure, and glorious success.A really refreshing read."
5,This book is remarkable !!!! I love it!!!!,This book changed my perspective towards neurosergury. I've always wanted to be a doctor; after reading this book I know exactly what I want to do after medical school.
3,don't expect much,"Just not what I expected.It didn't ""flow"" the way it could have to go from each different story.Just a bit disappointed"
4,"inside part works great, outside not as well","I've had this system for a couple of years. The portion of the system that stays inside works great. Went well over 12 months (probably closer to 24) on a single set of batteries. The outside temperature sending unit hasn't been as hot. Batteries don't last long and the outside unit died on us when it got wet. Seems it dosn't hold out water very well, which I find surprising for something that is supposedly designed to function in all weather conditions."
5,KID ROCK COULDN'T BE BETTER,"I have never really been a big Kid Rock fan mainly because all I could hear when I listened to his music was cussing and screaming, but finally he has released an album that shows his true TALENT! I was absolutely amazed when I first heard this album. The Kid still rocks, but the music and vocals are impressive. Buy this album, you won't be sorry!"
5,Astroline lp300,"I am real pleased with floor jacks,I bought the low profile ones so they would go under any car.they work great,Iwould recamend this to anyone"
5,Great Pad.,"This is the best mouse pad I have ever owned. It's cool, and it works great, what more could you ask for?"
5,RAZER eXactmat,play games? want a mouse pad that doesnt suck? this is the best mouse pad you can buy and its no coincident that razer makes it
4,Great GAMING mouse pad,I recently purchased this mouse pad and I really enjoy it. It does take up alot of room...more mouse space than I could ever use though. I believe the wrist rest is a bit high so it can sometimes be a little uncomfortable for me at my desk. But even though that may sound negative I don't regret the purchase in the least and I would recommend this mouse pad to anyone that is into gaming.
3,DOES NOT WORK WITH LASER MICE!!!,"When I bought this product I had an optical mouse, it worked perfectly with the optical mouse. Both sides the speed and control worked very well (with an optical mouse). Then about a week later I got a Laser Mouse. The control side doesn't even work with the laser mouse and there is no difference with the speed side (Comparing the met and a hard desk.) The largeness of the mat and the gel pad are great. The gel pad is very soft. Everything about this mat is excellent, but IT DOESNT WORK WITH LASER MICE!!! So if you have an optical mouse this is a great choice. IF YOU HAVE A LASER MOUSE, DONT GET IT!!!"
5,Do You NaNo?,"This book is highly recommeded. Chris shares his insight and wisdom, and exudes great enthusiasm for his craft. He transfers that enthusiasm to NaNoWriMo participants through the chapters of his book, and through weekly words of encouragement through his site.If you are a would-be novelist, ""I would be if I had the time, money, energy, etc,"" then Chris has the solution you need. All you need is a . . . well, you'll want to get the book to find out what you really need to get the job done.Need something to do with the entire month of November that doesn't involve gorging on turkey and prematurely beginning the Christmas shopping? NaNoWriMo is the answer, and No Plot? No Problem! is a NaNoer's (newbie or veteran) guidebook to success.It's only 50,000 words in 30 days. You probably say more than 50,000 words in a month just yelling at the dog for digging up the yard -- so, write them down in a book and call it ""Notes to Fido."" No one said the book had to be good. It just has to be."
4,"Good advice, but after that you're on your own","Chris Baty gives you some pointers to psyche up your novel writing mind into hyperdrive. The focus here is on deadlines and freewriting to basically free up your writing and bypass your inner censor. The tone is humorous, which is a relief to some 'how to' writing books that imply completing a novel is tantamount to ending the world's AIDS crisis. I'd present two caveats though. It would have been more accurate to title the book Guide to Writing a _First Draft_ of a novel in 30 days because although his tips about completing 50,000 words in a month are clever, it doesn't mean your writing will be. In fact, even Baty would admit, your completed draft might be total sh_t. And it also should not be implied that now that you have a first draft, all you have to do is rewrite. You could rewrite it 50 times and it still will be total sh_t."
5,My current favourite reading material,"Even if you don't plan to write a novel in 30 days, this has a lot of good advice for those who wish to develop their creative literary skills. My kids and I couldn't stop laughing over some of Mr. Baty's wry remarks (my favourite being where he claims to need to change writing venues frequently, visiting cafes, hotels and airport concourses with his laptop computer, to keep himself focused, as he says he has ""the attention span of an aphid."")"
2,Today's Secret Word is ...POSER!!!!!,"This band sounds like an ""Alice in Chains"" party. Whoever said that this singer can wail like Layne Staley and Chris Cornell must have bumped his head really really really hard. He's not half as good and the band is nowhere near as creative. Maybe after a few more albums (if they develop their own style) he may come close to Staley.Alice in Chains is gone for good folks. Jerry Cantrell can't do it alone and no one else can replace them by sounding like them. Saying Dropbox comes close is really reaching. Let's just not try anymore. No more riding coattails, K? Thanxbye!"
3,Broken after 2 days of shooting,"Camera would mysteriously stop working for periods of 15 minutes. Pictures taken were grainy when shot with green or sport. On review of the photos, I found the built in algorithms refused to shoot the camera faster than f5; instead the ISO was always shifted to 400 and 800.(don't they have confidence in their lens?) Also noted a powerful tendency to underexpose; even a balanced subject illumination did not seem to prevent this problem. Auto exposure button is hard to use. Best part is camera's simplicity, SLR, and light weight. But my canon A80 photos are better by every measure. Too bad; bottom line of a camera is output. A simple, cheaper rangefinder easily beats it."
2,"Not posters, plotter printouts.","I just received these ""posters"" today. These are not posters as you would think. They are simply plotter printouts on standard paper. I was expecting typical laminated posters. These have no protection from dirty fingers, humidity, etc.. Heck, I have a plotter (Designjet 500 42"") and could have done this myself for much cheaper. If you are looking for laminated posters you need to look elsewhere."
4,Tony's program works!,"This is a well thought out program. The book is written in an easy familiar style. It's as if Tony was right there talking with you like your personal trainer. It includes information on what to eat- and more importantly what not to eat. Like a good personal trainer it points out common errors in the form of exercises. The program is progressive in intensity. It is based on sound principles of exercise physiology and psychology. The only reason it won't work for anyone is failure or inability to follow it. If you're serious about losing weight, improving your level of physical fitness, and you're willing to make the commitment, this is the book for you. Buy the book and ""just do it"". You'll be glad you did."
4,A captivating read,"I very much enjoyed ""Destiny's Road"" - it's one of the better SF novels I've read this year. The novel focuses on adventure and discovery rather than on ""whiz-bang"" science. Destiny's Road may not push the envelope like Niven's past works (Ringworld, ...) - and this may disappoint some fans. However, it is a captivating read, with just the right pacing - making the book hard to put down. I stayed up past my bedtime a few times just to see what Jemmy would discover next down Destiny's road. I'm looking forward to a sequel."
1,Skip this one,"I've read lots of Niven's books, and all were good or excellent.Except this one. I seriously wonder if Niven even wrote this himself.I'm really sorry to say it, but its awful."
3,charted territory,"as a fan of Larry Niven's works, I am somehow disappointed of this narrative, a resemblance of the integral trees-smoke ring novels. The castaway human colony plot is used material, with the rising-to-knowledge character. The pace is steady, but the main character (Jeremy, etc), suddenly stops his quest for 20-odd years, clearly just for plot's purpose... Anyway, Niven is unique creating environments, though my favourite still is the Kobold in Vandervecken. Sorry, Larry, we're used to better things. Try harder next time."
2,"Could have, would have, should have","This could have been such a great book. There is creative science fiction throughout, but you only get a glance, and then the story moves on. I was frustrated that Niven didn't elaborate on the planet life much at any point. Also, because the main character is constantly moving, the characters change SO frequently that by mid-book, I just wanted it to end. Just when you figure out who Niven is talking about, he abandons them and you are faced with a large band of new people. Even the main character's name keeps changing! I got 3/4 through this, flipped through the rest, realized that the endless stream of new characters was indeed endless, then quit. It just became a struggle to keep up with what was going on. Too bad, it had such potential."
2,Disappointing novel in sequence,"This novel describes the social structure of a human colony on a distant world, and the journey of a young man through this world where he discovers the truth behind his society is not quite as he had thought.I have read both the Dragons of Heorot and Beowulfs legacy - two 'sister' novels to this one, and found both of them to be gripping. This novel although it stands alone - seems to run out of steam half-way through.I found that by the end I really did'ne care too much about the fate of the primary character.I enjoy Larry Nivens work - this novel just did not grip me in the way that the others have."
3,"Not for ""leftys""","I like the opener, except being left handed makes it a little difficult to use, you can still use it though, but it's a little awkward. Bottom blade is sharp but not very long, still I can get it to go through a plastic package with a little muscle, after that I insert the top blade and just push; package opens easily. I really have been putting it to the test this season opening cardboard boxes I received in the mail. (on line black fri. shopping, don't you know). I was glad I had it! I would have given it better rating if it was more left hander friendly. If you are right handed, this will be a breeze for you! Merry Christmas to all."
4,"The little blade is very useful, the larger one not so much","I have several of these, and use them to open boxes all the time. They are superior to a standard box cutter for this, because the blade only sticks out a little bit and is therefore less likely to cut too deeply into the package and damage the item within. I also like that it is spring loaded, so when not in use it disappears back into the handle.The front of the device, however, is not very useful. In order to make the plastic ""jaw"" strong enough, they made it very thick. Too thick to easily slip into the package and slide along to make a cut.So, if you are just looking for a better boxcutter, this is your product. If you want something more versatile, try this instead:Zibra ZPCOPEN-OR Open It Universal Package Opener"
2,Handy but 50% fuctional,"I purchased these for home and gifts but in using it for about a year. Only the lower, spring loaded blade is useful. The front blade is too dull for most cutting, too thick to get in a box .. so I don't use that part.Good features: Good hand grip, bright yellow so I find it quickly, large enough to find easily and has no rough edges to dig into my hands. Better than using sissors. Handy with packages and boxes I receive."
5,Wholly Mackeral,I picked this book up on a recommendation from a friend. I was pleasantly surprised at the author's unique ability to paint a humorous landscape surrounding the reality of our litigious society and killer business tactics. Lawrence Townsend had me laughing out loud (a rare occurrence when reading a book).
3,"Funny, but not as good as season one.","The true A&C; fans will still like season 2, but it is not as good as season one. It lacks the enthusiasm of the first group of supporting actors. It is almost subdued compared to season one. Even the opening credits song is lackluster. A&C; themselves did not seem as energetic about this season. Maybe it was because so many of the supporting cast had left.The bonus material is excellent however, as his two living daughters share a treasure of family movies as well as talking about their family lives. Again, true fans will like this. All in all it's worth it to own both seasons just to have the complete set."
2,Good idea but...,"I guess what I really don't like about this Treat Launcher is you have to use their treats - they are not easy to find, I guess you have to order on line and can not just stop in a pet store and purchase. It actully works very well, but the treats are so small that the dogs have a hard time finding them."
1,How embarrassing,"First of all I grew up a HUGE Harry Connick Jr Fan and also a Broadway fan. To have the 2 merged last year should've been a climax...instead it was an embarrassment. Connick should've listened to SONY and passed on recording this. What a lousy cast! Kate Lever-who? She was unbelievably god awful (to be blunt) I've never heard someone sing so bad...on both this album and 42ND ST. How is this girl working? And Craig Bierko? All he did in Music Man was a bad impersonation of Robert Preston. Sorry he didn't have a movie to copy from for this show, he might've done a good job.Please don't ever make the mistake of documenting horrible shows like this again Harry! Go back to big band jazz! I'd still love ya!"
1,Broken Can't get replaced?,"I Ordered a set of Sunpro CP8091 Mini Triple Gauge Kit - White Dial.Installed very easy into my Bronco 2. But The Oil Gauge was broken. Ordered a month ago, still waiting on replacement.Amazon said I ordered from manufacture, Not Amazon. Amazon is out of stock. Web Page shows 4 in stock 11/28/11"
3,Stars and Stripes,"Well, if you want to see Pandora this is just a tease. While all the girls look gorgeous, its more art than skin. Its a must for light viewing. No men involved, just lovely women to be appreciated."
2,Watch out Dolby Digital users,"Nice Tv except if you plan on playing a DVD using the component video inputs and your surround sound receiver. There is a delay in the video. Its like your watching and old Bruce Lee movie the lips move then you here the sound. It is most noticable when you use the TV speakers and your surround system at the same time. There is an echo first the sound goes through the TV then your system. I did this by accident the first time its pretty weird. There doesn't seem to be a problem when using the s-video input. Maybe a slight delay. This TV is fine if you plan on using the TVs speakers only. I asked Zenith about this problem and there very vague answer was ""Thank you for your e-mail. That's a compatible problem between the unit and the surround sound"". Be careful Home theater buffs."
2,Dying young without knowing your popularity,"The lives of four young Frenchmen in the early 20th Century are explored in context with the world around them. The tragedies of existence for four creative forces of our century can only be justified by the gifts of genius they left behind. Jarry, Rousseau, Satie and Apollinaire have given so much to define the 20th Centur"
3,Eh.....,"A discombobulated Chad Johnson hosts dvd of random highlights. Some of it's entertaining. Some of it's edited horribly. Tiny snippets are pasted together so fast it feels like A.D.D. If they're gonna show the play, show the freakin' play. Generally, the players they chose to focus on are good. Over all, this could have been a lot better if they'd showed more highlights in their entirety and cut down on the ocho cinco jibberish. Let Randy Moss host the next one and show all his good stuff back to college. I'd pay twice as much for that."
3,depressingly enlightening,"I find this book fascinating for many reasons. My wife and I have just decided to have a baby, and I had read excerpts on salon before the book itself. I found myself agreeing with many of the sentiments expressed. In the decision, I found myself trapped by my own selfishness, and found that mirrored in many of the essays. But I thought: what if my parents had been this selfish? What if all they were concerned about was the mess their kids would turn their house into? The loss of free time? To be honest, I was very concerned that I wasn't ""cut out"" for parenthood - but reading these essays, I came to grips with my selfishness, and realized there's more to life than me."
2,"But really, Baby.","This definitely sides with the ""but no, really, have a baby"" side of things. Most of the fence-sitters end up having kids, and really glad they did. There are a couple essays of people who didn't have kids, and are happy with that, but were always 100% sure they didn't want to have kids, not 96% sure and they're going to help you figure out if that 4% will eventually grow to be a larger percentage. Notably, there were also NO essays of people saying, yeah, I had kids and I love them, but if I had it to do over again, I wouldn't, or I'd wait until later in life to have them, or I'd have fewer, or anything other than 'turns out, kids were totally the right decision.' It was totally useless and unhelpful."
2,"Baby Baby, not Maybe Baby","These essays definitely side with having a baby - so if you are expecting a lot of validation for feelings at the opposite end of the spectrum, you won't find them here. The essayists in the opening (slim) section ""No Thanks, Not for Me"" express a good deal of ambivalence and regret over their decisions to not have children, and would have been better placed in the ""On the Fence"" chapters. All of the pieces when taken as a whole are decidedly pro-parenting, and in many ways made me feel worse about my own mixed feelings. The writing is good, but this collection will not help anyone leaning toward ""no baby""."
3,Solid supplement; needs more perspective.,"This book is a role-playing supplement at its best; it contains great information for game masters (ie personalities, factions, and excellent unit overviews). It does have the traditional roleplaying fault of being top-heavy; not enough time is spent describing the 'typical' unit or tactics. The main problem with this supplement is that it is purely first-person. As much as college literature classes are saying that 3rd person is dead, at least for a game it is important that some perspective is given from a 'neutral' point of view- ie a twentieth century viewpoint- to stress subtleties that they wouldn't notice about themselves or their societies. Minor quibble; otherwise an excellent supplement."
4,Good for clan players or those who like lots of b-tech trivi,"I loved the detail FASA put into this one, one practically comes away jumping to play one of the4 new Clans, or revise one's J-F or Wolf forces to work within the new guidlines. Though it did not have enough new tech for my liking, the Heavy lasers and special elementals were a welcome addition to my Clanner arsenals. The only problems I really had were FASA's usual toying with it's history(continuity, people, continuity). But, this is over lookable when one takes into account the wondeful new feature this book had: a complete index! That, if anything makes this book worth 3 stars, and the complete breakdown of the clan galaxies and special modifiers based on their tactics(in some cases on a cluster by cluster basis) makes this a superb addition to the Battletech line...and I look forward to introducing standard elementals to the Gnome and Salamander suits."
3,half decent,"I bought this cd rather naively - I needed two more for a 5 cd dealy-thing, and it looked like something with nice beats to keep me up and dancing and whatnot. Wrong. While these cds definently has some songs considered hits on them, they're not something you would put in your player on random for action all night... The first cd starts off very uptempo and fast, then somewhat mellows out, into the second cd. I pretty much skip here and there to avoid the songs I don't wanna hear - although some people enjoy it, I'm not really one for the super trendy teeny bopper type of stuff. Some of these songs are just plain cheesy. I guess if you tune out the lyrics, it's half decent. It's not too heartbreaking to shove something else in the player in place of this one... the Night at the Roxbury soundtrack is really killer though."
4,Plain basic BM,"eh...you guys are reviewing the wrong CD.This is barathrum's Saatana release here not moonsorrow.I cant really say much here,mostly because there is not very much that can be said.This is all been done be for by many other bands,nothing new or innovative here,but its not bad,it is good Black Metal and worthy of a listen."
4,Stories That Teach Valuable Lessons,"This collection of short stories addresses issues teenagers face in a very real way. I looked over the Table of Contents before I began to read and wondered which story I'd like the most. After reading ""Jacobs' Rules"", which teaches a very important lesson about relationships, I thought I found it. But ""A Letter to My Daughter"" turned out to be my favorite. It took a lot of courage for Alicia's absentee father to write this letter; teaching her about boys, and, more importantly, admitting he fell short when he was with her mother. Any girl who receives a letter like this from her dad, absentee or not, has a dad who truly loves her, and she should certainly heed his advice.The author did a good job with these stories; some sad, and others thought-provoking or entertaining. Whether male or female, teens should read this book."
2,This Book is Stunning!!!,"Say folks, this be a good book. I mean I done just read it and it is real good. I don't live in them flyover states. But, that Laura she makes some real good points. For example, them elites think they are real smart. But what do they know? I got out of the 10th grade and I got me a real middle class job making new doors for the rich people. I think these elities--like the teachers and TV news talking heads people and doctors just don't know whaat the heck they are talking about. So just shut up and do your jobs. Just because some-may of went to college and some of them movie types of people worked real hard and learned from their real world experiences, don't give them the right to tell us real people like you, me and Laura what to think about. So read this book. It be good. Huh, What...."
1,Ingraham should follow her own advice,"and shut up. What makes her so uniquely qualified that her opinion is so much more valid than those she attacks? I'd love for Laura to enlighten me on what makes her more of an expert on politics than a lifelong activist like Martin Sheen or Mike Ferrel, the former chair of Human Rights Watch. At least these guys contribute to the arts on the side. Ingraham has no other skill than flapping her gums and repeating right-wing talking points.This book is a hypocritical waste of paper"
1,There Should Be A Negative Star Rating,"Laura Ingrahm's latest shriek expands on her hatred of Bill and Hillary into democrats in general. The title, a jab at Barabra Streisand, underscores the terrible irony that so dominates this doleful - and, unfortunately, most visible - segment of American political thought, that Ingrahm's malevolent and sound bite opinions are somehow worth plunking bucks down to read. They aren't. My advice is to take the money and buy an extra catbox...it will be more utile...Then again, if you buy the book, you'll have a liner..."
1,Nice substitute for real political discourse,"For those content to substitute name calling and personal attacks for real political discussion this must be a fascinating book. A real feel good read for those who need to feel that they are ""real"" Americans and thus avoid any critical reflection. Beyond the endless cacophony of the O'Reilly-Limbaugh-Coulter-Ingraham diatribes there is some intellectual merit to some of the arguments. Unfortunatley when the inflated egos of the right and left (Moore-Franken-Ivans) publish their drivel it only just poisons the well of discourse. But then again this is not about discourse, but about becoming self-satisfied with one's own limited world view. And shut-up is so impolite."
2,Unless Your Name Is .....,"Blah, Blah, Blah ... I wish more people would boycott Bruce Springsteen, maybe I could get a stinkin' ticket to one of his concerts. As I suspected, this books should have been called ""Shut Up and Sing ... unless you're Darrell Whorley, Toby Keith, Dennis Miller, or Ahnold. Laura doesn't necessarily have a problem with celebrities who give their political opinion. Just the ones that don't agree with her. The book is mildly entertaining as Laura is a good writer, but nothing more than another political hatchet job with the common right wing theme - Agree with us -- or leave!"
1,Painfully bad,Ingraham rants incoherently throughout the book against anybody who disagrees with her. A typical example of intolerance and bigotry wrapped up in book format. Any hard core conservative with a brain would be ashamed to be thrown in the same category with Ingraham. Anybody else can just laugh.
1,Trying to make a buck!,"This book is nothing more than someone trying to make a buck. I can't believe I actually purchased this book, let alone read the entire thing. It is full of stupid opinions with nothing to back them up. I am not sure why Laura Ingraham thinks she is the expert on so many issues, but she comes across as really ignorant and very biased. Don't even waste your time or money on this book."
2,She is not as bad as Coulter at least...,"Ingraham has a few good points in the book, but her constant bashing of liberals gets very annoying.I'd like to see Laura Ingraham, Ann Couler and Dennis Miller write a book together. When the right wing fanatics get together and tell THEIR ""truth"", it gets entertaining."
1,Shut up and act,"Arnold Schwarzenegger has made nonesense out of the book's premise. He traded on his celebrity status to be elected to a political position for which he had no qualifications. Apparently it is fine if members of the Hollywood elite like Schwarzenegger and Charlton Heston trade on their celebrity status to promote right wing causes, but if a celebrity uses his/her status to support a liberal cause HORRORS!!"
2,A fresh viewpoint,"I read this book because, unlike many others of its class, it didn't say ""I hate liberals"" on the cover. (Examples: Hannity, Coulter, Savage, etc.)Instead, Ingraham hates ""elites."" What one discovers about 3 pages in is that ""elite"" is Ingraham-speak for ""liberal.""So to put it in a nutshell: I don't know about anybody else, Laura, but yes, I do think that you, your personal version of God, your SUV, your radio show, and everything else about you is STUPID. That must make me an elitist, but I will try to bear that shameful label with a modicum of dignity.Two stars for effort, none for content."
2,"Shut Up & Sing: How Elites from Hollywood, Politics, and the UN are subverting America","I was anxious in getting the book and reading it. After I finished I found an excellent place for it,.......in my fireplace.Too many twists and turns, I have no idea of what she is trying to say. Its as though with each issue, she rambles on her thoughts, though regardless of the conflicts previously expressed in other issues.Check the book out of the library, don't waste buying a copy"
3,fun but read on,I love this game. The only problem I'm having is that I just got a new Computer with Vista and I'm unable to download the game onto it. I still need to go to Pogo.com and see if there's a solution.
3,Good but...,"This is a DVD of short film clips throughout the years with commentary. More like a documentary than a dvd of short films. Although not what I expected, it was interesting."
5,Great set!,Mt husband and son both really love this set! It has been watched many times! This is a must have for any Broncos fan!!!!
2,Fun......but come on!,"Who put this set together? 3 games? That's it? NFL films can and should do way better than this. Look at the other teams 7 disc sets and tell me why Denver gets 3 games total. Yes, they are great games...but only 3?Also don't expect anything except the games. No pre-show or post, no ""this ones for John"", zip...nada. The games are cut too. Great to have this on DVD sure, but don't expect much. Too bad Ebay pulled the plug on selling burned copies that people originally recorded on VHS.If anyone knows where we can trade our personally burned copies, I would love to know.Disappointing at best."
3,"So bad it's good?? Well,in a way......","Where to begin?? ""The Beast that Killed Women""is about an ape that has escaped and terrorizes(?)a nudist camp..Well actually he only kills one girl that I remember,but anyway...It's a fun movie.Look for the bonfire go from high to low and back and forth..some continuity problems?? As far as ""The Monster of Camp Sunshine"" goes it has to be seen to be believed.Why?Well,there is more music,less dialogue,too much padding and the so-called ""monster"" doesn't really do anything,except run around with an ax and only hurt 1 victim..The ending is laughable....It's not bad for what it is though..A movie that doesn't take itself seriously....The rest of the DVD has some pretty neat extras..."
4,Great book,This book provides all the background of starting with the wood selection to proper techniques.Great reference for bowl turners.
5,She had me hooked starting with Page One,"Cogent observations from her own life, as lived by the characters in this book. Page two: ""... when talk show hosts begin interviewing one another, someone or something somewhere is being rendered obsolete. The audience, say."" And it gets better as it goes along. You will want your airplane to be delayed even longer, so you can read more of the book before the plane comes."
3,good but look carefully,"My boyfriend is a big Packers fan, so I bought him this set for his birthday. Since he received them, he has watched them a number of times. There is one MAJOR flaw in the set, though. The set that we received is missing the disc with the 2003 Packers Vs. Raiders - (Favre Stars In Tribute To Father) game, and instead includes a duplicate disc of one of the games with the Seahawks! This upsets me, because my boyfriend is a HUGE Brett Favre fan, and really wanted to see that game. Unfortunately, he is unwilling to part with the rest of them long enough for me to exchange it. So just check your discs carefully when you order this....."
4,"great quality, but...","i think the video is of the best quality, but i would have picked super bowl 1 and 2 and the ""ice bowl""for 3 of the games. i long to get super bowl 1 and 2 in their entirety. the hey day of vince lombardi and the 60's packers.thanks! let me know if there is a blue ray or dvd of the entire start to finish super bowl 1 and 2. i will continue to use your site for future purchases.darrell worsfold"
4,Dr. Siri fan,"It was a fun little mystery. Enjoyed it. Not sure or not if I would read another one, but no complaints about this one."
4,Discover the Coroner!,"I've read all the Coroner books now and look forward to more. It's a gentle buddhist/shamanistic/southeast asian world that's an education to sink into. The tone is ironic, sometimes sad, often funny. I highly recommend this series. Cotterill is a gem to discover."
3,It depends on..,"Siri Paiboun the coroner, as a character, his life, his surroundings, and his job in a Communist Laos overshadow the rest of the characters and the mysteries introduced in this novel, written in an unpretentious fresh witty style and placed in an exotic atmosphere. This tale is useful to get a glimpse of the people of Laos, its culture, its geography, its location and its relation to neighboring countries, but I would not choose this novel if my only purpose is to enjoy something related to the mystery and thriller because in this sense all is made simple so it has not got what it takes to qualify as great in this genre"
1,Hewlett-Packard is a Cheat!,"I purchased a HP Pavilion TX1000. Within 12.5 months the laptop completely failed. The symptoms are as follows: (1) the wireless adapter fails and is undetectable; (2) the video fails; and (3) the computer does not boot anymore.I purchased a new wireless adapter to install. It did not work. I plugged an external monitor to the video card, but it did not show an image.HP knows that their is a design defect with this laptop, specifically the nVidia chipset that they use. The laptop overheats and destroys the motherboard.DO NOT BUY HP! They have refused to acknowledge its design defect and have refused to help any of the costumers who have wasted upwards of $1200.00 USD from purchasers! In fact, I have written to the CEO's office twice and to no avail, they have refused to help me. They claim that their research group has not identified the TX1000 as a problem and refuse to recall the product or investigate out problems! They are liars, cheats and crooks!"
1,Technical problems after one year,"I loved this computer for the first 14 months. At 15 months, the wireless card stopped working. After many calls with HP, they determined the wireless connectors on the mother board were failing and said it would cost over $400 to get it fixed. After reading many forums, I'm finding this is a very common problem. Warning - search on wireless, HP Pavilion XT1000, problems and be advised before you buy this product."
2,false advertising,"After hearing this album the only song i really like is ""fast cars"". It's a great track but the rest of the album i hate. Ironically that is the track played during the commercial (i saw no music video) and it is that track which first got me interested. But after hearing it i realized all rza did was make one good song and use it in the promotion. after that he filled the album with garbage but who cares since we already bought it right?Side note- fast cars was such a good track it upped the album 1 whole star."
4,almost perfect (4.5 stars),"first off...I gotta say....the production on this is off the hook. Even though the production values obviously are higher, this still sounds like wu-tang. Like the first Bobby Digital cd, the instrumentals on this cd could live on an album on their own. Rza has outdone himself in this regard...and has some incredibly talented people working with him on this one.I do agree with some one else, that sometimes the lyrics seem lazy. Most Wu fans have been waiting for a Rza album with Rza rhyming in the ultra intellectual way he has on early wu albums, and that part doesn't start kicking in until about 4 songs from the end..where it gets really deep. But I believe that is what the plan was. To show the development of Rza/Prince Rakeem as a person. I have the a feeling it'll get more indepth next album and even more so in the one after that. But this is by no means trash. The only other Wu albums that compare are Cuban Linx and Liquid Swords."
1,horrible,"I wish i read the reviews before i purchased this one, god i found myself constantly skipping through the tracks getting pissed off, i have been a gza fan with rza production since words from the genius and the formation of wu-tang clan and to come to current times and see birth of a prince it's very depressing, we all know whats true rugged and raw hip-hop and wu-tang has shown many times that it's king of that,I dont know what state of mind they are in but they need to awake."
2,IS HE THIS DESPERATE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Rza: ""Birth of a Prince"": Rza is an idiot...if you can keep this in mind then you can enjoy this work and maybe even see it's brilliance...he's brilliant in his ideas but classically and intentionally crude in his executions...the CD starts off very mainstream sounding, but possesses many twists and turns through familiar Wu territory (IE: monotonous loops with sub-par freestyling)...for now it's staying in my collection because it's worth it's weight (since I found it used for $5) and it seems to be better than Bobby Digital 2...it's not in the bottom rung of Wu records, but it also still falls well short of Cuban Links, Liquid Swords, Ironman, or Bobby Digi #1..."
3,My Second Wu CD,"This is my second Wu Tang Clan album, I got it because of the amazing ""liquid sword"". In this album, RZA shows great delivery and has a pretty good rhyme. But when I first heard this album, I thought it was somewhat of an underground mixtape because the quality of the tracks (Instrumental) is definitely not on the level of ""Liquid Sword"". Some songs ARE wack and plain untolerable. Nothing really caught me when I heard this album unlike the unique style heard in ""Liquid Sword"". Don't get me wrong, this is still a solid album with solid songs just nothing really special and the wack songs pulls it down. RZA produced a great album on ""Liquid Sword"", but he did not have t hat kinda of production on this cd either.Lyrics:B-Deliver: BProductioN: B-Overall: B-"
5,good buy,This is a great album if your a wu tang fan you will love this i wasent to sure on my 1st listen but eva since my second listen i cant stop playing it. Its just a great rap album and you cant go wrong - www.methical.com rating 5 stars
4,not the best sound quality on earth but......,this amplifier can certainly push some subs i had it running 2 10's for almost a year before i sold it. it never really got overheated pushing the 2 800 watt 10's and its still working for the guy i sold it to. it does however reproduce a hollow bass note from the subs that would hardly be noticable if your bass was in a trunk. i wouldnt recommend this amp for s.u.v or hatchback apps.
2,1400 Watts is a deffinate overstatement,This amp might put out 25%as much as it says it does. But what is to be expected for the price.
3,didnt last long *edit*,"I got this a few months ago to find it made m 2 subs hit hard, now it doesnt work, just spend the extra 50$ on a name brand that actuall lasts*update*works again just blown fuse, but over heats very easily 1-2 hour car drives so bewarned"
2,not bad,"I had this amp in my dodge intrepid with just 2 ten inch alpines. worked great at first but then added a 12 inch pioneer sub. It didnt get hot at first but then I drove about 70 miles with the bass not turned up all the way but just to mix it all in, to make all the music sound good. i smelled something burning and i opened up my trunk and there was a lil bit of smoke coming out of the amp. wtf? it got so hot that it started melting my wires! it was a good amp for the first 6 months then started acting really weird. my advise is if you like rap, country, and metal then get a bigger amp. i just bought the 2000watt pyle amp and we are going to see if its any better. in conclusion this amp isnt bad but not good."
1,Coffin Crapola,"Material too bad even for MST3K. This film gets my vote for one of the worst movies of all time. Poorly acted and chock full of misogyny for all of us female viewers out there (he beats up and bloodies a woman before raping her) and before that our villain murders his wife because, he tells her, that her life serves no further purpose because she has failed to give him children and hey, she can't marry again anyway; this is during his torture killing of her via spider...death by spider? Maybe our magician-hat-wearing goofball got the idea from Dr. No, either way, this piece of junk is disgusting. Best part of the movie was THE END. Hopefully this movie will eventually become an unavailable relic of the past. And I see by its ""unavailable"" status that it has. A dream come true, thanks! And yeah, it's a horror movie all right - a horror OF a movie."
3,A few things you should know about 'At Midnight I'll Take Your Soul',"Although I'm not a huge horror fan, I recommend this to anyone who is. It was the first true horror film made in Brazil, and features a moaning, wind-howling, disturbing soundtrack, whereby even the cheesiest lines (like the warning from the witch at the start) become atmospheric due to sound effects and delivery.Coffin Joe the undertaker is an unpleasant little oik (with a stylish top hat), and is entertaining due precisely to his exaggerated unpleasant insouciance. All he wants is a son to carry on his bloodlines. He is determined that nothing will stand in the way of his plans, even if it means killing those closest to him..."
5,We need more books like this,"Dr. Hoppe is one of the best libertarian/anarcho-capitalist writers out there. This book is well argued and well written. More writers should take Hoppe's lead in expanding on the themes here. Even if one finds contention with some of his ideas, largely one is left with a refreshing perspective not found in the usual drivel to be had in the social sciences. Highly recommended and worth having as a reference and an example of how to write well and reason well.Certainly for a libertarian or anyone interested in the themes of freedom this is a must have. Highly recommended."
2,False description,"My 2 received are the same as the other reviewer, including no cedar. I don't think it is Amazon's error since the item's packaging shows the same photo. Rubbermaid is at fault. I guesss the bright side is more canvas, but I agree w/ the other reviewer that one wants to be able to quickly tell what's inside and likely one will have to unzip the bag."
2,Little in So Many Ways,"I began to read this book with great expectations because I hold both Blanchard and Shula in such high regard. Perhaps my expectations were unrealistic but I had hoped for some penetrating insights; instead, I found recycled material from previous publications. Shula is among the greatest football coaches ever but has also achieved great success in an equally competitive environment, the restaurant business, so I had hoped for some of his observations about that. None. Blanchard is among the most innovative thinkers about business and presumably sees all manner of subtle but significant correlations between a great CEO and a great coach. None. From a marketing standpoint, the book's concept is clever. In terms of execution, borrowing a situation from football, it is a fumble on the authors' own goal line."
1,FARSE,"Simply put, Heaven Next Stop is a farse. Sold as a ""a real tale about a German fighter pilot in World War II"", it is not !! The book gives no names , no squadron number, no date, no data, no technical details. We got only a few first names, that's all. If that was not enough, the writer is really bad, he can't write ...!"
1,AMAZINGLY BAD....,"The idea of this book escapes my mind. There is no data at all. Weonly know the writer flew in the Luftwaffe because he says so, becausehe doesn't say his unit number, he doesn't say the names of his pals, he doesn't say even the dates when event sdescribed took place , nor even the month or the year ! It is one of the worst self-written biographies of WW II ever to be published. THis doesn't serve even for the die-hard readers of combat aviation. A total waste of time."
4,Looks good,I purchased this as a gift for a friend. The ornament arrived in good condition. And I would say was worth the price.
4,Ms. Webber's Socialist Point of View,"This lady obviously cannot see the proverbial ""forest...."" She clearly misses that the laws she cites are where the muggings begin.Most of these laws if adequately challenged would prove to be unconstitutional and would be struck down. Of course Ms. Wand her ilk are quite transparent and their views on any subject under the sun can easily be predicted, in this case: ""the Constitution is an evolving document..."" that is meant to serve an ever growing and intrusive government and has little to do with individual rights. Hey, where she chooses to reside says it all!"
5,Great book!,"This book is a non stop thrill ride through the mind of Walt Whitman. James Dougherty is a genius who will never be appreciated in his time. You snooze, you loose. A steal at $34.00"
5,I do this every a.m.,I love this table....I go to the chiropractor anyways and he told me no more than 5-7 minutes 2x a day. I can feel my body unfold and initially was pressure on the head but now I can fall asleep upside down. I feel it helps me with stress and my posture has improved which is actually why I got it. This is the first thing I do when I get out of bed. I think you will be happy you bought one.
5,A Wonderful Soundtrack,"This is such a great soundtrack!! I loved all the singing in the movie and I like this soundtrack a lot, too!Mandy Moore is a great singer and Omer is very personable and so we keep rooting for him.The way the [...] Arab/American cousin sings & dances is absolutely HILARIOUS.I would most certainly rate this 5 stars."
5,Outstanding,"This applies to not only Crush Depth, but to all of Joe Buff's books... I first encountered Joe Buff when I picked up Straits of Power - and then rushed out and bought the rest of this ""series"" and read them sequentially cover to cover - did not get a lot of sleep that week! Highly recommend. As good or better than Clancy's Hunt for Red October. Can't wait for more from Joe."
3,Good Value,"This is a very informative series which had been produced for TV. It is approached from an objective manner and is not overtly religious in view, even though there is the obvious perspective that devibe untervention occured in the forming and survival of the State of Israel - which I agree with. It is a series that could be enjoyed by Christians and Jews - or just objective seekers."
5,An awesome documentary,"It was fabulous..., just an awesome piece of film work to show how awesome The Lord is."
5,A SUPER READ!,This is one of my ALL TIME FAVORITE books! I read it years ago and kept it. I still go back and reread it from time to time. I highly recommend this to all readers!
2,warm - fuzzy - sappy - dull,"Originally published in 1969 under the title _A Place for Us_, this work may have been a breakthrough in its time, but now its a giant step backward for lesbian fiction. The characters in this book, while touchingly in love, have not the realist punch necessary to keep this book going. MOre importantly, if we are to analyze this book from a socially aware perspective, it seems that the social interactions are poisoned by a ``butch-femme'' conflation of expression and orientation. There currently no shortage of far, far better novels out there, both lesbian and not."
5,Its hard to live Cheries life!,"I think its strong by cherie to write a book about her life, cause she hadn't exactly ""the perfect life"" I really liked the book and give it 5 stars!"
2,Wrong Brush,"I ordered the older style toothbrush with bristles all the same length, but I was sent the new style with uneven bristles. This is what is currently sold in the local store. The picture is deceptive and shows the older style that I expecting to receive."
1,Incomplete!!!,I purchased this as a christmas gift and recently found out that some tools were missing! How embarrassing! They probably thought I gave a used gift.
2,Dissapointment,"I got this in-dash DVD/CD/MP3 player by Pyle to use with my in-dash motorizedmonitor with tuner also by Pyle, problem was the player had a built in fan that made a terrible noise while playing or listening to the radio. Tried to fix the problem myself but ended up scratching the outer metallic finish. It also didn't have an auxiliary input, making my TV tuner pointless. Went to Frys and got a Valor DVD/CD/MP3 player that work swell, cost $20 more but worth every penny, got all the functions I needed."
4,Great book!,"This book is simple to read and very helpful! When looking to remodel, a friend recommended I read this book and I'm very glad I did! The book taught me how to protect myself and get the best work for my dollar. Anyone looking to remodel should read this book before hand!"
3,A Gambler's Magic,"When a travelling preacher leaves Joy Hardesty behind in Rio Hondo because she falls ill and his ministry can't be slowed down, she comes under the care of Mac McMurdo. Joy seems very poorly named, for she has none. Religion is all about rules, without grace for her, and every thing that might bring her happiness is considered evil because happiness is evil to her. Mac has some idea of what will heal the spiritual abuse she has undergone, and in some way, brings her into the life of Elijah Perry, a gambler who is shot and needs a nurse. Joy gets elected to the role. At first, the two get along like oil and water, but over time, they begin to like one another, but Elijah has his work cut out for him.*** Joy and Elijah's story will remind you of the great old movies like the African Queen. Joy's transformation from a female Pharisee to who she really wanted to be is indeed a joy. ***Amanda Killgore, Freelance Reviewer."
4,Intech Beta Ti EXD Men's Golf Balls,Everyone around here is trying these. They are similar to PROV1s and they are great.
3,Pleasant journalism instead of history,"This is really an interesting book and someone who picks it up will feel very well informed and educated. This is excellent. The real issue however is the apparent rise of authors/journalists/amateur enthusiasts who are becoming the published ""historians"" of American culture. Again, the book is good for what it truly represents: 50% anecdotes, 25% personal history and 25% or often less real documented history. The real question is of course, when others are being cited, what is their status as to being actual researchers? Many of the citations in the text are from other authors who really are no different than the author, there are however others who are historians and scholars who are mentioned.Nevertheless, I find that the strongest part of the 'narrative' is when the author speaks unabashedly from personal experience, it is the most interesting and the most honest in the context of what the author would like to truly say."
4,Very Helpful,"Purchased this for a college class. HAD to buy it. The more I used it, the easier Italian became. Breaks down the information and dreaded verb conjugation easily. Wish the cassette tape was a CD - had to FIND something in the house that still played cassette - found an old walkman in the basement. A good buy as long as you have the help of a teacher to show you the way."
3,Enjoyed this,"Enjoyed reading this book,even though I had a hard time keeping up with what was going on. It took too long to solve the murder."
1,God Awful Condition,"I gave it one star not because of how good the book was but because of the condition the book came in. I could not believe how bad it looked the pages were crusted together, there were multiple holes that ran throughout the entire book, and the cover looked like it was about to fall apart. I bought this as a gift for my mother but after looking at how the book came i think im more disappointed than she will be on Christmas."
2,It was okay,The movie was okay. Some fighting but I've seen better Korean movies. I wouldn't want to watch it again because there was a lack of a story.
5,Best handheld ever!,"Nintendo has presented us with a tough choice: the new GBA SP or the Game Boy Micro. I was thinking about what I really wanted out of the Micro -- the bright screen, and the better ergonomics and controls. BUT the screen is tiny, and the SP's screen is plenty small as it is. I'm 35 years old and while my eyesight is perfect, there's no need to ruin that with a postage-stamp sized screen.So I bought a baby blue metallic new-screen GBA today. There are other pictures on the internet comparing the old and the new, but none with that old-time Atari flair that we know and love! Here are some screenshots of the Activision Anthology on the old and new system, side by side. It's difficult to photograph these things, so excuse the quality of the pics. This game has some bright, vivid colors which are NOT done justice on the washed out old-style SP, but they really come alive on the new one."
4,As Good As Expected,"I ordered the Pearl Blue SP with full knowledge of a scratched surface, however it was more than I expected. I wish there had been a picture of the damage for reference. I still would have bought it anyway. Overall, I received it on time and it was packaged nicely. It works perfectly. Battery holds a normal charge and the charger cord works. I'm very pleased."
4,This will keep your kids amused,"This will keep kids amused for a time. My kids have fun with it in spurts. This is their first video game ever, we don't have a console type game. They like it but since we only have one game for it, it's not always their first choice of something to do. One drawback is that we discovered that we cannot rent gameboy games from video stores. Only console games can be rented there. This is an excellent quality product."
5,Pretty In Pink,My daughter just loves this Game Boy! She is so proud to own a pink one. Totally different from others that her friends have.
3,poor packaging,Negligent packaging resulted in shaking around and destruction of interior package with resultant loss of parts thru cracks in exterior pkg.No evidence of faulty handling by Fedx. Can not use item yet b/c of missing parts.
4,Great quality,perfect size and quality the only problem was it came alittle rickled might of been due to usps but other than that it was fine
2,Lousy durability,"I purchased this heater last fall for my pond. It kept a small opening around the heater (about 1/2"") for a few months, then completely died. I would have expected it to last at least the entire season. What a waste of $$."
1,"Another ""rip-off""!!! This is NOT the REAL Post Mortem!",WARNING!!!!!!!! This is not the REAL POST MORTEM!!!! If you are looking to find material by the REAL POST MORTEM ---- the band who put out CORONER'S OFFICE and other LPs in the mid-1980s --- you will be VERY DISAPPOINTED! This is not the same band!!!! Be warned!!!
4,little duce coupe,i was really inpressed of the good sounds that i heard for the time period which they were recorded.to bad there not more of the beach boys live stuff to be heard.
1,fatal flaw,This book has one fatal flaw: as you learn the nouns you do not learn the gender of the noun. You then can't use the noun with a definite or indefinite article or adjective because you don't know which of the 3 forms to use with the noun. It is a basic rule of thumb that whenever you learn a new noun in Greek you should also learn its gender. For this book to teach the noun without the gender is inexcusable.
1,Zipper opens during washing/drying,"I should have paid attention to the review or reviews that stated the zipper did not stay closed. The first time I thought perhaps I had neglected to close it tightly. The next two times I double checked the zipper before washing and I had closed it tightly, Twice it has opened during washing and once during drying dumping everything in the machine. Who needs it!!!! I have a front loading washer and dryer.And I wash on the easy care or delicate cycle,"
2,If you liked Fournier...,"Wispelwey toys with the rhythmic pulse of the music to such an extent that the performance becomes a loose patchwork of little bite-size phrases. Its this regard, he does indeed bring to mind Pierre Fournier's recording of the same work."
2,Arrived defective but still works,One of the black knobs that turn off the water was broke when it arrived and the other valve doesnt shut all the way because it was machined it wrong.
1,Pathetic,"Which is sad considering how great the beginning was. The story just completely falls apart and is only slightly redeemed by a pretty cool ending. But, as a whole, it fails sorry.The main reason is that the artwork is just plain horrid. In the opening chapters it's competent enough but as the story progresses it becomes more and more ugly. I could do better than this. It's a shame considering how brilliant other Predator comics looked.The Predator is a truly awesome and iconic character. He deserves better than this. And so this is one to forget. Check out Predator: Dark River or Kindred instead. Those are really cool. This is not."
1,Super Solitaire 15 for PDA's,"This software is an extremely old program, so old that the serial number for the software does not work. Would not recommend anyone to purchase or make a purchase from the seller that sold this product. Seller should have expressed age of software and that the serial number for the product would be no good!"
4,Thank you!!,"Can't tell yet if the product will help, moisture-wise, though it's soft stuff. The only thing I don't like is the scent. I can tell they're going for the spa effect. I want it NOT scented, though some may love the smell. I have sensitive skin and eyes, and they tend not to like scents :).Not as creamy as I'd hoped for, and I have to get my foundation on pretty quickly after applying. Not sure I'd reorder, though I MIGHT if it were half the price. ""Crucial Moisture""? Not so sure."
2,Not what I expected...,"I had a small sample of a product with this same name on the label. The texture of what i had does not match the texture of the product inside this jar. I don't know if I bought the wrong thing or this is not the original product. So I can't say. It's OK, it a moisturizer, it seems to work alright, it's just not the same texture of what I thought I would get."
5,"Inspiring, Human and Effective Leaders","A fresh concise readily readable book on the management paradigm of appreciative leadership. A thorough discussion of this management model with a visual construct on page 159, a chapter linking theory and practice, and inspiring interviews with both renown and unsung appreciative leaders from a variety of organizational arenas. Use it to inspire , to train, to teach ,to motivate managers,staff, studentsand others. This book has both wisdom and vision for the future, edited by women of wisdom and vision, themselves appreciative leaders .,"
2,Ugh! Please!,"I understand that the author is married to a singer, but for goodness sake! She is one dimensional and crabby, and all the men are stupid and bigoted. There is also some of the most horrible revised lyrics I have ever seen in my life. An example: Modesitt gives us painfully childish renditions of Row Row Row Your Boat and Sing by the Carpenters, topped by a grotesque revision of the Battle Hymn of the Republic, which is supposed to be sufficient music to make powerful magic. PLEASE! Yuck. Look, reviewers, just because a man writes a woman character who isn't a complete bimbo or window dressing [rare in fantasy, I realize] doesn't make this whiney one a feminist icon."
3,"This book was fun, but...","for truly entertaining fantasy, read a Harry Potter book. While I can't deny that the book had me entertained for the day or so it took me to read it, I can't think of a book that left me less to think about afterward. Well, maybe I can, but it's not worth the effort. What I'm trying to say is, the entertainment was fine, but the level of inventiveness was low, the morality on thin ice, and the sneezing and eating all too frequent. What in the world was up with all the sneezing? The book had me convinced they were all going to die of the plague. Well, as another reader astutely observed, it's fine for an airplane ride. Skip it for your library of classics."
2,I'm very disapointed. I expected something much better.,"When I bought this book, I couldn't even finish it I got so bored. The first and second chapters are okay, but then it only goes down hill.Some of the reasons I disliked this book are that (A), It couldn't hold my attention, and (B). Almost every other chapter the author switched to past tense, or they talk like your right their watching everything happening. I think this would be a better book if the author could make up their mind about which one to use."
3,Just a plain decoration book ... with an attractive topic,You will find in this books the kind of articles you read in decoration magazines. Pictures are big but don't expect any artistic originality. A useful book if you plan to plant a tropical garden in your backyard.
4,Served it's purpose,"I bought this headset as a replacement for my xbox 360 headset that broke ages ago.I was quite pleased with the results =)The audio isn't bad at all, and the mic worked pretty well too.It wasn't uncomfortable to wear, and it didn't irritate the top of my ear where the plastic piece generally goes.Needed a volume control though, tired of noobs screaming in my ears."
3,okay,It's a bit pricey for what is received. I didn't expect the sides to be as flimsy as what they were.
2,Doesn't hold shape,"I purchased this item as an underbed storage and I picked this one specifically because of the low-profile since there is not much room between the floor and the bed.This item does not hold its shape. The bottom is fabric with nothing to make it structurally sound. The sides also do not hold their shape because the sides have several sections.If you put clothes or other items in it and tried to pick it up or move it to put it in place, it doesn't hold its rectangular shape. The bottom sags and you have to fight with it to make it fit in a rectangular shape.Very much disappointed."
5,Great,This used to be my favorite book and is still one of my favorites. It is about a young man driven by poverty to believe he is exempt from the law. He kills this old woman for her money and all throughout the book is sort of paranoid about whether people know he did it or not. Even though it starts out slow after the first few chapters it is VERY suspensful. Although the ending surprised me trhis is still a great book. The character Razumikhin is also cool too.
2,Crime and Punishment,"I did not get this translation, but another one.When I wrote to the seller he said I had ordered what I got - which wasn't true. he said he was a student and couldn't do anything about it.I really did want the Constance Garnett translation!! Is it possible to have it? I would still like to buy it!Fleur Palau"
3,A good enough ball for practice,"These balls seem to be an average golf ball. I use them on practice rounds and they are fine. Of course, prefer Titelest when playing rounds with friends when score counts."
2,Cheapest Balls!!,These are the cheapest new balls ever!! I'm happy I saved money. But you get what you pay for.
3,Beta Ti Golf Ball Review,"These Chinese balls are a good value especially for those of us who lose too many balls on the golf course to afford the best and most expensive golf balls. I find these balls have very good performance for one or maybe two rounds. Then they seem to lose distance after about 18 or 27 holes.Many people say they are comparable to much more expensive balls but this is not true. I think it is wishful thinking. They do not go as far, they do not hold the green as well and they do not have the same performance life as the Titleist PRO V balls or the Calloway Tour balls.For everyday use I use these balls. For tournaments or rounds that I feel are very important, I only use PRO V1s or PRO V1Xs."
2,Poor balls at a fairly cheap price,"I purchased these balls based on the reviews here. I was very disappointed. These are close to the worst balls that I have ever played. I would rather play with Rockflights (Top Flight) or Pinnacles than these balls. They are extremely hard and feel like a rock coming off of the club face. In my opinion these are suitable for range use, shag bags, poor golfers who could care less what balls they play, and children learning to golf.This review is not coming from a ball snob who only plays Titleist. I hate to pay more than $15/dozen. In fact my favorite cheap ball is a MC Lady (I am a man), which are often available for less than these balls. I bought these because I needed balls, didn't have time to run to the store, and fast Prime shipping. Never again for me."
5,WOW!,"I've always loves Jack Weylands books, but this one is beyond good. Sam, and it's sequel, Charly are so tear-jerking. Everytime I read Sam, I cry. Give it a try."
3,Short n' Sweet,"I think this story is ok. It's a pretty nice story, but then it's not exactly the kind of stories you GROW with. Like Little Women, or Anne of Green Gables. But if you're looking for a pretty short n' sweet book, this is it."
5,Affordable and Easy to Transport,"I am a Reiki practitioner and purchased this table because it is easy to transport and very affordable. The table is nice and sturdy, sets up and breaks down easily and is lighter than some other models out on the market. A good value for the money!"
5,A Night At The Roxbury Rocks!,"This a great soundtrack. I mean where else can you get the tracks #9,10,and 11 all in one. Don't miss out on this one. Buy it because these dance songs are sure to please the crowd, and all music lovers. 5 stars all the way!"
4,Great dance songs for a fun movie,This CD is awesome! Makes you want to get up and dance. It fits great with the movie (which was funny) and has a lot of energy. Great for the dancers in all of us.
3,I found this movie to be funny and the soundtrack fantastic.,"Although this was no 4 star movie, if you are familiar with the skit of these two brothers from Saturday Night Live, I think you will find this movie very amusing. It was created in the spirit of SNL and Chris and Will really pulled it off. People need to keep in mind when they go see this film, that they are not portraying real people, but fictitious characters, whose personality flaws are extremely exaggerated to make it even funnier. Also, I think the soundtrack is one of the best so far this year, and I am ordering it right away. Every song was better than the one before it. Great work SNL!!!"
1,wrong parts in package,Amazon was wonderful with timely shipping. However I have not been able to use the machine. In the process of constructing it the rocker arms were found to be the incorrect ones for the machine. They are on back order from the company and so I have parts all over the floor but no machine.
3,Lifegear Parts FYI : The Lifegear Company went out of business in 2007.,Lifegear Parts FYI : The Lifegear Company went out of business in 2007.Good luck getting warranty on Life Gear products.Foam pads break easily and are expensive.
4,LifeGear Inversion Table review,"Good product for the price. Friend has more expensive version, but we can't tell the difference. Only down side, and this isn't anything big, is that my husband and I each have to set the height adjustment 2"" taller than we actually are for proper performance. I was initially worried about the ankle padding, based on other reviews I had read, but find them very comfortable. I do prefer to wear shoes though. We would definitely recommend this product."
4,works,"not quite the most comfortable on the ankles, best if your wearing shoes. But works just like the best at half the price. Very sturdy, box is heavy and it does require some putting together."
2,Works but painful on the ankles/ feet - returned it,"I purchased this unit elsewhere (BJs for $129) and while my lower back feels great when I use it, I returned the unit because it hurt my ankles so much after inverting for more than 1-2 minutes.I am normal build - 6 foot - 180lbs and athletic. After 1-2 miniutes, the pain was searing."
3,Inversion or torture table?,"This item is certainly designed for quick and easy assembly. I had no problem with the instructions and all parts went together nicely. I have two herniated discs in lower back and was looking forward to some relief as others had commented these tables could deliver. After, several trials and adjustments to get it balanced properly, I can tell you, it does help. However, be prepared for some discomfort as the mechanism for holding your feet is discomforting. I rate the product good according to my own experience so far, but I have seen some other models with clamping mechanisms with better padding which certainly should be considered. I weigh 230 lbs. and that much weight hung by your ankles and feet is stressing to say the least. For the price and ease of assembly, persons with less weight should be quite pleased. Heavier souls, might want to consider a different model or add some padding yourself as I have to."
5,Great Product,"Product works great, sturdily built, free shipping on such a beast was a great value.The ankle supports hurt a bit when you're inverted, I've seen better designs to ""hold you"" upside down, but overall, good product, well built, works as described."
2,It's a wooden bowl with lid,"Echoing the other reviews, this is not quite deep enough for the Col. Conks soap. Which I can't fault it, I did read the reviews. I just don't understand why this product is paired up with the Col. Conks product, probably because people like me read the reviews and still purchase both anyway.Anyhow, it looks nice on my shelf and after a few shaves the soap begins to fit. But for 11 dollars, I think I could have used a classy coffee mug instead.Basically, its a bowl for holding soap, but it doesn't do that quiet as well as a free mug. Save your money and use something else."
3,Make it taller,"I had to cut the Kingsley soap in order to ge the lid to close. I would assume the Kingsley soap would be a perfect fit in the Kingsley Wood Shave bowl. I assumed wrong. But whatever, it's a nice wood bowl & I feel good holding it. It's not a tacky aerosol can."
3,Nice looking,"No question this is a nice looking box with cover. It will do fine for your as long as you don't use it to lather up shaving cream or soap. It is just too shallow to keep in the lather you generate no matter how little you use. Maybe it might do well for paperclips or such, just not lather."
3,didnt realise it was much smaller than I thought,"didnt realise it was much smaller than I thought. the wood is fine though, it seems to hold well as I use it."
2,PRETTY; NOT USEFULL,"Nice woodwork. The block of shave cream came to the very top of the bowl, so the lid would not sit into the bowl. When you want to whip up some lather, with the brush, the bowl is so light weight that you have to hold it with the other hand. The lid has no handle, so you have to pick up the lid from the side, and get slippery shave cream on your fingers, which you have to wash off before you handle the razor. Like some of the other things men have to deal with: they are pretty, but not very useful."
4,good buy,"I bought this amplifier over a year ago. Yes it still works just fine. This amp does get hot fast, but it will blow if you have anything less than a 4olhm load when bridged, but its a pretty decent amplifier especially for the money. The ""max"" rating is not what you should ever go by, go by the rms and for this it is 150 watts per channel or 300 watts bridged at 4 ohms. If you have it set up correctly it will last. DO NOT run anything under 2 ohms in stereo (2 channel) or 4 ohms bridged (mono or single channel). if you buy this amp and are new to all this and are unsure of what all this means feel free to ask and I'll help you out."
2,Overheats easily,My only problem so far is it heating up too quickly and it shutting it self off and having to reset it! I'm planning on unmounting it and putting a fan on it to help. It blew on me after 2 months of having it not a good amp if you like having working subs all the time
5,Outstanding Tai Chi Video,This is an outstanding and detailed instructional video. Take your time and learn each section thoroughly. Tai Chi in any form is filled with subtile complex movements. Doctor Paul Lam does a great job instructing the 24 Forms.
1,24 Forms Encoding Problems,Problems with Region 1 encoding made this DVD impossible to view. Total waste of money. This is the only DVD in my collection with problems so I know it is not my player. I expect I got a PAL Australian version.
4,It works in Win98SE computer,"We have an old Dell that the kids use for library video games and wanted to upgrade the memory. GOOD - it pops right in and works, BAD - I am not sure this is new memory, I ordered 2 and the both fit right but one is taller than the other - so they aren't identical physically. But it does work and inside my computer I don't have an esthetic issue, just found it odd."
1,Data transfer cable,"This was a disappointment but at the price what did I expect! Actually the literature said you could transfer files, data and pictures from your cell to your computer. My first attempts got nowhere so I called the vendor and they sent another copy. It was slightly better but still no pictures. The vendor provides no support by the way! After some time consuming 'research' I found that the product I would need cost about $25.00 so I gave up. I stopped taking pictures with phone (poor quality anyway). I didn't bother to return it because it only cost $3.95!"
2,Okay lead,"The small, fit in your palm lead seemed like a good idea when I bought it. However, I find it akward to hold - keeping my hand closed around the zip housing takes a bit getting use to - I'm use to the more traditional bigger retractables where my hand grips a 'handle'. It's not comfortable to put my hand thru the loop and let it hang. The locking mechanism isn't very consistent - doesn't lock every time- so I don't feel confident walking my dog when I need to keep a short lead. I won't purchase this product in the future."
1,Please do NOT be fooled!,"I bought this cosmetically appealing leash for my 10 lb bischon/poodle mix pup. It's a gorgeous looking device, though absolutely made of the poorest quality materials that I have ever encountered. Today, during a walk, the leash completely snapped in two! Thank GOD that I was able to grab my little dog right away so he didn't run into the street! This is a horrible leash! Please do not buy it, for the safety of your pet. It is completely undependable and faulty. I am in contact with Amazon to discontinue this product and will be dealing with the maufacturer as well."
2,Reviews were misleading..,"I read a lot of the reviews before ordering this product. I ordered the small one because because I have a small 7 pound dog. First of all when I pay 30 bucks for a retractable leash I assume it has some length to it since that is kind of the purpose of the retractable. It was a lot shorter than I expected and it is also quite heavy. It also has very strong resistance to pull out the lead. This may be fine for a larger dog, but my small pomeranian cannot pull it out on his own, I have to extend it out and lock it."
4,Great Leash,"This has been my primary leash for over a year. I have a 12 lb. pup and it works great for us. It is ling enough to allow for exploring, but quickly retracts in case of an oncoming dog. It fits easily in my hand and the wrist strap allows me to still use both hands if need be.My only complaint is that the locking mechanism sometimes sticks. And an earlier purchase of the same leash broke after my dog pulled to hard, disabling the retractor. But I loved it so much, I purchased a second!"
3,"Nice, but could be better.","Pros:1. Reflective strap.2. Always retracts to the stop tab (not the clip)3. Easy to lock and unlock the leash with one finger4. Feels and looks sturdy5. I like that it does not retract all the way to the clip. It makes it easier for me to clip it onto my dog's harness.Cons:1. A little heavy for the amount of leash it holds2. Leash is a little short. It would be just as easy for me to wrap a longer, regular leash around my hand and work it manually.3. Tension is a little too much for my 5LB chihuahua. He ends up pulling against it when walking.4. Wrist strap is nice, but I wish it had an adjustable feature on it. I've had it slip off my hand and scared the heck out of my dog. It was not a pretty sight when I was trying to catch him while he was trying to run away from the clattering of the plastic casing. I now twist it after I put it on my wrist to make it snug.Not sure I'd buy this again. It's nice, but maybe for a slightly larger dog."
4,basket is not a complete use-ready item,"Remember that the basket needs special aquatic plant gravel and needs to be lined with some sort of weed blocker paper or fabric, so order that too."
3,From the Board Games Editor at BellaOnline.com,"This game has an appeal that most of the Bratz board games don't. Each player gets a makeover doll and travels around the board getting cosmetics and jewelry to put on the doll. The game comes with actual makeup and stick-on jewelry, as well as real hair accessories, which you really get to put on your doll. It's cute and fun, not highly educational, but more interesting than watching TV. Little girls will enjoy putting the real makeup on their doll and doing their hair and whatnot. Not a bad game, and you get a lot for the price."
4,Birthday gift for granddaughter,I purchased this for my granddaughter who turned 5. She loves Kim Possible so even though the doll doesn't turn cartwheels asdescribed she loves it just because it is KP. She plays the cheers on the megaphone and Kim's arms wave with the pompoms and one of her legs kicks when you press the button on the back of the megaphone.
5,"My 2 year old loves this plane, but I paid less than $10 for it elsewhere","Good sturdy little toy. My 2 year old loves flying it into the ""airplane port"" on the couch. It's fun. I did, however, get it at Kohls for like $9. Not sure I'd pay $25 for it. Disappointing since Amazon is usually a better bargain!"
4,Good but not great,My 12 month old like this toy but only when I pretend it is flying. The quality is great but Toy you can live without.
4,Fun for babies,"I got this for my son right before his 2nd birthday because he LOVES planes. I wish I had gotten this for him earlier. I feel like he would've enjoyed it more a year earlier. It's a great, durable product that we've come to expect from Little People. Fun music, songs. (Love the female pilot!)."
4,Buy this toy cheaper somewhere else!,"This is a great toy and my son loves playing with it, he even pushes the buttons with his finger (instead of putting the little people in those spots) just to hear the sounds and music. It's extremely durable and looks brand new even after he's carried it around and dropped it everywhere. The handle is also a great idea for little hands.My biggest suggestion is to look elsewhere for a better price! I bought this at Wal-mart for him for $[...]!!"
3,less than expected,a lot smaller than I expected- the older versions that my boys have played with were biggerI do like the handleall of the passengers are girls?what's up with the red suitcase?
5,Great Birthday Present,I am a pilot and this made a good gift for my 2 year old nephew. Easy to play with and the sounds are fun. The integrated carrying handle and the fittings for each person to go into make it self-contained without a box.
5,Hit Gift,Our friend's little girl turned one. I bought this for her gift. She loved it instantly. She could hardly wait for it to be opened. It didn't take her long to learn that you push the airplane and how to put the people into the plane. It was definitely a hit for her birthday!
5,My 2 year olds birthday...,"I got this for my 2 year old sons birthday and he loved it we watcher the airplanes and got this to his birthday,the only thing is that it's hard so he could hurt hissel but other than that he loves it so much! Every morning before doing anything he gos to this toyMother of 5"
2,Not very interesting,"I bought this toy for my 16 month old son but he never seemed impressed by it and he never plays with it for more than two minutes! It is very durable though, but I think it does not have any features that would attract kids!"
5,Big hit for Grandson,"This toy was exactly what appealed to my one-year old grandson. He was immediately intrigued by the airplane and the little people inside. This was not a toy he needed to warm up to! He was immediately pushing it around the floor, making it take off (these little ones already know all about air travel!) and getting all the passengers out. Of course he preferred to pitch the little people around the room but he can sometimes enjoy putting them back in their seats. Highly recommended from a grandma who isn't always sure of what the little ones will enjoy."
4,Carbon,"Been using it for years and it seems to do a pretty good job but must be change often, every couple of weeks min."
5,Works Great!!,I use the Fluval FX5 filter for a 125 gallon RES turtle tank. For anyone out there that knows anything about turtles the are messy! With that said since I switched to the FX5 my tank has never been so clean and I don't have to clean the filter nearly as often as any other filter I have used on this tank in the past 4-5 years.
5,Transforming the tragedy of a family suicide into healing,"This is an inspiring book in that it reminds us how in this temporary life, when we encounter tragedy, we can let that lead us to the ultimate lesson that we need to learn while we are here: to connect with our Creator before we die and merge our will with His perfect and beautiful plan. Katie's triumph in this way can be an inspiration not only to those who have lost someone they love to suicide, but also to anyone who has experienced a tragedy...letting their tragedy cause them to re-evalutate life and look at the most important thing in life, which they might not have been inclined to otherwise look at."
2,Halloween Music,"I know what you're thinking. Why not four, five stars? Because it's not perfect! Some of the music is scary, but for the most part I didn't like it. Sure, I love Halloween, but I'm not going to favor it for this review.My suggestion is, if you buy this CD (and you've more than likely seen the movie), visualize the movie in your head while listening to this music, especially the very beginning and basically the end."
2,This sounds like a Goblin Soundtrack,"While I enjoy this soundtrack, it deserves no more than 2 stars because this music was for the most part composed the year before by the Italian prog rock band Goblin for Dario Argento's film Profondo Rosso. Listen to the title track for Halloween and then listen to the title track for Profondo Rosso - The Halloween theme is simply a stripped down version. Still amazing and frightening, but not as original as I once thought."
2,"Good for an overview, but little else","I bought this because all the reviews were good but I've been very disappointed. The book provides an excellent overview that clearly details what BI features SQL Server 2005 has but it does little to actually explain HOW you do things. Yes, I know there are the do by learning sessions but they are pretty basic. I've been trying to implement some standard ETL scenarios with Integration Services and the book has been nearly useless. I can't even get it to explain fundamental concepts such as the distinguishing characteristics between a Data Source and a Connection. Not helpful!"
1,Does not improve ride height loaded or unloaded,"Product does not appear to provide any additional help to the spring. After installing, and seeing the product in person, I don't expect it to do anything. Product sits on one side of Axle, and only presses on 2 points on the OEM spring. (for those less mechanically inclined, try to bend a stick with only 2 fingers touching it, hint...you can't!)The ""loaded"" test was a 200 lbs person standing on the rear bumper. The unit is supposed to be rated for 1,500 lbs. Installed vs not-installed the 200lbs test resulted in the same rear bumper height.For those that would like to ask, yes all bolts fully torqued. And the adjustment rivet (lame excuse for an adjustment) at the maximum setting. Also tried placing the unit fully forward and fully backward on the stock spring, no difference."
3,Enjoyable Game,"I got this game for my husband, who was recovering from surgery and was a bit bored. He enjoyed learning how to ""fish"" with it and it kept him occupied. It really has no true educational value, but he liked playing it to pass the time. A good entertainment game."
5,great product,"It is working awesome so far. I am using it as an external monitor for a Dell Inspiron 8500 laptop whose LCD is almost dead. Monitor has extremely sharp colors and appropriate brightness. Great product.*******Update******A real workhorse, this monitor is turning out to be a great value product."
4,Nice piece for the price,"Excellent daily use as a video game console, browsing the web, watching HDTV. Colors are sharp, fast enough that I don't notice any problem watching HDTV. The catch is if your PC sleeps with a D-Sub connection to the LCD and you turn off the LCD, the LCD will not recognize the signal when your PC wakes up and you turn back on the LCD. You'd need to reboot the PC before you can see anything again. So keep the LCD on no matter what. One more inconvenience is that Analog/Digital signal switching is via on screen menu rather than a dedicated button (like a Dell). It is difficult to switch between two PCs if you have one on the Analog (D-sub) and one on the digital (DVI) connection."
5,"Acer 22"" Monitor",Couldn't be more pleased. Was a nice addition to my other 4 monitor. I trade for a living. The large screen is great for charting.
3,Defective out of box,"I'm sure it's a good product, but mine was defective out of the box. The DVI wouldn't get the video signal after turning off the monitor so i resorted to using the VGA until i returned it a few days ago. Not too much backlight.GOOD:-No dead pixel-ResolutionBAD:-Ultra bright and needs adjustment out of box.-DVI connector defective"
5,Excellent monitor,"I upgraded from a 19"" CRT to this to save space. Does everything that I want it to and at a great price. Play games , watch movies , surf internet!"
5,Absolutely Beautiful,"I can't recall a purchase that i was more happy with than of this screen. absolutely gorgeous and can't beat the price. I'm usually skeptical of no-name brands, but i took a chance and couldn't be happier. easily the most beautiful display i've ever seen"
4,Great value for money,"No dead pixels so far. But one kind of notices that is not a high-quality monitor. when I extended my Sony Vaio into this Monitor, you could clearly see the difference in resolution, brightness, etc. But still, it's very nice, very cheap and very useful. Last problem: you can't turn it, the base is fixed."
5,Excellent buy for the money,I was very impressed with the clarity and sharpness of the picture. An excellent buy.
1,MacUser,"I was very disappointed in this product. It was not plug and play for my Mac. If you like a black screen with white error type, you will love the performance of this monitor. I loved the look of the monitor, but the bottom line is it did not work. It did not come with good instructions. It was difficult to get onto the Acer website to trouble shoot, or register. So, I sadly returned the monitor. This monitor is not Mac compatible, which I read it was. You may need to purchase a new video card 256 mg or bigger, plus purchase a software called ResEdit to make it ""possible"" for the monitor work with a Mac. At that point, it costs too much to keep. I went to several Mac user bulletin boards, and it seems everyone was having the same issues. Acer isn't Mac friendly. : ("
1,Worked for an hour and then PUFF!,"I connected the monitor and an hour later everything went black and I never was able to turn it ON again. I am on a tight spot since the monitor is now outside the United States (long story, don't want to get into the details), so I am not sure if it is more expensive to send it back and ask for a warranty replacement or just lose the money. Basically I am screwed either way. Not sure what the problem was, but I am certain it was not anything electrical since it was connected to a UPS."
5,Great monitor,"This monitor is great for the price. There are no dead pixels and I didn't have issue calibrating the settings. It was bright initially, but I adjusted my video card properly in only a few minutes. It might end up being too bright if you don't have a good video card. I'm really happy with the size! Much larger and nicer than my previous monitors."
2,It's hard to cook a literary soufflé over a campfire.,"Story tension appears only sporadically in this novel and there's no real successful blend of the camp fire horror and coming of age genres. There's a long smoldering buildup to a payoff that's neither as scary nor gory as it should be. An attempt really at a Stephen King tale, this Cook gives us what might have worked in the 50s in terms of sex and thrills (and imagery like the hero always having to use a crutch), but doesn't work now. There's a hint at a real exposure of some interesting unconscious motives of the hero but that too is underdeveloped and falls flat. It's hard to cook a literary soufflé over a campfire.Book purchased used from an Amazon-listed dealer."
5,"Target Customer ""April""",I have used this book many times for personal use as well as a teaching tool. Very easy to understand and apply! I have also purchased this item as gifts for friends who have told me how much they enjoy it.
4,Not quite worth 5 stars,"Frazetta continues on in his fine tradition of lush fantasy/sci-fi art, but falls short of the mark in this effort. There are some fine gripping works in this volume like the first and second, but some of them are starting to look tired and uninspiring. Could it be that Frazetta's commercial success is now affecting his talent? Still a must have for Frazetta fans though."
1,How sad!,"Peter Cincotti's first two albums are some of my all time favories and his concert video is fabulous, but now this? In a sincere effort to be fair, I forced myself to play it a second time, but couldn't stand it long enough to make it all the way through. I waited many months after hearing it before I could bring myself to write this review.Why Peter? Why does someone with your obvious talent who brings such a fresh breath of youthful style and grace in jazz record an album that is so totally lacking in either? How sad. Please don't let the mess that this album is signal the end of a promising future. If this is an effort to ""find yourself"", this definitely isn't it. Look over your shoulder. You were already there fresh out of the box. As a sincere fan, I'm severely disappointed. You used to have it in spades. Back up, Peter and try again."
2,"Only good for long, boring trips","Ok, maybe I would enjoy this book more if I was reading the printed version instead of listening to awful accents and terrible 'acting' but this is really pretty terrible. All the 'twists and turns' are incredibly predictable. Instead of making the readers feel suspense over who is the villain, we are told outright. And we are told everything that the villain is thinking and doing. As if I couldn't figure out already that the witness to a crime was phony, the author goes ahead and confirms it, almost with a damn drum-roll as if we should be incredibly impressed with how clever he was. I suppose the only real suspense comes from wondering if the heroine will figure out in time to save herself, her baby, and her remaining friends. Oh no!! <cue corny acting> Seriously, don't waste your money."
2,this is what i think of this book.,"i havent finished reading this book yet but, i am on page 50 and they only spent 2 or 3 pages talking about the bodies they found. The other 48 pages were about al capone and cleveland and eliot ness. I think they should of spent more time on the actual crimes and not on al capone."
4,pretty good stuff,This seems to work pretty good. I've been using it for a number of years. I wish it would last longer.
5,For Budding Desert Rats,"I am generally somewhat partisan towards hiking in mountains and among forests but every now and again, especially during the Spring after a good rainy season, I like to go to the desert and see the (sometimes) spectacular flower bloom. Anza-Borrego State Park is a great place for this sort of activity and this edition of ""Best Easy Dayhikes"" is a nice guide to the hiking alternatives in the area.This book is actually an exerpt from a much larger Falcon Press book, 'Hiking California's Desert Parks' by the same authors. As with other books in the 'Best Easy Dayhikes' series, the focus here is on short walks with relatively minimal elevation gains. In this the authors do an excellent job. Only three of the twenty hikes exceed 3 miles in length. Many are less than a mile. And all of the trails I took from this guide were delightful. It's almost enough to tempt me into spending more time in the desert."
2,Replacement batteries?,"One thing I've learned to watch out for with Linksys is the batteriesthey use in such units. I can not find a part number for thebattery used by the WIP330 in any of their literature,and there is not a battery product listed on Linksys's own web site. If this turnsout to be like the DPH540 before it, Linksys actually intends for you tothrow the unit away when the battery stops taking a charge."
4,Wonderful film and sountrack!,"This was such an amazing movie. I've been searching for the soundtrack for a long time. While the musical score is beautiful, I too was disappointed to discover that Bette Midler's wonderful song was nowhere to be found on it."
5,"Good drive, easy install","I bought this drive to replace a smaller, slower drive. I installed the new drive as master and the old one as a slave, and rebooted using the included Data Lifeguard software. Formatting and partitioning was a snap, and there's a utility for copying the contents of one partition to another. Once that was done I could boot off of the new drive and not have to re-load any software.The only quibbles I have: The drive didn't come with spacers/rails to fit a 3.5"" device in a 5.25"" slot, so I had to make a trip to the store for that. Also, copying the partition took about 4.5 hours for 14.3 GB. My PC is an HP Pavilion w/ 1.2 gHz. Athlon and 512 MB RAM."
1,Stay away from this drive,"Please be advised to stay away from this drive. I have lost very important work as it crashed, replaced with another and it crashed again. Please be aware Fudjitsu Pc's use these drives so if you have one please change it before you start developing problems.Very poor."
3,Scarred Lands dont transplant,"This book is of good value if you are running a Scarred Lands game. But I find the information to be so specific that it wont make a easy fit to other settings.There are plenty of feats and prestige classes to keep every one happy, as well as some new ideas about cabals and sorcerer tradtions (blood lines)"
1,Listening to Billy is worse than a root canal....,"Who cares about the guy who got third in Canadian Idol last year?Billy was awesome back in the day of Kovered in Lies, but now he is derivative pile of dung. His cd offers nothing interesting -- and it has all the attitude of John Lithgow's latest collection of children's songs. Last night while i was listening to this cd i had an inescapable urge to kill myself. we should hunt down Billy and give him a good kick in the c ock."
5,"Billy Klippert: In my heart, he came in first!","This is such a great CD, I would recommend it to anyone! All of the songs are sang with a great voice, and a touch of individual talent. GO AND GET THIS CD!"
4,"Finally, something goog has come out of a stupid tv show!","Well, I had given up hope of really discovering or liking anything that comes out of ridiculous tv shows, like Canadian Idol. I was mistaken. Billy's Cd is great: a good solid rock Cd in the tradition of other great Canadian rock bands like Our Lady Peace, Moist and so on. Well worth buying if you want a real good rock cd and if you're tired of hearing ultra similar pop music..."
4,Buy this book as a gift and you will want it for yourself,"I bought this book for a college student away from home for the first time and she loved it. So I ordered a copy for my brother too. After looking at it I wouldn't mind a copy myself.It has many practical easy recipes, great information on food storage and preparation as well as valuable laundry tips. This book is a great gift for anyone living on their own even if they have been doing it for awhile."
3,Good flashback to the great movie...,"If you've seen the movie (and I guess you have, otherwise you wouldn't buy the soundtrack..) some tracks create a good flashback. But others are a bit out of context.. All in all a nice CD, but sometimes they miss the pictures to go with them."
5,I feel French ;),"An excellent suspenseful soundtrack that accurately portrays the darkness of the movie. By the way, the piece the others are referring to is not Celine Dion and is not on Sogno but rather is Sarah Brightman with Andrea Bocelli and really is incidental to the rest of the movie and to the soundtrack."
5,understanding the credit system,I have been in the mortgage business for 20 years and this is the most informative book I have ever read on how the credit scoring system works. I am incorporating his strategies for my mortgage clients to help them qualify for lower interest rates.....Gerry
3,FYI,"Just to let everyone know. If you go onto any website that sells this book, you will find the same customer reviews verbatim. I own the book and it's OK, but not as great as the 5 star customer reviews would lead you to believe."
3,Not All That!,This book is for someone that doesn't know anything about trying to repair credit. I didn't learn anything new and I think that the purchase was a waste of money.
5,Worth every penny!!!,"For a couple of reasons, I conducted a lengthy search both online and in bookstores for a solid book on credit scoring and repair. First, I am a mortgage banker and have a desire to HELP my credit-challenged clients, not just tell them their score and turn them away to some hard-money lender who will only make matters worse for them. Secondly, I desired to boost my own score and remove some derogatory items (some true, some false). There are so many books you can buy, but I ultimately chose Bestcredit, and suggest you do the same. You'll likely come away feeling as armed and empowered as I do."
1,Misleading,"Very hard to work, and way to much down time, to have to screw on the adapters everytime after you launch it is just ridiculous. Also, it doesn't launch half of the time. INCREDIBLY MISLEADING AD ON TV!"
4,Stainless Steel Cake Pan,"The baking pan was for a friend. She's used it once with good results --- non-stick, glossy surface easy to clean with little fear of scratching the surface as would happen with aluminum. The wide lip at the top of the pan makes for easy handling. The metal is thick enough and sturdy. Eliminates the fear of ingesting artificial non-stick or aluminum surfaces in baked foods. Ideally the pan should be about 1/2 to 1 inch deeper for the conventional American cake size."
5,"Stainless Steel Bakeware - 9"" Round cake pan","I love stainless steel bakeware. I don't like using anything else. It is well made, bakes evenly, and cleans easily."
5,Right on time haven't had no problem,"Well title says it all, it shipped on time and parts fit. It's been a couple of months and haven't had no issue.(I wouldn't expect to either way)"
3,I thought it was new.,It might have been a mistake on my part but I thought I was buying a new book. The book is in very good condition but it has been highlighted in several places so it is obviously not new.
5,Fantastic Book!!!,"I can not remember now how many times I have referenced this book in the past. John Kotter hits the mark perfectly with this easy to read highly applicable book that will help any person dealing with or leading change. I have used the principles in the book to lead changes in my company, projects I have worked on, in my church, and even in my family. This book is a must read!"
4,A useful book for a changing world of business,"""Change is the only permanent thing"" has become an extremely popular idea and everybody's talking about it everywhere. The difference with this book is that - unlike other authors - John P. Kotter systematizes the analysis of change inside organizations and he succeeds almost a 100%. I say almost a 100% because I think ""Leading change"" emphasyses a little bit more on ""what"" to do in order to face changes than on ""how"" to implement changes. Yes, I know that every company is a different world by itself and that many possible ways of implementation do exist, but in my humble oppinion this book should have had 20-30 more pages in order to explore in more detail this crucial aspect of change. Anyway it is an enlightening book on the topic."
4,Leading Change: A good fit for any size company,"I was initially concerned of the applicability of the work on a smaller-sized company. Even though some references are made regarding layers of organization, most of the ideas can be applied to almost any company. I've listened many times and will glean new thoughts and ideas with each review. This work is a very comprehensive study on the subject.I have since purchased 4 sets of the CDs and to give as gifts to those inside and outside of our organization who we know will appreciate it."
1,Arrived broken and had to be returned and I had to pay for shippijng..,"Arrived broken and had to be returned and I had to pay for shippijng.. poorly constructed and cheap.did not appear to be made for use outside, purely decorative."
1,0 Stars DON'T BUY THIS!!!,"DON'T BUY THIS!!! Instead of relying on the good reviews, I should have paid more attention to the one about the fried iPod. No mention or evidence of the ""safety fuse"" anywhere. Why is this not just installed at the factory? How stupid can they be?? I spent $16.00 plus shipping (!) on this **** for my son. It turned red hot and ruined his $300 iPod. DON'T BUY THIS!!!"
4,Nice Design,"Works well and the retractable cord tidys up the cord clutter. The plug slips out of my auto charger though (cigarette lighter), you have to make sure that the plug is in tight and that the iPod is actually charging."
5,Nutrition,Arrived in a timely manner and worked great. did go to the website to download the manual as thenumber codes for food was small. But donloaded printed and happy now
5,I love this scale!,"I was a little worried about ordering a scale online without looking at it, but I really love this scale. The key book, with all the ingredients, that come with it is wonderful. I use the scale to weight everything, including cat food since my cat is on a diet too. I've already lost 9 pounds using this scale to watch my calorie intake."
1,Saving My Money,"I've also heard Jody live and in person and have his first cd. After listening to the 4-samples, I'm saving my money... this is horrible! He is so great live and in person and to listen to this slow, plodding cd... forget it! What a disappointment. He should stay with his live band and forget these deadbeat side players. Go with the bass, drums and guitar. Unto thyself be true. Sorry Jody."
4,Story is good but becoming predictable,"This is the third time that JLB has tackled the same type of story: a old murder, an old acquaintance, an old girlfriend and a boyhood friend (who is on the wrong side of the law).The old murder involves the killing of a NAACP civil rights activist forty years ago by a KKK racist. The old acquaintance is an ex-vietnam marine (sound familiar) who became successful (came from the right side of the tracks) and is now running for Governor. The ex-girlfriend is now the politicians wife who has never forgiven Dave for dumping her. The old boyhood friend is a 'made-man' who has been playing both sides for a while and is now in trouble with everyone.Needless to say the bad-guys get their cumuppence and the good guys win, but as always there is some collateral damage to someone near Dave. His old friend and bait shop buddy, Batist, gets stuck between a rock and a hard place, but thankfully survives."
3,Thought provoking for the converted only,"Kelley is on track as he attempts to lift benevolence to the status of a major virtue in the Objectivist ethics, but unless familiar with the inner-workings of Rand's philosophy, the layman will likely be overwhelmed by unfamiliar references to Rand's work. That said, Kelley's calm approach to reason is a pleasure to read as usual.For Objectivists only; I hope some day we begin to see some authors that go the rest of the distance by communicating such ideas to the philosophical lay-person."
1,PIECE OF JUNK!!!!,After second use this Wahl Pro Senior simply died and i was left in the middle of an haircut with a piece of junk in my hands!!! Luckly i had my wahl Peanut that finished the job!! I would never purchase from this seller again! Very poor customer service!!
5,Superlative,"What a totally riveting read. I barely could put it down for a break. The suspense and plot were continuous.Just marvelous. The general theme concerned the role of The Church during WWII. A new more liberal Pope has now been elected and he is strongly resisted by an ultra conservative group within The Church called the Crux Vera. The reader is treated to the development of many fine characters,two of the best being Gabriel Allon,art restorer and Mossad agent, and Eric Lange--a hired assassin. Be prepared for a great trip as you read this."
5,Fantastic Read!,Have been a fan of his previous works ... but this one blew me away. Could not put it down. A wonderful tale that pulls you in and won't let go. Didn't want it to end. Highly recommended.
2,A wannabe Dan Brown's plot,I thought this dude was a better writer.I loved the Messenger. But I am in total zzz-land with The Confessor. The plot is a quasi-clone of Dan Brown's `The Da Vinci Code'....Boooooooooooringgggggggg!How easy it has become to target the Catholic Church with this type of idiotic 'conspiracy theories'... I am so tired of these pseudo-historians
1,Birkenstock,The description of the shoes indicated they were ideal for feet with low arches. The reviews raved over the fit. I found however that the shoes are extremely hard and they don't stay on as indicated. Never did get any softer nor fit my feet.Not pleased at all.
1,Stop Pinching Yourself,"This is another example of what might be called ""esoteric Buddhism."" We can expect more of this kind of writing, not less, as we Westerners actually learn to work with the mind. McKenna manifests the 19th and 20th century specter of a Western ""genius,"" once rare, but now common. This concept of genius is already out-of-date.Having the good fortune to meet and spend time with the Dalai Lama, the 17th Gyalwa Karmapa (Ogyen Trinley Dorje), and other great Tibetan rinpoches, I learned from them that the sign of a real teacher is not their ability to appear profound and powerful, but that in their presence I experience my own essential nature. In other words: not something more about them, but something about the true nature of the mind.McKenna may appear wrathful and scary, but this is nothing. What he writes is healthy, but it only takes a few sentences to get the idea."
1,Where is the Musical Talent?,"I have been a fan of Joey's for years, but even I can not rate this cd high. He may be hot... but hotness alone can not guarentee talent. The only song that I cared for was California... Sorry Joe... but it's your previous fame that's selling your records not your talent."
5,WOW what a shocker,"WOW reading thru all the neg feed back... all i can say is to each there own and you would have to listen to it your self to decide if you love or hate it. there dosent seem to be an inbetween with 8:09.I however am one that cant get it out of my cd player...I really enjoy the beat to dance like that. Someday is sweet. Endlessly was Wonderful Live on ""ONE TOO MANY"" and is still wonderful on the studio version.Take the time to hear the cd for your self before you let what others write judge how you feel.Its a Much Different CD that Joe usualy puts out but it IMO is Very Good, For those of you who Love Eman too... On Dance like that you will hear the Greek influance provided by him. Also Joe remakes Falling off of Emans CD ""Favorit Enemy"" I strongly recomend that cd also."
1,What happened here?????,"That's really all I can say! This CD is a total waste of time! This CD is the KING of cheese!! Even the truest of fans have to admit this!! Please, don't waste the time it would take to go to the store to get it!!!!!!!!!"
1,Very bad experience with this produce,"This steamer was rickety when assembled. It got too hot to touch -- even on the handle. Finally, after only about five or six uses, it refused to turn on. Trying to contact the company is a nightmare: their 800 number is always busy, and they have no e-mail capability. I'd advise going with another brand."
3,never leave it plugged in,"I have had my steamer for several years and use it quite often. Yes the handle does get hot and it will drip water if you don't keep the hose drained of condensation, but my latest experience is a bit scary. Once previously the unit turned on after a power outage and fortunately was discovered quickly when the power returned. Last night I awakened at 3:15 a.m. to a popping sound and realized that the steamer had turned on, steamed up the bedroom and was almost out of water. My fault for leaving it plugged in but I am not sure what would have happened if no one had been around. Theoretically the auto shut-off would have kicked in when it ran dry, but theoretically it should not auto turn-on! I will be looking for a replacement soon. My experience with the quality of the Euro-Pro products has not been positive so I will look elsewhere."
4,Nice compact surge protector,"I've had good luck with Cyberpower surge protectors so when I needed a nice compact one for my laptop, I went with this one. I like that it includes adapters for both 2-prong and 3-prong so that it works with either of my laptops, although I'm a bit confused by the 3 prong one as the cord already has a 3-prong on it, and the 3-prong adapter only plugs into the 2-prong adapter so you have to use both to even use it. So not sure why you would do that when you can just plug it directly into a 3-prong power box. The 500 joules it is rated for is a bit lower than the comparable APC product (600 joules) and the design is a tad bulkier as well. But overall, very happy with the product and would definitely recommend it."
3,Decent fast black metal,"Well, this album isn't bad at all, but it isn't great. The drums on some songs hit hard and on others are paper thin, due to the different recording dates. The guitars are easily the best I have heard on a black metal cd to date. I recommend ""The Last Supper"" more than this because the growl voice is used more frequently. Overall, the best purchase under $8 I have ever made."
1,"WRONG, WRONG, WRONG","Several years ago I'd heard an absolutely wonderful LP with this title, and this wasn't it. What a disappointment! It was like finding out there were two versions of Sergeant Pepper--one by the Beatles and one by Lothar and the Hand People or something--and finding I hadn't ordered the one by the Beatles. WHO KNEW??The one I was looking for wasButterfly Ball & the Grasshopper's Feastby Rod Edwards and Roger Hand with narration by Judi Dench and Michael Hordern. Thankfully I realized the error and now have the correct version, which is taken almost verbatim from the book. This version is pure magic, and I'm overjoyed to see it back in circulation after more than 20 years.And get the book!The Butterfly Ball and the Grasshopper's FeastAlan Aldridge's illustrations are gorgeous, and browsing through the book as you listen to the CD is a wonderful way to spend a Sunday afternoon teatime."
5,Great product,"I have used this off and on a few times and I always see results. Don't expect a miracle, and do give yourself about a month before you expect results. After a month you will see nice definition evolving if you use this combined with exercise and a sensible diet."
1,Horrible,"A pseudo-operatic rendition of greek popular songs. Try Nana Mouskouri's early recordings of some of them and you'll see what I mean. The interpetation is pretentious and kitschy. The voice reminds us of one of those drawing room ""recitals"", with the bourgeois parents listening proudly to their daughter's efforts in serious music."
4,Mommy Dearest!,"Great story, first book, good job. I just couldn't put it down, you really can get caught up in this book. I passed it on to more than one person. I hope your next books are just as good. We really need some new blood."
5,Children,This is a very good book. The scenes are so vivid. One minute I laughed and the next shook my head because of the sadness. This should be on your must read list.
1,Huh??,"What happened to the original cover picture for this book. You know the one with the beautiful ""DARK"" child. So what is the author OR her publisher trying to say really??I gave 1 star simply because of the new cover-- the book itself was an exellent read."
5,This book is amazing!!!,"The Darkest Child is a hard and fast look at mental illness and its effects on those around you. The book made me analyze religion, beliefs, and family as I turned from page to page. At points I had to put the book down because the imagery was so overwhelming, but soon thereafter I'd have to pick the book back up because I needed to know what happened next. This book is well written and kept me engaged from beginning to end."
2,Dead Beat by Mc Dermid.,Found this a bit ho hum. Kept waiting for something to happen but unfortunately nothing actually did. Shame as Val can be so good.
3,A new author,Val McDermid's Kate Brannigan stories were recommended as good reads on a bus encounter. I enjoyed this one enough to seek out more by the author.
3,"Not too terrible, but not her best work.","Compared to her other series, this one just isn't as good. I wouldn't spend my $$ on it. And really??? I have to write a minimum of words to rate this book???"
3,Focuses Too Much on the American Role in the Cuban Rev.,"This is a thorough, well-researched, ubiased work, yet it is terribly one-sided. Paterson describes the events of the Cuban Revolution only within the context of United States involvement. He fails to acknowledge or highlight important social movements occurring within Cuba during the revolutionary period. ""Contesting Castro"" offers particularly insightful analysis into the American role during events of the Sierra Maestra campaign (1956-59), but lacks an in depth discussion of the periods preceeding or following the triumph the July 26 Movement. Nevertheless, Patterson's work is a fine account of American-Cuban relations during the Cuban Revolution."
5,Wonderful Support & Validation!,"This is the first book on pet loss I've found that is actually a support group on paper! The letters from people all over the world are so touching and soul-baring, it's amazing that writing a letter like this can help heal a person, but I've done it now, and it does help. Before I read this book, I didn't feel ready to actually talk about my feelings to other people. I know there are support groups for people who have lost a pet, although few and far between, but somehow voicing my innermost feelings and crying in front of people wasn't something I felt comfortable doing. Now that Laura (I feel like I can be on a first-name basis with this author!) explained ways to process the myriad of feelings that accompany losing a pet, and the letters have made me feel like there are people who really do understand how devastating this kind of loss can be, I feel ready to move along the path of healing. THANK YOU!"
1,when money looks good..... (and albums sound bad),"say goodbye to the girl in the housedress.Lori Mckenna is a visionary songwriter, and she has proved that on her previous albums. She previously refused to be boxed in, and perfectly teetered the lines between indie rock and country. She was unapologetic about her husband being a plumber. Now that all of the nasville over-producion team have come in and ruined her, i doubt that she will struggle to be a housewife in the kitchen.BITTERTOWN was fresh and honest- it was raw and real. the new record is sterile, to be polite. thank you nashville, again."
1,Worse thing ever,I payed over $60 for the set. The salt mill works fine. The pepper mill broke after the 1st use. The gears or something inside broke causing the motor not to grind the pepper. I am going to try to get a replacement but I don't know if that is going to solve anything. I had bought this set to replace a different brand which had the exact same problem. It worked great for the salt but the peppermill broke the same way after about 3 uses. I would recommend the salt mill but not the peppermill.
4,Great book to start out with!,"I like the illustrations, though I wish it had much more. This is a nice little primer book for those who are interested in the subject to get a sniff and see if they really want to know more. Good material, and a simple read."
2,Not for me,This book might be helpful for people who need help in developing critical thinking and taking a more objective view of life. But I think it would be rather banal for people who have already developed these traits.
5,great price,"The book was in 100% shape, and the sender was fast, the content of the book is o.k. but required by my instructor, overall a fair product."
5,this book is too cool,"This girl named nadia from new york is treated differently by her midwestern classmates who are too different from her. So when she gets a genie of her own and wants to be popular she gets her clothes custom made and starts wearing colourful clothes and barrettes as opposed to wearing black and joins the school paper and makes friends with the popular girls. But then she has to choose between the geeks and the popular ones and circumstances make it hard. Finally nadia decides who she likes when she learns the hard way that some of them tried to set her up and since then she started dressing like herself again though with much more colour and all the while nadia and her genie enjoyed chats, girl talk, pizza and dancing to madonna music. Nice read"
4,Great Book!,"I was not impressed with my instructor for this course, so I had to rely heavily on the book to teach myself the subject. It is very well written, with plenty of appropriate examples and exercises. I really like that Lay puts a couple of practice problems before the actual exercises--I used these as a test of whether or not I needed to re-read the section before doing the h/w. I liked the study guide, but the ""see the text"" responses and failing to answer T/F questions was absolutely annoying (although I saw Lay's purpose b/c I did learn more by looking it up, it was just time-consuming). The practice tests were helpful, although quite difficult. Make sure you buy a copy that still has the CD-ROM (with the study guide). Another tip is to go to Dr. Lay's website at the University of MD to view any handouts/info he gives his studs. I highly recommend the book."
4,It is generally good for the price,"The book is worth the money I spent on it. Some pages of the book have a old-book weird smell, but it is bearable. After a while, the smell goes away. It has some markings on it. Since it is so cheap, I think it is really worth the money. After all, text book is not cheap."
2,Not very durable,"Serves it's purpose, but don't fill it all of the way- The material is really not durable enough for a full hamper's worth of weight. There are several holes in mine already. Also, the base it attaches to is not very sturdy."
3,Night Autopsy Room,"This is a good book. It is the story of a Japanese medical student, who, just after World War II, meets and talks with 7 different spirits, who have died in different ways. I loved learning more of the Japanese culture, and sad to learn how terrible World War II was on the Japanese. There are, however, some short comings to the book. This book was translated from Japanese to English, and there are some places where the interpretation was off, and/or several clerical errors were noted.The book does become *wordy* at times, and three of the stories, of the seven, tend to tell close to the same thing in their stories. I do recommend the reading of the book. It was enjoyable to read, and learning more of the culture was rewarding. - Debi Hoggan, Utah"
4,Nice Inside Look,"I have an interest in one day making indie games, so clearly I was pretty excited to see this documentary, a behind the scenes look at the stresses that go into producing independent video games. I was initially hoping for an in-depth look at the process, from software to release, but this film is really just about the people. I felt a bit slighted in the beginning, but the film turned out to be more than enough for me. I really enjoyed it. This film really put into perspective many of the misconceptions of the indie market, specifically, that it really isn't that easy to produce a great game."
4,"I liked it, my girlfriend didn't...","After all the rave reviews for this movie, I was expecting to absolutely love it. I am 34 years old, and have been a gamer all of my life. While I enjoyed the movie, I did not find it to be as deserving of all the buzz it's getting around the internet. You basically get to watch two indie game developers struggle through the development process, and see one of the two games actually get released. Very cool for us video game geeks, but not so great for someone that doesn't understand video games. My girlfriend is an engineer, and loves technology. Yet she was frequently asking me questions during the movie, and in the end told me she was frustrated by terminology she couldn't understand and lost interest half way through. Bottom line? If you're a moderate to hardcore gamer, and interested in the industry you will enjoy it. But this is not a movie that's going to convert any non-gamers into gamers. And it's definitely not a date movie. I should have known better."
1,Compressed Sounding,"The music on this cd sounds like it was compressed on most of the songs. There is no deep bass line on it at all, the way Jimmy Smith played. It also sounds like this performance was rushed through."
2,Poor quality,"The audio quality is poor, some annoying background noise. Not sure why but it's clearly worse once I ripped them (digital and converting to 160kbps MP3s in iTunes). Now it's still clearly noticeable when playing from the CDs (using the computer).It's not only the audio quality that's poor, it's also clearly a low budget for the prodcution using only one female and one male voice even though the dialogues often have two female or male actors. A couple chinese teacher could probably spend a day or two producing the entire series using just two microphones and computer with CD burner. Amazing that this is supposed to be the most widely used text book in US."
3,Not quite IT.,"Some good things:- cost - good- build - built solidly- motor can power through thick oak.Some not so good things- Adjusting the blade guides is a total pain - to move the lower guides requies tipping the table up and jamming your hand underneath to loosen the hex bolts.- Raising the cutting height, even 2-3 "", causes you to need to readjust all the guides.- Tightening the guides changes their settings - need to guess to get it right."
1,Horrible,"This was my first R. Rogers book that I have read. I thouhgt that the book was horrible. The whole book centered around rape and abuse. I felt absolutely terrible after reading this book. I have another one of her books to read ""A Reckless Encounter,"" and I do hope that it is much better. I do not recommend this book to anyone."
1,You should read this book if you enjoy rape.,"I was just simply horrified by this book, though I couldn't stop reading it in hopes that this morbid story would change, but it never did. I never knew it was possible for one woman to be raped by so many different men in so many different countries. And the person who rapes the heroine, Marisa, the most is the so-called hero, Dominic. Dominic has no depth and the story never really says why he can mange to be nice to everyone else except Marisa. I just can't comprehend how she manages to fall in love with him in the end without him showing the least bit of regret or change of ways."
5,I loved this book!,I have read most of Rosemary Rogers booksand I really loved this one. Reading is supposedto transport you to another time and place and put you in situations you would never live through yourself. It's fun to be swept away byvillians and pirates. Keep writing RosemaryI'll read every book you write!
1,Dead on arrival,"I received this in a beat up box. After installation and it didn't work, I had it test and it was defective."
3,3 stars,"The descriptions in the book are lengthy. As you are probably not aware, learning the definitions in law are a huge part of the battle. This book provides pages and pages of additional information, but only a paragraph to define a particular subject matter."
4,for science or engineering readers,"With all the noise about chaos and chaotic phenomena, Williams sets out to dispel the confusion. Powerful maths ideas are explained with enough rigour to satisfy most readers. But this is primarily not a maths text. I started reading it thinking it was, and then realised otherwise.The ideas are not developed in a traditional maths way, with scads of theorems, lemmas and corrolaries. The exposition deliberately mimics what you are likely to see in a physics or engineering book. With a level of detail sufficient for that readership.The main ideas covered involve fractals. How to define and measure such things as the fractal dimension of a curve or surface. Which leads into attractors and basins of attraction. Finally, the book ties chaos into related ideas from information theory; enriching an understanding of both fields."
2,pathetic,as a huge fan of gardening essays i was pumped about this book. what a HUGE let down. I did read the marigold story first which I found to be disgusting.Was thinking i might give this book as a gift. So glad I read it first.would have been embarrased.There were some good stories but the book could not recover from Marigold story. What does ringworm have to do with Marigolds.
2,large smurf house,Ordered this for my 5yr old daughter and from the others to choose I thought it was larger and when it came it looks just like the smaller version that they have for sale.It's too small and not worth the money
1,Falls apart easily,"It comes in a box with many parts to put together. The windows have 4 parts to each window, they don't stay together and when playing with the house the windows, roof and door are constantly falling apart."
2,Please enter a title for your review,"Take the math crunch attack of Dillinger Escape Plan's Calculating Infinity, add the driving dissonant experimentalism of Botch's We Are The Romans, a dash of Isis' doomy chord ringouts, and the dullest most commercial moments of Poison The Well. Add water until every aspect of what made those bands' material effective and compelling is lost, and you've got this album."
1,Worst crap ever,"They really could have done something with that game, put in a better engine, less damn collisions between wrestlers.That game is a disgrace and the ones that followed where even worst imagine.The wrestlers look very good, the roster is amazing, but when you play the game it just doesnt feel right, you dont feel in control of your wrestlers, and to many glitch in the game make is Yuke.The best wrestling game right now is still WWE Bring on the pain.Its is not a pleasure for me to bring down a wrestling game like i am doing right now, and to tell you the thruth i add high hopes when they introduced this one, they said a new engine etc etc, i was really hoping to get something like NO WAY OUT on the N64 but i just didnt.Sad i am still very much a fan of wrestling and even more a fan to the 80 wrestling."
3,Improved Legends of Wrestling,"Good StuffGraphics: Improved graphicsNew Wrestlers: DDP, Dusty Rhodes,Jake ""The Snake"" Roberts, Sting, Ultimate Warrior, and Randy ""Macho Man"" SavageSounds: Finally comentary, by the guys from WCW and Bobby ""The Brain"" HenanStoryline: Wrestle wrestlers in each era (70's, 80's, 90's, and today)Extra Stuff: Play classic matches like Hulk Hogan vs. Andre The GiantBad StuffGraphics: Didn't improve enoughSound: Commentaters repeat lines"
4,Oh yes... YES!,"No point in attempting to articulate the relative merits and demerits of this aural experience to you.Suffice to say that if you have not wandered in uninvited from elsewhere i.e. you have consciously found yourself at this page and you don't presently own this CD, then after asking yourself 'Why not?' you need to run off and get your credit card - buy this as fast as you can.If you died without listening to this CD even once, that would be an utter travesty and something you would regret for eternity. Something which could preoccupy the thoughts of Man as he sat in-line waiting to be called for Divine Judgement; a time which is supposed to be given over to contemplating one's mortality - not one's mistaken CD purchases or lack thereof."
2,It'll work in a pinch,"The one I got doesn't adjust very well, the screws jam up before the ligature is snug. Maybe I got a bad one?"
2,Definitely not a step by step beginners guide,"This book fails to relay the required learning material to the reader in a step by step approach, instead the book largely reads like a novel, and often at times you may find yourself just trying to keep your finger on the page to allow an idea of where you're up to. The author seems to be so caught up in the examples included, the reader must wonder at times if the book is a manual for the included examples, or an actual learning tool to understand Access. The author often requests the reader to complete a task then realizes three or four pages later that he's forgotten to explain how! On the positive side, the book is totally complete in its content, although definitely not aimed at the absolute beginner."
1,"There's no There, There","If you are looking for ambigous answers to your work related questions on Access 97. This is the book for you, however if you are looking for real world answers to your real life Access 97 questions, avoid this book. This book has the problem that all Microsoft Press books suffer from the examples are ridiculously simple, but don't neccessarily apply to your difficult questions. Every time I consult this tome from Microsoft looking for an answer I come away more dazed and confused than ever and I am no beginner to databases. In the words of Robert Benchley, ""it is not a book to be tossed aside lightly, you have to use great force"". Save your money."
3,I want to stop reading it and learn Access!,"I've started this book many times. It gets you going and then goes off on a tangent. By the time I get back to the subject at hand I have forgotten what I read. It is not a step by step and the examples are off world. All I want is a book that will take me from beginning to end in detail starting small and working up to big with examples that make sense. This book uses examples in the beginning that should be in the end. I know there is something better out there. I am quite computer literate and I've taught myself many programs with books like this, but they were sensible."
4,Not bad,I had little expectations for this box. It is exactly how it was described. The hinges aren't as strong as you'd like but it gets the job done. If I had to do it all over again I would
2,"That old mule, Old Rivers and me.","Walter Brennan was a famous character actor who appeared in several movies and TV shows. In the early 1960s, he was starring in the hit TV show The Real McCoys. Somehow, somebody got the bright idea of making him a recording artist, even though he was in his 60s at the time and he couldn't sing at all. They got around his lack of singing ability by having him ""talk"" the lyrics to his songs. He actually managed to have a few hit songs, with ""Old Rivers"" being the biggest hit, reaching #5 on the Hot 100. The subsequent Old Rivers album featured nine other songs in a similar vein, mostly folksy ruminations about farmers. ""Old Rivers"" is actually kind of touching, but the rest of the album is pretty corny. As for his Christmas album, it's much worse. Actually, it's pretty much more of the same, only with a Christmas theme. But if you like hearing ""down home wisdom"", you may enjoy it."
2,Buy A Microscope With It,"I bought it thinking that logo designing would be fun. And it was until when I looked at the final product the logo was a tiny pixalated mess! As far as I know, there's no way to make it any bigger, and my disapointment began to set in."
1,Just plain awful,"Oh, I am so sorry that you lost digits in an industrial accident. I was going to ask you to count on your fingers the GOOD books you have seen wriiten FROM a movie. Maybe you can still do it, because this book won't be on your list.Wordy, plain, flaccid, vapid, artless... Who in the world hired this done?If you INSIST on reading a copy, get one through your library, and donate the difference to charity!"
4,its one important piece of your security setup,"I have been using this product for over 2 years, and have not been hacked yet.Build your defense in layers: firewall, antivirus, and if you are on a cable or DSL- add a NAT router (such as a Linksys). Otherwise, you're just fooling yourself.REMEMBER- this is NOT antivirus software- its a firewallMost complaints I see here are people who expect the wrong things: zonealarm will ask permission to grant programs internet access- if you say ""yes"" when you shouldn't, whose fault is that? Know what you have, and what it does. If you aren't sure, say ""no"", and see if that breaks something. You can always change your mind later.Understand what this does, and don't expect miracles. It's one part of a secure PC, but not the whole picture."
3,Stick with the free version - The price is right,I installed the 60 day trial of ZoneAlarm Pro 3 shortly after getting a constant broadband connection. I was amazed at the number of times I was being pinged and such. I was amazed at how big the log was on intrusions after just a couple of days. While the software worked without a problem on my HP PIII 1.1 Ghz Win-XP laptop I could not get it to run on a new E-Machines 1.2 GHz Celeron system running Win-XP. It caused all types of havoc on that system. I installed a router with a firewall and am running the free version of Zone Alarm on both systems without problems now. My suggestion is to take the money you would spend on this and by a inexpensive router with a NAT firewall (D-Link DI-604 works well) instead and then run the free version for extra safety. ...
3,"Keep that wallet open, you might need it","I don't have a problem with the way Zonealarm functions. It seems to work fine after some minor configuring. I won't access the internet without it. But a month after I bought Zonealarm 2 (download from their web site), they started bugging me to upgrade to version 3. I was annoyed that they didn't sell me version 3 to begin with but finally agreed. About a year later, my ""subscription"" to updates expired and now I get occasional pop-up windows, asking me to renew. I don't know about you but I'm not going to pay extra to subscribe to anything. If there is a hole or bug in their software they'd better fix it for free."
1,BEWARE! NO Tech Phone Support!,"The installation on my Windows 2k machine was a nightmare. The program will not install correctly and crashes my cable connection. No computer software is immune from bugs but...I attempted to call customer support but Zone Labs has NO telephone tech support. You heard it right!The website instructs the consumer to first read through 100's of meaningless FAQ's such as ""did you type your registration number correctly?"". If these FAQ's don't solve your problem you can fill out an online form and someone from Z.A. will get back to you.Well, its been 2 weeks and I've received the Auto Reply ""we got your message"" but I have yet to get a reply from a real human. I'm afraid to send them another e-mail because their website rudely states that they will cancel ALL tech requests if you send them more that one request for tech support!Manditory registration robs the consumer of all privacy but I'll let other users write about that one!Rating: Big Fat Zero Stars"
1,"Good idea, Bad Product","I have used and have found that ZoneAlarm has fallen quite short as a firewall. I found it amusing it appears under the anitvirus section, when it does not come out-of-the-box capable of stopping over 2/3 of the current common trojans on the 'net. It's quite user friendly in doing what little protection it is capable of, which -on the positive side- does stop the most casual of attackers. If anyone that is attempting to hack into your machine has the know-how to find your computer through anything other than a simple port-scanning program, then they can get past this."
3,"Good, But Forgetable.","I've read all these Name Taken reviews, and bascially everybody given them a 5 star rating. And i know people are going to discredit my review because everybody else has given it 5 stars. Yes, Name Taken record is a good effort, but i feel its something that can be forgetable really quick. This is because, i think that even though some songs are brillant, on the other hand, some of the songs are nothing but fillers. Alot of the songs sound the same, with singing patterns being bent a hundread different ways. I had hoped that they had put in 'Someone' and 'Safety Of Routine', but they didn't. Having said that, they are some top notch songs here. Such as 'Control', 'Hold on for Your Dearest Life', 'Panic', 'This Was Never', 'Cover Up', and 'It Sounded Prettier In Spanish'. But do check them out, the are sure to come out with something stunning in the future."
5,A wonderfully EASY system for making a quilt.,"This book shows just how ingenious Eleanor Burns really is. A remarkable method of graduating the pattern by UNSEWING tubes of material in different orders. There's also a video available out there that makes this even easier to follow, but the book alone is just fine."
1,Waste if $,"I cant figure out how to work it so I know my daughter wont. No lcd screen, pictures delete themselves for no apparent reason, blurry, software is worthless. I'm going to atempt to return."
2,Too Expensive for the Quality,"My daughter has had this camera for a little while, as we did pay decent money for it and she was only 6 or 7 at the time (trying to make it last). We purchased it at Wal-Mart, and like other reviewers, I don't think I knew, based on the packaging, that there wasn't a preview screen. The quality of the camera itself is cheap - all plastic. The quality of the images is also very poor. I'm talkin' like 120 film kind of grainy. Very disappointing, but it makes her feel good to see the photos she takes regardless of how awful the quality is. The camera is still working, sort of. It has to be plugged into the computer via USB and does take photos as well as enable the webcam. The camera NO LONGER works with batteries. What good is a camera that you have to tote a computer with? Have any other owners come across this scenario? If so, what was the remedy? I'll be seeking out a new, big girl camera for my daughter for her next birthday."
5,A PAGE TURNER,"MARILYN KAYE IS A GREAT WRITER. I ENJOY HER BOOKS VERY MUCH! I HAVE READ THREE SO FAR, AND THESE THREE BOOKS HAVE MADE ME INTO A MAGNIFICENT READER! I HOPE I HAVE MADE YOU INTERESTED IN REPLICA."
1,Curious Juxtapositions,"While I know very little about Quaker boarding schools, I have been studying the traditional boys private boarding military school (middle and high school level) in the U.S. for the past ten years. Very few of my findings or conclusions agree with anything I find in this book. I believe the author probably understands Quaker schools far better than military schools. A curious study, but not recommended"
2,Wiggles,"I think this cd is ok, the songs are pretty good but there is a lot of talking through out the cd. I wouldn't have purchased this cd if I knew that there was dialogue between songs and things like that."
4,Good naval history,"A very enjoyable book for any World War II naval fan. The author did extensive research using German sources to describe part of World War II that few knew about. The most interesting part of the book was not the extensive German organization, no surprise there, but the complete lack of organization on the American side. The U.S. was extremely slow in adopting to meet the threat. The Navy was battleship based. Admirals and Captains wanted large sea battles with other battleships, not hide and seek anti-submarine warfare. As a result, they were unprepared to defend the East Coast from submarine attack. It was amazing the Germans did not do more damage than they did. Check this book out."
4,"Good read, always looked forward to picking it back up.",Very interesting account of the start of U-boat operations off the coast of North America. Few people realize how close U-boats got to our shores (they could hear the waves breaking on the beach from the conning tower). I came away ashamed of the actions of the USN High command in early 1942
2,This is book is OLD! Published in 1998!!,"Ok come on. I graduated in 1998 and you know what times have changed SO much! You know in 1998 it was uncommon to have a personal computer at home? No one had cell phones either! I'm not saying that these examples have much to do with being a SAHM, but reality check here, times are not the same as they were in 1998. I was looking for some current up-to-date info on being a SAHM. Some new ideas if you will. I already know that in 1998 moms cooked, cleaned, ect. I want to know what else I can do. Maybe use technology on my side somehow? Some ideas in that area would be great. I hope I'm getting my point across, it's just not what I expected."
5,"World Class by ""La"" List","Since 1969 Liesbeth List has been performing as a singer and singer/actor. She interpreted the work of the famous Jacques Brel in Dutch and German and added to it, which is not trivial to say the least. She collaborated with Mikis Theodorakis on the Mautausen cycle. Her interpretation of the French Chanson legend Edith Piaf is a true masterpiece. ""NON! RIEN DE RIEN!....""Her divine and strong voice is of a captivating precision and she is able to convey emotion in a credible way. When she sings it feels like love: so beautiful that ist hurts."
1,Inaudible Alarm,"Two words says it all. In the past Citizen watches had alarms which were audible. This one is so faint that one would not hear it unless especially listening for it. Save your money. It's too bad. Good quality, but what good is it if it cannot be heard?"
1,Don't bother,"Rarely do I just write off a book especially of such a prolific writer as Coetzee but this book is such an utter disappointment in his career and its only value lies in that it will prepare you for the even bigger disappointment of his most recent novel, Elizabeth Costello which this book is a precursor. I am not violently opposed to this book neither is the writing that excessively bad...the book is a definition of the utter waste of time."
2,Disappointing compared to a live performance,"I know a taped version of anything is never as good as the real thing, but in this case it's extreme. Having seen this band live, 20 feet in front of me, I really expected more from the CD. They are a great band and put on a fantastic show, but the CD is quite lame. It's too bad, because the band broke up this week. If you like this CD, by all means see them in concert if they ever re-group."
2,Nothing Special,"I really wanted a baby doll my daughter (14 months)could take in the tub with her and brush/wash her hair, etc. This is ok. It serves it's purpose...somewhat. The dolls hair is up in a band which I thought could just be taken out but it is actually ""sewn"" into her hair/head. So she can't really wash or brush the dolls hair. The water seat it comes with is also too difficult for a child to put the doll into. Not worth the money in my opinion, I wish I would have spent the extra money and gotten her a Gotz Baby Bath Doll."
3,"Okay, but don't expect Don Bluth here.","Being a video-only release, AT3 doesn't stand on a par -nor it pretends to either- with the former two movies about the Mousekewitzes saga. Japan-outsourced animation is typical Saturday morning TV fare and storyline is more or less on the same level. However, for anyone who has come to love Fievel and his pals' antics across the years, those pitfalls won't matter much. And kids won't complain at all either - the adventure story plot and vibrant color palette present will keep them well engaged and amused to the end."
2,Nothing new or sophisticated,This book promises more than it delivers. The information is basic and most of it is common sense. Useful only to those who are very young or who for whatever reason have never read anything at all on this sort of subject.
2,Only useful for the very young,"I bought this book hoping it would give me some new ideas and or reminders of how to be a better me. I found all of the ideas to be very simplistic and you can get these from reading free articles on the web. There was nothing new in the book that inspired me. This may be a good book for a young woman freshly out of college and starting a professional job for the first time, but otherwise I can't imagine that a wider audience would get much benefit."
1,Total Waste of Money and Time,I tried to watch this with an open mind I really did. It just wasn't good - it seemed designed just to be repulsive and shocking ripping off Hostel and Saw -with more extreme footage. I think it was an excuse to film skinny naked girls and watch them in degrading situations. It didn't feel like art - it wasn't really interesting and it lacked any redeeming value whatsoever.I'm not saying this couldn't have been a half-way decent film - but it would require someone with more of an imagination and the ability to develop a plot. But that's just my opinion I understand some people really enjoyed it. I have watched other extreme type films and I was surprised at how well it was done no matter how disgusting the subject matter - 'Srapbook' comes to mind. So I thought I'd give this a looksee -but I was disappointed.
1,VHS-Really you still sell these?,"I ordered this as a gift and by the picture it looks like all the DVD's I've ordered in the past. In fact, I've never ordered a VHS tape from Amazon.I can't believe I sent a gift of a VHS tape. How embarrassing for me and Amazon that they still sell these.BAD BAD BAD BAD Experience."
4,Covers a lot; hard to read,"I work in the area of Risk Management for over 8 years and I find this book still covers a lot of what someone in the area needs to know. I think it is rather a reference book, better written than the Bessis book on RM in banking and covering more things on Credit Risk, but still ... it is not a book one can read from start to end. It is good to keep on the shelf and read a chapter on a specific topic when necessary."
5,A Turkish Guide,I am also a tour guide working in Turkey. This present study of Yenen has always been very helpful for me in my three years profession. It is so nice to see a native book after contacting so many foreigners. Strongly recommended if you want more than a usual guide can give.
5,Does Caroline Know?,"This CD is simply a re-issue of the ""12x12 Original Remixes"" CD (which is out of print at the time of this writing), and in turn (with slight track reordering), a re-issue of the first CD from the ""Asides Besides"" release. The previous reviewer's comments apply to the ""History Revisited"" CD, not this one."
1,Absolutely Useless,"This book is absolutely as useless as teats on a canary. Unless you are a dull moron, there is not one inventive suggestion here that is not obvious. I'll sum up the whole book in one simple sentence - Go live in the woods. yeah, that's the crux of his advice. Probably written by some staff member at paladin press, as there are numerous references to other books you can waste your money on. Years ago I bought books from Paladin. Always big promises and nothing of substance!"
1,I wouldn't recommend buying this,"Well written, interesting, but superficial and impractical. Also dated; not made for the ""Internet Age."" Recommendations that simply would not be possible today (I dunno if they were possible when the book was written...) and some suggestions that make sense, and many suggestions that make no sense."
3,Good for some.,"Esoteric. If you don't have a heavy background in English Lit., this book is not for you. Good for the well-informed."
2,Characters Not Very Captivating,"OK story, but gotta say from the start that it's hard to like a book where the back cover (also featured in the description) gets the hero's name wrong (Geoffrey??, the hero's name is Gideon!). The characters were not believable or captivating -- hard to keep reading this one. But the ending was fairly good and all is tied up in a nice package with a bow -- pretty typical. Quick read - not much to it."
1,Broken when it came,"This is the third Hippo Digital scale I have purchased in the past year, one for me and two for presents for others. The one I bought for me is fine, but one that I gave as a present a few months ago, lost the plastic covering over the ""window"" and the last one I just bought came broken and will only show grams and not pounds/ounces like it should.One good scale out of three is not a good ratio to me, so although I would rate the one I got as a 5 star, I have to give the product only 1 star. It's disappointing and bothersome to buy two gifts when one starts to fall apart and the other is broken from day one. Now I have to go through the hassle of a return."
3,serves it's purpose but...,"...it's not very entertaining...i am not a work out addict, so i need to have fun incorporated with my workouts and watching this, i'd rather take a nap..."
3,Disappointed,"I used this cookie press for the first time yesterday. The power rod kept coming out, where I had to reopen the tube, put the rod back in place, and restart. Why is this happening? We made on batch of cookies and I had to do this about 10 times."
1,useless cookie baking item,"This was the worst baking adjunct that I ever purchased and the first item I have returned after actually using it. It does not hold a charge, it is extremely slow and for the most part ineffectual. My ancient hand operated cookie press does the job perfectly and in half the time, however, due to arthritis it is hard for me to use. I will be happy to go back to it!"
5,Great Practice Hand,"First of all, Rick from Seattle is a terrible comedian. That pointless and completely laughable (at you, not with you) review brought the rating of the product down, which is deterring to a person such as myself who is legitimately looking to purchase an item like this.Anyway, this is a practice hand for nail technicians to practice painting nails and doing nail enhancements. I purchased this because it is a requirement for the Washington State Manicure Licensing Examination. It comes with the clamp, the hand, as well as a tube of nail glue and nail tips to adhere to the hand. I hope to do really well on the exam now that I have my practice hand."
3,Good book----Bad ending,"This was a great book in terms of suspense, but the ending was horrible!!! I like to know what really happens to the characters, not just an abrupt ending. #2 was more satisfying."
2,THE BEST FRIEND,"THE BOOK IS ABOUT A GIRL NAMED HONEY.I LIKE THIS BOOK BECAUSE ITS ABOUT SOMEONE WHO MURDERS ALL HONEY'S FRIENDS BECAUSE THE GIRL IS JEALOUS OF THE FRIENDS THE GIRL HAS. SO THEN HONEY IS SUSPECTING AND SHE ASKS THE GIRL,WHO'S NAME IS ASHLEY.ASHLEY SAYS NO THAT SHE DIDNT KILL ALL OF HER FRIENDS.I ALSO LIKE IT BECAUSE ITS VERY INTERESTING AND CREEPY."
3,I've been thinking I should've gotten an electronic scale...,"I like the capacity to hold a variety of food sizes, but I have trouble getting the needle to settle on ""zero"" so I can weigh my food. The other day I was using it and regretting that I hadn't just gotten an electronic one."
4,"Great game, some compatability flaws","Note, I have yet to be able to get this to work on Win 7 64 bit. I have no clue if it will work on 32. Thats my only qualm, otherwise this is in my top 5 for favorite games."
1,Worst Sid Meier game ever,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers. This could have been a good game if it had been done even remotely like the original Railroad Tycoon. Instead, it was made for 3yo's to push around a toy train that they could color. Total waste of hard drive."
1,Unplayable,I tried loading this game on 3 different computers and it would not run properly on any of them. Customer support said my SiS Mirage Graphics Card was not supported. Well I guess my Dell and Toshiba arent either.
4,Not much use.,"I have not used this game much, but when I have, it is a much better game than railroad tychoon III, it is similar to tychoon II. It is fun and addicting."
4,Sids Railroads,"Program is as advertised, but does has a problem with freezing on windows 7 once you get a lot of activity going. It can be resolved by making frequent saves. Other than that, the program is pretty good."
2,Sid what happened?,"I heard about Railroads and preordered it based on two things, one I was lead to believe by the reviews and forums that this was essentially Railroad Tycoon updated, and two Sid Meir had never let me down. I like all Sid Meir games, except this one. This game pales when compared to Railroad Tycoon, or RRT II. I don't like RRT III either but Sid's name wasn't on that one. I started playing RRT around 1990 on a DOS machine. I was hoping that all the game play would be back. Yes RRT was a complex game, but this game has been dumbed down so far that it's not even fun. Laying track exactly where you want it is a pain now. Pesky train switching yards, hotels, post offices, don't worry about it, all taken care of for you! The maps seem overly condensed and gives the impression that your playing in a small space compared to the first game. I'm boxing this back up and hoping to find a suc.....errr buyer on ebay. Keep your DOS version if you still have it."
5,SID MEIERS RAILROAD,THIS IS A GIFT FOR MY GRANDSON WHO LOVES SID MEIERS PIRATES. HE LIKES RAILROADS AND I THOUGHT HE MIGHT LIKE TO BRANCH OUT INTO OTHER GAMES.
4,Sid Meier's Rfailroads,"If you like trains and railroad history, then this video game is a good one to play. It's a lot of fun and a challenge in building railroads and out smarting the AI players."
1,Great Game / Awful Copy Protection,"The game: I love it! I wasn't expecting much from the other reviews here -- but when I downloaded the demo, I knew I needed the full game. It's a lot of fun.The copy protection: Awful! One day I couldn't play this game anymore because it accused me of using a backup. I went online and was told, ""If this message occurs, although you are using the original disc, please check if the correct communication mode is being used with your drive. Please check if the DMA mode is enabled by using the Device Manager""Check the DMA mode? Are you kidding me? It'd be easier not to buy the disk and to not go through this hassle. When will companies learn?If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't buy this disk with it's awful SecuROM 'security' features, even though the game is a lot of fun. Boooo Take2!"
1,Defective right out of the box,"Right after I bought this, the drive wouldn't turn on unless I pressed the button extremely hard. Seagate confirmed to me that the device was defective. All I can say is that if a simple thing like a power button is defective, it doesn't bode well for the device as a whole."
1,"Never again! Long spin-up delays, and unreliable!","I have the 500GB version of this Seagate drive. What a colossal disappointment -- after just a mere 10 minutes or so of non-use, the drive spins down. It's a six-to-eight second wait for the drive to spin back up for the most trivial of tasks, such as a displaying a file open or save dialog.THAT was aggrevating. But what is infuriating is the Seagate's unreliability! Just a couple of months into use it died with a badly corrupted directory. Reading through the comments here and on this model with other size drives I see that this experience is common rather than unusual.I never bought Seagate before, but I had thought it had a good reputation. I'll never buy Seagate again!"
1,"DOA, but Amazon Customer Service is great!","After spending an hour reading and carefully installing the USB hard drive, it was DOA. But a visit to the Amazon website for a return authorization, and then a pleasant chat with a customer service rep seems to have the problem well on the way to resolution. The replacement will be shipped Monday and should be here by the time I return from my trip! Now, if the new one just works!"
3,STILL WAITING FOR THE BEST ONE.......,"Of the CD's available by this unique and talented song stylist, this one is fine (though an odd mix of songs.) 'The Longest Walk,' 'Easy Does It,' and 'Echo of Love' are standouts. HOWEVER........Jaye P. Morgan recorded one absolutely perfect album in her long career, and that white-covered masterpiece was called WHAT ARE YOU DOING THE REST OF YOUR LIFE. Unfortunately, it was released on an oddball label (Beverly Hills) and I've never seen it on CD. If anyone knows where a CD version of that great album could be found.....or even who I should write to urging its release.....please, let me know! Mike Burns, meskb@in-motion.net. Thanks!"
4,"Good value, accurate, easy to use.","This scale has been working reliably for us as a food scale and as a postal scale.Advantages include 2g gradations up to 1000g for accurate measuring of small quantities (5g to 5000g), additive measuring reduces the number of containers we use when cooking, compact and flat size tucks away easily and the ability to switch between metric & imperial on the fly when using bizarre recipies. This one also has the bonus food bowl. Accuracy seems to be spot-on when testing the scale below 1kg.The disadvantages are if you want to weigh large flat items, where you won't be able to see the display or if you need to weigh above 5000g."
3,Insightful and disturbing,"McKenna is an astute fellow traveller in the spiritual marketplace of gurus, workshops and retreats. He has achieved a powerful sense of arrival and claims to be ""enlightened."" Whatever that means and he proceeds to spend this book telling how all of the effort one expends toward it is useless. Apparently, it just happens. Good message, in others words it is simply now and you are it, just get it. This is an old refrain and it is well done with very readable anecdotes and references to Moby Dick, the novel. Not recommended for those who are not strong believers in their path since he delights at describing in detail the fallacies of your practice, whatever it is."
5,Amazing book,"not for the weak of heart or spiritual dabblers. a very sobering look at the cost of freedom from illusion, if one really wants to discover what's true."
3,"ok, but not great","I have read both Jed Mckenna's books. They are OK but not great. I can think of many more books which are more helpful. The idea that ""spiritual autolysis"", that one can write one's way to the truth, well......if writing is not my strong suit then oh well. Entertaining, I got it from the library.It is not a book I would refer to again so I am glad I did not spend money on it. Make up your own mind."
3,Not Fond Of This Product,I ended up buying another scale from Amazon because this scales ability to weigh was off and was not helping me with my ( then ) gestational diabetes.
2,Many gaps,"Excellent detail/coverage for the Central and Southern Fronts. Almost no coverage of the 3-year siege of Leningrad and the Northern Front. Maps were poor detail and definitely not enough of them. You had to be VERY familiar with the geography of eastern Germany, Poland, and western Russia in order to follow along with the details of the text, as the maps were basically worthless."
4,A Gift,"I ordered this book for my nephew. He likes to cook and is interested in history. This was a great gift, and my nephew said he found it very interesting. He is enjoying the book."
4,"""Spice up"" your book collection, hee hee","This is one of the most informative books I have ever read. Extensively researched and beautifully written. I never knew Salt was so important. i loved this book- even if you are not interested in History, I think you'll like this."
3,"Salty ""after-taste""","Kurlansky's effort here is informative but not as engaging as his earlier effort in the history of COD. Having finished this book I am still not sure whether it was written for those of us generally interested in arcane history or just a romp through history for ""foodies"".Reading this was not a complete waste of time but SALT is not the author's best writing."
2,Very. . .slow. . .read. . .,"I was looking forward to reading this book, but simply could NOT get into it. There's nothing that pushes the story along. You read for a few pages about something that maybe, as a stretch, has something to do with salt, and then they'll be some 300 year old recipe. A lot of the poorly connected stories seemed to me to have nothing to do with salt at all, and I really felt like the author was reaching to draw a connection. If it had been edited down to 150 pages or so, not the slow going 450 pages it is, it would have been more bearable.I cannot recommend this book."
2,An Interesting Subject Made Not Interesting,"The author has the same problem here as he has in his later book, ""Birdseye: The Adventures of a Curious Man"": he can't raise the prose above boring. Both subjects would seem to have possibly a wealth of potentially meaty exposition but he doesn't deliver. He just drones on and on while we squirm, waiting for it to be over. His incessant inclusion of old recipes just prolongs the agony. We read half of this and then laid off for 18 months but it didn't get any better in the interim. Another book looking for a magazine article or a better editor."
3,Never finished it,"After having read Kurlansky's previous ""Cod"" and ""The Basque history of the world"", i tackled ""Salt"", but it failed to carry me like its two predecessors. Never finished it. Oops. Maybe some day."
3,Break out the tequila,"If you plan on watching Jeopardy or wish to accumulate a pile of factoids on salt, this volume is for you. Entertaining but best read in small amounts."
4,"Gripping, no. A good reead, you bet","This was not a gripping page turner, but I thought Kurlansky provided a very good overview of a substance that has been with us for thousands of years and has had a profound impact on humankind. I recommend it."
1,Salt: A World History,"I agree with the review posted Oct. 28 03. Shame! on Penguin for allowing a book like this to be published. Spelling errors, syntactical errors, mystifying use of pronouns, cloudy narrative and stultifying cadence. It's discouraging enough when we hear on TV ""The traffic is going good on Route...."" but to read similar poor text in a so-called NYT best seller crosses (sadly) a new line. Who edited this? A second grader? Kulansky's ""Cod"" was excoriated by scholars, wouldn't you think someone would take better care with this new book. Yes, there are interesting anecdotal passages, and salt -- like sugar-- plays a pivotal role in world history, but for heaven's sake give us a WRITER/HISTORIAN/RACONTEUR not a learning-different Matt Drudge with marbles in his mouth."
4,I learned so much from this book,"This book took me by surprise. I thought it would be about saltmaking. Or the use of salt. In fact it's about the whole human history, not just about salt.The book connects the historical facts and everts in such a way... I had more than a few AHA moments. And now I can say I understand many historical events much better than before this book.But I admit, at times this book is hard (or slow) to read - so I gave it 4* instead of 5*."
1,Don't be Fooled by the Hype,"Waltz's book has been *the* tool of realist indoctrination used by American professors of International Relations since it was first published. It is a hideously antiseptic, a-political, and crudely ahistorical. How a sober person could read this book and give it anything but a massive thumbs-down is totally beyond me. Reading it is like drinking bleach."
1,"Great waffles, bad machine","After a few months of weekend use, this waffle maker decided it was dead. While watching tv, I see out of the corner of my eye a large white flash, which apparently was the machine doing something wrong electrically. I tried it again later when it had cooled down, but again the same thing. You'd think an $80 waffle maker would last longer, but I guess not. It's a shame, this thing made the best waffles my fiance and I ever had."
1,Don't waste your money!!,"I receive this as a gift 8 months ago. Used it twice, the third time was on Thanksgiving morning with my family. I made 2 waffles and the unit stopped heating. Searching the internet, I found numerous complaints of the same nature. Apparently, Waring does a shoddy job of wiring and the fuse blows. Don't waste your money on this one. It's definitely NOT a professional appliance."
1,Breaks Often,"Bought 2 of these units for the family. Both failed within 1 month. Replaced under warranty and both of the replacements failed within 1 month. Can you say ""Disposable Waffle Maker""Next, I bought up to the Waring Pro waffle maker. Same problem.These waring units make great waffles, when they work. They just don't work for more than a few months."
3,Good points/bad points . . .,"This is a snazzy looking product that makes good waffles, but it tends to be a bit inconsistent as to various waffle mixes. Rarely if ever is the automatic setting accurate (usually you have to let them cook longer, which is no big deal). The biggest issue with this waffle iron, however, is the cleaning. Why oh why don't the plates detach so you can throw them in the dishwasher? This is a major drawback which makes me think there may be a better option out there. Finally, this thing takes up a ton of space. Overall it does what it's supposed to do, but if I were shopping for a waffle iron again, I'd likely look for something that's a bit more convenient overall, even if it doesn't look like what you'd find in a restaurant or hotel."
2,Heating element didn't last,"This waffle maker worked well - while it worked. I had it for over a year, but only used it maybe 15 times before the heating element went out. It just seems too common for electronic appliances to fail these days. I didn't check, but I'll bet it was made in China."
2,So Close....Yet So Far,"We purchased the Waring Pro WMK300 Belgian Waffle Maker and used it three weekends in a row. The waffles were fabulous on the first two weekends.While cooking the second waffle on the third weekend, the heating element went out on the waffle maker. Very disappointing!! We contacted Amazon.com and the return process was unbelievably painless. We notified Amazon.com on Sunday and received a replacement on Tuesday. FAST!!! Unfortunately, the waffle maker ready buzzer ceased to work while cooking the second waffle!!! It seems we have received two lemons in a row. We will give this one a second chance to redeem itself before notifying Amazon.com again. I know it is cosmetic, but the second waffle maker also had a nasty scratch on the top. We have seen how great the waffles can be, but are very disappointed that the quality just doesn't seem to be there!"
3,amazon service,"The product was good. The time it took to get it here was long, and since it was a present, it was quite a worry. Since I ordered from Amazon, I have been snowed under with unwanted spam and pop-ups. As many as 20 a day. I have spam blocker which is enabled. Never had this before. Will think about this if I should order again."
1,Waste of Money - Only Lasted 3 days,"It made about 6 great waffles and then died on the 3rd day. Now the ""on"" light comes on but the heating element won't heat up. I will try to return it. I see there are 19 other reviewers with the exact same experience."
4,good product,makes great waffles...you have to coat it each time to keep it from sticking. we saw one at a hotel and my grandchildren loved the waffles. it is very close to what they had.. we use it alot on sunday
2,great while it lasted....,"this waffle iron was great while it lasted, although it was a challenge to get just the right degree of crispness. then one day, it suddenly just died right in the middle of making waffles. it's less than 2 years old so pretty disappointing (and not my first disappointment with the Waring brand - my supposedly Commercial Blender died and I even tried having it repaired twice)."
1,heating element broke,"I was so excited when I received this waffle maker for my bridal shower. It made great waffles for the first 3 times, then on the 4th time, the maker just didn't get hot enough and all the waffles turned out barely cooked and limp. I guess my machine had the same problems as all the rest. Beware and don't buy this waffle maker. I'm going to see if i can return it. MAD!"
2,Infant mortality,"WMK300 worked fine for ~3 mos., then failed to heat. Waring website offers no technical information relative to disassembly or repair and lists no service facility within my immediate area.Great while it lasted!!!"
2,Disappointed,"I'm a major waffle-lover, and I'm really disappointed with this machine. I have yet to find a waffle recipe that cooks correctly in this iron. I've tried about ten recipes from various sources including my two tried-and-true recipies that I have used weekly in other irons. No matter how much I fiddle with the temperature, the inside of the waffle is always undercooked when the outside is done. I can leave the waffle in the iron for an extra five minutes (which is ridiculous) and the inside cooks, but then the outside is crumbly and nasty. I've never had trouble with something as simple as a waffle iron before! Has anyone else ran across this problem? I haven't tried using a mix- yuck. Is that predominantly what other reviewers are using?"
1,"Great Waffles, flimsy iron","Every single waffle I made on this iron came out perfect. I just used the Bisquick waffle recipe on the box.HOWEVERAfter 2 years of ownership and VERY light usage (I made waffles maybe 10 times?), the handle BROKE OPF and took the upper cooking surface with it. It looks like a design flaw to me, and it seems this has happened to a number of other people. Waring doesn't offer any kind of repair service, and they won't sell a replacement surface. What kind of professional equipment can't be repaired? What's the point of owning an $80 waffle iron if you can get a $20 one that will last longer?"
1,Well it was great while it lasted.....,"I got this waffle maker in September of '07 and it's seen a lot of use since then. We use it at least twice a week, sometimes more often. The whole family LOVES the waffles this thing makes. Unforunately it just died on me in the middle of making a batch of waffles. After reading about all the problems this thing has, I'm unsure about whether or not I want to replace it or just attempt to get a refund. Everyone is so disappointed in this appliance. Professional quality? I don't think so!"
1,1st try - GREAT waffles...2nd try - NO HEAT!!,"Unfortunately I must add another review to the long list of others whose waffle maker produced excellent waffles...at first. However, after only two uses the waffle maker failed to heat up. The 'on' light was lit but the waffle maker never heated up at all. Despite the fact that it did produce high quality waffles the reliability seems to be a major concern based on the large number of negative reviews. Look elsewhere when purchasing a waffle maker."
3,"Might be the best home option out there, but .....","it has a few problems. I expected this waffle iron to be more durable, especially as its made of stainless.It is a little too flimsy to be called 'professional'. We've had one a month and already the lid has broken and we had to exchange it. Also, I find the built in timer to be completely useless and inaccurate.This iron is good for occasional use only. I think they should be able to do better for $79.Costco now sells the exact same unit with a black base for $59."
2,Great while they last,"The waffle iron indeed makes great waffles but within a year the screws that connect the nonstick waffle grate with the stainless steal, come apart and make the unit UNUSABLE. This same scenario happened not once but twice. You see, I called the corporate office the first time the unit fell apart and complained vehemently until they gave in and sent out another one--to their credit. This replacement one now has had the very same thing happen. The plastic screws come apart and become unable to screw back together (from my abilities, anyways) and, yet again, I am now without a waffle-maker. All I can say is, ""it was great while it lasted."" I would definitely NOT buy something from this company, altogether. Enough is enough."
2,Waring Waffle Maker-WMK300,"This is the second time I've purchase this particular model. It's a great machine which turns out uniform waffles each time. The biggest problem is that the machine doesn't last more than a year or so under NORMAL use, meaning being used to make two waffles a week, before burning out.I'll never buy another Waring Waffle Maker again and suggest others do the same. I just ordered a Presto 3510 FlipSide Belgian Waffle Maker as it's the top seller here on Amazon and the reviews are most favorable."
3,Great Waffles -- when it works..,"This little item is great -- when it works. We tried it twice -- once perfect, the second time after one waffle the thing stopped working totally (power light came on -- no heat).Looking around it appears a lot of people are having this issue -- one person has gone through 4 waffle makers in the last year alone.THe good news is that (and we are about to try it ourselves) -- Waring supposedly has good customer support and will replace the unit in total with a new one if under warranty (1 year).So keep those receipts!!!I am wondering if a more heavy duty unit would be better? Or maybe its just bad luck or??"
5,Best waffle maker... ever.,"This is in my opinion the best waffle iron you can purchase for home use. There might be a better $600 waffle iron out there, but this is far and away and excellent product. Although I do feel that it's a little flimsy to be called a ""professional"" product, and seeing as how I've worked in the food industry my whole life, I feel validated in saying that. However, I have used it for a while now, and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. From soft to crisp waffles in a short amount of time, any easy to use and clean. My ony complaint is that it's rather large for the size of my kitchen. Excellent waffles! Thick and golden, like in the user submitted photos. I've never had waffles so good, not even in a restaurant. The true Belgian waffle recipes do take a bit of patience and know-how, but they're worth the effort. I read some complaints about the timing mechanism, but I find it to be spot on for the most part. Its worth the money."
1,Nice counter decoration,Looks nice and worked great...but only twice. It was a wedding gift and we don't have a receipt. Waring won't even acknowledge you if you contact them. They could do the right thing and offer a replacement part. It can't cost much and I'm sure people would rather pay for it than throw a nearly new waffle maker out. This is the biggest waste of money so play the lottery instead...you have better odds of getting something in return.
3,THREE STRIKES YOU ARE OUT,"STARTED USING WAFFLE MAKER WHILE SNOW BIRDING IN FLORIDA. WE USED IT 3 TIMES AND CAME HOME. ON NEXT TRIP DOWNTRIED TO USE IT AND ALL WE GOT WAS RED ON, WAITED FOR GREEN SIGNAL AND NOTHING. CALLED AROUND AND WAS TOLDYOU BETTER BUY A NEW ONE THEY AREN'T BUILT TO LAST. NOT A BAD PROFIT FOR WARING. YOU USE IT 3X'S AND IT'SPAST THE WARRANTY PERIOD. NO HELP FROM WARING AND WE BUY NOT A WARING PRODUCT EVER.SKIP THE WARING PRO WMK300...........Waring Pro WMK300 (Brushed Stainless) Belgian Waffle Maker Bundle"
4,On 4th one - Stopped Working,"We are on our 4th waffle iron which just broke again after 3 uses. They (Waring) replaced the original waffle Iron with commercial model ""WW150""? each time but those broke too. I'm wondering if these were refurbs???At least I had a local service shop who sent each one back to Waring(cost free to me), but not without each of us joking about it. I'm calling Waring and let them know my thughts on such a bad product....Buyer beware....Update: After calling Waring of CT and getting a hold of a nice woman in customer service she admitted there was a batch of bad waffle irons out there. She apologized, took my information and sent us a brand new waffle iron, same make and model. This one has worked flawlessly for months now. A++ for Waring customer service in US!!! I would definitely recommend!!! The waffles with Carbons Waffle mix are excellent."
2,Great.... until it stopped working,"Ordered this waffle maker on [....] for around $50 a few years ago. We used the waffle iron about once every other month for the last 4-5 years. Just recently the iron stopped working just as a lot of people have noted where the iron turns on but never warms up. Seeing how some people only got a few uses before their irons failed, seem lucky that we got several years of use out of it. Although this would seem that these units will end up failing at some point. Due to the unreliability of the product, we won't be rebuying this iron."
4,great waffle maker,"This waffle maker does all that it claims. Easy to use, doesn't take up much space and it makes consistent great waffles with beeps when to rotate and remove your golden brown waffle. My only quibble would be that it would be nice if the grids were removable for easy cleaning. This was a great birthday present and the family seems to enjoy waffles from scratch more than frozen microwaveable ones."
5,First rate waffle maker with the right mix.,"For years I've searched for the perfect waffle maker and mix combo for my wife who loves (or should I say ""lives for"") malted waffles. Many of her favorite waffle spots refused to reveal their source or recipe, so I bought the Waring Pro waffle maker and Carbon's Malted waffle mix here on Amazon. This is the perfect combination for that great malted taste sought out by the most discriminating waffle junkies (the pumpkin waffle mix from Carbon's is excellent too, like pumpkin bread. Really, I don't work for either Company). Skip the Bisquick and other store-bought ""waffle mixes"" and get the good stuff online (I found out Carbon's not available in grocery stores). By the way, the Waring Pro is very easy to use and maintain. It's clean lines don't look bad parked on the kitchen counter either! Golden Malted Waffle and Pancake Mix, Blueberry, 33-Ounce Can (Pack of 3)"
1,Waring Pro waffle maker,"I've gone thru 3 different Waring Pro waffle makers. None have ever lasted more than 6 months. Each one was used between 8-15 times. They all worked great when I first bought them but after a few times of being used, they would not heatup any more. The light would come on when switched on but they would no longer heat up."
5,I love this!!!,"My husband gave me this as a Christmas gift since he witnessed me come very close to throwing my Toastmaster out of the window several weeks ago... and what a wonderful piece of kitchen equipment it is! It didn't take me very many tries to come up with a relatively healthy recipe either. I use buttermilk pancake mix, whole wheat flour, baking powder and soda (for leavening the flour), skim milk, canola oil, and either ground cinnamon or almond extract or vanilla extract. And, absolutely essential, one egg white beaten until stiff peaks, then folded into the batter. The waffles are crispy on the outside, tender on the inside, and delicious. The Toastmaster is... TOAST!!! Also, waffles take a very short time to cook, and I love the beeper which signals when the waffle is done (so I don't have to keep an eye on the ""ready light"" constantly)."
2,It was confusing.,I give it 2 and half stars. I was confused by the style of writing. It would just jump from one scene to another without letting you know when it was going to happen and the author did it alot. I did not like that. The book had the potential to be better but because of the writing it wasn't and I feel they was things lacking especially with the characters. I'm surprised I got through this quickly. Good thing I got this book for very cheap.
1,Can't read,"This is a very confusing book. There are whole passages whited out. As if there were top secrets written and so crossed out. If this was the intent of the author, it does not work for me. It was so difficult to follow, I stopped reading the book. If I had known this, I would not have bought the book."
2,disappointing,"they have such potential for catchy yet throw-down music. a few really good tracks, but too many sissy girly songs for my taste."
4,fascinating,"Mormons will see this film as anti-Mormon, and others will see it as an accurate depiction of the facts.This video does not seem ""anti-Mormon"" to me, just factual.I did not enjoy the recreation of 1840 scenes. The filming did not seem to match the times. I think it would have been more interesting just to have pictures of the 1840 era used in the film with maybe a Ken Burns type of effect.If the Egyptian-studies scholars had been interviewed, the 1840 pictures used, I would have found it more interesting. the scenes recreating the times just seemed too bright, the actors seemed too modern. Just not as believable as other films depicting that era.BUT...that is not to say the film is not interesting. It is. And the facts speak for themselves. Another interesting book: You may wish to read By His Own Hand Upon Papyrus.If you are LDS, you may find a good rebuttal to this film by searching for publications from FARMS (at BYU)."
5,A clear presentation of facts,"Two things I liked about this video. One, is that it explains what the Book of Abraham is, since most Mormons are hesitant to talk about it. Two, it shows the flaws with Joseph Smith's interpretation of the Egyptian scroll, which Mormons will claim is the Book of Abraham."
2,You'll Scream Too!!!,"Who's idea was it to use ""Somewhere Over the Rainbow"" as a background theme for a Noir film?? It's not only distracting, it becomes down right irritating! I can't think of another film where the music plays such a negative roll in breaking the mood/scene time after time. Too bad, the movie otherwise is very good, especially the cinematography which is first rate."
1,Skip it,"I'm a huge Savage Garden and Darren Hayes fan. I love all the songs they make. But ""I Bet He Was Cool"" is a HORRIBLE song! Darren sounds like he's singing out his nose. It doesn't even sound like Darren. The whole thing is just terrible. Buy a Savage Garden album or buy Darren's new solo album but do not buy this single!"
5,The best methods book I have seen,"This book is excellend for graduate and undergraduate students alike. Fortunately this book was written by someone who knows what most students of political science want know: how to interpret data. This book is to be used with SPSS which is arguably one of the best statistical programs available.Anecdotely, I am horrible at math. This book is light on math. It does explain the concepts behind the statistics without booging you down it too much technical jargon. You will learn Chi-square an what it is for but you are not expecte to know the formula.This book may be light on math for students truly interested in the actuarial sciences and its apllication to political science, but for those who wnat to know how to use statistics for interpreting political science, this is the book for you."
2,damaged,Book arrived with packaging intact but book itself was water damaged at the top and that wasn't stated in the description when I bought the book! Will not buy from this seller again.
1,"grit in product, returned to manufacturer","I tried bottle 1 of 4 & found a gritty substance in the product. I tried bottle 2 of 4, same thing. I emailed the manufacture, Chattem Inc. Chattem sent me a return label & asked that I send them the 4 bottles I had. I did this on June 14, 2008. Waiting on replacement coupons now. Do not know the final outcome."
1,Birds hate it! Small cakes too.,"Don't know what's in this stuff, but it is the last food that the birds in the area seem to eat. A competitive brand goes in a day or two, this stuff hangs around for weeks (good thing it's winter in the Northeast). They seem to eat it only when there's snow on the ground and other food is scarce. While the competitive brand's two cakes barely fit in a ""double"" feeder, three of these go in with room to spare. Sunflower seeds, thistle seeds, other suet all are preferred to this stuff. The birds will even risk eating within 15 feet of the house rather than have this suet 100+ feet away.Go for Mills Brothers Wild Bird High Energy Suet Value 8 Pack and your birds will thank you."
5,Information is Comforting,I found this to be a great resource book. I helps me reinforce the information my doctor provides me when discussing my treatments.
5,i_ryde69,"not so much padding, cheap material, I would never buy syder brand again. I washed it and it's start ripping off from the armpit side!!! dont this , get a empire ground punder it's way way way better!!!1"
5,Motive Power Bleeder for GM cars is excellent,"The Motive Power Bleeder for GM cars and trucks works just as advertised. The product fits the master cylinder perfectly. Having read the other reviews there is one common element that all the satisfied customers share. The adapter was specfic for their application. If you go to their homepage, Motiveproducts.com, there is an Application Guide you can only find at the top of the homepage. There you can find the exact adapter needed for your car. And as another reviewer mentioned teflon tape is needed to seal the connection of the bleeder tube to the adapter tube."
5,great solo tech tool,"Works great,perfect fit on vehicle.Very easy to set up and use.Not having to yell instructions for someone to pump the pedal and hold is a huge comfort."
4,Excellent book by an experienced practicioner,"I wanted to find a book that I could recommend to my requirements-challenged clients. This was the first I bought and the last I'll need. The author has a solid command of the subject and obvious real-world experience. Nestled among the chapters are over 60 ""tests"" to tell if you have real requirements.I only gave it four stars because I was put off by the author's tilting at windmills in the first few chapters as he tries to stave off imagined criticism."
2,Disappointed,"Upon receiving the Rowenta TO816 2-slice toaster, I was surprised to learn that it is primarily plastic. The slice guides were wedged into the frame and were not working properly. After prying them out with a knife, one side is slightly bent. The sides do not toast evenly which is fine for toasting a bagel, but you are required to rotate the toast manually to even the toasting process. Expected more for the price. Would not recommend."
5,Can't find it anywhere-- I love Amazon!,"I've been looking for this product everywhere, I fell in love with it, and they stopped selling it in my local area. Thankfully Amazon came to the rescue, this product is tingly, and exfoliates, I love it!"
1,VERY POOR ANIME. ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH,"This anime shouldnt be called a movie.Its only 22-23 minutes,the whole so called movie sounds like a mere episode of an unknown series.Dont bother with this."
2,Faulty product - Good return service,"I purchased this product as a Christmas gift for my sister. She entertains a great deal and this tray seemed to be something she would be able to use often. Wrong! First time she plugged it in, it blew the fuse. She opted to return the tray. The seller credited my card without a fuss.I do NOT recommend the item, but would purchase from the seller, again."
5,No Movie can Come Close,"Incredible action, adventure, and romance for all ages! Dumas is the greatest writer in the world!"
5,"Lots of fighting, courage, and intrigue","After encountering this story first through television and then in films, it was a pleasure to read the original novel, which is full of bold and venturesome drama. The characters are vivid (sometimes foolish, ofttimes arrogant, but never dull) and the tales fast paced. There is even a surprising twist in the turn of events near the end. Dumas wrote a good book that is lots of fun to read."
2,The Three Adulterous Cads,"I really wanted to enjoy the swashbuckling adventure in this classic, but all the main characters were such unrepentant cads that I just couldn't get into it. Throughout the book, the characters show an absolute disregard for marriage and most of the adventures in the book revolved around pursuing, covering up, or avenging one illicit affair or another. If you don't mind a character whose only virtue is ""a swordsman's honor,"" unswerving loyalty to their comrades, and witty banter then you'll probably love this. Personally, I like my heroes to have a little more noble aims than getting away with sleeping with anyone who strikes their fancy and helping others to do likewise."
2,disapointed,"Frank's ideas on this DVD are probably good in theory, and I like his physical approach with the horses, but the fact that he chose to wear shorts, yes, shorts to ride in a Western saddle seemed ridiculously unprofessional to me. I just feel supposed equestrian professionals should demonstrate and ride properly attired to suit their discipline. His first DVD, ""Discover the Horse You Never Knew"" had much better presentation. I have been to many clinics and horse expos over the years and have NEVER seen any clinicians or trainers wear shorts. Sorry, Frank."
2,Unreadable Translation,"The translator seems to have had a very poor grasp of English. There are few obvious mistakes, but the sentences are clunky and the diction too far removed from common usage. Children will most likely be unable to read it, since so many words are archaic. Molnar's book is a masterpiece, but reading it in this translation is worse than not reading it at all."
2,"Bad Buttons, Short Battery Life","Beautiful to look at, BUT, I agree with other reviewers that buttons are difficult to operate and don't even work sometimes, plus be prepared to change batteries every few months--ridiculous for something that uses TWO lithium batteries and is not in heavy, or even everyday use!"
4,Quality Product,"Good Product - I have now had it for at least 3 years - used it to help my husband lose 30 pounds. We weighed various portions of meat to get the idea of what 3 oz. of chicken looks like so we could accurately portion out his meals when counting calories. His weight stayed off and all is good - now I use this wonderful scale to weigh our bread dough and meat balls etc. If you cover the glass ""platform"" with plastic wrap clean up is a snap. I also find it easy to measure things (like flour) but placing a bowl on the scale and zeroing out the weight of the bowl then placing the flour in the bowl to weigh it. It takes a Lithium battery #CR2430 - they are not lifetime, but cost only $3.99 at Batteries Plus. The product has a nice auto shut off feature to save battery life and this first battery (provided with the product) lasted 3 years with weekly use. Worth the price - easy to use."
4,easy scale,"I just received it.Seems solid, accuracy of almost 1g.Be careful, you can use the grams and the pounds, but not at the same time (you need to do a setting under the scale near the battery)."
5,Wake up to sunshine,"Gentle music with a lilt, birds, water, a tropical scent, a feeling of sunshine. Wonderful for a flowing ""sun"" practice."
2,hoodless and doorless,My two boys have lots of Transformers. This is the least sturdy one ever. The hood refuses to stay on and comes in several pieces and the doors pop on and off if you breathe on it too hard. The legs on this one are really hard to squish into car mode. Pass on this car if you actually intend to play with it.
4,Hometown Fun,"This book was very touching. As someone who grew up in a small town, I can understand the intimacy shared between the locals. Everyone either knows everyone, or knows someone who does.Margaret Watson does a great job of portraying the small town atmosphere without being condescending in the end. The main character, Claire, begins with a large amount of angst when she returns from the big city to her orphaned nephew, Nick. She butts head with Tucker, the football coach over parenting issues with Nick.Besides the love story that develops between Claire and Tucker, there is mystery surrounding her sister's death.Overall, I felt this novel was well-written. Claire showed some shortcomings I wasn't comfortable with, but they were minor and not hard to ignore, given the entirety of the story.I'd say that if you want a heart-warming romance with a hint of mystery, this is a good pick."
4,Grate Grill,"I've had this panini press for 6 months now, and use it at least twice a week. Works extremely well, as advertised. Easy to clean, and stores well, too. It gets verry hot unlike some countertop grills on the market steam the meat. Crispy well marked dinner and lunch entree's. Non-stick coating still shows no indication of wear. This grill looks snazzy too! Makes super panini; the recipes enclosed, (of which I've used 2) are a great guide to the world of hot pressed sandwiches. Next purchase, is a panini and bruschetta cookbook. Overall, very happy with this purchase"
5,Even better than anticipated,"I purchased the Villaware after researching quite a few Panini grills...and boy did I choose wisely. I am a novice in the kitchen, but I am happy to report that my grilled sandwiches have received a handful of rave reviews. I now use it at least twice a week.One caveat, the black metal piece on the back portion of the grill, really does get HOT! Unfortunately, I learned this the hard way. Final verdict: So far this Villaware Panini Grill is the smartest appliance purchase, I've made this year."
2,Hard to clean,This grill is heavy duty and heats well. It makes good Panini but I've given it a low rating due to it's difficulty in cleaning. I don't understand why the manufacturers of these contact grills can't make the grill plates REMOVABLE!Now I see that Cuisinart has. Do yourself a favor and get that one.
2,Not a quality Barbie movie,"Let me first start by saying this movie does have pretty music and my daughter did like it. However, I as a mom did not like it and do not approve. The snoby rich girls in the movie are not role models that I want my 4 yr old daughter watching. After my daughter watched this movie two times, I found her walking around the house mimicking and repeating lines the rich snobs said in the movie. I wasn't exactly thrilled about that. I am dissapointed with this Barbie movie."
1,disappointing,"Doesn't follow the traditional 'Thumbelina' tail at all. Plus, instead of the Barbie tails we know and love with a grown up girl, we get a little pixie/fairy thing. I applaud their good message with being 'green'. But overall the movie was disappointing. I saw it once when it first came out and never watched again. Plus I don't like the way Thumbelina looked and her voice! argh! The DVD cover is also misleading as her hair is not even down at all during the film, it's always up.They should've stuck to the traditional fairy tales. Which I miss and love"
5,Incredible,"The music is gorgeous and very well done. The CD puts all of the music together in a way that showcases each piece and enhances it. I was a little disappointed that the piano piece from ""Valley of Darkness"" wasn't included, but otherwise, I don't think it could have been better."
3,Solid. (FYI: Track 1 is all instrumental),"This is an enjoyable soundtrack that other reviewers describe aptly. I will add only that Track 1, ""Colonial Anthem (Theme from Battlestar Galactica),"" from the 2nd season's episode, ""Final Cut,"" is all-instrumental even though there is also a chorus singing during one section of the Anthem in ""Final Cut."" I admit to being sorely disappointed that the choral element was not included in Track 1."
5,Memoriable Soundtrack,"Let me start that I'm grossly absorbed by this show. The drama is very compelling as I find it near to my own experiences in life, aside from the mass genocide of the human race by the machines they built.After watching each episode of Season 2 many times, I feel like I know the show pretty well, so to get the soundtrack, I was excited to relive those moments again. Much like the Season 1 Soundtrack, Bear McCreary, the composer, held true to the diversity of instruments that brings together the culture of our world into a musical tapestry. Instead of repeating the same instruments though, he reached out and brought new tools which give the world of Battlestar Galactica the richness it deserves in telling a story as well developed and engrossing as it does every episode.Get it and enjoy it. I bought mine, in fact, I even got Bear to autograph my copy."
1,"""Derailed"" derails","""Derailed"" is a major disappointment. And it shows what hype can do for a book. The main problem, as others have pointed out, is the deus ex machina. I started off with great expectations and liking this book. But early on it seemed as if it was largely directionless. That's not to say it wasn't going anywhere, but the protagonist (and I use the word loosely) was hardly driving the plot. And then comes the big resolution, which is not of his making at all. I was hoping that the protagonist would turn the tables on the badguys and use their own methods against them, hoisting them on their own petards, so to speak. Instead, the resolution comes out of nowhere and has nothing to do with anything the protagonist does. Didn't an editor notice this? I guess they didn't care 'cause it's all in the hype. On top of this, the writing is, at best, pedestrian. ""Derailed"" runs off the tracks long before the final fade out."
5,Derailed is a Winner,"Derailed is a classic, cautionary tale with enough suspense and plot twists, to keep a jaded reader like me turning pages. Charled Schine is is an advertising executive with job troubles, a sick daughter and a preoccupied wife, trapped on the commuter treadmill. When he meets a dropdead gorgeous woman on the train from Long Island to NYC, sparks fly. She's just what his bruised ego needs. They meet for dinner, have an affair, and then the blackmail starts. Derailed is a well-crafted novel. Siegel throws in enough action, suspense and humor to keep you turning pages. His dialog is flawless. I gave Derailed 5 stars and intend to read more of Siegal's thrillers."
2,Bungle after botch,The first chapters'll hook you up. But after several pages you'll start to see overly blunders i.e.How many times can you tell somebody that you want him to kill a man? If he beseeches you to tell him once and again which person to kill. You won't have any inklings why?How many times can you get attacked by the same man and always forget that he has a gun or gat as is written in this book?Do you really expect that taking out of your trust fund a bunch of money your wife'll never ask why?Do you really expect to sidle in at a mob's office to open his safe?
1,Completely Ridiculous,"I borrowed the book from the library because I had seen the movie and hoped the book would be better. The book was actually much worse and a further insult to any reader's intelligence. The ""hero"" Charles Schine, is a moron who can't figure anything out until more than halfway through the book. What happens both before and after is so ludicrous I put the book down several times. The writing is annoying, with several paragraphs of what Chuck feels and what he thinks might happen finally followed by what actually is happening. It's BORING!! As for the ending, don't you think a state prison is going to do a background check on a teacher?!!What a waste of paper and my time."
5,Very Good,"I bought this book after seeing it advertised on tv . I bought it and could hardly put it down. Was a fast read, couldnt stop turning the pages to see what happened next."
3,Doesn't live up to the hype--,"Although this book was better than the movie (like most) and does a great job of depicting the world of con men/women and criminals that few of us see and shows just how easily your life could be destroyed, I figured out who the ""culprit"" was about halfway through and spent the rest of the book waiting for it to end. I think if I hadn't seen and read so much about the movie and the book described as a ""shocker"", I might not have been disappointed, but it became very obvious that some things were just too ""convenient"", and for me, anyway and ruined the surprise. However, I did love the character of Lucinda Harris and thought the way the writer depicted her was clever. And to be fair, I loved the ending, which was excellent. If you haven't read or seen anything about the book, you'll probably like it much better than I did!Lynne LoganAuthor of The Crime Chronicles of Decker Zane"
5,Chevy Impala Passenger Side Headlamp,The headlamp assembly I purchased was a perfect fit and match for my 2002 Chevy Impala. I am so very pleased with the service I received from Amazon.com including the shipping and handling of this item. The price was awesome and my car looks like new again. Thanks Amazon.com.
3,"Good ideas, but lacks unpredictable moments","There are some great ideas ih the book, but...The beginning of this tale is nonsense. Lacks a really good reason.And everything was so predictable. There are no real surprises in the book. You just know what's going to happen next.I hope part II is better"
1,The weight changes??,"I just want to second, or confirm the review earlier.1. Yes, the plastic is very flimsy, both in look and feel.2. Let's say you put on something that's 15 grams-ish. For the next 3 minutes, you will see the readout changes from 15 to 16, then back to 15, then to 14, then back up to 16, then up to 17, and finally comes back down to 15. What kind of scale does that?!Yes, it is cheap, but don't bother."
2,Insufferable,"Don't rent this, even for a spoof, it's very low class. When it comes down to spoofs, just a little wit goes a long way and this falls well short."
2,Couldn't even finish watching it,"I love ""spoof"" type comedies don't get me wrong, and Danny Trejo's name made me think this might be worthwhile, but it was not. The ""comedy"" was beyond corny .. really, really cheesy. I tried to get through it for most of the day (after pausing here it & there to do more exciting things like.. wash dishes) but ultimately just could not. I will say however that they did manage to find actors that are very similar in appearance to the actual ""Twilight"" actors, and for that I tacked on a star. BUT, what a waste of $5 :-/"
2,The acting was really bad,If you want to make fun of a movie you should make sure you don't just make yourself seem stupid. The jokes were overly juvenille
3,"OK, but another of Dahl's is likely better","From the overhead picture on the cover to its conclusion, there's enough of Dahl's trademark silliness and creativity to satisfy a fan, but all within a not particularly compelling tale of a youngster who escapes his household confines, goes into the forbidden forest beyond, and discovers the Minpins, tree-dwelling miniature people unknown to the outside world. They have adapted to their world's major danger, the unseen fire-breathing Gruncher, who is making Billy's leaving the trees impossible because our hero must also avoid it. Probably a more than acceptable read to a middle elementary school child reading long picture books, it falls short of Dahl's longer books for older kids or his hysterical and bawdy adult books."
4,Falsely advertised,"I ordered these as gifts for myself & a girlfriend for Christmas. I was disappointed because the ones I had ordered thru you wasn't what the description had said they were. It read like this. Select Spa complete therpy for hands & feet $50.00 value - free nail & feet implements. These implements were no where to be found. Although I will still use it, and no doubt enjoy it because I enjoy pampering myself. It's the idea I didn't get what was described. Please look at the description in my order & click on all the pictures, then for ward it to the company you ordered it from and see how they are willing to compensate for it. And then e-mail me back. Awaiting response. I truly believe in paying for what I get. And by no means did I get what I paid for."
5,all tied up and no where to go,"Victor Terry is unsurpassed in creating the mind, the emotions and the entire psychological milleu in which his characters work out their desires. This is the hottest, tensest bondage book i have ever read. Not a bondage freak myself, i did not expect to get as turned on as i did by what Terry does. He is a master, in more than once sense of the word. No one who enjoys gay fiction will not enjoy this book."
1,Read the Reviews!!!,"I absolutely agree with the previous reviews. Do not buy this item unless you participated in the reenactment and you want a nice picture of yourself to show the kiddies. Needs maps, pov, narration, music and it just goes on and on. I cannot believe that I paid for this thing. I have learned my lesson, READ THE REVIEWS."
2,Very amateurish,"Was excited to get a video on Cooch's Bridge! However, I was very much disappointed when the video is poorly done. There were a few tid bits of information on the engagement that became known as the battle of Cooch's Bridge but the video is very disjointed - using reenactors - and not edited to show a very cohesive story of the battle of Cooch's Bridge. A map of the battle would have helped alot as well as more information on the geography and commmanders would have been beneficial. This looks like a video that was done with very little editing. Very amateurish and very disappointing."
2,Only a Windows card,The SB Live 24bit is a Windows only sound card. It relies too much on the operating system. Linux users must deal with a lot of tweaks to get it work at 50% because no input is supported.
1,inferior quality product,"I had this in my computer for a month, with a satellite radio on the audio-in and speakers on the line out. It started crackling and the audio was distorted after a few weeks. I took the SB out and went back to the motherboard onboard audio and it worked fine.Conclusion = Sound Blaster sucks"
3,Its age assists in the Observations,"Some anthropological guesswork as is typical of the genre is mixed with as authentic representation as is possible by derivative as opposed to original pratice of the culture. Its age and first entry into the field helps in that in 1891 anthropological observation of a culture relatively unspoiled by colonial intrusion was more accurately observed although interpretative Western lenses are unavoidable. One is reminded of what noted Antropologist Dr. Dorothy Lee said afer a lifetime of study of American aboriginal culture: "" If its accessible, it is not authentic; if it is authentic, it will be inaccessible.If one is given to acceptance of anthropology as a scientific social discipline as opposed to scholarly myth-making, the opus is an acceptable specimen of the genre."
5,Oneida Michelangelo Steak Knife Set of 4,The delivery was quicker than I expected. The product was packed fine. All the knives seam fine. I would use them again!
5,"Humorous and Uplifting, A MUST READ....",This was my first Lynsay Sands book and it was GREAT. I couldn't put it down. Anyone who says this is not a good book should not be reading romances.
5,Another Great Romp,"Lynsay Sands is my favorite writer of romantic comedy and I loved The Switch. Twins are always fun, and I loved watching the bewildered hero try and figure out what was going on!"
4,Solid look into independent martial arts shorts!,"For fans of martial arts and low budget films, A55 films delivers a full featured action packed dvd with 9 short films from various directors. Particularily interesting is the stringing together of the movies to make one long film, breaking them up into chapters.Everything from director commentaries on each film, to photo galleries, outtakes, bloopers, a crazy fighting game, and hidden menues can be found on the dvd. This is a must purchase for fans of independent cinema, and those looking to get into making movies themselves.The nine movies are DARE, KAELA, GUNG-HO, TEAMWORK 2, PRISON WARZ, COLLECTION AGENCY, CRADLE OF THE BLIND, KUNG-FU LEGENDS: TURBO, and CROUCHING WAITER, HIDDEN CHEFEvery film has something different to offer, some shot on 35mm, some on digital, different lighting, plots etc.., and best not to spoil them here, just buy it and find out!"
1,Don't use this book!,My professor wanted to use this book for an abstract algebra for students in a math education program. This book contained so many typos that it was difficult to read and understand the material the author was presenting. This book should have been revised in the last 3 years to fix all the typos. I feel this is both the author's and publisher's responsibility to the readers.
5,Good for future teachers,"I believe this text of abstract algebra would work very well for future high school teachers in their training, since the book aims to answer a problem that is at the heart of high school algebra: solution of equations by radicals. Of course a high school student need not know Galois theory, but her math teacher should have some knowledge about the solvability and insolvability of equations. Also this follows the development of history, so all the ""abstract"" algebra don't seem too abstract with the motivation of problems and examples in history."
3,Easy to UNderstand,I have this book for a class I'm taking and we are following it to the T. It is very easy to understand and could be used for anyone interested in learning more about how to run their own personal finances and wants to know what investing is all about.
4,How can we ever really know who killed the president?,"The Guns of Dallas is a good first novel. It weaves painstaking historical research with creative license to craft a compelling plot. The characters, real and imagined, are disturbingly believable. A story as dangerous as this could only have been written as fiction. This is a mystery that must be read."
1,"Don't walk away, it will change weight","I totally agree with the last review of this scale. By the time I weighed out the next ingredient to be added to the bowl on the scale, the display showed 8-16 grams more. I even delayed the time between adding ingredients hoping the scale would settle on a single weight. I tried using different types of bowls (plastic, glass, metal), but it made no difference. The buttons are inadequate. It is hard to discribe the button design because the right front edge of the scale is labeled ON OFF TARE. You may turn the scale OFF trying to TARE the weight of the last ingredient. This usually leads to a loud expletive. I purchased this scale based upon the good reviews this product had as well as the fact that this scale is from the same company that manufactures the most highly rated, but very expensive, scale I've found. However, based on what I know now, I would never recommend this scale to anyone. I guess I got what I paid for - a cheap scale."
1,MISLEADING DESCRIPTION!,"Please be advised that the description provided herein is misleading - they claim to measure within 0.1 oz increments, when in reality there is no decimal reading on this scale. It measures in 1 oz increments only!"
5,"Zane, why do you do these things to me?","This was another great book by Zane. I was so into it I just couldn't put it down. When I had to I couldn't wait to pick it back up and start reading again. Poor Jon, she was still a virgin to her knowledge, but Jude was sexin it up. If that wasn't enought then there was Jetta the 3rd personality. Jetta let the cat out of the bag. I can't tell you the story you got to read it for yourself. Zane you got me addicted to your novels. Keep it up!"
3,Zane--What was this?...Disappointed.,"The title of the book should be called ""Disappointed"" for the millions of Zane fans such as myself, who I'm sure weren't too thrilled with Zane on this one.Did I say already that I wasn't too thrilled with this one? Well, I'm gonna say it again! NOT TOO THRILLED!! It was simply boring to me. It did not hold my intest at all. I made myself finish it, because it was a Zane book. Any other author, I would have simply stacked on my shelf along with all of the other ""loser novels"".My expectations of Zane are high. I have bought every last one of her books, so when I'm helping make someone rich, I expect the best my money can buy! When I spend my ""hard earned money"" for a hardcopy of a book, it better be worth it,... and this was NOT.p.s. Sorry Zane, ""Just keepin' it real"" as a fan...Please come better next time."
1,Don't waste your money,"I had just finished the 50 Shades of Grey Trilogy and a friend recommended ""Zane"" to me. I ordered both books and struggled to get throught it. Never even started the second. NOTHING like 50 Shades. Reads like the trash you buy in Truck Stops."
5,AMAZING!!!!!!,"nervous is such an incredible book i read it within 2 days my friend loaned me the book and im glad she did, i could not put the book down under any circumstances ive read mostly all of zane's books that shes come out wit so far. i reccomend this book too anyone who hasnt read it yet"
2,Not the best!,"This book was a big disappointment. She had a good subject, MPD and she did not work a believable storyline. I will read more books by her because I believe she can write a good story."
2,Ok But Not Great,This was one of Zane's worst books...You didn't have to be a genius to figure out who was responsible for Jonquinette's multiple personalities...The book was too predictable.
4,Wanting More,"Zane has done it again. I can't wait for the next book to come out. This book was excellent. I am not to fond of the Sex Chronicles 1&2 but the books she write where their is a story behind the behavior are just off the hook. Zane says there will be five books in this serious, and I can't wait. Please if you read this book, please also read Addicted. After Zane is done with these books she won't have anymore sex stories to write about. I do have some concern about the condom usage which was completely obselete in both books. Also I am so curious as to why Ms. Spencer choose that career. I know there is a story behind her as well."
2,defected product,"The boiler worked ok at the beginning. But after a week, it stopped switching to keep warm after water was boiled, water kept just boiling unless I unplugged outlet. Amazon sent me a replacement, this time it is even worse. The boiler has the same defect from the first time I used it. I think something wrong with this model."
2,inner wall rusted and Telfon fell out,"I bought this pot because it's made by famous Japanese brand. This pot is still functioning very well and did a good job.HOWEVER, after 5 years of using this pot, the edge of pot has rusted. This is the SCARY part....In the past 6 months I started feeling strange taste/smell of the water. I first thought might be I started using different brand of water filter (switch from PUR to Brita). I then continued using it until I finally unplugged and emptied it last week. What I have found out was a layer of grayish powder on the bottom of the pot. Highly suspect it was from the Telfon layer of the inner pot. It was gradually disposed and mixed in my water. I was being poisoned for xx years!I am in the market for another water pot. For sure, I will not buy any pot with Telfon coated!!!"
1,Not much product for your money,"This Eureka brand floor saver is not much more than a very thin sheet of very ordinary vinyl. The photo on Amazon might look like there are grommets in the corners for your tent stakes, but look closely and that is not the case. I ordered this product along with a new tent, but I could have done better at a fabric or hardware store.Eureka! Tent Accessories Floor Saver / Rectangular Large Md: 2660155"
3,Too THIN for AZ!!!!,"We were surprised how thin it is! We used this floor saver on a 2 night camping trip at the Rim and it developed small rips in several areas. Yes, we cleared the site of rocks, the best we could in the failing light. However, it fits our tent and packs beautifully. Easy to clean/dryWe will see how it preforms on future camping trips. So for now it is just ok for AZ"
1,Rubbish,"This sheet of plastic is a waste of money, big time. We bought it to fit the three man Eureka tent and it only just covered half the floor. We have since found out that we ordered the small floor saver as there was no option given to buy the medium on the web site. After a test setup on grass it had holes in it and no it doesn't have grommets in the corners. I could have bought better from the hardware for a lot less. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I can only think that the product must have changed if people gave good reviews. There is no way known that it could get a good review."
5,An articulate view of the integration of faith and business,"In the tradition of Max DePree's ""Leadership is an Art,"" John Beckett's ""Loving Monday"" offers practical, readable, engaging guidance on the ways and means of succeeding in business while maintaining integrity, excellence, vision and passion. ""Loving Monday"" is applicable to anyone in business, from retail or service front lines, assembly lines, senior management positions or board chairs."
4,A World Apart,"If this is the book I am thinking of, it takes place on a world like earth but different. It is a world of Astrology and your sign that you were born under is very important. This is a book of murder, romance mystery and suspence. I recommend it highly!"
3,"great content, horrible writing","First of all, let me say that I really admire Bret Lott for writing about a child with Down Syndrome and the child's relationship with her mother. I also admired the mother and child for their indomitable spirit. However, Mr. Lott's style is painful to read...meandering, graceless and filled with quotations from the Bible, which is a great and sacred source, but the numerousness of the quotations suggested that Mr. Lott was not comfortable with his own writing (which could definitely use improvement)."
2,Just OK,"Although it seemed to be a good story, the more I read it,the longer it got; and as a Mississippian, the more annoyed I got. For starters, BL's favorite word seems to be ""cracker"", judging by how many times it was used by his character in the book. I'm a 41-year-old well-read Mississippi native and I had no idea what a ""cracker"" was. I had to go look it up in the dictionary! And I also got annoyed by some of the sentence structure that supposedly showed ""Southern flavor"", but in the end got old. And Mississippi, toward the end of the book, was made to seem the ""armpit"" of civilization. I would have liked it more had Jewel simply been yearning to return to her family in California, not harping on the mosquitos, humidity, heat, snakes, etc. in Mississippi. I wouln't really recommend this book to anyone unless they want to ""slog"" through the endless sentences that went on forever. Well, after reading my own review, I'm changing my 3 stars to 2!"
5,This book is one of the best....,I thouroughly enjoyed this book! Mr. Bret Lott did a beautiful job piecing together the story of how a small Mississippi family found their way out to California to let their daughter attend a school for children with Downs Syndrome. I was very moved and I recommend this to everyone.
4,An beautiful story but still lacking.,"This book is definetley written very well, as Oprah said on tv but I think that the characters could have been more interesting & could have been developed more. This book could have been one of the best I have ever read if the characters just simply engaged my attention a bit more. A very charming & sensitive story."
4,"Real, honest and thought provoking","I am surprised by the negative reviews on this book. I thought Jewel was a very real person with very real emotions. So many of us mothers would sacrifice all (marriage, our other children - less needy, and our own desires) to pursue what we felt was best for a needy child. I understood Jewel pulling away from Leston with only one goal in mind - to give Brenda Kay the vey best she could! The guilt she experiences towards her other children is also very real. Jewel recongnises that she has not given them the best of herself, but will do nothing to change that, all for the sake of her disabled daughter.A good read, and a book that will stay with me for some time to come!"
3,Mediocre. Uninspiring.,"I thought it was fine. It wasn't bad enough to quit, but it didn't captivate me either. Excessive typos were annoying. Mr. Lott should find another editor."
3,has it flaws,"This wasn't a bad book and it wasn't a very good book; it had its strong points as well as its weak points. I chose to read this book for a class of mine. The weakest point of the book was the constant use of the ""n"" word, especially in the first half of the book, it was the worse, it was used on nearly every page, and more than once. I almost put the book down because of this. The stronger points of the book, was the character of Brenda Kay, I think the author did do a good job with her characterization. The book was a bit slow moving at times too."
4,An excellent book-for those who can relate...,"I have read several of the reviews of this book, especially the negative ones to which I must respond. I spent most of my childhood in rural Arkansas with my grandmother. All her life, she was poor financially, but rich in family. However, the family relationships were unique, unspoken, treasured. Poverty shadows expression--partly because of lack of education, but also in effort to hide what you lack. It makes you hard, proud, quiet, and ironically makes love stronger. For me, this entire book took place at my grandmother's house. Jewel's children remind me of my aunts and uncles who grew up poor, struggling for beds to sleep in as children, but as adults, closer than any family I have ever met. I think this book is a superb example of a challenged family. But if you do not relate to the background, the social disposition, you may not get how precious every day-as expressed in this book-is."
2,Starts good then becomes a job.,"I enoyed the beginning where the story shifts between Jewel as a child and Jewel as a young mother. However, after Brenda Kay's diagnosis, the book took a serious dive for me. I applaud the dedication that Jewel gave her daughter, but much of the text was so incredibly mundane and boring, I am still searching for the point.Leston made me want to scream with his pathetic attitude and Jewel's submission to Leston at the cost of her daughter's education was hard to take.After ""Jewel"" and ""The Reader"" I am about to boycott Oprah's picks, and thinking that I could write a book at least this good and get rich. I have to say, I haven't been moved by a book since reading ""Redeeming Love"" by Francine Rivers. Read it, you'll be glad you did."
4,"A tender, compassionate story about a mother and daughter.","I was most impressed with Bret Lott's story of this woman who receives a most unusual gift from God. Not only does Lott transport the reader back into the mid 1900s, he also transports them into Jewel's family and innermost feelings. Those who feel this book is too ""wholesome"" or ""boring"" may not be reading enough into Lott's descriptive language and pervasive metaphors. I found this book truly enjoyable, and would recommend it to anyone!"
3,OK,"The book's okay, but I got rather confused sometimes by the meanings behind some of the phrases the author uses. Sometimes I don't understand the point the ""heroine"" is trying to make. I am also a little confused by the ending. However I thought it was quite an enjoyable book, and it wasn't boring, most of the time. I like the descriptions used."
1,Depressing,"Yes, this author is a good writer but wow....what is the point? Very depressing.... This book was a very hard read for me."
3,Good Book... Very SLow start..,I really liked this one... Action. Suspense. It had it all.. If you liked Desperation. you'll love this one.. check it out.
2,What-Ever???????,"My God, what a laborious read! Certainly the worst of Oprah's choices to date. A very slow and deliberate read only to be disappointed at the end. .. straight through to the Epilogue, a consistent disappointment. The story line had so much potential. I was looking forward to being transported to an experience of a family with a Downs Syndrome child. What I got was a sophomoric attempt to massage the heart into actually feeling something for these persona-less characters and their lives. In my opinion, Lott didn't do this subject matter justice at all."
3,An OK book....,"I disagree with the readers who hated this book. While not great literature, it has a readable story. I don't think that the character Jewel was off the mark for someone in her situation. I was a little puzzled by Jewel's tendancy sometimes to speak in an uneducated way. Afterall, she was supposed to have been trained as a teacher. The book has a bit of a tearjerker quality about it. Nonetheless, reading it was still a better use of time than watching television would have been."
1,Terrible!,This was a terrible book. I could barely make it through to the end. The constant rehashing of the same events over and over was pitiful. This book could be improved by cutting it from 500 pages of redundancy down to two hundred!
4,inspiring,I find this book very inspiring..It came to my life just at the right time. It is also very educational because concepts that are deep and spiritual are written in such a way that is highly understandable.
3,Interesting but has limitations,"This book has a lot of interesting information about stages of spiritual growth and the experiences one encounters on the path. However, the philosophy behind the book has limitations. Specifically, the beginning of chapter 8 describes three states of human consciousness: waking, dreaming sleep and dreamless sleep. In the yoga literature is described a fourth state, superconsciousness, which is a state transcending the three other states. I have been practicing mediatation with the Yoga Sutras system for 28 years. It maps out states of consciousness from normal waking state to pure consciousness without an object. Although Steiner is fun to read, his system has limitations and there are better systems around."
4,It will really help you with those angles,"Is a great tool to find those odd angles and make the right cuts done right the first time, just practice on scraps before till you get a feeling of the tool."
4,Starrett ProSite,This is a real handy tool. The angles were right on. I used it to layout some oak mouldings I was installing on a staircase project. It really saved time as the saw was in the garage. Eliminated lots of trial cuts for odd angles. I wish I had it for a kitchen crown moulding job. Cabinet boxes were not all 90 degrees! Only downside --- should come with a carrying case!!
3,FINE FOR ANYTHING BUT INSIDE CORNERS,It's a great tool except if you want to get a true angle from the inside corner. I bought a $4 plastic protractor that did what I thought this should have done. Because of the inside corners on drywall you cannot get a true reading unless you get the protractor exactly in the corner. this one will not do that and therefore you can get bad miters because of it.Outside corners and just about anything else it is about as good as you can get.
3,"Nice Idea, Falls Short","This book would translate well into a movie, mostly action/adventure. But the book itself seems to lack emotional depth and character depth. It's good for passing the time, but not something I would list as a ""great"" novel. However, I will say that the Butterfly Room and the scene between Charlie and Esme in the Butterfly Room where he tries to impress her was one of the most dazzling scenes I have read in a long time."
5,Great Electric Airpot with reasonable price!!!,It is a friendly user device. It works great with reasonable price.
5,"Great product, highly recommended","I highly recommend this water pot. I had mine over 12 years and it is still going strong. One pump will give me a full cup of water. I only thing I have to replace is the rubber sealing ring around the inner lid (about $15 including s/h). Other than that, this product out performed my expectations in every way. I highly recommend it."
3,Not what I'd hoped,I got the book because I had liked his old poker training manual...Poker a guaranteed income for life. That book is great and I was hoping that this was a fictionalized version of that. And it more or less was. But the background story was really weird. So if you are a fan of his manual it still is a book you would want to read. Just plan to be disappointed in the writing about stuff that happens away from the poker table.
1,Fall apart too quickly,"I have had two pairs of these and they are comfortable, but the first pair only lasted 6 months of casual wear before the heel stitches came undone and the second pair only made it one month before the stitching in the heel came undone and the rubber on the sole came unglued. For the price and being sperrys i expect better quality. I love the look and comfort but will not buy anymore because they just dont last long enough."
4,Great workout,Great videos!! Great workout and you can't beat the price. I am starting to see results after doing this for a few weeks
4,Good Purchase,Perfect for beginners and gives a full body workout. No need to worry about injuring yourself while burning calories. Would purchase again
5,good value & excellent instruction,TURN VOLUME DOWN & WATCH EACH DISC UNTIL YOU'VE MASTERED THEM.YOU MUST PRACTICE & PERFECT EACH MOVE BEFORE GOING TO NEXT ONE.
3,Liddy is right - But!,"The book is a good, quick read. Except for the relatively new information in regards to the ""true facts about Watergate"", to me ,it's preaching to the choir. Any true conservative already understands what is needed to get the country back on track. If you are a liberal,however, it's a must read.I think Liddy would have been well advised to omit chapter 6 entitled ""Of Men and Women"". It's a bit silly and hopefully not reflective of his personal life."
1,RETURN OF THE RATMAN,ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE NOT AS FREE AS WE MIGHT BE IS MR LIDDY & HIS ILK OF RAT'S ... REPUBLICANS....DON'T GET ME WRONG....I LIKE GORDON --HE IS ONE OF MY FAVORITE RAT'S....
1,"Unless You Were Black, Female, Jewish or Gay","I grew up a straight, white, male Christian in the same area that Liddy grew up in and at the same time. I remember a country in which blacks could not vote in many states, in which women would lose the few jobs they were allowed to have if they were preganant, in which Jews were excluded from many businesses, schools and social activities and in which gays were confined to the closet.In 1964 I remember that I couldn't get in to Yale despite having 300 points more on my SAT and a much better GPA than George Bush, who got in on an affirmative action program for rich New England WASPs.Mr. Liddy paints a rosy picture because he is looking through rose-colored glasses.America today, even under Bush, is much freer than the America Liddy and I grew up in."
1,Interesting but narrow view of America,"Liddy wants his readers to believe America was a better place when blacks had no rights, women were subservient to men and people could wear guns, just like they wore hats.Liddy is a right-wing extremist whose views will delight those who agree, and appall those who disagree."
2,David Ritz: Get over yourself,"Writing about an incredible man does not make an incredible book. While Ritz has managed to compile a rich set of interviews, his execution is disappointing. This self-endulgent, arrogant piece is not worthy of its subject."
5,Great book about an even greater musical genius.,"David Ritz did a wonderful job at portraying one of the greatest entertainer of all time. He was able to recount all of Gaye's troubles and how this reflected with Gaye's brilliance as a musical genius. It was so sad and tragic to read Gaye's unending strugle with his inner demons, his fear of performing and of his own self, who never really was ever content with his life, dispite all that he'd accomplished. Ritz recounted all this in a masterful way and evokes images that is tragic, sad and at times brilliant, just like Marvin Gaye's life."
1,Lousy sound quality,"I love Spearhead and have purchased almost everything they've put out however, the lousy sound quality featured on this DVD makes me wish I had skipped this purchase."
2,Try as I might I just couldn't connect,"I very much wanted to have this book draw me in but it didn't. After a hundred pages of build-up I hadn't actually met the main player and had been side-tracked to places I just didn't want to digress to. Oh yes, it had promise, as does the author, but please Ms. Malarkey, be less tricky and more direct as you have talent. A good book if you are stuck in east Africa with only a travel guide but otherwise look elsewhere."
2,Check before buying.,This was way too loud. Wasted $200 on this mistake.Should have called the factory before buying to see what is recommended for my vehicle. Paid for $100 muffler then paid muffler shop $50 to install then drove 5 miles and figured out this was way too loud to even hear the radio. Then paid $50 to take it off and re-install original factory muffler. Called factory and they said this was too short of a muffler for my vehicle. Lesson--- ask the experts before buying. Muffler quality is very good and would recommend this particular brand.
2,Species-The Awakening,"God, what a terrible movie. Since when has a ""Species"" movie had only 2 sex scenes [in it]? This is truly ridiculous. Not to mention, the DVD isn't even high-quality, either. I recommend seeing the others in this series (or ""Decoys"", which has a better sense of humor) instead of this one!"
1,Down and out,"The Species series once again hits the direct to DVD market with Species IV: The Awakening, this time featuring uber-hottie Helena Mattsson as the sexy alien/human hybrid on the hunt for a mate, and leaves a bloody path of destruction in her path. Anyone who remembers when the Species series debuted will recall how much of an enjoyable guilty pleasure the first film was, which followed with a sub-par sequel. Species III would be the first of the series to direct to DVD, and was absolutely horrible, but Species IV takes the cake. It just seems here that no imagination at all was put into the film, and the film's formula of sexy alien killer isn't just tired at this point, it's just plain boring, which also sums up the whole movie. Mattsson is incredibly gorgeous, and it's good to see genre veteran Ben Cross here (he's the only actor here who actually seems to know what he's doing; big shock there), but nothing can make up for the yawn fest that develops once the film starts. Avoid."
2,The worst Species movie,"I liked the other 3 Species movies, but not this one. I don't think it's worth taking the time to explain the plot. I'll just keep it short and honest. This is a really lame movie. Don't waste your money."
4,had to ship back,"This product arrived after I had left for vacation. The seller was quick to respond for my shipping the product back and getting refunded. I have had Dr. Martins in the past (this same sandal), but I like this particular model; they feel very comfortable on my feet."
