5,My nephew loved it,"My nephew loved this, it was over priced for what I found later, but, I got it delivered to my home, and didn't have to go out looking for it."
5,Perfect Bird Feeder Brushes,I am so pleased with my hummingbird feeder brushes. All three are the perfect size for the task of keeping my feeder clean.
2,Too soft,"Disappointed. Small brush is too big for the flower holes, the medium brush broke soon after purchase and the long bottle brush is too soft to do any good. I do like the length of the long brush, just needs to be stiffer. The small brush is a good idea, but a little smaller would be nice. I have 8 hummingbird feeders and have to clean every week. Thought this would be the answer to a very time consuming job. Guess I go back to the baby bottle and toothbrushes."
5,I love it,"These brushes work perfectly in the hummingbird feeder. Makes cleaning the feeders so much easier and less messy. The large brush especially, gets all the way down to the bottom."
3,Brushtech B122C Feeder Cleaning Kit,"Not all of brushes in this kit work for every feeder I own, but they do work on some plus the price was right and you know what they say... you get what you pay for, so in this case this would be true!!!"
1,Very disappointed,I received this yesterday but when I went to use it I found the brushes are all to large for my three feeders. The feeders are all different in shape and size.
5,replacing my old one,replacing my old one after from car wash knock my other one off i guess the weather and everything gotten to it and weeken it lol o well be good as new like nothing never happen
5,Top Notch Deal!,"I've had this LCD monitor for 1 year now using it all day long with my main computer. Don't be put off by the goofy attachments, this is an excellent monitor for the price. I am thoroughly satisfied and happy I chose this one, so if I were looking for a replacement I would definitely check out one of the latest versions. I believe they make a 7550 pro version now, or something like that. But the one I've got shows no signs of wear, so I'm sure I'll have it for a long time to come. And actually, if I had this on a normal desk, I might even use the goofy attachments. Why not? Might be fun."
3,Diappointing interpretation of beautiful work,"I have enjoyed von Karajan's interpretation of previous recordings but was disappointed with this recording. Dohnanyi's recording with the Weiner Philharmoniker(Decca) has much more intensity, depth and sound quality, with better soloists."
1,HE is not a nutritionist and not a Doctor,This book like all his books are poor written copy of other books that cover diet and nutrition in a much more thorough manner. If you want a good diet see the American Heart Association diet for free or the American Diabetes Association.I wouldn't believe the other people who wrote reviews of this stuff.
3,Someone Fibbed,"I bought this book along with the Lean Bodies series of books because another reviewer had said there were great, and descriptive exercises that could be done at work. Yeah, sure, if you happen to work in a gym! The ideas are basically the same as Lean Bodies -in fact the authors worked together at some time, and even tell the same story in each of their books. This book has a little more lenient food lists, which may be a bit more realistic to follow."
1,So Tight,"Have you ever owned a pair of headphones that were so tight they were painful? If not, then this pair might be for you. I've tried flexing them to try and stretch them out, to no avail. I don't think I have an exceptionally large head, but these things are so uncomfortable I can't use them. Stay away."
2,Poor Antenna ability,"The Maxell NB-201 Stereo Line Neckband Headphones perform fine in every way except that they do not act well at receiving radio signals. For those who intend to use a headphone on an MP3 player with a radio, it is best to pass on this item."
3,Neck band,I made a mistake and didn't realize these are the types of headphones that go around your neck and not the top of your head. The neck band is not adjustable so I think these would probably fit a man better. The neck band sticks out really far if you have a smaller head/neck so don't get these if you plan to sit back with them on. But the actual phones are good.
4,Good quality for price but...,"I got these to replace my broken work ones. They were so cheap I got two and my shipping was still more expensive. The sound quality is very good for the price. My main complaint is the shortness of the cord. It barely reaches from the laptop on my desk to my head. If you're using these with an MP3 player in your pocket or something, you should be fine. Otherwise, you might need to buy an extension cable that would probably cost more than the actual headphones.EDIT: After a week of using them, the left headphone died. They were cheap enough that I ordered two at the time, so hopefully it was a fluke and this one will last longer. Otherwise I can't really recommend these to anyone. I'd give 'em about 2.5 stars right now because they are a little tight around the head for long usage sessions (but I've got a big head too)..."
2,"Very tight fit, poor audio, good for books","Forget these for music - the audio quality is poor. I use them just for books while walking. And they are very tight - maybe best suited for a child or petite person. But on the plus side - cheap and sturdy. If that sounds right for you, go for it!"
4,Great for Church Nursery,We used this item in our renovated church nursery to the delight of our church children.
4,Low Budget Horror Flicks,"I bought the 8 Movies: Midnight Horror: Terror & Torment at my local Walmart for $5.00, which isn't bad for five movies.The eight movies are:The ProphecyThe Gingerdead ManScarecrowHowling IV: The Original NightmareHindsightDisturbedCruel WorldInsideI already owned the DVDS of The Prophecy and the Scarecrow. I only bought this for the Howling IV (which I recall seeing as a kid) and The Gingerdead Man (I have heard of it, but I have never seen it.) I have never heard of the other four movies on this 2 disc set.Besides from The Prophecy, the movies are low-budget horror flicks. The majority of them are slight below average, but a few are fun to watch."
1,not so good,"This was sent to my granddaughter and she indicated that it arrived, but there was NO GLUE in the pen. Trying to send it back is kind of impossible as she lives in another town and is getting ready to move to Virginia where her husband will be based at Fort Lee.."
1,Dried Out,I purchased this stick a few months earlier. When I opened the package it was completely dried out. I will not buy this product again.
2,Not Ron's Best Work,"Contrary to the above reviews, I don't believe this album is a true indication of Ron's immense talent. I found the songwriting to be no where near as insightful as on previous albums (with one or two exceptions) and the music lacks the emotive elements that I have come to expect from Ron. Having been a huge fan for many years, I await any Ron Sexsmith release or tour to Australia with great anticipation and expectation. Unfortunately this effort has not delivered.I surely hope that Ron is not under some contractual obligation where he is required to release a new album every 18 months or so - If that is the case, I also hope that his record label becomes more receptive to the notion that quite often, less is more."
5,An excellent analysis of the needs of part time athletes!,"I liked Nancy Clark's book for two reasons. First, I appreciated her clear and concise presentation of the information. Second, the way she used scientific studies, etc. to back up her conclusions appealed to me. As a part time triathlete, I refer to this book by her and others by Covert Bailey as my primary reference tools on nutrition."
5,Great!!!,"Thank Heavens for the beauty of having sight! Now, let's add sound!!. Put the two together, and we have a remarkable remembrance of all things coming together!!!"
4,"Great video, great sound ... no mistery?","This blu-ray has an amazing video, and an incredible well captured sound. Listen to the Lenny White's drum solo ... can you imagine a better and more natural sound of a drum kit? I tought it was on Jeff Beck's blu-ray, great sound, but the drums of RTF is in your room. The only instrument I think could have a better sound is the Stanley Clark's bass ... This better sound of a bass player is in Jeff Beck's blu-ray! I am a litlle sad with RTF because there is no one of the great eletric songs of the album No Mistery !"
4,A Long Awaited Return................Sorta,It was great seeing the band re-united in top form playing together at Montreux.With the new technologies available this blu-ray captures them in a way only dreamt of several years ago.Alas the sound engineering isn't up to the best standards that the DTS HD sound track can offer but it is still quite listenable.The video is great except for the bonus material which is presented in five boxes throughout(very distracting).All in all a must have for any RTF fan
2,Cute but cheap,"The watch is nice looking, but the links are really cheap. The are made of a thin metal and dent very easily."
2,"Beautifully designed, poor quality","Within a week some of the embroidery and hem had come apart on the comforter. The sheets are very cheap feeling, thin, poor quality fabric. Definitely not something I would have purchased if I had laid my hands on in person first, even though it looks beautiful."
1,Does not Read,THe game did not read when it was inserted into a DS Lite and even if the game worked it was boring
5,Esoteric Classic,"Two thumbs up. This work is an esoteric classic. No library should be without a copy. That Alex Grey's work is world-class is a given. His publishers have treated his work like the masterpiece that it is. The paper, the formatting, the typesetting, the binding - all work in concert to showcase the jewel in the crown of Alex Grey's published works. It rarely gets any better than this. P.S. Do yourself a favor and pay the extra for the hardbound version; years down the road, you'll be glad you did."
2,Toast Crumbs,"Toast V6 installed easily and runs as expected. However, on my system, it refuses to COPY any kind of CD or DVD. (Copy protection is not involved.) For my purposes it is almost useless. I will now avoid buying software advertised on the web as [Old Version]."
5,Profound truths for very young hearts,"I have flipped through many devotionals for young children and become very disheartened at the shallow truths and petty applications they offer. This book is sweet in its simple pictures and precious examples of profound Biblical truths. I love that it begins with Romans 5:8. It presents the really important principles that provide a foundation for Christian living - suitable for a preschooler! I also like that it doesn't dress up each one to ""appear"" practical with songs, activities and short-sighted questions. Many activity ideas are offered in the introduction to help you tailor the devotionals for use with different ages and levels of learning. My four year-old and I have had some wonderful discussions over the pages of this book."
2,a very limited selection of Stevens' poetry,"Two words pretty much sum up this collection: PUBLIC DOMAIN. It's only got what is available to reprint for free--Stevens' early poems. Some of these are nice, of course, but unless all you're looking for is Stevens' early poems you'd be better off with ""Collected Poetry and Prose,"" or ""Collected Poems,"" or ""The Palm at the End of the Mind."""
3,The Emperor of Ice-Cream,"This is a resourceful book with a good assortment of Stevens' poetry. There is a decent amount of background on Stevens as well as many of his more influential poems. Overall, this is a good book to add to any poetry collection."
4,Gorey Stories,"In the wrong hands, gore is just nasty. In the right hands, it's *really* nasty. These stories are funny and so far over the top that I got a nosebleed. It's weird to laugh out loud as you're looking at images of intestine baloon animals, but I did. Rather than analyze what that says about me, I'm going to assume that my reaction was normal and that you'll feel the same way. Enjoy!"
2,Not up to Sierra Club's usual standards.,"Adventuring in New Zealand turns out to be a fairly pedestrian travel guide, with little to recommend it. While claiming to be an ""adventuring guide"", there's little more about hiking, parks, fishing, climbing, etc. than any of the standard guidebooks. Design, illustrations, and indexing are second rate. Give this one a miss."
1,Size Matters!,"This item is described as ""compatible with 15"" or larger laptops,"" and the package has the same verbiage. In fact, it measured 1"" too shallow and 3"" too narrow for my Dell Studio 15. It would be akin to using a napkin for a tablecloth: not ""geek chic"" by any means."
4,Soothing,"Very spiritually uplifting. Takes patience to a whole new level. For those seeking spirituality, it bring to the forthfront what faith is all about."
3,nothing to write home about,"There was one swear word at the beginning of the movie--thus, garbage can material. The rest of the movie was ho-hum--unless you want to get a glimpse of how people dressed in the 50s. As I said, I threw it in the garbage can. I cannot have people think that I, as a Christian, condone obscenities since in Ephesians 5 we are told to abstain from all profanity."
3,Pretty Good Considering Shortage of Quality Box Fans,"If you read the box fan comments, here and with the other fans on the Amazon site, you will probably conclude that quality box fans -- metal, relatively quiet, etc -- are getting very scarce. I wanted a metal frame box fan with the older, larger metal blades. The customer photo with this fan faked me out because that fan has those older blades. Mine does not. You should assume that yours will come with the plastic blades. My fan does have a metal housing.Everything arrived today without a hitch. To read some of the criticisms of these new fans, you might think they sound like a World War II air show. This fan is NOT quiet but it is not as loud as I expected. It is also notably lighter than the all metal box fan it replaced.Others have reported poor build quality. Mine seems fine. OK, there is no way this fan was built by some old world craftsman, on break from violin building, but I'm satisfied."
3,not all channels,"when we activate the dish network secvice,we could not get some channels,dish netwirk offer to exchange the reciever.they think that the reciever is a refurbish one."
3,Somewhat disappointed,This book was OK but just that - OK. I was somewhat disappointed upon arrival. Kept it a short while and then gave it away on FREECYCLE. Not enough just good ol' everyday kind(s) of recipes.
2,poor and I like Queensrych,Disc one is goodDisc two is notDon't waste your money on this one.There is much better Queensrych out there.
3,2.5 stars- Missing a few great songs,"How can you make a greatest hits package and not include the song ""Empire""???!!!! And I think that ""Best I can"" was their first video from the album EMPIRE and pretty much a radio hit, where the heck is it??? ""Walk in the shadows"" makes this cd a little bit desirable (I never could figure out which studio album that it came from, or maybe, it's just recorded for the greatest hits package? I'm not sure if they have some previous ""best of's"" or ""greatest hits"" which have the two songs I mentioned on them, but, if they do, I think you should give them a try instead of this poor compilation. But this still could be okay if you don't own any Queensryche whatsoever."
2,"Good enough, but they don't store well ...",I was only able to use about 30 of my last Maxell 48-count package before the remainder started gassing and became ruined with corrosion. Sort of changes your effective price per battery ...
4,A cat called Podkayne and howling ghosts of hyperspace,"Some people think reading is a waste of time.That children's books are worthless junk.I think that a good sci fi classic likeHeinlein's Podkayne of Mars makes them very wrong.This author knows here plots and even mentions a very goodbook as a tv space play for the young central character.It is a mystery of aliens ( good and bad) and artifact smuggling ( very modern today!), but all turns out well in the end.The concepts of Alien art and relative ethno-exo-anthropologyare even touched on. Not bad for a useless kid's book!"
4,Risk II an overall winner,"I enjoy this game immensely and usually play it at least once every day.The most challenging is the same-time mode with extra territories added, and I like Capital Risk and Mission Risk the best. I usually choose at least 3 AI opponents.The only glitch is that sometimes the game will freeze in the middle of a match and you have to quit the game and start over.Also I have not detected much difference in the quality of play of the different AI generals that can be chosen as opponents even though it's supposed that the order of the list goes from easy to more difficult.All in all, though, the game is great fun and quite versatile."
5,Best High holiday recipes,"The recipe for the Crowned apple cake is Awesome!! I make it every year for Rosh Hashana and everyone raves about it. This is just one the many wonderful recipes in this book. The Passover desserts are great, too."
3,Take this book with a grain of salt.,"I bought this book just before Pesach hoping to spice up my seder table, but I'm a little disappointed. I was really put off by Sorosky's carping on and on about how awful her childhood was because her father was Orthodox. I also found many of her ""Extra Points"" entertaining suggestions to be somewhat silly and over the top. What bothered me the most, however, was despite the fact that the author stresses in the introduction that all of her menus and recipes are strictly kosher, I found at least one major kashrut problem within minutes of opening the book (one seder menu begins with a dairy gefilte fish souffle to be followed by chicken soup!). The recipes all look very interesting and the layout is nice and clear, but use with caution!!"
4,Crequillon: Mort m'a prive'...,"Solemn music. How Charles V must have suffered to have comissioned this work. It still haunts to this day. All in all, an excellent effort that is well worth a listen. Check it out! My rating: 4 stars..."
3,Dimal Sound,"I bought this as a replacement for my Nomad Muvo which just died after about a year of use. I really like that it is a flash MP3 players and that there are no internal moving parts, so it won't skip like hard drive based MP3 players. The radio tuner, recorder and display are nice features. Note that these features make the unit slightly larger than the Muvo. The worst thing about Gateway's DMP-310 is its sound quality. It's dismal! I am comparing it to the Muvo which pretty much is built and works in the same way. I expected similar sound quality but it's considerably less even using other headphones (the ones that came with the Muvo). While it may be good for running (no skiping) it's not that good for running on a treadmill (not a loud treadmill at least)."
3,Cheaper at local stores,"This product fills me up and the taste is not bad, BUT you can get this product cheaper at your local stores."
4,Better than most headsets,"These earbuds are the most wearable headsets ever, not to mention the least irritating, and the most durable. Excellent quarlity for inexpensive."
5,Brilliant performance by a Great Chopin Exponent,"I bought this performance on tape some 20 years ago at a Zimerman concert in Berlin and it still rates as the best recording of the Chopin 1 I've ever heard. It's a live recording, reminiscent of the famous Argerich Rach 3 recording and Zimerman's plays with outstanding clarity, a unique brilliance in his sound and virtually flawless technique. The fact that it is a live recording adds a vitality to this performance that you rarely hear in studio recordings and Zimerman's interpretation of Chopin is wonderful. The Concertgebouw Orchestra is at its best and, to my mind, has the greatest Russian conductor at the podium in Kondrashin (look out for his Dvorak symphony recordings as well). Truly the best Zimerman performance out there and certainly amongst the greatest recordings of the Chopin 1!"
1,This book WAS NOT better the second time around,"Very hard to read and understand. Each chapter has Learning Objectives and those LO's are referenced for the questions at the end. The problem is: inside the chapter there is no way to find out what the LO's are!!! Me and a friend tried to figure it out but it was almost impossible. A lot of the chapter questions were very difficult. Several spelling errors that a sixth grader could have found. I had a Managerial Accounting class twice, once as a prerequisite for my graduate degree and I am taking it now for my MBA. Imagine my horror when I discovered that I was using this same book twice. I hope you never get stuck with this turkey of a book."
2,Very narrow subject audiance,Kama Sutra: A Tale of LoveThis is not what 99% of people would think it is Its a subtitled foreign film having little to do with its title.
5,****many stars above the best!,"One of my top 5 favorites of all time. This is a classic, in tune with Dr. Zhivago...timeless, such a romantic movie! I adore it and watch it and Monsoon Wedding often. If you want lusciuos scenery, gorgeous costumes along with a lovely story and wonderful acting, see this film. Yes, there are Other films worth watching for those of us who want more than the latest silly action flick..."
5,Karma Sutra - A Tale Of Love,"I have always loved this film, and if you like love stories you will love it too. The costumes and scenary are beautiful, really makes you want to go there and see India for yourself.I recommend this film to anyone.."
3,Interesting but slightly boring.,"Plot was smart. Marginally entertaining, colorful, costumes, props, and sets where great.I wouldn't spend more than $1.00 on this."
4,kama sutra: a tale of love,"Indra Varma is nice to look at,and a good actress. They tried to cram to much movie into to short of a time period. glad a bought it."
4,A Morning Like This,"The music CD was all I expected it to be; however, it was necessary to play it at a very high volume setting since it could not be understood at a normal setting."
2,Bottom Cracked After 2 Weeks,"It's simple and works, but the plastic isn't strong enough. A crack in the bottom of the cup developed only 2 weeks after I got it."
5,Good Book,I enjoyed this book because it was a honest profile of myself being an ox goddess.I liked how it was more accurate then western astrology. I reccomend this book because it was insightful and accurate at describing me in better way like differnt goddess from differnt areas.
5,Nursing Management Book 3rd Edition: Great!,"The class I am in is using the 4th edition of this book (this is the 3rd)and sell it at the campus bookstore for $48. I found the 3rd edition on Amazon for $0.17. No noticable difference between the two, except the price!"
2,Pinnacle studio 8,I must agree with most of the other reviews that have found problems with the studio products.I have managed to produce some DVDs and VCDs but I find I am always fighting against the bugs and crashes that occur on most projects created.Setting up DVD menus is impossible.Adding a soundtrack causes crashes.Every 3 months I upgrade my version. This solvs a couple of bugs and creates several other problems.The last download I had to manually rename the dlls.The time before I downloaded a 10MB patch that failed to install.The product has lots of potentially good features let down by poor delivery.
4,Very good mouse though not perfect,"My wife was having pain at the base of her thumb and this mouse completely fixed that problem, so we are very pleased with it. Another plus is that this mouse requires almost no learning time to use effectively. The only reasons I didn't score it 5 star are 1) it's a bit big for her hand - she would like a smaller version and I don't think that would be a problem for me, 2) both of us find we're often hitting the 3rd button (which is ""Back"" for browsing), which is a bit annoying. But it's been well worth getting it."
2,Mouse is good but there are problems,I bought this mouse about 2 months ago. It seemed to work fine but after a month and a half my wrist started hurting regularly so I switched back to my trackball. My wrist is fine now. Its very handy with the multiple programmable buttons but the ergonomic part if it doesnt work for me.
5,Don't listen to the bad reviews,"This workout may not have very ""complicated dance steps"" (I thought they were challenging enough) but it is an all-around great workout. You will FEEL it before she gets to the cool-down. Great leg work and upper body. Highly recommended for anyone who's into ""dance""-type cardio. Very fun."
3,Not for the rhythmically challenged,Very difficult rhythms for beginners or teachers without much musical training start on page 8!I do like the order of presentation of notes. Also there are many songs in each chapter to practice the new note presented in that section. Nice format with the built-in easel.Just be aware of the challenging rhythms that are presented right from the very beginning.
3,A little flimsy,"There a few (8) brushes under the CD that clean the lens. After just one use of this product, 2 brushes fell off and are most probably in my CD player.-this product is meant to last 20 uses according to the manual, but based on the above, I have serious doubts about this-hopefully having a brush stuck in my CD player isn't going to do any damageStill giving it 3 stars because it seemed to have worked (discs no longer skip)"
5,Worked Great!,Volvo told us $800 to replace CD player (for the second time). Thought we would try this first. CD player worked great after one cleaning and no problems since. Definately worth the very small investment.
2,No working at all,"Well, before I bought this disc, I noticed some one star comments. Unfortunately, it happened to me as well. There's no different before and after using this cleaning disc. I can play a few discs, but the auto cd-player can not read this disc. It's a sad experience."
3,Why is my laptop slipping off?,"Yes, it looks great and saves space. But why am I the only person who has their laptop slip off at least once a day? I've got the 17"" MacBook Pro and use the no-slip pads. But I struggle with it every day. I've even tried putting it upside down!"
5,Very helpful,"I purchased this a short time ago for my 12"" powerBook. I wanted to be able to ""convert"" my powerBook to a desktop of sorts because I have certain projects that are much easier to work on with a separate keyboard and mouse. The stand lifts the computer to a very convenient vision level. It seems perfectly solid, is easy to move around, but stays put once you've placed it. It fits my powerBook well. I assume it would fit any notebook, though I can't say for sure. I'm very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone who wants to convert their notebook to a desktop."
5,The X-Files complete third season,Ipurchased this for my daughter that was laid up with knee surgery and she loved it and was soo happy that I bought it for her.
1,Horrible,Arrived far too slow. Not what I expected. Almost imposible to read. Not for beginners at all and CD is a bore. The only thing that stoped me from returning this was the fact that it'd be too much of a hassle and too many things could go wrong so I just donated it. It was a complete waste of money.
2,cute but not much fun,I bought this for my 4 year old daughter who loves princesses. She enjoyed pushing all the buttons but was disappointed that the chainge pieces were all attached to eachother. I was disappointed that the play boxes it comes with were made poorly and the drawer was stuck closed. I will be returning this register to the store.
5,Thoughtful and Useful,"""Preaching the Atonement"" is helpful precisely because it is not a work of systematic theology that tries to harominze every teachng in the Bible about the atonement. The writers also provide examples of good sermons on the atonement and give their measured critique of them. I think any preacher will be helped by reading this book, and I've been at the preaching business for over 50 years."
2,Nothing Special,"Nothing special about these headphones. Cheaply made with pool audio quality, I bought similar items at our local discount store for $5."
2,Wanted More Detail,"The map's format seems ideal to the outdoors and bike riding. Unfortunately, it wasn't in sufficient detail. I would prefer a smaller area - and more detail."
1,Knives Digest 1 not worth the money,"Based on Bernard Levine's review of Knives Digest 1, I thought I would be getting a good knife book. What a disappointment. From cover to cover, Knives Digest 1 is substandard. The paper is the lowest quality newsprint I have ever seen in a ""book."" Photo reproduction is terrible and the design, especially the cover, must have been done by an unpaid intern. As for the color photos Mr. Levine touted; if you can't put color pictures on good paper, leave them out. Sure, this book is cheaper than other knife books, but in this case you don't even get what you pay for. It's clear that Mr. Levine doesn't know what he's talking about when it comes to knife books."
1,What a Waste,The case pops out of the clip causing the phone to drop constantly. Already lost a 4 gig memory chip because of the constant dropping. Switching to a new case before my screen Cracks.
3,Good book of ideas,I'm a long time trainer. Lots of ideas and much validation for existing practices. Some of the material is now dated
1,"""I'm Too Good For This Work"" - an alternate title","""Do you dig in the soil for a living? Then, regardless of how important your work is, obviously you're guilty of killing millions of microorganisms and should be ashamed of yourself. I sullied my hands with a shovel once or twice, but I know better now. I'm too good for this work. I must, in good conscience, leave it to the laboring classes."".... Janet Malcolm (an imaginary quote, of course)."
3,An Interesting Read,"This is an interesting meditation on the relationship between writers and their subjects seen through the lens of one lawsuit. While this a smart and original piece of work, I found the ideas to be a little slight for an entire book. If Malcolm had would cut this by a third and then added it to a collection of essays, this piece would have been completely brilliant. I disagree with other reviewers who are basing their opinions on questions of MacDonald's guilt or the personalities involved. To me, those concepts are not part of the points this book is making."
5,LOVE THIS SERIES!!!,"I really like Richelle Mead's writing style. This series, as well as the Vampire Academy series (although it is geared to a young adult audience) is simply spectacular! The Eugenie Markham books are my least favorite - although they aren't too bad. I definitely recommend this series if you like paranormal books and want a change from the typical vampire, werewolf stuff."
2,Meh . . .,"I really wanted to like this book, I really did. But it just didn't click with me. Obviously I'm in the minority, but the names of all the people she introduces confused me for a couple chapters, and then the long narratives between the action that I tended to skip over, I just couldn't get into it. Usually when I start a series, I keep reading, just to see what happens, but with this one, I don't think I have the desire to start the 2nd book."
4,Supernatural Thrillers.,So far I've read the first few chapters and couldn't put down this book. Like it a lot. Georgia Kincaid is one of those rare heroines that I love. Richelle Mead is the next big author in this genre. Also Check Out Vampire Academy by her as well. This author is amazing.
1,don't recommend,I didn't care for this book. Was not interested. Didn't keep my interested at all. Didn't even finish the book.
5,Made me laugh AND cry!,"Just finished Succubus Blues and had to write a review...I loved it. It was fun and sexy and I adored the world Mead created, where good and evil don't fit into neat and tidy boxes. Where people make mistakes and have hope for redemption. The book was exciting and...my favorite part...made me cry. I have to really love characters to have that reaction, and the characters Mead created drew me right in. Thanks for the great read!"
5,DOWN TO THE BONE SUPERCHARGED,"I WAS WONDERING IF THIS CD WAS GOING TO BE AS GOOD AS ALL OF DTTB'S OTHERS.IT IS GREAT!! I LOVE IT !! IF YOU LIKE JAMES BROWN & ROY AYERS, YOU GET AN EXTRA TREAT!!THE CD IS WONDERFUL!! THE MORE I PLAY IT, THE MORE I LIKE IT!! I HAVE SEEN THEM IN PERSON TWICE & KEEP WANTING TO GO BACK!! THEY DON'T BEGIN TO GET THE RECOGNITION THAT THEY DESERVE!!I LOVE THEIR MUSIC!!!DTTB is great in person!! I saw & heard them w/ a full band & they kept you rockin!! If you have a chance to see them live & don't, you are really missing the best!! Corrina Grayson is Great on Supercharged!!"
1,Shockingly awful...,"I thought this CD was the worst. I felt I was at a concert that Down to the Bone wasn't even conscious of. Each piece sounded alike. If it wouldn't cost me to return it, I'd do so gladly.I played it in my car with 3 friends as we were traveling into the City. Their remarks were, ""What/Who the hell is this?"" ""Take that mess off!""Need I say more?"
4,Nice dies for new baby greeting cards,"This Cuttlebug die cuts out several shapes that are useful on new baby greeting cards. It's the perfect size for an A2 card (5.5""x4.25""). See customer image for an example of a card where I used the 'baby' phrase. I usedLiquid Pearls Glue .5 Ounce Bottle - Baby Blueto color the letters, then backed them with a piece of yellow paper. I also used the baby bottle die for the interior of the cardYou will probably want to cut these dies from some kind of flesh-colored paper (I used ivory) because of the baby face die. You can always color in the baby carriage, safety pin, etc., or cut them from a separate piece of paper."
4,Essential for Fans,"To see and hear Chick et al back together in 2008 was a real treat, and this DVD captures the moment quite well. The title ""Returns"" is an apt description, much better than ""reunion"" as the latter term conjures up images of some old geezers cashing in on former glory. Now these guys do look like old geezers, but their playing is as fresh and vital as ever. A bit more mellow and mature, but no less exciting and no less mind-blowing in some sections, particularly Al and Stanley. My only complaint with the performance is that the spotlight solos are a little over the top and detract from ""The Romantic Warrior"".The DVD includes all the songs that became part of the standard repertoire on the tour and plays like a complete concert. The bonus footage is a bit disappointing because it is all presented as a video collage: several smaller windows each showing a different camera angle with some funky dividers that are quite distracting. Otherwise the DVD looks and sounds great."
5,RETURN TO PERFECTION,When RTF came into Philly the air was so tense you hardly noticed the summer heat.This was the latter part of the tour and the band seemed a little out ....This show is much better and the band had not lost an inch.They are so tight and in control on this set that you may think you are listining to the record.They are enjoying themselves on stage and it shows.Everyone in the Band is a superstar and the playing and mucicanship is flawless .RTF was one of the last fusion bands to put out a live dvd and it was worth the wait.
4,Just like the end of summer...,"I put this book up and down over several months - and that was mostly an effect of the power of certain segments of the book.The stories move through overlapping lives - and relationships. Universally overcoming their own obstacles - molestation, racismn, sexuality, living and dying... realizing one is aging. Strong and weak - the characters feed off of each other and show a need for one another even at their stubbornest moments.Nina is the main character - but I aim to tell you - so that you give him your undivided attention - the real story is her little dog (who seems to have no name).The book is strongest in the final two chapters - Chapters from A Dog's Life and Block Party. I smiled hard and cried harder through the final movements between Nina and her dog.We are all witnesses to their ceremony..."
5,Correction- you can use a 4GB CF card.,"I bought a 4GB CF card from Amazon and it works extremely well EXSPECIALLY,for movies. With a 4GB CF Card, I have put approximately 4-6 fulln lenght movies depending on the amt of minutes the movie is of course. I have spoke to technical support myself and the woman I spoke with said that was fine. I am not going to repeat, but it is everything the first two reviewers said that it is. A wonderful Stocking Stuffer- hint, hint, hint:o)"
4,A Heavy Metal Queen,"If you like heavy metal and Queen, you owe it to yourself to check this out! With a singer that is a dead ringer to Freddie Mercury and a song writing style that sounds like what Queen would write if they went heavy metal!"
4,"fascinating images, brilliant photography","The book, including photographs from a number of the bestcontemporary photographers, illustrates the allure and drawof the paragon of the ""waif"" models, Kate Moss, whose visagehas become a staple of current cultural images. The picturestrace her development as a model from early advertisements tothe more recent appearances in CK and Obsession. Candidsand proof strips round out the collection and add a dimensionof intimacy. The easily offended should beware, as manyof the photographs are nudes or semi-nudes.Though there are a number of previously unpublishedphotographs to entice the inveterate Kate Moss fan, the bookitself is almost completely images. The short text introductionto the collection seems haphazard, and far more interestingwould have been to include photographers' comments on theirphotographs and experiences working with Kate. Still, no onewill be disappointed with the images themselves, which areflawlessly executed and presented."
5,Nothing Like It!,"How can the feelings evoked by Marvin's Room be put into words? I'm not sure that they can, in fact.This movie is one of the most unique that I have ever seen. It is handled in a way that is touching and real; the heart in this movie is truly genuine. Leonardo DiCaprio is a wonderful actor who creates another brilliant portrayal of yet another troubled youth in ""Marvin's Room"" but the credit in this movie really belongs to the sisters, played by Diane Keaton and Meryl Streep. I have been a long-time fan of both actresses, but this movie is truly the starring moment for both of them.The beauty of ""Marvin's Room"" is in it's simplicity. There is nothing forced about this movie, and it seems to flow directly to the heart from the heart. Whether or not you are a fan of the stars of this movie, I have no doubt that you will be able to enjoy this film for what it is and for the heart and the feeling that have been put into it."
1,expired product,"The product was expired, which was unfortunate, as we gave this as holiday gift to parents that fondly remember the brand and were sad it went off shelves. I suppose I didn't ask but still feel it's not full disclosure to list/sell expired product."
5,Great! Where's the sequel?,"I really love this book. Unlike other 'how to draw' animal books, the artist shows the initial sketch and the finished painting. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in learning to draw Canids.This book is not for beginners though. It definately assumes you know how to draw and does not instruct you in basic drawing technique. That being said, the book is designed to prep you for painting some of nature's most fantastic creatures... wolves.My only quibble with this book, is that I would've like to see more sketches and 'turn around' style pictures of wolves sketched from various angles, and perhaps a sketch started at the beginning and progressing through to its finished stage. I learn a lot from drawing in this manner, and it is a challenge to draw the faces of wolves and place their ears correctly. (my dog is a poor substitute) GRIN.This is a great book. I plan on looking up more books in this series!"
1,Wish I'd read the reviews.,"The tracks listed on Amazon aren't the real songs. Don't understand why someone would deceive customers. I'm just going to send it back.In 1972, Mouth and MacNeal released a fun little album called How Do You Do. The single of the same name was catchy and fun. The rest of the songs on the album were the same, catchy and fun, each song clocking in around three minutes, as was typical of the era. It was an album I listened to many times.Unfortunately, this is not that album. It does have How Do You Do, Tell Me World and Hey, You Love but not the rest of the songs from the original album."
3,Moon guidebooks vary quite a bit!,"I usually buy Lonely Planet or Moon guidebooks for US travel. Often I carry both. Lonely Planet books tend to be very straightforward and consistent, often the product of a ""committee"" of authors. Moon's books seem more conversational in tone and are the product of one or two authors and therefore can vary more in style. I usually prefer Moon books to Lonely Planet due to their more descriptive nature. This is not one of them. This book lacks the imagination in style that most Moon books have. Planning a trip to Oregon? Go Lonely Planet."
5,What a great romp through 40s teenage-dom!,"A great get-away film! Funny, cute, filled with music and high school drama. A total matinee blitz...get your popcorn. I've watched it so many times and still enjoy it, a classic post-war yarn."
4,An excellent case study of interethnic relations,"Bringa, a lecturer of social anthropology at Bergen University of Norway, conducted extensive fieldwork over a period of six years in a mixed Croat-Muslim village in Central Bosnia. Through careful ethnography she has observed the ways in which such concepts as ""ethnos"", ""nation"", and ""religion"" were understood by, and effected the Bosnians with whom she studied. She demonstrates the complexities of interethnic relations on a micro-level. This study helps question overarching theories of nationalism, which exaggerate the difference between different nations. This study is detailed, well-researched and well-written. Despite its detail, it can be highly recommended for anybody working on or interested in Bosnia, former Yugoslavia and interethnic relations."
5,It was the best yet!!!!,"I've read all of the Nancy Drew On Campus books ,but this was the ultimate! It really grabbed my attention! It was romantic how Micheal and Nancy fell in love , but it was also funny how they were always fighting. Yet, it was a cliff hanger because of the car wreck. At first, I didn't think they would get together , but it all worked out! I can't wait untill the next issue , so I can find out what happens. If anyone wants to email me about this or another book they think is good , my email address is mlward@sheltonbbs.com"
1,lili? LILI????,"Why on Earth bother?M. Jeunet's folly? OR is this a tiresome continuation of the infinite RED and GREEN period [worked well in the previous excursions, but give it a break!]Pass this one please - and a comparison to Audrey Hepburn? [Audrey and Leslie Caron hold this patent.]Shame! This one is really unintelligible - regress to ""Children of Paradise"" - now that's original.BETTER still - do see ""Lili"" or ""Story of Three Loves"" - BY far superior to this over-indulgent little saga of fromage du jour......"
1,"Cutesy, at best","The filmmakers seem desperate to capture the viewer's attention. Perhaps I should have been impressed by the use of bold colors and surprised by the presentational style. But I wasn't. Unfortunately, those gimmicks don't distract from the thin storyline and beige characters: quirky gal looks for Mr. Right and interacts with her eccentric friends. Yawn.If, by chance, this film is intended as a parody of art-house films, then it sort of succeeds. Luckily, I only wasted a few bucks by renting it."
1,Never received from vendor.,I contacted the vendor but received no response when the item didn't arrive. It is now over a week late. I received no response from the vendor. I then contacted Amazon and have received no response yet from Amazon either.
1,I hate narrating! The narrator's voice sounded so annoying!,"If I new it was going to be subtitles and narrating I would have avoided it all together. First 20 minutes and I just couldn't watch anymore. The scenes were kind of dull. I do not like foreign films and this one didn't change my opinion. I go to a movie to relax and enjoy and let it do all the work to entertain me. I don't want to have to squint and concentrate and rush reading so I can understand the storyline. It just gave me a headache and I was instantly turned off. If I want to read I will get a book. On top of everything else the narrator's voice(male - creepy old man) sounded so dam annoying. I thought this was going to be a charming feel good movie with a sweet girl and nice accents in some nostalgic little quaint village and interesting people who got a second chance at happiness. Who knows, maybe when I get patience or desparate I'll give this movie a 2nd chance."
5,Amelie WILL change your life,"Jean-Pierre Jeunet, the brilliant director behind ""Delicatessen,"" ""City of Lost Children"" and ""Alien: Resurrection"" comes back in 2001 with a fable that's as close to reality as you'd ever want it to be. ""Amelie,"" also known in French as ""The fabulous destiny of Amelie Poulain"" takes place in Paris, the city where an innocent and angel-like girl grows to become a good-doer, much in a style similar to the movie ""Pay it forward"" from 2000. However the storyline is totally unconventional, filled with her daydreaming depicted in very original and fun ways, and with unexpected turns as she goes about her good deeds. At one point she finds herself caught in pursuing what's best for others, while being afraid to pursue happiness for herself.In times of uncertainty and was such as these, where everyone is in dire need of a positive message, this movie is it. You will love this movie, and as its poster reads ""she'll change your life."""
5,How do you say...Cute as a Button.,"Cute story, visually riveting. The actors all put so much into their perfomances and it captivates you."
4,What a shame!,"This otherwise wonderful movie has been spoiled by two very explicit sex scenes, which it could have really done very well without. The story of Amelie is a touching one. She is very lonely but is persuing a young man in a very unorthodox, shy manner, since she senses he could be her true love. In the meantime she does things anonymously to help others. This movie would have received five stars from me, were it not for the sex scenes, which do somehow ruin it, at least for me."
2,What a disappointment.,"After reading the endless rave reviews here I was eager to experience this charming, delightful film. Well, I managed to watch the first hour and fifteen minutes before giving up on it. Yes, it looks beautiful, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one. I guess I'm a Phillistine or something, but wow, this is one *boring* movie. I dozed off several times and had to rewind the DVD to see if I had missed anything interesting, but I hadn't. Even after over an hour I still didn't care the slightest bit about anyone or anything in the movie, so I just took it out of the player.My recommendation: if you must see this, rent, don't buy!"
5,Love this movie.,"Five stars because: the piano music is excellent. The part where Amelie rides her motorbike at the end is cool. The guy who works at the fruit stand is funny, especially when he talks to the glass man about his boss. A woman jumps off a church and lands on Amelie's mother. Amelie has a fish whose name is Blubber. And one more reason: Nino. This guy is oblivious, just like Amelie, which makes him cool."
1,Why put a movie on DVD?,"There are a number of reasons for using the DVD format... They allow for all types of features to suit all types of viewers...One Feature that is a MUST for foreign language films is to have a language track for the intended audience... This DVD lacks that basic feature and made initial viewing less than enjoyable... I guess, once I learn French or am able to retain the written dialog for the entire movie, I will enjoy the movie upon further viewing...The makers of ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" Did their DVD the right way and I recommend that all makers follow that example..."
5,Paris magic!,"This was a sweet, charming, funny movie. If you've seen Delicatessen. you'll recognize the colors and quirky humor. Aimelie finds an old tin of treasures from a boy who lived in her apartment years ago. This leads her on an odyssey of meddling into the lives of those around her. She surreptitiously makes the woman at the tobacco stand and a regular at the restaurant where she works aware of one another's charms. She manages to maneuver them into a tryst in the bathroom and, like Delicatessen, the earth moves for more than just the lovers. The mischef she dishes out to the vegetable vendor on the corner is wonderfully clever. Her biggest challange is to overcom her own shyness and apply the special magic she is spreading around Paris to her own life. For two hours of sheer delight, this movie can't be beat!"
5,Art at its finest!,"""Amelie"" is a unique visual and entertaining experience unmatched. The story, characters, casting, cinematography, etc. are all excellent. Every moment of the film is worth watching."
5,GREAT MOVIE,"I absolutely love this movie. One of the best movies I've ever seen. ""Amelie"" delivers all what you expect from a ""great movie""."
5,Oh the Pain!,"How hard it was watching this film come to an end. I wanted to stay there--in that place the film created and drew me into. I wanted more of everything! More music! More gorgeous images of Paris! More workdays at the Two Windmills! More conversations with the Glass Man! More of Amelie's life!!If you think about it, we're all like that blind man she takes on a whirlwind tour of a Paris street, rapidly describing the world around her.I can't imagine *not* owning this DVD."
4,"Im sure it was all intersting, but...","The movie itself was like a breath of fresh air into a stuffy, smoke filled room. The DVD was a little hard to navigate. The larger the screen you are watching the easier it will be. The menu selections on this 2 DVD set are small and cramped. Plenty of special features, though I wish they had bothered to subtitle them. Many scenes such as the outtakes are only in french. Sure I knew what was going on and what was supposed to happen, but I think they would of been more fun had I known what everyone was saying or what they all found so funny.I would recommend renting before you buy it. This film was not for everyone and this DVD does not warrant owning if you didnt like the film."
2,Favourite Movie,This is my favourite movie ever. Amelie is the sweetest person and her good deeds are inspiring. I felt so great after watching this movie that I was utterly speechless. I think i'm going to watch it again tonight!
5,I wish I could give Amelie 10 stars,I'm not the type of person to cry during a movie but by the end of Amelie I was on the verge of tears. The movie's hopeful message is so uncommon in anything in life much less in the movies that I felt genuinely moved.
2,Stereotypic French film,"Are all French films the same? This plot was predictable and not that enticing. I didn't find this uplifting (If this is uplifting, I don't want your life.) either, but was amazed at how many people there are with no life. If this is the French idea of sex, how boring! If this is a typical French life, ditto!"
5,A very good French comedy,"Only the French, it would seem, can make films like this.Can someone post other French films that are like this?Because I want to know."
1,too long and boring,I fell asleep when I was watching it. It's too slow and boring. Why do people highly rate this movie?
3,Thoughtful foriegn film,"As with many foriegn films you have to leave your brain turned on. Its not a mindless free ride like so many Hollywood movies these days. However, this is not one of those confoundingly weird French films either. It has a story line that you can understand without having just completed film school. The movie is actually quite humorous and very original. Also, if you are familar with Jung's theory of synchronicity you may find some sequences in this film particularly interesting."
5,Cinema Verite' ?,"This is a wonderful, sparkling gem of a movie, with many facets.It is a realistic slice of Parisian life, with scenes in empty subway stations, apartment rooms,bistros, courtyards and parks. It is a quirky romantic tale of a woman getting to know herself and finding her soul mate. It is also a montage of vignettes about people in Amelie's everyday world. These characters are portrayed so well that one finds themself drawn not only to Amelie, but to these others as well. We care about what happens to them all. Finally, and most uniquely, this movie reflects a deep truth. Amelie decides to slowly change her world, by performing little acts of kindness for those people around her. These impish, amusing plots of tenderness are well thought out, and do impact other lives. The viewer seems to hover over these minute events, and then witnesses with cosmic eyesight, how something much grander unfolds. It is a rare movie which entertains and edifies. ""Amelie"" is such a movie."
1,Disappointing,"The only reason I saw this movie was for extra credit in my French class. The plot is interesting (and weird) but was very poorly executed. The acting is very bad, because it is poorly written. I would advise against seeing this movie; in theaters or when it comes out on video. It is a waste of time. Definitely overrated."
1,Horrible,"This movie should never be watched by anyone. It is just that bad. This movie is to a straight man as a high pitched shrill siren is to an eardrum.Unless sending it to a mortal enemy, don't. Just don't. Buying this only encourages people who make crap like this."
5,I love this movie,It is so light-hearted in tone and fun to watch. The traveling gnome is great as wellViewer in Missouri
5,Most Interesting Movie,I loved this movie. It was really strange and awkward which kept me interested in it the whole time. It's a very sweet movie.
2,cute kitsch,"a cute film, worth the price of admission but not that much more. It was irritating to see my city shown in such kitschy form. You just cannot walk around these neighbourhoods without seeing a substantial portion of the population as black or arab... many other such minor details that irritate a parisian."
5,A tribute to Paris,"This movie captures the essence that is Paris. Great cinematography and excellent editing, most inportant of all, a story with heart. It is a praise to life; to every samll joys one can enjoy and about never giving up. It makes you want to hop on the next airplane and just fly to Paris. It is common for European movies to stress destiny and fate, still, this is a journey worth taken."
2,Totally overrated French art flick,"This is a movie that will solve anybody's constipation. Except for the traveling gnome, and a few funny moments, this movie is overrated. If you like the director's other films (City of Lost Children, Delicatessen, etc.), then you'll like this. For me, it felt like hours to watch this thing. Yes, it was beautifully photographed, but the story, attempting to be cute and engaging, falls short."
4,Le fabuleux destin d'amelie poulain,"This movie is a pure french film, witty, amusing, and let's not forget the beautiful screens of Montemartre and Le Sacre-Coeur. It's cute, and it has a beautiful bluray transfer. If you're on the fence about getting it, do get it, because it's beautiful."
2,"Good intention, so-so results","This film probably received criticism that was slightly more scathing than it deserved. I am not certain that viewers recognized it for the slapsticky satire that it was meant to be. Nonetheless, I found it gasping for consistency through most of the movie. Unlike the Naked Gun or Airplane, this film often concealed the director's satiric intent. And the satire that did shine through was usually a bit too blunt and obvious, and just plain lacking in humor. Anyone who did not laugh at the scene in which Lovitz and Carrera posed as restaurant waitstaff towards the end of the movie, however, needs to have their funny bone examined! I was in stitches! I would still not necessarily recommend a viewing of this movie for this scene alone."
1,This DVD tell not thing about drink,If you want to see the women with bikini you just look at the cover that all you will see. If you want to learn how to mixed drink this DVD can not help you at all. I should give my money for donation than bought This DVD. I already have 5 DVD about mixed drink that why i can tell you how bad it is.
3,Not a patch on the book,I was disappointed with this version of Robert Goddard's fabulous book. Nothing new there I suppose. Very few books are well adapted for the screen. John Thaw is such an amazing actor but just didn't do it for me as Harry Barnett. If you haven't read the book you'll probably enjoy it more.
1,Why bother?,"Do yourselves a favour and read the book that this Is based on instead. Robert Goddard is an amazing story teller - this was the first of his novels I read, courtesy of my Aunt and I've been totally hooked ever since."
4,Into the Blue,Into the BlueThis was a very exciting mystery to watch. John Thaw had a great performance.
2,Good mystery - trash ... literally,"Others can review the story which I found to be an interesting mystery. However, this book is going in the trash bin because of the few x-rated and totally unnecessary descriptive passages. I guess someone thought the story was not good enough to stand on its own."
3,"Good boot, not great","I used to have a pair of these a few years back and they were great boots lasted me a long time so I saw these and bought them thinking they were the same boot because they had the same name, I was wrong. The material or lack of materials I should say is very apparent. The older version had thicker leather, so it supported my ankles and feet better. They cut a few corners to keep their cost down. When I put on my old pair I still have I could tell the newer version was made cheaper, the laces are already frayed and the bottoms are wearing pretty fast and the leather across the top of the boot is half as thick as the older version. Ok boot, definitely not a work boot."
2,disappointed,"BEWARE this is far from a scholarly biography.This is far from what I had expected. I expected a biography of a brilliantman but got an unapologetic evangelical polemic aimed at an elementary school student level. Monsieur Pascal would be rolling in dismay in his grave. It plays (to say the least) VERY fast and loose with the facts, at least as far as I can ascertain them from other sources. Pascal's famous ""bet"" does not fit well with this born again account of evangelical revelation and certainty. The truth of a terrifying Church/Inquisition demanding supremacy over all including reason peeks through the cracks in the lines here but historical truth is a largely a ""left behind"" casualty."
1,Began leaking after second use,I bought three of these with the high hopes that I wouldn't get faulty ones. I had the foresight to bag them in ziplock bags before use. I was careful to have them lay perfectly flat when I froze them. But one of them started leaking after only the second use. What a waste of $12. Do yourself a favor and listen to the reviews. These items aren't worth the money. I wish I had only bought one to test out.
1,No Refund,"I ordered 2 dozen of these arrows November 2010. They were too short, only 29"" so I contacted the seller and returned them. As of today I am still waiting for a refund. Buyer beware of this seller. They don't even email me back and I have tried to contact them several times.Bummer"
4,"great box, but small!","This case is great. durable, well made, and the foam is great and easy to shape. Only thing is that its much smaller than it looks. Fits my GH2, 14-42 lens, 20mm pancake, 50mm FD, 3 lens adapters, a small intervalometer, charger, extra battery and chords etc. Its about as tightly packed as its gonna get though. Definitely recommend pelican, but definitely recommend going bigger."
4,Love my Combi!,"I've had this stroller for several months and I'm very happy with it. I got it when my second baby was born, and my older child was just under 2. I use it mainly for shopping and walking our dogs, so it gets both mall use and street use.Pros: lightweight; quality fabric; folds easily; built-in ""boot"" for infants (I haven't seen this on any other stroller and boy is it a wonderful thing to have); fits through standard doorways (sure makes shopping a breeze!).Cons: parent cup holder works only with bottles, not cups (it's fabric and hangs from the bar).I'm a little surprised by some of the complaints I've seen here (""too complicated""?) because I feel that I'm a rather demanding consumer, and I've been very satisfied! Also, I bought this stroller because whenever I saw a mom with it and asked her if she liked it, I heard rave reviews. Check it out for yourself before you decide!"
4,Good Read,I chose this book to learn more about Rwanda and it's history. I learned alot in addition to the account of the author's life there. Even though we hear negatives about many places- it was nice to see both sides for a change. I think the more we learn about other countries and their history a better understanding we will have of the people.I plan to do more reading in this area.
2,Too political for me.,"I thought that the book would have been more on herself and HER struggles. The beginning was good and strong but as the book went into detail of the political aspects of Rwanda, I lost interest. Good book for those learning about Rwanda's past, not for the person looking for a ""story""."
1,WARNING- THESE SHOES SCUFF YOUR FLOOR BADLY!!!,"I bought a pair of these shoes because they look really nice and feel decent for casual shoes. However, they have one major drawback- the outsoles are made of obscenely lousy black rubber that disintigrates with every step. STAY OFF OF YOUR FLOORS! THEY LEAVE SCUFF MARKS WITH EVERY STEP!! I went to a house party and the owner noted after looking at his floor that somebody was wearing evil shoes. I was embarrassed and should have known better. In the alternative, Steve Madden makes similar shoes with a gum sole that do not have this problem. I wish I had never gotten these shoes."
3,TAPNSEE,"Heat diffuser good for the price, handel could be a little betterIF NOT PLACED CORRECTLY ON THE STOVE TOPTHE HANDEL GETS HOT"
4,This one's a winner!!,"I got this for my 15 month son. HE REALLY LOVES IT! He doesn't use it as a ride-on yet (more fun will await!), but he pushes the car from the back handle everywhere inside & out. there are alot of buttons which make sounds and some have the car talk back. The ""oil change"" sounds are his fav. HE also enjoys the toy phone(when you put it in the slot it rings and the car answers!) There is also a small storage section under the seat.. The only thing I wish it did have was a horn sound instead of one of the many car's sayings. For the price it is a great interactive toy!! And for a boy who usually is not big on his toys for very long, this still captures his attention months afterward!.oh, and this toy can take a beating! No complaints whatsoever! A great find!"
4,baby's first ride-on toy,"I recently purchased this toy for my 11-month-old grandson's first Christmas. The service was so fast that it was there before I expected it to even be shipped. My grandson was immediately taken with the lights and sounds, and learned really fast to push on the car's ""horn"" to make the lights and sounds work. Then, he would look up and smile and begin to ""dance"" to the music. He also likes to walk behind it and push. My son said that he was a little frightened to sit on the car at first, but that did not last long. So far, it seems to be holding his interest, which is a good thing."
4,Sweet Knife,"After doing a little homework before I made my purchase, I found that Gerber makes a very good knife. This knife is no exception. It not only gets shavable sharp, it can maintain an edge for quite some time before it needs sharpening. This is a great knife for a great price."
2,Not All NATURAL and Contains Preservatives!,"Although this soap does appear to get rave reviews, I have a problem with the fact that it is not ALL vegetable based contains(Tallow)and it contains preservatives(DMDM Hydantoin-which releases formaldehyde into the product!!). Luckily, through my searching I have found WendyLou's Natural Milk Baths and Soaps. They are homemade, with the glycerin still retained and are all natural based with either essential oils or fragrance added. I have very dry skin and her soaps feel so moisturizing and have a great lather, plus its nice to know I am using something chemical free."
3,Good Soap,"I purchased this soap because I had reviews about it and how it helped some people who suffered from Eczema. I tried it for several weeks, but it did not help me. However, this might be a case of ""your mileage may vary"". On the plus-side, the soap was pleasantly fragranced and did leave my skin feeling a little softer than my usual soap."
3,Not as Good as 2007,"Some interesting graphics, but game play is not as good as the 2007 or 2006 versions"
4,What a fun read!,"This book is a lot of fun to read from page one. Kat Jones is a snarky, feisty, funny heroine who will keep you laughing until the end of the book. Great twist on taking a classic tale and making it fresh and new in a chick lit voice. The first person really allowed the reader to know Kat and walk alongside her through her adventure...and oh, what an adventure! This book is a fast-paced, fun read that'll have you cracking up. Kudos to the author for making it an adventurous ride. Definitely pick it up for summer beach reading."
2,Disappointment in Camelot,"This sounded like such a fun book but I became so annoyed with Kat that I couldn't finish it. This is a 29 year employee with La Style magazine who certainly knows her shoes but her language....do 29 year olds still ""like"" every other word? I thought only 14-16 year olds and basketball players still ""like."" Please tell me they grow out of it."
3,A NEW EDITION WOULD BE WELLCOME,Before all I want to say that many topics are given for granted and I find the book not really easy for a beginner. Markets have changed a lot since this book was written and many chapters need revision having in mind that many readers are non native speakers of english and have no idea of many topics given for granted
4,The Bard goes Burlesque?,"In an attempt to satire pretentious theatrical artistes and a culture spoon fed it's vision of ""legitimate art"" by an outdated, archaic intelligentsia, Live Nude Shakespeare is on one level eye candy, and on another, brain food. An eye-opening experience for fans of the Bard, as well as for those who never got beyond the Cliff Notes."
1,horrible products,"i ordered an ak-47 airsoft gun from this seller and within an hour of use, it stopped shooting. i emailed the company and they said they were going to send me a new one and sure enough, they did. i recieved it and started playing with it and a spring fell out. im not sure if it had anything to do with the gun but it did. then, the lever where you can change it from safe, to semi auto, to full auto will not work unless i move it around for a while. then, once i get it to work, it will take about 3-4 shots and i will have to adjust the magazine. if it was possible to give it a negative rating, i would!!!!!!!"
3,ok,i bought this gun because it was cheaper than most of the other ones and i was on a limit.well the gun came with everything everything it said it came with.one thing i don't like about this gun is the stock and i dont like it because you have to unscrew the back of it every time you want to take out the battery.now about the gun its has a real ak47 style look to it i think everything on the gun is plastic and the white part which is the thing you cock back dosent work its just plastic .this gun is ok i would recommend it only for begginers.
1,HORRIBLE GUN DO NOT BUY,"At First When I Bought This Gun I Was Like YES!!!!!!!! merry christmas to me. i shot it outside it fired pretty good for its price, comes w/ goggles a small pack of BB's, strap, etc. i tried semi-auto it fired ok decent accuracy. Then came Day 1, when i buy an airsoft gun i always train with it, get a feel for it, i set up the targets fired i felt an adrenaline rush come through, but as i let my mom see it she thought it was a good gun, so she walks over to me and the end of the gun slightly Taps on the couch and it BREAKS OFF!!!!! i later discover that the BBs wont come out any more, i could open the clip in half with 4 fingers, so if you wanna gun that you will never shoot, or you want it to break in the next 15 MINUTES, i recommend this gun, otherwise, IT SUCKS!!!!!!!"
1,This gun was nothing but trouble from right when we took out of box,First of all when I bought this item it said it was a cm.022 I got a k93 and now the title says ak-47 style airsoft gun. Secondly the battery connector needed to be replaced before the gun was even fired. Finally after getting the gun to fire the plastic gearbox striped after 100 rounds.It is officially broken. Even when I did get to fire all 100 shots it had no power or accuracy.I don't want this to happen to other people. It's a waste of $50 I bought a $30 steyr AUG 300 FPS way better. This gun is JUNK
1,wow cheap plastic and sucks,my barrol broke off on the 2nd war not worth $60 sucks!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! my spring pistol gos faster
2,Do Not Bother,"This gun is hardly worth being called a automatic rifle, it shoots just like a mini auto. This so called assault rifle shoots like a pistol. The entire thing is plastic, and it is not interchangeable with any better brand. This gun with shoot at about 150fps and shoot around 40-60ft. I would only recemend this gun if you are or have a good sniper rifle, just in case someone tries to storm you or come up behind, you can use this AK-47.Pros:1). Light at about 2lbs. Only good for a secondary when sniping.Cons:1). Shoots terrible.2). No range.3). Cheap plastic toy."
2,hop up,For people that dont know what the hop up system is. Well here you go. A hop up system is something in the gun. That will put a back spin on the bb to increase maximum range
3,can' choose,"GUYS I NEED HELP, ok, theres a PARKS MALL at arlington theres a store callled the knife shoppe and they sell airsoft guns there and i have 35 dollars to spend on a airsoft gun .They sell an m16 that goes 260 fps for $25 and they also sell an ak47 that goes 240fps and its fullauto what should i choose or if you think they both break really easily than you might tell me to buy a pistol or something at a different store."
3,OK,Its a pretty good gun. But the reason i gave it a 3 star is because it doesn't come with 2 clips it doesn't come with speed loader and it says on box it does and it takes forever for the battery to charge. I haven't shot it yet because it takes sooooooooooooo long to charge.
4,Awesome,"I was looking for a airsoft gun on amazon when i saw the cheapest ak47 and i knew it was a good gun. The shiping was expensive and the amount of days that it was suppose to take was 3 to 8 days, my order didnt come till 13days. The shooting is awesome and accurate, this was my 1st electric airsoft gun and it is great!"
5,Brand new and works like a charm.,Not too difficult to swap out. Worked perfect right out of the box. Extremely happy.Highly recommend this unit. Replaced the original from 2002.
2,tire pressure gauges didn't work for me...,"I tried these tire gauges, but one or two of them leaked and left me with a low tire. I was not happy. I took them off my new car after a few weeks!"
2,Flimsy,"I've had other on-tire pressure gauges before, and compared with my previouse gauges, these are not particularly sturdy. The clear plastic outer cap comes off rather easily. I have already lost one, and am fairly certain that they would be lost if you were to take them through an automated car wash. The ones I had previously were made of metal and glass and lasted for years. These are plastic and they simply will not last very long."
3,"Decent hat, not exactly like the picture.","The picture shown is different than the hat I received. I'm 100% positive because the hat in the picture has the old NFL logo with 25 stars. Not that I'd want the older logo, but the older model is a lighter tone of blue. The hat I received is a bit darker. Comparing to my other hats, the Bills logo is a little smaller normal.This hat is really comfortable, and with it being flex-fit it fits me perfect.For the price I give it a 3 out of 5, there are better Bills hats out there."
2,Best 2 out of 3?,"Starfleet Command was excellent, truly worth the enter purchase. Academy was nice, a good way to kill a weekend. New Worlds....well, I'll never know because it refuses to run on Windows XP or Vista, no matter the compatibility settings. So, in short, 2 good games and an expensive paperweight. ALMOST a bargain."
5,Innovative Beaded Jewellery Techniques,This book is really unique as far as the beading techniques go. The written instructions looked rather daunting at first but were fairly easy to follow once you get started. Good for advanced beaders to add to their beading repertoire!
3,Not The Platters That I Remember,"The songs included are Only You, Twilight Time, My Prayer, The Great Pretender, Harbor Lights, and Smoke Gets In Your Eyes. I enjoyed the selection of songs, and they were well done. However, don't expect to hear the sounds of the original Platters."
3,"Been there, done that","An interesting and comprehensive review of facts, figures, places and purposes with reference to the war in Viet Nam. Good reference book but not all that suitable for Kindle (too small for maps and such). Presumably accurate and researched, however, the book's handling of Bien Hoa (for instance) pays scant attention to the 101 ABN and its occupation of Bien Hoa (Army) for variousn purposes beginning 1967. Preview of this review shows it was by ""Bozo"" - an Amazon add-in that I don't particularly care for"
4,Very comprehensive,Saved me lots of time searching old documents. Great help setting chronological order of some not so well remembered events.
4,Where We Were In Vietnam,I have had Mike's book for some time now and have found it to be of great use to me. I served in Vietnam as an infantryman in the Australian Army and he has covered many of our battle sites as well as our base areas so for that I say well done.. I currently live and work in Vietnam so I can use it as a constant reference whenever I travel throughout the country visiting the old battlefields and other sites of interest. With all grid references given in the military grid system and the ready availability of military maps for most areas it is a most usefull piece of work.
2,Too hard to read on my kindle,"Wanted to be able to track my whereabouts in Vietnam, and probably would be able to do so in a book rather than on a kindle. Unable to read maps or use indexes to assist in reading."
3,Impressive for a low-budget short,"There are some really good parts to this movie and there are some really bad parts. Starts off pretty slow but about mid-way through, the action starts and does not stop until the end. Pretty good tie-ins to NotLD. Acting was bad plain and simple, however, there were a few redeemable moments. The cinematics were amazing from the angles to the bright bold colors. The zombies were really done well and were pretty good actors. The music/scoring was also exceptionally well done. final note: Loved the ironic ending with the old lady zombie; made me chuckle to myself."
4,Feminist does not equal bad or not scholarly,"Though I have not had the opportunity to review this book, I would like to challenge the negative review it has received. The book description is fair in making the disclaimer that not all readers will appreciate the position it takes. I can say with confidence however that at least one well respected Biblical scholar (a current professor of mine) is a contributor, and I do not think she have agreed being a part of a substandard commentary.Perhaps the feminist view challenged the reader beyond where he was willing to travel."
3,"All kinds of soup. Salads, breads and desserts",I was looking forward to browsing this book but was disappointed. None of the recipes appealed to me enough to want to try one immediately. I'm sure some of them are tasty enough but the format of the book was dull. Perhaps a real soup lover will like this cookbook but I can't recommend it.
2,Too much and too little.,"This book is in some ways a reasonable introduction to MD. It's the only book I know that actually shows the derivatives of energy functions necessary for writing efficient MD code. Unfortunately it does so in a hard to follow way. This is typical of the rest of the text. The example C code is hideous both in format and style. Missing from the book are essential formulae for calculating macroscopic properties from MD simulations. It is probably the best practical guide to writing MD code, but that isn't saying much."
2,good cover...not very good clip and flip on screen protector,"the flip on cover (for the screen), is not very convenient cause it swings without control, and the belt clip is not very secure,my cell phone has fallen a few times.."
2,So-so books for elementary school girls,"These Weather Fairy books by Daisy Meadows (hey... I wouldn't put my real name on them either) are wholly unremarkable. I suppose they're harmless enough for K-3 grade kids, but there's nothing to distinguish them. The writing is tediously simplistic, the stories are unimaginative, and the illustrations uninspiring. I read a couple to my kids and they never asked for them again... and they ask for everything again.This may seem harsh criticism for books so obviously targeted at young girls, but compare these to some of the exception children's literature out there (H. A. Rey, Beatrix Potter, Maurice Sendak, Ludwig Bemelmans, Dr. Seuss, Kay Thompson, Arnold Lobel, etc., etc., etc) and their mediocrity becomes quite clear. Something intended to encourage kids to read doesn't have to aim so low. I'd argue for the advantages of the opposite approach.- mm"
3,Powerful spitting,"The shower head delivers a more powerful spray than my previous one. I plan to leave it in the shower for the time being. I feel some of the spray spits instead of shooting out. Later I may try one of those wide shower heads (10"" or more)."
4,Nice Pressure,"The shower head looks good, it has a plastic knob on the top that looks OK, but it's on top so you don't see it. You better like pressur if you get this shower. I think it is too much pressure for young kids, I don't think they would like it. Very easy to install. I bought it because it is supposed to use upto 70% less water!!."
2,What a snooze fest.,"Light on the gore. Shallow and unlikeable characters. A Boring and entirelyillogical explanation of the title character's purpose. It's a shame toobecause the first film had some shocking gore, top-drawer special effectsand well-defined and likeable characters. Basically, this film loses just about all thatmade the first one good.Rent this movie before buying it."
1,Nothing Latin on this one,Mediocre music that has nothing in common with the Latin sounds/rhythm. There is a reason it sells so cheap - it is a lame collection of boring music.
3,A good story with potential but a disappointing end.,"This would have been a good story if the climax wasn't so dreadful. The characters in this story were refreshing and colorful and the ""gay attitudes"" of the minor characters are right on. Hank Fayette truly depicts the gay country boy in the Navy during WWII New York. His relationship with Juke is typical for the times but you see that he does truly care for Juke. If this was to be made into a movie(an independent movie)Matthew McConaughey would make a terrific Fayette. I hope this novel will become a movie."
3,Its no walk in the park!,Conflict i would have to say is one of the best british punk bands out there. Conclusion is a great album its not just hard punk it gives a little of all kinds of punk and ska (song#7). I think this is a good album for a person to get a good look how conflict really is in the music world
3,Don't Even Trust the Dates,"A previous commentator mentioned that he was unable to trust anything but the dates and locations. I'm afraid he shouldn't even trust the dates. For example, on page 40 the author lists the date of St. Aidan's ordination as Bishop of Lindisfarne as 653 AD, which is difficult since Aidan died in 642. The true date is 635 AD. Also, on the very next page, Bryce lists the date of the Synod of Whitby as 644; in actuality it took place in 664. While this may seem to be an exercise in nit-picking, since the book focuses strongly on the Celtic Christian church, and since these are quite possibly the two most formative dates in that church's history, it is disturbing that the author would offer them incorrectly. Beware of the others..."
1,"Invalid assumptions, poor logic, avoid at all costs","What a disappointment! The author clearly had an agenda, which was focused on the christian influence on Celtic Crosses. Many of his assumptions are self-serving, and I was tempted to put the book down halfway through in disgust. Other reviewers have noted good artwork, which I'll concede, but photos would have been better. I purchased this expecting some enlightenment into what the pre-Christian crosses symbolised, and was sorely disappointed."
2,Something changed,"I have loved Pecan Sandies for many years. Since late 2008, they didn't seem the same - either I changed or they did. My family agreed there was something wrong, we exchanged some at the store, bought a few weeks later from another store... they're different. They used to be kind of buttery soft and 'sandy,' but now they're cruncy hard and the flavor tastes like something was left out. I was hoping it was a bad batch, but now it seems like my favorite cookie is no more."
4,We love our trailer!,"We are completely thrilled with our trailer. It seems very durable and can handle any terrain. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I would like it one star better if it had screened windows on the side. Our 4 yr old tends to get hot (Miami, FL) in the back and sweat. Just wish it was somehow more ventilated. Other than that the trunk is awesome, it is easy to get in and out of, and will be with us for many years!"
4,As a stroller - SO much easier to push my 2 & 4 year,"olds than my old double stroller. I haven't put it on a bike yet, just got it last night, I'm sure it'll be awesome, but I have to say that as a stroller, it stinks that there's no breaks! I mean, there's this strap thing that you put in the spokes, very awkward, fumbly & time-consuming. Especially when you just want the thing to hold still so you can put your kids in. Definitely lost a star for that. I'm trying to think of ways to rig it.But it's just so incredibly easy to push them once they're in! Even over grass and up hills. I can barely believe I'm pushing combined 110 lbs (including stroller). And I love how high the handle bar can be and that I don't kick the back of the stroller while I'm walking. I am very happy and excited about this contraption overall!"
4,Support the music you like,"Hearing these guys on youtube and pirating their music from file sharing is just not putting any money in their pocket. If you like to laugh and you have an off beat sense of humor this music is surely for you. The price is right, buy it. ""binary solo!...000100...."""
5,Great sampling of FOTC wit,"When FOTC's show first came out, I was instantly sold. I ordered this EP and their 'Folk The World Tour' (live album) from SmokeCDs. Both of these albums have their own unique edge. This one (Distant Future) will whet your appetite for FOTC Season 2 (WTF?) and remind you why you enjoy their show so much.While I wish either this or the 'Folk The World Tour' album contained the studio/show tracks (i.e. for songs like BOOM!, Robots, etc.), these are still pretty good--especially for a (mostly) live album. You can also get free mp3s off their site--google 'em and you'll find a few not on either album.With the live show recordings, there's a great freshness to their banter that illustrates just how talented these guys really are (esp. on the fly). Buy this...and don't forget to check out their 'Folk The World Tour' album, too!"
4,Hilarious but Obscure,"This is a compilation of the hilarious stuff that is generated by Bob Roll's grey matter. This guy has knocked his head on one too-many corners, and it shows! These are Bob's diaries and columns looking back on his cycling days (daze?) in the 80s and 90s. As someone who followed the sport in those days, all the references, first names and nicknames were familiar to me. But I have to give this book only 4 stars because if you weren't there in the 80s and 90s, a lot of the references will be lost on you. Luckily, some chapters come with short glossaries to throw you a lifeline. Even if the dropping of obscure names gets frustrating at times, this book is still HILARIOUSLY FUNNY and worth a read. Bob Roll, you are a precious gem...one that is deeply cracked on the inside!"
3,Enjoyable,"The book is entertaining, I'll give it that. I was introduced to the wit and wisdom of Bob Roll through the broadcast of the TDF on OLN. I found him funny and amusing, with some decent insights into the peloton.The book does give me more of his insights, wit and wisdom. My question is...where was the editor during the production and planning of this work? Granted they are diary excerpts and our author's abilities are choppy - but he's a cyclist, not Shakespeare. The chapters of the book jump back and forth between decades at times. Very annoying.I did learn alot about Bob, USA cycling circles, and the strength and determination of Lance. I do recommend the book for some light reading, but dont be expecting to learn volumes about cycling."
2,Had to be there to get it,"I was disappointed with this book. I really enjoy Bob Roll on OLN - his comments and insight are truly funny and I was hoping for much of the same from his new book. The book is just a compilation of his diary and articles. The diary entries from different races are impossible to follow since he uses nicknames for everyone and most entries are short. At the end of some chapters they give a ""Dictionary of Bobke Speak"" to help with interpretation, but it doesn't help much.If you are a pro cyclist I'd buy this book - you'll know the people in it and understand what he's talking about. If you're not, skip it. Too much rambling non-sense."
5,1550 Pelican.They are great cases.,Have used them many times over the years. Very good and almost impossible to damage. Use them for motorcycle cases
5,"Great for mini-cams and accessoreis (gopro, flip, hv30)","Love Pelican cases and have this one case to carry:3 x GoPro's in their cases and mounts along with spare battery/mounts1 x 7"" portable tv as external/larger monitor1 x Flip camera1 x wide angle lens for Flip1 x Panasonic camcorder with spare batteries1 x HV30 with Raynox wide angle lens and GL-2 hood (keep attached to camera) and 3 spare batteries1 x Rode shotgun micThis all fits very nicely in this case and leaves plenty of cushion between everything. I plan on getting another one for my still photography kit.I used various forms of Pelican cases while in the Marine Corps and if you have something you want to protect, these are the cases for you, hands down!"
4,Can a short be one of the best silent films ever?,"You bet. ""Mighty Like a Moose"" is a treasured gem. It would be on my top 10 easily and it runs under 30 minutes. . I understand the reluctance of people to watch silent movies. But trust me I ""forced"" three people to watch it, all of which didn't care for silent movies and they loved it. The main reason for this is the comic genius of the underrated Charley Chase. The plot is about an ugly couple who both get plastic surgery and have to keep it from each other. But how can you hide what's been fixed?Also on this video is ""Hearts and Flowers"", which introduced me to the wonderful Louise Fazenda, another forgotten comedian. The rest of the shorts I didn't care for which explains the 4."
3,Room for Improvement,"I like the authors sketches. But I think there's room for improvement. Some sketches are so rough, it looks like not much thought was put into them. Why even include those in the book? I would like more refined sketches and more volume of sketches."
5,very relaxing,It was exactly what I expected. I love it and use it to help me feel more balanced. The voice is soothing . I use it weekly as a meditation.
2,Not for beginners,"Years ago when I visited Australia, I pick up a Tin whistle and started learning from there, then I ordered this book from amazon wanting to improve, but found out that this book is all about scores and scores for tinwhistle, but nothing to help improve our techniques.Well, to me, it is an ok book."
2,Just changed the year on the cover,"I bought this same book's 2002 edition as we were to travel to Disney then. Something came up & we couldn't go, so we are going this year. I bought the 2004 edition expecting some updates. When I compared them side by side, they were exactly the same, even down to the page numbers the chapters started on. I think to just change the year on the cover is misleading. The info in the book is good but I returned the 2004 edition and will just use the 2002."
5,Packet8 Videophone is years ahead of Vonage and other telecom,"Forget the complaints. The customer service has been excellent for the 2+ years that I've had service. Video and audio quality have been great as well.I carry the phone in a small case when I travel, just plug it into an ethernet port and it self-configures. In 30 seconds or so I'm up and running. I use it to make hundreds of calls (including my ex-wife in Canada) at no extra cost. Packet8 owns the technology and they charge less. Sure they should advertise, but if they did they'd have to charge what Vonage charges.Keep in touch and SEE your family members, old friends...this is a no brainer."
1,Lowest Cost and Service,They are cheap we have them for our business. Their customer service for business customer is the worst. They will keep you on hold while your business phone do not work for 40 and 50 minutes. You get what you pay for. Be prepared even with a T-1 line to have to unplug your phone to get a decent connection. If I could afford better I'd go elsewhere. I use Vonage at home with no issues
5,Great bag!,Got this for my son-in-law who is a biker. He rides to work and need a bag with a sling. This was the perfect match for him and he liked the color also! Thanks
1,backpack review,I gave it as a gift to my brother for his birthday in August. The zipper broke the first time he used it.
2,Bag Doesn't stand up to much,"The Product Shipped quickly and came looking good. Everything seemed that it would work out.. Easily fit a standard sized 3 subject notebook, 2 novels and a Laptop with a 13.3in Screen.. It would also hold a small external drive and a couple decks of trading cards, All with out a hitch it even has slight waterproof capabilities!.. That was about a month ago.. Now, 1 of the Zippers for the main pocket is broken,and The flimsy fabric between the compartments is shredding (And being the type of material it is, It will not mend easily if at all) So Now I have one large pocket.. I'm thinking of repairing it with canvas or another more durable material, but for almost $40.. Shouldn't have to.. One plus is that the exterior material is holding up rather well.. I would expect these problems with a $20 bag... not one at this price.."
2,Not enough substance,"The book is well organized and has some general ideas that are worthwhile, but also have been expressed in most other books of this genre. The generalities are not developed enough to help the reader really lay out a plan for the first 90 days. Each chapter begins with a brief anecdote of someone who either succeeded or failed in a new role. I found myself wishing the author had spent more time on these examples, rather than simply using a couple of paragraphs as an introduction to the chapter.I recommend ""You're in Charge: Now What"" over this book."
5,A guide for managers and leaders in new positions.,"Management books are usually not a major topic of interest for me.Michael Watkins presents a methods for success for new leaders in positions with various issues.The methods involve: promote yourself, accelerate your learning, match strategy to the situation, secure early wins, negotiate success, achieve alignment, build your team, create coalitions, keep your balance, expedite everyone,This book will not teach you how to be a leader but it can help you avoid problems when assuming command of groups or companies. Each chapter presents situations where people made mistakes and shows how they could have been avoided.Overall, I found the book to be useful as I read issues where I could have handled better and learned a few tips to do things better.I do suggest this book for people as it can help the beginner with advice and I think it can help the experienced manager with a few suggestions to consider."
3,Another book that's too long,"I agree with all the reviews that said this book is ""dry"" in tone, as I had a hard time staying interested. From what I got out of it, the book covers a topic known in the corporate world as ""Change Management,"" which is simply managing the inevitable changes that come with any job, project, or major undertaking. They specifically talk about what to expect/do when you have just started a new position with a new company. It's a combination of leadership training, team training, management, and strategic planning.I hope they come out with a ""Cliff's notes"" version of this. This book could be boiled down into about 10 pages of useful info. The rest is just fluff."
3,Ho-Hum,"Like one other one, it isn't bad but the style didn't meet my need. Not bad advice, but nothing that made me change direction or improve my current circumstance. Maybe I didn't look long or hard enough but I did not find it engaging."
4,Great for lateral moves or promotions,This book was helpful to refocus on the new challenges facing you in a new position of leadership.
4,"Taste is really good, ingredients a bit iffy","All the enchilada sauces for Old El Paso are really tasty. Unfortunately they have both soy and gluten, which makes them off limits for a lot of people with food sensitivities (lost stars for that). But taste-wise, for everybody else, they are really good! The red sauce comes in hot, medium, and mild, and unlike some 'hot' sauces it doesn't sacrifice taste at all for the heat. The green sauce is very mild. My kid and friends love enchiladas made with either. I eat lowcarb, and often chop up cooked chicken, dice a little pepper/onion, and mix in a little enchilada sauce (sometimes a little cream cheese) and nuke it and stir. Yum."
4,Valuable Resource,We bought this product for use in a small group setting. We have found it particularly useful in facilitating conversation about walking with God in everyday life. The material is designed for a large group seminar setting. So converting it for use in a small group requires some forethought and planning.The material is good and has helped deepen relationships and offered some solid questions that can lead to greater group intimacy. It does require skilled facilitation.
2,Not for gaming :-(,"Warning to those wishing to play games: disregard the claim that this is an ""entertainment pc"" you cannot run Second Life on it. It has a built in Intel graphics accelerator chip set which cannot handle 3-D graphics. I bought the laptop because it claimed to the one I needed, but I wasted my money."
1,Dangerous!,The closure on the leash is poor. My dog escaped twice before I realized there was a real problem with this leash. The first time I had assumed I didn't get it fully attached to the loop on his collar. The second time he broke free it was a night on a very busy urban street. If he would have wandered off it would have been over! We got back home and my husband and I tested it by attaching the leash to the collar and pulling. The collar repeatedly broke free of the leash with minimal effort. I have not used the leash since and certainly would never buy it again.
1,Wrong clasp for the application,"Years ago I had a saxophone neck strap with that exact kind of clasp on it. After about the third time I caught my 1960 Selmer Mark VI tenor by the thumb hook, I scrapped the strap. The problem with that kind of hook is if you attach it to a small ring, the proximal side of the ring can push on the opening mechanism while giving the distal side leverage to push through the opening."
2,Wish I hadn't purchased this,"Very cheap feeling. Uncomfortable seat, and it took way too long to get the little covers that go over the bolts to stay down. I've already replaced this with a new seat. Only used it for a couple of weeks. Didn't LOOK bad, but if you care at all about quality and comfort, don't buy this."
1,Huge Disappointment!!!,"I bought this book expecting to find out all the juicy details of Beth's life as Lorelei. Instead, all the book describes is a few uninteresting events, most of which we find out later was made up in the mind of the character based on partial similarities to Beth's life. For example, killing the step father and going to New York and all the happenings there. The story line on Guiding Light hints that the diary contains so much more, like a romantic connection to Bill Lewis for example. This book in my opinion is not worth your money. I bought it at the local bookstore and read it in one day, not because it was a good book, but because I wanted to keep reading to get to the good part, which unfortunately never came. I decided it wasn't worth the money and returned it the next day for a full refund."
1,Great until it breaks,"See the other review regarding the drive gear. This machine WILL break, and when it does, you will not be able to get a replacement part. Buy something else."
3,great....for awhile,"I hav the exact same problems as the others. My spout broke after only 6 uses and i have been UNABLE to find replacement. i cannot use the blender anymore because it leaks due to the cracked spout, first the dispenser broke then it cracked. DO NOT BUY!!!!"
2,Good smoothie big mess,I used this smoothie maker about 10 times and every time it was a pain to disassemble and clean. The jar is a very light plastic and the dispensing stem would always cross thread when putting it back together and leaked. If you forget to close the valve after cleaning you end up with a hugh mess to clean up when everything ends up on the counter. After the tenth use my fiance droped the jar and sheared off the valve. We just picked up the cuisinart SmartPower 600 watt blender/food processor I hope this one works better because the jar is glass and I am still wondering if the last breakup was an accident.
2,Pulls from 2 other albums - save your money,Appears to be a compilation from first hot tuna album and Double Dose.The double dose Embryonic journey sounds like it was recorded off a turntable with bad wow and flutter.
3,Fully functional but not full-sized.,"These early handcuffs have a delightfully hand-made look to them. Alas, if you were planning to use these as a prop in a play or for reenacting history, you will be well advised to hire very small actors, children if possible. They are well-made, but are so small you will be hard-pressed to find an adult of normal proportions with wrists small enough to allow the mechanism to close.As a conversation piece I can highly recommend these rustic restraints. If you need props, I suggest you keep looking."
3,If its SILVER... Why is the picture BLACK ?,Has good features. Lazy people should post a proper picture showing true color. Made on a minimum budget. I would have paid a few dollars more for something that seemed better built.
2,Sabrent usb 2.0 hard drive enclosure,First one didn't work. Had to return it and order another one. Return and refund ok. Second one has worked fine. Easy to open and install HD.
4,A good overview of the current state of the art,"This is a very decent collection of individually authored chapters from various groups of educators and engineers working in the field of robotics for teaching and for play. Most of the information presented is anecdotal and case-study, giving what seems to be a good overview of the current state of the art (particularly the state of the art in schools). Some of the reference sections at the end of the chapters point to very good articles that help ground one in the theory of techno-literacy."
3,"Sublime BGM, Spectactular Vocal songs.","This OST focuses alot on ""mysterious/puzzling"" themes which btw is terrible IMO. I get a headache listening to those too much in this OST. It is nothing orignal; too much mix here and there creatively makes this OST sloppy. Though the other themes were okay to listen to. They remind me of Nintendo's handheld rpg games. BUT suprisingly the vocal songs is actually ""Spectactular"". Thats probably the only reason why I got this OST."
4,I didn't expected this!! You can't sit still!! Really Good,"Maybe the songs are a little bit old at the moment (2003). But still, the music is very dancezy and the track are timeless!!If you take place in your seat to enjoy this mix then you will soon feel the need to get up and dance all the room around.This is definitely NOT a waste of money! This is a very good CD with (in my opinion) a funky-housy music style!!! Not to hard but also not to soft!!"
1,Great bang for the buck,"The electronics engineer that installed my home theater reccomended this particular unit because of the features and the value. I went high end on speakers, screen, and projector then thought I could get by for a while with an economical receiver and DVD until they decide on which DVD format will be the new standard. Talk about bang for the buck! Amazon saved me $214.38 compared to the best deal in town.You will love all of the outputs on the Yamaha 5960, the setup was a snap, great remote and easy to use. On the negative side, Electronics Expo offered no tracking for the shipment, just a projected range of dates which ended up being the last day. That caused some acid indigestion. To the credit of EE they did deliver within the stated window, the packaging materials were all authentic and undisturbed. I have no idea how they were able to sell the receiver and deliver it to my door for that price but I am definitely smiling.Cheers,Rick"
3,Worked somewhat...?,"We moved into a house with a severe fly infestation in the backyard. Nearly every type of fly that I can imagine lives in our backyard, making it most unpleasant to be outside, especially because of biting flies. We also have a dog that is our baby, so non-toxic solutions are a must. We bought this bag and used the entire amount on our 15 m x 10 m grass area because we were incredibly desperate. It seemed to knock down the fly population for about a week, but they came back (maybe a little less?). It is hard to tell because our infestation is SO incredibly bad. We are also using this in conjunction with various other non-toxic methods, so I am not sure exactly how useful it was. I do like the fact it was non-toxic and pet/people safe and honestly, sometimes ""non-toxic"" or ""organic"" stuff just doesn't work like the dangerous highly toxic methods, so can't really fault them that. I bet it would work well with people who might have a little fly problem, not the swarms that we have."
1,no goodtimes video for me,"I love this movie, but not the dvd. I buy dvd's for it's original screen format and the extra's this video has neither. Goodtimes video has formatted the movie strait from the vhs version. There is however,a MCA dvd version that is very hard to get. I'm suprised Amazon would carry such a inferrior version as goodtimes supplies."
4,"At last, we got to see the Munster family in color","Entertaing and funny film for any fan of the short-running (two seasons on network TV), but popular comedy series. This shot-in-color film shows everyone the quality and sophistication of the make-up which was not fully revealed in the black and white television series."
2,Save Your Money : Faith gets it horribly wrong,"First of all, to all US Readers, Faith Hill already has a much superior Greatest Hits CD that she released to the rest of the world (can't say why though). That album was called ""There You'll Be : The Best of Faith Hill"" and is actually available on Amazon right now at almost the same price at this CD. I would suggest - do not even waste your time on this mediocre collection - do go out and get that one immediately.This CD has nothing going for it. Lets see - only her pop hits, very few songs, flimsy packaging, no new material, and only half the CD's space has been used. Who would buy this?If you're interested in both quality and value for money, go for ""There You'll Be"" instead. It has all her greatest country AND pop hits, so its a fair collection indeed."
1,Have to agree!,"I have to agree with everyone else. This CD is a complete letdown! I would have also preferred a few more new songs. I think Red Umbrella is a decent song, but I would have liked a few more new ones."
4,Didn't step up to the plate on this one,"Things that bother me about this CD:1) Not enough ""new"" songs.2) The marketing noted that there were 4 songs not included on any other Faith CD. Well, yeh, including the duet from Tim's CD and the live version of ""Stronger."" They shouldn't make it sound like there are 4 new songs.3) The marketing that it includes different versions of some songs....unless I missed something---that is the live version of ""Stronger.""It just seems like there was little to no effort put into this. So, they shouldn't have bothered. Didn't really bring anything new."
3,Key songs missing,"How could they leave ""Take Me As I Am"" off a Faith Hill Hits CD? That alone deserves a demotion in rating."
4,More than just a pretty face.,"Faith Hill - ""The Hits"" is not a complete collection of this country singer's hits but it's still pretty good. Faith has proven she can sing with the best of them, her voice has only gotten better with age. Songs like There You'll Be, This Kiss, Breathe, Stronger, Mississippi Girl, and Wild One are great songs. The new song, Red Umbrella is probably her best song ever! Get this cd today."
1,This is a bootleg,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD!! This is a Bootleg of the 1983 US Festival. There are MUCH better versions available. Google it.
2,Not comfy enough,"I have to update this.. I had opened a box of pads and stored them in my bag and threw the box out... they were NOT Lansinoh pads. I later found the box of Lansinoh under my sink. I do still prefer my First Year pads... but these are a close second.The Lansinoh pads are thin, soft, and absorbent, but I don't remember them ever feeling wet or cold. The First year pads do feel damp at times. But they are still my favorite.The Lansinoh pads are a little more discreat.The First year pads are soothing and more padded.I would give the Lansinoh pads four stars if I could change it. And I'm sorry for the bad review... these pads are very nice. I deleted my former bad review.That said, I do love lansinoh's lanolin! I use it a million times a day! But first Years also makes a spray, which is great if you're too sore to touch when you first start feeding.Anyway, hope this helps!"
5,The best by far!!!!!!!!!,"These nursing pads are the best by far!!!!!!! I've tried every kind of disposable and nondisposable nursing pads, and these are the most absorbent, but yet the thinnest nursing pads! They are also the largest (in a good way!), they hide the best under your clothing(except for when you first put them on-- at that point there is a crease in the middle), and they stay put the best!I no longer buy any other kind but lansinoh! ~I only wish I had known about this one with my first two kids!!!You won't be disappointed :)"
4,Best Nursing Pads,"This was the first brand of nursing pads I tried. My first few weeks of nursing were very painful and these pads were a bit scratchy. Yet after trying several brands of nursing pads, I came back to Lansinoh. They are the most absorbent and discreet disposable pad out there and after I had been nursing for a while they ended up being the most comfortable. The best deal I have found has been amazon's price for 3 boxes."
5,Love them,I never tried any other kind. I've never had a problem with leakage and I've exclusively breastfed my baby who is just turning 6 mo old. Easy to open packages and fit perfectly in bra cups.
2,Not comfortable,"I found this product not very comfortable to wear because of the edge is rough. Playtex pads are a lot more soft, you don't even feel wearing them!"
3,Dino as a Bad-A**,"VHS was in fine condition, still, medocre film from a mediocre script. George Peppard and Dino should have traded roles."
1,stories? I don't think so!,"this book is just ridiculous, each of these, uh, pieces, is nothing but a vignette, or a scene, at most. There is no story, no character, no plot, just some kind portentious preamble then the big kill. and nothing about them is interesting. did I read the whole thing? hell no!! but .... I read at least 10-12 of these so called ""stories"" ...how does something like this get published let alone a slew of enthusiastic reviews from readers? flat out pathetic."
5,Part of my Summer Education,"Despite all of the detractors on the left. The Reagan revolution helped the world overcome the final vestiges of the cold war and began to come together. In spite of this, ALL of his sucessors have neglected to capitalize and continue a realistic and steady march toward the center and a liberalization of thier governments and economies. Countries that are larger more entrenched and there fore a harder sell are now coherent democracies, where those that should have been easy to achieve are quickly coming to the lists of failing or failed states. Bill Clinton did much good to help world peace, however him and his predecessor George and sucessor George Jr seemed to have forgotten the need to develop in the third world, in order to continue keep the world peaceful. Contentment brings peace, education brings peace. This book brought me education. More liberals and conservatives should read this book and then write thier congress people."
1,Not impressed,"Song selections are ok but she seems to be yelling when singing uptempo tunes. Listen carefully and compare with Jane Monheit or Stacey Kent, for example."
4,"Was very good, wish there had been better selection of matches","I really enjoyed the interviews on disc one. Honestly, that is what carried the whole set. I was disappointed that the selection of matches they selected. I mean, with all the legendary matches they had with superstars, they had the nerve to show Tully, Arn, and Ric, vs. Rocky King, Pez Whatley, and the Italian Stallion! People did not buy this set for those type of matches, I certainly did not. And the War Games from 1988?! The 1987 was the original and THE best! They left out how J.J. Dillon throwed champaign in Sting's face, the feuds with Ronnie and Jimmy Garvin (They showed that date with Precious) Dusty Rhodes beating the crap out of Tully Blanchard with a bat, and Tully and Arn's brief feud with the Midnight Express. again, very good, but the match selection could have been a whole lot better. If this was a Crockett/Turner owned DVD, I am sure we would have gotten the Total Package (no pun intended)"
4,"Good, not great, product.","Fairly easy to install and seems relatively strong and sturdy. As previous reviewer stated, the hole in the support arm is larger than the head of the nail supplied. I used an appropriate washer and it worked great. Overall, the product worked well and costs minimal. Good product, but not great. Great would likely cost much more."
3,Is it a toy or a fan?,"If you want a fan don't buy it. If you want a toy, then buy it. It is not a fan at all- more like a noise maker..."
4,Very good intro to the continents,My daughter (almost 5) these books as an introduction to Geography (recommended in the Core Knowledge books). We've both learned a lot!
4,Works as described.,"Reviews suggest issues if you don't have this when installing Culligan, so I ordered one of these. I can't say that it's better than using ad hoc fittings but I installed today and it fit smoothly, tightly and no leaks what-so-ever. If you're a DIY-er (not a professional), all I can tell you is - it was obvious, easy to install, and it works!"
1,A real feat!,"Strom is an inherently interesting personality and the authors have managed to reduce him to a BORING cardboard character. This should have been a facinating story of both the man and the country over the last 5 decades. It was not! I would not have belived it was possible to mess up such a great tale, but the authors have. I looked forward to reading this and was really disappointed."
4,good if your feet are normal,"Service from Bealls was excellent. The sandals are very well made. I have very wide feet. To try to compensate for that I ordered a size larger than what I usually get. The sole is large enough and quite comfortable. The straps, however, are uncomfortably tight. They are leather, and appear to be decent quality leather, so they will probably stretch over time. For now they are moderately uncomfortable to wear."
1,No response,"Although the order arrived quickly, The sizing was off. It ended up being a size too small. Upon contacting Amazon they said they would have the seller contact me. I wanted an exchange. I still have heard nothing almost two months later. Would not buy again."
5,"Great flipflops, love it~~",I already owned this and the thong is solid and stands for years. It is very comfortable with cushioned sole. The bottom rubber has good grips and last long~~~. Columbia uses good material. Bought one pair for my son and he liked alot. Ordered two more pairs in Darkbrown and Flax.
3,"Nice, but not the best!","This book is a well written book with nice pictures and so. You could buy it, but I would rather buy Leonard Lee's book. After reading Mr Lee's book, you won't need this one."
2,Lord Jim recycled by an author in decline.,"Apocalypse Now seems to have shown up too often on the BBC,and Le Carre has decided that in his old age, the memoryand plot of his first book needs to appear once again. Itsthe old story of Lawrence and a hundred other Englishmenwho for some reason or another ""go native"". There's allthe adventure of any old copy of ""Chum"" or ""Boy's Own"" inthe covers, with an added soupcon of a nubile young womancheating on an old age pensioner who is her lover. Oh no!A vapid tour through the antique shops of Bath, a few oldwarstories - the dashed Hun are Chechins here! - and theW.C. Fields of Russia - Boris Yeltsin -is charging in withhis dastardly Cossacks! And what an ending...if you can findit!! Le Carre writes: ""I was an idiot. I took a holidayfrom who I was"". Right mate...the book is proof!Rumours are that George Lazenby has been signed to play thelead in the film of this title.C.K. Dexter Haven"
1,Snore,One of Le Carre's more convoluted plot lines. A real struggle to keep people straight and time lines. I think this is the last Le Carre book I'll listen to.
4,An Intellectual Explorer,"The subject matter of this smoothly written book is what happens to a double agent after the demise of the Soviet Union and its satellites. At Russia's edges the world is sufficiently tumultuous to engage the emotions and the intellect of such a figure, one of the main characters of Le Carre's novel, Lawrence Pettifer.The man turns up missing. He fails to show up for the opening lecture in the new semester at the university which employs him, Bath.It seems that both Larry and Tim Cranmer, his British supervisor, have been made redundant. Nevertheless, Tim Cranmer is questioned by both the police and his own former agency to ascertain Larry's whereabouts.The interest of the story is the interior monologue of the Cranmer character, building the backstory, undertaking travel in pursuit of both Larry and the truth. This is one of the stronger novels of Le Carre. The tone and the twisted nature of the plot are just about perfect."
1,Militant Anti-Mobility Screed,"Autos have offered the freedom of mobility for millions who could never have otherwise left their places of birth in pursuit of a better life. Go to any developing country, and ask people what they want most. The answer: automobiles. Because automobiles represent freedom, mobility, a better life and more opportunities to pursue their dreams. Why Motavalli is opposed to this is beyond comprehension. He is a self-appointed armchair social engineer of the worst stripe; a hectoring scold who probably wishes there was an armed batallion of lifestyle police ready to confiscate the family minivan if they got the chance. Don't waste yout time or money on this tripe, unless, of course, you're a member of the Earth Liberation Front looking for an impetus for your next anti-social act."
5,2-year old loves it,"My 2-year old daughter adores this pony and the video she comes with. When she watches the movie, she smiles the whole time. It teaches about friendship, and is very calming."
1,not a good choice at all,not well written or well detailed. Try Graphic Guide to Framing for a much better refrence.
1,Shame on You,"Come on, Amazon. Keeping this book on your site is no better than McCreary watching a kid getting sodomized, and then walking away, ostensibly to take a day to think about how best to deal with the situation. How long is Amazon going to think about whether or not to list this horrifyingly titled ""Touched"" book? Shame on you. McCreary should have beaten the crap out of that pedophile and taken that poor kid to the police station to report a crime. That's what a normal person would have done. Amazon should have immediately removed this book from its site. That would have been the decent executive decision. Wow. No wonder things like this happen. No one has the balls to do the right thing. Cowards, all of you. Remove this title completely from your site."
1,"I am truly ""touched.""","I just got back from a three-week fishing trip in the boundary waters of Minnesota, and this book was my sole entertainment in the ""land of no cell signal"". Jerry Sandusky is a class act and the reason why I'm the biggest Nittany Lions fan EVER. I'm on the ferry now and just got enough signal to write this message on my Ipad. Wait..gimme a second. My phone is blowing up with texts from last week from a bunch of Ohio State fans I work with......"
1,An outlandish Lie,"Based on the recent allegations against Jerry Sandusky, it appears that this book is in fact, a carefully crafted lie designed to present Coach Sandusky in a positive light. It should be sold as fiction because recent events have cast a shadow of doubt on everything presented in this book. And I agree with the other reviewer, the title of this book is offensive in light of the charges filed. Everyone who continues to buy this book is helping to pay for Sandusky's criminal defense. If Sandusky is convicted, Amazon should stop this book immediately."
1,the profits of this bookshould go to the victims,I hope Jerry Sandusky rots in hell. Amazon should forward any and all profits to the victims. Joe Paterno should be arrested and be brought up on charges.
1,The irony is disturbing,[..] The victims are being forgotten in all this. I can't imagine how they felt to wake to see students protesting IN FAVOR of Paterno!
1,Disgusting Manipulator!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Sandusky is a creep lowlife!!!!!!!!!!!! Take his book off your site!!!!!!!!!!!!Replace it with a new book. ""How to protect our youth from creeps like Sandusky""!!!!!!!!!!!! What has happened to the moral values of this country(((((("
5,Oh Dear God...,"...why did I not buy fifty copies of this book a year ago? Now, who knows if I will ever be able to obtain even one copy, at least lawfully. The sample pages fill me with longing to read the whole thing. I would put this book right up there with Bridges of Madison County, a book I read in one four-hour couldn't-put-it-down sitting, my mouth literally hanging open with a twisted leer of horrified delight the whole way through.Please tell me this book is available on Kindle.I sincerely hope this review helps people."
1,What the heck is with this guy?,"I still don't understand why Sandusky would do such a thing. Wait, this is supposed to be a review of the book, not a review of Sandusky. The book makes me cringe."
2,Great X_mas Gift,Just in time for the holidays. Ordered the Leather bound edition and got a ball gag for free. Thanks Jerry!
1,Books by Kooks,There is no reason for this book to cost so much money. Are these Sellers capitalizing on the scandal? Or does the book come with a lifetime supply of Play-Doh?
1,"Well written, but not as informative as I would like.","I originally purchased this book to learn about Jerry's ability to ""touch"" the lives of others through the Second Mile charity. What I discovered was not at all as I expected. The accomplishments of a career are wiped out by sexual perversion and corruption, and this is one of the tragic cases."
2,A Touching Story,"Thrilling, blow-by-blow account of Sandusky's journey from Penn State to State pen. Shows his true mastery of the use of both consenants and bowels. Fast-paced action leaves the reader unsure if Jerry is coming or going. Sure to be a classic!"
1,Prophetic,"Prophetic. An instant classic of unfathomnable depths. Tightly packed with behind the scenes moments of intimate collision. A shear monument to literature detailing the powerful, forceful thrusting forward it takes to grab that true goal. This book details all the lost fondles, caressing maneuvers and come from behind cleverness that it takes to reach around the jaws of defeat and come into the annals of greatness."
1,"Send him to the ""State Pen"" after a speedy trial","Joe Paterno's version of ""Don't ask Don't tell"" abused 10 year olds. Time to jail him - let him see how the showers at the ""State Pen"" work."
1,"Terrible book, Terrible person","This book's title alone is disgusting given this creep's past. Do not buy this, it will only help him pay his legal bills."
1,Awful Book Full of Lies,This book is absolutely awful. The only thing worst than this book is Jerry Sandusky himself. He should be ashamed.
4,Good matches...,I just bought this dvd. I bought it mainly for the Steamboat & Youngblood match at Starrcade like another person has stated. I think The Youngblood/Romero family could've been included in this dvd also. It's descent not the best but it could've been worse. I bought my copy at FYE for $16.99 a bargain compared to other stores selling it. I would reccommend it for the few unseen matches that are featured are worth purchasing this dvd.
3,review,the item is'nt protective from cold and i was also not completely satisfied with the fitting and appearance
4,Good deal,"I wear it to work and my only complaint is that, while it looks better than its price tag suggest it will, nobody is going to be fooled into thinking you spent a lot of money. Warm and ok as an everyday coat, but not formal-wear really."
1,Doesn't work,"Put simply, this toy doesn't work. Or I should say perhaps it would work with really good bubble solution but it does not work with the bubble solution that comes with it. It sort of sputtered some bubble solution out the top but we never got even one full bubble much less the stream of bubbles we were hoping for. Luckily my little son never saw the toy and therefore didn't mind when we took it back."
2,Bubbles do not work,I am unhappy with this toy as often the bubbles do not work. You push the handle and nothing comes out. There are directions to empty it and try new solution. I am unhappy with this purchase.
1,Do not buy this.,"This bubble blower just plain doesn't work. Even when you hold down the handle, the bubbles don't come. When finally after three or four tries, the bubbles do come out, only 4 or 5 bubbles come out. You do better with a simple wand.I went through lots of bubble fluid filling it up and trying it different ways, tilting it, etc. and have given up."
3,Clue,it was not predictable. It was strange. It was odd. It was kinda crazy. Only my wife saw this movie.
4,Wonderful!!!,"As a young adult, we often enjoyed playing CLUE. When we recieved the movie as a gift years ago, we watched it often. So after several years we bought the newer Clue game and decided we had to have the movie too!!! We watched it again and it is just as fun as years ago !"
4,Funnier each time I see it,"I bought Clue for under $10 and I have to say I can't remember the last time something gave me this much fun for so little money! If you haven't seen the movie yet, it's a must, just so much fun! And the DVD has all the original endings!"
4,Always a classic,"I was Very happy with the Blu-Ray, no matter how many times I watch this film it never fails to deliver. Very well done and they picked the perfect actors to play the roles. It was nice seeing it in crisp HD, it for sure cleaned up very well."
2,Why so many positive reviews for this movie?,"Great cast. One would expect great laughs. Big snoozer of a movie, however. Really, it's not worth your time watching this one."
5,A Masterful Classic Romp,"Clue as it's movie form is a lot of fun, with the jokes and sarcasm sliding around with ease. It doesn't take itself too seriously at any given point, and the multiple endings are fantastic."
1,the worst movie ever.,"there's no word to qualify a movie like that..if you want to laugh *about* a movie, *rent* it..oki.. that's all"
5,Comedy + Mystery = Brilliant!,"This is one of the funniest movies of all time. It combines the genres of comedy and mystery into a hilariously entertaining whole. The dialogue is fast, clever, and chock full of subtle humor. There is plenty of physical comedy too. The story line is well written and the alternate endings are wonderful. All the endings are possible, I went back and saw who was where and it worked! The actors are all brilliant and they can say so much with just a look. Tim Curry as the butler was simply a pleasure to watch! This is one movie that didn't get the attention it deserved. Perfect to watch anytime!"
1,buyer,"I opened the box and played some music and found out the bass speaker rumbling, sound like broken. I lowered the volume of the bass speaker and the use the two small speaker. I am very dissapointed wasted my money. This is a no no brainer in my part. I will not do it again. I just buy something in Wal-Mart get better deal."
2,Do the recipes work?,"Photography is gorgeous, however, do the recipes work? I've tried the ""Bouchons"" (chocolate corks), a simple recipe: they were worse than mediocre and looked nothing like the photo (I am an experienced baker, BTW). At least they were edible. Which recipes have the other reviewers tried and had succes with? I would like to try more of the other recipes, however, do not want to waste my time...it is interesting that several reviewers admit to having not even tried the recipes and one reviewer pans three of them!"
2,Don't get it for Optometry,"This book is way too much. We were required to get it for Disease class and I regret it! This book has entirely too much information and goes into too much detail. It's very hard to carry around anywhere or even to use in the office. They should have put it in 2 volumes and had it divided into surgery and disease processes or something. Bottom line, too much information for most people."
3,Needs better mounting system,"I feel that anchoring with screws into the sheet metal of the roof is not secure enough. An expanding anchor would be much more secure and be almost impossible to rip out of the roof. I sincerely hope the rack doesn't come off with my new Thule Ski box on it.As soon as possible I will install expanding anchors and 3/16"" bolts in place of the screws supplied with the rack. Other than my concerns with the mounting hardware I feel the rack has a nice appearance and looks good on my Mazda 3."
4,great price - quality pretty much as described- speedy service,"Nice to find this book. I was pleased with how quickly it got to me. I don't remember reading that it was a library discard - which might have made a difference in the wear, though not my purchase of the book. Nice folks to deal with."
3,Tampered excitement,"My excitement for this overall great bike has been tampered by the fact that it leans to one side. Many people stop me saying it looks unsafe... at the bike shop they threw up their hands saying: oh, well you bought it on Amazon! What can I say..."
1,Wobbly,"As others have mentioned already, I found this thing to be very, very ""wobbly"".I never, ever felt comfortable riding with my (almost 4-year-old) son on this thing. It just felt too unstable.I returned this after only a few days."
4,Great collection of obscure '50s R&R Covers!,"Many thanks to the folks at Ace for rounding up these difficult-to-find '50 rock 'n' roll covers. These were issued on the highly collectible Bell label with wonderful, tacky picture sleeves (reproduced in the beautiful accompanying booklet, with extensive notes). Of note to R&B fans will be several vocals by the very talented and terribly overlooked Edna McGriff. A first-class job all around."
3,Not a good product,"The only thing I like about this product is the size. It's compact and lightweight. When I use the bluetooth I could usually hear the person on the other end but there is usually a lot of static. The person on the other end cannot usually hear me. They say all they hear is a lot of static and it sounds like I am far away. When I disconnect the bluetooth, the person on the other end could hear me clearly. This is my first bluetooth purchase, and I would not recommend it."
1,Non-Skid Hospital Socks,These socks are crap. One wear and they get holes in them. I do not recommend anyone buying them - I wish I hadn't!
4,gret gift,I gave this book as a gifrt to a friend who had her first grand baby She loved it immensly
3,Why I wasn't happy,"First time user. Granddaughter is in Virginia, I'm in Michigan. I was late getting it to her. She gets it on Wednesday. I'm calling to see if she liked it. Very good shipping I might add. But she hasn't cooked anything in two days because she needs a lightbulb?!?! I did buy the batteries for an extra charge. I would have loved to have bought the lightbulb too. I knew her mother was going to be slow in getting her anything extra so I was hopping she'd be able to pop it open and work it herself. She's a very smart 10 year old. So that's why I wasn't happy and was looking to write the company and suggest either putting it in the box or selling it."
3,As Expected,"It was what I expected, interviews with soldiers giving their pov. Read the description, will tell you everything you need to know."
3,Nice book for the curious,"This book is more focused on what Tolkien might have been reading at the time and ""might"" have sparked the imagination for his stories on than anything else. He once said that he wanted to create a kind of modern mythology for his time. So this collection is a nice primer if you want to know about earlier stories we don't hear too much about today. Researching and finding all these in the library would be tedious. And it's nice if you are a writer or a fan who wants to know where many of our modern stories came from.If you are strictly a Lord of the Rings fan, though and want to know specifically where Tolkien pulled much of his inspiration from, including the ring myth, I would highly recommend ""Tolkien's Ring"" by David Day and Allan Lee. It is packed full of the ancient mythology, names, etc. he most likely used."
3,Made in 1985,"My students had read the book so I purchased the film. It is ""R"" rated because there is a LOT of swearing...but it goes with the story. The acting in the fight scenes is really phony, which got the kids laughing. Also, it changes a lot of the book...but we were all glad to see it as it still pretty much followed the book."
4,Scheewe does a great job with palette knife.,"While using the palette knife, Scheewe brings nature to life with vibrant, true to life colors. Great lessons on painting wothapleeete knife."
4,Good book but with not enough examples,"I think this book is a good book. It's all about spring and related tools which can make easier developing softwares. The author makes it easy to learn but the examples were not enough. There isn't a system which we can refer later back. Other books I've read come with examples which we can consult and remember because they were used in a real application. It is a drawback for most java developers who don't have experience in Spring. Nevertheless, if you are new in topics such as Dependency Injection and Aspects Oriented Programming, this is a book for you. However, if you are not used to using EJB, JMX, Web MVC Frameworks, you should read other books before you get it.To sum it up I would say that this book is for experienced Java developers who want to use spring. They can take all of concepts in this book."
3,shallow,All the chapters just touch on the subject and there is absolutely no detailed discussion. Don't waste your money and just read the spring online docs.
3,"Good topics, just not enough content",I like this book in that it goes over a lot of the topics that one should know about in Spring but I feel that there just wasn't enough details within each of those presented topics. I would have liked more in depth description of how to use each topic and when to use it.
4,Excellent book on Spring,"This book is very excellent! It covers a lot of aspects of Spring and any programmers with decent java skills can learn a lot. I especially like the humorous approach on the knights and Spring Idol. These are great examples to illustrate Spring to the readers. I wish the author covers more on Hibernate, which the author points to ""Hibernate in Action"""
5,Brilliant book!,Perfect book for beginners in Spring. Had never used Spring before and was quickly able to pick up even advanced concepts. Very easy to read and follow. Highly recommended to anyone wanting to learn Spring or refresh their knowledge of the Spring Framework.
2,Sloppy by and large,"Some chapters (the basic Spring) are ok (even good.) Many advanced topics are covered in a sloppy manner. Further the editing is generally bad. I must say that I have read a finely edited book by Manning, namely Hibernate In Action."
1,NOT HELPFUL AT ALL FOR THOSE WHO WANTS TO LEARN SPRING,"This book is so hard to understand for those who don't know Spring and want to learn how to build a small, simple application using Spring. For those who already built an application using Spring, what is written on this book probably make sense.There are no examples of how to build a small web app using Spring.The code snippets are portion by portion only and seems disconnected, instead of using a simple, real business logic example, it is using terminologies that are so hard to understand.This book is not for beginner Spring."
3,"Good Content, But Editor Should Be Fired","This book did exactly what I wanted it to do: gave me a good understanding of the nuts and bolts of development using the Spring Framework. It gave me an appreciation for the capabilities of the framework, and enough knowledge that I can comfortably create a Spring-based application.As many other reviewers have mentioned, this book is riddled with errors. I am comfortable enough with my Java knowledge that I was able to read over a mistake and think ""hey, that's not right."" If I were less experienced, I imagine the errors would really make things confusing, and I would probably be less forgiving.If you consider yourself to have a solid understanding of Java, and are willing to accept the imperfections of the proofreaders and editors, then go ahead and read this book; it will still give you a good understanding of the Spring Framework."
4,Version mixup or trick???,"Spring in action 2.0 was released on the 16th of August 2007. These comments hitherto are not for version 2.0. The ""in action"" series of manning are however excellent. Looking at the comments and ratings of the previous version(s) of this book it is worthwhile going for this edition especially if the authors of this edition are the same ones who wrote the previous edition(s).I have not yet got this book but I intend getting this book myself as soon as I can steal some time from the project on which Im working."
5,A Natural Born Storyteller,"This is the first of two volumes collecting the stories of Brigadier Ffellowes a ""Club"" member who regales/offends other members of the Gentlemans Club with stories of daring do and eerie adventure. Lanier is clearly inspired by Dunsany and Laniers stories stand beside the lords Jorkens stories as grand entertainment. If you want great story telling in the tradition of Dunsany, Lanier is your man. This book should really be re-issued in paperback or electronic format, Lanier deserves a wider audience."
2,Russian Dance group,"The dancing in this video was of a high standard but the film quality was very poor, which was so disappointing. The colours were so washed out that all reds were pink and everything had a sepia tinge. Also the film quality made everything look ghostly and insubstantial so it was virtually unwatchable. If the quality of this video had been acceptable, what I could actually see of it would have been well worth watching. I will not bother to watch it again as you strain your eyes trying to make things out. A surprise at the end after the credits had rolled was what looked like a rehearsal for an Irish dance set, performed by the dancers in practice gear. All in all, a very disappointing buy but at least it was so cheap I couldn't complain about the price."
4,Sister of the Bride,Sister of the Bride was a very nice book. It was very realistic as all of her books are. I liked reading it because it was written such a long time ago and some of the pharases where kind of old and that mad it fun to read. I also liked it because of the non stop adventure. BUY THIS BOOK!
2,itchy and scratchy,"This is probably the most uncomfortable bra I have ever purchased. I would say that, because of the price, ""you get what you pay for,"" but that really is not true. I bought a Vanity Fair bra at Target recently for $8.00, and it's very comfortable. It is true that this one shapes nicely, but at complete sacrifice to comfort."
3,"Useful, but not integrated","A useful tome, this book has sections in it written by different people, but all from the Master's Seminary (The College associated with Grace Community Church - Macaruther's church). As a result, I think it is a little too slanted in one direction - and does not even examine the importance of preaching the Old Testament from a coventantal perspective (Macarthur and Masters are Dispensationalists).Macarthur's sections are probably the most illuminating, but the technical details apply only to those with an understanding of Greek and Hebrew and are therefore only aimed at preachers with a seminary background (as opposed to lay preachers).One quibble - Macarthur argues that sermons less than 40 minutes in length are questionable. While I don't like 10 minute homilies, I do believe that 20-35 minute sermons are a good balance of detail and brevity."
3,oxo dust pan set is so fabulous but it's larger sibling...,"I bought an oxo dust pan set that worked very well.It collected all the material that needed to be picked up. So when I saw there was a larger version, I jumped to buy it. Sorry to say it doesn't hold a candle to the small dust pan set. There seems to be a ""magnetic"" something, something to the dust pan broom, but not the long handled set. The upright set is not worth the money they are asking. So Sorry."
3,Very small!!,"This broom is so small! It is pretty good for quick clean up jobs but is sort of annoying to use for a complete sweep of a kitchen or bathroom. I am only 5'4"" and I have to bend over to use this little thing!"
4,Great for small jobs,"I clean the area around my cat's litter box everyday. This is perfect for my use. Love that I don't have to bend over to scoop everything up now. The brush is not up to par for what I'd expect from Oxo, but it works."
1,First return ever to Amazon,"If you're looking for a whisk broom with a longer handle or have just a small area, then this would be great. The product seems fine. I, however, was looking for a full sized broom.I already have this packed up to go back, so I can't take my tape measure to it, but the 9.3 inches width (in the description) must be the width of the dust pan. You can kinda extrapolate how wide the broom is since it fits inside the dust pan. And, as several people have mentioned, the handle is way too short for anything but a quick spot job.The reason for my one star is really to address Amazon's description rather than the product. I think if they made it a little clearer then all the ratings might be good."
2,"Not typical ""Good Grips"" quality","I am a big fan of Oxo's Good Grips product line, and have been known to purchase items I have no actual need for, figuring if I ever do have a need, I want the best.This particular item, however, truly disappoints. The plastic tray is very flimsy. The hinging mechanism on the tray is not very good--I think it is intended to allow the tray to lock in either an open or closed position, but does neither very well. The center of gravity of the handles is such that it tends to tip over unless balanced perfectly or left leaning against a wall.I plan to keep my eyes open for a reasonably-priced commercial version to replace this as soon as possible."
1,Too short for even a short person,"Not worth it - I'm just over 5 ft tall and this broom is too short for me. Does a decent job of catching debris - but too hard on the back and hands because of the way you have to hold it to get leverage. Upside - good for spaces like behind the couch, on the side of the refrigerator, etc. I would not buy this again and now the search continues on."
3,Small And Gets The Job Done,"Perfect for those with space and/or storage challenges. It's small size means it stores easily, either hung on the wall or sitting in the corner. The dust pan, when folded open, has good balance, standing upright without having to brace it or continually hold on to it while sweeping. It holds a lot of swept up debris, and the brush seems to be able to get into tight spots, and picks-up well. It is well made and doesn't feel flimsy.With that said, it is really, really short. At only 5' tall and wearing socks (no shoes with heals), this broom is still too short for me. It actually hurts my back as I have to either lean over or otherwise bend my knees a bit in order to sweep with this broom. For small messes, or small areas to be swept, I can see how this would be tolerable, but I would not recommend it for whole house sweeping, not even a large room. As it is I purchased it for the porch, not a huge space and not needing swept that often, so it's fine."
2,Did not expect a child's broom,I should have read the reviews. I ordered the broom set expecting a full size broom and dustpan. This should be labeled as a child's broom and dustpan set. I am keeping it since I got a break on shipping for the rest of my order but it is useless.
3,Works GREAT but way too short. However - it does have its uses,"My review title pretty much covers it all: works great but way too short. However, if you have storage issues, or want a broom to keep specifically for one area (such as a kitty litter bathroom), this might be the perfect choice.I did love the broom quality & am going back to find a taller OXO."
1,I wish you could give no stars!,This filter is nothing what it says in the description. If you are buying for a Eureka Maxima upright vacuum THIS IS NOT YOUR FILTER EVEN THOUGH IT SAYS IT WILL FIT!
1,I've suffered long enough,"I made it to page 120 (not sure how), but I can't take any more. I'm throwing it out! Horrible. Both the characters and dialogue are ridiculous."
2,Bram Bogart,"This is a catalogue from an exhibition, but the problem for the English-speaking art lover at present is that there are very few studies on Bram Bogart available (the best are in Dutch & French). Bram Bogart, now in his 80s, has specialized in works of art created from materials, giving them a 3-dimensional structure. Most of them are certainly not the sort of works you can take home from the gallery - the heaviest weigh in at about a ton!- but the combination of colour & structure are unique - & it's good to see that recently he is finding a considerable following outside Belgium, France & the Netherlands. This catelogue looks at his more portable works - paintings & gouaches - but still shows that great talent he has for colour & composition."
3,German Book,This is a very interesting book. I would reccomend it to anyone who is interested in learning German.
2,great interaction/wrong edition,"I purchased this book for a German class I am currently attending. The teacher sent the title, author, and edition months in advance, and I was one of the only students with a book on the first day of class. I was then that I discovered that the book I was sent was not the book I needed: this edition was incorrect despite the fact that it had been advertised differently. I now have to shell out another fifty bucks to get the correct edition. While the product was shipped to me in a very timely fashion and I had no problems whatsoever during the purchasing process, they need to be more accurate in their product descriptions."
5,They care,"THE GIRL WATCHERS CLUB could be a documentary but the skill of the writing makes it read like a novel. The men of the group care about each other; they care about their families; they care about their country; Harry Stein grows to care about them himself, regardless of how his generation felt about ""people over thirty"" in the 1960s. The book not only rings nostalgic bells for readers who shared those years, but it is extremely important that young people read it in order to understand what their families experienced in the years of depression and war, and to be reminded to express appreciation of their parents while there is still time to do so. There are many lessons to be learned from reading the book. It will end all too quickly because the reader has come to care for its cast of characters."
2,The cast had their moments,"What happened? Tony had the lights, cameras, casting action.. After the 1st 12mins the script fell off into the crapper... The cast had recognizable faces who were never challenged to pull this movie off.."
1,Total waste of money!!!,"I am fascinated with the raw foods diet, and I prepare quite a few raw foods. I have made raw brownies, lasagna, pie, cake, etc. I also eat raw garbanzo beans, veggies, and oat groats. I also take importance in strength-training, so this product seemed interesting. Boy, did I waste my money. It costs nearly $30 for only 16 oz, which is barely a quart. Also, each serving has only 11 grams of protein. Most supplements give you more protein for less money. Even though whey protein isn't the best thing for your heart, soy protein powders are also much cheaper and deliver more protein per serving. If you really want to go raw on the protein, eating raw garbanzo beans is a much better way to go. Garbanzo beans are inexpensive and have more protein per serving than this supplement. Plus, they are loaded with B vitamins, fiber, and other nutrients."
2,Eccentric to a fault,"Quite an odd performance, this is. I have admired Christine Schäfer's work with Harnoncourt, so this was a dissappointment. Sopranos certainly have their work cut out for them attempting this, and unfortunately she does not rise to the challenge. In fact, it is hurried, and ill-phrased. The piano is ponderous. For a performance by a female, you are best served by Fassbinder."
1,Junk,"Bought this to hot cut plastic wire wrap - after 20 minutes, the knife was barely warm - the barrel was hot, but there was little to no heat transfer to the knife blade. Don't buy this piece of junk."
1,Nightmare Month,"So for weeks I suddenly started having issues with my cat and the litter box. It would be soggy, it would stick to bottom of the pan, would stick on the scooper and worst of all it would stick on my cat's rear paws. He would drag litter into the bed and eat/pull of the debris between his toes. I finally took a closer look at my litter pal and it said Scoop Away not my usual Fresh Step. But how could one sand litter be that bad compared to another? Well I went out and bought Fresh Step the next day and immediately the strong smell was gone, the soggy wet litter was gone. When my cat urinated it form a solid strong round chuck that didnt stick. Most important his digestive track isnt messed up as there is no litter to clean off his paws."
4,still reading,"I'm still reading this book. I like that he gives a lot of real-life examples of what happened to other people. I don't know that I've learned anything new, yet."
5,Must read for Christian Business owners!,"We liked this book so much, we bought it for my father-in-law who just started his business. If you have a burden to approach your business with Christ at the center, read this book!"
3,Not CX greatest BUT,"Not CX greatest BUT still interesting especially the CX rendition of Borghesia's N.U.D. (Goli, Uniformirani, Mrtvi.) Some of the posters have likened CX to Sisters of Mercy, which I find VERY funny... they aren't about the same thing. Anyone that has listened to the album Theomania can surely vouch for that. WetWare doesn't come close to Theomania BUT ""Bad Faith"" is rockin and ""Twice as Good"" has very valid points and is ""catchy""."
1,Who was the editor for this book? Was there one?,I just bought this book and have not tried any of the recipes. I have tried to find recipes by way of the index. Recipes are often not on the designated page. I have had to search through the book looking for a recipe. Sometimes it's 5 pages away from where it's supposed to be. Sloppy sloppy editing and a waste of my time.
1,Watch Out,"Borrowed this book from the library. I liked it so much that I bought a coppy. It is just what I have been looking for. I particulary liked the section on frozen foods. However, the copy that was sent to me was the first edition and not the 2nd revised edition. It does not have the frozen food section. I also noticed that the cover shown on the advert is for the revised section edition. As I live in New Zealand it is difficult to return the item. I may have to copy the missing section from the library book. I will never buy from the seller again."
2,Canning Recipes,"This book is a great idea but not very well executed. The recipes are smaller which is nice but I was disappointed that many of them are supposed to be stored in the refrigerator. That's leftovers NOT food preservation. There are several better books out there--The new Ball Complete Book of Home Preserving is absolutely the best and most reliable book and has many small batch recipes included. If you can find copies of Sunset Home Canning (1993), The Food Lover's Guide to Canning (1997) or Canning by Sue and Bill Deeming (1983) you will have a wealth of reliable, creative canning recipes."
2,Fair,"The description of the book makes it sound like it walks you through putting up produce in smaller batches when it is in fact recipes for jams, jellies, condiments etc. I have hundreds of those - would not have purchased this book had I been able to look at it first."
2,It's okay but hard to watch for one reason...,"I was actually at this pay per view live, so I picked up this DVD. Allthough it really isn't a bad wresting show at all, you can't forget that on the night of this pay per view Chris Benoit was absent from the show. He was busy killing himself after brutally murdering his wife and child in their Georgia home. With this constantly in the back of your mind, it is very hard to watch this show."
1,Save Your Money...This Was A Stinker,I was at the PPV and it was a colossal waste of time and money. edge vs. Batista was the only half-decent match. No surprise that it stunk since WWE barely put the card together the week before the show. It's the last PPV I plan to attend. Do yourself a favor and save your money.
1,Off Base,I read this book and the concept of Cleaving between men is not biblical in the sense that it is used in this book. God called man and women to cleave together or for us to cleave to himself but never to be emotionally intangled with another man. This book teaches the ungodly principle of emotional entanglement with the same sex. Yes there is a need for healthy male friendships but this book is not the path to follow. I would not recommend this book at all.
2,So unlike HP,"This item does not work correctly! It's anybody's guess as to what drivers to use. After hit or miss selection, the sensor fails to correctly read the fingerprint swipe. I have trieds dozens of times without proper registration. My old APC BIOPOD works well but it is not as stylish as the HP. For once, function wins out over form."
2,Pretty much a JD pattern.,"1. Carlito vs Ric Flair *** 1/4 - Their best encounter yet. Very hot opener and the crowd was into it. Carlito did a great job in there.2. Lashley vs Team MaMahon N/A - Too short but as a segment, it's pretty entertaining.3. CM Punk vs Elijah Burke *** 1/2 MOTN - These guys went out there and gave it all. They showcased their talent and I believe had the most time.4. HBK vs Randy Orton N/A - Nothing happen here. They should've had Orton win though to get him more over.5. The Hardy Boyz vs Cade & Murdoch *** 1/4 - C & M has gotten better. Very good match.6. Edge vs Batista *** - I'm being a bit nice here. Just mediocre.7. MVP vs Benoit *** - Not least good match. It's stupid to have a 15 minute 2/3 Falls match. The crowd were dead also. Nice counter-wrestling as usual though.8. John Cena vs The Great Khali ** 1/4 - Khali. 'Nuff said.Overall worth a pass of course, had a nice set of match but just mediocre."
5,This is great fun!,"I am really enjoying this DVD. Eli Newsom is an excellent teacher and really breaks the steps down so that a novice can understand them. The inset pictures of his dancing feet really help. Dancing to the piano music makes it even more fun! Before I know it an hour has gone by. The PDF User Guide is also helpful since I live in a small town where there are no adult tap classes. This is the most fun I've had in a long time. Thanks, Eli!"
2,Not so Accurate Scale,"I suppose it's true, if it's too good to be true...it is! This scale has not accurately weighed postage while on battery, always showing approximately twice as much as the actual weight. It is a little closer when plugged in to the power cord, but still is not accurate enough for me to trust.....am still having to head to the post office and have them check the weight/postage I have on it. So far, and don't think this is going to suddenly correct itself, have either been over or needed additional postage. Shopper beware....I'd keep looking for a postage meter, if doing again, and not stop here just because of the low price!"
2,Inaccurate...Read the Return Policy,"I ordered the WeighMax 35lb Postal Scale and was very disappointed with it. When weighing the same parcel several times, it gave me several different weights. I finally took the parcel to USPS and it weighed completely different there. Also, when using the AC Adapter the first day, the product gave several error messages and would shut off when I did not want or expect it to. When I tried to use the 9 Volt Battery instead, it would not fit properly into the machine and also gave error messages. I actually had to return the product and bought a scale locally instead.If you decide to purchase this scale...PLEASE READ THE RETURN POLICY FIRST! This is the first issue I've ever had with an Amazon product in five years so I never read the return policy beforehand! Even though the product was obviously defective, I still had to pay the initial shipping and handling charges."
1,Don't buy this--piece of JUNK!,I had this for maybe 30 days...barely used it. Just died on me! Don't buy this!
5,I LOVE THIS CD,I've had this thing since it came out with alot of other good projects from Pendragon and it still remains among my favorite three albums in my ENTIRE music collection. So original and so clean for so many sounds at once. Just absolute art.
1,A wolf gains friends through a book he buys.,"It doesn't seem that the author has been in the children's section of the library lately. The parents that would be likely to buy this book for their child probably frequently the library. They might also be taken aback that the wolf cannot read the dusty library book with any enthusiasm, and even more so when the wolf reads a book and becomes friends with the animals after reading the book he bought from a bookstore. I would never share this book with any child. It suggests spending money on material goods is the way to make friends."
5,Super book!,Using this book at a follow up for a vocabulary workshop that I took recently. Love it! Great enriching vocabulary and so much fun!
3,I want DVD,I love this cartoon as a kid and I want it so bad so I give cartoon 5 stars but the fact that its on vhs is the reason I put 3 come on why is this not on dvd?
2,"Great message, but the in-your-face style was a downer","This collection of poems is an in-your-face protest of the hypocrasies of sexual stereotypes in the U.S., including het, gay, lesbian, BDSM, etc. The confrontational style of the work was, for me, wasn't useful. While it exposed the stereotypes, it created no sympathy for the oppressed."
3,Good EQ,The is a good EQ. The only draw back is that the mid eq frequency control is set at 1K HZ. Many other 4 band model's mid range control is set at 2.5K HZ. Otherwise it does fine.
5,I found this book to be quite entrancing,"After reading one cheesy vampire book after another, I became tired of these ""modern"" vampire stories. I preferred the classic vampire stories such as Jeane Kalogradis's vampire trilogy, but this book was great."
3,"Good, but has continuity problems with the earlier SB story.","While fans of the Masquerade universe will find SB a welcome addition, the SB story loses its edge. The game playing framework hangs rather awkwardly on an elemental force like Sonya Blue."
3,a nice glimpse into Cimarron,"I worked at Philmont Scout Ranch outside of Cimarron for three years, two of those working for Steve Zimmer at the Kit Carson Museum at Rayado. Having read this book, I feel it provides a rather insightful glimpse into the lives of some of the people and events that have added some color to the history of Colfax County. It is organized in a series of short (average of about 10 pages) essays and stories concerning those figures (i.e. Kit Carson, Clay Allison, Black Jack Ketchum, etc.,.) that is both informative as well as easy to read."
4,2007 collector car price guide,"Up to date ,very good information,I use it all the time with my appraisal business."
5,Industrial at its best,great cd as always with VAC. this ones most memorable track for me is malfunction. just has a incredible depressive machine feel to it.
5,Easy fitting Ipod holder,"Fits in my Jeep cupholder perfectly with the standard cup base, but it also comes with 2 other sizes. Without a case on the Ipod, it fits perfectly and the suction-cup secures it from any movement. With a thin silicon case on the Ipod, it still fits in tightly, and no need for a suction-cup. It also swivels around and tilts a little bit, so you can view your Ipod at the best angle. If you are in the car a lot, this product is well worth the money."
3,Scratches the sides of your iPod!,"Yep, it's a well thought product, but manufacturers miss one tiny detail:We iPod users love to protect our device from scratches, bumps, etc. We love to keep it as good as new, therefore, when I noticed that my TuneDok's side flaps were scratching my iPod's metal sides, I got really disapointed.If you don't mind this, go ahead and buy the TuneDok, because it actually is everything else Belkin says it is."
3,Great for a naked iPod,"If you have a naked iPod this device is great. However, I just as most people have a protective casing for my iPod. This means that my iPod is a little thicker, which does not allow it to fit in the holster. I recommend companies to start making accessories to fit iPods with protective casings."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!!,"WARNING!!DO NOT ORDER THIS PRODUCT!!I recieved my order today and it only contains 3 colors!!The colors: Brown, Black, Gray, and Tan were ALL missing and replaced with a dark green while the package still listed all 7 (as advertised)!!This product is a rip off!! Don't waste your time or money!!"
2,"Great salt, but be aware of very hard crystals","I love this product for how natural and whole it is. I think the salt has a wonderful mild flavor and I know my body is benefiting from all the minerals that are in it.However, I have one MAJOR issue with this product and that is the fact that it contains a lot of hard crystals, some send, etc. These crystals do not dissolve and if you bite on it, it will sound crunchy and even painful.Unfortunately, I've tried this product on 4 different occasions to make sure it wasn't just a bad batch, and they all had crystals that don't dissolve.I'm sad to report that I chipped two of my teeth over a period of 2 months. The chips are microscopic, but I do have quite a bit of sensitivity in those teeth. Also, if your teeth are naturally prone to sensitivity, I would presume this product would irritate them even more.Great idea, but the filtration process leaves little bit too much of inpurities behind."
1,"Beware, sand and rocks mixed in","Did not purchase from Amazon, but from local 'Follow Your Heart' health food store in Los Angeles. Used some on breakfast and noticed gritty texture. Took my mortar and pestle and tried to pulverize as much as possible. Tried it again, and all I got was same sand and rocks, just in a smaller size. Those dark, almost black chips are rocks, that is why I had such a difficult time pulverizing. Returned this to the store and asked them to remove it from the shelves because someone might get hurt. They are still selling it after several weeks. I then purchased Celtic Sea Salt that is sold on Amazon which is actually a really delightful, tasty salt."
4,Very nice low-end solution,"For the most part, this does exactly what it says it will. It allows switching of X number of devices, and it does it automatically. Several times, however, I have had it switch between devices on its own when I have not changed anything. I have been in 1 very intense Xbox Live game and it decided to switch away from Xbox to the satellite on its own, even though I had not powered on/off anything. All in all, though, even though that was supremely frustrating, that's about the worst I can say about it. Nice very expensive solution to 4 devices going into my TV. =:)I can't comment as to how good the quality of the signal is--I don't claim to be an expert at that at any level. But the product does exactly what it says it does. I recommend it. =:)"
1,Don't buy,Lasted a few weeks and then died. Got a replacement and that died too. Company sent me a carry case for my PS2 because they gave up making it. Can't imagine why.
3,Ladder Match,"My son loves this DVD. I'm glad Amazon had it, we could not find it in the stores, great low price too!"
4,Comprehensive Guide for Conventional & Alternative Meds,"880 page volume contains much information about commonly prescribed drugs, over the counter products, as well as natural remedies. It even includes Aromatherapy oils. Alphabetically arranged, the guide is easy to use. A standard format is used throughout for fast review of information. Each listing includes drug class, brand names, other drugs in this class, warnings, special information, target ailments, drug interactions, availability, side-effects (both serious and not serious). Includes facts on Natural Remedies, aromatherapy, Chinese Medicine, Homeopathy, Vitamins and Minerals, Herbs, and when drugs and natural remedies don't mix. A wealth of data in one book. Very useful."
5,Great movie in a classic mode,This movie is great if you like classic songs by Cole Porter. It's told beautifully and the film is lovely to watch. Quite a nice find!
3,Could have been much better...,"De-Lovely was certainly better than I expected, but I still didn't enjoy the framing effect. I think the merits of the story (Cole Porter's lifestory) was strong enough without creating this bizarre ""This is Your Life"" frame.Moreover, the frame itself was odd. If the point of Kevin Kline's make-up was to make him look like Carl Reiner, why not just hire Carl Reiner? And am I the only one who is frightened of Jonathan Pryce? He can be done anytime now.The songs I thought worked very well - in most cases improving on their (somewhat narrow) appeal from the soundtrack (especially Alanis Morrissette). The big exception here was the stagnant rendition of ""Just One of Those Things"" by Diana Krall. Not sure why, but she doesn't seem to get the song.Kevin Kline is yummy. That's all I can say."
4,MUSICALS NEVER DIE,"I love Cole Porter's story, I love the musical numbers that you can see in this film, the cast is almost perfect, the only thing that I don't like it how the story is narrated in the script( I mean Cole Rewieng his life) but for the rest of the film, is terrific. Don't miss it. It's DE-Lovely."
4,De-Lovely,Wonderful backdrop of Cole Porter musical compositions along with fine acting within a novel script.
5,For the Little Baker,"Bought this for my niece who loves to watch and help her mom bake cupcakes in the kitchen, now she has her own set that she can help make and decorate pretty cupcakes, Great Price, Great Buy."
3,Cheap,"My kids were so excited about this product. It's lots of fun to use! The frosting gun is difficult for little ones to use and is not the highest quality, but overall this is still a nice product."
1,terrible fit,"Bought 2 pairs of these in different colors. Wore 1 pair once. So uncomfortable, altho they looked really nice. Had to give away."
5,So Hard to turn off,"Oh My, Im not the least bit suprised. If it's JE it has got to be a PRIZE. This cd is filled with realistic thought out lyrics. There are not to many songs that are fillers. This cd has a mix of uptempo party songs and slow tempo bed time songs. Im impressed! My favorite songs is In the Morning, What's It Like and Walk Right Outta Heaven. But I can listen to the cd from top to bottom and that matters along during these times. ONE LOVE!!!!"
5,they did it again,"I agree, if you give this album less than 5 stars then you don't know what you're talking about. This is an awesome CD...much to my delight since I have been waiting for an awesome follow up to Jagged Little Thrill. My favorites, practically everything! JE, ya'll did it again. Now ya'll gonna keep me waiting anxiously for your next album."
2,A far cry from J.E.'s past performances,"I had never purchased a Jagged Edge album before this one but I had heard, and loved many songs off of them. Gotta Be, Let's Get Married, True Man, Goodbye and the list goes on. The songs were great and I vowed to buy the next album they released. If only that album hadn't been Hard. I purchased the cd and gave it several play throughs only to give a cry in disgust.Most of the songs on this album are weak. The album seems to focus more on J.E.'s uptempo songs and well... they just aren't that great. Walked outta heaven is a great song and Hard is acceptable as well. If it weren't for these two songs... I'm not sure I would even have given the album a star.The group needs to stick with their slower songs. It's when they shine."
3,Negotiation,"I think these types of books work better when they diagram and use modeling as a method to teach. Like many books I read, there was a sense of repetitiveness. I think overall it is a good introductory book for negotiation skills, but not what I was looking for."
4,Good for starters,This book will teach you the basics about Negotiation. You will learn everything from the basic steps of agreement up to the top.
5,Excellent,The book was in perfect condition! Amazon is the best solution to purchasing textbooks for school.
5,Great book!,I really enjoyed this book. This is coming from a student who took this as a requirement and was not looking forward to taking the class.
2,poor,"didn't like the conditions of the book. almost all pages are torn, and it looks worse than any used text book which i have ever used."
1,gateway digital jukebox-a scam for for your money,"I purchased this as a gift for my husband. The unit has shut down and scrambled songs twice. The unit has been replaced twice. They never repair, only replace it with another dysfunctional unit. Customer service is horrible!! No support from Gateway. What a mistake. Do not buy this unit!!!!!!! You will kiss 300 dollars good-bye!"
5,Through the eyes of children,The stories are based on important themes that children can relate to. It serves an important role in assisting kids to process these painful issues in psychotherapy.
2,Too small in size,"I was very disappointed with the size of the instruments in this set. Even though it is for a 1 year old, it is entirely too small. I feel this won't hold my grandson's interest at all. I would not recommend this for a 1 year old."
4,Not for husky children.,"We just received the car seat that looks great, however, our husky two and a half year old son already looks a bit cramped in the shoulders. This seat may be better for slightly built children. I do really like the adjustable headrest, and the strap are easy to adjust. I am disappointed that is will not work out for us."
2,Do not buy,It is rediculous they would put something like this out for sale. You can not see a darn thing around you. A waste of money. We ended up sending it back because my son could not see anything.
1,"Becareful, Unstable, unsafe","This carseat is not stable and unsafe. It can be rocked by hand and if your child leans too much it can tilt on it's side. What would force from impact in an accident cause. A latch would help tremendously. We were disappointed as it looked comfortable and read well as a safe seat. NO matter how we worked the straps it could not secure our 3 year old.Unfortunately return was a poor experience. IF you want to try it purchase only one seat at a time (if you have two cars) you pay return if disatisfied. We will return to other carseat companies that stand behind customer satisfaction and security. Safety first, Eddie Bauer 3in 1 keep up the good work!"
5,Absolutely wonderful,"The book is an absolutely wonderful tribute to Rod McDonald. Like his work, it covers all areas of psychometrics from classical test theory to item response theory to covariance structure modeling. The topics range from those of historical interest such as rotational indeterminancy to the most state of the art advances in the field such as modeling time series processes. Other chapters integrate topics into cohesive frameworks, such as the chapter by Marsh, Hau, and Grayson on goodness of fit, the chapter by Harlow which focuses on the themes underlying multivariate statistics, and the chapter by Maydeu-Olivares which provides a unified framework for item response theory and covariance structure modeling. I highly recommend the book to those in the field of psychometrics; it is an indispensable resource for the field."
3,Not among my favorite books on my shelf,"Although I discovered some helpful tips, this book will not appeal to painters who are interested in realistic, detailed representations. It is more for those that lean toward rough impressionistic methods."
5,"This is very nice,",I have not put it together but it looks great and comes in a very nice bag. It is light weigh and very slender but large just what I was looking for.
5,A thorough reference to Fortran 95.,"This is not a textbook, but it is an important reference for the Fortran 95 programmer. It covers the features inherited from Fortran 77 as well as the new features in Fortran 90 and 95."
1,History,"This book is not as thorough as I thought. It does have many interesting stories of local events and it tells about history that occurred just to the north in Greene County, Pennsylvania. I wish it had more references to the earlier families of wetzel County, but that will have to wait until another author takes on this task."
5,Saving for a person missing teeth,"As soon as I read this book, I could find the power of this book. As a man who will be a dentist in future, if not reading this book, we will not treat a patient. this book contain a various views including biology, mechanics, technics, esthenics and medicine. If you can this book, you will Save many patient so comfortablly. good luck for your future!"
3,thick but ....,"When I first saw this book delivered, I was a little bit shocked with large volume. But, I thought that large font, colorful photos and cleanly designed layout makes it worthful for its price.In field of fixed prosthetic dentistry, there is no recent publication except but a few case review series. If we wants to review this book, we would get a better chance to rehabilitate oral health of our patients in a good status with pain-free, esthetic and functional masticatory system."
5,Greatest DVD I own,"I am not an expert in sound etc. but I can tell you one thing, I love this DVD. His voice is so pure. Some of the songs bring tears to my eyes!"
2,Very Cheap Speakers,I did not keep these for very long. Might be okay to run a home stereo through. No more than about 50 solid state watts. Came with pieces of cabinet and 1 horn driver laying loose inside. They're just cheap cheap cheap. Better to spend a little more and get some Kustoms. Kustom kpc10's easily out perform these.
4,So soft!,"This puppy is super soft. His feet and the insides of his ears are fantastically soft. He does not sit up like the picture, but lays like a pillow. Mine does not seem to have any prickly fur like a previous reviewer had. I machine washed him and he didn't seem to mind."
2,"This film is a major disappointment, with Hoffman miscast.","This film is a major disappointment. It's primary flaw is, I hate to say it, Dustin Hoffman. He's just not funny. I sat through the whole movie and did not chuckle once at any of Bruce's routines as interpreted by Hoffman. I guess that shows how important timing and delivery is in comedy; obviously, Hoffman has neither. Lenny Bruce was not only a very thought provoking social commentator, but he was really funny. As a result, Hoffman was totally unconvincing to me as the comedian. Besides the problem with Hoffman, the movies ""gritty' black and white cinamatography and documentary type look was overblown and pretentious. Lenny Bruce was a great and important comic of the early 1960s. He deserves a better film biography, maybe someday, someone will give us one."
1,"IT IS A GOOD MOVIE, BUT . . . .","AN AMERICAN MOVIE - ONLY AVAILABLE IN EUROPE/OVERSEAS AND CANNOT BE PLAYED ON U.S. DVD PLAYERS!!!THE REGION / PAL CODING RESTRICTIONS IS SO ABSURD - ONLY THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD LAPTOP COMPUTERS THAT HAVE 'REGION FREE' - NO RESTRICTIONS CAN USE THESE REGION 4/WHATEVER DVD'S - BUT THEIR SCREENS ARE SMALL . . . SO WE ALL IN AMERICA SUFFER!AMAZON AND MOST SELLERS DO NOT INFORM CUSTOMERS IN ANY OF THIS . . . YOU BUY, YOU LOSE."
2,Stale and Greasy,"I usually love these cheese and peanut butter crackers, but these are probably the worst I've ever had. The peanut butter was stale tasting and the crackers greasy and mushy. I don't know if these were just old (I couldn't find a date on the package.) or if the Keebler product just isn't as good as other brands, but I'll never buy these again. I'll stick to the Lance or Austin brands for future purchases."
4,Good Buy,"Good product for me, Especially for the CANON POWERSHOT SX110IS...has alot of patches and room for all i need!! not really for a camcorder though..."
2,Slighty dissappointed,"I bought this bag for my JVC Everio MG465. The Lowepro website says this bag is 'compatible'with this camera. But it's a half-half solution.The camcorder fits in the bag, but the accessory-compartments are too small. I can't take a medium battery and a poweradapter with me at the same time. I regret not buying a larger model or the official JVC bag without compartments. I rather take the accessories in the bag or totally apart from that, not half in the bag and half outside the bag.Therefor; disappointing."
1,its sucks,it sucks unless your at close range i meen go on amazon and search airsoft starter kits get that m16 only cost like 120$ plus it shoots 400 fps and comes with 8000 bbs and some other neat stuff
5,Worth while,This gun is a must buy it is not to heavy even with the m203 which is spring the battery is put in the m203. The gun comes with 2 clips I strongly advise if your like me a runner get more standard mags they run out quickly. if you want a strong durable and reliable gun this is it
2,gun broke after 2 weeks,this is a very great gun that is very accurate for target practice. But the gear box got messed up and the gun broke after 2 weeks. plus the under barrel shotgun gets jammed and u cant unjam it.
1,Junk with crappy instructions!,"What a piece of junk! My 12-year-old son saved his money and paid for this himself. He was so happy when it was finally delivered today. He's had the gun for about eight hours, and it has plastic pieces that have broken already. The instructions are the usual crap you get when you buy junk. Pictures that are so small or blurry that you can't see them. Incomplete instructions. Unless you're going to put this gun on the shelf as a decoration, don't waste your money. If I could have, I would have given it 0 stars."
1,Just Awful!,"This movie was just awful on soooo many levels, that it's truly ""frightening""!Trust me. My collection of movies is near 1,000, 40% of them are Horror movies. I grew up in the 70's and 80's watching TRUE ""Cult Classics"", such as The Hills have Eyes, and a Nightmare on Elm St.both by Wes Craven, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre by Tobe Hooper, Zombie 2 by Lucio Fulci, even Halloween and Friday the 13th. But this...OMG! Truly and absolutly HORRIBLE!Not worthy of CULT CLASSIC status, or even a good B movie for that matter. I implore you, don't waste your time with this one, you'll thank me later."
1,Rawhead Rex,The DVD sent will not play in my Blue Ray player. Waste of good money. I have given it away to a friend to see if it works in their DVD player. I give it one star for showing up.
1,"Wasted potential, a lot of wasted potential","This could have been so great, but Rawhead Rex is nothing more than wasted potential. Clive Barker's original story was truly frightning and horrifying, and Barker should have written and directed this movie and it wouldn't have been so bad. There is so much to critique here I don't know where to begin, so I'll just leave it at that."
3,"So bad, it's good.","I saw this on video back in the olden days and thought it was pretty cool. Having seen it recently, I have to confess it is quite awful. It is still very watchable in a ""so bad, it's good"" kind of way. There is a fair bit of ropey gore and even urination on a priest(you don't see that every day). Rawhead himself is laughable. He looks like an orc auditioning for Judas Priest. The awkward close-ups of his rubbery hands breaking crockery while he's supposed to be chasing a woman through her home, kind of kill the tension.Clive Barker's short story is ideal material for an awesomely brutal monster movie. This needs to be remade by a director who really cares about the source material. By the way, Rawhead isn't a demon trapped in the depths of hell, he's an ancient monster buried alive under a big rock. End of rant."
2,"I remembered it fondly, but...","I saw this when I was a kid and thought it was scary. I recently purchased it and watched it again, and it was a lot better in my memory than in real life. This flick actually has a fairly decent plot and would be OK if not for FFM-full frontal monstrosity within the first 30 minutes...any good horror director should know to keep the view of latex masks obscured at least until a good halfway through the film. Rex's cheezy effects are there for full viewing in about 5 long close-up scenes. If you can overlook the awful effects, it's an OK picture."
1,100% CHEESE GRADE B,"Rawhead Rex is the worst,and I mean the worst movie I've seen. Is it supposed to be this funny,I mean the scene where he urinates on the preist ,hilarous. I can't believe this is on DVD,what a waste of time and discs."
3,"I want to love it, but...","After 20 years of sewing, this is my first dressform... as such, it's opened up a world of convenience to me and promises to greatly improve the fit of my garments. BUT, the instructions are worthless! Glyphs instead of text, and the instructions for three markedly different dressforms are included on one page and are hard to distinguish. I've mostly figured out how to adjust it. But, although the box and ad for my dressform say that I should be able to adjust the back length (a must for me, I'm long-waisted,) I have yet to succeed at changing the factory setting. I e-mailed the manufacturer (not the seller) last week and they have not yet responded with any guidance. Disappointing!!"
5,"A very clear, and balanced view of all engine components","This book covers every major engine component and is a great primer on combustion theory, while being very easy to read and understand. Diagrams, drawings and photos tell you what to do and why - or why not to do it. Mr. Vizard presents everything within the context of what is practical and worthwhile for ""streetability,"" vs. what else might make sense for all-out racing performance. What a great book for anyone who wants to add HP, even those with no idea where to begin!"
3,Interesting series,"Pretty good story but I found the heroine, Isabelle, incredibly annoying most of the time with her holier-than-thou airs and self-righteous posturing. Jake was a little dumb but I was fascinated with the orphans. Each and every one of them were very interesting characters.Honestly, I only recommend this book because it is part of a rather interesting series that contains some very good stories.This story contains graphic love scenes."
2,Product Ingredients,"I cannot fairly rate this product. When it was was ordered, I was unaware that it contained soy. I didn't break the seal of the bottle, immediately returned it, and the company was good about crediting my account. There are CLA products on the market void of soy."
1,A Difference of Opinion,"According to Jeremy Grantham, founder of GMO and manager of $48 billion (that's billion with a ""B"") in assets, the market is currently overpriced with a trailing P/E of 24. The trendline P/E is about 16 and Tanaka suggests in his book that it should be even higher than 24.In fact, Grantham reasons that the expected annual returns on large cap and small cap U.S. stocks over the next 7 years to be 1.4% and 2.5%, not some ultra bull market that Tanaka is suggesting that is driven by growing PE's.Why should we listen to Grantham? Simply put, he is respected in the investment community and has $48 billion to prove it."
1,"Dow 30,000","Sadly, another book like Dow 20,000 attempting to justify the excessive valuations of equities in their portfolio. You'd think one would learn that there is no ""new economy"" after the last bubble where these technology buffs lost more then half of their assets (perhaps that doesn't mean too much to a portfolio manager, after all it's not their money they're losing), but hope is a good thing, it's just no substitute for research.Were steel, concrete, railroads, the transatlantic telegraph, aircraft, or electricity any less revolutionary when they appeared? Certainly not. It's just that those with a myopic view of history somehow believe that the era in which they occupy is ""new"". It may be recent, but it's not new."
4,"There is only one Blanche, and Neely's got her","A blurber once wrote for the cover of an Amanda Cross mystery that she reads Cross's Kate Fansler series for the ""conversation."" That's how I feel about the Blanche White series: read them for the company. I fell off the dedicated mystery reading wagon years ago, so I'm out of the league when it comes to rating the whodunit part, except to say it did not seem too obvious or too illogical. This is the third in the series, the best to date. Blanche is so very fully realized, so complex, her voice so powerful that by contrast the other characters come off a little thin at times. I share Neely's glee in making evil drip from every pore of the right-wing political types and their bedfellows. Through Blanche, though, she also offers more evenhanded contemplations on the social realities of the working poor and race."
2,Intercom's,They took forever to get here. Finally Rec'd package 11-3+12. When we tried to use they the Intercom's did not work.They have been returned. This order was not a good experience.
2,Disatisfied,"Ordered 4 of these units, 2 did not work. The bad 2 were replaced without problem, 1 of the new 2 has a lot of static. I have used these products for years but now quality is not there."
1,JUNK,"These things are junk. They werked for a bit, then the speakers started makin noise, and now I kant even use them. 1,500 feet my a!@#, if they are not on the same circuit For-Get-It. Mine has completely stopped werking, inless they are two feet apart, and even then you kant here on them.NOVI WI-2C 2-Channel FM Wireless Intercom"
1,This Did Not Work!,"Oh how I wished this would have worked. I needed an intercom to communicate with my 91-year-old mother who has a downstairs bedroom. We had an intercom with a wire that ran up and downstairs but stopped working after 8 years. I could not find another wired intercom anymore and figured these would be a nice new alternative. Unfortunately, this did not work at all! I basically needed this to use in the event my mom needed to alert me in an emergency. I rarely return items, but this intercom system was returned to Amazon and they graciously accepted."
4,Lots of info,I purchased it for my trip in June of 2006 and learned so much from it. The book is really useful and contains lots of valuable advice. The only thing about it is that there were a few areas that were out of date. I still recommend it.
5,Saved my rainwater tank,"This is great. Regular screens just clog up with silt, but this stopped the debris and let the water out. Sure every so ofter it helps to clean it out, but it is all right there. I have now used them for 3 years and will get more."
4,awesome!,"i like how they were able to change some songs while still keeping them as ""original"" as they could. this new lead vocalist (pangie or nando, can't seem to remember his name) brings to the group what dj kane did. peewee's not bad either! this is a must own, and not just for the single ""pachuco""!"
2,Overrated,"I read prodigiously, and this is the most disappointing debut novel I've ever read. It pales in comparison to Ian McEwan's spine chilling The Comfort of Strangers.With its weak utterly preposterous plot, Strangers on a Train is an insult to anyone's intelligence. The actions of Guy, the guy who's being stalked, are so unbelievable - not to say asinine - that I found them irritating. The private investigation into all the murders was equally unbelievable and downright farcical! Read the other 2 star review on here. It's right on the money!I should have just watched the movie. The book drags on and on for nearly 300 pages towards a most unsatisfying anticlimactic ending, which I don't want to give away. A waste of time. Pick up any ""hard"" novel by Georges Simenon. I recommend Dirty Snow, The Widow, The Train, and particularly The Man who Watched Trains Go By and The Engagement (!). And of course, the Comfort of Strangers by Ian McEwan."
4,You've got to REALLY like models (and I don't mean pretty women in swimsuits),"I grew up with this show. And I remember it looked so cool. I was not exactly disappointed, but just surprised at how much of each episode consists of lovingly-shot sequences with the tiny models they used. This is probably just as well, as I think the model work stands up better than the marionettes. The action sequences make you alternate between thinking ""Boy, that looks pretty realistic for a model,"" and ""How did they do that with models?"" It's always hard to know which of your childhood favorites to risk watching again, and I'm not sure I'll rush out to try and find Kimba the White Lion or Marineboy (though I would watch Speed Racer in a minute), but this is very enjoyable and just slightly odd."
4,Beautifully Written,"I don't read much fiction, but I saw this book on Amazon and decided to pick it up. I'm glad I did, because then I couldn't put it down. The author has the rare ability to give thorough descriptions of people and places without getting heavy or dull. I majored in Literature in college, and have had a hard time finding really good writing in a novel. There are many interesting stories, but the writing itself leaves a lot to be desired. I would've enjoyed reading this even if it weren't such a gripping story, but it has that, too. I learned a lot about the Russian revolution in a painless, interesting way. Definitely worth the time to read."
4,Great even if you don't speak italiano,"Full Disclosure: The bits of the Italian language I can understand are those I picked up from my Grandma screaming at me when I was a kid.Still, I love this album. It's pure and joyful pop and the language barrier doesn't really matter. I saw Alex Britti perform on New Year's Eve 98 at the Forum in Rome. The crowd went crazy for him and after I heard the song that is track 2 on this album ""Solo Una Volta"" I knew I'd be buying the album the next day. I did and I don't regret it. Alex performed with just acoustic guitar when I saw him, but the arrangements are nicely fleshed out here. There are at least 5 songs on this album that you will end up singing along with even though you don't know what you are saying. Give it a shot. In a lot of ways he's stylistically close to Jovanotti (see the Soprano's soundtrack vol 2).Correction: The song the other guy who reviewed this is talking about ""una su un milione"" is not on this album. It is on La Vasca. Buy that too."
4,Fascinating Cold War story,Destination Berlin is a taut espionage story set in Cold War era Germany. The author's military knowledge is woven throughout the story giving it authenticity. The intriguing relationship between Sharon and Dimitri is like a roller coaster ride and the reader is drawn into their story. This book would make an ideal teaching tool for young people studying this era - although recent history to many of us it is already unknown to newer generations. Cardin writes a fast paced story and has the knack for blending the different elements well to produce an interesting read. Definitely worth reading and let's hope she writes many more.
1,VERY BAD,"I buy three of these apparatuses and they do not serve for anything. They do not work nor to 5 meters. He is but the bad thing that has made that prestigious mark (I order the Novi mark but they dispatched three to me Westinghouse). Those apparatuses are a swindle, sincerely, if they could give back them the haria which happens is that it buys them in amazon and I took to another one pais to them and to give back them to costaria the double me. But in truth they are very bad, deficient, do not serve. Laura Piedra"
4,Purchased for a British ex-patriot returning to the UK,"Very amusing, particularly to Brits. Purchased as a gag gift for a British ex-pat returning home to the UK for a trip."
5,Purpose Served,I like the wall mount rack. It serves its purpose which is to keep my bike up off of the floor and save space.
3,doesn't look as pictured,"It's a quality product, but don't expect it to be all black as amazon presents. The bars that extend from the bracket to the hook area are actually gray metal. Don't buy if you need the black to match an all black color scheme in your apartment. Unexpected colors will hold you back."
2,This book is a waste of money...,"It truly is. There are no big tips, no clear instructions. It's a complete waste. Go with anything else before you buy this book."
4,This slim book helped tremendously !,"Bring this book home with your new puppy. Straightforward, easy to follow advice takes the heartbreak out of housebreaking. There are realistic, step-by-step training outlines for every type of household schedule. The best gift you can give to a new dog owner !"
4,great instructor,The instructions given in this book are easy to follow and gives the desired purpose. I am training my 3 month puppy and is very successful.
2,More relevant for older pups (12 weeks and up),"Although the summary and reviews said that this book was good for puppies, it is really meant for older pups (4 months and up). For anyone housebreaking a puppy, most of the puppy books have better information for the younger puppies (8-12 weeks)."
2,ehhh,"I was kind of disappointed by this book because it didnt tell me anything that I didnt know already. The one thing that I did learn was that you cant really potty train a dog until its 4 months old because it doesnt have bladder control...which I actually read in another book later. Honestly, the best way to potty train your dog is to leave him/her for a weekend with a friends dog that is already potty trained. They learn things from a pack so much more quickly then they do from you. My dog used to go in the house at least 2 times a day, I went out of town and left her with my friend who also has a dog and she came back scratching the door when she needed to go. That following week she only went one time in the house, it was AMAZING. Sorry...a bit of a tangent, but thought some people may find it helpful. All in all...skip the book and just google your info youll learn everything thats in this book."
5,It worked on a Basset!,"I followed the instructions in this book and housebroke a notoriously hard-to-housebreak Basset hound in ... well, okay, it took 10 days. I lent my copy out to another new-puppy owner and it was never returned, so now I'm ordering another copy to refresh my memory for the next puppy in my life."
5,Easy read and good suggestions,This book is short and easy to read. It gives you a good understanding of the basics of dog training. Short and to the point.
4,Good common Sense,"Concise little book with helpful information including the psychology behind why a puppy behaves as he does, & why & how as a trainer/owner, you should behave toward your pup in training."
3,Bird Repeller,"This product is workable and does keep the unwanted birds away. It's not exactly what I expected, but it works."
2,"It may be sexy, but definately not smart","I knew this book was going to be pretty hard to enjoy starting on about page 2--hijacking a pilot? Why? Bailey is already a stow away on a plane going exactly where she needs to go, so why bother revealing herself with a hijack when she could have just taken a nap and gotten there with no issues. How lucky that Noah's crush on the apparently hot Bailey is enough to make him risk his life for her--she's annoying, so why'd he stick around with her when his original plan was to hit the slopes and as many ski bunnies as possible I'll never know.Didn't like it. Its a Jill Shalvis book, so there are plenty of sex scenes, but for supposedly smart people on the run from the bad guys, they sure chose some stupid times to have sex. I have the other 2 books in the series from the library, but I'm not sure I'll give them any time."
4,I love Jill Shalvis,This isn't the best Jill Shalvis book I've read but it is good. All her books are good...some just better than others. Hers are the first I order and or buy.
4,A fun heavy converstion based film,"Over all this will only be liked by poeple who whish theycould write movies. I thought the movie moved along a suprising quick pace. The code only comes up once if I remember it correcrtly, it brings up a intresting thought or two. Overall I think the movie was overlooked Tim was really good in it."
4,Good Headphone Movie,"The saving graces of this movie are the soundtrack and cinematogrophy. I watched it with headphones. Very enjoyable. As for the story and the unaswered questions and unexplained motivations, don't worrry those are just the stylistic backdrop to what one reviewer here called an "" ambient"" movie."
2,It's ok,It lathers well but the Vanilla scent is just about non existing. I have 2 poodles and prefer a shampoo that leaves them smelling nice. This one has almost no smell at all.
3,Daughter thought it was OK.,"It was just OK, felt like it would break any moment and the sound wasn't that good."
3,Wireless intercomo,"The intercom system seemed to work well in another home, but for some reason not in my home; no explanation. In another home it was not completely static free (as advertised), but useable. The service by Amazon was outstanding full refund including shipping."
1,This system is junk,I bought this system for communication between our house and our barn 150 feet away on level land. I could not communicate at all...the crap system wouldn't even talk between the house and the attached garage. which is about 20 feet...they did work with the both units in the same room....which is useless...the company I bought them from would not refund my CC and referred me to the Westinghouse site...BEWARE this system is junk and not much better than a toy...
1,wireless intercom,Well the intercom did not work and I HAD TO PAY POSTAGE & INSURENCE to send it back. Would not buy from this store agagin! LBanks
1,Sad compared to older Models,"Just purchased 3 units , thought they would work as well as the Novi units they were replacing however they have absolutely no range . My original Novi 2 channel units worked well from a distance of approx 110 ft from house to barn , these only work in the same room... I am attempting to return these currently."
4,Check your box first.,"There is a lot of misinformation on this product. The intercoms do not have to be on the same circuit, they have to be on the same ""leg"" of electric. Every house has two ""legs"". They send an FM signal through the outlet and as long as they are on the same leg the units will communicate. This can be complicated if whole rooms are on one leg and others are on another. Here is a tip: go look at your electrical box, uasually things on the left side are on the A leg and things on the right on on the B leg. If the rooms you want to use are on the same leg then there is a great chance the outlets are as well. This is what I did. I knew going in that my kitchen was unfortunately on a different leg as my bedroom, so I had to put the downstairs unit in the dining room. When lined up they work perfectly. If things don't seem to line up an electrician can add a bridge (cheap). All better than the hardwire system, which was 3,200 for my house."
4,Beautiful,"This is a gorgeously illustrated and ultimately uplifting tale about finding both love and your place in the world. The Dillons (as usual) have outdone themselves, and I love the paper mache masks that accompany each illustration. The story itself as quite sad in places, but it will leave you smiling."
1,"Leaks, Leaks, & More Leaks","The beer machine leaks and there is nothing you can do about it. I only wish I would have done a google search on ""Beer Machine Leaks"" because I am clearly not the only one with this problem. Avoid this product unless you like mopping."
3,Avg performance.,"I got this as a gift with 3 different beers. I read the reviews and was very careful to assemble it carefully. I also used bottled water, and boiled it first per the instructions. It was easy enough to do, and I didn't get any leaks like others have. I generally left it for 3-4 days to brew, and 5-7 days to rest in the fridge. My primary problem with the beer is it doesn't brew a very good tasting beer. I've brewed 2 batches so far, a red and a 'lager'. They both brewed up pretty tasteless brews. The carbonation was low at first, but you can adjust with shots of co2.So over all, it wasn't that hard to do. It makes about 25 bottles of beer, which isn't bad for a bit over $10 a pack. I think it would make a fun gift, but for me the beer just doesn't taste very good for the work involved."
1,Just Does Not Cut It.....,"I had to return this scanner because it did not capture text near the edges of most of the business cards, no matter what I tried (Calibrating, Re-Orienting and re-feeding the cards). Updating the scanner drivers with the website download did not help. Visioneer's online support is unacceptably awful. Also, the bundled OCR software is not up to the task. The trial version of Corex Cardscan which I loaded for comparison performed much better with more accurate text recognition and field placement."
1,dont buy it!!!!!,"this is a piece of junk, it never worked fine, or the software crashes, or the scan results are terrible and very very slow."
1,Book slinging is back.,"Not since my high school geometry book have I felt more like slinging a book across the room. Not until reading A Ghost Among Us. The writing waffles, the storylines meander, the characters are cardboard cutouts and the dialogue is stilted. The only redeeming aspect of this work was the flashback segments set in Regency England about Jerome, the ghost into whose house three superficial party girls move. I can not in good conscious recommend this book to readers. However, writers, struggling to sell their own romances, might read this for encouragement. If this can get published -- your pet project can too!"
5,The A to Z's of American Cooking,"This is the first volume of the classic Family Circle Cook Book series ""Illustrated Library of Cooking"". Vol. 1 covers ""A - Bev"" and has 4 sections: (1) The A to Z's of Cooking; (2) American Classics from Coast to Coast; (3) Appetizers, and (4) Beverages. You won't be disappointed with this cookbook! The recipes are fool-proof - we have never been disappointed with the results of any of the preparations. The recipes include a broad slice of American cuisine and give you enough variety to keep your entertaining going time after time. THE JAMBALAYA RECIPE IS SIMPLE AND OUTSTANDING! Beautiful illustrations show you how to arrange and present the dishes attractively."
2,"Okay, but there's better out there...","A nice little song book, but there are much better arrangements to many of the same songs to be found in Jumpin' Jims books. What is nice is that there is tab for those who don't read music and want to play the notes. A big negative is that there are absolutely no chord diagrams in the book. If you don't know how to play a G chord on a uke, you need another book to show you how. I returned this book because the quality of the arrangements and lack of chord diagrams were unsatisfactory. If you're an absolute beginner you may appreciate the simple arrangements, but you'd still need another book to learn the chords."
3,"""They're coming to take me away""","This song cracked my whole family up when I was a kid and I recently decided to add it to my CD collection. In my search for a compilation that contained it, I came across Monster Hits and a few other CDs. Monster Hits was probably the best of the bunch for under $25. Many of the other songs are enjoyable to listen to and many will make you laugh or smile. Let's face it, these songs aren't winning any Grammy Awards BUT they are fun! If I could have, I'd have given the CD a 3.5. But since I had to choose between 3 & 4, I gave it a 3 because in my rating system, a four is reserved for Very Good CDs. This one is well worth buying if you are a fan of novelty songs."
4,Great Look Into Shawn's Career,"I felt this was a great DVD. It's the first WWE DVD I've bought, and I have to say I'm impressed. I liked the matches I saw, and the commentary was good. I felt it was a little short, and a few main things in Shawn's career were kind of looked over, especially his DX days and his time between the Austin Wrestlemania match and his return to the ring versus Triple H, but overall the DVD was great."
5,Perfect!,The description of the item was perfect. Our order was processed promptley and arrived on time. We will be ordering other items in the near future from these same folks.
3,Appropriate,"This book is a reasonably good and concise overview of the major elements of good design. Although the book has a small number of errors it is competently written and makes for a good touchstone for further reading. The further reading section within every ""principle"" are invaluable to putting the book into proper context."
5,The Hidden Principles That Makes Design Effective,"First off...I love design! And this book practices what it preaches. It's simply laid out in an easy to read format. The principles listed are explained in a clear, concise, coherent fashion, with example illustrations that help you understand the concept. You can apply them immediately to your projects. The principles talked about on each page also redirects you to the other relevant principles mentioned in the book. It's also a helpful way to conceptualize how 2 or more principles work together. Yet, the only thing that's going to stop you from applying them are the limits of your imagination. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who wants to make their product more effective."
2,Don't bother,"I got this book for Christmas, and was completley dissapointed. It isn't really a book becuase there is barely any writing. The pictures are great, but the writing is nothing. There is nothing in the way of content. And the tiny words are a pain and it is just not worth the money. If you only want pics of Oksana then it's great, but if you want something to read to actually learn about figure skating then get Boitano's Edge."
2,Net Media SCIR Indoor/Outdoor Weather-resistant IR Illuminator,This IR Illuminator was very weak. My IR sensitive cameras would only be able to see no more than 5 feet with this IR Illuminator. The range of this device was supposed to be 40 ft.
5,life vests,the life vest are great fitting different sizes of people.made good feel good.good quality.the snaps are easy to work .
3,"Good for the price, but.......","I really wasn't impressed with this Life Jacket. If I wasn't in such a hurry to get one, I probably wouldn't have purchased it. It did the job, but really didn't feel very comfortable making it hard to move around in."
4,Pretty good fun,"This movie isn't nearly as exciting as the remake, but it is quite a bit funnier. It seemed to be shooting for a whole different attitude, and it is a very amusing movie. It is quite exciting too."
3,British camp,A fun film with the likes of Benny Hill and location shoots throughout Italy. A bit slapstick and farcical but a fun 60's flick.
5,You cant not like it!,"Okay.... its hard to write about such a brilliant film without feeling silly. Sometimes the sheer power of the movie says enough. This is one of those movies. Every scene is done so well, every detail is thought out so well, every character is performed so well... you cant say anything bad about it. Everytime I show this movie to a friend they say the same things. They say it because they too are amazed. The plot, the cars -minis and alfas-(the brits vs. italia), the actors, the raw energy, everything! is perfect. A must have! I cant believe you dont already :P"
1,This is what all the fuss was about?,"I'd read about this movie for years in my British movie magazines. Apparently it's an institution over there. I can't imagine why. It's a badly dated film that plods along without any discernable humor or wit. Most of the dialogue is just characters endlessly explaining the plot, which still makes little sense despite all this exposition.The direction is badly paced and unfocused and the actors are eithed adrift or worse, like the talentless girl who plays Caine's girlfriend and sounds like she's reading her lines off cuecards while stoned. Yes she's gorgeous, but couldn't they have found a girl who could look good and also believably portray a human being.I wanted to turn this thing off by ten minutes in, but forced myself to keep it on in hopes that it would improve. It didn't. Avoid this at all costs, it's an hour and a half of your life you'll never get back."
3,Snips and snaps...,"Rented this video assuming it would be superior to the remake, and was frankly disappointed. It has a ""cut and paste"" feel: perhaps that was the filmmaker's intent; a sort of real-time, cameras-are-rolling sensation. There is no character development, and I didn't really care whether the crooks got away or not, truthfully.Michael Caine has the throw-away charm that he's known for; Noel Coward plays himself... It's harmless, good for a rainy afternoon as a substitute for cartoons. The frantic energy of The Chase seems to be the whole point of this one, whereas the 2003 edition paid more attention to the plotting/devising."
3,Ending could have been better,"Overall, the movie is ok except for the ending which is like a cliffhanger. It's like a Hitchcock movie letting you figure out what happened at the end. I like the new remake (2003) which is a lot better!"
2,Overrated,"There is some good stuff there, however, it is not funny, it is predictable and it is slow."
3,POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I am a fan of Sony products and been purchasing for last 15 years. I think there is no comparision with other similar products in market, though you pay a small price for it ( ~ 10% more).I puchased this TV at store. Very impressed with color quality especially with over the air HD signals and watching DVD on my vintage DVD player.Few days after use I noticed a crack on the outer panel - 1"" from the top right hand corner. Called store, called Sony, I haven't recieved a very satisfying response what could have caused it. I don't think it was a physical damage.I am still awaiting a visit from Sony Tech to give me the reason for this damage which I suspect is due to temperature causing outer panel brittle polymer to crack due to induced stresses.Lesson Learnt: Buy the 3-5 year extended warranty for all new modern electronics."
5,Excellent TV,"I bought the Sony 40V3000 after reviewing Consumer Reports. I previously had a Sharp Aquos and was very happy with it, but wanted to get a Sony. The TV will not disappoint. Excellent picture, very intuitive controls. I like the LCD picture and prefer it to Plasma and DLP. Highly recommend this TV."
4,very pleased,My partner was very pleased with his present. Great set up and no hassles to delivery or any other problems.
3,The truth about this TV,"Pros: The picture quality is excellent-- detailed image, excellent color, great contrast, matte screen (unlike Samsung) means lights/reflections in room are no problem... Sounds good so far, right? Unfortunately...Cons: When there is a lot of motion on this TV, the action is really blurry, especially in darker scenes, which is very, very distracting. Whether its when the camera is panning, or just when objects on the screen are moving, all of the detail is lost in a blur. It looks like the screen doesn't refresh fast enough. Brighter outdoor scenes perform much better, but in the long run, I wish that I'd waited another year or so to dip into HDTV as things like this just haven't been worked out yet unless you go with a DLP TV instead of LCD, which is still a bit too new for me to spend money on either.."
2,Spoiled by the set!!,"Based on other reviews I had high expectations for this but the production was spoiled for me by the use of a bright, white screen as a background for almost the entire production! Visually, I couldn't get past the glaring white set! The cast, singing, dance, and costumes were excellent. But I couldn't get past the background!"
5,MUST HAVE FOR ALL BSB FANS,I thought this video totally kicked butt. I am a skeptic about unauthorized tapes like this but I thought this tape was worth the money. Nick looks so young and it has alot of rare footage. It is unauthorized so there's no music but the footage makes up for it.
1,ONE WORD- STINKS!,"so i'm glad i own this thing because it DOES have about 15 minutes of clips of the guys when they were jsut starting out, yknow, NICK, was like 13, all the guys are still in school practically. but the entire video is LOU PERLMAN talking about how he MADE them. That's about it. just DO NOT BUY IT! you can HAVE MINE! well not really, but just dont."
2,Not That Great,"This video I only bought because I'm a huge fan of the Backstreet Boys. This vid is totally non-Backstreet with a whole lot of interviews just their back-up band talking about them. The only good thing on this is about 15 minutes of the guys when they were (really) young, like Nick was about 13! CUTE!!! And another (good) bit was when Nick kissed the camera!"
4,Fascinating Learning Experience,This book was one that I could not put down. It was depressing and intriguing at the same time. It reminded me of a soap opera almost due to all the different characters and their entanglment with each other. Adrian Nicole Leblanc did a great job. Read this book if you'd like a taste of what growing up in the Bronx is like.
5,Fantastic Read,"This is one of those books that once you start you cant put it down. I grew up in Bushwick,( Brooklyn--New York ) and I could relate to many, ALL, of the characters in the book. Infact I can relate so much that at times I got very angry for the mistakes they were making with there lives. Very good read, the Author did her homework and then some. Very well written and I had to pass this book along so that others could read it and maybe learn something."
5,PAGE TURNER,"For me this book was so real, and the characters moved me so much, I wished so much to read more! It almost left me hanging and thinking about their future!"
5,Realism at it's best....,"I read Random Family and found it to be a one of the most gripping accounts of inner city life that I've ever read. I am glad Ms. LeBlanc gave a ""suburban reader"" like myself the opportunity to see the vicous cycle of poverty and drugs and how it affects the youth of today. Another reveiwer wrote, ""She is giving certain right wing factions all the evidence they need to be convinced that they are justified to terminate parental rights, throw people in jail, and force sterilizations. Please, Adrian, remember how ruthless our president is and don't spread these stories.' I disagree with this. We shouldn't hide stories like this. There should be more of these true accounts written. I'm glad she wrote this book. How lawmakers perceive it is their problem. I choose to see this book as one that shows our lawmakers that we have a long hard road ahead of us, in our aim to eradicate poverty from the ghetto. I hope she updates us on Coco and Jessica within the next year."
3,Poverty Porn,"This book sometimes feels like you are reading some kind of bizarre poverty porn. My sophomore college professor recommended that I read it some years ago-she was a documentary photographer. My only concern with it is that it isn't all that interesting in a broad sense-Puerto Ricans in the inner ghetto being gangsters and poor-WOW, how unimaginative!!!! But I guess if you want a portrait of a messed up family and enjoy the voyeurism of early 90s inner city family dysfunction this is your book! She picked the equivalent for white people on Jerry Springer, people with zero common sense, and wrote what felt like an extended NYT magazine article of gangster porn."
1,why do professional reviewers like this one so much?,"I couldn't wait to get my hands on this book. Anna Quindlen raved about it months before its publication. Other reviewers gave it glowing reviews. So when I began this book and found it boring and dull and monotonous, I wondered what was wrong with me! This book was a terrible disappointment--there's nothing in it but a recitation of daily goings-on among the various mostly unappealing residents of one Bronx neighborhood. There's no insight from the author and nothing to pull the book together. I do not recommend this one whatsoever."
3,FYI: This review is superficial...,"I'm a Takeshi Kaneshiro fan, so naturally he's my favorite part of this movie. He's easily got to be one of the most beautiful men in the entire world. A negative aspect about this film that I have to address is the female lead he gets involved with. Her character is so annoying, all over him all the time. For those of you who think that's just my jealousy talking, I'll have you know that I'm ok with some of his other on-screen relationships. Anyway, my fondness for him led to my watching this movie (and enjoying his performance as always), but my dislike of her will keep me from watching it again."
1,this does not have j hook and bolt.,"It does not have J-hook and bolt. Without it, I can't hold down the battery. I have to buy the hook separately. I called the manufacturing company and they told me that if I buy this it will have everything I need to hold down a battery, but it didn't. I feel deceived and stupid."
4,"Very good, but I was looking for more variety","I enjoyed this DVD, for the most part. Miranda really helps you to stretch your body. My body felt really good after doing these stretches. However, I noticed a lot of repeat stretches between the Full Body Workout and the Athletes Intense Stretch, I was hoping for more variety. Other than that the scenery was nice. I preferred the ocean scenery in Full Body Workout to the pool and garden in Athletes Intense Stretch. Miranda is very peaceful to watch and gives some very good pointers on stretching, such as ""Stretching is suppose to feel good. If you start hurting stop."" She does have conversation with you throughout both workouts, which I find relaxing. Some people don't like this, but I do, the workout goes by better for me than in complete or almost complete silence."
2,Not Great,"Although I generally love Beverly Barton, there have been a couple of her books that have lacked her normal luster. This wasnt that bad per se but honestly, the main female lead, Lindsey McAllister, killed me. Im not one to dislike the weaker female leads but this was ridiculous. The girl had not one ounce of integrity or self respect and for the first time in any romantic book I have ever read I found myself wishing she would leave him. Who could stand it. I actually liked Judd more than I like her. However the story itself was good. Worth the read if youve got nothing else but I cant say I wasnt disappointed."
3,Useless hero,"The killer and suspense part of the book was interesting. I'm not a fan of some of the killing scenes because it was a bit gruesome at times. I like the h. She was a pretty smart and tough character. Her only weakness was the hero. I have no idea why she was so in love with him. He was a jerk to her for most of book. I understand that he was grieving over his dead wife but that was 4 years ago. He moped around for way too long. He didn't do anything to help solve the serial killer case because he was too busy moping. The h and her boss were the ones that did all the work while the H sat back and felt sorry for himself. He is definitely not the ""save the day"" kind hero. IMO he was a useless hero. The book could have gone on without him. If you read this book for the mystery and suspense it's pretty good. If you read it for the romance you'll be disappointed."
2,"Good product, terrible shipping and condition",I ordered this for my wife for Christmas and recieved it very quickly. I guess for the price there is not much to complain about but the item was not in it's factory packaging although it was included in the shipping box. As a result it is marred and scratched up pretty badly and on of the mounting screws is missing. I almost looks as if it had been installed and removed.
1,this thing sucks,this thing broke in the the first time i used it the parts just fall right out of thhe lighter and the parts are very flimsey so if you try to fix i the parts just break i do not think this was a good buy on my part
2,not all that happy,the product in the picture looks like a cigarette but was actually a lighter which is why i ordered itthe product i received on the other hand was a good lighter that didnt really look convincing as a cigarette at allit was too thick and didnt even light the same way that the one in the picture did so i was pretty upseti mean it did light so two stars but i could have bought a lighter anywhere but i liked the cigarette lighter for irony and illusion and both were ruined by this joke of a product
2,it broke,It came with fluid inside and worked great until I tried to refill it with butane and it fell apart in my hands.I really liked it though
2,Didn't last long...,Looks like a common quality problem as reported by others too... its my 2nd backboard didn't last over a year... Can't afford time/money to replace it... may use plywood between the panels to fix it!
1,don't waste your money,"I have owned this less than two years and the acrylic is shattering to pieces.My family is not sport oriented but wanted to give the kids something to learn to dribble and shoot on. My oldest (11yrs old) was trying to make a three pointer and hit the upper left corner and chunks came falling down.The acrylic is only 1/16"" thick, so it's designed to break. Frame and rim are good though. May slap some plywood on the frame and call it good."
5,Works as advertised,"Pretty simple to use and set up. It's a life saver when you have to make really quick patch changes while you're playing. The battery lasts about 24 hours, which isn't bad, but like many other reviewers, I wish it had a power supply."
1,IT WAS HORRIBLE!!!,"I think that *n the mix is the best nsnyc tape--because it's offical..NEVER Buy an tape that isnt official because it doesn't have nsync talking to the camera on it! i thought this tape would be great cause i could never get enough of nsync! but its not even with nsync! it asks people ""who are your favorite nsyncer and why"" the answer was 100% of the time ""justin cause he's cute"" i know that already! why do u need to know it frum every fan..has no information on NSYNC! DONT BUY! WASTE OF MONEY"
1,"Trust me save your money, pass this one up.","Save your money for cool releases like 'N the Mix and the new Video and CD this fall. The Official releases of 'N SYNC feature why fans like myself love this group: THE FIVE GUYS and THEIR MUSIC. This video lured me in with ""Never Enough"" but I wish I drew the line and passed this up. There were only a few fuzzy pictures of the guys and fans repeating: ""My favorite song is...My favorite guy is...I like them better than..."" I know why I like them. Where are the videos, pictures, stories, or something to make this tape worth my money and time?"
1,DON'T BUY,Don't buy this. It does not have NSYNC in it. It is misleading and boring. It is some reporter but only a couple pics of NSYNC. No real footage of the guys.
1,Don't waste your money,"This video shows no footage of the guys. It is a total waste of money. Do not buy it. If you really want to see it, rent it fron the library or video store."
1,Please Listen- Don't Buy It,"This movie only showed a lady asking stupid questions. Then it barely shows any 'N SYNC. It was terrible. Save your money for like a poster, or a rare CD. This is worse than home ec movies at my school. Please don't buy it, I'm telling you."
1,Horrible video! total waste of my money!,"This video was so horrible. All it had was this dumb lady walking around a parking lot asking 5 year old girls who their favorite Nsync member was and what their favorite song was. Unless you feel like hearing 5 year olds say ""Justin is hot"" and ""My favorite song is God Must Have Spent A Little More Time WITH You"" then don't buy this video and make this dumb lady who made it rich!"
1,A total waste of money!,I bought never enough and I thought *N Sync would be in it but they weren't. I hated it. I watched the movie with a grin on my face. So if your are looking to buy this movie don't. I LOVE *N SYNC SOOOO MUCH and this movie stunk! So just take my advice and don't buy the movie!!!
4,These flippers have served me well,"I'm not sure how to compare these flippers to other flippers, but I have no complaints with these. They have served me well, and provide me good locomotion when under water.They do seem a bit heavy."
5,Pleased with my purchase,I recently got this phone after a friend told me that he was getting 5-7 days in between charges. It is absolutely true. I have only had to charge it about every 5-6 days with moderate use. The phone is a good basic phone that works well so far and feel good and sturdy. So far so good.
5,The handbook for those of us with ageing parents,"This is exactly the type of book you need to read if you have older parents. It's a checklist that will prevent you and them from overlooking potential disasters. It is concise and to the point. It will give you knowledge when dealing with the inevitable matters of ageing and the ""professionals"" you meet such as health care workers and insurance agents. Invaluable.Honestly I can't understand what the first reviewer was talking about. This is a good book!"

3,Should have come with the scanner,"An accessory like this really should come with the scanner, especially prosumer gear like the Nikon CoolScan V ED for which I purchased this film strip holder. As an extra-cost accessory, something this rudimentary and flimsy should be priced at $5, not the $25 that I paid for it."
5,great addition,This item is easy toinstall and a great benefit . I really like it the only problem is deciding which color to use. I am using the clear and I love it.
3,Not the only CD with heavy breathing noises...,"Wonderful music by Gabriel Faure (better known for his divine Requiem), great virtuosity by Shaham of course, but (!) do we have to put up with the heavy breathing noises? And this is not the only CD where the breathing is too distracting to enjoy the music, unfortunately! 5 stars for the beautiful romantic music, 5 stars for Shaham's playing, 0 stars for the irritating and distracting noises... Pity."
5,"This DVD Shows Kauai The Way I Remember It. Gorgeous Scenery! The real ""feel"" of being there.","I bought several DVDs of Kauai after visiting there. Somehow I got distracted and viewed all of them but this one. Today I put it in the machine to use as a background while I was reading. I selected the music, not the narration, and the music was very pleasant and nondistracting. However, once I glanced at the television screen, I put the book aside and watched the whole thing.It was exactly the way I remember Kauai! The lush scenery, the wonderful beaches, one after another, the way we saw them as we explored the island. I was delighted! If you are planning a trip to Kauai, or if you've been there or only want to look at some beautiful scenery, this is a wonderful DVD. I recommend it."
4,Good Set... They're really big though,"The pictures make this product look smaller than they are. They seem to be good quality, just bigger than I thought they would be."
3,cough smokey cough,These are very smoky sticks.. more chemical in flavor than food-like. Nine more words are required so here are more words. yay
3,They were tough,I love jerky and this was good but a little too smokey for my liking. They were too bite into and extremely salty... I love saltiness in jerky but this was too overwhelming for my taste.
2,Not worth it,"There was indeed a lot of smokey flavor, which I like, but the taste was much too salty. I will not ever buy again. Very disappointed."
2,Not up to the usual standard,"I'm a huge fan of the Mrs. Murphy series; they're my favourites of all the cat/crime genre. Unfortunately, the latest volume doesn't come up to the standard set forth in the series so far. It reads like a rough draft turned in under a deadline. While the actual premise is interesting enough, it's both unoriginal and so far-fetched that it's hard for this ordinary person to care about it. The writing is wooden and stilted, more a recitation of events than a good story. The new characters are lifeless -- not even a budding romance has any real zing -- and the old characters are predictable. Nothing new is happening in the town of Crozet; let's eat some orange glazed cinnamon buns. Even the animals can't really save this one; they talk a lot but don't really contribute much. A fan of the series will want to read _Catch as Cat Can_, but get it out of the library."
3,not as good as the rest,"As much as I love Brown's writing style, this book went from bad to worse. Very scattered.Still love the people in her books though."
3,Not nearly as good as the others,"I love this series and eagerly await her books. I love Rita Mae's style of writing and her wit. However, I had the devil's own time getting into this book. It did read like a rough draft. As a writer myself, I felt reading her book as I do when I am bored or in a slump in my own writing and am just trying to fill pages and/or time. Not very satisfying. Still, not really bad, either. Rita Mae is too good to be totally disappointing, but definitely not a winner in this series."
4,"""I don't wanna lose ya!""","This song is something that everybody can dance too...it's so crazy! It's like James Brown on speed! It's not house or techno, but straight-ahead crazy-up-tempo funk. Too bad it's not available domestically...anyone can go crazy to this song."
5,Good news for UK Tick fans.,"The Tick does not have a very high profile over here in the U.K, the cartoon series was only sporadically broadcast on BBC2 some years back, but never in a regular time slot.The comics are only available via specialist comic shops, I personally have never read one.Having bought other region 1 discs from Amazon, the Tick DVD was brought to my attention in a personal mailing. I was previously unaware of the live action series, so big thanks to Amazon for bringing it to my attention.It's great, I echo every positive comment that has already been made on this forum.The main reason I am submitting a review though, is to point out to other U.K. residents who may be contemplating buying this disc, that the DVD is actually region free! This means it will play on any player, whether it is multi-region or not. So, if you don't own a multi-region or 'chipped' player you will still be able to appreciate the brilliance of this TV series.Please God, let the big-screen version happen!"
1,"Oh, *that* one...","I was so excited! The Tick on DVD! But......it's not the cartoon......back to downloading one-inch-square MPEG bootlegs of the original, the one, the only, cartoon Tick.(Spoon.)"
1,Terrible,"Sorry to say..But this series was terrible, a real insult to the cartoon. Anyone who rates this more than one star has a terrible sense of humor like this series..YUCK.."
5,They should have done more episodes.,"I really like ""The Tick"" in all its glory. This DvD is a must have for fans of the Tick cartoon and/or corny superhero fans."
4,Seasons 2 & 3 would have been amazing,"Many shows are cancelled in the first season because they stink. It is widely believed - by many including me - that this one was cancelled because the people making the decision would not have recognized genius if it walked up and punched them in the face. The casting and acting were fantastic. Warburton was made for this role. Arthur was perfect, and the few episodes were well written, and managed to attract great guest stars and character actors. I can't help but be disappointed that I never got a chance to see what would have happened with this caste if they had been given an opportunity to run with this show for a few seasons."
3,Where's the ANIMATED SERIES on DVD????,"This is silly, fun stuff but if you want to really laugh you need to see the original Saturday morning cartoon. That means they need to RELEASE the animated series on DVD for you to do that so I'm lobbying now here for the ANIMATED SERIES! It was definately funnier and more twisted. LET'S GET ON IT GUYS! HOW ABOUT THE ANIMATED TICK PLEASE???! Thanx!"
3,Interesting - but lacking legs,"The Tick is a bit of a one joke show - the big dumb superhero that doesn't understand the world around him. I'm glad I bought it, but I can see why it got cancelled - there is nowhere obvious for the story to go. I seem to be collecting cancelled animal themed American TV series: Firefly and Greg the Bunny - both of which I'd rate above the Tick"
3,Needed better writers,"Patrick Warburton was fantastic as the Tick. I don't think they could have found anyone better.The episodes, few as they were, were overall OK. I little heavy on the sex humor, but then, if you want a kid version of the Tick, get the cartoon.I also liked Captain Liberty and Batmanuel. Great supporting characters.What really brought the show down, though, was Arthur. His character in this is filled with resentment, is highly critical of the Tick in almost all things, and his general bitterness just brought the whole show down. I'd rather he had been portrayed as he had been in the comics - someone who looked up to the Tick, while (being the more lucid one) steering him in the right direction. Instead, in this series, he was always belittling the Tick, and that is what, in my opinion, brought the series down.Still, overall, worth the $12 I spent on it."
5,an amazing comic made into an amazing show,"I was a fan of The Tick comic books ( all, what, 13 of them?) and they are amongst my most prized posessions. I was very nervous when I heard a live action show was being made of the The Tick. However, I absolutely loved the show and the DVD set. I've already watched them through three times. A great buy!"
4,"Cartoons now, please","While the live action tv show was not the worse thing ever, I find myself hoping that the execs in charge will find it in them to release the cartoon series on DVD as well. Spoon!"
3,I wanna be SPOON-fed!,"I'm feeling blue. Where, oh, where is the justice? Ain't no justice. Not BLUE JUSTICE. Real Tick fans from Edlund's black & white ishes early on can relate, n'est-ce pas? The Warburton show started weak and finished strong, from a writing POV, dumbed-down versions of Die Fledermaus & American Maid notwithstanding. But it was ill-promoted. and we are left without Chairface Chippendale, Barry Hubris & the best rogue's gallery of goofball highbrow villainy ever to grace the cathode ray set. Left without TV's first celebrity capybara. Left without the answer to what would happen if Captain Mucilage fought Mucus Tick? Left without that groovy theme song, BA-DAH-BOW! And left without a Townsend Coleman fix...fella! So he sez to me, he sez ""you got style baby, but if you gonna be a real DVD bestseller instead of one what bombs at Christmas, you gotta dish the REAL goods, man."" I mean...Murdoch, do you, like, read, man?"
5,Why oh why was this show cancelled?,"It's a crime that only 9 episodes of this amazing, hilarious show exist."
2,Contact Disney!,"In a ""real"" perfect world, this TV series would have never been created and the cartoon would be released on DVD.For Tick fans interested in seeing a collection of the cartoon series released, note that Disney currently owns property rights to the series. Please contact them to make your voice heard."
2,Not as good as the first book,"I bought my copy of this sequel to ""A Thousand Words for Stranger"" as soon as it was available on Amazon.com because the first book was so excellent (and, incidentally, Czerneda's other book, ""Beholder's Eye"" was even better). However I have not been able to plow my way through this one; it just doesn't scintillate the way the two earlier books do. The Drapski (alien race) are really well done and demonstrate Czerneda's knowledge of biology and evolution, but her two main characters, Sira and Morgan, just don't click the way they did before. My advice is, if you haven't read any Czerneda yet, start with the first books and skip this one. And let's hope she does write a sequel to ""Beholder's Eye."""
3,Average...Sorry!,"The video was a good capture of the band in concert, but the group didn't seem to have a lot of positive energy working together on the show. The video is average with weird camera angles...sorry not into that; but the music is great!"
1,Sinbad hated this book.,This cliche revisitation to Harry Potter made me bleed from my eyes when I read it.
1,Panasonic VCR head cleaner,"We were disappointed with Panasonic's product. It is inferior to other brands. We've found the best to be the Maxell cleaner, but I'm not sure it is still in production."
5,Extraordinary,"Jason Vieaux is a brilliant young guitarist who transcends mere technical proficiency and plays with a passion and flair that belie his age. Albeniz' music, originally written for piano, assumes a haunting lyricism when performed on guitar. True to its flamenco inspired roots, it also displays the intricate rhythms and flourishes one would expect. Vieaux's sensitivity and talent are particularly well suited to its challenges.This is a must-have recording for all fans of Spanish guitar music."
3,Adequate performer,"I bought this product for listening to the Today show while I walk in the morning. The reception has been disappointing. I've also found it difficult to set the presets. Otherwise, given that I haven't been able to find any other tv 'walkman' products, this product is adequate."
2,"Dancing nice, Women nice, rest, not so much","The tag line on this film is 'Amazon princess travels to LA to save the rainforest by dancing the lambada'. That seems pretty silly, and, really, the dancing is about all that is to this movie. The dancers are nice-looking, the dancing is certainly sexy, and the production is well-staged and the dancing well choreographed. The plot is silly, with the hero's sprained ankle a major plot point.However, it is true that the rainforest in Brazil is rapidly being plowed under, to feed the increasing human population on the planet, to the detriment of us all."
4,Cheesy & Enjoyable,"I love this movie; it's a cult classic for me. The dancing is great, the plot has some issues, some of the acting is bad, but for the escapism factor it's an enjoyable ride. It has also has a theme that is still relevant today: the environment. Laura Herring's character is an indigenous princess from the Amazon rainforest that comes to the USA to try to stop the American company that is deforesting the Amazon -- still a problem today."
4,Works as advertised,The adapter does what you need it to do - convert your bike rack to a ski rack. Overall it is built well and was easy to install. I am a little concerned that part of the mounting hardware is plasic. Time will tell if that is actually a problem. I have logged several hundred miles of use so far without issue.
5,The book of all books,"I had been looking for a book about creativity, I wanted to understand the process more, and hopefully increase my productivity. This book was one of 12 that I bought related to the design and creativity area, and was by far the best I've read yet. It gives so much information about the process of idea generation that even I understand it more now (and I've been doing it for 4 years). I have already used the advice on handling clients to great success, and I'm reading the book a second time round.This book is a MUST for all designers at all levels!!Enjoy"
4,Great Read,I'm so glad my professor made this a required textbook! Mark Oldach's insights into the process of concept development are so helpful. This should be in the graphic designer's library. I will return to this book again and again!
1,Hanson A-Square,"Both items, the 1st and then this one, came in damaged. It was purchased as a gift and I thought they had been sent back but I came to find out that there was a breakdown in communications.The packaging was terrible and as I said before both the squares were damaged and unusable upon arrival.Therefore due to the condition of the items I am unable to submit a review."
5,Hanson Square,"Extremely handy product Lays out perfect square sides for forming, tile laying etc. I recommend it for any project that needs to be perfectly square. Also, I recommend getting a short section of 3 inch PVC and two caps to keep the square inside of if you place it in a tool box."
5,Success at Last,I never could get a perfect 90 degree angle on my table saw sliding table until I used the 345 EK. I took me about one minute to get it right.
1,I noticed no effect from using this supplement,"Figured I'd try DL-Phenylalanine since I was feeling a bit lethargic and this product is supposed to ""support an alert state"" as well as reduce pain and help with memory. Well, I felt none of these benefits. I think taking vitamins B12 or a B complex are actually better, add a cup of coffee and you're good to go."
5,great Product fast shipping.,"Worked wonderfully. my camera was fuzzy, I couldn't find anything in wal-mart and live no where near a best buy or anything like that. It was much cheaper here than going to best buy or anywhere else also."
1,Mars Snacks,"Tim Burton strikes out again in this inflated rip off of 1950's B Budget films that were actually quite more enjoyable and inventive. This is the shortcoming of Hollywood when a mediocre director gets a ton a money, desirable actors, and does nothing with it except give us cool looking, mischievous aliens that were theived from bubble gum cards. This is an agony to watch because nothing ever happens except a weird 'buzzing' sound that is actually a Theremin machine that was used in the classic sci-fi tradition. You are better served by watching 'War of the Worlds' for the 10th time again. Leave this stinker in the can."
1,A good movie to fall asleep to,Ive only found a few good movies to fall asleep to...Aligator and this. This movie was a real letdown as it was suppose to be a comody...didnt even make me smirk. Yawwwnnnnn.
4,Subtle,"It's amazing that there could be anything subtle in a movie about martians bent on destroying the world with death ray guns, but behind the wackiness and campy violence lies humor that reveals itself with repeated viewings."
5,Whacked out fun!,"My 12yr.year old daughter and I really enjoy Mars Attacks! Its really alot of fun and very funny!hilarious sight gags,the expressions of the martians,the way they say""Mep!Mep!Mep!"" just cracks us ups + all the cool cameos throughout the movie are great!The movie is based on the old ""Mars Attacks!"" comic series which I had not been familiar with,but its right up my alley with its cool graphics,which were attacked themselves because of their violence in their time.Its a ""must have"" for our family collection.Give it a whirl!"
3,Something is Missing,"This spoof of the alien invasion, sci-fi movies has a great cast and the right idea, but something is missing. I think it comes up a little short in the humor department with its rather predictable situations and jokes. It could use a bit more imagination and artisticism, because it looks quite a bit like the stuff it is trying to spoof."
2,maybe good for 5 year old kids,"O.k. it is supposed to make fun of 'Independence day' but wasn't 'I.d.' enough? The cast can't save it and neither can the special effects. Two stars for the production, which could have been better allocated to a different movie."
1,mars attacks,well a movie with no sound.. not good its was a copy that didnt turn out well.what more can be said
1,Mars Attacks and is dumb and stupid,This is a dumb unfunny movie. It involves a martian invasion of Earth. I don't know who this is targeted at. It is not a serious action movie. It is a comedy if you are a sicko and find people getting killed funny. If you want to see a good alien invasion movie see Independence day. This only deserves one star because Natalie Portman is in it and see is so hot.
1,Terrible Film,"There are so many reasons why I hate this movie. However, the thing that really bugged me was how they attached the woman's head to a dog, that was really messed up."
2,Yuck! Phooey!,"What a bizarre and campy sci-fi scare flick with some real morbidity thrown in! So do you think I would really find humor in victims getting slowly turned into brightly colored skeletons by those hideous invaders with their death rays and their families ended up bawling at their funeral - even if they happen to be trailer-dwelling rednecks??? And think severed fingers, hands, and heads are really funny at all? One amusing moment, however is when some big-wigged bimbo goes prancing into some guy's house to seduce him with a few grisly scenes thrown in. Not to worry, though - such ugly creatures with those bulging eyeballs and pulsating brains eventually get just their desserts after a whole reign of inducing death and terror on the poor innocent humans, however cartoon-like they may be. A real wacko circus show for the sci-fi ape, nevertheless!"
3,"""Mars attacks"" movie","We saw part of this at a restaurant bar and thought it would be fun to see. It is a spoof on ""independence Day"". Funny, but just okay. I think teeneagers would like it best."
4,Pretty funny but not a classic,"Wow! This certainly isn't a five star movie, but I don't understand all the one star reviews either. It is VERY camp and VERY silly. Maybe the one star people wanted Independence Day and got silly instead. Tim Burton has made much better movies, e. g. Betelgeuse. In fact this may be his least successful movie so far, but is nevertheless clever and interesting to watch. Yes, all the characters are stereotypes and most of them would have been familiar to '50s audiences. The aliens, however, are having a great '90s kind of time reassuring people that they come in peace as they gleefully commit mayhem. If you want something light and silly to relax with I recommend this one."
1,Silent film,Sound track had music on it but not the actors voices. Must have been recorded wrong. Second shipped copy had the same problem.
3,All star cast keeps the laughs going,"Mars is a classic comedy that I hadn't see in a long time that doesn't have the best script, but it's witty and funny in spots. The special effects are typical of that time and a little cheesy, but it's still an enjoyable movie."
2,"Fab film, bare bones + lackluster transfer blu ray = don't bother","It's old hat that Warner weren't keen on Mars Attacks! however I had hoped a change within the company would have resulted in a darn site more respect being bestowed upon its blu ray release. None of the extras from the dvd are carried over, and the transfer is another of Warner's (hello Eraser!) dull, noise/grain reduced and thus lacking that HD quality pop releases. Fine detail is seriously lacking, so much so, there's nowhere near the step up from sd-dvd it should have been.Save your hard earned, it's not worth buying.Warner please get your finger out and rerelease this as a special edition with a restored transfer."
3,Its just Okay,This was supposed to be a tribute to old B movies but it just feels like they tried too hard. There are a few funny parts but the movie but they don't make the movie too memorable.
1,Wow. What a waste of celluloid.,"I suppose it happens to most directors; they get too big for their britches, the moron studio heads agree to let them make their pet project about whatever obsessive nostalgic interest they have in times past (and times that should have been left for dead), and absolute dreck is born. I get campy movies and humor, I like bizarre/dry/oddball humor. There isn't any of that to be found here, so I'm really not sure what's there to commend the movie. My answer: nothing."
4,Boys On the Rocks,Interestingly written. Captures the emotional and thought flow of a gay male teen. The first crush is always the hardest to go through and end. Too bad the author died before he could write another. AIDS epidemic certainly silenced a lot of gay voices.
2,not a very good instructional tape,"This tape is 50 minutes long, but it has only 10 minutes of useful information on how to improve your skills. Compare to ""skiing made easy "" tapes it is much worse."
1,A plethora of ignorance and misinformation,Which comes from a guy who's a proven liar (see his other works and read up on them at Answers in Action.)
1,Repented?,"Everyone gets the chance to repent, we can't doubt that. But if Warnke has repented, why does he continue to spread his lies? Warnke continues to perform a disservice to the whole of humanity and to the great religion to whom he grants little more than lip-service. A book that more properly gives born-again Christians reason to stand tall is ""Selling Satan,"" the investigation of Warnke that showed us all what he really is, written by a pair of born-again Christian investigators. I gladly await any sign that Warnke shall abandon this twisted path and turn to better things, but if such a sign is forthcoming, this book isn't it."
4,Bargain,"I bought this book for Shawshank, and I have enjoyed the other short stories immensely! Great Bargain. Quality books all - in - one package. Shawshank is my Favorite movie of all time, and the book did not disappoint."
4,""" A vivid view of prison life""","After reading 85 novels, I finally read a Stephen King story. My friend who encouraged me to start reading had been after me to read him for awhile. I am really glad that I did. He is a great story teller and kept me in the story even when I wasn't reading it. As I have said before, a good writer is someone who can paint a vivid picture in the reader's mind's eye. This is done here in painting a picture of life in Shawshank Prison, Maine. This a great story of one man's strength to survive against all odds; we can all learn from this. It certainly should be told to all those who would think of breaking the law."
3,so so study guide,"The study guide overall was pretty good. However, the typos in the math section were very frustrating. Some of them were way off. Whoever proofread this thing needs to be shot. The practice tests were harder than the actual CBEST exam, which is nice. I would recommend this as a secondary study guide and to use Cracking the CBEST as your primary study guide since it is a lot more helpful and has virtually no typos."
1,Don't waste your money,"This book makes me so mad that I don't know whether to burn it or take it back so Kaplan loses out on my money. There are typographical and format errors all over the place, explanations are vague, the math section is needlessly excessive and overly extensive, and the reading section is grossly lacking. I consistently scored around a 35 on the reading sections, but vehemently disagree with about half of those missed points because the poor wording of the question, the vague answer choices, or the faulty reasoning of the answer explanations. This book is full of contradictions and errors. I passed the CBEST, but with no help from this book. There is another reviewer of this book that says to go to the CBEST website and review there, and I agree wholeheartedly. The practice test on their website is much more indicative of questions you will encounter on your test, and it is free. Whatever you do, don't buy this book. It's a waste of your time and money."
1,Stay away from Kaplan CBEST Study Guide,"After studying this guide I became more and more discouraged and then started really worrying if I could pass the test. I started wondering about the idiots who created such a ridiculous test. The reading questions are bizarre and often had no good answer, especially with respect to word definitions. The math section tests on things that were never explained and has some distortions of problems that took me 15 minutes just to figure out the solution explanation. If you want to build your confidence stay away from this book. After studying it I went to the CBEST webpage and found out the testers weren't crazy, it was Kaplan"
3,"good oscar, mediocre clark",Oscar was great but too much Clark Terry!! Clark is good but I bought the cd to hear Oscar play..
1,THIS BOOK SUCKS,DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK!! TYLER HICKS IS NOT HERE TO HELP YOU AS HE CLAIMS IN THE BOOK. HES IS HOWEVER LOOKING TO GET PEOPLE TO SUBSCRIBE TO HIS NEWSLETTERS AND BUY HIS OTHER BOOKS AND KITS HE SELLS. THE INFORMATION IN HIS BOOK IS VERY VERY GENERAL. MOST OF THE INFORMATION IN THE BOOK IS STUFF PEOPLE ALLREADY KNOW. HIS POTENTIAL EARNINGS EST. WERE ALL INFLATED.
1,Has A Great Title,"If only the author stuck to what he proposed he would deliver, this would have been a great book... all a reader is expecting to get is practical mail order businesses they can start. The estimated profits to be made from some of the ideas are just too impractical, and yes ridiculous! You can tell he is just guessing his way to the end of this book."
4,Not Just A Cookbook,"Carol Field's Celebrating Italy is as much an Italian cultural reference book as it is a cookbook. I loved reading through all the different holidays celebrated in Italy complete with traditional recipes. Having lived in Italy for 8 years myself, Carol's stories made me long for a return trip.. Being the Italian Cooking Host @ Bella Online I found the recipes true to their cultural origins, but yet given with clear, easy to follow directions. If you are as fascinated with Italian cuisine as I am, you'll love this book!"
5,An Amazing Soundtrack!!!,"As I watched ""Lost In Translation,"" I couldn't help but notice how well the background music went so well with each scene. During many scenes, I swore I was listening to My Bloody Valentine, but I thought there was no way a Hollywood movie director would ever choose one of MBV's tracks as background music. Much to my suprise I was wrong, and the accompanying soundtrack not only features a MBV classic track, but 4 new songs crafted by the group's leader Kevin Shields. The music has a hazy, fuzzy quality to it that matches the feel of the movie perfectly. This is as close as MBV fans will get of what once was."
4,curiousaboutthemusic,"Everyone seems to be very generous in sharing their knowledge of the music in the movie (that is not necessarily on the soundtrack) and I wanted to inquire as to the little snippet that is heard as Bill Murray is standing outside the Orange Club (the strip club). It was a very energetic bit of electronica that sounded delicious. Anybody got any idea?P.S. as much as I enjoyed the karaoke music in the movie I think the omission of it in the soundtrack was a good move. My overall sensation during the movie was that of floating in a blissful cloud, a keen observer of a strange, fascinating and mysterious place. The soundtrack supports that theme and mood."
4,Good show,"This is another one of WWE's lower tier shows, but still delievered. I bought this to add to my collection and I would recommend it."
1,Broke the 1st time using it,"Avoid this product. The clip that holds the mounting plate to broke, rendering the whole unit useless. Could not get any support from the manufacturer and it was past the return period for Amazon."
4,An amazing story - decently told,This is the story of one British Marine and his path from signing up to the fall of Rangoon to walking back to India and eventually returning to England.What this guy acomplished is amazing. And it also gives a front row picture of the confusion as England tried to stop the Japanese early on.The book is well written (not superb). It's the actual story that moves this up to 4 stars from 3. It's was written during the war and the style shows. But it is pretty honest for that period of time.I'm glad I read it.
3,Could have been a little better,"As some of my ancestors are in this book; I did look forward to reading it. There are good genealogy authors and not so good. This particular book was sloppy when citing 'circa' dates of birth, deaths & marriages. The authors should have used Elizabeth Shown Mills' ""Cite Your Sources,"" and her later work ""Evidence! Citation & Analysis for the Family Historian."" Because of this faults, some of the items will need to be re-verified."
5,There is no area of this film which is not totally excellant,This should have been marketed as an adult film entitled 'A night for magic' rather than a cartoon in a 'pink' jacket. My only regret is not having it in DVD.
3,Cute...,"This was a nice movie. It is BASED on a true story but it doesn't really follow what truly happened, mind you. In real life two girls photographed each other posing behind paper cutouts of fairies. They fooled the world for decades. In the movie, however, the fairies are real. There's something that's just so magical about this movie, I can't describe it. There isn't much storyline, it's just two cousins trying to prove that fairies exist. The computer animation is really good. If you like movies about young children from World War II such as The Secret Garden and A Little Princess, this is for you!!"
2,To Bad,"I am very sorry to say that this is not worth purchasing at all. What makes it very hard is that i love all the cky movies, and i love gnar kill. But this CD Just dousn't compare to such great tracks like ""pantyhose pornshop"" and ""i got erection"". I personally feel the problem is that they tried to go rock with it when previous gnar kill songs was more of a rap. I was very excited when i saw this cd and i was equally dissapointed. So don't buy this album if you loved the previous gnar kill formula and didnt think it needed a change."
4,Better than the Critis have stated.,"I have often read poor reviews for this film ""This Property is Condemned"" and wonder why. It is well acted (although there are some ordinary performances by the support cast) and has a good story line. It is one of my top 100 films and come highly recommended."
5,One of My All Time Favorites!,"I absolutely love this film. It encapsulates so many emotions. I know it was panned by critics and audiences in 1966, but sometimes it takes years to appreciate a film like this. Natalie Wood was brilliant as Alva Starr, a restless teen being sexually exploited by her greedy mother. Mary Badham was fabulous as her happy-go-lucky sister, who is neglected by their mother in favor of Natalie's character, Alva. Robert Redford is great as the railroad representative who changes the town and Alva forever. Charles Bronson is creepy as Alva's mother's boyfriend. The song ""Wish Me A Rainbow"" is featured throughout and is beautiful. Natalie Wood was not even nominated for and Oscar for this, but I think it is one of her finest performances!"
4,moved me to tears,"Must admit that I only knew about this book because I loved the musical since I first saw it on Broadway. I was a bit intimidated by the length of this novel, but it is well worth the read. It moved me to tears, made me re-examine my connection to God, and even made me laugh every now and again!!!!"
5,A Tremendous Story,"This book tells a very powerful story about a group of people struggling to live their lives as best they can. The story is centered on Jean Valjean and the people he meets as he tries to find self-respect.The ending is the most powerful part of the book. I found some of the chapters long and unnecessary, such as the chapter on the Paris sewer system. But over all I really enjoyed and was moved by this bookThis is one of my all time favorite books. I highly recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good solid story that can transport you to another place and time!"
3,rather read it in french,I know that people like to read books in the english language but sometimes its more fun to read it in the language it came from.
3,Les miserables,"Difficult to read, too wordy goes into characters lives too extensively. The translation from French to English,makes reading too difficult to follow."
2,Who translated it????,"I'm assuming this is the Isabel Hapgood translation. It would be nice if you included the name of the translator in both your promotional materials and your e-books. Such details may seem boring and useless to the folks who format e-books, yet they are valuable information for readers, especially those looking for a certain edition. Haven't read it yet, so I cannot comment on the quality of this edition. That's why I'm giving it a tentative 2 stars."
1,Eh...,It was tough to get through the first few pages. The prose didn't seem to read smoothly to me. I may revisit this one though because it is a classic.
2,almost 50 pages in and waiting for the story to start!,"I am amazed at the popularity of the ""Les Mis"" play and movie, because after the 1st 32 pages of character exposition of just one character, I wondered what the hype is about. Then another 10 pages to describe his house. I've never seen the musical, or films, so maybe that's my problem? No wonder the book is so long. Nowadays editors say ""show the readers, don't tell them"" but I guess in Victor Hugo's time you could just tell them, and tell them, and tell them. A gazillion people love the musical so I guess there's a story in there somewhere, about D-------, or M----------, or whatever. I'll keep looking but if I pass 100 pages and still no plot I might just give up."
5,By far the best,"I took a leap on this book, being only 15, for reasons that our marching band this year is playing the music from the musical in our field show. Well...the rendition that he chose for us to listen to was the 10th Anniversary Special, which was missing some songs...so I got the soundtrack...so I'm sad to say I heard the musical first and based my opinions in that way...But I was still confused, so I decided that ""THE BOOK"" was the better option to understand it...i have now FINALLY finished it, and I honestly have to say that out of all the classics (and modern) books I have ever read, it surpasses them to infinity."
5,I adore this book,"And have ever since I was a little girl. Couldn't care less about all the different translations referenced by others - not savvy enough in this area to differentiate, personally. The fact that this version was free only makes it better, thanks!"
2,Unlikable Characters,I pushed my way through this beast and now it's done. Another book checked off the bucket list. I -hated- most of this book. The only interesting characters were Jean val Jean and Eponnie. (I don't even care enough to check the spelling of the character's names.)It goes on and on and on. Hugo forever pontificates on undoubtedly important and interesting subjects -- but he goes on so long and gets so abstract that it renders his points moot.It only gets the second star because of the successful and awesome film and stage adaptations.
2,Poor copy of Les Mis,poor copy of a great classic - - cannot read the type as it is copied so poorlyreally wanted to read it but alas it will sit on my book shelf collecting only dust
3,Tough read,"Having see the stage production & listened to the musical for years, I wanted to read the novel; something I had never done. However, I found it to be very laborious. It is hard to follow and starts slow."
1,Rediculous size paperback,"If I had known this book would have so many pages I would not have ordered. Being as thick as it is makes it very difficult to hold, and the binding edge will be broken before halfway through reading. A size that would cut the page count in half would be helpful, especially to people with small or arthritic hands."
3,A good read,I am re-reading Les Miserables after reading it many years ago and seeing a stage production of it. It is still a good read.
2,le misarable,Le Miserables this book was not as interesting as I thought and was heavy reading and was far too long
3,Ebooks Les Miserables,I am only reading this book at the moment but it is a great advantage to have it on my phone as I can read it at anytime
3,Les Miserables,I loved the I because it wasn't one of the stories you just figure out within the first pages. I didn't like it because I don't really like to cry a lot or sad stories...
3,"Great story, with plenty of chapters to skip","Reading this book was an interesting experience... the entire long first section, in my opinion, should have been about 2 pages long. Throughout the book, it was very much pushing socialism as the great morality, which I personally found exasperating. Also, the history of every building, etc that went on for chapters at a time got very old. You can skip all of that and get to the story without missing anything. The story itself was great, with characters you love to love, and love to hate. It is full of philosophy and history... this is the first book I've ever read that took a positive view of the French revolution."
4,Awesome read!,"Better than the movie. I highly recommend it! Victor Hugo would be proud, I wish I had written it. Who doesn't?"
4,Solid movie,Decent but not great. The actors are very good but at times the storyline could have been followed or clarified better.
1,THE BOOK Les Misberables,Well I honestly didn't like this book because it was quite boring and the only reason I had read it because I had to four school
3,"York, A+; Editor, D","If you ever thought Hey, it must be easy to be an actor, just pay attention to Michael York, who's using only his voice! He keeps separate several characters, male and female, with nuances and accents that we can understand instantly.Pity about this abridgement is that the translation was never edited. There is no distinction between that and which, for instance. ""Which"" is used exclusively.But I'll keep listening to M. York, c'est formidable!"
4,Great book,Just saw the movie and enjoyed that to unbelievable that this was written so long ago and wasa fantastic story.
3,love this story,"But I am having trouble reading this translation, so beware, it requires lots of time and patience to understand the way the English is written ."
3,Not like the movie,"If you think the book is like the play or movie, you are in for a surprise. The first several chapters are all about the priest. I thought it would be about Valjean. Good book, just not what I expected."
1,An incredibly tedious read,"I am sticking this out just to say I actually read the thing, but I am skipping some pages as fast as I can touch them. The main plot is too obfuscated by endless diatribes about the church, the government, the battle at Watterloo, which are only tangentelly related to the main character. All in all, I'd say this classic is quite BORING! Tale of Two Cities and The Count of Monte Cristo are somewhat similar, but much better reads."
4,The novel that created the musical,"This book is a great find for any Les Miz fans. The free download was very easy. There are a few titles that appear in the book as M. sur M.__________ Not sure if the original was written like that, or if it's part of the free download. It's not a deal breaker, but if you need a definitive version, I'd opt for one you have to pay for."
2,Unfavorite book of ALL TIME!,"Here's a tip - read the ABRIDGED VERSION! I read theunabridged, and it took me months. This guy could not stay on track -rather than write a story, he wanted to write about EVERYTHING that has EVER happened EVER. When I got to the 40-page description of Paris's sewer system, I nearly killed myself.This story is not completely lacking. There is lots of drama, lots of touching sentiment. However, I also have a thematic problem with this book.Les Miserables GLORIFIES SUFFERING. If you suffer, you are noble and good. If you don't suffer, you are the enemy. Many fans of this book deny this, but it is true. Hugo was a champion of the little person, which is good, but he also embodied all the worst elements of modern liberalism.The musical based on the book is the same way. And you know, it's effective - we all sympathize with the downtrodden - but I really think Les Mis goes too far. And the b*****d should have edited his own work! Christ!"
4,Great book,"The book is definitely 5 stars, but a few words are missing in this translation. The movie pales by comparison."
3,Les Miserables,I am still reading it due to the fact that it is time consuming. I have to read carefully not to miss details. Some of the book has been very good. Other times I have found it boring.
4,Heavy reading but great.,This is a challanging book to read. It is very deep in the speech and thoughts of the time. A lot of background getting to the basic story most of us know. Having said this I am enjoying the challange and have not quite finished the book I look forward everyday to a little quite time reading.
2,Not the greatest book,This book had a lot of examples but I feel it didn't teach how to draw them that much. It showed many funny caricatures but it didn't really give me any thing to work with.
5,Beautiful Brooke,The best part about this movie is Brooke Shields. Her beauty is obvious even at that age. She had some nude scenes. This is the type of film that perhaps can no longer be made in the climate that we live in. Susan Sarandon plays the part of Brooke's mother. Keith Carradine is also along for the ride as a not-so-successful photographer. I highly recommend this film to those who can appreciate the works of David Hamilton and Jock Sturges.
3,Visually appealing but lacks depth.,"Pretty Baby starring Susan Sarandon could've been a great little art film but rather it comes off pretentious and off-kiltered. Brooke Shields sure was a ""pretty baby"" back then and although her fragile but strong-willed performance is good, you just feel kinda like a prevert watching such a young girl portraying a child prostitute. Keith Carradine creeps me out and the film is dated now. Pretty Baby is intriguing but not brilliant."
3,Decent Knife For The Price,"This is a decent knife for the price. I like shape of the blade, the composite grip, and smooth action. It does however open accidently sometimes, which could potentially give you a nasty cut. It's happened both while standing & sitting."
2,"Average Chinese quality, too expensive","The liners are a little thin. Other than that it is acceptable, but the price is just too high.You can get a better Chinese knife from Spyderco's ""Byrd"" brand for about half the price of this Gerber Armor.Columbia River Drifter, also similar quality for much less:http://www.amazon.com/Columbia-River-6450K-Drifter-Handle/dp/B001DZMBY4/"
5,Entertaining for both toddlers and adults,"My 17 month old loves the Bear and has been watching the series since she was 5 months old. Not only do the videos give my husband and I a much needed break while cooking dinner, we also enjoy watching it with our daughter and singing with the Bear and all his friends. This is definitely the best childrens series available today.Volume 3 which focuses on dancing is especially fun, with great music and lots of opportunities to Dance the Day Away. Then the second story Listen UP has an enjoyable array of sounds that your child can play along by trying to imitate."
2,Too difficult to use,"Too difficult and messy to break apart. Not ""scored"" anywhere near enough to break apart without some sort of tool. Once broken apart they work great."
3,Good product but over priced,"So I bought thisbecause it was ""out of season"" in stores. I paid like 30 dollars here and only 6 at walmart ""during season"". So yeah it's overpriced online but if you can't buy it in any stores then I guess you pay or do without. But I will say using the fireplace lowered the electric bill by 80 dollars."
5,Great financial calculator,This is a great financial calculator. The only beef I have with Texas Instruments is they reduced the dissertation size user manual they used to have to a semi useless quick guide that does a great job for basic functions but does not have the full functionality of the entire calculator in it. This calculator deserves a guide that lets both beginners and advanced users utilize it. I got my calculator on sale which made it even a better value. I had the older version of this calculator and some keys may have been removed because it looks a little smaller but all the really necessary functions are still there! There is no better financial calculator available in its price range.Pros: Powerful financial functionsGreat built-in casegood quick user guideCons: Poor explanations of advanced functionsconfusing up and down arrow functionsI still love this calculator and feel you can't do any better if you need functionality for financial problems.
3,miserable,"The prodact is fine, but the delivery is so bad. It said it would arrive the day after when in fact it arrived a week after. Had I known it's gonna be like that, I would have bought it from Staple because it's roughly the same price. Just a few cents cheaper was worth waiting. I would never order thing like this from Amazon again."
4,It is valuable item,"Everything is OK now. Of course, if you want some more utilities, buy the expensive item"
2,Easy to make mistakes,I got this calculator free on a financial course I am taking. It is easy to use but what others say about getting wrong answers seems to be down to the operator buttons on the right hand side being out of line with the main keypad. So you have to watch what you are doing. This and the fact it seems to take so many keypresses to get anything done makes it cumbersome. It is a reasonable calculator for starting out but I would not recommend it if you are in a hurry eg. sitting an exam.
5,easy to use calculator TI BA II plus,The calculator arrived quickly and was in good condition. Would have liked to have had product directions included but it was easy for my son to figure out without the directions
5,Calculators are cool devices,This calculator is just what I need for school I can use it to do all the work for me with out thinking in my head. It even has a way that you can do fractions. I do hate that sometimes the screen has a glare were you can't see the numbers. This thing last a very long time the batteries hadden't ran out on mine's yet.
1,Avoid-,I buy a calculator to perform rote formulas to arrive at a solution. This calculator requires the user to learn a new language. Why buy this when all you need is a HP 12C !!!!
3,make sure you press hard enough,You don't want to omit inputting any digit in your exam. I found this calculator is prone to that. The keys are less sensitive than average calculator products I found out there. You have to press hard enough for every single digit to avoid that.
1,What a crappy product!,"I bought this calculator because I am reviewing for a CFA exam. I have been reading the manual for 6 hours and I still cant make head or tails of it. If I didnt need this $h177y PITA to take the exam, I'd torch it. My review schedule has been screwed up by this. I'm going to go postal!"
5,Your the best,The shipping and service was ultra. I have receivce the calculator very fast . guys U are the best. John
3,Marginal Calculator,"I had to get this calculator for a class. I was surprised that this calculator is so awkward. I have other TI products and I love them, but this calculator is marginal at best."
2,Bad Keys,"Its like the thing has a breakin period. I took it to use on a test without using it beforehand, and I had to bang on the keys to get it to work."
1,difficult,I find this calculator difficult to use. The functions are not intuitive and the buttons are hard to press.
1,Good Binoculars but Not for Navigation,"The name ""mariner"" in the product title would suggest that these binoculars are suitable for marine navigation, especially since they have an integrated digital compass. However, I knew I was in for trouble when I opened the box and read the instruction manual, which listed the accuracy of the compass at plus/minus 5 deg. An error of 5 deg. in marine coastal navigation could place you miles off course, and after comparing the binoculars to a hand-bearing compass and a GPS, I found that the error was actually closer to 7 deg. So, if you want a pretty good pair of binoculars with a novelty compass for fun, then these would be fine for you. If you plan to use them for navigation purposes, they are unusable."
2,don't wait for this to get to your local library...,"...because very few libraries are going to add this to their collection.The poems in this book are one of the most amusing aspects. English teachers: if you're looking for a ""what-not-to-do"" example while teaching poetry, this is the book for you. In fact, this holds true for the prose writing in ""Klooogs"", as well. Very odd book. Could definitely benefit from a good editing or seven."
2,Crash and burn,"Fly With Me is ""a humorous guide to a better flying experience"", written by flight attendant Tera Leilani Walker, and published by Dorrance Publishing.I recently recieved this book to review, and I'm a little surprised to find that all of the other reviews posted here are five stars. I found it painful to get through, which is pretty bad since it is only 43 pages, and took under an hour to read. The ""chapters"" (one or two pages each on topics like passengers with stinky feet) weren't terrible, but the poems at the end of each one were. The main problem I encountered was a surprising number of typos and spelling mistakes and other editing errors. I counted over eight, including a misspelled word in a chapter title, which is a LOT of mistakes for a 43 page book!"
4,Brilliant Ghost Story,"The Others is a brilliant ghost story. The story takes place on one the Channel islands during the end of WWII. Grace Stewart (Kidman) is a young mother of two children that suffer from xeroderma pigmentosum - a rare genetic disorder that make the children allergic to sunlight. Grace awaits for her husband to return from the war. During that time, Grace's servants have suddenly left overnight and 3 mysterious servants arrive the next day. Grace's daughter begin to hear odd sounds and voices. She tells her mother that she sees a family in the house, but Grace doesn't believe her at first. Overtime, Grace starts to hear these mysterious sounds and slowly her sanity is tested.The Others is chilling story, at times I could feel the hairs on my neck bristle. The director did a great job keeping the environment dark and sinister. Nicole Kidman played her role well as did the child actors. I would recommend this movie for the DVD collection."
3,Far too predictable,"This movie was far too predictable, the entire plot was apparent withing the first 10 minutes. Unlike The Sixth Sense, in which the clues were subtle, here they basically hit you over the head with clues.Too bad it had potential..."
4,The Others,I was looking for a spooky movie and what I observed with this one was a big surprise. This is a good psychological thriller if you are into this type of movie.
4,period piece with a twist of lime,"certainly a good movie and Nicole Kidman puts in an excellent performance but I felt I'd already been through all this with the sixth sense. otherwise, a good film. if you're interested in this genre of after death movies, see Waking Life! much more thought provoking than the rest."
1,WASTE OF TIME! CHECK OUT SIXTH SENSE INSTEAD!! OR SIGNS!,"I don't want to waste my time reviewing this waste of time. IT ABSOLUTELY WAS TERRIBLE! NOT ONLY WAS THE SOUND QUALITY ON THE DVD TERRIBLE, THE PLOTLINE AND ACTING [was not good]! TO NICOLE KIDMAN: KEEP YOUR AUSTRAILIAN ACCENT AND THROW YOUR BRITISH ACCENT AWAY! YOU CAN ACT BETTER THAN THIS! RENT ONLY IF YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING DUMB, STUPID AND BORING!"
5,Through the Looking Glass...Darkly,"Brilliant. Not only well acted and haunting but something entirely original. Most ghost stories follow predictable scripts but not this one. It leaves the viewer guessing about the nature of reality...past, present, future, life, death...what's what and who's who?My congratualations to the director and actors. This is a film worth watching."
4,wonderful film of the best and most real life of grounded spirits,"Fionnula Flanagan is brilliant, but Nicole Kidman makes the film the thriller it is, but all the cast are wonderful, particularly the children. It does take a while to get to the best bit, but the message is so good and much more truthful, the research was good.Certainly worth rewatching, and the first viewing is the best, the most powerful.It is one of the best illustrations of how spirits get grounded and why. I love the Eric Sykes and Fionnula Flanagan parts together. oh it would be good to have more of this film, more like this."
3,OK to see once,"A well acted, spooky movie, but once you have seen it there is no need to see it again. All the action is based upon what is revealed at the end of the movie, so a second viewing leaves one wondering why they are wasting time watching the movie. Unless you just like the acting. Rent first, then decide if you want a copy in your library."
4,Very Inteligent Horror Film,"Another fantastic example of a new genre of smart, very well written and very well made horror movies. Had this come before Sixth Sense it would deserve a full 5 stars."
5,Six Sense What ?,"Now I know that the writter of six sense sat back and was like ""damn, thats exactly what i was trying to get across to my audience, what a great f'in movie!"".This has got to be the best film of 2001 and I don't joke around when it comes to these reviews. Standing apluase to Ms. Kidman and the kids, perfect. Extreme fear. I sat in a theatre where a few people could not take the increased heart rate created by this eiry film. Loved it so much that I ordered 2. Underated and missed by many but don't do yourself this injustice any longer and get that dvd. If your not completely satisfied, feel free to mail it to me.Bane."
4,Nicole on Cruise control to stardom,"Nicole Kidman has proven that she was the one with the real talent in her made-for-Hollywood farce of a marriage. Here she runs the gamut and artfully chews up the scenery and delivers an air of intrigue and shock in one of the few true horror films of the last decade or so. Sure, the plot owes a tip of the hat to a certain Bruce Willis film, but it's done well and Kidman keeps the chills percolating from start to finish. Lock the doors and turn out the lights to watch this one."
1,Does this thing end????,"This movie was bad! Patronizing and agonizingly slow, the ending was anti-climatic. A sleeper."
1,i rate this -100,"stupid, confusing, and a dumb plot. please don't waste time getting this junk.reccomended DVDs:Lost-The Complete First SeasonThe Terminalcrappy DVDs:The OthersSabertoothThe OthersThe OthersEight Legged FreaksThe Others"
2,Significant Sound Problems,"This is a very well written movie, beautifully performed and brilliantly filmed. So why only two stars? My experience with the DVD is that it has significant sound problems. I have an excellent home entertainment system capable of managing a wide dynamic range. Nonetheless, I found that I couldn't hear much of this film. Nicole Kidman whispers through the whole thing, which would not be a problem if the levels had been set properly. Perhaps for the theater they were. But on the DVD transfer it is extremely difficult to hear her. This will be especially true if you are in an apartment with a neighbor who would rather not hear the whole film through the walls, or if you wish to watch the film after the kids go to bed.This is a wonderful film, but watch it at a time when you can comfortably pump up the volume. Otherwise, you'll just end up annoyed that you can't hear a word Kidman says."
5,A Great Ghost Story!,This movie is one of my favorite ghost movies out there. I LOVE the twist it has. AWESOME! I HIGHLY recommend this one!
5,WOW,"I was never a fan of Nicole Kidman until after her divorce from Tom Cruise. Perhaps I thought she was only riding on his coattails, but this movie and Kidman's performance in Moulin Rouge prove that she is a gifted actress in her own right. The Others is a stylish thriller taking place during WWII. Kidman plays a nervous mother of two young children who have a genetic disorder that makes it impossible for them to be exposed to sunlight. While Kidman's husband is away fighting in the war, she places an advertisment for a new nanny. That's all I can say about the plot without giving it away.Recommended for Kidman's breathtaking performance, gorgeous cinematography and a truly brilliant script. Kidman should have been doubly nominated for The Others and Moulin Rouge."
4,This was a good movie that had some nice twists and turns,"I would have to say that The Others was a very good DVD. I felt that the film was good, sort of on the same lines as Sixth Sense. I fell that Nicole Kidman's acting was wonderful, and the story was well written and kept you guessing.I think that the picture quality of this DVD was great, and the sound was also very good. I would suggest buying this 2-disc DVD for your collection. A great combination of a good film and high quality DVD."
1,Garbage,"Here's a movie that looked scary because of its trailers, but sucked major Ass! I remember one trailer saying that ""The Others has an ending you won't believe,"" The actual quote should have been, ""The Others has an ending you won't believe . . . They'd use again."" That's right Nicole Kidman and co. are the Ghosts, a totally unexpected plot twist, in 1998, before the sixth sense dominated the box office. Save your money and buy something else."
3,ITS NOT HOW U THINK IT IS.,THIS MOVIE IS NOT HOW I THOUGHT IT WAS. I HTOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE A SCAREY MOVIE BUT ITS NOT. THE WAY THE MOVIE START OUT I THOUGHT IT WAS GONNA BE GOOD. LOOKIN AT THE WHOLE MOVIE MADE ME MAD. I DONT WONNA SEE THAT MOVIE NO MORE AND I DAVISE YALL NOT TO GO AND SEE IT TOO. IF U DO THEN U'LL BE SORRY.
3,"Alright already, we get it","Slow movie that spent WAY too much time on the ""kids can't be exposed to light"" topic. Nicole obviously graduated from the William Shatner school of acting with her overly dramatic rants on the light, and the doors, and ....The concept wasn't bad and the ending provided a nice twist, but by the time the ending finally got there I was more relieved that they finally explained it than shocked at the twist. Overall not a bad movie, but not an overly good one either. There are several movies that I would rather spend my time watching."
2,Ugh,"I am sorry, I love Nicole Kidman, but god, this movie bit. The person in front of us kept nodding off. Me and my friend couldn't stop laughing during most of the movie. Nicole looked oh so threating with a shotgun. I was tempted, but didn't, to shout out ""Hail to the king, baby!"" Hmmm...what eles...the movie dragged on until the last 5 minutes. It's not as scary as they portray it in the commercials. Some parts, the end and the Nicole vs. The door part, were a bit predicatable. There really wasn't much to the whole plot of the movie. I'm giving it 2 stars for the interesting twist at the end. Best way to enjoy this movie? Go to see it at night, when nobody else is, and do your own Mystery Science Theater. Sorry, but come on...ugh."
4,"SUPERB EXECUTION, EVEN IF KNOW WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN","Great setup, some really intense acting by the Kidman character + her kids that really creeps up on you, and above all, exhileratingly chilling use of audio visual accoutrements to create that really haunting feel.Problem is, you have likely seen The Sixth Sense, and remember it, which makes the denouement of The Others so painlessly guessable that it's a bit of a gyp. You catch on fairly early that someone is not what they seem, but then you spend an hour restraining yourself from hitting the fast-forward to find out the answer.Great rental watch, and a pretty fiesty treat to learn how to use sound to make the audience's hair stand, but just not as much of a thriller it could have been if it was released pre-6th sense."
4,Fun and energetic...,"The music on this CD is fun and energetic, but overall, the CD isn't quite as good as their first one. If you like the pipes and drums you'll probably enjoy this one. Not recommended for devoted traditionalists, though."
2,Buggy songs,"I suppose this is the official soundtrack, but it's missing many of the songs I would have expected. If you go to ""Spotify"" and ask for the ""Lost in Translation"" soundtrack, if gives you some of these songs, plus many more! But the reason I returned this digital download was the last track, labeled as a 12 minute song, is really only 3 minutes and a lot of dead air thereafter."
1,worst summerslam ive ever seen,this summerslam is by far mediocraty at its best.cause thats what this ppv was mediocre i own lots of summerslams and this is not the one i would get cause its very lame boring and slow. i would rather watch the man with the golden gun or license to kill better than this.20th summerslam at its worst.mr mcmahon should be ashamed.
3,Adequate but imperfect,"This book gives you enough information to pass the MPRE (it doesn't take much), but it certainly doesn't teach you enough to get a perfect score, as it completely omits certain sections of the Code in its discussion. To summarize:Positives:Offers sample examsOffers outline in both print and video format, so you can choose what works best for you.One of the only study aids that covers the most recent rules change.You'll learn enough to pass the MPRE.Negatives:Only offers explanation for one of the mock exams.Many exam questions are identical to those offered on the MPRE's official site.Some topics are not discussed."
3,"I Don't Use It Much, But...","...it seems to be working just fine, so far. It was a pretty good deal on Amazon and was recommended by that Family Handyman magazine. It's nice and low-profile and fits well behind my t.v."
3,Wrong picture,"The picture is wrong for this item, as is the description. Description says it connects threaded pipe to hose, which it would appear to do from the picture. Actually, the two ends are the same and it connects two hoses."
5,Golden resource,I almost felt like I was cheating on the CLAD test. This handbook was a wonderful resource and the only one I used to pass the test .... the FIRST time!!
4,Helpful resource,I'm using the book in my class on Working with English Language Learners. It is an informative book for someone who has not experienced that in their classroom. I will say though that the author makes her opinions well known on the US government policies around immigration and it is not a conservative opinion. Her call to teachers for activism is a bit much for my taste.
1,One of the worst singers of our time!,"Very plain voice, even off-key on some notes. Zero star appeal.Get another -- any other -- CD from amazon.com!"
2,Not a Very Good Film,"A supposed comedy by Neil Simon starring two charming stars, Sandy Duncan and Tony Roberts at their most unattractive. Sandy is a Southern Conservative girl living in San Francisco in the 60s. Tony Roberts is a liberal and writes for a radical newspaper. They end up living together in the same apartment building and falling in love. Not very charming and not very funny. Good thing Neil Simon made it better with The Goodbye Girl. I like the theme song though, sang by Davy Jones. It seems the song has outlived the film."
1,Not really true,"As a student of Korean history and culture and as the mother of a Korean adoptee I found this book to be very disturbing. From the stereotype of the father as an alcoholic, gambling, wife-beating, adulterer who had no interest in his daughters to the first wife who just submits to her fate and just lies down and dies when her husband wants to divorce her...I found the story line unreal and contrived.Go ahead and enjoy this as fantasy but don't think you've learned anything about Korea or reasons children are relinquished for adoption."
5,Lucky For Me,I was so very lucky to have been able to have been at many of their concerts. It was the first time I saw people become so very Irish. I will never forget '95.My brother & I were changed by the experience. We with the band well.
3,", Description Inaccurate, but Fits my 6 Gallon Rigid Shop Vac","My 6 gallon Rigid shop vac says it takes VF4000, VF5000 or VF6000 filters. Amazon claims that this one is a ""Rigid VF4000 Standard Filter for WetDry Vac, by Rigid"". Pretty clear, right? You're going to get a filter made by the company that made the vacuum. Not so fast... What Amazon actually ships is a filter made by Green Klean, ""Designed as a Replacement for VF 4000"". A note on the box says: ""This is not a product, nor is it sponsored or endorsed by RIGID, Inc.""The filter does fit my Rigid shop vac, and it seems to work. Time will tell if it will last as long as the original Rigid filters. I am not happy with Amazon for their misleading product description. I might have bought the filter if they had described it accurately, but I would like the ability to make an informed decision about it."
1,Faulty Unit - Had to be returned,"Faulty unit, not OEM, did not fit properly and leaked so needed to be returned. Would not buy this again. Went to Home Depot and found OEM product for near same price, but had to drive"
3,Product worked as stated,"First let me add that you really need to buy a 3 layer filter versus this one for most things. However, this filter is as described and worked well, but I went back and bought the 3 layer. If you want to pick up fireplace or ""fine"" materials this filter is not the best."
4,Packaging,The packaging was not good. The filter was sent in half a box and taped up on one side. Probably meant to be sold in a matched pair. But it looked hokey.
1,Not well-received,Sorry to tell you that my granddaughters (ages 7 and 9) did not enjoy this. With some exceptions they did not think it was either funny or clever.
5,Hilariously Funny!,"Minda Webber will take you on a fun and zany ride with a character of a famous classical fictional story, and twist them so you are just cracking up. She'll make fun of cliches and you'll keep wanting more. Read this series, you won't regret it!"
3,ending was cute,"I had a hard time getting into this book. I really liked Ian, but Claire was a little too muddle headed for me. Since I started the book I had to finish it, but by about half way through it I found myself wanting to read it. It is not the best book I have read, but it is also not the worst. I would probably read it again if I had nothing else to read. I would be interested in finding out more about Claire's friend Jane Van Helsing and the vampire Asher (maybe together??)."
5,Maria,"I am very pleased with this order and delivery. It is my understanding that this product was discontinued and it is the only product that does not break my skin out. So, I am VERY pleased I was able to find it rapidly on Amazon.Thank you Amazon!!!"
5,"L'Oreal Natural Match Hair Color, 3N Natural Black","I like & using this hair color from years ,I do not get this from market but I am still getting it from Amazon. Because of some of my skin problems I can not use all other hair colors.I will recommend this color to my family & friends who have any skin problems."
5,Every emotion....,"A rollercoaster of emotion is what this book evokes. A must for every parent to read...difficult but very necessary...will literally give you a physical reaction. Very very powerful book. However, the concept of pedophilia being a disease is hard to swallow...but at least one will be able to understand the author's point of view. SHould be mandatory for parents and anyone working in a related social/health care position. Everyone should know!"
2,Such a disappointment!,"Although I'll be assassinated for writing this (as others gave it such a good review), this was truly a poor film. Chow Yun-Fat deserved a better vehicle to bring back the legendary figure of Ko San. Wong Jing again shows his aptitude filling films with his usual crass comedy. It's sad to think that 'The Boss Of Dross' made such films as Last Hero In China and of course the original. Basically, if Wong Jing had released his holiday snaps under this title it still would have cleaned up at the box-office."
3,Quantum Battery 1 Compact,I purchased this to help with flash battery coverage during wedding receptions. I was a bit disappointed in it's life span and ended up with 2 of them to get me through a reception.
2,horrible charger design,plantronics product designers please go back to design school. i can't believe that this actually won some awards. the charger is horrible and caused a lot of confusion and frustration. i kept thinking it was charging but it wasn't. scotch tape didn't help at all either. if you push too hard or too little it won't charge. when you do get it to charge it eventually pops loose and stops charging. note i was always charging the device on my desk with no movement not in my pocket as they claim you can.
2,Not impressed,"I only used it two days, and it wasn't always easy to hear with. I didn't notice that it slipped out of my ear and was lost while I was shopping. I won't buy this model again."
4,"good idea, great features, not that sturdy","I like the sound quality of this headset, and the controls are very intuitive. Plantronics provided a host of helpful accessories, including a battery charging device and adapters that allow you to use your phone charger (if you use a compatible device) instead of carrying another charger. Pairing was a snap, and the talk time is better than represented. My only complaint is the earpiece itself; they provide three separate sizes (great!), but they are very delicate and become loose easily, which causes the headset to drop down. A few efforts to contact Plantronics on the matter have been unsuccessful; hopefully they will replace the part at no charge."
2,Plantronics 645 Bluetooth Headset,"Overall, the unit is ok. Not a glowing review but if no wired headsets were available, I would use this. The quality on my end is very good. However, most people on the other end of the line complain of poor quality audio, clipping, and static. As soon as I terminate the bluetooth connection they instantly say, ""that's much better!""I have the unit paired with a Blackberry Pearl 8100. Hopefully those of you using the Pearl will have better success pairing with this headset."
3,Jewish Study Bible,"Being that I am not Jewish, I approached this Bible with anticipation in seeking an accurate depiction of scripture with no idea as to what I might expect. I must say that this Bible is very informative and very easy to read, appears to be true to scripture and enlightening; however, it seems to be painted with somewhat of a liberal commentary."
2,"ACTUALLY I AM REVEWING THE ""LOOK IN PAGES""","Why when I ""searched the pages"" was there not even one page of the actual Bible scripture to see how it was presented in format and content? There were many many pages of the glossary (one would have done) and many many pages of the maps (one would have demonstrated their detail), etc. - yet not one page of scripture - which is why I would buy this Bible or not.Also - why don't Bible descriptions by default have to include a ""Font Size"" - this is very important."
1,Rip Off,"What a rip off!!!Only 72 pages for $79.95!! How can you justify such a huge price for such poor value? I was expecting a tome of women's shared experiences around the world for such a price.At the back of the book are eight pages for buying the book new for $19.95. But I wouldn't even pay that price for a second hand book that is written in in ink.23 blank pages to fill in as a diary. 4 pages of calendar months for charting.The book begins on page 7. and actually is the only page worth reading, but certainly not worth $79.95This is definitely not a book I would recommend to anyone. I wouldn't even give it one star! But I had to to write this comment."
3,"Great Album, But not for Computer","When an honest person byes a great CD as this one is, he is quite offended that it cannot be played normally on a computer or be transfered to an iPOD. I am all for ""official"" CD's and have or will never purchase pirated ones, nor do I participate in in file swapping. But in order to get this protected disc onto my iPOD, I had to purchase it a second time from I-tunes. I am sure that the real pirates will get around the new protection scheme, but those of us who are honest will suffer."
1,Defective product,"I wish I knew if this recording was good or not. The dual format CD/DVD does not work. I thought the first defective and Amazon promptly replaced it. The newer version does not work either, it just clicks away. I tried it both in my MAC G4 as well as my Sony CD player. Nada. Invest your money is something that might actually work and avoid dual format."
1,Don't buy this CD,"Once again, Sony strikes. You can't put this on your iPod. Bette Midler: they're really targeting the artists with the criminal element as their fan base."
2,Sticky Buttons,"Purchased this phone for my in-laws to replace an older phone. within a month the buttons started to stick. Would only dial one number when I returned it. Volume seemed to be good and without roar with a hearing aid. Speed dial function a little to complicated for the elderly, plus the lack of a lighted dial makes it difficult for those with low vision to see the buttons."
5,Inspiring,"I picked up this book 20 years ago when I was 14 and didn't know what I wanted to do in life. After reading it, I knew exactly what I wanted to do. I wanted to build P-1. Though I've gone in different directions since then, I can still read this every few years and reaffirm why I wanted to get into computers. It's tightly and amusingly written, with just enough tech and just enough pathos to keep you in the know and keep you going. Not just a good story, but a good look into what makes us human, nasty little emotions and all. After 23 years, the tech is more than a bit out of date, but it doesn't keep you from wondering."
2,1930's back-to-the-farm memoir from central NJ,"The well-traveled Campbells buy land near Lambertville, New Jersey and despite the lack of modern conveniences like electricity, settle in happily to become small farmers. The book is a series of chapters that function as stand-alone short stories of farm life - amusing livestock, charming neighbors, rueful mistakes, etc."
5,"Fantastic sub, but check the price","This is a fantastic sub. It has very crisp, responsive bass. Most larger speakers are a bit muddy or can't sustain a bass note for long as a low current circuit can't recharge a driving capacitor fast enough. No problems here. You'll love it for music and movies both.Amazon's got to do some work on the price, however. Their current ""list"" of $399 is $50 higher than the real Yamaha list price. I normally buy everything I can from Amazon because I like the reliability and consolidated shipping. The current $349 price is 40% higher than other merchants. If you go price shopping yourself, be sure you're checking prices with the piano black finish."
4,Great resource,"I live in CT and wanted to take up hiking.. I was pleasantly surprised with the range of hikes covered in this book. Especially areas I never would have thought had a decent hike, like my hometown of Waterbury! Because of the amount of hikes covered, the info for each is pretty short. It does suggest other places to get info though and is great for what it is- a survey of New England hikes, not in depth for any one area or type of hike."
2,Don't fit well at all,"These are made for standard 5"" gutters but I have yet to make them fit as the manufacturer intended. They will clip to the interior front of the gutter, but clipping to the back makes the front pop out and vice versa. So I just have the front clipped in and use the gutter guard screen (additional product) to hold it all tight. Time will tell if it all stays in place and keeps the gutters cleaner."
5,From The Creator!,"A labor of Love! Julie Harris, Queen of the American stage as well as co-star with James Dean in ""East of Eden"" and Michael York, legendary film star (both dear friends of mine) do an unbelievable reading. You will not find Sappho read with such passion. I felt that it would be wonderful to have a man read as well as a woman. Michael York was my first choice, and he blows me away. See my other projects. Enjoy! Email is welcome in regards to all my (BMP,Ltd.) projects.Craig Braginsky"
4,Great for a first book.,"I bought this book for my 10 year old granddaughter. She asked for a microscope and I bought her one. since we have been to the pond together to get water for my microscope, I wanted to get her a book about pond water. This is not a how-to book as the first reviewer states, so I also bought a how-to book to go along with this book."
5,Young and fresh,"As this still is available from third party sellers, it is worth writing some words on it. The suite op. 29 is really perfectly performed, with a lot of pep and go. Great fun!The wind quintet op. 26 is performed with slightly slow tempos, although Schoenberg wrote ""Schwungvoll"". Atherton obviously has some reason with the relaxed proceedings, I feel that this version of op. 26 goes deeper and at the same time feels warmer, sunnier, than some other performances I have heard. After the thrills of op. 29, it is nice to sit down and be immersed in this.If you like to experience Schoenberg's youthly fresh exploring of the dodecaphonic method of composing - he was around 50 years by the time of composing these two gems! - this CD will not disappoint you. Just like fresh leaves of May!"
5,music great/ special packaging....ok,"as a longtime seal fan i will love every song on this album. the music grows on you more and more each time you hear it, and you savour the nuances of the background instrumentation, or melody, and feel the power of seals unmatched vocals. by all means buy anything seal, but i do have to say that the special packaging for the album was rather dissapointing because it is really only a vinyl album type cover and an insert of card stock shaped and printed like a vinyl record, with the cd stuck on the middle. I have purchased other special edition albums, such as tori amos's recent scarlet's walk set, which were much more satisfying for the price, with extra art, a dvd, and such. If I had to do it again, I would probably just get the regular packaged album in this case. If you would enjoy the nostalgia of the record cover then go for it, and it does make a statement that seal's music, like an old 45, will instantly become classic."
2,Cheaply made,"This toy was NOT worth the money!! The broom and ""mop"" fell apart as soon as my daughter opened the box. The ""caddy"" is pretty sturdy and the dust pan and hand broom are the only things that have not broken so far. Very very disapointed =("
2,cena dvd,lol im a big fan of cena but the documentary is a joke he doesnt tell u any thing its just from friends and family wwe is so stupid the god dam christian cage instant classic documentary is much better then this
1,Yoyoyoyoyoyoy wurd up tuganomics I'm a white boy rappuh,"I guess you could consider me a Cena-hater. Then again, who could like a guy who acts like a white-boy rapper, actually does rap (badly, I should say) and has little to no wrestling ability, and has been pushed to glorious ""exalted"" status, as I call it, meaning he's the WWE champion for over a year nonstop, without losing it once, and ALWAYS in the main event of every PPV and TV show. If WCW were still around, Cena would not be big business for the WWE.If you like untalented ""wrestlers"" who have really dirtpoor gimmicks and really bad mic skills, you'd probably like Cena. If you're not a Cena fan, you really won't care about his car collection or his house. And with only seven matches featured, you won't really feel satisfied with this, even if you are a Cena fan."
3,Sleep Sheep,"I like it I just wish it would've gone longer on time, it goes up to 45 minutes. I will be keeping it on the carseat/stroller for on the go and I will purchase a different machine for the baby room with a longer time frame."
5,Great gift!,This was given to me from my mother for my daughter and I'm so impressed! Used this during nap time because my neighbor was hammering something into the wall next door. My little one slept through the racket thanks to this noisemaker. I also like it because I am able to get things done around the house without tip-toeing around for fear of waking the baby.
4,Part of my top 10 you need,"I really like the softness as I could snuggle it right up to her. I bought this for my 3rd child. My first two had sound machines in their room, but nothing for travel. This was awesome for car rides.I have two negatives. I wish there was a continuous play; my daughter would wake if it stopped. I also wish there was a shut off button instead of having to turn the volume dial.I would highly recommend this product as is, for those are minor negatives."
5,A favorite.,This was perfect on a recent trip. Used on the airplane to cover the noise so he could sleep and attached to the pack and play he slept in at our destination easily. Love the choices of sounds it plays.
2,Storybook missing,"I am an expectant mom. I haven't used it yet. I just opened the box. I like the softness of the toy. However, the storybook mentioned on the box is missing."
2,"Got my baby to sleep great, woke her up the second it turned off!!!!!","If this had a contiuous play option, I would say this is the greatest baby item ever invented.But it doesn't.My baby fell asleep a lot easier with the soothing ocean sound but needed the sound on to stay asleep. We lost several good nights and ruined a few naps before we figured out what was going on. It's a great idea but we're just going to buy a sound machine for the baby's room and get rid of this."
4,Gave as a gift,The new mother said that she was very pleased with this product. She liked that it had a volume control.
2,"Good in theory, BUT..","We owned the original size sleep sheep when my now-5 year old was born, and although we liked the product fine, it wasn't a must-have. When my youngest son (now 5 months old) started showing signs of colic, we bought the travel version hoping that it would help him to at least rest a little while we were out and about. The product has all kinds of technical difficulties - there's a timer that's supposed to allow the sound to play for either 25 or 45 minutes. Doesn't work. The machine frequently shuts off after a few minutes, usually right as the baby is about to go to sleep which of course wakes him back up. Also, I often have trouble getting it to play at all and have to fiddle for 5 minutes with the volume knob and trying different buttons to get it to start. It's not the batteries because we change them constantly. Just a faulty unit, I'm sure but for $25 I expected better."
5,The Perfect Baby Gift,Snuggly and cute - and always welcome. This sheep serves the double purpose of a cuddly toy and a sleep soother. The sounds are great and both baby and mom loved the gift. Terrific for baby showers.
4,Missing 1 feature,"I basically got this for the baby's heartbeat sound, but comes to find out it doesnt have it, but I still like the other sounds it has.."
2,"Had potential, but too many errors spoiled it!","This book had me initially very excited. Although a bit confusing in overall structure and flow, it had its moments. The first sign of trouble was when I installed the JDK which I downloaded. The book's instructions on how to name the directories had conflicting examples, happily I worked through that one on intuition. It starts to get unbearable when the examples in the book AND cd have syntax and logical errors. Not being one to waste my money completely, I will continue reading the book (albeit with a critical eye) to grasp some, hopefully not entirely incorrect, concepts. Sorry to say, I am very disappointed."
1,Broad but full of errors and annoying style,"The good part is that the book covers a broad range of Java-related stuff. However, the writing style is annoying at times, and is almost impossible to understand at some points. Worst of all though, are all the errors. The book can't have been proof-read, the samples contain errors (even on the CD) and have obviously not been tested. A typical example is the JDBC chapters, which explain the underlying mechanisms in detail, but every single example contains syntactical and other errors. When reading this book, I found myself getting so annoyed that my wife forced me to throw it out. There must be better books that cover the same topics. Please look for them."
1,Full of errors! Often uses JDK 1.1 instead of 1.2,This is worst tech book i have ever bought. It's obvious that they tried to rush it to market because no one seems to have edited it. The writer obviously does not have a good idea of what changed from 1.1 to 1.2. I hardly ever use this book and can never really trust it. It's a thick book but covers very little in detail.
5,love those funky beats,"Aphrodite is a master of funky jungle, and this disk is nonstop.Prior to owning it, I'd heard only ""Woman That Rolls"", and I hafta say, the quality level is consistent to that standard. This disc just blows me away every time I hear it."
2,Aphrodite,"Not the best, not the worst. Some good cuts, some filler bs. I recomend buying it used- better value. Also, buy with other used cds, 'cause it wears out quickly."
5,One of the best,"Aphrodite's self titled release is arguably the best jungle CD that I have ever heard. For the first two weeks that I had this CD, I listened to nothing else. Aphrodite has explored nearly every element of jungle in this album. The Slider remix of Rising Quince has become my favorite jungle beat. I have been a huge fan of jungle for the past 4 years, and this CD is at the top of my list. If you haven't heard it, buy it now. It will be an investment you won't regret."
1,Garbage... pure garbage.,"Like the header says - pure garbage. Save your money because this is simply the most worthless publication I have ever read. At best, I suspect that a 5-year-old might (I stress the word ""might"") find more of these practical jokes funny. At worst, the practical jokes (I use the term loosely) are boring and unimaginative, put into a format that is pure drivel. Honestly, I only found three (THREE!) of the listed ""pranks"" as funny, but has to disqualify two of them as ""practical"" due to the fact that they would undoubtedly result in my getting fired from my job. So, that leaves me with one - ONE - tidbit which I would qualify as a joke that would be both funny and ""practical"".Bottom line: Not worth the paper it's printed on...."
3,I need to learn more,"I have had this RCA pro 8x zoom auto focus for about two weeks and it has been a joy doing the basic things with it, it shows a very good picture and it is very light weight, I would like to learn more about it, but I do not have the manual, can you PLEASE help me by getting me a manual, If you need more information about the camcorder just let me know and I will send it to you. Thank you in advance Sylvester Bingham"
4,Saw Chicago Live the same year,"I saw Chicago in 1971 and 1972 at Arie Crown Theater in Chicago. This is essentially the same show/s I saw and they were fabulous. I remember I could hardly wait to get my hands on this Box of 4 LP's. Deal was they were all warped to some degree. Returned it, same deal. With the CD's no worry about that! Excellent!"
5,"Oh, so that was what all the excitement was about!","I was a huge Chicago fan back when this album came out. I was a teenage trumpet player and Chicago was by far my favorite band. I was disappointed when Carnegie Hall came out. I think it was the extended solos that I wasn't ready for, but I can also remembering not liking the quality of the recording. Now I am a 45 year old man that has seen Chicago many times in concert. I enjoy the shows, but realize that Chicago will never be what they were. Now I just bought this new release of the Carnegie Hall set. WOW!!! I never realized how much this band was smokin' during these recordings. They were just awesome during that week. The only problem now is that I can never go see Chicago again. If you have forgotten just how good the band was in the old days, you need to listen to this set. But be warned, you may never want to listen to their later stuff when you hear how they have paled ever since."
4,Chicago Rocked!!!!!!,"I think i saw a review that was titled somethng like worth it for the bonus disc alone. I agree a lot of the songs on the regular three discs stick close to the studio versions. Some are just as good and some are not Chicago toured hard back in the day and at this point in their tour were tired. As far as the fourth disc is concerned there are three songs that are better than the studio versions.1. Listen2. Sing A Mean Tune Kid3. South California PurplesI urge everyone to listen to South California Purples it gets stretched out here to an amazing 12 minutes. Listening to this will have you realize why Jimi Hendrix said that Terry Kath was better than himself. Terry plays some of his best and most intense playng on this song he absolutely shreds. Robert Lamm gives a great vocal along with lots of Hammond B3. The rest of the band is great as well, you will not be bored during the 12 minutes!!!!!"
3,"It works, but has some shortcomings...","I've used Quantum Battery products for over 15 years. This battery works and does what it is supposed to do. My only gripe (which is why I returned it for a refund) is that you have to remove the battery door from the flash unit (Canon 430 EZ II), insert the battery cable adapter, and tighten a tension screw that is supposed to hold the plug into the batter compartment. As I mentioned, this works, but have a cable coming out the right side of the flash gets tangled up with my right hand when I need to make adjustments to my camera. The recycle time isn't any better than just using some NiMH rechargeables."
4,Kathleen Turner is Bliss,"I would listen to Kathleen Turner tell any story. She gives Vicky Bliss just the right smart alecky and yet oh-so sexy tone, as only Kathleen Turner can do. This book was a delight to listen to. The plot is complex enough to be interesting but direct enough that you always could follow the story even if listening sessions needed to be interrupted by hours or even by several days. If you listen to mysteries on tape, I wholeheartedly recommend you listen to this one."
4,"Old ""Skool"" Kung Fu!!","Initially, I was un-comfortable about watching two crippled men fight kung fu,,,,but after all the hype I saw on amazon,,I was compelled to this this one out.This flick is my first experience with both Jackie Conn and Frankie Shum,,,I must admit, I was pleasantly surprized,,,the cinematography and choreography was excellent, and well done. The fight scenes were simply amazing,,and a very tight plot,,,,,,not bad at all,,,well worth watching...After seeing this one,,,i'm now compelled to check out the other flick with both men,, ""Crippled Heroes"""
3,A Classic Approach To Work,"This book is a refreshing review of why we work and how we should enjoy the work we do everyday. Rooted in many of the philosphers from the past to the current, this book points you to seach your soul on whether you are working to satisfy and income requirement or becuase you are working for enjoying while getting paid at the same time. Truly this book intends to encourage you to enjoy your work and if you do not enjoy your work FIND one you do enjoy."
3,"Not what I expected, but it's pretty","This bracelet is smaller than I expected and actually looks like I should have paid $8 instead of $15. It is very pretty though. I bought as a gift for my MIL but ended up giving it to my daughter instead, she's 4."
2,Small,The dimensions on this are inaccurate. They are measurements of the exterior size..not the actual living space. A little small for a large rabbit
5,Still the best,"These blades are becomming hard to find, but I still think they're the best blades around. They provide a cleaner shave than the regular Excels and are a lot cheaper than any of the three-blade varieties."
4,WHAT?!,"This collection is good, but not great. I found the Austin segments on the RAW 15th Anniversary DVD more entertaining. I am very grateful for the Survivor Series '96 bout with The Hitman, though.Nonetheless, Stone Cold was the man and I seriously doubt wrestling and the WWE will ever experience another boom like they did with him & The Rock, as well as with Hulk Hogan in the mid-80's.A W/WW/F/E fan since the the days of Bob Backlund and Vince's canary yellow jackets, I lived for Monday nights from 1997-2001. It's been completely downhill since Austin turned heel at WM-X7 in Houston (an awesome match with The Rock!). The biggest glimmer of hope for me since was WMXX in '04 with Benoit winning the title at MSG. That ended and we've been stuck with nothing but John Cena & HHHHHHHHH ever since. Eh...Austin's legacy will live on and probably haunt the McMahon's for generations to come as they'll never tap into another persona like Stone Cold's ever again."
5,OH HELL YEAH!!!,"I haven't seen the other collections of Stone Cold, but I can definitely say this one is awesome. It follows Austin from the begining. Its a must have for any fan of Stone Cold Steve Austin...AND THATS THE BOTTOM LINE....."
1,Lackluster,It's Steve Freaking Austin!!!! Throw me a bone! Matches are off the hook but from what I remember no documentary or if it did have one it was horrible. Skip this one....
2,Why?!,"Don't get me wrong, I am a huge Steve Austin fan. But why is the WWE releasing yet another Stone Cold dvd. I mean come on ain't six dvd's enough? besides it will prob. feature the same old matches and segments as the first six"
5,Deserves its bestseller ranking,"What do you want to learn about real estate? How to calculate returns? How to buy foreclosures? How to make money with repairs, renovations, and fixer-uppers? How to manage for good profits and low hassle? How to take advantage of the tax laws? Then, this is the book you are looking for. It doesn't just hand out cliche`s and generalities. These authors clearly give you uniquely sensible ""how to"" information, but at the same time they motivated me to discover and create my own opportunities."
4,great book,This book was very helpful. After reading it I understand the terminology and princinples behind real estate investment. I would definitely recommend this book to new investors! I would also recommend first reading Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki and Think Like a Billionaire by Scot Anderson.
2,not useful for average real estate investor,"I was disappointed with the book. Actually the first 1/2 of it because I couldn't finish it. There is a lot of information, but little that is very practical to the average real estate investor. So can't understand why it's made it to 5 editions. Some previous reviews couldn't understand why there were so many positive reviews, and neither can I. Has the author asked friends / acquaintances to hype the book on Amazon?"
3,Decent Book,I have found this book somewhat helpful. There are other books out there that are better. It is still a good value and worth buying.
2,Disappointed,"Save your money - this CD has a couple hits (not many for 4 CD's)the rest is trash. Songs that did not receive any radio play. Disk 3 is full of an unknown DJ playing ""his"" favorite songs from back in the day. The CD lists sound cool, don't let it fool you. LaDiDaDi one of my favorites was cut in the middle. After Disk 1, it's all downhill."
5,Very Informative,"This book deals with the relevance of Sri Aurobindo in the context of Ken Wilber's integral philosophy. There is no doubt that Vrinte sides more with Aurobindo that Wilber and his points are worth pondering very seriously. Vrinte has done his homework and understands Wilber's work in depth. If one merely reads it to get an overview of Wilber and Aurobindo, the book is worth the read. However, the real meat is the in depth study and comparison of Wilber and Aurobindo. This will be destined to become a classic in the field."
1,Faulty,"Item showed up as promised, however it did not work. Plus it has taken almost 4 weeks for the product to be picked up and returned. Hence I'm still waiting for a credit."
5,True Kabala,"Cosmology is enlightening, this is one of the books you definitely need to get started in the Kabalistic view on the Creation. It is sometimes a bit technical, it gives you the information but you'll need other books by the same author and author Shlomo Weiss to further understand and appreciate what is being presented, if you really want to read Shlomo Weiss it would be helpful to read A Brief History of Time by S. Hawking (no mathematics in any of these books don't worry). The whole Kabalistic Theory is just out of this world literally, if you start down this path your life will change."
5,Kabalah as it is,"Excellent translation and commentary.A ""must have"" for anyone interested in mysticism. R. Kaplan's makes the most esoteric and complex Kab(b)alah text altmost intelligible.Some erratas."
5,Not For Space Buffs Only,"Well written. Jensen does a nice job of avoiding sappy emotionalism and technical speak. Excellent job of showing how the Challenger explosion was less a technical failure and more of a management failure. Vividly describes how the how the culture at NASA had devolved from the heights of Apollo into the bloated, compartmentalized bureaucracy that exisited in 1985. In the chapter about the tele-conference on the night before launch you can really sense the fear in the engineers as it dawns on them that NASA is going to launch anyway. Finally, Jensen's look at Richard Fennyman and the Rogers Commission is brilliant...brought back the stunning moment when I saw the o-ring in the ice water. This is the best book on the Challenger explosion."
2,Lacking in variety,"I have to firmly disagree with the reviewer below. As a fan of Justice, Vitalic and others in the French Electro scene I had high hopes for this album. However, after listening each song on this album they comes through as more of the same. The style and effects used on each track seems almost recycled song after song. The album does not scream variety to say the least. There doesn't seem like there is a broad creative expression, instead almost a French stubbornness.Another thing that bugs me is that a lot of it sounds like reworked Boys Noize tracks rather than having a distinct flair of originality.Honestly, I would recommend the following five albums over this one any day:Justice - CrossVitalic - FlashmobDaft Punk - DiscoveryYuksek - Away From The SeaBloody Beetroots - Rombarama"
2,"useful at times, but overall boring to read","The most useful part of this book is the multitude of quotes supplied for every character, theme, and episode. The book is also peppered with interesting sidebars containing trivia, the show's famously funny stage directions, and Buffyverse info only noticeable through multiple watchings. Yet the character descriptions, intro to Buffy mythology, bios, and other text-heavy parts of the book are deadened by a juvenile style of writing that lacks color yet overdoses on complimentary language. If you are considering buying this book, you probably already know how great ""Buffy"" is and how clever Whedon is, and don't need to be convinced. The general gushiness, which is tempered and balanced by serious character and plot review in other books, is dull when supported only by lengthy, boring recaps. My suggestion: buy it used, because it's not worth the list price or Amazon's price."
5,The Watcher's Guide: It has it all!,"The Watcher's Guide contains EVERYTHING that a Buffy fan needs to know - and stuff that you don't! Try a tour of Buffy's bedroom, a list of spells used in the show, an episode guide, a monster guide, interviews with cast, crew and creator Joss Whedon, notable quotables, a guide to Sunnydale, the Slayer handbook (according to Buffy Summers), a love interest section, and much, much more! I would reccomend this guide for anyone who watches and loves Buffy - and everyone who doesn't! Definately worth reading; and again, and again, and again!"
3,"The 1979-80 ""Shades Of IH"" Was WAY Better, you know...","I LOVE IH, but there isn't anything here that's not been released except for those three tracks. And I'll just BET you that that IH-sycophant ""Campbell Devine"" had something to do with the selection of the material. It's an OK intro to IH if you're an IH-Mott novice, but the man's absolute BEST songs (""All American Alien Boy,"" ""Overnight Angels,"" ""We Got To Get Out Of Here,"" ""Rock And Roll Queen,"" ""Good Man In A Bad Time""...you know...) ain't included here, and, besides, IT'S ALL BEEN DONE BEFORE..."
5,adjectives for this include...,"- dreamy- ethereal- otherworldly- transcendent- historical- haunting- melancholyAnd above all else, beautiful. Caroline rocks! This album just blows my mind. It's so, well, just see above. Favorites include So Uncool, Innocence Sleeping and Greenwood Laddie. The Armenian on Handful of Ashes is a bit too much for me to handle and borderline pretentious but that's really my only issue with this album. Caroline is humble, genuine and brilliant. Her other two albums are good too but this is my favorite of the three."
3,Somebody's Hero,"Fairly mixed results...wish someone ( Todd ) or anybody with a generous spirit would have tweaked the masters to produce an overall better product. Dee Allen's ""Somebody's Hero "" stands out as the best effort."
2,Heel Repair Wrap,"I'm not crazy about the wraps. They tend to come off while sleeping. Maybe using them while watching TV or reading. However, I wouldn't recommend them."
1,WRONG BATTERY SHIPPED,I have returned the incorrect item to seller for a credit (refund); hopefully I'll see a credit on my credit card statement soon! The ordered battery number and the invoice number were correct. Item received was not.
4,too 80s for my tastes,"Take that as you will. If you like synthesizers and 80s music, you will probably enjoy this album. Personally, I prefer the funkier Gal, such as her earlier albums ""Gal Costa,"" ""Legal,"" ""India,"" and ""Cantar."" The songs are still pretty good, but the production is awful, in my admittedly biased opinion."
1,WARNING,The image shows a tape with SP 60 minutes but be sure to read the print -- you are only getting a SP 40 minute tape.
1,DUMB,How people get money to make these movies is beyond me.the movie was cheesy and the acting was as bad.It was part MTV video at times also with all the music they played during it.I can't think of nothing good to say about it.
5,Clarke Tin Whistle Book & CD,The Clarke Tin Whistle; Deluxe Edition (Book & CD) is the perfect way to learn how to play the tin whistle.I had never played the tin whistle and after just a few hours I was playing simple songs. This book and CD will teach you all you need to know.
5,Boa compra,"Para quem está comeando a praticar, esse livro com cd é uma excelente escolha. Eu no toco nenhum instrumento e com um pouco de esforo já consigo tirar algumas músicas. Dica: siga as lies de acordo com o livro, é surpreendente como aos poucos uma nota que parecia impossível de ser tirada logo é tocada com naturalidade. Compre sem medo."
5,It Works,"I spent a couple of hours a day for one week with this book and the DVD preparing for the MPRE. I scored a 91 on the test. Especially for the money, it's a very good last minute preparation aid that works."
5,"Larry and Bob, give us another CD SOON!","This mix of Jazz with music from other cultures is as effective and interesting as anything The Pat Metheny Group has done. The vibe work was superb, especially on ""You Dig"". Several cuts, such as ""Spellbound"" have a bolder than usual, yet not overbearing, bass line tying everything together. Fantastic guitar and sax throughout. Cudos to Voodoo Dogs for keeping most tracks upbeat....""smooth jazz"" listeners beware, this may not be for you. I'm ordering four more copies as Christmas gifts. Too bad this isn't a double CD."
3,Blinded by the light?,"I read most Thoreaux novels for the travel writing; he is an expert in the field and has successfully mixed travel with other topics to great success. I started Blinding Light with great expectations for the same--and was not disappointed. But 2/3 of the way through I finally had to put it down. The sex, although well-written and at times graphic, became the stuff of adolescent fantasy. Not to say it was bad, but it took up far too much space and was just not necessary.I am not a sex-snob by any means, and feel sex of any kind is a welcome part of good fiction (but not sex for sex sake). But Mr. Thoreaux takes things a bit too far this time around. When I sit down with a book, I like each sitting to bring a new setting/situation into play and this just did not happen."
2,fatally flawed from the outset,"I've only just picked up BLINDING LIGHT so am conscious I have little original to say buT I am squarely with those who think that Theroux must have been competing for the annual bad sex award. The descriptions are embrassingly absurd but, more important, unnecessary. After 50 pages I had had enough of it and was struck by the absence of any likeable characters. This was my first Theroux novel and I can't belive his reputation is built on stuff like this .. ""blinding light"", hardly the most creative pun given the plot's predictable development."
1,Incredible disappointment,"Easily the worst book Theroux has ever written. The story telling and prose is OK, but the plot, such as it is, is absurd, the super graphic sex unnecessary, the metaphors far-fetched, the smug disguised egocentrism is painful, the imagining limited and creaky. I've loved Theroux for many years and labored through 2/3 of the book out of respect. But what a monumental failure! Interesting only to see how a great writer can be so wrong about himself, but why did a publisher buy this? is obviously they knew PT's fans would expect more and pay anything for the promise. Pray for the regeneration of Theroux's skills and literary soul."
2,i am still waiting for the item to be shipped,"i bought this item on september 5, 2010 and still it says waiting to be shipped. it did not say on the item that there would be any delays on the shipping and i have sent 3 emails regarding the status and no reply, none whatsoever, i think i bought an item with this merchant awhile back and i think i got it fast but i need to know whats going on with the item i bought. any reply would be helpful since i am not getting any replies with me emailing them."
1,miracle,"THIS ,WAS A TOTALLY FIASCO,THE ORIGINAL AROMA OF MIRACLE BY LANCOME,IS UNFORGGETTABLE,BUT PRODUCT THAT WAS SENT TO ME WAS JUST A FAKE I'WILL NEVER BUY AGAIN ANY PERFUME ONLINE, IT WAS A VERY BAD IDEA.I THINK THE NAME OF THE COMPANY WHERE I GOT IT FROM WAS,SOFT PINK OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT."
4,JVC-RQ-CW350 HIGH POWER CD BOOMBOX,I PURCHASED THIS FOR MY WIFE. IT REPLACES AN OLDER MODEL. SHE WANTED ANOTHER JVC JUST LIKE THE ONE SHE HAD. SHE LOVES IT.
2,"The ""Owl"" trilogy limps to a close","While this book offers some interesting description, its problem is that there is no suspense, conflict, or action to speak of. Any possible conflict between characters or threat to them is resolved so quickly that the reader doesn't even have a chance to start wondering about it. While I enjoy a book that has some quiet moments and introspection, ""Owlknight"" is almost all quiet moments and introspection, which makes it very dull.""Owlknight"" is definitely below Lackey's usual standards. She knows how to make a book interesting and have a good balance between action and introspection. One wonders what happened with ""Owlknight.""The first book in the series, ""Owlflight,"" was quite good. The second, ""Owlsight,"" was somewhat lacking in action, but sometimes that happens in the middle of a trilogy. However, one expects the third book to have a rousing climax, not limp along from one pat solution to another, as ""Owlknight"" did."
3,"a decent read, but one of lackey's weakest books","The Owl series started off strong and remained interesting through Owlsight, but Owlknight is weak. The plot is much thinner, the main characters act/think in ways inconsistent with their earlier development. Lackey often has a bit of a moralistic tone (diversity is good, tolerance is good, etc). Nothing wrong with that, and it usually works well, but here it comes across as preachy.Until the last 50 pages of the book, everything goes basically without hitch for Darian and friends -- where are the conflicts and intensity of writing of ""The Last Herald Mage""??Don't get me wrong, I'm a major fan of Mercedes Lackey, and have read (and own!) just about every one of her works and collabarations. I strongly recommend Owlflight, and Owlsight is a good follow-on, but get Owlknight in paperback, and only if you've read and enjoyed the first two Owl books."
4,Enjoyable story but a weak ending,"A Herald-Mage is sent to Errol's Grove, with Shandi as his assistant. Newly-knighted Darian uses his newly-won Master powers to search for his parents, who disappeared years earlier. He and several of his friends set out on a quest into unknown lands and strange dangers.The title of this book is certainly relevant to the story! Solid storytelling as usual, but with one surprising, major loose end left at the end of the book. Lackey isn't usually that sloppy, unless she is planning a fourth book in the series. Shandi and Karles do not come up to the measure of previous Herald/Companion pairs, but the rest of the characters are both believable and likable."
3,No full page artwork!,"With this book, many loose ends are tied neatly. I felt that it could have been better, it wasn't as good as some of her older books. And for those of you who didn't want any more barbarians...tough luck."
3,Not Enough Depth,"I have just finished this book and while it is interesting and concludes the story of Darian and his lost family I feel that Lackey's work has lost depth. Her previous books have all been quite complex with twists in character developmenteg. Leareth/Falconsbane connection and this one was just more childish. If the others were aimed at readers in their late teens/adults, then this one was for lower teens. Obviously Lackey cares for the money now and not for the story."
3,"Fine music, terrible sound","This CD was recorded at a club (I think; liner notes are not informative) in Munich in 1961. It features McCoy Tyner on piano, Reggie Workman on bass and Mel Lewis on drums. Ingredients are promising, no? Unfortunately, whoever made the recording seems to have been sitting right next to the drums and bass, because Dolphy is virtually drowned out much of the time. What can be heard of his playing is top-notch as usual, but you have to strain your ears to convince yourself it's not just the McCoy Tyner piano trio (which would be OK, but I paid for Dolphy). I'm no audiophile but this is bad even by my low standards. Five stars for the music, zero stars for the sound."
1,Very thin and flimsy,"This the second set I ordered, as I am organizing my entire CD collection. and I wish I knew which brand I ordered last time, because the quality difference was HUGE. These were very thin and flimsy. You could practically see through the paper. When filed among the other ones, they appear almost bunched up, rather than crisp and clean like the others. I intend to buy some more of a better quality and replace these. They will go in the trash, which is where they belong. Spend the few pennies more for a better product. You won't regret it."
3,Does The Job,"Product feels cheap. Very thin paper. BUT .. it does what it's supposed to, protect the disk. Not sure if I would again, I'll have to wait to see if they fall apart."
2,product was short,Items arrived fairly quick pkg undamaged but both were short total short around 50 or so sleeves so my loss...
1,THE Worst Sleeves I've Ever Purchased,"These are the worst cd/dvd sleeves I've ever purchased. I go through a lot of sleeves, I've probably gone through several hundred this year. I ran out of my usual sleeves and was in a rush to purchase more. I get 2 day shipping with Amazon, so gave these a try... what a mistake. They're incredibly cheap and flimsy, beyond what I expected. The sleeves I usually buy are priced the same and are made of 80g paper, so I thought I'd be getting a similar product, but that wasn't the case."
4,Like computer supplies,I have trouble finding DVD rewritable discs and the protective papers. These look like they will work well for what I need. I'm glad Amazon has them.
3,Some Came Damaged,"I ordered four packs of these and at least one of them came with several of the sleeves slightly cut in the flap. It was very strange and not what I was hoping for, but I'm just using them for long-term storage, so it really didn't affect their use for me. Other than that I have nothing to report--pretty simple product, after all."
2,A Case Of Trying Too Hard,"Although I thoroughly enjoyed the ""The Remarkable Miss Frankenstein,"" I can not say the same for ""The Reluctant Miss Van Helsing."" Correct me if I'm wrong but shouldn't a romance novel contain some romance. Asher's constant lascivious thoughts about Jane made me feel dirty given his obvious contempt for her. It is unfortunate that the author felt the need to beat the reader over the head with Jane's lack of external beauty as if we are too stupid to grasp the simple concept. Did that fact truly need to be reiterated 5 or 6 times in each chapter by everyone she came in contact with. We get it; she's not beautiful, and she's not considered worthy to be with Asher nor is she considered worthy to be a Van Helsing. Also, the author seemed overly concerned with getting laughs that quickly became extremely irritating. I mostly just felt very sad for Jane's part in a verbally abusive life."
4,"Wonderful acting, touching movie","Gena Rowlands and Marisa Tomei star in this wonderful movie about two generation helping each other out through life lessons and love. Rowlands is a lonely lady who helps Tomei watch her little boy, and with that Rowlands comes alive again and the boy brings new meaning to her life. Jake Lloyd plays the little boy and he will tug at your heart strings so perfectly. Superbly acted by these fine Oscar winning ladies, this little-known movie is worth it. Sometimes funny, sad, touching, and honest, it tells the truth about what people can do for one another if we are not afraid to give it a try and look beyond ourselves. Unhook the Stars, be real to yourself and those around you, and don't be afraid to give it a chance."
4,Very good movie,This is a good movie about real life. It is worth watching and yes I would recommend this movie to others.
5,The best source if information for you and your bird,"If you are a parrot owner then look no further for a guide that covers everything from care to behavior to health. I have used this book for my 10 years of bird parenting and found it to be indispensable. Following the information in this book truly does help you ""to create the best companion parrot possible."""
5,Sally Blanchard is a THIEF and CON ARTIST!,"This is a Great Book. The finest ever published on Parrot Behavior.However, the Author and her company CPQ are Con Artists and Thieves.They sold hundreds of subscriptions to their expensive magazine ""Companion Parrot Quarterly.""Most of the subcribers, including myself, recieved one or NO issues. In two years, not one issue was ever published and recieved. CPQ never answered any inquiries and the subscribers never got a single penny back.AND Blanchard kept selling subscriptions and pocketing money!This is a scandal and I understand that complaints have been filed with the Colorado Attorney General.If you don't believe me, check the internet. Anyway, only buy this Book from Amazon. NEVER Send any money to Blanchard or CPQ...you will recieve nothing."
4,"Highly recommened, but needs more health details","This book is a very good primer for the new bird owner. I would have liked a little more detailed health information, perhaps including some professional photos instead of just the drawings. It's primary strength is the behavioral info,which is, of course, Sally Blanchard's field of expertise."
5,Very eye opening,"This book examines the 6 ""clobber"" passages in the bible towards GLBT people, as well as discusses several same sex relationships also in the bible. I think both sides of this debate should read this book, praying that the truth within would be revealed to the reader."
3,"Excellent, a must have for beginners.","Scott Landis covers all the basics and more, offering many ideas for workbench design and construction technique. The pictures in this book alone make it a coffee table quality book."
2,Not a reference guide and not a WPF novel... but the worst technical book I've ever bought...,"Despite the positive reviews from members of the WPF team (talking about being biased), this is one of the worst technical books I've bought in a long time. Petzold states that you should see this book as a WPF novel, but to me it's a very boring novel. After reading the first couple of chapters, I just put this book aside: not a single screenshot or image(!) and too much talk about all kinds of brushes in the first chapter. This book is NOT written for modern developers who want to get started with WPF as quick as possible...[added] For me it was such a releave to read 'WPF unleashed' written by someone who really understands how WPF-concepts should be explained!"
4,Well written,"This book explains WPF in a very simple manner. Petzold has hundreds of examples and progressively builds upon the previous examples to show more and more complex scenarios. As other people found, the lack of pictures made it harder for me to understand what the author was trying to explain. Also, the Code and XAML are covered in two separate sections, which makes it harder to make the connection. But definitely a book to have in your collection."
2,Poor construction,"My spouse had a herbal neck wrap many years ago. She had gotten the wrap from her mother and it helped her disc induced neck pain. During the years and after many military moves, the wrap was lost. I ordered the Herbal Concepts Comfort Neck Wrap. Within one week, the bottom seam came unsewn, requiring immediate repair. It was caught in time, and repaired before the herbal contents spilled out. After repair, the wrap worked perfectly. Lack of attention to detail to its manufacture resulted in poor construction."
3,"it OK, but other one is better","i bought this one and the Anti-Stress Microwavable Neck Pillow 8.75""x7"" (light green), and compared. they are very similar, but i like the light green one better, the quality and feel of it is nicer. I think they smell about the same. I dont think the smell is as bad as some people say.."
5,Cheese!,My teeth weren't a yellow shade but they definitely weren't white. This got them noticeably whiter after 3 uses. It does make your teeth a little sensitive after the first few times but I got used to it.
2,"Works well, but...",These strips DO whiten your teeth but it doesn't come easy. After a few days I developed an awfully sore throat and my teeth are very sensitive. Crest says the sensitivity is normal and will go away but this sore throat is enough to make me want to give up. Vanity at a price
3,Don't Believe the Hype,"Please don't think that using this product will cause you to get cavities. That is rediculous. This product does nothing to remove enamel. If it removed enough enamel to give you cavities, like one reviewer said it did, you would be in pain from sudden sensitivity before worrying about cavities. Ludicrous. I'm not saying how effectively it whitens teeth, because I haven't used it."
5,a different kind of mystery,"This book is unusual in we get a quick idea of who the killer is (due to an alibi that is too perfect), and we spend all the time trying to prove it. We even get a court scene, which I really enjoyed. Lots of good action at a sleazy motel too. And Mark Sloan does a good job in finally trapping the killer. A first rate mystery!"
5,Roadmap to Reunion,"How gratifying to hear these artists express the magic and swift journeying of this wonderful little book. It's almost like being in Mother's lap and hearing her read your favorite book, but with a very very talented mother and a script of mystic travel through the valleys we must travel daily. I leave it on the player for hours, because unlike much ""mystical"" work today, which connects the author with your money, The Seven Valleys is, Baha'is believe, the Word of God, nourishment for the true self."
4,A brilliant and challenging reading,"I do highly recommend this book to those who are interested in a balance and complete discussion of issues such as abortion, capital punishment and same sex relationships. A brilliant and challenging reading!!!!"
1,Possibly the WORST attempt at humorous writing I have read,"I bought a copy of ""Don't Name Your Baby"" after reading a positive review of it in the Sun Times. I was extremely disappointed to see how poorly written it was. The author's idea of being funny is to put an ""R"" in front of names that start with an ""A"" (i.e. Agatha = Ragatha, Agnes = Ragnes).He states that the name Steven/Stephen implies an obvious lack of talent and sites Stephen King as one of his examples. Stephen King's 8th grade writing essays are Nobel Prize winners compared."
3,"Nice Book to Read Anytime of Day - a review of ""Jafta""","This is a nice little book to read to small children that still have trouble finding words to express themselves. I mean who hasn't felt cross and wanted to ""stamp like an elephant"" or ""grumble like a warthog"".I certainly have felt like that, and I'm sure my children have too. [In fact, recently when we are out-of-sorts we did just that - stomped like elephants- until we fell down laughing like hyenas.]But there is more here than that. Jafta nuzzles and wallows and swings from trees. See below for sample text:When I get tired, I like lazing in the sun like a lizard,or wallowing warm like a hippo,and feeling cuddly like a lamb.And,Sometimes I want to be as tall as a giraffe,as long as a snake.And I want to run as fast as a cheetah,as quick as an ostrich ...Three Stars. [C+]. My children like the simple artwork in browns and creams that Jafta and the animals he `felt' like. They also liked that they could act out their feelings using animals."
5,Another winner from Gooseberry Patch!,"I love love love Gooseberry Patch books! I received this and immediately sat down to read through the whole thing. This week, I've planned my family meals around the cookbook and every night this week, my two guys are demolishing the meals - they love them!"
2,Disappointing,"Online this ring looks great, but in person it is disappointing. I have small hands (size 5) and while it is obviously a dainty ring, the teeny stones made it look like children's jewelry. The prongs are the only metal that is visible when you wear it, so looking down at it you can't appreciate that the ring is made of 3 different colors. Based on the other reviews I took a chance and I don't want anyone else to make the same mistake. I've returned the ring and am looking forward to picking out something else. Amazon as usual made the return process very easy!"
5,Fabulous pictures and details,This is the book that you want to get. Its got all the details; is easy to read and follow; annotated the way you like. You really can't go wrong with this book.
4,Cirque Du Soleil is theater and magic.,"I love Varekia i have the sound track and the dvd, Cirque is pure magic and theater combined, very true to the art form of entertainment. excellent story, magical characters, breath taking feats, beautiful costuming ,superb in all sense of the word one of the best i have ever seen, i can't wait to actually see Cirque Du Soleil live!"
3,Atención MEXICO y Latinoamérica,"Compré este DVD en una tienda de discos en México (perdón Amazon!) y desgraciadamente a la edición (R4) para Latinoamerica le faltan 5 de los 8 extra-features que se prometen en la portada de esta edición.Es una verdadera pena que este tipo de espectáculos se vean empañados por una edición tan mediocre; la misma no tiene mucha información técnica, los extras no son buenos.El Cirque du Soleil sigue tan bueno como siempre pero este no es uno de sus mejores espectáculos.Sugiero que compren Saltimbanco, Alegría y/ó Quidam.Muy mal por Columbia Video y la producción de SONY."
3,men's shoes,"alright fit just a little too narrow,i am hoping with wear they will stretch out. other than that, the product arrived on time as Amazon stated. I purchase clothes shoes, house hold products on amazon and recommend amazon to everyone."
5,One Job Search Book for Everyone!,"Can it be almost 20 years since Kate Wendleton published this? At the time, I said rather publicly, ""This is the best job search book I have ever read."" It remains so.The most important point about Brick Wall is that it outlines strategies and suggests tactics that will work for C-level executives AND for graduates looking for their first job and, yes, for everybody in between. If you're looking at all of the books available on job search and wondering, ""Which of these is for people at my level?"" the answer is ""This one!""FYI--For over 20 years, I made my living coaching people in the midst of job searches."
5,Winning Chess,This is a classic. So much so that I wanted to find a copy based on a discussion of how useful it was in the earliest days learning chesss skills. Recommended if you can find it; cherish it if you have a copy.
4,"nice tin, don't know what's in it","I thought the puzzle in the tin would be similar to the ""Disney"" and stars on the outside. The two puzzles inside are not stated in the tin's description. One is a lion king puzzle and one is a sleeping beauty puzzle."
2,The negative reviews are unfortunately true,"This is a big step backward from the 2 previously great Stronghold games. The graphics are indeed an unnecessary distraction, the bugs and gameplay lag really drag the game down, and there was simply no reason for such an extreme makeover when the gameplay in the earlier games was so simple, straightforward, customizable and fun. It's very difficult to play this game now with any degree of control, which is about the worst thing you can say about a RTS game. What a shame.***For the reviewer who suggested that we patch the game and then try it again ""to be fair"" I patched it out of the box before playing it and before this review. It ran so badly with the patch I can't imagine how it performed without it."
5,What i expected.,"I gave this game an overall score of 5 out of 5. The reason i gave it that score? It is because i have play stragedy games before like Age of Empires 3 and there all about fighting. In this game you get the best of both worlds of how to control a real nation. Economic and Warfare, you must sustain your colony from hating you and fend off the enemies trying to kill you. I agree it is difficult in the beginning learning how the buildings work, Guard Post, Court House etc. Once you get use to it you will learn to love and really feel your people are working hard to make you proud. This game is great and im still playing it, and a phenomenal story line. Great Job!5 out of 5Thanks,Ana Jorge."
3,Grandioso,"El juego esta fantastico, solo es que debes de tener mucha memoria de sobra en tu computadora por que sino no vas a poder disfrutar el maximo de las graficas, pero aun asi esta tan bien detallado que me parece increible que FIREFLY alla podido recrear con exactitud la epoca medieval tanto en cultura como en sociedad."
1,very disappointed,"I really like strategy games and managing an economy, and I was excited to try this game since it was described as a ""castle sim."" Unfortunately, the controls are clunky and it runs very badly on my computer. It crashes a lot and there are many annoying graphics bugs. I wish I had listened to the other reviewers and skipped this one."
1,coastfire,This game is more of the same if you own Crusader or Stronghold. The major difference of the aformentioned games is that they are playable. Stonghold 2 has many problems the major one is the constant lockup or freezing of game play. Don't waste your money.
1,DO NOT BUY THIS GAME,"Dear friends, this game is not worth one cent. As a fan of ""classic"" games such as Sid Meier's Colonization, Centurio, Transport Tycoon Deluxe or AOE I-II, I find Stronghold 2 just plain awful. I have spent only one day with this game, the necessary time to jump into the conclusion that Stronghold 2 is a shame.Idiotic voices of the characters, terrible graphics, pathetic scenarios, awful layouts, boring battle, etc. I don't even know where to start. There is NOTHING worth to waste five minutes with this game. I am so disappointed with Stronghold 2. I cannot understand how there are people who like it. I have been ripped off."
5,Stronghold 2,"I love this game. So many different quests and different ways to play. I am disappointed that after purchasing the game it was still version 1 and not one with the updates. Therefore, runtime errors occur. Downloading the updates cause a .dll file to go missing. But still a really good game to play."
3,warning..............,Just to let everyone know....this has to be downloaded from a computer....It is not ready to go when you order this and it arrives..My 6 year old was very disappointed when she could not watch her movie right away.......This should be informed on the description of the product from amazon......shame shame.....I won't order movies from here again....
5,"Another great fun, historical and educational movie!","This is a really fun movie. Our entire family has enjoyed watching it (including Dad!). The music in this movie is perfect for the era too.This is a great movie that includes things like ""hoboes"" and foreclosures. Ironically, this is a GREAT movie about some of the things that kids are dealing with in 2009/2010.It talks about soup kitchens, jumping trains, and even saving left-overs. Kit is a real trouper and deals with the depression era really well considering all that she goes through. It talks about important things like the CCC which was an important part of history.This is such a fun movie with a great ending. Highly recommend it!"
1,Keep the lights on!,"This book is a magnificent compilation of stories including at least two that were made into movies. Hark, who goes there became ""The Thing."" The original and the remake were both based on the story but only the remake came close to the story. ""A boy and his dog"" was also made into a movie starring a young Don Johnson. All the other stories are gripping as well."
5,Everything as expected,"Although a little smaller than I thought, the quality and craftmanship everthing as promised. Very satisified with this product."
5,Look at it,"Somehow, I missed the part Black and White when I ordered it. Moreover compared to other photo books, the size is little small. So two disappointments from the very beginning but when I 'Look at it' I think it is worth looking, time and money both are well spend. It bears the message: photography is an art not just taking snapshots; and it does its work very very well.I have no idea about printing but whatever they did to their printing is great. The images are so vibrant it is hard to resist touching those images. I liked it very very much!!!"
4,Light Holiday Reading,"I enjoyed this book by Barbara Bretton. It was a light and fun holiday read. Charlie is a short order cook who tries to help out driven, somewhat uptight Caroline in her store. They are complete opposites yet attracted to each other and they end up getting locked in the store's vault. They find out that their one night together has consequences and the book follows their relationship after that. It was a sweet non demanding holiday read. I will definitely check out this author again."
3,ok read,"This book is dated, 1980s is my guess due to the Vietnam war reference and the walkman. It was assumed the reader would get the logical flow for why they had to marry and I dont. also, the author cannot keep track of her story. the due date is once on Jan 22 and them later its on Mar 31st. The h doesnt eat pork cause its unsanitary but has no issue with bacon. If these types of story issues dont bother you, this is an enjoyable read. Characters are demensional and likeable."
1,Quite dillusional,Cannot believe he talks of Shawshank Redemption so poorly! Does not know a good heartfelt movie when he sees one. Possibly burnt out from seeing so many he has become quite dillusional.
1,Very Rude,I think this guy is very rude. He doesnt know what a real movie is. He said that The Nutcracker by Pacific Northwest Ballet was annoying! Well I hope he knows he is to.
3,Flawed but worthwhile reference book,"Is it just me or is everyone getting a little bit too worked up over this book? It's a video reference guide, for crying out loud. I frequently disagree with Mr. Maltin's reviews but I buy his book every year along with others, all of which I find useful in their own ways. Maltin does skimp on the Index (Videohound is the best for this) and his BOMB to **** rating system is maddeningly inconsistent. But he is extremely thorough, and let's face it - it's all subjective anyway and just meant to be fun."
2,Not very useful,"This book is probably more than enough if one is looking for a quick reference on mainstream American movies. I used to buy it every year until I noticed that the guide wasn't really helpful regarding anything that lied beyond mainstream or the middlebrow conception of ""family entertainment"". When I realized this, it became very easy for me to predict Maltin's ratings well in advance, so there was no point in buying his book anymore. I find ""Variety Film Guide"" more useful as a source for plot synopses and ""Time Out Film Guide"" more well-informed and insightful."
4,"Everybody's a critic, but some get paid for it","I've purchased Leonard Maltin's book annually as long as I can remember and find it to be an invaluable resource. I am a fan of Mr. Maltin's, and find his reviews to be interesting, well-thought out and, occasionally, hilarious. That he gets blasted by some for his reviews is amusing; all criticism is ultimately subjective. Because he doesn't like 'Blade Runner' doesn't make him an idiot; I didn't like it, either! The best film critics give the prospective viewer enough information to draw their own conclusions from the criticism; Mr. Maltin and Roger Ebert are both experts at this. I highly recommmend books by either of these film critics."
3,Useful guide; 1999 edition better than 2000,You can use this guide for a quick summaries and ratings although many entries receive too much praise. This edition is better than the 2000 edition because it contains lists of films by selected directors.
2,"Just for the data, forget the opinions.","Unfortunately this is the only consolidated source of data on recent films. The opinions offered by the editor and staff are more predictable than a B movie. For them a ""great movie"" is a famous, profound (whatever that means!) and/or ethnically correct movie. Not a drop of insight and even less originality. They could be reviewing theater plays. Its reedeming(?) quality is the enormous list. Not much in terms of old or foreign films, but still a reference one can turn to in case of need."
1,Biased against Ridley Scott!!!!!,"I posted a review of this piece of trash a few months ago and since then I have learnt two important points about this book. First is that the writers are biased against one of the best directors of all time: Ridley Scott, the director of Alien, Blade Runner, Thelma and Louise and 1492: Conquest of Paradise. He might have got away with it if he had simply slated all his films, like he has, but he discredited Alien for its violence, yet loved the sequel that was directed by James Cameron, yet was infinately more violent!!! Secondly Maltin has clearly failed to reach pubety, (that beard on his mug shot on the cover has to be a fake!!), since he lacks all vision and slates brilliant, adult classics for their violence like Taxi Driver, which he called sick!! I BEG YOU NOT BUY THIS BOOK! INFACT ONE STAR DRASTICALLY OVER RATES IT!!!!!"
5,IT GROWS ON YOU!,"When I first watched this movie a couple years ago, I HATED IT! But then a couple of friends and me at my school wanted to do a spoof on Black History Month, so we started German History Month- which is during the month of March- and I told my friends about ""SPRINGTIME FOR HITLER"" and they started cracking up! So I went with my sister down to the library, and we checked it out and watched it again, and we were rolling on the floor laughing! I even downloaded ""Springtime For Hitler"" from Napster! This movie is so funny! The characters are a riot! It's like the biggest inside joke now for us, and it's just hilarious! This is Mel Brooks' BEST MOVIE! If anyone is the mood for a laugh, get this movie- it's a crack up, and it might not seem funny at first, but trust me- it grows on you!"
5,Never fails!,You'd think after all these years a crack pot comedy like this would run its course and be dated. But it isn't. It's still laugh out loud funny and perfect to watch a dreary Sunday in February.
3,The Producers,"Has been many years since I saw The Producers in the movie theatre, & I guess my memory of it was slightly flawed. It seemed to lack much of what needed to be present, to develop the plot more effectively. Seemed to rush through all kinds of events, without any coherence. But maybe thats just me, a 21st century man trying to apply todays logic to a video of an old movie"
2,Disappointing,"Mel Brooks, Zero Mostel, and Gene Wilder are great comedians. I've always heard great things about this movie. As a result, I'd waited years to see it. It's a real letdown. Every scene is built around one joke. These jokes are often funny, but long after the viewer gets it the scene will go on and on to milk every possible aspect of the joke. Eventually this gets tedious.Of course lots of people really like this movie. I recommend renting it or catching it on cable before buying the video."
4,one of the funniest movies ever,"This is a great film which is relitively forgotten in todays world, but it is easily a classic that should not be missed. Gene Wilder and Zero Mostel click so well as theiving producers out to make a million on a ""flop"" called ""Springtime for Hitler."" Gene Wilder discovers that, through creative accounting, a producer can make more money with a flop then they can with a hit. And the fun goes from there. Rent or buy this video when it becomes available."
5,This gem of a cookbook.,"I simply couldn't believe that anyone hadn't already reviewed and raved about Paula Wolfert's Cooking of S-W France. More than a cookbook, Wolfert takes us on a journey through one of the most wonderful regions of French cuisine. Written in an intelligent and passionate manner, she provides all the classics and adds many other recipes and insights collected during her travels through the region. If you adore french country cuisine, and you haven't seen this book already, you've missed something! Together with Jeanne Strang's ""Goose fat and Garlic"", I would rate this in my top ten French cookery books."
1,Outrageous!,"This is a bad follow-up to the original Shrek. It does the name of Dreamworks entertainment injustice to call this an actual movie. The story is awful, so is the dialouge. I feel this is one of the worst cartoon I have ever seen since The Lion King. The original Shrek was a good enough movie, nothing to go nuts over, but funny just the same. But this.... is just too much for me to bear. Dreamworks should close down after making this horrible movie. What a sellout! The Amaerican movie industry should hide it's face in shame after turning out this piece of garbage."
2,changed ending,I do not like the new ending. I prefered the one in the movie where the dragon comes back to Donkey. If I had known this was cut out I would not have bought the DVD.
2,"Excellent MOVIE, Horrible DVD","I agree with the other reviewers about the 10 minute advertising you are FORCED to watch everytime single time you start the DVD. It is bad enough that Dreamworks would put this material to play at the start of the DVD, but to disable my ability to SKIP it if I don't wish to see it??? That, as far as I am concerned, is a demonstration of pure contempt for it's customers by Dreamworks. I will avoid purchasing future Dreamworks DVDs."
4,Shrek 2 opinion,"Shrek 2 was as good if not better than the first. It is a great kids cartoon movie. It also has enough content to keep adults not only occupied but entertained. It is a commedy that anyone can enjoy if looking for a good laugh. The characters are well rounded and they have personality. These characters are believable. The aimation in the movie is amazing. It is hard to imagine how this was all put together. Not many people think about that aspect of it, but being an artist I can't help but notice it. Everything looks so real. This world is so believable and just adds to kids imagination."
1,Inexcusably bad menu system,"The buttons for accessing the DVD menu system are disabled. You can't even use the ""Skip Chapter"" button. In addition to the normal copyright warning, you are also forced to watch 10 minutes commercials for other DreamWorks pictures. I am not a Luddite that doesn't know how to use a DVD player... the functionality really is disabled. I took the time to write this review for the express purpose of convincing you not to buy this disc. This behavior must be punished."
1,Shrek 2 NOT for Children,"Parents! Parental warning: There are transvestites, sexual humor, and Pinocchio wearing women's thong underwear. If you don't mind your kids seeing the above than you could consider this a four star movie. Humor on the level of many Simpsons episodes.To be fair, the computer animation was wonderful in this sequel. I enjoyed this movie, but was embarrassed to have my children see some sections of the film. Any animated/computer animated film that will obviously draw in a large audience of children should be a little more considerate of the age groups that will watch it."
3,Beware of the advertisments,Delightful movie but be prepared to spend 15 minutes of viewing previews for other movies before the main feature. The producer of this DVD has fixed it so fast forward doesn't work so every time you play this DVD you HAVE to watch the other previews.
2,Could have been WAY better!,"The most waited sequel was a (...) bomb. I really did not like it. That's the reason I hate animated sequels: there's always a cheap musical number. That's what made me not like this movie. If you wnat comedy, watch the first one. That one is way better"
5,The Perfect Movie,"This movie is flawless. A rare movie that is even better than the Original. I love this movie, and the ending was great too. Donkey is funnier than ever, Puss N' Boots is the best new character, and Shrek is still Shrek!"
1,Good movie but phooey on the forced commercials,"Yes, this was a good movie, but this DVD forces you to sit through two other Dreamworks' coming attractions before you get the main menu, which is *totally* obnoxious! You can't fast forward through them, nor can you hit the Main Menu button on your remote and dump them that way. Disney DVDs are front-loaded with commercials as well, but if you hit Main Menu you get the main menu and you can bypass them. On this puppy, you are stuck. Someone in Dreamworks' marketing department thought this was a good idea, but I am giving this DVD a low rating soley for this enforced waste of my time!"
4,Great for adults and older children-maybe not tots,"I bought this DVD because I thoroughly enjoyed Shrek, and my four year old son loves movies. He'd been asking me to replay The Cat in the Hat over and over, and if you've ever seen that stinker, you know why I was in a hurry to buy a new movie.I love this film. It's witty, original and full of surprises. There just isn't enough action to keep a younger child engaged. Most of the excitement comes from the very mature and well-developed plot, not the animation (which is also outstanding).As far as the PG rating goes, I didn't see anything too inappropriate. I've seen racier jokes on the Disney Channel."
5,Shrek 2,"After watching both Shreks, I realized that the second movie is much more interesting and funny than the first one. Maybe it's because the Shrek 2 is more socialized - there are plenty of interesting characters apart from Shrek, Fiona and a donkey. There are interesting parents of Fiona, there is a funny cat, a Prince Charming and his fabulous mother. And also the story develops in the city and you can see and hear lots of other people around, be it in a street, a pub or a royal court. In my opinion, seeing a human community (Shrek 2) is much more heart-warming than seeing a wood (Shrek 1), don't you think so?"
4,video,Very entertaining for my grand daughter. She loves Shrek and it is a great movie for small children. She has all three Shrek movies.
3,"Funny, but nearly as funny as the first","I have seen all 3 Shrek movies. By far the first one is the best. This one does have its amusing moments, but not quite the same caliber as the first. I really did not enjoy the third installment. However, my children love all three. It does have a few questionable comments in the movie aimed for adult humor, but for the most part it is an okay kids movie."
3,"Heartfelt, but dull","""Shrek 2"" suffers mightily from sophmore slump. The bloom is definitely off the rose as far as the look is concerned; been there, done that, you know. And the first half-hour or so is completely devoid of humor. Everyone yells, everyone bickers and it isn't until the arrival of the ridiculously hilarious Puss-in-Boots (Bravo Bandares!) that the film starts to pick up some steam. Ultimately its heart is in the right place (thus the 3 stars instead of 2), but ""Shrek 2"" is decidely a rental, not a buy. (And what's with all the lousy songs?)"
1,Great movie! Gets -4 Stars for HORRIBLE DVD,"You can't avoid the commercials at the beginning! It won't allow the ""skip"" or ""menu"" buttons to work on the remote, the only thing you can do is fast forward through them. I paid for this because I would like to watch it multiple times and every time you put the DVD in, you have to watch 4 minutes of ads for ""new"" Dreamworks cartoons (one is Shark Tail, already out in theaters). Idiotic, and if they keep doing this, no matter how good their movies are I will never buy another Dreamworks DVD again."
3,pretty good in spots,"this film has some moments mainly because Eddie Murphy&also some of the visuals,but on a whole it's not as strong as the first.i enjoyed the scenes&the way the flow&pacing of the film,but it just was missing something fo rme but still it has it's moments."
1,HOW DARE YOU DREAMWORKS !!!!!!!!!!!!!,I WILL NEVER BUY FROM DREAMWORKS AGAIN AFTER DISABLING MY REMOTE TO SEE THERE PREVIEWS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE DVD I OWN !!!!!!!! DON'T ENCOURAGE THIS PRATICE BY NOT BUYING THIS MOVIE.
4,lots of fun,"a delightful visionary work that features a lovable cast of characters that often prove surreal as well as very human. Among the family friendly films out there, this one presents plenty of visual treats and humor to hold adult attention. The soundtrack is pretty groovy, too."
4,Really durable and a good learning toy,"We gave this to our baby around 4 months, and she could just barely figure out how to turn it on. As the weeks went by she has gotten much better at it and really enjoys making it play the songs and light up. It certainly can take a bashing without any damage at all, I think this is a terrific toy for a baby to learn hand-eye coordination and to learn about cause and effect."
4,Conflict of Laws: Hay Casebook,"Well, as far as law books go, this one is as good as any other. The Legalines guide has helped me get through this material as well as the Gilberts.Casebooks aren't exactly known for their entertainment quality - as this one is certainly no exception - but it covers the material in a thorough manner and isn't too difficult to understand.My biggest complaint is the tiny typeface used for the Notes following each case. My teacher concentrates quite a bit on these extra factoids and the tiny print is a bit of a strain on the eyes (especially at 2:00am). Otherwise, this book is pretty much exactly what you would expect from a Conflicts textbook."
5,Classically beautiful and delightfully funky,"This is some of the most inventive new Celtic music I've heard in a long time. The vocals are clear and the intonation is lovely. The mostly-electronic instrumentation adds a whole new dimension to the music without detracting from the simplicity of the traditional vocal style. I'm particularly fond of ""1,000 Deathshrouds Upon Love"" and ""The Selchie"", but the whole album is great."
1,Useless,It is utter c..p. Buy if you are looking for Acronyms orgasm. If you are after anything practical look somewhere else. What a disappointment. Can't believe it.
4,"Good Intro to Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse","I found this book to be a good introduction to Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse. The book is easy to read and organized so that the reader can cover the topics in any desired order. It also ties the technologies together by showing how they are used within a sample application. In addition, I appreciate the references for those desiring to dig down deeper into the individual tools. If you are looking for a good overview of these tools and how they fit together this is the book for you. If you are looking for a reference book on detailed APIs you probably should look elsewhere."
2,Too much title for too few content,"I bought this book because I already had the sensation that Eclipse, Spring and Hibernate were the new top-knotch combination to develop web applications. I bought it, then, expecting this book to be a practical introduction to the way they interact and they way you can actually develop a project using them. Instead, it limits itself to recognize what I have just asserted above (that this combination is indeed powerful), and to make a brief introduction (absolutely insufficient for practical purposes) to each of these technologies (and some others). So, in my opinion, this book was deceiving. Too much superficial. I read it, but I didn't learnt anything I didn't know before."
1,Half-baked,"The book fails to impress despite the rather impressive title. If you haven't bought this book yet, do yourself a favor and go to the home pages of Spring, Hibernate and Eclipse respectively, and just read the introductions. This book provides no more useful information than the individual websites' introductory pages. Moreover, the websites show better examples instead of asking you to refer to a zip file after every 10 lines or so."
1,Not as good as earlier music,"I wanted to like this CD so badly, because I loved Rick's first three CDs. But this release is nowhere near as good as that earlier music. Gone are the excellent, rambunctious honkytonk tunes and the heartbreaking ballads. This CD is nothing more than the fluffy pop crap that passes for country music."
4,Crosdressing Critique,Good book to start with I read this first before Crossdressing with Dignity and My Husband Betty. Was a great intro to set the scene for my thirst for knowing more of this phenomena within me. Chapter set out was very good and one could methodically read through and connect the thread of why we men crossdress and how best to achieve acceptance and understanding within ourselves first before we expect others to try.
3,helpful but more for newbie's,older mature crossdresser wish i had this book when first started crossdressing in my 20's i'm now 60 years old and separated from my wife because she doesn't want anything to do with jenny this book is fairly good for the beginning cd especially if he is married and hasn't come out. i recordment this and other works by Dr Peggy Rudd. has alot of good points between herself and her husband. i would recordment buying it. i hope it will open some avenues to the closet cd.
4,NOT just another repeat compilation,"Big surprises come in small packages. These are some of Jerry's greatest hits, but not the normal studio released recordings. These versions kick with a live swing orchestra...is that Harry James? Judging by Jerry's voice, these are early live recordings from the 50's. (The insert doesn't supply any recording dates.) His vocals are strong and impressive. Another surprise is ""My Heart Tells Me"", which as far as I know, has never been released by Vale in any form. For the most part this CD is pretty good. The only downside is that a couple of the songs have static in them. You would have thought that they would have digitally cleaned them up. It's still worth looking into, if for nothing else, to hear Jerry Vale with a live swing orchestra, and for the alternative versions of his hits."
2,Cheapest is not best,"The dongles were incompatible with the program with which I wanted to use it. Every other USB 2.0 dongle in the world would have worked, except this one which was the cheapest USB 2.0 dongle available. That'll teach me."
5,Great deal for mirrored aviators,I was just looking for anyone who sold some good quality sunglasses and i came across these. They come with a cool case too. The fit is perfect for my face and I am extremely satisfied with the quality and the fit.
2,Good looking sunglasses...cheap price...bad quality,"If you are expecting to have these sunglasses for a long time, you must be crazy. They are cheap for a reason...they bend, brake and scratch like nobody else's business"
3,Budget skull,"Price was good but skull is way out of alinement very rough, must of been a Friday afternoon product.For what I'm doing will work fine , duyer beware on this one."
3,Skull quality lacking,"I pray that my doctor did not use this skull in anatomy classes at medical school. It is ill fitting (top and bottom jaw) and appeared to be unglued. I don't recall this advertised as a 3 piece (plus replaceable teeth), but that is how it arrived. However, since I am not studying anatomy, it will with a little trimming and some glue, serve my purpose. I would say it was worth the $18 but not $18.01."
1,Obviously a Keys hater,"I live and work in the Florida Keys and found Ms. Williams book to be overly critical and in some cases, grossly inaccurate. Ms Williams seems to be looking to find fault instead of enjoying what is unique and wonderful about this area. Or perhaps it is easier for one to criticize than to appreciate. Ms. Williams is a fiction writer as well...perhaps this is just another work of fiction because her descriptions don't resemble the Keys I know and love."
4,Great songs and singers,"The Roach sisters' style, words, and tunes blend to produce songs that go directly to my heart and then to my mind. A great compilation of their music."
1,Poorly produced exercise video,"I've seen much better exercise videos--they didn't put much thought into this one. I'm experienced with aerobics classes and have never had such difficulty following the moves. She's difficult to follow partly because the moves change quickly, and she doesn't give cues that adequately identify the moves. Also, the videographer didn't give much tought to the task: just at the point where you need to follow the instructor's legs and feet to be sure you're with her, the camera moves so that you're seeing the participants or instructor from the waist up. Too bad--it looks like it would be a pretty good workout if one could just follow it."
2,Ehhh...,"This is the first Jude Deveraux book I ever read. I received this book as a Christmas gift, and I had never read this author before, much less the first two books of this trilogy.I was not impressed with the writing style. There's some good bits, but overall, this book failed to impress me, especially with the ending. I didn't find out that this was a trilogy until after I finished this book, but after what happens in this book, I have no desire to read the other two. I hear they're better, but after this I really have no curiosity about the other books. It was just hard to care about the characters - nothing personal against Deveraux, of course. I hear that her other books are pretty good and I might pick up one, but after reading this, I don't know."
5,Fun for the family!,"Great tape for kids and grownups alike, well-written story too. My only complaint is that it's not long enough to get my fill of sexy Kevin Sorbo's deep rich voice!"
1,Buy a different book,"There are many really excellent books on working with metal clay. This is definitely not one of them. I would give it zero stars if that was a choice. Buy a book written by: Tim McCreight, CeCe Wire, Sherri Haab, Irina Miech, MaryAnn Devos or Jeanette Landenwitch. Or, you should make sure you look through it before you buy it. Save your money and your time and avoid this book."
2,disappointed,"The book has many pretty pictures, and if all you want to do is make metal jewelry without added stones, it is probably adequate. But the thing I wanted to know most was how to set gemstones in finished metal clay jewelry, and the one paragraph devoted to that topic was singularly uninformative.For me, buying this book means having to buy another on the same topic - and hope for the best!"
1,Universal USB Charger,Unfortunately this Universal USB Car Charger turned out to be not so Universal. It does not work with a Mophie which is the supplemental battery pack for an i-Phone. I was very disappointed.
2,"Cheap and flimsy, but works","This USB car charger feels cheap and flimsy. It is also pretty long, which when combined with the cord that is plugged into it, makes it get in the way of the stick shift in my standard transmission and in the way of the gear shift in my wife's automatic transmission.Usually I have to connect it to the lighter just right and the actual phone cord has to go in just right.To it's credit, it does work when everything is set up properly, but I would probably shop around for a sturdier, less obtrusive charger. Unfortunately, I don't have any other USB Car Charges to recommend."
1,Never. Worked.,"Sucks, never worked, hated it, threw it away. Total waste of time- there are so many better products out there."
1,Bad Charger,"This was a great price, but I got what I paid for. It stopped working within a week and thought it was my Streak! Very disappointed in it."
1,"Adapter rusts, Seller does NOT respond","I purchased the--P002 : Universal USB Car Charger Adapter P002 : Universal USB Car Charger AdapterSold by: SF Planet (seller profile)Eforcity's Universal USB Car Charger Adapterand the--USB 2.0 A-B micro 5-Pin Cable, 3 FT Black USB 2.0 A-B micro 5-Pin Cable, 3 FT BlackSold by: SF Planet (seller profile)from SF Planet.The components began to rust after 90 days of normal use (plugged into a car lighter). After 180 days the components stopped working because of the accumulated rust. In the absence of moisture, a poorly designed electronic component (one designed with a bad combination of metals) will rust rapidly. I suspect this component as being poorly designed, defective.I appeal to the seller at 180 days when the components stopped working. The seller has not responded after two weeks. It my opinion that this seller SF Planet has no intention of servicing customers after Amazons 90-day feedback period, even under exceptional circumstances."
2,"Not great, but not worthless","Two problems keep me from rating this very inexpensive car USB charger higher:1. The charger that I received doesn't appear to be the same charger pictured on the product description. (eg., completely different molded body, glass tube fuse instead of plastic-encased fuse.)2. It won't charge my iPhone properly. After some testing with a multimeter, it seems the output is close to 6 VDC, despite being labeled as 5 VDC +/- 5%, which would be a max. voltage of 5.25 VDC.Overall, it's not worthless. Other less sensitive USB-powered products may be able to be charged by this."
2,Works on some devices - poor filtering,"Works on some devices but not 2nd gen Zune players (8gb, 30gb, 80gb). Worse than other USB chargers in filtering ignition static (i.e., not good for powering MP3 player while playing)."
1,Does not work,"Terrible product. Charges for 30seconds after plugged in, then stops. You must wiggle the adapter in order for charging to continue. SF Planet has been of no help after selling a garbage product."
3,well....,"good but there are much better rockers around. It complemented my etire collection and house decoration but I would go with something different next time. Doesn't rock at all, head reast it's on a small side and once baby is little bit bigger (around 3 months) it's kind of interferring with baby's head and there is no way to remove. I had different rockers in the past and could use them much longer as a seats. This one we stopped using around 3 months."
2,Cure for Gallstones?,I purchased the Gallstonex after having an ultra sound showing I could possibly have gall stones. I looked for something natural and thought I'd try the Gallstonex. To my disappointment there are no clear directions on how long to take the Gallstonex to rid yourself of gallstones. I tried taking a 2 capsules in the morning and 2 at night for a week. Not sure if it helped at all. I got back to taking Flaxseed oil capsules and I think it has helped more.
3,Footnoted to Death,"While the insight that this book provides is indeed interesting and worth reading, the overall format of the book is a burden. As most students of Crowley's literature know, his work isn't often spelled out for you line for line; here in his personal diaries, the editor tries to do just that. It gets to the point where you can find the same definition footnoted TWICE on the same page! I think this book would be much more useful about 60 pages shorter, with only the original text, maybe a footnote here or there, and the appendices are nice. It is very interesting to parallel the content here with other workings of his career at the time, it's just a chore to find your way around the book easily."
5,"Both of Hughes' novels are excellent, but this is hilarious!",I must say that this is the second novel of Langston Hughes and it greatly shows how he perfected his craft. Not that the first (Not without Laughter) wasn't good. It was level to this one except that the comedic timing is on par. I read it in 2 days and laughed all the way through. Not a waste of time.
1,"Creepy, unrealistic stalker story","Anyone who has ever been stalked will cringe at this unrealistic story of a delusional, stalking loser. Sandlin introduces us to Kelly Palomino, a dishwasher who hears voices in running water for reasons that are inadequately explored, leaving the reader to wonder why this aspect of his character was ever introduced. He falls in love at first sight with the story's equally unlikeable heroine, Colette, on her wedding day, and terrorizes her throughout this creepy nightmare of a story. The reader will shudder and wonder why as Colette seems to be slowly won over by this charmless, stubborn wierdo. The characters in ""Sex and Sunsets"" are not sympathetic or realistic, the plot is sickening to say the least, and the ending is out of sync with the real world."
3,Nice looking but collar is itchy,The sweater/jacket is nice looking. I have had many compliments on it. But I am considering pinning down the collar on each side because it bugs my neck. Also the size runssmall so I have to return mine and get a bigger one. And I'm not sure how much down is in there...feels pretty slim.
3,interesting,"Sister of darkness wasn't that great in my opinion. In the first part of the book the author jumps from different examples and memories and ages and I got lost a lot. Later on the book becomes a autobiography. Pretty cool, learning about peoples life and culture, along with the hardships passed is always interesting. I had a hard time getting through the book since it drags in lots of places with detail and because I stopped caring sometimes too."
5,A superb Historical Romance.,"Is there a better romance than an old-flame story? If you love reading about a hero and heroine with a shared past, but unfinished business, then this is definitely the book for you. Almost the first person the Marquis of Mullineaux meets on his return to England, is the one person he hoped never to see again - Lady Carberry, the woman who cruelly broke off their engagement a few years earlier. She's not too happy about the encounter either. From that point onwards they are constantly thrown together by circumstance and constantly at war with each other. This is, of course, because of their unresolved issues and ambivalent feelings towards one another - love & hate - ingredients that make a poignant romance. It deserves every one of those 5 stars, without question."
2,Not as scary as I remember,"When I was a kid this movie really scared me, but my memories of Grizzly were amplified by my childhood imagination. While there are some tense moments in this film, the good points are overshadowed by the mediocre acting and poor film quality. The DVD tranfer isn't great. The film isn't very clear and sometimes the sound fades in and out. I would recommend this film only if you really like B movie horror flicks, in that sense I enjoyed its campy quality, and the bear footage isn't half bad."
2,When good bears go bad... Bad movies are made,"When an oversized rogue bear starts hunting and killing tourists, hikers, and campers in Yellowstone National Park, it's up to park director Charlie Kittridge (Joe Dorsey) to stop him by any means possible. This doesn't sit well with a tree-hugging ranger, Christopher George (Michael Kelly), who seems to think maybe the bear could just use a little xanax and massage therapy. Old ""Smoky"" is just misunderstood, you see.Staci Layne Wilson"
3,High Class Treatment of a low budget film,"This movie's claim to fame is that it was the first out of the box to copy the successful formula of JAWS. It made quite a bit of money around the world. It's not a very good film, however. The low budget is evident in the special effects. The film does benefit from nice photography and sweeping music. The actors are competent, but the script is somewhat lacking. The timing was right for the film, and it made it's small budget back quickly.Somewhat of a cult film 30 years later, Shriek Show gives it a 2 disc special edition treatment. It includes a widescreen transfer (2.35:1), commentary by the female lead (and a moderator with a lisp!), 1976 documentary, a 30th anniversary look back, trailers, photos and ad art. Fans of this film will love the package. Most of these fans probably recall seeing the film at a drive in through their fingers."
5,GRIZZLY YOU DON'T WANT TO MESS WITH THIS BEAR!!!!!!,"Grizzly is a great flick and just like it says on the cover its Jaws,but on land!!!!! The movie is about a giant grizzly bear attacking campers in the woods!!!!!! This movie keeps you going until the end,but then again it makes you to not ever go to the woods again!!!!!! This movie is a must watched movie!!!!!"
2,7 bucks for this mouse pad !!! not worth it,"7 bucks for this mouse pad !!! not worth it alltoo expensive in my idea.it's very slim, it's made from hard slim plastic , it's not made of fabricI am used too the fabric material."
2,Don't Waste Money,This thin cheaply made pad is not worth the money. The thing feels like you could tear it but wow its the worst mousepad I have ever seen. This size is also way to small.
3,Missing a Key Phrase...,"Awesome product, really splendid idea ... unfortunately, I can only give it three stars because it is missing a most crucial catchphrase: 'I Ain't Gettin' On No Plane!'Would have been nice to have his signature laugh as well."
5,Personal Prophesy is an outstanding book,I bought this book from the authr when it first came out and loved it. The writing is personal and even just plain conversational. The information in the book is easily understandable and Personal Prophesy quickly becomes an important part of your life. I always wante dto learn how to read cards and the fact that these are regular playing cards makes the whole experience very cool. I highly recommend this for everyone who has ever wanted to feel in charge of their lives. A very good book!
5,Prime example of fantasy at it's best by a fresh new author,"After reading Mr. Ventimiglia's book, The Bloodsword Saga, I was impressed by the vast array of emotion on each page. This emotion seems to spill over from his other writings, of which I have read most. Mr. Ventimiglia has an uncanny ability to put the dark side of humanity into the written word and I look forward to many more literary contributions."
3,Good reference book,This is a good reference book. It explains what life might be like in certain star systems and what suns can support life. It has some science. It also tells you how to look at various cultures and develop your own through creative thinking and logic as well as looking at ecosystems on earth and how they could survive and develop as cultures. We really have everything here on earth that could be considered alien in one form of animal or another. This book helps you think about how and why your alien culture thinks and how it has evolved.
3,Too general to be very useful,"A&AS takes takes only a cursory and scattershot path through the subject matter. If you're hoping for specific answers to questions like ""What would a lifeform from worlds with more or less gravity than Earth's be like?"" you're bound to be disapointed. However it does succeed at giving food for though."
1,Bad News,"I guess if you need to turn a computer monitor into a pretty bad TV, this is your baby. But reading the other reviews here I expected at least a watchable picture. Nope. In my view it was muddy, bad contrast, pretty weak even by 50-year-old NTSC standards. I can't stand watching TV like this. Maybe it's OK for you?"
3,a pretty good media station,"Could anyone tell me if they got every channels shown thru the TV turner?It is because i just bought the viewbox and got everything connected. Unfortunately, i could only get few channels shown on the monitor....Did that happen to anyone?otherwise its' performance is really good."
5,best ever!!!!,"this is some bad ass stuff! i really liked this album but i think i liked elephantine aliitle more. dirty water took the cake for me so, i recomend that album over this one. but this cd still has some awsome stuff. good guitar riffs and awsome singing make this one of my fav cd's"
1,This Is An Abstinence Video But Won't Say So ...,"... whether or not you think abstinence is an effective approach to sex education, you should be concerned that this video does not forthrightly acknowledge that it is an abstinence video until after you've paid for it and started watching.The word ""abstinence"" does not appear in its Amazon discription, its title or on the box. This should be a source of concern.If you want an abstinence video, then you may as well get this one, but you have to wonder why it doesn't forthrightly acknowledge its nature.If you want a video that deals with effective means of preventing disease and pregnancy, you may prefer videos that start off with an more honest approach, such as those provided by Planned Parenthood.Or you might just rent ""Walk The Line"", the new Johnny Cash biopic. It pretty much lays out the bad stuff that can happen to kids who live the permissive lifestyle; fun up front, death afterwards."
1,Crap,"I thought this was a real book with a little biography and some photos throughout but it's not. It's one page of photos, one page biography and the rest is sheet music. So if you are just looking for sheet music then yes but I was extremely disappointed in this item.........TIme wasted"
4,Great Addition to the Room,"I love this gossip bench! It is beautiful and exactly the right size. It is a great addition to any traditional room, with just enough room on the side table for a phone and lamp. It was difficult to assemble, so be prepared for that. Mostly the difficulty was getting the pieces into a position where it was easy and comfortable to do what had to be done. Another difficulty was that some of the bolts are deep inside predrilled holes when you have to tighten them. You can't see them, and if the allen wrench slips, it can be hard to find the slot again. But once you get past all that, the piece of furniture is wonderful."
2,Noisy,"i like the form factor, and the sound is decent but there is a very high frequency buzz that gives me a headache. It is most apparent when listening to talk radio. I will be returning these."
4,A visual masterpiece,"Lent to me by a friend to get ideas on using large planters I found A Tuscan Paradise to be an absolute delight to both the eyes and soul. Not only is there beauty in the landscape photographs but of those indoors as well, how the home and its furnishings harmonize with the spendor of nature well attended.Schinz's individual photographs are often masterpieces of composition, visual ships-in-a-bottle of perfection. They hold one's eyes like fine Impressionism.If you have a friend who loves gardening, buy them this book! It makes me want to pack for Tuscany every time I think of it."
2,Comparable to Epson except constant clogging,"When it worked, this product is comparable to the Epson branded cartridge. The (only) one I purchased frequently clogged up. I would have to go through the printer cleaning routine almost every time I turned on the printer. I'll be trying other brands before I try this one again."
3,Sketchy,"Compared by various reviewers to ""Heathers,"" ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High,"" ""Election,"" and ""Clueless,"" ""Mean Girls"" falls short of the mark.The problem with Tina Fey's screenplay for ""Mean Girls"" is that her background as a sketch writer for ""Saturday Night Live"" shines through. Though individual scenes and moments can be downright hilarious, the movie as a whole doesn't hang together. A shame, because the movie is well cast and features decent performances from all. It will be interesting to see how Lindsay Lohan's career progresses once she leaves her teen years behind. But to return to the screenplay, it is not, as Roger Ebert characterizes it, a ""comic and sociological achievement."" As I said, the comedy is inconsistent--and the insight isn't all that insightful.Having said that, the teenage girls in the audience seemed to enjoy it, it got more laughs than ""Jersey Girl,"" and it does a decent job as the high-school comedy the trailers imply. Just don't go in expecting too much more."
5,GREAT,"This movie was fantastic. it really explored the scary world of teenage girls. It was surprisingly real, funny, and satiritical. A great movie with a great actress."
3,Heathers revisited.,"I took my 14 year old goddaughter to see this flick about mean teens. I thought the acting was pretty good and the story is definitely rooted in reality from what I remember of high school (I graduated 11 years ago). However, much of the material in the movie is risque and not appropriate for kids under 16, it's really bordering on ""R"". Some of the stuff is just the wrong message rather than blatant visual things. However, I was very suprised at the number of times my goddaughter leaned over and said, ""what does that mean?"". I assumed these days kids had seen and heard it all by age 12. Maybe not. By the way...if you're thinking I'm so crazy right-wing conservative prude, you're way off."
1,Not a children's movie,This movie should have been rated R for language and content. Mean Girls is a horrible movie about girls fighting over boys and popularity. The main character Cady gets mixed in to a crowd of girls called the plastics who get involved in things that kids younger than 16 shouldn't watch and use language that no one should use at all. I would not recomend this movie for a family outing.
3,A Chick Flick,"It's not really a real life story, but it has a good cat fight story line, It's also just kind of a movie to watch when your board. I do enjoy watching it though mostly that is stars Lindsay Lohan and now that I saw the Notebook, I also like Racheal McAdams in the movie too, over all it's a pretty good movie,I would recommend it to one of my close friends,but not really a boy!"
3,"Not exactly what I was expecting, but not bad...","Plants were all plotted in one container, and the roots had grown together. Had to snip some larger roots to split the group in half to transplant them to larger containers, since the roots were already ready for it. Some shoots arrived yellow, all had their tips cut... The jury's still out on how well they'll grow, but I don't think they'll have too much of a problem. I would've given it 4 stars if I hadn't had to cut up the roots to get the two groups separated. This won't deter me from ordering again with them, either."
4,Surprisingly good,"This is the best album Ratt never made. Considering this is a cleaned up demo from over 15 years ago, I was shocked at just how good this CD was. Its a collection of very radio friendly hair metal songs that most groups between '89 and '91 would have been proud to claim. A real hidden gem."
4,Good product but had a mistake in one of the drawings in the instructions,The product is nice and looks great. Took a bit of coordination to build especially since there was one drawing mistake in the instructions.IT's not the strongest structure but it is nice and can last for a long time if not moved around too much
5,Yummy,"Well, yummy if you like shiatsu, that is. This is a 36 minute workout which can be split into 3 separate parts. It uses a hard foam roller - and there is no way you can do this routine without it..... It feels great. Like deep tissue massage. Lots of deep stretching, getting into the underarms and the sides of the hips and places you didn't even know were tight. There's a little bit of core work thrown in, which is super tough because of the roller. At least, i found it super tough. But I haven't been doing enough pilates lately, so perhaps it isn't that tough. Who knows? Anyway, it's just enough to get you even more streightened out, and not that much that the routine feels like too much work. this is a good one for after weight workouts, or perhaps cardio, or for days when you don't have energy and want to do something. I really like it. Felt nicely wrung out after."
2,For the Orange version,"Hopefully the new version has this corrected, but I purchased the orange-covered version in 2008. It holds potential, but when it was edited they completely skipped the stretches for the second leg.If you google you will find other comments on this, so please be aware of that when looking at these DVDs."
5,Hilarious! A Great Read,"I was talking to a co-worker who mentioned that Pizza Hut is now purchasing advertising on the side of a rocket. If Fredrick Pohl wasn't prophetic, I don't know who is. The addictive soda pop, the advertisements on the retina, chicken little, etc, are just too funny for words. Unfortunately, this wonderful book is out of print, so I can't tell my Generation-X coworker to read it, which is too bad because you can easily draw parallels to today's society -- and this was written in the 50's! If you get your hands on this gem, read it, it will be well worth the effort."
2,not worth it,the bag simply looks cheap. material and quality is bad. looks like something you can get on the street. i'm very disappointed. will not recommend to anyone
1,dont buy,this is a peace of junk dont buy i have it about 6 or 7 months and the parts that haing on the tank will break after a copel a month its a total waste of money and made wich cheap low grad plastic
1,no good,"I fought with this quick release from day one. The problem is there is no room for a screw between the two pieces. The flat head straight screw is so shallow that you can't grip it with a screw driver. I have a large flat screwdriver and still you can't get the grip you need to secure it. So, what happens during your shoot? Your camera starts to slide around, twist and once you straighten your camera back, it's over, the camera moves freely. Stick with the original baseplate!"
2,where is the plot? what is the point?,"except for a great soundtrack and sexy Matt Kessler, this film has nothing going for it all all...the acting is good and I love Kate Beckinsdale and Chloe Sevigny...but this film was terrible..it started off good enough and i thought I was gonna enjoy it, but by the time the hour is over, you realize the movie is not going anywhere and how bored you are...totally pointless....but great soundtrack...i was confused...too many characters..."
3,"Good, but it's no Barcelona","As with Barcelona, the highlight for me is the dialogue, especially from the mouth of Chris Eigeman (""It's Like, You Know...""). But the dialogue here isn't quite so engaging as it is in Barcelona.The characters, while generally unlikable (Eigeman's character dumps women by pretending to have ""discovered"" that he's gay), are well-drawn.If you liked Barcelona, go ahead and get this. If you haven't seen Barcelona, pick that over this."
3,NOT WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK,"IF YOU EXPECT TO HEAR WHAT KEVIN USUALLY ADDS TO THE DELBERT MCCLINTON ""SOUND "", THIS ISN'T IT. YOU'LL HEAR A DIFFERENT SIDE OF THE KEYBOARD...FROM A GREAT PLAYER."
5,VORTEX RYTHMS,"IT'S VERY DIFERENT AND HAS THE COLORS OF THE DESERT, IN ASTRANGE WAY IT MAKES ME FEEL LIKE IM IN THE DESERT. ITS VERY ENJOYABLE MUSIC. I REALLY LIKE IT. BRENTON"
4,superior to 'cast in stone',"even though this dics is short, it is rough and raw, unlike follow-up full-length 'cast in stone'. songs trail off or end abruptly as if tape ran out during the sessions, or because the songs were only partially written. for a band such as venom, this isn't important, if anything, it gives them character and links them with their go-for-broke sound from the early days of the band. good stuff, i only wish they'd kept the raw vibe for 'cast in stone'."
4,Important voice in sf,"DISTANT STARS is a curious re-collection of Delany short stories. It's perhaps notable most for including the story ""Omegahelm"", which is unavailable elsewhere but interesting in that it is uses the same narrative setting as Delany's well-known novel STARS IN MY POCKET LIKE GRAINS OF SAND. Most of Delany's best-known and award-winning stories are here, alongside several previously-uncollected lesser efforts. The volume also includes some ambitious, if not always entirely successful, illustrations to accompany the tales. In any case, probably a must for Delany devotees, and it's a shame the collection is out of print."
3,"Okay, but not great","The first time I watched this movie, I was less than impressed. My 5 year old son bought this movie with his birthday money, so I was forced to watch it repeatedly. After a few viewings it grew on me, but it really isn't that good of a movie.The voice talent is a good thing/bad thing. Its obvious who is doing the voices, and the animators went out of their way to make the sea life look exactly like the person who was voicing them. Although it was amusing at times, it seemed like it had an awful lot of adult references that would sail right over a childs head. Still, my son seems to get a kick out of it."
2,Shark Tale,"Oscar is a fish who works in a ""whale wash"", like his Dad did. He wants to be a somebody, but without much money there's not much chance of that. In fact, he's in a bit of debt with the owner of the whale wash, and he ends up being tied up underwater, left to the sharks. When a shark looking to feed on him accidentally is killed by an anchor, Oscar takes the credit as a ""shark slayer"". Maybe he'll be a somebody then...""Shark Tale"" is pretty smoothly animated, but the plot isn't quite that engaging. Two and a half stars."
4,Shark Tale,"I had previously purchased this movie so that my grandchildren would have something they would enjoy to watch when they came to my home. My 3 year old grandson got upset when he went home that he did not have this movie, so I purchased this for him as a Christmas gift. We all enjoy these types of movies!"
3,Dreamworks has made a boo-boo w/ this one.,"While Shrek 2 scored big-time, being both funny and bringing modern stuff to medival times, Shark Tale tries way way too hard to be like Shrek, and that's where it fails. While there were tons of stars in the movie, which, as most would assume, would bring it to high standards, Shark Tale sank. (No pun intended.) Oscar, the main character, is greedy and wishes for more, while Angie, who is a worthwhile buddy, stands by and tries to encourage Oscar and his dreams. Then, like usual, Oscar screws up and everything goes out of whack. Maybe I'm just a party popper...But this movie is not all it's hyped up to be. I wouldn't recommend it."
2,"It Should be Re-Titled ""Will Smith Tales""","I actually found this movie to be irritating. I thought I was watching a cartoon about Will Smith. As I'm watching this movie, I didn't see Oscar the Fish, but the Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. I found myself concentrating on the actors opposed to the movie & plot. The only character I liked was the shrimp.The extras on the DVD are pretty good though. It has a cool underwater club video and it has instructions on how to do the same moves that were in the video. It's abuut four different instuctional short videos. I think kids will love that.If you are absolutely in love with Will Smith, you'll like this movie. Otherwise you may wannt to skip it."
3,mindlessly mediocre,"For parents, this is just plain dumb. It is slapstick. Perhaps it is like seeing the Three Stooges for the first time as an adult: unless you got it emotionally at about age 5, it is a real zero.The kids will watch it, but it will degrade their minds. I know, I spent my childhood watching the stooges, and it sure didn't do anything for me with the ladies.Not recommended, unless you don't care what you shovel into a kid's head."
2,"Ok, But Not Great.","The animation is Ok. But the storyline is poor. It stalls, and meanders. The casual way mobsters are portrayed is not acceptable for kids viewing."
1,Disappointed,This was my grandson favorate movie and was very disappointed that is didnt work and I had to return it.
3,Average,"The movie was entertaining, but I was kind of disappointed. Compared to other animated movies (i.e.- shrek, monsters inc., etc...), this wasn't as funny. However, if you are an animation junky, you will want this movie. Now, would you watch more than once? That I am not sure."
3,Mediocre audio and 15 min commercial is unskippable,"Dreamwork rediculously made the beginning commercial unskippable. I have kid and we can't finish the whole movie in 1 run. So everytime we pop the movie in, we have to sit through the lengthly commercial before we can get to the main menu to select the chapter.In addition, I have 7.1 speakers configuration and I can't get all 7 channels for this movie. All other animation let me select Dolby Digital EX (sound from 8 speakers) but this one doesn't. You are stuck with Dolby Digital 5.1 and that's the best you can get. Not much effect.The animated part is good. Not excellent comparing to Shrek, The Incredible or Finding Nemo.Dreamworks movie is for rent. That's what it should be. Don't waste your money buying this title. It's a ripped off compare to other animation movie with better sound capability and skippable trailers."
2,Sounds a Bit Fishy to Me...,"This IS a kids movie? Gangstas, hoods, really, really unlikable characters who lie to achieve success. Where is the morality? Where are the lovable characters? There is no sweetness to it, no fun. A great deal of mean spiritness was put into this. The animation is great, each frame is a framable work of art. The voice talent is good, but are to connected to adult themes. This is no Nemo, no Shrek, not even Sinbad. Swim fast away from this one."
2,Stay away,"I expected a lavishly illustrated volume, but the volume is actually quite sparsely illustrated. Hardly a coffee table book at all. However, that must have been what the editor envisioned with the project. Create coffee table book for bankers and charge through the roof ($130). In fact what you get is an edited volume, with contributions of various quality. I bought a second hand copy for $39 but even that is massively overpriced. Three stars, but one additional reduction for the price"
4,It's a keeper.,"The title of this flick doesn't exactly fall trippingly off the tongue. I'm not sure I'll remember it forever, but I think this story will stay in my memory banks for a long time. It's a love story so that angle is nothing new. The plot was unique, though, and the two love interests were two very attractive and very likeable people whom I had no trouble cheering for as they walked the circuitous route to discovering that they were in love. This story was a bit contrived, in my opinion, causing me to only rate it four stars. Things like booking an expensive airline ticket to see someone, without calling to ensure they are available bug me. Perhaps I'm too pragmatic to be incurably romantic. The message of the movie involved divorce recovery, a topic for which too many people have first hand experience and a need. This movie can help."
5,Mother Wonderfuls Cheesecake,I have been looking for this book for years. Bought 2 used for my daughters for Christmas. They were in excellant condition. They loved them
2,Didn't last long,"These didn't hold up long at all; holes appeared at the seams within a few months, and the color faded off very quickly. I wouldn't buy them again; the quality is lacking too much. Nice and slick regarding the feel of the material, though, which is what I was looking for."
5,First-rate album,"This is the first album I have heard from Grey Delisle. I am going to have to get all the rest now. She has a beautiful voice, top-knotch delivery, and is an excellent songwriter in several different genres.Many people will probably be put off by the fact that the first track on this album is a cover of Bohemian Rhapsody, but they shouldn't. DeLisle actually she treats it as a song, rather than as a kitsch icon, and almost pulls it off. The song probably has too much cultural baggage to overcome, but DeLisle comes breathtakingly close.The rest of the album is all originals, and there isn't a weak track on the whole album. It's comparatively short - ten tracks in less than 45 minutes - which makes a nice change from 70 minutes albums with 40 minutes of filler.Highlights include the gorgeous pop of Right Now, the hedonistic country of The Bloody Bucket, the loose garage rock of Blueheart, and the hard-hearted ballad Who Made You King."
4,A must for cataloging. However...,"...there's a new edition coming out in January, I believe. This book is almost indispensable for cataloging; this, plus access to the Library of Congress Authority Files and MARC bibliographic references online are pretty much all you need in the school library."
1,The Worthless Waist of Time of Billy Owens,"Before I go in to details of this garbage, let me just say don't by the movie! I was lucky because I bought the movie for 5 bucks, instead of the outrages price it is being sold for here!Billy Owens, is a cheap Harry Potter knockoff. The lead character, Billy Ownes(Harry Potter)finds a magic wand in a store shop owned by a wise wizard (Dumbledore) he and his friends, Mandy(Hermoine) and What's His Name (Ron), must go on some task to save their town.The script seemed to be written by some third grader who just finished watching Harry Potter. The movie is hard to follow. At first Billy Owens seems to be the only child with magic abilities and then every one in the town has magic to.The villian of the story seems to change every three minutes and the biggest threat of all is a vine.The film had terrible effects, terrible acting, terrible script, terrible camera crew!Bottom Line....the movie's GARBAGE!Avoid at all cost!"
4,Bizarre truthiness chills camp girls,"This was a totally situational purchase. My daughter happens to be a camper at the summer camp Laurie Dann attended. Dann is a mythological name at the camp. So this book ""made it real"" for the older girls at the camp. Much debate as to whether to use as campfire read. Wise decision made to demur in this regard."
3,rio carbon,The rio carbon isn't the greatest mp3 player ive ever had but it does have a very large storageOther than the large storage it has really bad battery it doesnt last very longAlong with the bad battery comes a few skips once and a while does anyone know why it skips its an mp3 player not a diskman it should not skipThe rio carbon also has no waranty after 30 days
2,"Good calculator, but flawed","The TI-34II is a good calculator that is easy to use.Unfortunately, it has one fatal flaw. While it allows numbers to be entered in scientific notation, it doesn't have a feature to show the result of a calulation in scientific notation. With a 10 digit display, it can be hard to figure out if 100000000 is 1 billion or 100 million. Lack of comma's to group digits into 3's also hurts. I ended up buying a CASIO FX-115MS, which does have the scientific notation and comma's.If the TI had the comma's and scientific notation, it would beat the CASIO hands down for ease of use, and also contruction. I also like the fact that it remembers prior calculations even after auto-powering down. The CASIO forgets after any power down."
3,Powerful but repetative,"The vignettes of poverty and inability to rise in our society are powerful. The author weaves together stories that every American should be aware of and they really affect our everyday lives. The author does not do a great job at defining the chapters and weaving a greater pattern, so after the 15th story you begin to feel like you have read this next one before."
2,mostly false innuendo,"This book claims to expose how hard and terrible it is to be the `working poor' but this is a false claim. The working poor aren't `invisible' in fact they are very visible. Every time one gets gas or goes to a fast food restaurant or goes to a lumber yard they get to witness the working poor in their natural environment. And in fact the term `working' is improperly addendumed to the word `poor' in this book. Many poor people, this book ignores them, are not working at all, they are simply sitting around. This is a false analysis and a dry text, not really that insightful, since most of its conclusions are blatantly obvious.Seth J. Frantzman"
