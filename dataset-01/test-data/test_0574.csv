3,Great for shorter people,"If your shower pipe hangs down like the one pictured with the item, beware that this shower system hangs quite low.Mine was missing a washer but hooked up easily.Also the stream is a bit hard for my taste."
3,"Functions OK, but is large and ugly","This shower head functions OK, but it is too large and, as others have noted, it hangs too low in the shower, making it ugly, obtrusive and somewhat unfriendly to tall folks."
4,squeaky clean,"I really like this shower head.. I don't love it though. The part of the head that is not removable does not have as good of pressure as i would like... like I said, I really like it but I don't love it!"
3,Nice Duel Functionality,"I was hoping that it worked as good as people were talking about on amazon. It's pretty good but not as good as my old one. I do like the dual functionality and the ability to switch between the 2 heads. My old Waterpik was able to have more water pressure than this one, so it is going to have to take some getting used it or seeing if I can optimize it for a harder water pressure stream.The water is more of a rainfall than a cleaning pressure. I do like that it comes with a lifetime warranty so that if it breaks in the future (like my Waterpik) then I can get it replaced! :) It is also great for washing your dog/cat in the shower as you can use the manual showerhead too."
5,Great book!,"I needed a baby food for dummies type book and this is one of a few I liked! Its very easy to use, has good explanations and so far seems to provide correct information with regards to foods to avoid, list of approved foods, etc. I like the charts that provide an at-a-glance for what is okay to feed, etc. Definitely worth the money!"
3,Baby food idea,"I was originally looking for a daily menu suggestions from this book which this book does provide. However, I personally think the recipes, especially for the first & second weaning stages, are too complicated and not suitable for babies at those stage."
4,Great for those concerned about baby's nutritional health,"This is a great book for parents who are concerned about their child's nutritional health. A line out of the book struck home, ""You wouldn't feed all that processed food to the rest of your family; why feed it to your baby?"" Ms Karmel offers not only easy-to-prepare recipes, but advice and meal planners (a great help with my first child when I wasn't sure what I was doing). With the help of this book, I never had to buy baby food in a jar. The recipes don't take much time and effort to prepare (great news for busy moms and dads). Her suggestion to keep individual servings in the freezer, and heat as needed worked for me! You don't have to be a health food fanatic to appreciate the virtues of good food."
1,"Sleak Apperance, Good Connectivity but very poor Picture.","I had this CRT HDTV now little over a year. This is my 2nd.This Screen also bows on top and bottom of the screen. But only heavily noticeable in SD mode and 420i/p (4:3).The effect is gone during fullscreen HD 720,1080 (16:9).The biggest annoyance is that the screen does not fit in the picture.I mean you can not read the bottom and/or top news bar on cnn, or when watching a sportsgame like football.Same with my Videogame picture. It really sucks that i can not see the info on top and bottom !! The connectivity is very good (HDMI, Optical Audio etc.)Avoid this TV if its for your primary livingroom. Ok for bedroom."
2,consider this a lease,"we bought this tv in the end of nov. It died while my husband was watching it almost three weeks ago (begining of May) we are trying to get it fixed by Samsung, last week a repair man came with the wrong part, one week after I called Samsung, Today he changed a part and 30 minutes after he left it died again, so now I am going on 3 weeks with no TV and more waiting. The corners started discoloring 1 or 2 months after we bought it. buy something else, $700 and five months later we don't have a TV."
3,"Good, but not Great","This is a decently solid hymnal. Nonetheless, there are many revivalist, sentimental, and otherwise problematic hymns in it. The psalm settings range from great to ""what were they thinking?"". Some of the tunes from the blue trinity hymnal have been given better versions in this one, which is appreciated. Other tunes, however, are clearly dated (eg., #500's setting is painful, though thankfully the same hymn is given a better tune in #499). ""This is my Father's World"" is blatantly Platonic and has no business being sung in Reformed churches. Definitely, one still needs to use discernment in choosing hymns from this hymnal as not every hymn is theologically solid, but it is, nonetheless, one of the best hymnals available right now. If you're not in dire need of a hymnal immediately, I would wait for the OPC's upcoming psalter hymnal, though it's still a couple of years out."
3,Seth Dreams and Projections of Consciousness,"I decided to experiment and try the dream diary, as well as making suggestions to myself prior to sleep. I had immediate results. This book may be hard to follow at times and you may have to read a paragraph several times to fully understand the meaning; however, the book is well worth the time spent to gain the knowledge. This one is a keeper for me."
1,Even Monty Python Was Never >THIS< Silly,"Michael Levin is a perfect example of what happens when you take a chap and put him through a Ph.D. program. Because he masters (absolutely) one tiny thing, he thinks he can speak authoritatively on everything. The result, in the words of Kant, is ein Mangel an Urteilskraft (Kritik der reinen Vernunft, A135/B173). [We can cite Kant here; Levin seems to like Kant's view, though he also seems to get it wrong -- typical AngloAmerican twit.] Let's put aside the question of political correctness; the main problem is that Levin has mistaken mere evidence -- inherently problematic -- for scientific explanation. This is to say, his book is fine, but his fundamental assumption of the adequacy of evidence, and the model constructed from it, is mysterious, wrongheaded and mistaken. The result is a very dull book, actually. You can get the same errors from The Bell Curve, which is at least better written and where the yucks are a good deal easier to find."
1,Unspeakable,"A Jewish scientist pushing absurd, hateful and outdated race ""science""?! Hello! Has he ever heard of the Holocaust? That's where this kind of thinking ultimately leads: The gas chambers and the ovens. Not to mention slavery, the extermination of the Native Americans and Austalian Aboriginies, centuries of brutal colonial rule and repressive immigration restriction based on ""race."" Come on, people. Wake up and learn the harsh lessons of this melinium before we go into the next."
1,Don't waste your money,"The worst sounding boombox I've heard. No bass at all, although it claims to have a bass boost. All the components in it are crap ! It is also very heavy. I guess the manufacturer has mistaken weight for quality."
1,Masada Bath Salts- Very inferior product,"Masada Bath Salts, Relaxing Lavender, Dead Sea Mineral, 64 Ounces (1.814 kg)After reading most of the reviews on the above product, I was ""sold"" and very eager to try it and ordered this product on Amazon.com.These bath salts really irritated my skin and did not soften the bath water. The brand I had been using did but, unfortunately, is no longer available.Worse yet, I am out some $22 since this product had been opened and does not qualify for a refund."
2,Just OK....,"I am a bath fanatic and I look for products that work with a spa tub - those that don't foam and bubble. I also like products that retain their scent through the entire bath and that soften my skin. This product fails on both counts - there is barely any scent and it does nothing to soften the water or your skin. I have used other products of Masada and have only been disappointed with this one, so far."
1,DANGER!,I purchased this product without knowing how it works. The instructions did not warn against smoking it. This product caused me to eat my friends alive. I'd like my money back.
3,"Nice scent, probably not worth it",Dead sea bath salts? Why not. I mean if you believe everything like i do then you're also a sucker.I run and work out a lot and after a long day of work am sore. I sometimes like to just sit in the tub and soak. These are actually really nice bath salts. But for the price they aren't really worth it. I don't get any more benefit from these than i did with just epsom salts. They claim that the powers of nature will cure all your problems. All the whatever ingredients will turn you into a magical unicorn too. I don't think i'd buy this again. I'd probably buy some epsom salts and sprinkle some lavender or some other thing in the bath. Same effect.Don't get me wrong. Maybe the salts have some magical benefit. I just didn't see it.
2,Too much perfume...,"I don't know about men, but as a woman who can't use bubble bath products because it causes irritation in certain submerged areas, this causes the same problem. Way too much perfume. I can handle lightly scented products but this one is heavily perfumed. I couldn't use it. On the plus side, my husband smells great."
3,IMPORTANT FOR BUYERS TO READ!!,"This product would have probably been a really good book. But unfortunatly, You must have Macromedia Flash MX installed on your computer(Which I have no Idea how to get). Only buy this if you have ""Macromedia Flash MX""on your computer."
4,Great,I was really impressed with the quickness that the product got to me. The only thing bad (and its really nit picky) is that I had to make a minor modification to the lower radiator hose. That is due to the fact that the motor the hose was purchased for is in another model car. Its a great prodict and adds to the cleanliness of my engine bay. Thanks you for a outstanding product
1,HUH?,I received this as christmas gift from sister. Brand new in the box never been opened. I was so excited but that quickly dies when I took it out the package pluged it in and tried to turn it on. NOTHING!!!! The on/off button doesn't even work. It does charge my i-pod though.....But I can't listen to it or do anything else with it. Now I am off researching a new one!VERY DISAPPOINTED!
1,90 DAY WARRANTY!!!???,"A 90 DAY WARRANTY IS RIDICULOUS. UNHEARD OF FOR THE PRICE. MINE WENT OUT IN 9 MONTHS. DON'T BUY IT!IT LOOKS GOOD, BUT IT IS CHEAP INTERNALLY!!!"
1,Waste of Money,"Had for less than one year and now it won't power up; flashes on and shuts immediately off. May be a coincidence, but didn't have problems powering up until after I played it with its battery power. Tried to play with and without batteries since, but it isn't working."
1,junk,"I bought this about a year ago and was really happy with it until it just broke for no reason. When I contacted Memorex customer support, I was given instructions to 'reset' it. Didn't work. I have found many others online that had the same problem as I did, and were not able to fix it. Don't waste your money unless you are looking for a disposable ipod player."
4,Provocative!,"Even though described for 9-12 year olds (which surprised me), this is a terrific thought provoking book. Perfect for d'var Torahs and teaching. Lots of Talmudic wisdom and midrashim packed in a delightful edition. A great gift idea as well. I really enjoyed reading and rereading the different chapters."
3,Lots of seafood,"I got this as a gift from someone who visited Hawaii. I was looking forward to cooking from it, but I don't eat seafood, and most of the recipes are seafood based. The book is very pretty, but the index leaves much to be desired. It simply restates the table of contents recipe titles, so it's not helpful if you are trying to find dishes based on certain ingredients.Some of the ingredients are obscure or really oddly specific, like 'Sweet 100s Tomatoes' instead of 'cherry tomatoes' or 'Hawaiian Chocolate' instead of 'chocolate'."
3,"Complicated recipes, not enough from Roy's","I've been an avid home chef for years, and the recipes seem complicated to me."
2,Adequate,"I was looking for a bare-bones coffee maker that would fit in a fairly tight space, and that's what I got. I'm glad to have something without paying for things I won't use, like the ability to set it up to start automatically at some future time, and therefore avoiding yet another clock in the kitchen, and very glad that I can squeeze it into the same counter space occupied by my former coffeemaker, but it is disappointing that it is so cheaply made. The top of the water reservoir is particularly flimsy, and doesn't fit properly so that it closes cleanly. Also the heating plate only keeps the coffee lukewarm, and it is necessary to microwave it to get a hot cup of coffee."
5,Soooo Handy!,"This is an awesome product, saved my neck. It is very easy to use and worth every dime. A bit of advice...Get the handset lifter attachment, very cool!!"
4,Plantronics CS10,"Great product, Co worker had one that I saw. Works well, no background noise. Headset actually stays on your head. I would recommend this product to anyone."
1,This book didn't have to be this difficult,"I am a joint law student/international affairs masters student. Surprisingly, after a year and a half of law school, I have never had a textbook as difficult to read and understand as this one. The authors take complicated ideas and make them even more complex.It is almost as if the authors are competing with the experts in IR they include in this book, trying to see who can use more obscure words and incomprehensible sentences.Reading this book, I keep telling myself, I could write this sentence or that sentence clearer. The authors should fire their current editor for the fourth edition and hire someone who is fluent in English, not technobabble.The Glossary is sparse and the index is lacking many key ideas and phrases discussed in the textbook.Professors, if you want your students to truly understand IR, pick another book which explains IR theory more clearly and without such convoluted jargon.Terrible book."
4,"Very good, but...","The battery was an exact fit, & very easy to install. It works pretty good, but has only about a two hour life without charging."
3,not to good,This tape would not play on one side. It was very stacticy and you couldnt make out any of the words.Product was shipped immadiatly and arrived in good shape.
4,Same machine @ Sears,I bought the same machine this week @ Sears(0921400) for $139.99 This is a solid bench top machine that set up easy with good fit & finish. Bandsaw size is 70&1/2 inchs so not easy to find.
1,Motley Blew,"All I can say is thank goodness I didn't waste my money on this. Whoever posted the review that said Vince can't sing anymore was right. He missed half the songs and the other half he sounded like he was out of breath. I couldn't understand what he was trying to sing. He would try to hide his lack of vocal ability by holding his mic for the audience to sing or just scream some garbage. I'd be upset if I paid all that money for the concert only to sing the songs myself. They definitely should've overdubbed Vince's ""singing"". The rest of the band sounded pretty good. Don't get me wrong I like Motley and the new CD is pretty good. But Cruesfest 2008 leaves very little to be desired."
4,Motley Crue - 'Motley Crue - Crue Fest 2008' (Seven Eleven Music) 4 1/2 stars,"Good 2 DVD presentation of the famed 2008 Crue Fest tour. One factor I appreciated here was the fact that this live concert DVD was different than their 'Carnival Of Sins' trek I caught a couple of years ago. With DVD 1, I enjoyed {although the editing could be better} ""Wild Side"", ""Shout At The Devil"", their new offering - the power rocking ""Saints Of Los Angeles"", ""Primal Scream"", ""Looks That Kill"" and ""Girls Girls Girls"" the best. On DVD 2, I was fairly impressed with the performances by Trapt (almost forgot about this Los Gatos band), Papa Roach and especially Buckcherry. Overall, not bad for a three hour music DVD. I guess since Ozzfest is now taking a break, the summer music scene has left a door open for Crue Fest. What'll it be next - Kiss Fest?"
3,Enjoiable funnay trivial rejoinder from a christian polemic,"Missiology has a specialized field called polemics. Eventhough it froaths a lot it sheds very little light like its closed, sel-righttious ideology (CHRISTIANITY). But I enjoied this book and it shows the mind-set of a christian polemist. Eenthough it lacks substance it should be read to analyze how an adherent of a closed ideology twists the facts."
1,Amateurish!,"After viewing this, I've decided to market my own home movies that were taken when I was drunk. If you purchase this video and enjoy it, then I can show you some swell shots of a party we had on the Oregon Coast. I am now convinced that ANYONE can sell bad merchandise at Amazon."
4,Great Illustrations - keeps my children's interest,"My children (ages 15, 12, and 7) all enjoy looking at this book. Well-illustrated, well-written."
1,it stunk!,I got this phone for christmas a few years ago and it was great then. now it doesnt hold a charge for longer than an a few hours and you cannot put it next to a laptop due to its only 2.4 ghz wil mess up a wireless connection. do not buy this phone if you are putting it next tp a wireless conection router or if you forget to put a phone back on the charger.
3,Multi-talented,"There were a number of the pieces that I didn't like, including the *few* that had profanity, but there were others that *really clicked*, and there is no way that I could say that this man has no talent. So I'll average it out and put it somewhere in the middle. As for egos, do not all poets put something of themself on the page?"
4,A Great Read,"The journey of a man who not only experiences life but observes, thinks, and writes about it. Each time I read both poems and prose I glean more insight, whether into the author's life or my own is unsure. A thought-provoking work that will have a prominent place in my library. I look forward to further publications by James Morrison."
3,Panasonic - both good and bad,"What I like about this telephone is that the numbers are large and it has caller ID. There are two things that I do not like, and I consider to be major defects. One is that the display is not backlit and you cannot see it (even when the telephone is ringing) unless you turn on an overhead light. The other major defect is that whenever anyone in the house hangs up any of our telephones, this telephone emits a dial tone (for a fraction of a second) over the speaker phone. I fail to see any useful purpose for this."
2,If i were a rich man....,"Ever wish you could press your nose against the window of some really wealthy young people and see their fabulous furniture? Well, here is your chance. Wow, these folks are terrific. They are all such models of hard work and creativity. You have to hand it to Brooke's Bright Young Things...they sure know how to choose the right parents."
5,"PCI Design Handbook, 5th Edition",Original book damaged via USPS (Left in rain). Replaced with new at no charge. I couldn't be happier with the end product!!!!!!!!These are good honest people.
2,Get the original instead.,"This is a decent hack job that may suffice if you can't find the Mon A Q original and are dying for this track, but I'd highly recommend searching out the original if you can find it."
1,Pure garbage,"The setting and look of this film are first rate, but it has no plot! The only thing worthwhile in this film is Saskia Post, but even her considerable beauty and talent can't turn this mess into a watchable movie."
3,"Different, Interesting, Useful",A friend suggested that I take a look at this book. Different than the many books on ecommerce. The last chapter really brings the ideas together.
2,So So,"I need a typewriter to fill out forms, those that I can not used computer for (IRS and such).It is little too complicated for this purpose, I mean, the whole word processing program is little redundant, since I do not type letters.It is very loud and ""clunky"", I wish I could buy manual one. Definitely takes up too much space.I can not say anything about repairs, since I used it for a few months only."
5,Another dark torment heroes!!,"This is another wonderful tale from Stuart who gives you big book quality even in series romance. He is naturally dark and brooding, the O'Neil, living with his housekeeper and son on the edge of the Maine coast, hiding from deep dark secrets and torments that he could not save him family from drowning. Cursed to live alone.She runs off the road in the middle of a hurricane to avoid hitting a ghostly little girl and it plunges her car into the deep waters of the sound. Just as she thought she was dying she is saved by O'neil.Taking the old worst opening line to start a book and making it a title, Stuart gives you one great supernatural tale and another of her dark tormented heroes."
5,Awesome!,"I could not put this book down. All I can say is if you loved Jane Yolens book ""Greyling"" as a child, you will love the shape-shifting hero O'Neal, and his ghostly family. This book is as good as it gets."
4,Great for Skype,"Purchased these for Skype calling - haven't used them for audio or gaming. For Skype, the sound quality seems good - equivalent or better to cell phone anyway. Relatively comfortable to use for one-ear headset, and long cord is convenient for standing up / walking around while talking. They seem flimsy & breakable but have lasted being carried around in my briefcase for a few weeks. Would buy again."
4,Nice Ride,"Likes: Light weight, not as long as some tandem strollers, easy to collaspe and put in trunk (we have an SUV), easy to turn in tight spots, can use infant Graco snugride carrier easily with attachment.Dislikes: no cup holder (& handle is square, so be careful if buying different brand cup holder attachments), canopy a bit hard to move compared to Graco stroller, no room for older child to sit down while infant carrier is attached - has to stand, seat does not lay flat for younger child to sleep. Piece of canopy attachment actually snapped off. Joovy sent a replacement part quickly, but it was still annoying that it actually happened."
2,Subtitle too small and fast.,"The movie was probably better but you had too focus so much on the tiny subtitles you missed it I had to rewind a few times too watch scenes I missed because of the subtitles they were small and went by too fast, I watch movies all the time with subtitles and this was a terrible job ."
4,ACTION,FOR A SUB-TITLE MOVE IT'S EASY TO FOLLOW.LOTS OF ACTION AND GOOD LESSON IN HISTORY AND WARFARE.I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE!
5,One of the best war movies...,It is one of the best war movies that I have seen.. even though I had to read through subtitles to understand it.
3,"Pretty, but empty","Disappointing. Pretty, but empty: battle battle battle, quite pretty moment, battle,battle, quiet pretty moment, battle battle battle battle battle, quiet pretty moment, and so on. The battles were pretty, the quiet moments were pretty. I didn't care what happened to anyone.Basically a painting in motion.Perhaps the longer original Chinese version is where the characters lived the lives we don't see in the International version."
1,Theatrical release is a butchered release,"This film runs nearly 288 minutes; this version less than half of that. I saw this version first and it kind of made sense, but when I watched the Internation Version (Part 1&2), I could see what a masterpiece John Woo had created. I hope he had nothing to do with this eviscerated US version because it does a great injustice to his wonderful and exciting motion picture."
5,Red Cliff,"a foreign movie that is quite spectacular in every scene of the movie that is done to detail, John Woo the director is one of the top people in his profession, action packed with a love for a woman that starts a manipulated war of deceit, revenge and survival."
5,Magnificent production,"I only viewed the International version of this film, so I cannot compare it with the shorter version. In fact, I have only viewed two John Woo films...Face/Off and Broken Arrow, neither which come close to this epic story. This is definitely a war movie, full of brilliant strategies but also a movie about relationships, loyalty and trust. Spectacular scenery, settings,costuming and choreography."
2,not very fun,this game kinda stinks. its mory scarey than it is fun. it just really isnt a whole lotta fun to play.
3,I'm not so sure,I think this is somewhat of a gimick. Been trying this item now for 3 weeks in local fresh waters and had hardly any bites. Going back to the old spinner. Worth a try for the price. Maybe it'll work for you
3,"Decent info, reasonable advice, difficult to read!","Let's just say this isn't what I expected to come in the mail when I ordered it. It seems more like a magazine article published in book-form rather than a book. The text is small and even appears in columnar form, just like a magazine or newspaper article, with a few illustrations for flavor. The information itself is reasonable and practical, and I would like to try its suggestions...but even as an avid reader of all media, I'm having a hard time getting into it because of the format. Larger font, a more pleasing spacing, organized into more of a book format, would have been much better received and easier to utilize."
3,Too iffy with the Bluetooth!,"I am pretty good with tech toys, but this one has never ceased to baffle me. Most of the time it will not even find the signal, but every once in awhile it connects and fools me. I pretty much have all things Bluetooth and WiFi in my world, including hearing aids that connect with my iPhone and iPad, and this is my one uncooperative dud. Would not recommend unless you are expert on this."
2,Waste of time and money,"This book is almost unuseable. Most of its pages seem to be fragments from various GTK+/Gnome header files with only rudimentary explanations. It does not answer most GTK+/Gnome beginners questions, even if they are experienced programmers.For example I wanted to call a file selection dialog. The index has one reference to GtkFileSelection, which consists of a screen shot and another reference to the corresponding #include file for this widget. That's it. The #include file contains several functions, none of them are explained or even mentioned in the book (at least I could not find them in the index).I'm afraid I have to buy another book to get my job done."
4,good,I think this album is very under-rated. I agree compared to Heavy D's older albums it probably isn't at good. Good Work D!
3,This Is Your Night,"I haven't actually heard the whole CD. Was at a nightclub and the DJ played ""This Is Your Night"". I absolutely loved it, went up to the DJ and asked him who sang the song... of course it is Heavy D, from their album ""Nuttin' But Love"". Don't know about you, but I love this song and I have finally found a copy to get it!!!! Thanks to the DJ for giving me the info!"
1,BROTHER TYPEWRITER,WHILE NOT THE FAULT OF AMERICA.ONLINE. THE TYPEWRITER IS A COM PLETE DUD.I HAVE REPLACED IT WITH AN IBM TYPEWRITER. I CAN GET NO SATISFACTION FROM BROTHER.
4,"Good example of Carl Hurley humor, but not his best work","Thoroughly enjoyable from beginning to end with several ""belly laugh"" bits of humor, but not as good as his more recent works I've heard on cassette (which I couldn't locate on Amazon, by the way). Still, all in all, a good recommendation and worth the money."
4,Allah Be Praised,"This is the story of the last days and final fall of the Ottoman Empire as seen through the career of a member of the sultan's harem. While some parts of this story are presented in a rather sketchy manner, character development is good, and you actually care about the people involved - even the bad ones! The photography is beautiful, and the scenes in the bathhouse are appropriately steamy. The Instant Video version ran approximately one hour and forty-five minutes."
4,A suprise,"An extremely charming film, beautifully told. Believe it or not, it's basically a women's movie, but I liked it anyway. One of the messages is quite a reactionary one, but also believable. I will look for more from this director."
1,TOTAL JUNK,"Total JUNK. I don't think thrones can get any worse than this. It took a wrench to tighten the thing and keep it from ""falling"" and I only way 137 pounds. DO NOT BUY"
1,Very Flimsy,This mattress is for a Handmade wood cradle and my little one SINKS in it... waste of money ~
5,Great study guide,"This book is a great study guide, covering Genesis to Revelation, Using biblical verses to back up every statment, Very hard to read cover to cover, but a great help in the study of the bible. He does a great job in presenting his interpritation and explaining why, He also paid attention in history class,he must have a great library"
3,gift,was purchased as a gift for someone so as far as I know they are enjoying it and it is very helpful
1,The Deliberate Stranger,"I purchased this 2-DVDs movie. When I received it, it was only DVD # 1 which could be played, #2 was totally destroyed. I wrote a complaint to the seller, and got a message back that it was no need for me to return it, he would send me new copies. I am still waiting..."
4,Why doesn't Amazon sell this DVD?,"I have been searching for this movie for years, after having seen it on TV and renting it on VHS. Now it is finally being released by Warner Brothers Archive for $19.95, yet Amazon is not offering it directly to customers? That is really a shame. As much as I would love to own this movie, featuring a brilliantly creepy Mark Harmon, I can't see paying the $39 price being charged by marketplace sellers. Please, Amazon....make this DVD available at a reasonable price!"
3,Pushing the envelope to House,"I have been an avid fan for the entire ""A Trip In Trance"" series. However, the sixth installment has me a little baffled. This CD is chock full of of beats that eerily remind me of House. Not that I'm saying the CD is bad per se, but it definitely is not Trance in the truest sense. If you are a fan of Trance, check out the earlier volumes. This is CD is not bad, but it definitely isn't truly Trance."
3,Low maintainer of sugar,Gave this a 3 star because I have found this product to be good for maintaining sugar but not a radical as prescribed medicines with hard side-effects. With exercise & healthy meals it works best BUT going off the reservation and I was facing high sugar levels. I traveled alot so I went off the reservation with bad fast foods!It maintains what you choose to work at if you are NOT willing to work that then I would find it not working for me..simple as that.
4,Video system for iPod,"When I puchased this item, I wanted to replace my portable DVD player. this has done just that for me. I travel alot and this really makes life easier for me. I can watch movies and listen to music and still have battery life in the iPod. The screen is great for 2 people to watch as is the dual headphone jacks. Great product."
5,camel junkies,The first time I listened to this CD I was suprised how good it was.I liked because there is music for everybody in the family.I think this CD is for almost everyone. I recommend this Cd to you!!P.S. buy it
3,They are Okay,"For the price that I paid, I wasn't expecting much but they are not that bad, the upper section of them, the rubber could be a bit thicker to make me happy but I guess they will do."
2,dont like this Album,"ive heard a lot better, but this cd is ok, i think that they should stop what they are doing it doesnt sound very good, but the overall quility i give a 2 out of a 5. i own the cd and im sorry that i ever bought it."
5,An aptly and extensively researched tribute,"An impressively informative work by transportation historian Brian J. Cudahy, A Century Of Subways: Celebrating 100 Years Of New York's Underground Railways tells of the amazing and critically important history of subway systems as a remarkable technological achievement in mass transportation which legendary for its practicality. A grand presentation that takes the reader and subway enthusiast on a vivid trip through time as an aptly and extensively researched tribute to the visionaries and power brokers behind the creation of New York's famous subways, A Century Of Subways would grace the American History and Transportation History collections of any academic or community library system."
4,"Intersting, informative and fun to read",Cudahy has done a good job of outlining the hisstory of New York subway syastems. Good reading!
2,Blame dad,"The author definitely has some issues with his father. It's always easiest to blame the parents. Although well organized, it's still a pretty cheap piece of whining."
4,The German Invasion,If you like N'Sync and other such pop bands you'll love this. The dynamic duo of two german pop stars is wonderful. A great buy even if you don't speak German.
3,A Great Book if You're a Fairly New Frequent Flyer,"I found this book complete and useful. However, 90% of the book contained Frequent Flyer info that is self evident to anyone who has spent over two or three years as a frequent flyer. There were a few good nuggets towards the end on methods to transfer miles and points between programs.For new flyers however, lots of the book was very relevant. A key element is concentrating miles in one program which they strongly emphasize.In short, great for new frequent flyers; very average for high flyers."
4,"This book is definitely worth a young, black woman's time.","I believe if you are a mother of a teenage girl or a teenager yourself, this book will interest you. It will probably cause the mother to gain a few extra gray hairs, but the truth lies within Omar Tyree's story. As for the teenager, she can learn a few tools about how boys or men around their age think and how they will do anything to retrieve a female's most precious asset. Remember ladies, this book was written by a man, therefore it comes from a man's point of view. If you are in your 20's or older, read it and remember your teenage years."
2,"Been there, done that....","Readers of black lit need to up their standards. Forget about this stuff and read writers like John Ridley, Darius James, Jill Nelson, Toni Morrison, Paul Beatty, and P. Lewis--all top-notch black writers. STOP THE SLOP."
3,An Okay Book,"Flyy Girl is an okay coming of age story. The book is about a young girl named Tracy growing up in the 80's. I knew the premise before opening the book, but I was shocked when the story started with Tracy's sixth birthday party and continued in two year intervals. An almost year by year account of Tracy's life really drags the book down. At times the story is so detailed that it becomes tedious. Sister Souljah does a much better job with ""Coldest Winter Ever"" I do not recommend this book to people who occasionally pick up a book to read, because it won't hold your interest. But if you a person who loves to read and then this book is a good one for a rainy day."
5,A must Read,Okay if you are under the age of 16 you should defiantly read this. I read this book when I was 12... since then I have read it so many times I couldn't even give you a count. This is one of the best books that I have ever read and it led me to read many more books after this. Tracey takes young girls on a journey that they too may go on one day and she teaches along the way.. Yeah being Flyy is every young girls goal but you gotta learn that there is so much more to that. I loved this book for what it taught and for what I took from it. Victor will be in your dreams for days to come. This is the best book that Omar Tyree has ever wrote.. The sequel was long and dry though.. But this is a MUST READ.
3,"Great on plot, bad on technique.","Okay, for the sake of the story, this book gets a 10 for character development and plot line.However, I have to give it a 3 for writing technique. There were typos in the text, copyrighted names spelled wrong, and more things that a good editor would have caught.Now, this may not matter to you if you are not a literature buff, so if you just want to read an entertaining and enlightening story about a different type of girl, this book is good."
5,Too Good To Even Put Down!!! Trust Me!!!,I absolutely love Omar Tyree's Flyy Girl. It hit the nail right on the head. This book is one of my favorites. I can relate so much to everthing being said and done in the novel. I beleive the reason that teens are so attracted to this book is because it is REAL. Straight up!! Tryee did a terrific job!! I can't wait to read For The Love of Money.
5,The best book ever!,This book is the best book ever written! It is worth your money. It's very hilarious and is not a waste of your time at all. It deserves more than 5 stars.
3,Good Enough,This was the first book I read from the author. I'll give him another read definitly. This book was alright it was just unnecessarily long. It had a great deal of characters. I enjoyed the book because it reminded me of how I acted at that age. I was happy Tracy did realize the path she was going down and changed before it was to late. The book was good that the author did not make the parents out to be crackheads or drug dealers.
4,a good coming of age book to relate to...,"I think that the book Flyy Girl is a very good book from the beginning to the end. I have not been able to put it down after reading one chapter. I wanted to know what was going to happen next based on the title of the next chapter. I recommend this book to any teenage girl, because i think Tracy is the typical teenage girl. I know that not all teens can relate to everything she does but I think that all teens will be able to relate in some way or another. If i had younger sibiling I would make them read this book because you can learn alot from it.i also liked the point that Omar Tyree wrote this book from a girls point of veiw, being a man in all."
4,worth the time,when I picked up this book I was like it a book about pretty lite skin girls then when I started to read it I was like this is such a good bokk and I think you will love the second book to it is everything that a teenager can to relate to and if I loved it you will too!
1,Save your $$,"This is the worst book I have EVER read. EVER. The plot was trite and ridiculous, the protgonist was an unsympathetic slut, and Tyree's command of the english language is questionable (at best). I am sick of publishers publishing any random book by a black author because they think that there's ""a market"" for it. Wake up! We won't read crap just because it's written by a black author! Quality counts and this book is sadly lacking in quality (and grammar). While reading it, I was searching around for a blunt object to bludgeon myself. It's AWFUL."
5,da bomb,"I HAVE READ THIS BOOK SIX TIMES AND HAVE RECOMMENDED IT TO TONS OF PEOPLE. TRACY'S LIFE IS SO SIMILAR TO LOTS OF GIRLS WHO GREW UP BOY CRAZY, LIKE ME. SHE REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF MYSELF THAT I WISH THE BOOK HAD NEVER ENDED. ANYONE, WHO HAS NOT READ THIS BOOK DOES NOT KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING. IT IS DEFINITELY A PAGE TURNER,SO RUN YOUR BATHWATER RELAX AN LET THE READING BEGIN."
2,This book had no point.,Summary of Book: A beautiful girl and her conceited attiutude toward others. Nothing that gets you stirring or moving.
5,"Omar Tyree is a real-life writer, but allows you to imagine.","""Flyy Girl is a great book for any age person. This book allows you to know and comprehend the real world but also allows you to use your imagination to become the character: Tracy and feel, see, and touch what she has. He reminds me of Shenska Jackson author of: Lil' Mama's Rules and Caught up in the Rapture."" KEEP ON WRITING SO I CAN KEEP ON READING GREAT BOOKS!!!!"""
4,Flyy Girl is da bomb,"Flyy Girl is definitely a book worth reading. I'm 21 years old and reading Flyy Girl just made me reflect on the times when I was growing up. I think every black woman today, knew a girl just like or very similar to Tracey or Rasheema(personally, I saw myself as Rasheema). In any case, if any black female want to read a book to reminisce on how it was back in the day, read this book. Or for people who wants to know how it was growing up in the 80's from a black women's perspective, this is the book to read. Good job, Omar....for a man! Naw just kidding."
4,My cat loved this toy....for awhile,"My cat Samwise loved this toy....for awhile. He played with the balls in it then lost interest. I still think this is a great toy, the other cats ignored it but then, they ignore most toys. I would recommend this for active kittens myself. It is very sturdily made so it should last quite a while."
1,Small & Not Exciting,"From the reviews, I expected this item to be large and to keep my cat occupied for hours. Upon receiving the toy, I was unimpressed. It is relatively small and my cat will only play with it if I prompt her (ie: if I am pushing the toys around, she will watch).It is, however, a good storage container for her small toys because she can take them out herself."
3,will have to wait and see,"I bought this toy because I know my cats love fishing for their toys that they bat under the fridge or the stove. I figured they would enjoy this just the same. I put treats inside to encourage them to play with it. One of them tried to get the treats out for a little while and the other just walked away. I'm hoping that they come back to it after a while. I also put other toys they like to play with inside and so far they just don't seem interested. We will have to wait and see if they warm up to it. It came with a round ball and a scrunchy type ball. The shipping was very fast though. so far, i think their favorite toy is the cat dancer. it's the cheapest thing too but they just love it for some reason."
4,Good Reading for Troubled Teens,"I think that the book was a good read. Many of the stories were somewhat repetitive, altough from different voices in different environments. I think that misunderstood teen girls who have been through similar situations would benfit better from the reading of this book than most other people."
3,new ear cuff,"i love the delicacy of the gold, very feminine, however it is rigid and hard to adjust . i have a very small ear i wear it on and every time i wear it, it always falls off because i can't crimp the metal so it will stay in place. would hate to lose it."
4,Rez rocks,"If you are in tune with the modern 'rez' or wanna be, you should hear this music. It's the sound track to the modern Indian scene, that's the native American reservations if you don't know what the rez is. Keith Sicola is part rock, part pop and all Indian. Hear what a true American native original sounds like!"
4,"hartmann intensity 24""","we went on an adventure from buffalo to atlanta to houston to salt lake to atlanta to buffalo, and there were no issues. What does that translate to: perfection. thanks"
3,Just OK,"Ok, not great. I read this to my son last night he didn't really seem impressed. Probably won't read this one much."
4,Light and entertaining reading,"The Gilded Chain tells the story of a young boy who is inducted into the elite group of Blades. After his induction, he expects to be able to protect his king and kingdom, but instead is bound to a snivelling noble whose claim on his time is being related to the mistress of the king.The politics of the kingdom in the novel are realistic, which is probably the best thing about the book. Duncan is clearly a skilled writer, and the book flows well and kept me hooked as a reader. I was less enchanted by the pacing-- it was a little distracting to have years flying by without warning in such significant pieces. I am curious how that will be continued or resolved in later books.The idea of the Blades is an interesting one. It will probably be worth picking up the second installment in the series."
1,Hurts your head.,"If you wear them for 5 minutes you head will start hurting. If you wear them for 2 hours or more ear wax builds up excessively. Don't forget to remove the wax before work. They squeeze the crap out of your head, cutting off circulation. These are so uncomfortable. Tried bending them so they won't be so tight and they broke in 2 places at one time. Now they need total modification in order to stay on my head. Might as well just get another brand."
2,Best of Friends,"To be honest I couldnt get into this one at all. . it was a struggle to finish which is unusual for me when it comes to Cathy Kelly Books.I mean the death of one of the character (wont say who) is spoken about throughout the whole novel, even though the characters didn't even seem to know her that well. The novel goes on like each of the characters have lost a family member. To make matters worse, the reader doesn't get a chance to get to know her either.Also, in some cases Cathy Kelly uses a lot of America language, which is grand, except she's Irish! Things like gas bill, 80 *F etc. Why? I know its a small thing.Anyways it wont stop me from reading Cathy Kelly books, usually her books are great, this one just didn't appeal to me. If you haven't read a Cathy Kelly book before, id start with something else."
4,Engaging Story of Friendships and Real Life,"This was certainly an engaging story of a group of women thrown together by geography and other circumstances. The story focuses on the individual women's stories and struggles, yet all of their lives are intertwined throughout the book. I was drawn in almost immediately and stayed interested throughout. This is great ""chick lit"", but I would say has more depth than much of traditional ""chit lit"". An overall great read."
4,IT DON'T COME EASY,"As an inveterate Beatles fan, I was naturally drawn to this book. Clayson does an admirable job of following Ringo from his early days in the rough Dingle section of Liverpool to his years as a Beatle and beyond.Clayson's use of quoted interviews with people who knew and worked with Ringo is what makes this book so effective. I like the way he portrays Ringo as approachable, as somewhat humble about his stellar success as one quarter of the world's number one band. This is definitely worth reading."
5,"A beautiful edition,at last, the pictures and life together!","For the first time we can see the story of Coco Chanel's life and the style it inspired side by side, in an elegantly produced, reasonably priced volume. Chanel called herself the first 20th century woman, and the fact that the way women dress today is due to her understanding of women, her independence and her fascinating life unfolds in Janet Wallach's narrative. Surely this is the least expensive Chanel one can buy and keep forever."
4,A great insight into the life of Chanel,"Undoubtedly, this is a great book. The illustrations and photographs alone are worth the hefty price tag. The use of wording and the excitement in the authors ""tone"" provides one with great visions and imagery of her escapades and adventures.The details are pretty good...however, there are, at times, several bits of information written about Chanel that is not accurate. Having read dozens of books and just about anything and everything ever printed about Mademoiselle, it struck a chord knowing that many people will read this book and believe that is the way certain things happened in her life, be it what she said or did, or did not do. And while it may not have necessarily meant to be a comprehensive, didactic text, allow yourself the pleasure of reading several books about Chanel to get a better understanding of one of the greatest women of all time."
5,simply great,"Some reviewers have commented on the instructions: let me say from my experience with origami instructions and illustrations, this book is definitely on the easy-to-understand end of the spectrum! I would consider myself an advanced beginner folder, and I have had absolutely NO problems making any of these boxes, which should be sufficient testament to the ease of instruction. If you're new to modular folding, do what I did to practice, and cut down some regular copy paper to 8 1/2 inch squares--your pieces will be nice and big and you can see what's going on. I just dig up a pile from the recycling bin at work before I head home.... You will be pleasantly surprised at the range of boxes you can make with this book. And that's really the joy of unit origami! One warning: it's ADDICTIVE AS HECK! Tomoko Fuse is the queen of modular origami, and this book is a reason why!"
2,A Challenge!,This gets 2 stars only because it is a great movie to put you to sleep(evenif your not sleepy)..Otherwise if you think you cannot ever bedepressed ... I challenge you to watch this one.....
5,"Hard to watch, impossible to forget","Before you skip on to the next review (or movie), read this. If you appreciate artistic subtlety, the nuance of the unsaid, and beautiful black and white imagery, you should watch this film. I saw it at Telluride Film Festival, and to be honest it was difficult to watch, but I couldn't stop watching. Beautifully done, luxurious in its sparse storytelling, this film haunts me today after one viewing."
5,Durable and fun,Bought this for my wife when we were dating a few years back...still holds up well and was well worth the purchase.
3,not as many great pictures that I expected,The book was in a good shape and that's what I was looking forBut I was disapointed by the pictures
4,A very good christmas album that got me in the christmas spirits already in November!,"Lee Greenwood is one of my favorite singers of all time, and like most other people, I love christmas music. To combine these two elements can of course only result in success. All though I would have wished it to be a LITTLE more country and a LITTLE less jazz (which is why I give it 4 instead of 5), the cd is still very good and Greenwood sings as good as ever. So please note that the 4 stars are just because i'm not that big of a fan when it comes to jazz music, if you like that then this cd has got to be a 5 star cd for you.I also would have loved to see Greenwood try a few more traditional christmas songs as Silent Night and Little Drummer Boy, but the ones I got on the cd are also very good and several of them I had never heard before.As much as I love Richard Marx, I'd rather buy this christmas album than the one he released this year."
1,The wall switch works much better,"I bought several from different sources. None work very well. The furthest they reach for me is about 15 feet. And more often, about 2 feet. To make matters worse... I have the signal repeater that is supposed to increase it's range! They don't work very well. I can get about 30 or 40 feet with the wall switch and the repeater combined."
5,Great series,We really like Monarch of the Glen and these series arrived in quick and excellent condition from Amazon.com. Would recommend if you like scottish humor!
2,Decent Thriller,"This is essentially two books; an espionage story set largely in Portugal during WWII and a police procedural in contemporary Portugal. The WWII story sets the stage for the contemporary mystery. Wilson is a competent writer and each story is handled fairly well. These two threads are brought together at the end in a needlessly complicated conclusion. There is a good deal of gratuitous, both in the conventional sense and in the sense that it doesn't really advance the plot, violence and sex. Books with repeated scenes of rape are usually not very appealing."
4,My thoughts about A Small Death in Lisbon,"I love novels that have some historical value and a geography lesson. This international thriller had some of each and a rather unusual plot with lots of twists and turns. For a long time it was like reading two novels, flipping back and forth between them; but since it is a single book, I knew they would eventually converge.On the down side there were a lot of foreign words that were totally unfamiliar. I am sure the story would have been better understood and appreciated if I knew them.If you are uncomfortable with harsh sex and abuse you may not like this novel."
1,don't waste your money,"The book needs a lot of editing, a lot. I found the errors distracting. Terms appear from nowhere and are never explained. Don't bother using the index, it does not line up with the pages. How do you return a defective book!"
5,Great introduction to semantic web technologies,"This book is clearly organized and steps you through the technologies and ideas underlying the semantic web. Starts out with some basic concepts about the semantic web, goes on to describe XML -> RDF -> OWL -> logic/inference. It wraps it up with some examples and ontology engineering.Great introduction with enough references to help the more advanced reader find what they're looking for."
5,Very good book,"I usually expect any book coming out of a university to be highly theoretical and math-centric, but this book is neither. It's a clear exposition of software radio concepts and issues, with a great deal of attention paid to signal generation and processing. Unlike another reviewer, I was happy to see 70 pages devoted to smart antennas, since any multi-protocol transceiver operating in the GHz range is going to need them. The exposition is clear, well developed and well written. More editing would have helped, but overall highly recommended."
5,Expectations fulfilled!,"I bought this dual pack with the cd ""Train"" And ""Drops of Jupiter"" I bought this under the category ""used"", and I was worried that it wouldn't work at all. But the cd's was sealed, unopened, and carefully handled. I got this mail from Amazon I should expect to recieve my package two months later I placed my order. But no worries, I recieved it within two and a half week. Over to the MUSIC! Oh, I have heard it before, but in some way, I feel more connected to the songs when I have them in a fysical object, not just as a file. For those who haven't heard of Train before, beware, this is the best music there is. The specific cd's ""Train"" and ""Drops of Jupiter"" contains so much fantastic music! I also bought theyr live album ""Alive at last"". Also an increadible album. I can see no reason at all not to buy these cd's. Train for the win! :-)"
5,Haunting of Amelia,"Haunting of Amelia,This is an excellent movie for those who are doubting life in general for whatever reason.This movie can help them refocus if they are in lifes limbo or if they just want to watch a great movie."
4,Impress with this cd,"Loved the whole cd, I think she has an excellent voice, she's happy I can hear it in her music, she lay it down with this one. You go Lil Mo."
2,This album,This album was not so good I only like 4 out 16 songs out of I would really listen to these samples before purchasing. This album was a big dispointment.
2,"This is a barbecue recipe/cookbook, not a smoking how-to","If you've bought a water smoker and want to smoke things the long way (3-5 hours) this book is not for you. This book is 98% recipes and most are for things that take 20 minutes to an hour to cook. Out of the 420 pages or so, 34 deal with how to cook or other things related to smoking. The rest are recipes for everything from hot dogs to oysters. 123 pages are devoted to sauces and accompaniments (muffins, etc.).This may be a great recipe book (and I'll find out), but I was disappointed that it didn't have more on smoking."
1,Comes un done,Not only did it come apart the dog knew how to get her legs out even when it was snug as it could be do not buy
2,Not for me,"Waste of time in my mind, there were so many straps to connect that I could never figure out how to get it on the dog."
5,perfect!,I've only had this for about 5 days but i've been using it regularly. no complaints so far! And the mini ice cubes are cute.
3,"Kind of frustrating, but good for shots!","I originally got this because I live in a dorm and have a mini-fridge, so I wanted to make sure it fit into the freezer. Also, it was the cheapest I could find that had prime shipping.It's a pretty blue color, which matches its freezing ice function, but getting the ice cubes out of the tray can be VERY frustrating. You have to use your nail to individually remove each small piece, unless you crack it and poor it into your cup, which results in a mess and a lot of lost ice cubes. On the bright side, these ice cubes fit perfectly into a tiny shot glass! :)"
4,Good Product,"Really great for the tiny ice cubes. I don't try to bend or anything to get them out. Instead I grab a big bowl and smack it gently, letting the ice cubes drop into the bowl. Worked well for me."
5,Love it,"Really amazing sound for such a small and light package. I used it with my keyboard, this includes bass & drum sounds. I do public speaking and used this in a small hall and it sounded great. I put it on a mike stand so set up is a breeze."
4,works well,"works very well for the most part...I have had products that cover better though.This does have a nice, bright glow to it."
1,AWFUL,"I got this concealer and was super excited. It concealed very well and I was totally pleased. But, the next day my eyelids were slightly puffy. I didn't worry and again applied the concealer. The next day my eyes were so puffy that I could only open them a little. Also, half of my face was bright red and very dry. I have never had an allergic reaction to anything before, so this was a first."
3,Love the Fondue,"If you want Chocolate fondue, this is the absolute best. It is easy to prepare, smooth, rich chocolate taste, and goes well with whatever you dip into it. The local stores don't carry it anymore so I ended up paying a ridiculous price plus outrageous shipping costs to provide it for New Year's Eve. I will make my own, less delicious one next year."
5,SO HAPPY TO FIND THIS,"I had bought one of these locally a while ago at Lowes or Home Depot. My house has a stairway with no switch at the bottom of the stairs to turn the light on. This device saved me from running wires and installing 3 way switches at the top and bottom of the stairs. It worked for about 4 years until i burnt it out by running a ceiling fan through it. My mistake. This unit WILL NOT FUNCTION WITH A CFL bulb(i tried it)OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN AN INCANDESCANT BLUB(example ceiling fan). To be fair this was stated in the instructions. So after i burnt out the first one, i went to buy another at the local stores and could not find any anwhere. One associate told me, ""sounds like a great idea, you should make that"" when i told him what i was looking for. So i searched amazon and lo and behold, I FOUND ONE and they sold it for less than i bought it 4 years ago! Yay happy ending!"
5,great,I use this as a suppliment for my marine planted tank. I've noticed a nice increase in color of my red algaes and nice growth on everything. Well worth the purchase if you need added iron for your plants or refugium.
2,Careful Now,"This is one your gonna have to think about before buying. It is not nearly as good as their first. It rocks out, but everything is very standard. There are some commercial efforts, but otherwise it just SLUGS togethor. Its hard to get specific because nothing stands out about it while listening. I'd see it live because I can see it rocking out, but these guys have the hardest time putting their live show on a disc. The lyrics need work guys."
3,Worthwhile,This instruction book has no video but the material is well written and easily understandable I liked the exercises and had fun with it I felt my money was well spent on this instruction book
5,Refreshingly Honest,"Actually, I found the non-sanitized and sometimes redundant nature of the coverage to be refreshingly honest.This is a book about a new field circling while getting a sense of direction. We very seldom get such an honest look into just how this sort of process happens. Instead, we get the bottom line version where everything obviously inevitably followed from what came before to the predestined conclusion -- in 20-20 hindsight.5 Stars for this one"
2,utterly disappointed.,"I bought Madden 07 for my PS3, and it was terrible...I bought into the EA hype machine once again this year when madden came out. I thought they may gone back and re-tooled. This game plays about as poorly as the old psone versions: controls are clunky, animations are reduntant, gameplay is unrealistic. Oh well I guess I will play NCAA which is much smoother and faster."
2,product has too many bugs,this video game has too many bugs and i suspect it may not be new. I was disappointed as i paid for and expected to have a new product.
2,gettting there but far from perfect,gameplay is pretty solid and fun but the countless bugs will drive you nuts... save your money and wait till next year...EA needs 3 or 4 generations to get it right...was going to get their upcoming NBA and FIFA games but will hold off because I have a feeling that the frustration level will be very high...
2,Should have been much better!,"Fumble, fumble and fumble...This is exactly the game almost summed up. I bought this game now regretting it. If you plan on buying this please read the other comments and decide if you should. I don't even now where to begin. The graphics were very disappointing. This is PS3 and sure feels like PS2. The computer player is so predictable...just don't plan on stopping it the last two minutes of every half and the last two minutes of the game. If I were you I would not get this except if you MUST have a football game, in which you will regret it. Think about getting another sports game.....oh what a waste of money!"
1,Thesis is wrong.,"I am not sure I am allowed to write a review without reading the book, but just on the basis of the back cover I know I don't need to read it. Rifkin seems to think hydrogen is an energy source. It isn't. There is no available supply of free hydrogen, so it needs to be seperated, for example from water. The energy needed to do this is equal to the energy subsequently released in a fuel cell. Hydrogen is therefore merely an energy storage device, like a battery. One might as well propose ""wound-up springs"" as an energy source."
5,Excelent CD,"I have listened to and enjoyed both Libera and Luminosa and found them both very enjoyable. This group of boys is outstanding with their voices blending beautifully. This is my first encounter with Robert Prizeman and after some hesitation at the very non-traditional sound, these two CD's have become among my favorites. If I were to criticize anything about the CD at all it is that there is so little information about the choir or the songs in the cover booklet. I am eagarly awaiting this group's next offering."
5,"Hypnotic, Stunning, Soothing, Graceful...","The one thing that stands out bout this choir is the unrestrained beauty and spiritual gracefulness. I have some songs of theirs on my computer, but nothing so beautiful and complex and intricate as this. Voices that soar like a dove, and music that envelopes your entire soul, this album should not be overlooked by anyone who is 'afraid' of choral music or is not lookin for 'boys that sing like girls'. Luminosa has so much to offer to the listener(s), my favorite song on the whole album is Vespera, the soloist Steven Geraghty does the majority of the vocals on this song, and his voice simply flies. Utterly fantastic music, simply amazing!"
2,"Not packaged well, gashes in all deliveries!","For the price of the furniture from this company, we are satisfied with all of our son's items. (7 drawer dresser, crib) This item came improperly packaged, however. We tried 3 times, and the top (the only solid part other than drawer fronts) was gashed in the same place in all of the orders. Too bad!"
1,Selling Damaged Products!,"We really looked forward to assembling this dresser however, when we took out the first piece it has the same damage that others describe as gashes and took the color completely off. After reading other reviews it seems that this company is selling damaged or returned products which would explain the pricing. Very disappointing, I would give it negative stars if I could."
2,WAS a good book . . .,"The authors did a fantastic job of explaining similarities and differences between COBOL and JAVA, and even did a decent job of providing a good intro to object-oriented design. The examples, while being simple, are nonetheless well conceived and can easily be related to. I would unconditionally recommend this book to anybody trying to transition from COBOL to JAVA . . . except . . . it's out of date. It's based on the old JAVA 1.1, and there were major changes going to JAVA 1.2 (SWING being the biggy), and we're up to JAVA 1.3 now. Either get another book that's more current or wait for the next edition of this one."
2,No personal connection,"This book is designed for older readers, because of overall morbid aspect that the book takes. The illistrations are gruesome, and the storyline is not fluid. The story was not relatable without an Indian background."
1,poser,Once again we have a fake poser who has stolen the name of a real man who was killed at Little BigHorn. Same story as Finkle he escaped and found out on the plains during an indian war by a white family nursed back to health and instead of reporting in to the nearest army post just goes home. Sad thing is now some POS has placed a GAR marker on the fake Heaths grave in Pottsville PA. To be in the GAR you had to have served in the Civil War fake Heath in PA arrived in USA after the Civil War so now someone has stolen one of the GAR markers from one of over 50 Civil War vets buried in that cemetary and put it on this posers grave. I have alerted the proper people in Schuylkill Co to take care of that problem. If you like science fiction buy this book. If you respect veterans do not. The author had the audacity to take a pic of the grave in Pottsville with the GAR marker on it instead of taking the marker off the grave before he took the pic or perhaps he is the one who put the marker there.
3,"Some good points, some bad points","Beginners may have trouble following the drawings in this volume. The drawings were a disappointment when compared to the gorgeous photography in the center of the book. I also think Mr. Larousse was overly ambitious in presenting garnishes which require little or no skill next to those which are more involved or demanding. The sheer number of ""old"" ideas make the professional chef bored, and the more complex items will only serve to frustrate the beginner. The work itself is flawless, but much is lost in the translation."
5,Ruby Bridges,This is a great read-aloud book at any time of the year but particularly during Black History Month. The book illustrates how Ruby came to be the only black girl at an all white school and her attitude of love towards those who hated her. Marvelous book!
2,weird color,"The color description for the shoe I ordered was mocha--it is orange. I expect mocha to be brown, not orange. The heel on one shoe is different than the other--makes for uncomfortable walking--I would not recommend this style! Don't know what has happened to Rockport, they did have quality shoes."
4,Great ideas for small groups!,"Our small church will get a great deal of use from these plays. Simple staging, simple text, and simple messages!"
3,Should get a better focus,"Too much of this book that is supposed to be about Linux Security is instead about paperwork, or general computer security, as opposed to linux/unix security. There are many books out there that do a far better job helping you create user policies and all that paperwork that the folks in HR want to have for legal purposes. SANS has a wealth of this stuff, and it's better to just read/copy it from online if you need that stuff. Instead, I'd prefered that this book had more Linux security 'grit'.I'm not displeased with what is here, but the amount of the book that covers topics that are not useful or on point is dissapointing."
5,The astounding story of man,Don't miss this... fascinating DVD. This scientist traces our ancestors through DNA and after mapping the path of the human race he travels the path man took.He travels around the world meeting the people and proving we are all related. Wonderful!I wish all the schools had this one.
2,You won't be awake,"Awake isn't a good movie. The premise is fallible and the script straight out of a soap opera.The movie follows Clay. He has a domineering mother he can't stand up to and a beautiful girl he keeps hidden on the side. He also has a bad heart and a rare blood type. The story follows his relationship with his girlfriend and to some degree his mother and surgeon-friend as the story leads up to the movies only real selling point - the surgery and the instance of ""anesthesia awareness"" that follows. Unfortunately the story really doesn't do this event any sort of justice and glosses over it with Clay having a sort of mind-over-body moment and then his spirit leaving his body and cruising around the hospital eavesdropping on conversations.There is more to it, some plot twists you may or may not have seen coming and a finale that is anything but exciting. My advice, skip the movie and read the spoilers."
1,Horrible excuse for a movie,"This movie was horrible. I rented it because I thought that it sounded like an interesting plot. It was extremely slow, and it jumped to the boring parts very quickly.There were some sweet parts between Jessica Alba and Hayden. But it made a stupid turn around later.Watch this movie if your curious, but I suggest renting it first. I dont even believe it is worth the rental fee."
2,Too Many Gorgeous People for Its Own Good,"A protagonist who is 22, a super-rich King of New York Wall Street power broker...It's like watching a mature John Wayne play a gay interior decorator; it's just not believable! The plot was too implausible all around to work, and was even harder to accept coming from Jessica Alba and Hayden Christiansen. My wife and I were laughing at the scenes these two genetically perfect specimens had together--emoting in the bathtub; emoting in the rain.I really can't point out all the stupidities of this movie without blowing the plot. I felt like I was robbed of an hour and a half of my life. And what is Lena Olin doing in junk like this? Who ponied up the money for it?Arliss Howard's too-brief screen time was the best part of the movie."
2,The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078,"This movie gets two big thumbs up for eye candy and the background story. The plot and flow of the movie however are both weak. This film is based on phenomena of anesthetic awareness, something we saw for the first time, 15 years earlier in a Tales From The Crypt episode. It was a great episode and seemed like it should make a good movie, but this wasn't it. Awake moves very slowly and is pretty boring for the first 45 minutes or so, and after that it just jumps around. Hayden yelling at people who can't hear him, gets old, quickly, but it continues to go on and on and on. It has a good cast, its a great idea, but it's only a decent story, and much too slow for me."
5,my favorite book of childhood,"This is a book I loved as a child and still love. It's about a duchess who decides to surprise her family with a cake, with disasterous and hilarious results. The book fosters a love of kitchen creativity, as well as just being outrageously funny, as everyone blunders in trying to help improve the situation. It is written in verse, and I have read it to children of every age. Several children have told me it is a favorite of theirs, too. I would place this in the top ten books I would buy for children, along with the Curious George books, Dr Seuss, The Wheels on the Bus pop-up book, and Wild Child."
5,childrens book,This is an old one but so great. Such fun to read. I read it to my girls when they were young and will now read it to my grandson.
4,Corney But Great,"This CD is by no means a great album, you get some classic Christmas tunes done up electronic style. However there are a couple great tracks here to drop in a set during the holidays. If you're not a DJ, or a real fan of Christmas music, I'd probably skip this one, 'cause seriously how often are you gonna pop this one in the other 11 months out of the year. Anyways HAPPY HOLIDAYS!!"
5,Get This Album !,"I didn't even know who Bob Malone was until the night I saw him by accident a couple of years ago. I went to see the woman who opened for him. I forgot her name shortly after Bob took the stage, because I was in awe for two hours. I bought this album after the show because I wanted to hear what I heard live. This set pretty much nails it. Great stuff. Bravo!"
4,A good read,"Why is it that the hero is always someone who's slept with tons of people and the heroine is always a virgin? Whose fantasy is that? How come there's never a romance about two virgins made only for each other? Anyway, I liked the book overall. And I thought it was the best of the three in this series. I did like that, even though he'd been with many women in the past, there was no one for him like Devon. I thought the story also did a good job of introducing the characters in the next two books. One of my favorite SB books."
5,Hardback Edition,There is also a hardback as well as the paperback edition but I haven't read the hardback yet.
1,Contains No Economics,"There is no economics in this book. Just a lot of rambling nonsense. I advise potential buyers to use the ""Search inside this book"" feature on Amazon before spending any money on this title."
3,Remotes work fair for me,"Bought 4 remotes and 4 outlets, all worked but I had to ""play"" with them. There are 4 ""house"" settings in addition to the 8 channels. I couldn't get the remotes to do what I wanted until I changed those on both the remote and outlet pairs.The remotes work well at 30 to 40 feet but in the dark it is a little difficult to change channels. These seem to work better than other remotes I've had.Would I buy/recommend these? For the price and flexibility - Yes."
4,great but not recommended for sensitive skin.,Adhesive bond is super strong and it does it job. Stays in place even after sweat and everyday activities. Will leave irritations after a long period of time. May cause serious itching and irritations if applied everyday to sensitive skin.
4,it Works,"I bought this tape to cover my diabetic sensor, it is a small device and I did not want it to get pulled out. So far the tape is working great it holds the sensor in place. It works better than the plastic coverings that I tried."
5,great learning tool!,"This jigsaw puzzle book of animals, with puzzles and corresponding verbal descriptions on face-to-face pages, is an outstanding learning tool for children. It is to be highly recommended!"
4,Having horns as a rythm section...,In this case it works pretty well.The music flows and remains interesting from the beginning 'till the end.Recommended.
2,A Mixed Bag of Public Domain Cartoons,"Mill Creek Entertainment's ""Ultimate 150 Cartoon Festival"" showcases the usual public domain animation (Fleischer/Famous Studios, Van Beuren, Iwerks, etc.) with a few special exceptions. There is a hard-to-find copy of the Fleischer Color Classic ""Tears of an Onion"" (1938) - along with two Van Beuren gems from 1933, Tom and Jerry's ""Happy Hoboes"" and Cubby Bear's ""Croon Crazy."" Oddly enough, these aforementioned shorts are nowhere to be found on Mill Creek's ""Giant 600 Cartoon Collection."" In both instances, you must wade through an endless stream of made-for-TV clunkers such as ""The New 3 Stooges"" and ""Mel-O-Toons."" The print quality ranges from very good to nearly unwatchable."
3,Not impressed,"I was not impressed with this book. I purchased it because of the cd, but it is essentially worthless. The ""database"" for the guest list is difficult to add entries and it doesn't offer options to sort or print only portions of the list. The book is hardback which makes it difficult to make notes in it. (But there's not much space for notes anyway!) The book does offer some helpful tips and questions to ask when contacting vendors."
3,Medium.. really,"Medium was really like Large.. I wear medium for all brands.. but this was really a Large size. Quality was good,, bit pricy though...."
4,The Jigsaw Puzzle,"If you like jigsaw puzzles as I do, you must read this book. If you really love wooden jigsaw puzzles, buy the book today."
5,"Help me to see You, see me and know I am Yours alone!","Dennis Jernigan has been given this awesome gift to express the love God has for his children through music. This CD is inspiring and reassuring. Every Christian should listen and realize that we should be what God has called us to be: Chosen, New Creation, Trophies of Grace, Redeemed!"
5,Dennis just gets better and better,"This is an awesome CD. I have been listening to Dennis for several years now, and his growth in Christ is so evident. If you are ready to step into the Holy of Holies this is the CD to help you get there. Be ready to cry before the Lord as you praise Him. Keep running the Race."
3,KATELAND,"AN EYESORE..Its not a bridge of dreams for me. The SAN FRANCISCO BAY BRIDGE has long thin poles, that make up the sides of the bridge. And the crew was filming with those poles in front of the camera. That made the cars on the bridge look Blury, there were cars that had just come on to the bridge, i could pick them out to be cars, but all the cars any further up, were showing up as only big red blobs. All the lighting seemed very harsh. That is the Bridge lights, the City lights, and the Habour lights. I wasnt able to look for too long at all this. And they said this DVD has been filmed in High Definition as well. Do your your eyes a favour, turn away from it too."
1,Do not buy this bike,Do not buy it if you are not slim and short (I'm 5'10'' and 260 lb). That's bad example of a budget item. Saddle was broken at the third day. Pedal was broken at the fifth day. The Saddle tube is too short for an adult and I had to replace it. Front wheel is not straight. Brakes and shift are ugly.Now I know that it's beter spend $150 more and get really nice bike. Please don't repeat my mistake.
5,I'm Charmed,"Math has never been my strongest subject, but this book makes it absolutely fascinating! Posamentier is engaging and delightfully charms his readers with wonderful math puzzles. This book taught me more about math than I ever expected to learn. Quite the introduction to beauty and excitement of math!"
5,YUMMY,These are great! I ordered a mix of olives and onions from this seller and was very pleased with all the items. They shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. Great items for snacking or using in salads. Great value.
5,Giving me a new perspective into my children's behaviors,"Since reading this book,I am constantly reminded of what I have learned about the different temperments. I have learned other personality traits in college, marriage preparation etc. but it is good to review it after you have children. When you learn that some of the behaviors which occur over and over again are related to their temperment and how these traits can be useful. I highly recommend this as a quick read for all parents interested in bettering their relationship and parenting of their children. I especially love that it relates temperments to saints, the bible and spiritual growth. though I found the tally chart at the very back the best in determining temperments. I would recommend starting to read the end first."
1,Another book like this?,Didn't Tim LaHaye write a series of books about this very subject? Their information sounds very much like his.
4,Very Pleased!,"I was very pleased w/ this tote bag. It was bigger than I expected, which is a plus. Its roomy and has several convenient compartments which are perfect such as the 2 side pockets (water bottle), the back pocket fits books and magazines nicely and the cell phone compartment inside. Biggest plus the zipper closing, now all my stuff doesn't slide all over the floor of my car. I do believe I will be ordering a black one. My only con is the straps should be padded, would be the perfect tote!"
3,Luger holsters,"Book is as promised, state is good. It took a little bit long to get it through th customs in Holland, Europe."
4,Step by Step Outdoor projects,Good resource that covers a lot of relevant projects for the beginner or the advanced. I like that it has colored pictures which are easy to follow. I would definitely recommend this book to a first time home buyer.
2,Don't believe the 2003 hype!,"...Plain and simply, Threesome is about a woman, Sasha, and her bout with ""low self-esteem"". The book starts by introducing you to Sasha, who is knowingly having an affair with a married man. Sasha's dealings with men and relationships only goes down from there. She becomes the personal assistant to a young, up and coming athlete but fails to keep her professional relationship separate and apart from her sexual relationship and that becomesthe ruin of her consciousness, discipline, values and appreciation for a good man when one finally enters her life.Threesome, which is only 122 pages in length, while telling an interesting story seems to have been written hurriedly. The author gets straight to the point of action without much ""scene setting"". The book has surface elements of a great story idea but could have been developed a lot more. On a scale from 1-10 with 10 being a great read, I'd rate this book a 4."
5,Twisted Relationships,"What a twisted life with three twisted relationships. Sasha had no respect or very little for herself .It appeared she was a magnet for unavailable men.First Cole a marriage man, then her boss which had a fiance, then when she met Trent.Whom she was not willing to tell him about the ghosts that haunted her.She stood a better change with Trent especially since he loved her. This is a Must Read and a 5* in my book . I can hardly wait for this author's next book. It was a twisted story but one I enjoyed to the fullest. Did I mention it was a pageturner which was steaming with love scenes."
3,Don't Believe the Hype!,"I have to say that I am somewhat disappointed in the storyline of the book. There are lots of hot sex scenes, which I enjoyed, but I don't think the writer delivered the story in a way that kept me excited or longing to know what happened next. The writer seemed to jump subjects quick, seeming like she was trying to squeeze some thoughts into this very short novel. It just depends on what type of author's work you are use to reading. I just discovered Brenda Hampton and am reading all her books back to back. So sometimes that can throw a reader off when a new author's skill level doesn't equate to what you are use to. Don't get me wrong, the book is worth reading, but don't expect to have your socks knocked off. If you want to read a book of short stories that are all the bomb, read ""Around the Way Girls"". It is off the hook!"
1,Not universal,"You would think this would be a universal thing, but no such luck. It's too small to fit in my Saab, so it cant grip the sides and falls out."
3,cute,"this is a very cute cut, but really should be lined with something....not discreet enough to use without a bra."
2,Cheaper,Was too small to fit my present decorative rain gauge. I could have purchased this for the same price in my city area. Not happy with product size too small and the diameter was not given in the description only that it measured 5 inches. All rain small rain gauges measure 5 in. of rain. Was not worth the cost of returning.
1,Feeling Ambushed,"I ordered the Ambush tester from FragranceNet expecting to get a full bottle minus the un-needed packaging. What I received was really old, used or a 2nd from the manufacturer.....Follow-up: When contacted they were all to happy to send a replacement bottle...It arrived in worse condition. Both bottles are only filled to the Ambush lettering, but the second bottle has chunks floating in it. The chunks help me understand the color. Both bottles are a reddish tint not the color shown in the picture, so I'm suspecting they're old and the metal on the pump is rusting inside."
1,Don't Like It!!!,"If you buy this book with the expectations of learning Photoshop, forget about it. The book just dosen't capture your attention, it makes you more confused then you were before you bought it. The authors try and make you learn by using old fashioned pictures and cartoons, a good idea, but it dosen't work.I really tried for about 2 weeks to learn Photoshop, with the help of this book. I learned more by navigating the program by myself.I don't like this book."
2,I'm not that dumb,"On technical merit alone this is a good beginners book. However, while I usually enjoy the casual tone of for Dummies books this one just goes too far. The authors' allusions are silly, sometimes even patronizing and clutter up the message. I ended up scanning most of the pages trying to find the real information. If the authors had cut out all their cute little touches the book could have been half the size and twice as effective. I would recommend this book only in conjunction with buying another Photoshop book that sticks to the subject."
4,Photoshop 7,Great book; gets me through the tough stuff with very little verbage and very understandable.
5,Wow....,"I was kind of concerned ordering my textbook on Amazon, especially from an independent seller. I've heard horror stories in the past and was afraid of what I might find in the mailbox. Well I went through all of that for nothing. The book came quickly and in excellent condition. If it wasn't for the used sticker on the spine of the book I would have thought it was new. I'm very happy with my purchase."
1,Horrible Book,"The newest edition still has information that was out of date when the book was originally published. It seems like these authors updated only the bare minimum, the stats and laws.This book is called substance abuse, and in the first chapter and a half goes on to define everything except ""abuse."" If they did define ""abuse"" then they could not get away with the things they were writting, some would be misleading and some would be wrong.They clearly have an agenda of thie own in writting the book, their own opinions, and not an object view.Thomas Harrison, Ph. D. in his 2007 class used the last version of his text, but also needed to recommend 4 other books to his students to get the points accross. While I applaud him for not assuming he knows it all, this book is truly not a good tool for a generalist trying to practice."
5,Excellent,These movies are as great as I remember seeing them on PBS several years ago. I received them both in only a few days and im very pleased with them. Thank you to the shipper and I would highly recommend buying from him.
3,"Good T&A tape, similar to Nude Basketball","The tape is basically a 3-on-3 touch football game played in a large backyard by some (emphasis on some) good looking nude women. The beginning of the tape has them doing calisthenics and warming up topless, and then nude. The lone brunette commentator also strips nude and appears on occasion throughout the tape. Some good slow-mo sequences of replay, but otherwise the game footage is a joke. No halftime like on the nude basketball tape. The nude basketball tape has better looking women all around. I recommend getting this on the DVD w/nude basketball for less than both VHS'. Once the ""game"" starts the novely wears off. The game is similar to what one would organize at a picnic or BBQ.At least the women are completely nude in the game, unlike the older Buck Naked Football VHS, where they are only topless."
1,Does not really sound like the same music from the Sopranos,"Basically the music does not sound the same as the music from the Sopranos series, don't know if it was a different singer, certainly not worth the money"
2,Please!,"Stacy's been so busy that it's been almost a full year since her last sexual encounter. She has one week before she becomes ""revirginized."" In several disasterous attempts at trying to avoid this at all possible costs, she fails miserably.I was thinking that she was challenged by some supernatural love force from reading the back of the book. Instead, she is just told by her best friend that she would be a virgin again after a year of no sex. Why would she follow his advise about things if she's as independent as she claims?The book actually wasn't too bad until the end. The last night before reclaiming her virginity, almost every person Stacy tries to have sex with during the previous week comes together and states their case for wanting to be with her. It's like deja vu of the end of ""There's Something About Mary."" That was really the only super hokey part.Read it if you must, but I would and could find better things to fill my time with."
2,Virgin alert,It was not what I expected it kind of dangled in the air in some chapters and I was happy when I finished because I had other books to read.
1,Yuck.,"Having read both The Accidental Virgin and Douglas Adams' Hitchhikers' Guide to the Galaxy, I have to say that I find Hitchhikers' more believable, with more realistic situations and true-to-life characters than this piecemeal work of . . . um . . . fiction."
3,"Fun-filled, laugh out loud fun, with a painfully dull ending","I enjoyed this book immensely. BUT, the ending was horrible. Why Valerie, why did you end it like that? The story flows through the life of the ""accidental virgin"". Or soon to be, if she doesn't step on it. A fun-filled book that really lets you laugh out loud at the humorous, and somewhat torturous life of Stacy Temple.I think I was just expecting a bit more from this somewhat formulaic story. The characters are all there, and the story definitely unfolds in a very unique tale, but it seems we never really step free from the cliche ridden path. I loved it, but I hated it all the same."
3,Cute book,"Wasn't as funny as other people have stated. Although, it did have some real funny parts. And some pretty steamy parts too! Didn't expect that!!! But I would recommend to a friend :)"
1,"Nice toy, but feel deceived","My 7 year old son loves these types of toys, however, as a parent I feel that I have been deceived. I bought thuis product for a birthday present for my son to unwrap. When I received the product, it was in an entirely different box and did not look like the product's description. It came in a plain box (Not a display box as shown)and the printing on the box looks like someone did it on an inkjet printer. The appearance almost looks as if the product was used. Needless to say for the price I was disappointed"
5,Excellent Candy,I was very pleased with Haribo Rattlesnakes. I had bought them because my daughter was coaching an FLL Robotics teamed named the Rattlesnakes Robotics. We passed them out to the other teams at the competition.
1,disappointing,"This is a very good resource for a beginning beader! Good pics, excellent directions, nice explanations. However, for an experienced beader, it has nothing to offer and there is nothing ""new"" in it that isn't already in many other bead books. It does not inspire."
3,"It's OK if you are new to town, enjoy","When we lived in Atlanta this book provided some great ideas on places to go visting. But I never felt if provided the richness I might have hoped for, and we were occassionally dissapointed in the locations. If you are new to town, I would pick this up."
5,GREAT!!!,Brilliant piece of art! As if Andy Warhol made a found footage horror film! Recommended for the strong performance by Mark McGerry.
1,HORRIBLE!,"This is not even a movie. It is a scam to get money from people. The whole video is comprised of some dumb, lunatic wannabe guy making faces, screaming, etc. in front of a video camera for an hour. The people that sell this scam crap, lying and taking advantage of others should be made to shovel cow dung with their hands for about a week. DO NOT buy this dvd! I hate I even had to give it 1 star......maybe I can leave it blank."
5,So so so worth it.,"I have almost no memory of my childhood, except this! So now, I pass this gift along to my son. It's one of the original pieces of art which helps/aids kids in understanding a bit about the bible. This are 3 separate DVDs in one case, each about 25mins. My son is four months away from turning 5. He loves it, and even me with my busy schedule took time off to watch it once again. Great packaging, great memories and the music and theme and message are true and constant and effective. It's nice that I was able to find this again. So simple but so effective for my kid and gets him making comments and asking questions. One thing at least, I know some lessons will stick with him just as they stuck with me. Seriously, it might not be 'techno advanced' like todays cartoons but if you can and desire to some help in your child forming interest in God and the bible and its stories, get it. God bless."
4,Great content and even better layout,I was really pleased by this book. It's not overly technical so it's good for sermon preparation. And it's broken into the lectionary passages so it's not too much material to get through.
1,Mislead,"I just received this product a few days ago and the bottle says nothing about it being organic! ""Certified organically grown"" is nowhere to be seen on the bottle! wtf?! Also, I am disappointed because these capsules have gelatin in them and I am a vegetarian! The product description has no information about the capsules containing gelatin.Very misleading!"
4,Helps with acne!,"I'm 31 years old and I get bad hormonal/cystic acne. Aside from taking prescription drugs, which also came with side effects, Burdock root is the only thing that really seems to work for me. It doesn't completely eliminate all acne, but it prevents me from getting cystic acne, which is pretty awesome."
5,Great filter for your body,"Not sure how it work, maybe by alkalinizing, but this will rid you of gout, neutralize alcohol in your system and helps your liver with any other toxin. Reduces water accumulation, achy muscles and joints. But you must take this regularly and it takes a while for it to begin working as it's more of a preventative.People in Japan eat Burdock Root every day."
5,Makes me feel great,This product makes me and my boyfriend feel great. I purchased it for my eczema and it works wonders. I feel more energetic and healthier since taking it. It made me feel very funny the first few times I took it so I know its some powerful stuff. I will continue to take burdock root. I purchased this from Vitamin Shoppe online and find it funny that it was cheaper to order online even with shipping costs than to purchase at my local Vitamin Shoppe.
3,Works great until XP SP2 walks into the room,"My home office is a mixture of Mac, Windows, and wireless network environment. The installation went well on both the Mac (OS X 10.2) and one PC (XP SP1), and I have assigned a fixed IP address to it althoug dynamic IP address works well, too.Immediately ran into trouble of using its scanning function after I've installed the driver and MFC Pro Suite onto my 2nd PC (XP SP2). The solution center on the Brother website does not offer too much help, neither they have respond to my email. And seems like there is no certified drivers available for SP2 from Brother for the moment. So now the only way to work around it is to scan the document by using the 1st PC then transfer it to the second PC which I am using most of time.Besides this hassle, I think this machine is the best one in the market for its price and functionalities, and I will highly appreciate if someone here can share the solution of dealing the scanning trouble with XP SP2."
2,Multifunction? Malfunction!,"I would strongly recommend that the buyer truely beware of refurbished products. The company that refurbishes them ""Doesn't"" test them thoroughly. Copy/Scan/photo works great but the fax is locked up. That was my main purpose of purchasing this device so I don't have to go out and fax. I'm stuck with a real piece now until I can budget for something that works."
2,Be aware of ink costs,"Purchased this all-in-one almost a year ago. Works fine as long as I have lots of ink on hand. Even with a full black ink cartridge, if any of the other ink cartridges are empty (yellow, blue or red), you cannot copy, print or receive faxes in black and white. Also seems to use alot of the three colors even during a period of mostly black and white copying."
4,Great Machine!,"After trying three different Multifunction machines, (2 HP's and 1 Epson) and returning them, I've finally found one that does what it is supposed to do. I currently have a Compaq laptop and Powerbook G4. This printer was a breeze to set up on both. The scanning feature is wonderful. All of my scans have come out true to the original. The fax works great, never had any trouble sending or receiving. The only problem I can come up with is that when you are printing color documents, they can be pretty slow. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase."
2,well its oookkkk,This is a good CD if you are a BEGINNER. If you have had any experience with tap dancing then it may be a little sslllooww but other than that it is an ok CD. I wouldnt really recommend it though.
3,A BIT DISAPPOINTING,"Purchased this item to remove pet hair from short pile area rugs in my home. My little shedder is a Golden-Cocker mix and has a long, thick coat. This will pull some fur, but requires a significant amount of time. If you need to de-fur carpets, best to purchase a stiff, short bristle carpet rake similar to those used by professional carpet cleaners."
3,It's okay,I purchased this broom because I have a dog and two cats and a huge problem with HAIR! The broom is okay but doesn't really do a great job on carpets although it's a great general broom. The small hand brush that came with it is good on furniture and stairs.I probably wouldn't recommend it for hair removal.
2,Boooo,Ineffective items. Small brush removes zero fur from a Sheltie and long handled broom requires lots of labor to remove hair from area rugs. Stopped using them already due to they are a waste of time.
2,Crummy drawer glides,"Absolutely beautiful piece of furniture. The bead-board sides, scrolled accents, and warm finish make this piece look truly ""rich"" (and not too cutesy). Unfortunately, I was very disappointed in how [inexpensive] and flimsy it felt at the store. The drawers are on crummy metal side gliders. Doesn't feel like the expensive piece it is, or looks like. On the plus side, the drawers do have 'stops' on them (so the can't be pulled all the way out by little ones)."
4,good book,i like this book a lot. it gives you theme party ideas with out being cheesey. very chic and classic ideas.
4,Great book with many helpful hints,"Leave it to an entertaining powerhouse like In Style to deliver time and time again. This book gives great hints that come from celebrity party planners. Tips on invitations, menu, decor, music and much more. The book even goes on and tells you what to do two months before the party, one month, two weeks, one week, day before, etc. Definately a great gift book. Many delicious beautiful quick recipes."
4,"Ticks like a time bomb, works like a charm","Yes, the ticking is louder than I'd want in my bedroom. I bought my two for bathroom and barn, so not a big problem. They are easy to read and look nice. Good value."
2,Loud ticking is reallly annoying,"I found the loud ticking as the second hand moves around the clock to be irritating. I had the clock in my kitchen but it was so loud that I focused on the clock rather than my cooking. Even while reading in my bedroom, I heard the clock loud and clear from the next room. Needless to say, I'll be looking for another clock. Living with this clock reminded me of the maddening heartbeat in Edgar Allan Poe's ""The Telltale Heart."" No thanks!"
1,Does not keep accurate time,Got the clock about a month ago. After changing the battery 3 times it still does not keep the right time. It losses about 5 minutes every week. I even set it 5 minutes fast so at the end of the week it is accurate and I only have to reset it every 2 weeks doing this. What a pain! Contacted the seller and got a full refund including shipping. Great cutomer service. Would buy from again just not this clock!
1,All stopped working within a few months,I purchased 5 of these clocks for my clinic and they all stopped workingwithin a few months. I would not recommend these even though they are very inexpensive.
1,"Looks nice, not poor quality","First one arrived with one of the hands broken. Amazon quickly replaced it - thank you. The second one lasted few weeks before it started falling behind. It is now around 6 hours or so off. I missed the 30-day return policy. So, I think I will throw it in the garbage."
3,Gangsta Boo is on top of her game,"Gangsta Boo has proved that she can stand alone. With her latest single effort she is still on top of her game. I love Nasty Trick, but what caught my attention was ""Where dem dollars at?' bounce remix. It is even better than the original. I suggest you get this. An excellent choice to add to your collection!!"
3,A Bit of a Disappointment,"This was an okay book...something to keep you entertained on the long train ride to work. However, a 4 year old could have guessed the ending."
5,A Pleasant Surprise,"I must confess to having trepidations about buying a replacement toner cartridge at 1/5th the cost of an original.But one month later, all remains in order, and we are entirely satisfied with the results. Clarity and depth of tone are excellent. However, the original Canon cartridge lasted several years, so the jury is still out."
1,"Next time, I'll buy the real thing!","This ink cartridge looks like the Canon, but it did not work like it. It was noisy and produced nothing but a blotchy, streaky mess. I have used the Canon cartridges for many years and thought I would try to save money buy purchasing this less expensive brand which has been very disappointing."
5,incredible,"this is a great book. The author had a bad eating disorder, was a sex addict, was a con, liar, swindler, gambling addict, and was suicidal. He explains what was going on in his head and what he thought might have triggered these issues. He showed just how low someone can fall....essentially losing everything.......but yet was able to recover. this was a truly inspirational book!"
4,"Works - 2"" longer than OEM","Good quality. I would say that each was about 2"" longer than the stock wires on my 1999 Chevy Astro. Not necessary, but not really a problem."
3,Interesting but not always great,"Uri Caine covers a lot of ground with his Goldberg Variations, but it is not a uniformly great and varied set of treatments. Some strike me as far more successful than others, and some bear little or no connection to Bach. Vocalist David Moss's appeal totally eludes me. For me, his odd sounds ruin some otherwise successful tracks. There's a difference between being unusual and interesting, and being odd and dull, and I find Moss odd and dull here, and irritating without being stimulating. It is tempting to simply applaud Caine for being audacious and risk taking, but this could have been edited down to one disc and been far more compelling. There's a difference between being prolific and being creative, and I think that the line is crossed here toward the merely prolific."
4,Enchanting book,"This book is the first book of the Goddess of the Sea series. I found it enjoyable, a couple of slow parts, but all in all a good read. I will continue with book 2 of the series. The book was shipped quickly and arrived in excellent condition."
4,Pretty darn good,I really enjoy Ms. Cast's style of writing...her descriptions are wonderful; and I feel like I am RIGHT there. Very enjoyable reading.
5,Different is always good!!,I kept debating whether or not to get it but I am glad that I did. I loved the story. It was well written and loved the characters. I felt like I was in the world with them. I cant wait to read the second book.
1,Yuck!!,"I love protein shakes but not ones that taste like pure chemicals! I couldn't stomach these because of the after taste. I tried to pawn them off on my coworker but after trying one, she didn't want any more. I don't recommend them because of the taste and if you read the ingredients it is full of chemicals."
1,Pure Protein Shakes,"I love Pure Protein Bars. They taste great. However, the Pure Protein Shakes were horrible. I took two sips and threw the whole case in the trash. Horrible after taste and initially they taste awful too. Why cant someone come up with a ready to drink high protein less calorie drink that tastes good? Is that too much to ask? I'd be happy to work with someone who wants to listen to what people want in a protein drink. I've had lapband surgery and need to have a certain amount of protein per day. Since I can't eat meats and other solid sources of protein like I used to, I need to supplement my intake with drinks. Help!!!"
1,Never Received!!!,This CD has not been received despite numerous e mails to Seller. Will try and remember to review it if it ever is delivered.
5,The best greatest hits EVER!,"This Steely Dan is a must have for music fans who just got in to Steely Dan! Every song is a highlight on the CD, but maybe they could have remasted but who cares! Even though it is an import, and you'll pay more for it, you get what you expected for your money! Classic Steely Dan! This is a better compolation than ""Decade of Steely Dan"", minus such other classics like ""FM"", ""Deacon Blues"", and probably, that's all!"
2,rugs,"these rugs are pretty and they go well in my kitchen, but they have no latex backing on them and I almost slipped and fell..........not good for a 64 yr. old. For the price you would think they could add a little non-slip backing so you could use them anywhere."
5,Sound of the Peruvian Andes,"I used many of the songs from this CD for my iMovie of my family's trip to Machu Picchu last year. Each song is beautifully arranged and played. I was going to use ""El Condor Pasa"" (Daniel Alomas Robles) for my video of the Temple of Condor, but decided that it was more fun to use it on a scene of a lone llama walking slowly down the ancient stone stairs to drink water. The slow rhythmic melody of this song was perfect for that scene! Many of the other songs were equally fitting for my trip to Peru. Cesar Villalobos, the creative director and founder of the Inca Son, is obviously very gifted and very talented. It's s shame that he has so many personal problems. I hope he'll overcome his demons and make more beautiful music. This CD is a wonderful representation of the Peruvian Andes. Highly recommended!"
5,Just what I needed,"Save money, buy from Amazon! Parts are genuine ACDelco parts. Fixed the check engine light on my truck. Replaced this and the partner canister solenoid at the same time. Previous owner had run it in extremely dusty conditions. Not necessary to re-route the filter that's recommended by the dealerships."
1,Way too long,"The length of these pants were much, much longer than shown. See the other reviews. It looks like everyone is having the same experience."
4,Gratitude and gratefulness,"This is a very good album with very mature playing from S Wilson, T Bowness and a handful of excellent musicians. Michael Bearpark, a very good guitar player gives us an excellent lead on the first tune (title track). The Space bass of Peter Chilvers also comes in good on 2 or three tracks.Roger Eno contributes with Harmonium in 'Photographs of Black & white'.Wilson and Bowness collected recordings done between 2001 and 2003 to give us the great record this is; considering it follows the powerful Returning Jesus of 2002.A very mature record for very mature audiences.Hats off in a Big way to S. Wilson and T Bowness for this stellar album."
5,simple and yet profound...,"This book has been a blessing to read. Foster came through as simple, and yet profound in his writing style; there was ample references to scripture, and Foster brings modern times into perspective with long held biblical spirituality; I plan to reread this book over again."
2,DO NOT BUY THIS,"I bought this distribution ground to use on my brother-in-laws 65' Cadillac.When I went to install it the 4 gauge inlet was a whole 1/16"" smaller than the positive distribution block(different company)I had. There was literally no way to get all the wire to fit in the ground distribution. The 8 gauge side fit no problem, butI'm extremely disappointed with the miss leading add.DO NOT BUY THIS if you need a 4 to 8 gauge distribution block!!!"
1,Fluff content,"There are lots of nice terrier pictures but there is nothing here that you can't get from a Google search. I also don't think you can buy a ""handbook"" on a dog...they are not appliances!"
2,Boring Head Holes Vary,I have to rework this head due to the tool holding holes vary in dimension & won't accept some of my tools. I had this same issue with another vendor. They probably all come from the same place. Get the seller to verify hole dimensions prior to purchase.
4,Lots of plans to dream over,"I could probably do without all the plans for A-Frame homes, but there are still enough other plans here to dream about over a cup of tea."
1,stay away,"I purchased this LCD monitor last year and paid $1,050.00 including tax. Less than one year later the monitor suddenly lost half it's viewing screen. I contacted Maxent and spoke to Rick who told me that even though the monitor was covered by it's warranty I would have to pay to ship it to California ($127.24 not including insurance)and then wait 2-3 weeks for it to be repaired and shipped back. The kicker was that in order to get it fixed I would have to fax them the original receipt which I couldn't locate. While I recognize that having misplaced the receipt was my fault, I felt that Maxent was being inflexible because I had the canceled check showing the purchase date. Anyone considering a Maxent product should realize that if it breaks during or after the warranty period, they will pay a considerable amount just to get them fix it."
3,Super Reader,"Rhodan and a select band, including some of his more powerful mutants are looking for the secret of immortality still, or cell rejuvenation if you want to put it that way.This is leading them on a long and winding chase, complete with powerful being and cryptic riddles. They end up in the middle of a barbarian siege, and even time travel."
3,"Well, its pink alright","The bible was a bit smaller than what I expected to get.And when I got it, the suede on the front cover was damaged. As for the bible part, well I like to highlight parts of my bible, but you can't do that with this one because the pages are so thin. They also tear really easily. And the font is really small. Overall, its not that bad. I recomend it to anybody that likes Pink."
2,poor sound,"While a good performance of great music, this disc shows its age. New digital sound is much better. But that is probably reflected in its low price. ."
5,Get a Handel,"This work may not be as well known as Handel's Opus 6, but the music is just as delightful."
5,Works!!,It takes just a few mimutes to set up and adjust but if pulling more than 2-3 bullets is well worth it. Lead semi wad cutters do not allow enough surface area for the collet to maintain it's grip. For other bullets it beats a kinetic puller hands down.
3,cam lock bullet puller,"I can find nowhere on this products advertisement where they tell you it is not complete, and therefore useless, without the collet specific to the bullet caliber you wish to pull.So when you order this product, it come incomplete, and therefore useless without one of i think 20 or so different sized collets. And to make matters worse, amazon does not carry ANY of the collets for this product, and out of 25 gun websites i know of i could not find the collets listed for sale anywhere.So impossible to accurately rate a product that is incomplete and therefore useless to you. I suppose ""waste of money"" would be my review"
4,An exciting book for all ages.,"Jacqueline Woodson's book, Lena, was a very adventurous and exciting book to read. This book would appeal to students of any age. It is about two sisters, Lena and Dion, who run away from their abusive father shortly after their mother died. The book later goes on to explain their troubles and many adventures on their way to find their mother's relatives. Lena and Dion can not afford to make one wrong move. Will they ever make it to find Mama's relatives? Find out in this unforgettable tale of Lena and Dion as they travel the trail to make their dream come true."
2,Not efficient for cleaning my upholstery,"I have a cat who loves sitting on the back of an armchair to look out the back window - hence, the chair gets covered in cat fur. Like other reviewers here, I found myself going through a ton of lint rollers to stay on top of things, so I purchased this product hoping for an alternative cleaning method. I don't know if it's how fine my cat's fur is or if it's the texture of the armchair or if it's the product, itself, but it has been less-than-useful in cleaning. The fur doesn't stick really well to the brush and then, because of the static, it's tough to pull off - I feel like I end up with just as much fur on me and in the air and I have to go over the chair a dozen times. I have officially retired this product and bought a vacuum cleaner with an upholstery attachment - much better! For grooming the cat, I have a FURminator and really love it, almost as much as the cat does."
3,get a furbinator,"I have a furbinator already, but thought it might be better to have something with gentler teeth. I guess this is ok, and it is gentler, but if you want the fur out get a furbinator."
3,Art Nouveau In Cross Stitch,"First of all, the summary on the page has nothing to do with this book. The summary is talking about a stencilling series - this is cross stitch. This is a small, appealing book with a number of nice art nouveau style cross stitch projects. I'd recommend this as an inexpensive addition to your cross stitch library. Projects range from small (peacock trinket box) to large (Tiffany style window, Mucha style head). Some are whole stitches only, others (the Mucha in particular) use partial stitches to create the typical flowing curves of this style."
5,"Low Cost, High Quality",This battery replaced my HP battery for my camera. To buy the battery from HP was significantly more expensive than to buy this replacement. This battery has proven to be reliable and long lasting. Very happy with this product.
2,Pipe dream sales approach...,"Stephan Schiffman covers quite a few strategies for closing the sale in this book but I found it to be lacking. Too much of the same old approaches to selling rather than what works (like profiling your customer by personality and catering your sale to their temperament.) If you've read any of his previous works, you'll find information recycled here.All the best!Bill White[...]"
2,More of the same,"Why do I buy these books? More of the same ""sales strategy"" books. If you've read one you've read them all."
4,Excellent!,"This is Tom Petty's first album without his Heartbreakers and since the initiation of The Traveling Wilburys in 1988. The songs on this album are very good. Hits include FREE FALLIN',I WON'T BACK DOWN,LOVE IS A LONG ROAD,FACE IN THE CROWD,RUNNIN' DOWN A DREAM and YER SO BAD. This was one of the best-selling albums of 1989. Some of the aforementioned hits debuted on the radio in early 1990(the album continued to sell well then). After track 5 on the CD and before track 6,is the following message spoken by Petty: ""HELLO CD LISTENERS! WE'VE COME TO THE POINT OF THIS ALBUM WHERE THOSE LISTENING TO THE LP OR CASSETTE WILL HAVE TO TURN OVER THE RECORD OR TAPE. IN FAIRNESS TO THOSE LISTENING TO THE CD,WE'LL TAKE A FEW SECONDS BEFORE BEGINNING SIDE 2. THANK YOU. HERE'S SIDE 2."" Obvioiusly Side 2 of the LP or cassette begins with FEEL A WHOLE LOT BETTER. That message is only heard when the CD is played in the normal mode. Great album,though!"
2,Maddeningly difficult to read!,Although the maps appear to be pretty thorough in their details I found this map booklet to be extremely frustrating to read. Everytime a road went off the page you'd have to locate the next section which invariably is like ten pages away. It was awful trying to check between one section and another!
5,nice devotional,"The reviewers before me did a nice job of covering the content of this nice little devotional book, so I won't do that again. However, I have enjoyed this book so much I wanted to add my comments and say that I find myself picking it up to read at all times of the day. With 2 very young children I have little time to read, but with the verses on one page and the inspirational story on the other, I find that I am able to complete the message at one time. I would highly recommend this book to any woman who wants to spend more time in God's word."
2,Where's the art?,My husband bought this for me new when it first came out. We were both disappointed; there are few illustrations. What I want to know is where can I get $300 for my barely touched copy and why on earth is this book worth so much?
1,Hate This Toy,"I cannot for the life of me get this toy to work. It winds up fine and when you let it go out of the water, works fine, but when we let it go in the water it doesn't work at all. Not only that but when my 4 month old grabs it and tries to stick it in her mouth, as soon as she gets it out of the water, it starts working and the alligator legs basically start beating her in the face...needless to say, I threw it out."
3,Radio reception issues,"I had a difficult time returning this item. It was easy to program radio stations into memory and at times the sound quality was good. The bass button was noticeable even with the stock headphones, which don't totally suck.However, I just found tuner interference to be too much. In a neighborhood where my car stereo doesn't have annoying blips and gaps, this unit didn't give me good clean reception.Both AM and FM reception had this problem at times.Sunspot activity? Maybe---we are having high activity now.Radio Shack's manager blamed the nuclear plant at Reed college....I doubt it---that would cause far more problems than radio reception.He also said that no other units would be any better....we shall see....I didn't try the CD player...I presume it would be fine."
3,"Okay of a Book, But I've Read Better","I'm an ocean liner buff, and pretty much a historian in my own way, and I have a large collection of Ocean Liner books, including this one. All I can say about it, is that it is fine, it's just a run of the mill book, with no real peaks or flaws. The one part I like about the book is the large pictures. I'm also an artist who focuses on ships and landscapes, and I have done pastel and charcol works of many of the ships in the book. I can notice many flaws though, nothing serious, but they're there. I think this may have to do with the fact that this book is from a whole collection of transportation books (The Golden Age of Steam, and The Golden Age of Aviation) and so the author was most likely not an ocean liner historian. I do think, though, this is a good book to use to get younger children interested in ocean liners, with large pictures, and fairly easy to read linear notes, a good book for our future Liner Historians!"
1,very little information,"This book was a major dissapointment. It does offer common sense suggestions. For example, if you would like to find bike paths, go to the chamber of commerce, where they might have maps or information. Or, if you are looking for riding partners, check your local bike shop. However, it is thin on concrete information. Although I'm new to touring, I learned very little. Ithen read RA Lovett's, ""The Essential Touring Cyclist,"" which is INFINITELY better than this book."
5,Veery informative without getting boring!,"I really enjoy this DVD. I watched a sea kayaking one on Amazon unlimited videos--and it was sooo boring. Also the music in it was just annoying--changing from banjo to flute to opra--weird. Anyway I was afraid this too would be corny--but it was not! So, if you got turned off by the other one, I recommend this one. It gives you different paddling techniques, it is pleasant, the sound is good, and it is overall a 5 star DVD. I keep referring back to it as I am new at kayaking."
2,mods required to fit,"i have 05 mtx and the aem does fit if you take care of 2 things1. you need to have about 1/4"" of washers/spacers since the support of the tubing mounts where the clutch cable support goes. it's no problem if you have atx (no clutch). but if you have mtx you'd end up with a 1/4"" gap and the support may potentially come loose if you don't add some spacers there2. the intake tube is about 0.2"" smaller than the stock intake hose where the two connect. I had to wrap some duck tape around the metal tube in order to fit the two togetherI used the intake for about a day and returned it for a refund because I feel no power gain from my stock airbox with airbox mod/resonator delete. also I don't feel safe wit the ducktape running around the metal tube."
3,"Feels durable, long enough, but there is static you will have to deal with.....","Feel durable, but I've heard on and off static. But I guess it was a good purchase for only $4"
5,More Than a Runner,A good read for anyone Sanders had done well with this book. He has seen to it that all ages are welcome.
5,Great Product,"The product works great! There is no audio problems to speak of. It is exactly as described, came on time, and I have used it multiple times without incident."
4,Good Product,"Not much to say about this product other then I does the job, and is made very well. I would recommend for your basic 3.5mm M2M needs for a low price."
1,very poorly shielded,"I used this cable to connect my Lenovo to the Samsung HDTV. It catches a lot of external noise. I can not use it, looking for a shielded one. Will appreciate any advise."
1,Defective Product,This product was defective from the first time I used it. Horrible booming feedback noise is prevalent during usage. Tried on different sounds systems to see if it was on my end...this did not solve the problem.
5,Does the job.,"This aux cable seems to work well. Haven't had any problems with it, so it gets a 5 star from me!"
2,meh...,"This cable seemed to like a half decent cable at first, but should have listen to my gut feeling when I found something at this price.The sound that I got out through this was kinda sratched up and not a great experience.I used this at a couple different spots, in the pickup, in the tractor and some other place. The sound were ok for the tractor at certain times because the whitenoise whatever scratched up deal was kinda faded away compared to the tractors roar, but at time and with certain music/tracks it were still a problem and in the quieter pickup it wasnt pleasant."
2,The poor quality,When I first bought it I did not like the sound quality when I plug it in my car.After a while I started to use Bluetooth instead of this one.. the bass was better .. the level of volume was higher
2,Not a good connection,"After 2 uses, this product started making the audio buzz and it won't go away. It does not have a good connection."
3,LAST CALL FOR ANTHONY PERKINS,"Made in Germany and England in 1991 this was the great Anthony Perkins' last cinema role (his last film role was in the 1992 TV movie ""In the Deep Woods""). Here again he plays another demented paranoid Norman Bates type killer who goes off the deep end once again when his beloved mannequin is taken away from him. It dosen't help when it was his namesake, downstairs in tha apartment block that was responsible for this.Anthony Perkins deserved better than this, but as usual his presence makes the movie worth while."
3,Skimmed the pages,"I've only skimmed the table of contents and flipped thru the book, but it seems to offer just what it advertised: wisdom and know-how for the survivalist. It's not rocket science, but there are ideas in there that will be helpful in any crisis management planning."
5,Good handbook!,"This book has great info in it. I have told several people about this book, and told them they should own this."
3,"Informative, but not quite what i wanted","While this book was a good read and very informative it wasn't quite what I was looking for.Most of the book involves preparing food for at least a year and going over things such as preserving, storing food, and planning meals. While I was looking for information like this the book seems more for the hardcore prepper rather than someone looking to get together a month or two of supplies and being ready to survive for a while during a disaster. I think I'm going to try reading Arthur Bradley's book next as it seems to be what I was originally looking for.Handbook to Practical Disaster Preparedness for the Family, 2nd EditionThis is the book I plan on reading next"
2,Poor Editing.,"I am no grammar Nazi, but this book constantly confuses ""looses"" with ""loses"". For example page 55 states: ""...air dried tends to loose nutrients more slowly..."". This editing error is constant, and happens often in the book. It makes me question all the other information in the book. If something so common (top 10 internet misspelling) can slip in, what other mistakes abound? I could forgive one instance, but this one is repeated at least 10 times."
5,Balanced Approach,"For all those reading several of these 'Survival Books'. This one seems to have the most balanced approach to keeping you, your family, and others around you (which after an experience like that I'm sure those that went though it around you will be a part of your family for the rest of your life)ALIVE!!!"
2,a waste of time,This book is a waste of time. It could be half the current size and give more information. The fact it is large mearly means that the writer is the type of person who like to hear himself talk. There are many books half it size that give more and better informatiopn.
4,"Too early to tell, but it looks good.","I just received this book recently in the mail from the US, and have not had any need to use it. Without actually testing it out, I can only say that it looks good and has a lot of useful pictures. The price was reasonable, so I can't see why anyone would not want to add it to their repairbook collection."
5,Just as expected,"Purchased this multimeter specifically for its additional environmental sensing capabilities. The unit works fine. The instructions are in very poor English, but comprehensible. The leads can be attached to the unit in a such a way as to form a poor contact between the lead and the unit, pushing the leads in all the way is important - but not clearly obvious or specified."
3,Disappointing and a Little Confusing...,"Overall, I found this book somewhat difficult to use. My focus on my first visit to New Orleans was the French Quarter and I found the maps to be very lacking. The cross streets were not listed on part of the map, so we actually had to locate another map at the hotel to take with us. We visited several of the places not recommended in the book (like the flea market in the French Quarter), and if you are looking for typical ""tourist"" type items, then this is by far the cheapest and best place to shop! I would definitely recommend purhasing another book in addition to this one to get someone elses perspective on the French Quarter."
3,Little Snow White NOT for LIttle Girls,"Our 3 year old LOVED this doll...until her arm fell off and couldn't be repaired. This is the second one we've purchased...so far, so good! The clothes are not well made...they are a satin-like material that frays easily. The doll and her accessories are very pretty. Her arms and legs are difficult to bend. My daughter still loves her, despite all of this!"
5,essence of truth,"After reading this story I was in a trance. I literally could not put it down. It was unreal how I felt every emotion. I want to thank Kenny for sharing this very personal journey with the world. It's a extraordinary, wonderfully written book about coping with grief and finding purpose and direction in our life's regardless of our circumstances. Five stars!"
1,"Clumsy Style, no water resistance","My first time to purchase this watch. It looked good on the picture, but when I got it, it looked so huge, too thick,... and ""ugly""....:( ... I cannot believe this watch does not design for resisting water.... dumb!!!Good luck! if you really want to buy it.HL"
1,worest quality,"The book was listed as 'very good', but when I received it, it was broken. As it is for me, so I just keep it. Can't trust the quality any more."
1,No good,"After reading the review on this release, I eagerly buyed this long desired film. What a dissapointment! I don't care how good is the transfer if the source employed is such a trashy, low quality print."
5,A VERY INTERESTING AND VERY INFORMATIVE BOOK.,"I find ANNE FRANK REMEMBERED by Miep Gies and Alison Leslie Gold very interesting and very informative. It was written by the woman who knew first-hand what happened behind the bookcase. Miep Gies was one of the lifeline that saved Anne, her family, and friends for as long as it did. Their memories must never be forgotten. I highly recommend this book to anybody interestested in Anne Frank or the Holocaust."
3,Very readable,"Miep Gies was a young newleywed from Vienna when her boss Otto Frank approached her about assisting him in hiding his family in the rooms above her office. The story she tells, at the age of 78, recalls the hows, whys, and wheres of what went on outside the Annex where young Anne Frank and her family hid for two years. Very readable."
2,mediocre with major flaw,"I got this unit because the picture looked nice and everything seems to work nicely. It has massage and normal shower mode. The side hose for grab and shower is excellent when you don't want water coming down on you.When I got the unit and setted it up, everything changed. The build quality is rather mediocre. It is hard to switch from normal to massage. The accessory hose does not stay in its slot and keeps falling down. It hit my head a few times while shampooing. Absolute piece of crap!Don't get it. Buy something better"
4,Fairly Good Bargain for the Price,"I found this to be a fairly good bargain. Water pressure does not seem to drop when both shower heads are being used. The only problem I experienced was that, in installing the diverter, no matter how much I tightened the nut, the diverter wanted to spin freely, even tho' I had installed the vinyl washer properly. Ended up going out and purchasing a rubber washer, put it in and the diverter is nice and tight. No problems since."
3,My first HDTV,It was replaced. The relacement one is good. But last weekend I inserted a picutre USB flash memory into the USB port. After I reviewed all pictures. I can't pull out my memory.
5,Great Buy!,This TV was everything I could have hoped for. The picture is so crisp and clear. The colors are very vivid and very bright. The viewing angles are not at problem at all. I have an Xbox 360 hooked up to it and it displays the graphics beautifully. For the price this TV is a bargain compared to others. The TV is lighter then my parents 42 inch plasma and it is not that bulky in the back. I highly recommend this TV to anyone looking for quality HDTV at a cheaper price!!
5,"Samsung HL-S5087W 50"" 1080p DLP HDTV GREAT!","I bought this item as a Christmas gift for the house: it's been a wonderful investment. The picture is beautiful and can be controlled to mesh with the type of program you're watching: movies, TV, games, pictures (from computer), etc. The on-screen menus are very easy to navigate. The remote is comfortable and easy to use. Set-up was a snap to integrate with DirecTV. The view from dead ahead is gorgeous. The view from either side is better than my old, traditional TV. Highly recommend this!"
3,"three and a half stars, amazon. THREE AND A HALF","cd compilation of two previous lps of galt macdermot's more minor releases (he composed Hair, apparently), which while it may not be a long lost classic unearthed is worth hearing. my only real qualm with this is in between some pretty nice tracks like ripped open by metal explosions and lost dreams, you get utterly bizarre inclusions like a radio ad for skin balm(?) and some real monkey-organ-grinder sounding stuff. a little programming here and there though, and you've got yourself a significantly shorter but pretty funky little disc."
3,awesome,the single player is half-arsed garbage. go for jedi knight: jedi outcast if you want a good story...it's all about the online community and the mods in this game.
1,Used to love it,This had been my favorite gum for the past few years but lately the packs I've bought have been dissapointing. The gum has become rubbery and loses it's flavor much quicker than in the past. I've since switched to the Strawberry and Berry flavors and like them much better. These flavors are really good and stay soft.
4,Good product - cheap remote - great service,See the above- good piece of equipment from performance standpoint and iscost effective. The remote is cheap and can break down. Amazon was outstanding from a supplier standpoint.
1,Never received item,"Item never shipped. No notification from vendor regarding status, but did receive all supporting items (ie stylus, antiseptic cream). Thought would eventually receive electrolysis but never did and got busy so did not follow up. Will never place an order for health and beauty items again."
1,Totally impractical!,"To anyone who can insert a wire smaller in diameter than a human hair, in a hair follicle, at the correct angle, kudos! To the rest of us, this thing's totally worthless."
2,Recieve my item on time but its not working,"I recieve my item, and I was so happy but.......its not working, I call the hotline number because you do have a 1 year warranty, comes to find out the electrolysis doesnt have any current, so I have to ship it back to them, in return a new one that'll be working."
1,"lose money, not hair","Weird. This thing is weird. It's not at all what I was expecting. My mother had an electrolysis kit in the 1970's that consisted of a pair of electric tweezers, and it would give you a little shock, but it worked! This thing is whimpy at best. Don't expect to do a lot of work with it. It's time consuming and just plain weird."
4,Great book for teachers!,"This book is very teacher-friendly. If you are looking to implement differentiated instruction into your classroom routine, this book provides many excellent strategies for your use. I plan to utilize several of them in the upcoming school year."
4,I read this book with my 10-year old daughter,"My 10-year old daughter and I read this mystery so we could discuss it together. We liked it so much that we both continued on and read all ten of the books in the 'Adventures in the Northwoods' series. The author puts a little cliff-hanger at the end of every chapter to capture the attention of the young reader. We had the opportunity to hear the author speak in March, and really found it interesting."
1,Shame On You Michael Gross,"If Michael Gross dedicated just a fraction of the time he spent researching and writing this book, perhaps he would have a fraction of what Mr. Lauren has: a highly successful and valuable global company, a stimulating and fulfilling workplace for thousands of people, a high quality assortment of products, and world class brand. Mr. Gross is a bottom feeder, a veritable catfish in the literary world. He creates nothing. He makes nothing. He does nothing. Other than criticize and critique what others do. He doesn't strike me as the type of person to be ashamed of himself, but I am ashamed for him."
3,Ugh,"This book is sooooo long. Yes he is weird, yes he is rich, yes he has led a life more fantasy based than Michael Jackson. It's big book that has some really good material if you can deal with the fasting between those events. It's fairly one sided, not Gross' fault, Lauren is just not a very faceted individual. Gross covered him very well, but Lauron is just dull beyond his clothing choices."
4,A little underground treasure,"Had Mr. Paglia lived in the Sixties or early 70s, been American and well 'connected' in the record industry, this record would have been a classic. There are fantastic funk grooves in it (check out the song ""Arturo's Birthday Party""!) and amazing Hammond playing all over the album... This record definitely deserves his rank alongside my favorite Jimmy Smith, Lonnie Smith or James Taylor Quartet funk albums!However, the album not only features funky Hammond grooves, but also bossa-nova, humorous italian 'lounge music' and McCartney-George Martin-style string arrangements, making it a very varied, even 'eclectic' LP. I am not particularly fond of the vocals in a few tracks of the album nor of some string parts, but it is only a minor drawback.I strongly recommend this barely-known album, especially if you like the Funk or want to impress your guests with a stylish 60s party!"
5,Manga Studio EX es lo mejor que he visto,"Magnifico programa, muy superior a todo lo que he visto, increiblemente bien adaptado para todo dibujante de manga, profesional o principiante. Facil de usar, con todo tipo de herramientas y recursos utiles 100%, y lo que mas me ha impresionado es su capacidad para incorporar y editar objetos en 3D no solo los que vienen en el programa sino nuevos objetos de propia elaboracion o de los disponibles en Internet en varios formatos; los recibe y edita sin problema en la misma pagina de trabajo. Manga Studio EX es sencillamente maravilloso. Lo recomiendo ampliamente."
4,...,"Very good book for the most part. Section 3 of the book is my favorite because this is where he gives the good tips to learning any new language. There's a nice chart that displays the important words you should learn in the beginning of a language in order to help jump start your ability to communicate. A couple of his stories do seem to be unnecessary, but they are usually a good illustration of a point that he is trying to prove. Would buy again."
3,e frontier Manga Studio Debut,This is my first try and computer aided graphics. The program is easy to use. I was able to create some awesome images the first day. I am a little disappointed that NO speech balloons are included with this version. What is a manga or comic book graphic art program without speech balloons? DAH! e frontier could have included a few speech balloons with the Debut version.
1,Misleading Ad,"This is a simple drawing program, much like Paint. Don't be mislead by the colored picture on the cover, it only does black and white. And it has no help in drawing Manga figures. And it is a stripped-down program, at that. The documentation is for the full program, so you can't do much of what you read in the manual and help files. Save your money, this program isn't worth buying."
4,Get a little close into Lee's workings,"The interviews here span a good period of time, so there is some repetition of material, but there is also some great insight into Lee's working process and work. It's a good gateway into some of his poems, and if you want to get to know one of poetry's modern masters, this is one way to go about doing it."
5,"pointing at the Emperor, unclothed...","This is a brilliant and useful selection of classic poetry and prose that owes nothing to tokenism - which can be a shock to some readers these days. All this fuss over the title neatly ignores the ironic engine it engages - the kind of people that react by thinking it is pompous and will only be liked by 'yuppies' are the very kind of people that are concerned with being seen as pompous and yuppy-ish. Bloom may be sometimes heavy-handed in his critique of modern life, but he can also be subtle.If Bloom has any role to play in 'The Emperor's New Clothes' it is as the child pointing at the nakedness he sees all around him."
2,Not the original artists?,"I bought this disc (from another retailer) and it was not what I expected. These certainly aren't the versions that were made famous. In particular, I wanted the Club Med ""Hands Up!"" song, or something close. The version on this disc sounds more like ""Easy Listening"" than dance music. Probably great for a more subdued party atmosphere... or in case you own a chain of elevators."
3,"How accurate is an ""unauthorized"" biography?","The professional information is most likely accurate. A listingof movies and television roles for Dean Stockwell could be foundin a number of places, and then used in this book. You cannot,however, really vouch for all other information if the authornever even had the chance to interview the actor and find out ifstories and anecdotes are true. I didn't get the impression thatanything was over-played, but I still wondered if we had the wholestory. Being something of a Dean Stockwell fan, I would ratherlike to know that he was really well-represented by a book suchas this. (I do have to say, though, that the author of thisbook never made me feel that she was trying to sensationalizeany part of the story.)"
5,Hysterically funny!,"Unlike the movie of the same name, this book is the funniest page-turner that I've purchased in a long time. The story takes place in the English countryside where a widow finds herself penniless but with a huge pile of bills left by her husband. She is about to loose her house when she comes up with a plan along with her gardener, to grow pot in her greenhouse. She has a 'greenthumb' and therefore has no problem cultivating the 'stuff.' The book is about all the ups and downs as she grows it, tries to keep it hidden, tries to sell it and many other very funny events. The book has a 'twister' ending which would be a spoiler if I told you so I won't. I fully recommend this very comical account of a granny with money problems and the delightful town she lives in with all of it's very amusing characters."
5,Great entertaining recipes,"Even though it is older, this cookbook has great, easy recipes for elegant entertaining. It would be perfect for the holidays! There are many recipes that are unique and I've not seen in other collections."
3,Light Entertainment,"Not being a big Western reader (other than some Zane Grey books-on-tape), I picked this up at the library based on the cover. It was a quick, entertaining read - it just seemed a little sparse."
3,good movie but bad dvd on secant dice,the dvd had a bad audio on 2 dvd. i sent it back and still wanting fore a new one it being at lest 14 or 18 days
3,Movie,"Very well done, interesting movie...the actress playing Mrs. Kennedy could have been better, but it was a good movie overall"
4,Kennedy review,"I really liked this CD. I wish they said something about all the family members. Teddy and his sister, I think she was known as Kic were not mentioned. On the whole this was a very good look into the private lives of the Kennedy's."
3,"Accomplishes his goal, but tangential","Bauckham accomplished, in my opinion, his goal of demonstrating that the canonical Gospels contain eyewitness testimony and that the Gospels themselves indicate this in the same ways as Roman biographies of that period. I felt that he spent far too much time and energy though, presenting his theory as to the identity of the Gospel of John's ""beloved disciple"" - a point he admitted, early on, really had no bearing on recognizing eyewitness material in the NT. Also seemed to be a great deal of repitition of throughout the book. Bauckham makes some truly excellent points in this work, but he could have delivered them in a slimmer volume."
3,Doubtful,"This is a wishful intent, aimed to prove a certain hypothesis.The hypothesis is controversial at best.Undoubtedly there were thousands of eyewitnesses to the life of Jesus, but no texts, if any, of their writings survived, unless one is to accept the fragments of the so-called Gospel of Mary Magdalen as being one such. The latter are more Buddhist in nature.One wonders, also, why Jesus did not write his own gospel. Possibly he wrote down some of his teachings, but they have not been found.The book is a noble academic treatise. However I think it is clear that the Gospels were written many decades indeed life-spans after Jesus...with all that this time lag must imply."
3,Not for water,Do not get this collar if your dog will be going into water. My dog was constantly losing the clip-on lights that I put on her collar so I thought this would be great. The first day I used it she went into the water on our morning jog and it immediately went out. Hopefully it will dry out and work again. Othwerwise it is a good collar. Nice and bright and much easier to work with than the clip-on lights.
2,"Lot of expectations, few results","I bought this book with truly great expectations of finally unveiling at list part of the misteries that surround W.D. Gann work.The study of the book unfortunately did not prove to be so satisfying, as I would have expected.In my opinion, the material could have been much better structured, since, while reading the book, I hardly found a ""fil rouge"", a logic sequence among the various topics discussed. This jeopardizes the value you can get from the book. For sure Bill is a Gann expert, but the way he transfers his knowledge is questionable.The book indeed comes with a generous set of charts that are instead really well done and in my opinion somewhat more useful than the book itself.Buy for your bookshelf, but do not expect that much from the book."
5,Surround Sound,I us this devise at lease 3 times a week simply to clean up old tapes and lps tranferted to mp3
4,"GREAT Sound, Turns TV audio beyond its limits","Overall I love this product. I have one for me, and I gave one to my dad. My dad enjoys his stuff loud so this took care of some of the clarity issues he has on his older CRT TV. I do enjoy the bass boost as well as the overall sound quality coming from my stock TV. I always have this technology on. For $30 its a great product and a must for any stereo system. i've put it on a stereo setup and it goes way beyond ""equalizer"" boosting or standard amplifier. It does have a subtle surround sound effect, but nothing to the feeling of a true 5.1 setup. You can jimmy it on to a 5.1 setup and it enhances it better as well. I really enjoy this technology and would recommend it to any audiophile just looking to get more from his/her sound experience."
3,"Not bad, but...","I bought 100 of these batteries a year ago. They have been fine for radios, remote controls and other undemanding gadgets. I don't know if it's the humidity or the nature of the batteries, but some have now started to leak. I've thrown away about 20 and have the same number left.If these batteries suit your purposes, I would suggest buying a smaller pack and using them quickly, rather than hoarding a large number as I did."
5,Excellent value,"This bulk purchase provides value as well as performance equivalent to name brand batteries in digital cameras, toys, MP3's, and other heavy-duty uses."
1,Too old,"If your looking for information on a upcoming trip look at the date this book was writen 1994, I sent it back. The information is outdated."
5,Perfect condition fast delivery,"I ordered a book in ""good condition"" and received what appeared to be a perfectly new book! Fast Delivery, great service!"
4,The Defintive Book For Widows Forms.NET,"This is definitively the best book I have read on Windows.Forms.NET programming. I have read other books such as the one by Petzold and those published by Wrox. But by far if you work through ALL the chapters, you will be able to walk away with a wealth of knowledge on Windows Forms.The approach is very unique and I have not seen it in any other book so far. I do not distinguish books by publisher rather by the quality of contents of the book and this book I have to admit is well thought, cut and presented.I bought the e-version of the book."
5,Best Windows Forms Book I've Read,"This is by far the clearest and best way to get up to speed writing Windows Form applications. I especially like the format of the ""Action/Result"" tables. It clearly shows the sequence of steps required to accomplish the current task described in the book. I also like the eBook format so I can have it on the screen as I experiment with my own development.Both beginner programmers and former C++ Win32 developers will welcome this approach to entering the world of .NET and C#."
3,Good but omits multithreading....,"No detailed coverage of the Progress Bar control. Reason: so that multithreading and concurrency could be avoided. It is a common GUI programming task to allow a user to cancel a long running operation while keeping the GUI updated and responsive. However, this requires spawning off a separate thread to handle the long-running operation. That thread must also be able to communicate with the main GUI thread. This must be performed carefully but it is easily done by experienced GUI programmers. You won't get coverage of that with this book. Good luck....BT"
3,"Good concept, but not long enough, or wide enough to really work well.","Its great in concept, and with a few minor changes (making it about 3-4"" longer,.6"" wider, and giving it a much more powerful vibrator motor) could be a really fun toy. It works best with a harness or jean shorts that you can lock it in place with, but you will likely find it lacking for all of the reasons above. On the bright side, this isn't porous, and its very easy to clean."
4,yup,After reading all the reviews I thought it would be bigger than it was the vibe is powerful but doesn't seem to give the wearer as much vibratiion as the reciever other than that it's a great product and I believe every couple should have a feeldoe... i'd also suggest getting a harness of some sort to help hold it in for women who haven't quite devoloped their pc muscles or for vigorous sessions... It can fall out.
5,Great for a little spice,"This toy is great. While it is meant for play without a harness, I bought it to use with my Spare Parts harness (which I absolutely love) and it works great."
4,It is worth the money spent,Ok so i have a 98 tahoe that was misfireing and had a bad idle. So i bought this part and it worked great it was worth the money i paid for it. It was a lot of word to get the old one out and the new one in but not to bad. I would tell anyone who is haveing that problem with there truck to get this part.
1,this makes me furious,"murder by death, you're cool. the guys who did cherub rock is decent... and the chorus to 1979 was close to decent.. the rest? oh man.. such a horrible tribute to such a brilliant band.when is there going to be a good thank you to them? because they deserve it."
2,Dry statistics aren't the way to evoke compassion,"While this is a useful tool to use to reject conservative ideas that everyone has an equal shot, dry statistics don't bring about compassion. And what is needed in this issue is just that."
4,great reference,"As a Phd student in biology, this book offers great reference for bioinformatics in a clear and smooth manner. it explains briefly the concept behind few notions and then shows you how to search, interpret the data you receive. no previous knowledge of bioinformatics is necessary to have this book. the only problem is that several websites either change/close their website or change the application format and it becomes hard to follow the book instructions. however it is a very important tool for researchers."
4,A Lesson in Perspective Taking,"To be quite honest, when I began reading Robert Guthrie's Even the Rat was White I was undoubtedly disinterested, as it discusses scientific measurements and experimental research. But I continued on and soon came to realize I too was becoming the same white, ""prototypical"" psychologist the entire book critiques. From beginning to end, Guthrie challenged his readers to see from a black, white, red, and yellow-skinned perspective, as well as revealed the unfortunate neglect of perspective taking by the ""prototypical"" psychologists of our time. By examining archival documents, most of which are not found in a mainstream classroom, Even the Rat was White uncovers the trials and tribulations faced by early African-American psychologists, as well as their scientific contributions and lifetime achievements in the field. In reading this book you, too, will have a better understanding on the historical roots of psychology; not just from a BLACK or WHITE perspective!"
4,Our Lhasa Apso named Duie,"Enjoyed the book, as our dog is new to us and we wanted to learn a little more about his background. The book was interesting in explaining the history of the breed. We were disappointed as we didn't see but one picture that actually looked like our dog. I guess he has a 'puppy cut' so those pictures were more familiar to us."
1,broke very soon,We hoped this would work for out 15 lb puppy to walk at night. It pulled apart even with a smaller dog within a few weeks. Totally broke and unusable within a month. Don't waste your money as we did!
3,Got what I expected,"These speakers are decent. They are about what I expected for the money. they were a little thicker than I expected, but I still was able to get them to work. If you just want a decent set of speakers, then you cant beat these for the money."
4,Good Product,Good ProductIt does its job. It keeps me healthy. No problems or side affects. I like it.Thank you
5,Some odd flip sides,"The live cuts here are worth the listen. If you can't download them on the web, you may want to buy a copy of this."
1,i woulda given it zero stars but thats not possible,"no offense to this write but our teacher forced us to read this book... honestly i think most books suck. ive never read one i liked except maybe 2 or 3. i dont care if my teacher sees this because this is my opinion and she cant do a thing about it if she wanted to.. but i hated this book. who wants to read over the summer unless its a text message or letter, etc. from your friends. id rather spend my time with friends than read a book over the summer... especially this one."
4,It was very realistic,I really enjoyed reading this book. I was interested in it from the begining to the end. I didn't think that any of the parts were to boring. It was kind of scary to really think that something like that could really happen. It was about a boy who just got a gun for his birthday and went out to shoot trees and shot a man.
1,"Perhaps a well written book, but I was disappointed in it.","In fact, my reaction to the main character of Sister Maura was a constant, ""If this is how she feels and acts, no wonder she does not want to stay at the end."" She spent the entire time in the convent hating everything and almost everyone, and trying to change it all to fit what she wanted. And if it didn't fit what she wanted, it was - of course - all wrong and better be changed! Talk about a self-centered and unyielding young woman! I was not impressed."
3,Dorman 610-416 M12-1.5 Serrated Bolt,"had to grind it down a little to get it to snug into the hole, other than that it worked fine"
2,Don't waste your money,"If you want to pass your exams get the Dearborn series, I failed my 63 using this book and barely passed my 6. The real test closely mirrors dearborn material. If you can pass the practice exams on dearborn then you will pass the real thing. Dearborn forces you to understand the concepts not just definitions...... This book was a waste......"
3,Falls short of expectations,Sections are quick and easy if that's your thing but the review questions at the end of the sections are nothing like the ones on the test so do not fall in love with your scores. It is best used in conjunction with a more comprehensive study guide.
2,Alright,I read the whole section on the series 6 part and completed all the tests. I was feeling good about taking the test because I was completing the tests on the book with ease. After taking my Series 6 I saw that the book did not cover alot of the things the test had.. I was really Disappointed now I have to go buy A Kaplan Book if anyone wants to buy my books email me.
4,"It's still worth it, even if a couple of them are ""medium""..","I'm learning new things from my 3-year-old. Anything that fits between two opposites is ""medium"". A couple of the songs here are not great, but they are by no means bad. According to my daughter, that would make them ""medium"". Ha! But this is still a great CD. The style is more representative of the time it was recorded, but the thoughts put into the lyrics still smack of our old familiar friend, and that's what counts to me. Very much recommended."
4,The last four star studio LP of Buffett's lengthy career and a very good one too!,"All the songs on here are very good to great.This was also the Buffett release to be issuedon vinyl, too. Gravity Storm is my favortite here.Next best release after this was: ""Boats, Beaches,Bars, Ballads"", a great twenty year retrospective."
2,Nice photos; generic information,"The pictures are gorgeous - makes a great coffee table book. However, the info is pretty generic and a bit fluffy considering Barton's years of experience as a Swissy breeder. Looks like the editor was given too much free range on this one, and cut out everything that might have been interesting or useful."
1,worthless piece of junk!,I wanted this tv so bad because of it's convenience and style that I purchased it and returned it 3 times to get a working one. Every one of them stopped functioning correctly after 8-10 days. The picture went fuzzy and only the sound could be heard. I went and upgraded to the same tv but the eddie bauer edition found at target for 50$ more and have had it over three months now with no problems. Don't waste your money on this worthless piece of junk!!!
3,"If you hear breathing in your house, GET OUT!!!","This book is about a spirit of a Indian medicine man who wants to get back at the white people for killing his kind. Great book to read for being his 3rd book, but the ending was one you can live without. I loved the plot and the gore and suspense. I recommend this book to all MASTERTON lovers!!"
3,"A little much, both price-wise and opinion-wise","A valuable addition to any horror fan's library. Outside of the classics, it does throw in a lot of films that I would question being included in this book. However, the authors would've done well to tone down their opinions a tad -- for pete's sake, many of these films are meant to fill out the bottom of a double-feature bill, which doesn't make them candidates for over-the-top critical analysis. One has to take these films for what they are and leave it at that."
4,Wide variety,"Best Loved Afghans contains a wide variety of patterns including a few for baby, a couple seasonal styles, and a range from very casual to some more formal styles. There are some I can't wait to make and others I don't care for at all. The color photographs are quite helpful in project selection, although some of the colors appear to be a little off."
2,Strictly for the Beginner,The contents of the book whets your appetite for some useful information. The reality falls far short of your expectations however. The technical analysis section presents nothing you should not already know and is very weak. Many of the examples are of very radical events in historical perspective. If you are looking for real strategy and technical analysis keep searching. If you wish to learn the fundamentals this may be useful. The charts present the profit/loss potential involved in trading.
5,Excellent gift,This was a gift for my daughter who lives in France. She enjoyed Season One so much that I have decided this is a yearly gift - as long as there is a season.
4,Darker days on Wisteria Lane,"Desperate Housewives Series 1 became a hit because of it's fun off-the-wall characters, wild unpredictability, glamorous leading ladies and brilliant writing. Series 2 delivers all the strengths of Series 1 but, in all told, a somewhat darker turn. Will the series get darker or lighter in Series 3? Only time will tell.The DVD pack for Series 2 however delivers dependable predictable quality. Fine video and audio transfer. A good selection of extras that just aren't idle fillers and, with images of each of the female stars on each disk volume, a handsome package."
3,Desperate Housewives 2nd season,"I bought this for a friend of mine along with the housewives 1st season. She watched the first season, didn't watch the 2nd season yet, but I watched it on tv. Not as good as season 1, it was lacking. So far, season 3 seem to be a big hit, they went back to the 1st season style"
4,Great shoe trees,"These shoe trees are great. They have a nice weight to them, smell good, and work really well. The only down side to my purchase is that I found them for a cheaper price while I was browsing at a local store shortly after receiving and using them."
4,Seems nice,So for the price these seem like a nice item to keep your shoes in good condition. The guy at the ferragamo store suggested using them. The sizing chart was difficult to understand but I wear a size 7 dress shoe (8 in a nike) and the Small ones seem to fit my shoes.
3,Shoe tree seems OK,"First impression out of the package - a really awful smell. Maybe that's the cedar part, I don't know. At any rate, it does what it's supposed to - maintain the shape of the shoe, though the springs seem fairly weak. I'll try and say more about it after some time goes by.I've had it a while yet; now I can say that the straps are too small and too scrawny, and hard to use to remove or insert the shoe trees. I'd greatly prefer a real handle."
5,Woodlore Adjustable Shoe tree,I think this are the best shoe tree i have ever owned. They smell nice too!! I would recommend this product to anyone.
5,Perfect,Fit shoes well and keeps them deodorized! Looks great in my new cole haans. Keeps the form well. Highly recommend.
1,A bit of an ego!,"Bought it as a present, and decided to read it first to get an idea of what Baby Phat brand is like. After reading the first chapter, it made me want to throw it out the window! This lady is very full of herself, and it's a bad read! DON'T BUY IT!!!"
1,Fashionistas Only,"This book really isn't for everyone. I feel that most of the advice she gave was not univeral but was very specific to the fashion and modeling industry. I felt that if I did have the things she recommeded at my job I would be fired.The only thing that might be univeral is what she says about debt, but she doesn't really give a detailed plan to get out of it."
5,perfect for small spaces,"not too much and not too little thump. i installed in my infiniti, ford f150 and now my mini cooper."
3,Simple to install & Compact,"Pros:1) Fairly simple to install (includes all mounting hardware2) Compact3) Innovative Design: The passive radiator effectively double the surface area of the diaphram.Cons:The unit seems to have a life-span of approximately 3 years. I think the built-in amp goes ka-put.Conclusion:If you have the room, a sub+enclosure+amp isn't that much pricier, larger, or more complicated to install."
1,Very little bass,This is a servo driven sub so don't expect much of any bass. I was very disappointed in what little bass there was. The infinite baffle was rattling and crackling even at low volume.
3,Not the bass i was hoping for @$200,"The speaker sounds nice at low volume,however can't handle a decent amount of volume. Kinda disappointed for the price of the unit."
5,Infinity Basslink sub system,"This is a very nice addition to a small car system. I have an infinity component tweeter/mid system in my 2008 jetta. Total of 4 tweeters, 4 mids and 2 biaxials powered by a nice size amp. needed to fill the low end but my days of a pointlessly 'booming' system are over. Needed just enough to fill in the gap left by the component speakers. Based on prior reviews, seemed like this is just what I needed. and it is. It has enough punch to make the entire car sound GREAT! It won't shake your windows and you won't hear it coming down the street but if you want a low end add on for your car and you're after sound quality, not volume, then this is it. I would definitely buy this again. Actually thinking about getting another for my Tacoma. I currently have a Kicker solo baric in it now from back when I was after max bass but it's a bit bulky. This would still give me all the bass I need and free up some space."
5,Nice sub for a little added punch,"Not sure about others but i will be installing this unit (yes the same one) into my 3rd vehicle since I purchased it over 5 years ago.I replaced my Pioneer system driving which was driving 2 ported Advent sub boxes with this unit after the Pioneer/Advent system was stolen.The Advents had 2 4"" subs per box so I was only filling in the lower end bass with them.This seemed the perfect solution since it was going into the hatchback of an Chevy Aveo where space was at a premium. Once 'tuned' this system provides enough bass in the right location to make mirrors vibrate, your just not going to wake the neighbors 3 blocks away and that is just fine for me.If you overdrive it I would expect you will kill it prematurely. I love the remote function which i set at midpoint and find I have decent control over the bass from track to track.Maybe I got lucky with mine but for me it has been a 5 star solution."
5,Good sound for such a small box,"I've bought so much on Amazon, I thought it's finally time I leave some feedback. I have an infiniti SUV with the bose sound system and it's safe to say that the subwoofer it comes with is absolute garbage - hence, my purchase of the basslink. I must say that this thing absolutely booms. For the size that it actually is, this thing can pump out some sound. The lone problem I have with it is that it doesn't hit low bass as good as a true subwoofer enclosure. I've tried it on multiple songs and it doesn't sound bad, it just doesn't sound as good as a true enclosure. That being said, this woofer still does hit and is a great, less expensive and smaller space taking solution - just beware that it takes a while to 'tune' due to the knobs you have to tweak to get the sound to your liking."
2,La felicidad dura poco,"Este juguete da un bajo profundo, poderoso y definido... mientras funciona. A los 6 meses de uso se me daño. Me costo 75 usd repararlo, espero que funcione mas tiempo"
3,Basslink - Second Unit,"Well, my first Basslink lasted 3 years. So why did I get another? Simple, it's such a simple installation and provides just the right amount of performance in my truck (and extended cab with the unit under the seat). I'll like get the original fixed and keep it as spare since these units are not noted for their reliability.Given the above, if you want good sound, and easy install, and are limited on space, this is a good unit, not great (reliability), but good."
2,Good if you know nothing about the ACT,I found this book a little elementary. I thought it would be good for someone that was clueless about the ACT but if you've taken it once or twice and need study help. Choose something else.
5,Drilled through concrete as if it was butter!,"Ordered these drill bits, along with a Porter-Cable hammer-drill for a basement entrance renovation. The two together worked great. Remember to drill a deeper than the screws you are using, reverse the drill (or use shop vac) to get out the loose particles and be sure that you have the right length concrete screws (I broke a few off before realizing they are only designed to thread about an inch and a half of concrete, even on a 4"" concrete screw)."
3,some confusion,"Pretty good, but there are some concepts that are not explained in a very clear way. Particularly, wind shifts. There are various explanations of playing the shifts throughout the book, based on the idea of predictiing shifts and acting accordingly, but they are often rather mysterious. Also, some ideas are outdated due to rules changes. A new, improved edition would be great."
3,A story with three moral lessons,"1.) You can't judge a book by it's cover2.) You always know who your true friends are3.) Be yourselfLibrarian Scarlett Jane Stien learns these lessons the hard way when her 'friend' Pam talks into changing her look to see if she could catch a man for her personality instead of her looks. Scarlett goes full throttle, not just changing her looks, but her job, her place to live, and even her name.This was an okay book, not the best I've read. Pam got on my nerves way too much and Scarlett was too much of a pushover when it came to Pam in this situation."
4,Just what we needed,"I bought 4 of these towel dispensers for our new church restroom. We had been just putting the folding towels on the counter, but it was so wasteful that we bit the bullet and bought the dispensers. They were a bit better quality than I expected, and 2 keys come with each dispenser!No regrets with this product."
3,Same old Paul....,"Maybe I was hoping for something different from Paul. The only thing that I found different from KISS on this album was the sampling and the way the guitar sounded. It's a good rock album nevertheless but basically, the themes are always the same. I've always found that Paul writes great love songs but to mix 10 songs (read: ONLY!!!!) around the same pattern, it's a little bittoo much for my taste."
2,Sounds like B sides to KISS' Hot In the Shade,"Being a KISS fan for the last 30 years, I was looking forward to this release (although I'm no longer a die-hard). I had not heard any of the album's leaked songs prior to 10/24. I must say I was disappointed. Yes, it's ""poppy"", but what would you expect from Paul? The thing that struck me is that it sounded out-dated. Many songs were TOO reminiscent of that early 90s KISS sound or worse yet, Paul's 1978 solo album. That said, it did seem to have more cohesiveness than Gene's recent solo album...YUCK...but I'm glad to have only paid $1.29 for this disc."
1,Title track is the only good song,Live To Win is a great rock song but everything else is just lame cheese and nothing to get excited about. I purchased that 1 mp3 on here and it's worth a buck but skip the rest unless ya like cheesy Kiss music that's not as good as their old stuff.
1,"Okay...So He's Got Nothing To Prove, But Holy Cow!","Who wrote all of these 5 star reviews? Paul Stanley?? There's not one song on here I can tolerate...AND I'm such a fan of Paul, I can't even tell you. He's probably the greatest front-man ever given to rock and roll, but I can't believe that after 28 years, this is all he's got to offer us. This album is a travesty of rock and roll justice. I'll buy the DVD when it comes out because the setlist will be much better but I have to say that Paul is a better painter and member of KISS than a solo artist. My copy of this CD is melting somewhere in the Florida sun...got no use for it."
2,Live to Win,"Live to Win being Stanley's 2nd solo album and 2006 release has here created an ok hard rock album with good vocals and quite well-written lyrics. The first track ""Live to Win"" is a good track. Unfortunately the rest sounds like standard light hard rock music and gets a bit tedious after a while. Allmusic gave the album 2.5/5. All the lyrics are included in the booklet and for each track we get a list of whom plays what. 2/5."
1,What's this?,"It sounds like second rate Bon Jovi!. Unless you are a Huge Stanley or Kiss fan who collects everything, stay away from this, it's awful!."
5,Amazing Camera,"This great machine, simply put, takes superb pictures. I have experience using a great number of point and shoot cameras and this is definitely the best. The features give a great control over what you shoot if you are so inclined to use them and know a bit more of photography. But if not you can just use the auto mode and take unbelievable pictures. Pictures I take with this camera often look better than ones I take with my 8mp canon rebel. The video is also great quality compared to any other point and shoot cameras. For the price, this camera is spectacular! If you are even considering buying it then please make the purchase, you won't be let down!"
5,Great Album!,"Okay,...I bought the CD 'cause I though the guy on the cover was cute. (sue me, kay?) Anyway, I played it in the car and ...wow! The songs are really cool, and the guy can sing as well! Nice to know there's a guy making great music and can still look like a rock star. I'm gonna get the other album too-looks like that one was great too, but I'm hooked anyway. Chris, if you read this, COOL ALBUM! Penelope"
2,$15 box,Big mistake purchasing this. This is not a chest - it is 8 inches by 16 inches. This is a very small box. Way overpriced for a simple unfinished wooden box. Adhesive could not be removed from corners after corner protectors removed.Poor choice.
2,Substandard Wooden Box,"This box is over priced for the size and quality, paid $43.19, at half the price I would consider competitive to the average consumer market. Wood panel on the bottom and top is undersized, at the top it is reinforced but not so on the bottom. In the description it says brass latches and hinges but they are only cheap brass plating on top of steel. There is glue residue/ excess on most of the notch joined edges. The quality is nothing compared to decades old wood boxes I have collected through the years for storage. Made in China."
2,waste of money,"the camera takes good pictures but after the warranty expires, problems with the lens not opening started... at first the remedy was to just turn the camera on/off for a few times. right now its totally dead... it won't open at all (after a year & a half since i bought it)...just a waste of money...very disappointed with FUJI. this is totally a lemon... can we have our money back?"
1,Exactly dead after the warranty expires,"I purchased this Fuji a345 in Oct.2005 and the Zoom problem began at last Nov. Right now, it is still working, but the Zoom is fixed at somewhere and can not make auto focus. I use to have one Fuji a330 which purchased in 2004, my brother still use it and it rocks. But this one, is really really bad."
2,Batteries get eaten up!!,"I,too, bought this as my first digital. I am happy with the quality of the pics, however, the battery issue just pushed me over the edge. After many, many missed opportunities with our first new granddaughter, my children have bought me a new Canon for Christmas. The fugi was sent back in the hopes that it could be 'diagnosed'. They just indicated ""power"" was the problem. I bought two new battery chargers and new batteries to no avail. In reading other reviews, I have noticed that the SD cards drains the battery, and perhaps we could use the xDtype H? Not sure...Fugi is willing to supply me w/a reconditioned A500 for $60. Not sure if I'll take it or not.....Just my thoughts..."
4,Good Quality Product,"This is a great heavy sweatshirt meant for cold weather. I give it 4 stars only because the description is a little misleading. It says it's a fleece. It's actually fleece-lined. The shell is 100% polyester. It is nice and shiny. Good, sturdy material."
1,Unreadable,"Behold, proof that anyone can get published in these days of vanity publishing. What a mess. The book looks like it was written and designed in one day; full of typos, mixed tenses, while void of any meaning or direction. And while the author should be applauded for his candor, he still comes off as a cheap farang utterly lacking a soul. Also, for a guy who claims to be a photojournalist, he shows absolutely no talent for either writing or photography. But the most laughable part is the bio on the back cover, where he claims to have studied Rinzai Zen for ten years. Give me a break. If someone can pursue enlightenment for that long and still willingly support the Thai sex industry, then I humbly suggest the lessons didn't take."
3,Works but Caution,"This really works, no doubt, it stops night sweats, stabilizes mood, excellent. However, I suspect I may be allergic to one or more ingredients as I developed a chronic dry cough and swollen glands in my throat. If anyone else has had this experience, please post. I'm trying to rule out each ingredient to determine which is the culprit, if any.It's definitely worth a try for you. The side effects I seem to have are not serious, so you should try and see it it works for you."
5,Keeps getting better and better!,I have watched Grey's Anatomy from the first episode's original airing and keep watching again and again. The writing is superb and just keeps getting better. I have gotten all my friends and family hooked. It's totally addictive!
5,greys anatomy the complete second season,"fantastic, great condition and price. quick delivery and great movie.recommend them to anyone purchasing a product. i will certaintly be looking for them in future purchases."
4,"Great,but....",The DVDs showed great everything showed up clear except there was this weird sticky stuff on majority of the DVDs eventually I got it of and the it was perfection
4,GREAT!,"I love this show i watch at lease 3 episodes a day i can't get enough and season two by far is one of the very best season of the whole series.I received the package very fast it did have little wear and tear on th case but the disc was perfect,not one scratch or skip."
3,Time saved,Hooray. Received before the season ended in the UK. Didn't have to watch the damned adverts. Didn't have to endure the bl**dy poor signal from Sky TV breaking up every 15 minutes. Just managed to enjoy the show when it suited us. Hooray for the DVD box-set.
5,Grey's Anatomy -The complete second season,"This show has it all, romance, drama, and a great cast, and great songs that fit the episodes. I never miss an episode. I'm buying the DVD's, so I can always watch old episodes when I want. My sister was unable to watch it when it first came out, she's catching up on the show, and is now hooked."
3,its ok,"the dvds were in great conditions, never skipped packaging was great, only problem i had was the box was different and a lot smaller then season 3 thru 8 but dvds played great"
4,Great Purchase!,I purchased this for a gift and I received it in plenty of time and everything worked out great.
5,LOVE IT!,"I live for Grey's Anatomy. This season was excellent filled with much love, drama, and changes."
5,Grey's Anatomy Season Two - Excellent Item,I was very pleased with the quality of the product i bought and the quickness of the shipping. My item arrived in time as my gift for someone for the holidays. I highly recommend.
5,Very good,"This is my dad's account, but I just wanted to share my insights on this here video. I wont' be describing all the incredibly informative sections of this insanely packed dvd. I won't even mention that Paul waste's no time with stuff that don't matter, but gets right to the point. What I will mention however, is that I got my full side and front split! And am now able to show off in my martial arts class! Moreover, my kicks have improved significantly even though this video's not focused on that. Overall I'm insanely satisfied with the results and would recommend it to anyone!Chris J."
1,Great idea. Terribe product.,"This is my first review and I am writing it because I am compelled to let others know that this is not a good product. I spent at least 10 hours trying to configure the device and at least one of those hours was spent on the phone with Linksys. I have experience with networking and quite simply this device does not work as intended. I was able to get it to work for periods of time but it stops after 5 minutes or so, or, I have to reconnect. Don't waist your time or money on this."
1,Simply does not work as advertised,"After 6 hours, mine is only working as a wired adapter from the router to the stereo, but not as a 'wireless bridge'. In wireless mode, sound is choppy and unacceptable.If you are a wireless network guru and must try this product, heed the advice in other reviews and dispose of the directions immediately (especially if you have a router) then expect frustration and disappointment for many hours.If you are expecting plug and play and are not a network wizard, I highly recommend another product."
1,YOU ARE BEING WARNED ABOUT THIS WASTE OF MONEY,I have owned this piece of useless electronics for a year. I will not go into the many hours of frustration both in wired and wireless modes to get this thing working.It is a sad testimony to an ill thought out product. It just isn't reliable. At all. You are wasting your money if you buy this.
2,Terrible setup and dodgy performance,"This was tricky to set up, in part because the documentation is horrible.Some of the 'boosters' posting reviews here gloss over the fact that the WMB must be connected to the PC via ethernet for the initial setup wizard (which disconnects that PC from access to the router, which makes getting the router info a little tricky). It's only after that setup that you move it to your living room / entertainment center and connect it to speakers.My biggest complaint is with the performance. I'm getting audio dropouts (one-second gaps in playback) at the rate of about 1 per minute. The audio quality is not very good (there's no documentation about whether the audio is being re-encoded before the wireless transmission, but I'm almost certain it is - and not with very high quality). And the integration with different media players is spotty."
2,Struggle to setup but it works,"I had quite a challenge setting this unit up, and I am a pretty technical person. It required calls and on-line help - luckily the support is good. The software that switches between local speakers and the wireless requires you to restart your computer for the settings to work. If you are willing to put up with all of that, it works very well for a bargain price."
3,Configure your connection for STATIC IP,"This thing is a bit tricky, but not impossible to set up. At ~$30 it's probably worth the hassle; for $120 probably not.See the review by Brian Cox, which details the overall setup. In order to configure the thing, you hook it up directly to your computer with a network cable. You should be able to access the setup via a browser using the IP address of the device (192.168.1.210).However, if it doesn't work on the first try, it may be necessary to configure your TCP/IP settings. The music bridge likes STATIC IP protocol, so in the TCP/IP settings panel in Windows, click the radio button for ""Use the following IP address""; then enter something like 192.168.1.17. The subnet mask should be 255.255.255.0. With these settings, I was able to connect to and configure the device--took about 30 minutes from out of the box. You can always change these settings back once the music bridge is properly configured and on the network."
1,It'll Be OK If Linksys Ever Upgrades The Driver,"I too am a semi-geek, but still had to call support for installation. Mine apparently was a return, and the doofus had changed the password, so I couldn't get in. Nowhere does it say you have to hold the reset button for 30 seconds for it to reset. I had to have an Iranian tell me.But then after installing the latest driver, the latest utility and wiring it to my router, it still skips terribly. Sometimes it sounds like a tape deck where the tape gets caught and then speeds up to catch up. So it's totally useless to me at present. But it's such a good idea and the $25 less shipping for returning it isn't worth it, so it will sit here hoping for a fix. Meanwhile, back to the wire around the wall."
1,AMAZON está muy mal,"I've ordered this product from Amazon (they are the sellers too). It was open box, the Music Bridge looks like other person tried to install it before me. It is blocked with an active password, I could't install it in my PC.I bought a new item and Amazon send me an used one."
1,Music drop-outs,"Yes, set-up isn't easy and the software could be better, but the only issue that makes this product unacceptable to me is the sound drops out about once every 4 minute song. It is only for half a second or so, but it irritates me. I even hard wired the thing so no wireless was being used and it still had the drop-outs at the same regularity. My PC is brand new and doesn't cut out the winamp music when using an audio cable. Ithink the issue is with the Linksys box hooked up to the receiver. I simply can't recommend this product even at the great price."
1,No Windows Vista driver!!!,"How can you sell a high-tech consumer product in September 2007 and don't have support for Windows Vista? According to a forum page on their website, Linksys has promised to have the driver released soon. I talked to their chatline today, and they told me the driver was going to be released soon. Since the forum page starts to mention ""soon"" back in February, I don't really trust that the drivers will be available soon."
2,Died after 3 weeks,"I had high hopes for this product when the audio section died after 3 weeks. I could still see the bridge in the utility, but no sounds came out of either the RCA or digital jacks. I initially had no trouble getting it working (I have training in IP Networking) but suspect setup would be difficult for someone untrained in IP. Support was very disappointing. Got put on hold for over 20 minutes the first call, had to drop off, second call was over an hour with an advanced tech who valiantly tried everything he could to get the product working even after I told him the audio section had died. He finally gave in and gave me an RMA. We'll see how the replacement one works. And yes, I noticed a digital delay but mine was FOUR seconds not two like other reviewers. By comparison the Apple Airport Express which I replaced with this product had a subsecond delay."
3,An ok book,"Initially, I gave a single star, as I found no valuable suggestions in the book. However, my teenage kid found some articles worth reading and hence changing the review. The book contains nothing more than a normal adult would suggest to their kid. Still feel that there are better books out there."
5,passionate songs of life,to date this cd is and will always be my favorite.from summerain to valentine these songs takes you to a magical place in time of love and fantasy.vision of you should have been a number 1 hit and if some of you havn`t heard it yet i`m sure that when you do it will become number 1 in your hearts.
3,"Cool looking, but small.","We have a garden flag pole, and this looks really silly on it because it is smaller then we thought it would be. Make sure it will fit your pole before you buy. Otherwise, cool looking!"
4,Starlight Express CD,I saw the shoe in London in 1997 and the show was great. This CD brings back good memories. The recording sounds very much like the London cast of the show I saw.
1,Not good.. there are better products out there!,I am stain stick fanatic.. I found out my fuller was discontinued and tried this for ink.. NOTHING came out.. Very sad.. but I won't rest until I find one that works as good as fuller brush was.
2,they seem to break,"i found these would get this ""snow"" problem and break open and the filling would come out. they never seemed to fit my son right either,"
5,"95% of the time, this has enough extra capacity for all night","We bought these diapers because once our kids started sleeping more then 8 hours, they'd often wet through their regular diapers (either Pampers or 7th Generation). These do the trick almost all of the time. They have enough extra capacity so the baby's clothes and bedding stay dry even when they sleep 12 hours and more and that's exactly what I wanted.Our kids have wet through these so they're not foolproof but they don't do it very often."
2,Did not work for us,"I bought this after reading the reviews here for my 8 month old. He used to wake up very frequently and we hoped the overnight diapers would help. But he slept worse, and woke up wet after just 2 hours. I tried a whole pack and it just didn't work. My son also got a bad rash after using these diapers."
2,Though the prose is pleasing hardly a scientific work,"Enjoyed reading this manuscript but I wondered if the author had himself read such works as Wallace's own ""Malay Achipelago."" The dedication of this latter book reads: ""To Charles Darwin, author of the ""Origin of Species,"" I dedicate this book, not only as a token of personal esteem and friendship, but also to experss my deep admiration for his genius and his works."" In light of this, one feels that ""Spice Island's"" fairly dismissive treatment of Darwin is rather unfair. In sum the point of view of Stevens is interesting but in the end not particularly satisfying."
5,I love it,I always thought it would be so cool to learn about Irish ghost stories and not just about the Banshee.
1,Very Boring,"I thought this would make a nice video, teaching and showing different highlights of beautiful scenary across the world... I was wrong.1) The music is of poor quality. Instead of finding a professional orchestra or other talented musical group, they have seemingly gone on the cheap. It is not inspirational or dramatic by any means.2) The scenary is unrecognizable from anywhere else on earth. One could not possibly learn anything from it, and you do not feel you are ""on a visit"". You may be looking at the fields of Italy, but that's just it, it looks a lot like the fields of Wisconsin. They failed to shoot the amazing and beautiful parts of the areas they filmed, instead opting for scenes more suitable for a comotose filled evening.If you are looking for something interesting to watch or something showcasing the beauties of earth in music and visual presentation, this is not it.I do not recommend this product."
5,It begins with a secret,"Diane Vaughan says that the death of love begins when one partner cannot hear that the other is unsatisfied. Then, the one who is unsatisfied secretly begins to leave. After that, she says, things go through stages.It seems to be true. So, if you've been dumped, or you've discovered, rather late in the day, that you're about to be dumped -- or if you're thinking about dumping someone -- read this book. It will tell you what to expect."
2,Needs to be more balanced -- too pessimistic,"I found the book a too pessimistic and to formulaic. The author paints a fascinating picture of a general breakdown of a relationship with Initiators, etc, but leaves the reader with the impression that this is an inevitable process, like the rising sun. I realize the author has approached the subject ""scientifically"" (since she 'uncoupled' and is trying to make sense of it, but I feel the book may be a bit misleading to couples who may be separated or having problems. Does the author truly believe once ""uncoupling' starts, all marriages are doomed for divorce? Is there truly no hope for these couples?"
2,"good material, but hard to read","while i really valued the content, while I am struggling through a tough time in my life, my only complaint was that it was not easy to read. Subjects were dragged too long, and I found my self reading sentences several time to get the message. There are not too may books out there on this subject, and I do appreciate the availability of this book."
1,Rayovac Re-chargeable Hybrid batteries,The charger works fine but the batteries are not performing as stated. First they died right away when put into use. after rechargingthey really didn't give the expected life or use. Hmm maybe thats why you don't see them in the stores!
4,Exellent product,"Exellent batteries, a must have.But charger sucks, I dont know why it does not want to charge my AAA batteries. It does not recognize the batteries, light never goes on"
4,"Good Intermediate Book, But Only Worth 3 Stars if You Can Program","Basically, this is a good book to get you from the initial HOT book on Flash to the more advanced tutorials found on the Macromedia Exchange site. The introduction to LoadVars and LoadMovieClip alone are worth the price of the book.My only complaint, if you can call it that, would be that if you are coming from a programmer's background, you will skim A LOT of pages. You've got to hand it to the author in how he really takes his time introducing programming to the neophytes, but I found myself actually reading only 1 page out of every 3-6.If you already know how to program in any language, you could probably find the tutorials online to get by without this book, but the expenditure in time probably wouldn't be worth the price of the book."
2,2 stars for effort,"The story and characters were lacking. I'm a big fan of fantasy with some romance thrown in but even this was pushing things for me. Everything was just to perfect. The characters flaws were lacking and might as well have not exsisted. Chime had her moments but for the most part I found her to be annoying. It was a decent read and kept me interested since I was hoping something might actually happen, but alas no such luck."
4,"Pleasing, readable fantasy, but lacking real punch","I am a huge fan of Catherine Asaro, but this book is a little bit too fluffy for me. It has the same theme as the Skolian Empire series - the ""good"" empaths vs. the ""evil"" anti-empaths who need to dominate, but the evil-doers, King Varquelle and Anvil the Forged, have been softened and weakened to the point of lacking any punch. Asaro seems to be afraid of genuine confrontation and adversity in this novel - very different from her powerful Skolian series. Iris, who takes away Chime's throne with her superior abilities, becomes her best friend. The deaf and mute king immediately loves Iris. Muller, the bumbling prince, is a refreshing character, who stumbles until almost the very end - but even here there is not enough tension. Overall a pleasant, light read, but I hope that Catherine Asaro sticks with the futuristic Cyborg novels that are her forte."
1,Don't Waste Your Money,"A charming, pleasant read... for young adults (maybe). I have never been tempted to return a book until I read this. And I have quite a few of Asaro's books--Primary Inversion is her best, I think. But in Charmed Sphere, the pacing is painfully slow, you get whole chapters of a character pondering a problem to himself that really could have taken a paragraph. And the plot: ho hum, lackluster, in a word BORING.If you love science fiction and fantasy--save your money! Asaro should be mightily ashamed of this book. It's as if the editor at Luna forced her to dumb down her writing. Read a few pages, especially the first few chapters, and you will see what I mean. Even the villain is bland. I was so disapointed!"
5,Absolutely beautiful,"I have never read Asaro's work before but after reading this delightful book, she is quickly becoming one of my favorites. The true attraction about this book was the interplay of language between Iris and her lover, the lost Prince. It isn't the deep cold realities of George R. R. Matin's Clash of Kings, but still an immensely enjoyable book for a frivolous past time. I highly recommend it to readers who are looking for a warm hearted romantic story set in a magical world where good and evil are too well defined so your loyalties will not lie elsewhere. Misted Cliff's is the sequel following the second generation and also highly recommended."
5,Am I the only one?!,"OK, OK, so this album, by CHUNKY A, is not necessarily one that you will cherish forever, and play for your kids when you are old and tell 'em about how music was so much better when you were their age.Still, you've absolutely gotta respect this record.Remember -- there was a time in which rappers DID NOT talk about racist, sexist, (...). Even though CHUNKY A talked about most of these things, he did it all for the sake of fun, in a humorous way. He was not serious -- as a matter of fact he made fun of serious rappers by releasing this album.You have to give CHUNKY A's cousin, Arsenio Hall credit, for helping this album come together. Remember, young ones, that once apon a time, it was very uncommon to see hip-hop culture on TV, and Arsenio Hall was one of the first to make it happen.Not only that, but realize that this record features a rare appearance by ICE T, along with KRS ONE! GO ahead and <i>try</i> to tell me this release was not legit!!!Show respect!"
2,Tony Toughnuts comes up empty,"Tony Jarvis's heavyhanded attempt to rewrite history offended this reader, as I saw right through his transparent praisings of John Eliot. The man who taught the Algonquin Indians to ""walk the narrow way"" (i.e. at gunpoint) is lauded as an apostle instead of being reprimanded for virtual cultural genocide...Although this book offended me as a Native American, I was quite impressed by Jarvis's frequent quotations from British literary giants and his references to his boyhood days in rural Ohio...that egg-salad sandwich story really moved me...Stop, Look, and Listen...Tony really brings it home when he anglicizes words, by spelling them in the Queen's English (e.g. Favourite, colour)...Overall, not a bad read, just a little pompous."
4,My review,Very good book it shows how the kids back then lived and how they managed to do what they loved while they supported their family
5,Listen Up! Here come Love-Cars....,"Love-Cars, one of the best up and coming rock/pop bands of today, have put out another amazing album. Its sentimental and thought inducing lyrics and singing, catchy and inspiring guitar and bass work, and one of the most impressive precussion proformances to date make this album a truly enjoyable work that will have you coming back for more. I'm Friends with All Stars is an amazing mix of everything from catchy pop anthems to somber love songs that no one should be without!"
2,"Don't forget it's the ""Glitterville Frosting"" series","This ornament is photographed so you can't see the frosting on the top. It looks completely different when held by a string from the end you can't see. The other ornaments in the Dept 56 ""Glitterville Frosting"" series have straightforward photos and will give you an idea of what the top looks like.I didn't think anything of the title ""Glitterville Frosting"" and ordered this thinking it was all orange-y stripes. I hate the frosting. I think it's a blight on a lovely thing. My roommate, however, loves it, and it's well made, so if you like the frosting thing the rating should probably go up to a 4 or even 5."
4,Great Muzzle trimmer,"I got this to trim the muzzles and eyes of my horses and it works great.. uses one battery, fits in your hand nice.. it is hard to clean and does get gummed up because of it... i spray it with show sheen and knock it a time or two (gently) on the stall and the hair comes out enough for it to work again."
4,A Fine Addition to Vietnam Memoirs,"Especially in the way the author describes LRRP missions, this memoir made me feel and smell the sweat, th mud, the paddies, etc. And fear. The courage portrayed is mind boggling and I can never understand how much it took to go into the jungle for days. As far as it goes, Acceptable Loss does give a hint. In my 'Nam studies that continue to expand, this book is right up there near the top, primarily in the memoir arena.Ron LealosAuthor of Don't Mean Nuthin'"
5,A very descriptive writer and a great accont.,I loaned this paperback to two Vietnam veterans and they both attested to it's accuracy. If you read only one book about Vietnam it should be this one.
5,Perfect Fit!,The size chart was perfect! Nothing has fit my dog as good! Description and picture match what you get. Items came on time... It was wonderful!
5,A surprisingly fantastic queer send up of aG&S Operetta,"Hysterically, funny, well sung...If you like COMEDY in your Musical Comedy, this is the CD to get."
4,C++ Book,"Its a pretty thorough book that goes into a lot of detail, and its pretty easy for beginners to use. It is similar to the text book I got for class and overall it was well worth the price, just not sure I really needed it though. Has been ok for references."
2,First few programs are Windows-specific - fails on a Mac,"The very first program in this book fails in XCode on OS X for it uses a Windows-specific subroutine: system(""PAUSE""); will not work on a Mac since this subroutine does not adhere to ANSI C++. The worst part is that the routine is being used in several other programs in the book. If you're thinking of learning C++ on a Mac, this is not your book. I don't understand how the author can claim the book teaches ANSI C++ when its first few programs clearly show it doesn't."
2,Warped image due to defective tubes or yokes on tubes.,"I have now owned this TV for 2.5 years. Fortunately I bought an extended warranty for it, because I am now having to have the tube replaced for the *second* time! The problem, in a nutshell, is that the screen image is warped on both right and left sides, giving the appearance of a magnetic warping, though I don't know what the actual cause is. As far as I'm concerned, the only good thing about this TV is the fact that it is narrower (i.e., less deep) than comparable models. I wish another company would make something like it, but of better quality."
4,Gray's Anatomy,"Though not as on target as his earlier films ""Swimming to Cambodia"" and ""Monster in a Box,"" this tale of Spalding's ""macular pucker"" and the many odd and outrageous ways he sought to solve the problem without surgery is a testament to the late comedian's legacy as a fantastic storyteller."
2,I have eye affliction subject of movie,"I was bored and only watched it because I have a similar macular pucker condition. I was looking for some serious finality. I THINK he ended up blind on his eye. For a guy about to go through this operation, he did nothing for my morale.He may think he is ""cute"" but I think he is a Jerk."
4,A 40's Time Capsule in a Book,"I arose this morning at 3:20 a.m. to learn the conclusion of the daring adventures of the two young boys. Tom Sawyer and Jim--oops! I meant to say Ted and Poodlum! This book is the perfect, clean, frolicsome summer read with an underlying strong moral theme. It's a book about friendship, curiosity, risk taking, and the cleverness of a child's imagination. I personally know childhood in this rural area during the late 40's, and Ted's talent for recall brought the entire era back to me as if it were a birthright. The author planted the seeds of necessary future change through focusing on innocence and predjudices accepted by these courageous friends of different skin color. Through puzzling encounters with 'differentness', young Ted calmly explains to Poodlum, over chocolate ice cream cones, it will fall to them to change the system when they grow up because it's the right thing to do."
5,A Great Read,"""A Yellow Watermelon"" reminds me of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Huckleberry Finn"" in that it is a great read with engaging, memorable characters and wonderful boyhood stories that also tell volumes about the small town South of the 1940's. Read it for fun, but soak up the history. This is a story that will engage young readers as well as elders who lived the 1940's era of this yarn. A wonderful cast of characters struggle with the issues such as race and economics of Post WWII South Alabama. Ted Dillon's gradual discovery of the racial double standards of South Alabama during the 1940's and his decisions to deal with it is powerful. ""A Yellow Watermelon"" is a most enjoyable and a rewarding read."
5,wow,"this is a brilliant movie but hard to get and very expensive when new so i did somethign i never do and bought a used one. the gentleman i bought it from said it had a few scratches but played just fine...i haven't watched it yet but checked it over carefully and saw no scratches anywhere, it is like brand new and the seller was very kind. this one's a winner."
5,"A wonderful movie, I have wanted to buy it for years","This movie is a about two teenagers, each trapped within their own worlds. At first all we can see is the differences in them, the things that would make each, 'one of them' - the crazy abnormal people.Then the camera moves away to pan the whole societal context of insanity and sanity. And the boundaries become far more tenuous.I hope that you enjoy this movies as much a I do."
5,Requested by name by my daughter,My 2 yo daughter asks for this video by name. She loves it and it has great learning points for her. I never groan when she asks to watch it because Pooh is tolerable if not enjoyable to watch as an adult.
2,dissapointed,"I bought this for my 3 year old son, because he watches ""My Friends Tigger and Pooh"", but we were both dissapointed. This is from the old Winnie the Pooh. It's a little boring and my son didn't want to watch it. I also bought "" Winnie the Pooh A B C's and it was the same, and it doesn't teach the entire alphabet. Don't waste your money."
1,awful,don't bother not worth the cost or even 2 cents in my opinion. Worst kindle I have ever started to read.
2,So-so,"I purchased this for my 12 year old magician-son. It was kind of cool, and kind of interesting in the way the trick worked. However, after a short time, he lost interest in it. For the money, it wasn't a bad purchase, but didn't have the longevity I was hoping it would have."
2,Bad Camera,"I was very upset when i opened this camera on Christmas. All I asked my mom for was a camera that was simple that i could take pictures with when I'm with my friends. I started using this camera and found that I couldn't see through the screen, everything was dark. The flash was just obnoxious and annoying and hurt people's eyes, and if you took a picture from a meter away of someone, the face was washed out from the flash. If you didn't use the flash the picture would be dark. I tried playing around with the settings, but nothing seemed to help.I never tried using the camera outside in the daylight, where I'm sure it would work better.Overall, I was very upset with the iZone 300"
1,screwed,terrible camera which cost me plenty because i had to pay postage to return the thing. totally screwed. thanks for asking.
1,Don't buy this camera!,"I'm all for buying inexpensive cameras. I know I'm no Ansel Adams, I just wanted a camera to bum around with. One small problem, though. You can't see through the screen to take a picture! My photographer brother even tried to adjust it and he could do nothing to remedy the situation. Don't buy this camera!"
3,What did you expect?,"I purchased this camera KNOWING that I was buying an inexpensive digital camera that I could use for fun pictures. I didnt think I would be winning any awards with the photos I took with it (I have a $300 Canon Rebel EOS for that). So far I have had some struggles (mostly with the flash) but I have to say overall Ive been pleased with the results. Once you figure out that natural lighting works best, you can get good inside pictures. I took several beautiful pictures of the Rocky mountains from an airplane window as I flew over at 30,000 ft. Ive taken some great outdoor shots as well. When you buy a $70 camera with no optical zoom and 3.2 megapixels why would you expect perfect shots without some operator effort? I say, be patient with it and figure out what works best and you'll be happy with this camera as a fun, travel camera for vacations or just amusing day to day adventures."
1,Gawd Has Foresaken me...,"I got this camera very quickly, service was fantastic. I say this because any retailer who sells these shouldnt feel too responsible for the sin that is this camera. I have had my dealings with 3.2mp cameras, some made in the 1990s and I am very appalled to have used this camera and to get this kind of low quality shot.Pictures are blurry. Well unless you use the flash, then they are completely ""pixelated"" and are engulfed in white.This is not a deal for the money, it doesnt even serve its purpose as a camera.I will say I love the design of the camera, and this just makes me want apple to delve into the camera industry.Conclusion: dont purchase this if you're looking for something to take pictures with. If you want to load this on your computer and waste your time, go for it, otherwise, buy anything else."
2,Pathetic Camera...,"This is probably the worst digital camera I've ever seen. I got it as a gift for Christmas a few years back, and I rarely used the thing. Why? The camera is simply horrible at taking photos if there's no light around. The LCD screen is practically useless; rarely can I get it to show a thing. The camera looks nice, I'll give it that, but at the price I believe it was purchased at (Around $50) it wasn't nearly worth its value. All I use it for now is as an SD card reader. Overall, don't buy this camera... there's lots of better ones out there. Even a cell phone like my RAZR has a better camera than this!"
2,"Sleek, cheap and easy","Its sleek, Its cheap and its easy to use. Its great for outdoor shots but indoor not so. Indoor shots tend to be dark even with the flash and while the flash highlights the target the skin color tends not to be true to life. I would recommend this for outside pictures but not indoors. Battery life is decent and the charger is fine. Battery life lasts longer without the use of the flash."
3,digital timer review,"I like the design and lanyard option but my first purchase had a failure of the LCD in the first week of use.The unit was replaced at no charge, and hopefully the new one will prove to be more durable."
3,Timer,This product isn't very durable. I bought several of these an in less than one week of use two have already stopped working.
2,Will purchase a more updated bread machine book soon . .,"I have to agree with the reviewer who called this book ""outdated."" My bread machine, while not a brand-new, top of the line model, has more features and settings than this book references. For example, the book often instructs you to set your bread machine on ""Bake."" Well, is that Basic, French, normal, rapid, etc.? I find myself having to guess at which settings to use, often resulting in mediocre-tasting bread with a dry texture. The tiny recipe book that accompanied my bread machine is very limited, but at least when I use any recipe found in there I get perfect bread. This book leaves much to be desired."
3,Good book but not perfect,This book was given to me as a gift with my bread machine. It has some great recipes but I tend to find some don't even work out. I follow the recipe and try them twice at least but it just doesn't work and I don't like the fact this book doesnt have recipes for a larger machine. I have a 2lb machine and 5 children to feed so would like larger loaf recipes. But not a bad book. Worth having in your collection if not for the roll recipes alone.
5,Bonanza,"The Bonanza tapes I purchased ""VERY DISSAPPOINTING"" tHE tHEME SONG WAS NOT ON IT. IT HAD THE ""PONDEROSA"" THEME. I WOULD APPRECIATE PEOPLE WOULDN'T CHANGE THE THEME SONG WITH THE BONANZA GROUP OF 59-72 VERY DISSAPPOINTING !!!!! the tapes : are ""Death at Dawn, Silent Thunder, the Crucible, Enter Mark Twain, Any friend of Walter."""
5,"A Delightful Read! Brought Me Back to My Teen Years, Only This Time I Didn't Dread It","Jenny Polack truly captures what it is to be a teenage girl and what it's like to have a best friend that means everything to you. Not only was I pleasantly surprised on how addicted I became in reading it (I couldn't put it down), but I was also impressed with how she was able to turn that awkward adolescent period into something warm and memorable."
5,Worth the cost: Excellent way to improve dog's dental health.,"We adopted a 1-1/2 year old dog, and his dental health had been neglected. After one year of eating these Iams treats once/day, the vet now says his teeth and gums look great. (Even though he's a large dog, I give him the ones for medium-sized dogs.) Our dog loves them -- it's his favorite snack. Definitely worth the money."
1,Where's the crayons?,"the ""illustration"" in this book looks 3rd to 4th grade at best. there's a couple interesting pieces but for the most part, it's lame ideas executed very poorly and sold as a new and edgy style. It also gives a little paragraph about each artist that doesn't actually tell you anything, I guess that's why I was able to pick this up for a couple dollars..If you like poorly done illustration, this is your book."
2,Returned it,"I bought this with giftcards I recieved from Christmas. The pictures came out VERY blurry. There is a hand icon that comes onto the screen when the camera shakes too much. Well every time I took a picture the hand icon came up. I adjusted settings and everything but it still came up. I would even put the camera down on a table but the hand icon would not go away. I take pictures of my kids mostly, who never hold still, and ALL the pictures came out blurry. I was very dissapointed and returned it. I got a Cannon that was only fifty dollars more and am MUCH happier."
2,Good for what its worth.,"I have had this camera for about a year. It takes excellent pictures, but it does eat batteries and recently- it finally died. None of the pictures I now take come out. Sometimes they do and sometimes they have tons of thick white scratchy lines on them. This has never happened before. I always keep everything on automatic."
2,Save your money.,"I'm just a college student, and even I was unimpressed by this camera. The timing is awkward and the pictures are often out of focus. Of course, when you can get a good shot, it's lovely. I have a cheap, old digital camera that I was replacing with this one, and it isn't NEARLY as good as my old one. Bizarre."
2,Mac user only,"While the author states that she is writting a cross platform book,she ofter fails to explain the correct way of doing things on the Windows platform. The Windows user is left to figure it out on their own. The Windows user may find another title more suitable."
2,Disappointing,"I have read and enjoyed all the volumes involving the ""No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency."" This was a book I eagerly anticipated, but found very disappointing. The stories seem to be simply retellings of very simple, but ambiguous, themes. It didn't have anything which stuck with me (except a quizzical expression on my face, I guess)."
5,What a diverse compilation of music!!,It was intriguing to hear Efatha go from a melodic melancholy instrumental to a passionate driving guitar piece. Beautifully woven songs.
3,"Battery works fine, was not as advertised","I ordered, paid for and expected a GE Rechareable battery. I got a compatible model, but it was not a GE battery, nor was it a name brand. It is possible that the company also makes and sells these batteries to GE - but I ordered a ""GE"" replacement battery. I could have paid less had I wanted a no-name battery at the outset. The battery is working fine in the phone, but I have no idea if the specifications and reliability meet the GE requirements."
1,Quote-mining because they have no real evidence,"Quotations taken out of context, edited to fit their meaning, taken from personal letters that are difficult to verify, or taken from minority opinions in the scientific field is what you can expect from this book. Why not save yourself the money and make up quotes yourself?"
3,Miss the Original Spartacus -,I enjoyed this series - but the new guy is too young - and the character development is too weak and slow...
3,not as good as the first season,this was okay it continues the story. And I guess I just am prejudiced about the new lead actor. He was good but I miss the gy who died from cancer from the first series.
3,so so violence interrupted by sex,"If you liked Kirk Douglas as Spartacus, you're going to hate this Spartacus. The original Blood and Sand series had better writing. This series, Vengeance, was written by writers banging their ""tools"" on the key pad hoping for anything intellligent to come. eh-hem,Come out"
3,So So not as good previous,decent story line but the action shots way overused the slow motion.....kinda made the whole thing a little cheesey. The new actor couldnt lace the boots of the previous spartacus but i guess you have to take what you when an actor dies.
2,New Spartacus,"The main character is weak. He does not play the role of the original Spartacus to a satisfactory level. He looks fragile and week physically and his emotional demeanor makes him appear frail and his candor only attributes to this. He lacks the presence, mostly in his eyes. Other characters do well in their continued roles.I only watched the first two episodes. It wasn't worth paying for. The new lead character is wack..."
1,Disappointed,"The first two seasons were awesome. This one was a waste of time and money. The show seemed forced, too much focus on CGI and not enough on plot, and the adult scenes were pointless. My husband didn't even want to finish watching it. I only saw the whole thing because I couldn't sleep one night. It was that bad. In my opinion skip it, leave the memory of the good Spartacus intact."
2,Cheap,"Poor quality glass with huge, rough seams. Received in boxes that looked well-worn, and the fixtures themselves were dusty and scratched, like they'd been display items. I returned immediately."
5,Works for me!,Mounts easily. I just use it to hang my Ipod. It gets it off the seat and off the console. Looks good too.
1,ive never read the books,"ive never read the entire book, just the samples. but the reviews are always 50-50 but i really wamt to read it. i LOVE the show!!;>"
3,An ok read,"Frankie Franconi is in a bomb shelter when she meet British Officer Nick Harper. Nick is so taken with Frankie that he gives a card with a Baker Street address. So Frankie finds herself working with FANYs as a decoder overseas. Afer Nick goes missing Frankie decides to behind the lines to find the man she loves.""We'll Meet Again"" is the first book by Hilary Green that I have read. It was an ok book, but not anything special. To me the characters lack emotions and I wished that the story was longer. Overall ""We'll Meet Again"" was an ok book but its not a keeper for me."
4,A smooth beginning... a dense ending,"Sue Groom tackles a difficult subject in Linguistic Analysis of Biblical Hebrew, and in a short space, the application of modern linguistic analysis on an ancient (and unspoken) language. Part one is highly readable and for beginners in the topic. In Part two, Groom gets denser but still remains in the realm of a layman's comprehension. It is only in Part three where the text gets nearly unreadable due to the overabundance of unexplained technical language. This makes Linguistic Analysis a work which is overwhelmingly for the semi-specialist in the field; the novice should be prepared to do some work here or stay away from this dense but smartly written book."
5,Great Tach,"Bought this so I know what my truck is doing while i'm working on various things.Easy to hook up, looks good and comes with everything you need."
1,Very disappointing,"I've purchased bulk groceries thru Amazon for several years now. People don't buy cases of a product to be consumed in a few months so expiration dates ARE very important. I just read the expiration date on these...March 28, 2013. Had THAT been clearly stated on the product information, I would never have made the purchase. A short five month expiration period on a bulk purchase should be posted to consumers. Extremely disappointed."
2,not recoil well,"I brought this in 3/2011 and in 1-2 months' time, the coil already out of shape and hanging down touching the floor."
3,Old book purchased from Amazon,This was an old book and the information seemed dated. There is some good information in the book but I would prefer to have something with more up to date information and studies.
2,Wish Fulfilment and Earnest Posturing!,"Considering the exceptional cast Commander in Chief never really rises above gentle wish fulfilment and earnest posturing.The problems are all due to the rather uninspired scripts. These people have spent their lives in politics, for God's sake, and then enter the White House behaving and acting like Saints. Does that ring true?The First Lady gag involving the President's husband is very poorly delivered. The President's Husband is a very badly drawn character. The family are two-dimensional. The Production values look good and the Production Design is very well done.With a wilder-than-fiction President already in Office in America it must be enormously hard to invent one and give it any sense of authenticity."
5,C in C - part 1,"Great TV show, too bad it was cancelled!I am pleased to be able to watch it again at my leisure."
5,Extreme Riding!,"This video's been out for a while now, I remember going to the premiere at The Palace in LA, It was a blast.This video has it all, downhill, singletrack, trials, tricks, and an energetic soundtrack.When you can't be out there, this is the next best thing."
2,Leaves stains,"This product was recommended following my surgery as an adhesive liquid to secure dressings between dressing changes. However, it leaves noticable stains, not only on the wond dressings, but on clothing as well. Would not recommend."
3,Used it to try toughening skin on my heel.,"I bought this product after reading that it can work to toughen skin around my heel to improve comfort while hiking with heavy boots. After applying it numerous nights in a row, I haven't found my skin is any more ""tough."" It certainly would help bandages adhere, but I'm not sure it works for toughening skin."
5,Tincture of Benzoin,This is the absolute best product in the world for cold sores....it dries them up right away if they've started.
3,"Beautiful to look at, but formulaic text.","This book is one of a ""breed"" series by these well-known dog-subject publishers. Although it is beautifully produced with great photos, it contains several errors about Brussels Griffons probably due its generic, cookie-cutter format wherein much text is applicable to ANY breed. Also the book is filled with advertising for various dog foods & products which I, for one, resent."
3,Information not updated,"I have not read the whole book, as I was interested in info on autism and SID. However, the stats it gives for autism is 2 in 10,000. With all the awareness out there now on autism stating that it is now in fact 1 in 166, I did not even bother to read further. The information is not up to date on these issues. If you are buying it for other reasons, I'm sure it would be fine. Good Luck..."
2,Dissapointment,"I owned an Empire Brass CD before I bought this one. Unfortunately, I think this CD suffers the same limitation as my other one, which is,the trumpets are simply too overpowering. Anyone that has listenend to brass ensembles knows it takes balance between all instruments to sound good. I realize that many times the trumpets carry the melody, however that doesn't mean that the french horn, trombone, and tuba should barely be heard. The lower instruments give the music its body. I think this CD contains really good music and the arrangements are nice. However, the unbalanced playing spoils it. Listen to the track of Nun danket Alle Gott - the trumpets are supposed to be the harmony - the organ has the melody. You would never know it by listening to this CD. The same goes for a Mighty Fortress. I will never buy another Empire Brass CD again. To me this outfit is just a bunch of Canadian Brass wannabees."
5,Great product.,This second camera worked out very well for me. I use it in my toddler's room in order to view more of his room now that he is out of his crib. It's awesome... I switch from A to B to view him in his room and that is much better than carrying around two hand held pieces.
1,hate this stupid thing!!,"Do not buy, what a waste!!!! It is SUPER loud and the bubbles are COLD! so unless you can fill your tub with scalding hot water and want to relax with the noise of a running car next to your ear don't buy this!!"
1,The Nursing Mother's Guide to Weaning,"The title should really be, ""You are a horrible mother for deciding to wean your child!"". Almost all the information in the first 4 chapters was a repeat of the information in the ""Nursing Mother's Companion"". I found nothing very helpful about this book and I felt like they hardly addressed weaning or the problems with it you may encounter."
1,This was terrible,This ways one of the worst albums i've ever heard. Sublime is a great band but this was terrible and the songs are really boring. If you are thinking of buying this album and have only heard a few songs from them or none don't buy this CD because you'll hate them forever. To be honest I didn't want to even give this album a star but the other sublime CD's are good
1,"a tragic, horrible mistake.","second-hand smoke made me lose alot of respect for sublime. when the sole talent of the band passed away, the remaining fools loaded a cd full of mostly junk, just trying to make a buck. Forty-Oz. is a great album, and this is nothing like it. Stay away from this one."
4,the astrology of self discovery.,This is the second book by Tracy Marks that I've read and I like the succinct way she presents her information.
5,Buy this DVD--You can thank me later,"I cannot lie: I am a huge RLJ fan. I have all of her albums, and I have seen her live on ""The Late Show"" and ""Saturday Night Live."" I, however, wasn't prepared for what is on this DVD. Ricki Lee Jones is amazing live. She seems a little out of it--she changes words, talks to herself a bit here and there, and her eyes are a little glazed over (you know how she is), but I must admit it all seems to come together in a performance you will not forget. The first time you hear the way she changes the songs, you're a little wierded out, but, the next thing you know, you are singing the songs with the changes in them, wishing she had made more.I called two friends while I was watching it for the first time to tell them that they had to go order it. You should order it too. Really."
2,Not for youth--rather young adult,"I bought this workbook hoping it would be an additional resource for young transgenders 11-17 In reality, more for the 20+ year olds."
1,Many of these reviews must be fake.,"I can watch and enjoy really bad movies, but this one just takes the cake. At times when there should be tension, I felt annoyed at the implausibility of the acting. These reviews must be fake because this movie is really really bad."
3,Costly Expensive but a must have.,"I'm not quite sure why the book costs so much. It may be because it's so old. The information is pretty good. They describe just about every Liberty ever built. There are stats, dates, times, places and everything. Some operational history as well. I would have been happier with a hardcover and more photos. Better photos would help one understand the complex changes made to some ships of the class. The book does not include current status on the 2 preserved ships-Brown and O'Brien since it was written while they were still non operational."
3,Quantitative Evaluation,"Audio Merits:5/10; Video Merits:8/10;Musical Merits:7/10; Cinematographic Merits:7/10;Overall Artistic Performance:7/10; DVD Extras:6/10;Recording Total Quality:7/10. Professor's Comment:: Requiem: Mozart's Climax;Sir Colin Davis:Perfect,;Orchestra,Soloists and Chorus:Mediocre."
2,Not bad,"In my opinion this CD is not one of the best Gibson's products. I find that the music is dull, intrusive and not very well matched with the theme. Howling featured in two tracks doesn't match either: it may be that of a monkey but it sounds pretty much like a wolf. For the price is not a great deal."
4,Fun Repoman Romp,"Fun romp featuring repo men (and women) of DKA as heroes versus gypsy clans. The king of American gypsies has died, and the clans from around the US are vying to have their leader be selected as the new king. To this end, they are stealing Cadillacs left and right in order to show up in the proper style at the big gathering where the new king will be selected. Lots of fun to be had as Gores skillfully describes scam after scam after scam, both by the gypsies and the repo men. Both groups are sympathetically portrayed for the most part, and the background detail about modern gypsy life is interesting in its own right."
3,SOLID........NOT TOO BAD,"ALLURE is one of my favorite female groups and I was very suprised when I heard they were releasing a new album. I thought it was over for them when they released their sophmore album. I thought their sophmore album was good but didn't get any promotion just like this album. In order for a album to sell, you must promote it. I haven't seen them on TV or heard anything on the radio.Even though they're short one member, ALLURE still proves that they can harmonize and compete with other female groups. They've stuck to their old style of music along with a new sound which is blended in. My favorite tracks so far are HATE 2 LUV U and LET HIM GO.Overall, these girls delivered a good album with hot tracks but promotion however is needed desperately."
2,"ALLURE, ARTEST, BRASKA?","I can't really say im a huge Allure fan, I really only liked ''Head over heels''. But i guess their bac with this new album which to me is well(thinking) not that good,and not that bad. Hey Ron Artest's name on the front cover of the album? what was that about really, and the cheezy album cover of the girls(their worst album cover EVER.) bUT I NEVER PAID ATTENTION TO MOST OF THE ALBUM ONLY ''HATE 2 LOVE YOU'' WHICH IS THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM, ''LONG LOST LOVE'' A GOOD I MISS MY FIRST LOVE TYPE OF SONG WHICH FEATURES BRASKA A NEW UP AND COMING RAPPER(HE SOUNDS GOOD)NOTE 2 MR. ARTEST, BRASKA SHOULD BE UR NEXT ACT. THEN THERES THE REST OF THE ALBUM WHICH I DID NOT CARE FOR AT ALL. BUT HEY IF U LIKE AN ALBUM THAT HAS 2 HOT SONGS THIS IS 4 U. GOOD LUCK ALLURE HEY I SUPPORTED THE ALBUM, THERES NO ''LONG LOST LOVE'', JUST MY $13.98."
5,My Very Favorite Perfume...,Miracle So Magic! by Lancome for Women 3.4 oz Eau de Parfum SprayI absolutely love this perfume and get so many compliments when I am wearing it. It is unfortunate that the Department stores no longer carry this item but I couldn't be happier to be able to find it online. A must for all ages...
3,"Some good, some bad, overall OK","First off you can save a bit of cash by getting this ep as a bonus cd with the aussie release of greatest hits.As far as the tracks go what i got (kahne radio edit) is lame, cuts out the swear words (and pot) and the music behind it so you get a silent spot :|The other songs have been released on a variety of singles and a couple on albums, more a compilation ep than anything else. Solid ep with some great songs, some not so great, get cheap if you can."
2,Fisher-Price ready 2 wear monitor,It has been found belatedly that the rechargable battery set up of 120 volts is not compatable with Australia's 240 volt electrical standard and the item is unusable in Australia.
3,"Exelent Quality,... medium plot.","Well, I have wait to see the second season till the DVD, the qualiti of the product is exelente, no complains at all.But the plot of the show... is like... boring. I do not think i am going to buy the third season."
5,Get Lost in Lost the complete 2nd season,"I couldn't stop watching this- often up till 4or 5 in the morning- unlike the 1 st season which was great, there is a lot of interesting background on all the featured charcters and storylines-i finished it just in time for season 3!!!!I want more LOST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!LOL"
2,They Forget To Pay The Electric Bill?,"I thoroughly enjoyed the first season set. However, this set is so darned dark all the time.If the director is attempting to attain film noir status, he/she is successful. Half of the scenes shown are totally black, and one must strain the eyes to see anything but darkness.The characters are well written with Sawyer being the kind of fellow you do not want your son to emulate. Michelle Rodriguez' character is intense, tough, and the kind of person I'd want backing me up in combat.Hurley's bulk makes him almost disgusting to watch albeit the actor does a great job of playing a heavyweight sumo wrestler. With all the mysterious and beneficial powers inherent to the island, I wonder why the island has not cured his obesity?I probably will not order Season 3 when it comes out on DVD."
2,Huge letdown after season one,"The writers took a character-driven television show and turned it into just another dramatic sci-fi show. Rather than continuing the proven formula that led to terrific ratings and post-season accolades, they transformed the show into the same sort of tired script that already exists on television. Hopefully, in season three, the writers will make a determined effort to restore the development of the characters, placing their stories at the center of the struggles on the island. If not, the lower ratings and award show snubs will continue. At this point, this is a show in decline that desperately needs a change in direction."
1,Great initial idea poor story line,"Too many things on this second series make this series weak.Some make it riduculous, with all due respect, the famous hatch, has a main entrance?What is the point then for having a 90 feet hole with a bullet proof glass when there is another entrance.During the show the 2 main characters start fighting over who is better? This is on a desert island where they are trying to survive?The jungle from episode one had some sort of ""invisible dinosaur"" walking around and then what happens to it? Does he goe to sleep for 2 years?I honestly think that this tv show could have been great but instead it really makes ""Buffy the vampire slayer"" like an intellectual scientific show."
1,It was a late Birthday gift,"I ordered this product two weeks before my friends birthday and it didn't come until the end of the next month. Not only did it not arrive until after the late deliver by date, but it was even a week after that. Not sure what happened, but being a late birthday gift is not appreciated."
4,Paid for two!,"I was set two copies and paid for two copies and only wanted one, I still have one unopened in the box it was shiped can I get my money back?"
4,The Lost Saga Part 2,"The quality of the DVD set is great and the show pretty much speaks for itself. I was a little dissapointed in the extras for this set. The extras on the Lost Season 1 were much better, this one almost seemed like they knew people would buy it, so they didn't need to put much effort into it.The packaging is a pain too (since you have to unfold the whole thing to access all the CDs and there are overlapping discs so you have to pull one out to get to the next, but it's all just minor things."
5,Nice continuation,"The second season starts out slow in terms of new things happening. There are quite a few episodes where character development and background information seems to be the main emphasis while the actual plot is put on hold. In my opinion tough, this slow buildup pays off in the more speedy episodes (especially the last few episodes) by giving the audience an experience unrivaled by any other TV series."
3,CUTE but wrong size,I've been buying smalls for my minpin for all his clothes and they keep coming inand don't fit around his chest.This time I ordered a medium but it's HUGE and he walks right out of itI should've followed the size guard for once because a small or even an extra smaller would have fit better.Very adorable pattern though.
5,The sweetest gadget ever.,This tool is amazing. I keep it in my wallet (it really is the size of a credit card) and use it all the time. My only advice would be to *not* forget that it's in your wallet and attempt to take it through Airport Security.
2,I THINK THIS IS JUNK,I have not found a single use for this piece of junk yet.It looked good but I sure got fooled........
5,"Lost my copy, got another one...excellent book for Holocaust Students",Of all the Holocaust books I have purchased this is the best for it sums up the entire history from day one to 1945.The book was in excellent condition as described.
1,Buyer beware,"If you purchase this product, I hope you are completely satisfied. It is my opinion that the reliability of Panasonic products has slipped in recent years, and this was confirmed to me recently when a product I purchased quickly failed. The reason I'm posting this is to warn you that the warranty that accompanies Panasonic products only has value if the company chooses to stand behind it. In my case, they weaseled out of it, leaving me with a total loss and no further recourse. Good luck with your decision."
4,It really improves the texture of your hair!,"This product claims to moisturize, soften and is non-greasey! It does soften your hair and moisturize it, i use it while my hair is damp and it looks great! However i have extreemly sensitive skin, thus can't use anything greasey or has oils, or i will 'break out'. Because it says it's non-greasey i didn't think it would have oils in it but it is an oil base product and therefore i am unable to contiue to use it. If your not someone sensitive to oils, then i would recommend this product! I used it for ONLY 5 DAYS and my hair started to improve so much. It also have a refreshing scent(smells something like tea tree).I find the people at this company VERY plesant to deal with, great service!"
4,good but not as great,"good but not as great, as i was expecting, does not feel much relief from back pain"
3,very good for its price,"My dad has a massager from Brookstone (called the Max I think) with a similar design but the heads travel in and out farther giving a more energetic massage. His cost $200. The Homedics one feels somewhere between a true percussion massage and a vibration massage.The true test came after I went on a 7 hour hike. My calves were very sore. I did a 5 minute massage on them and next morning felt great. My quads, which weren't as sore and which weren't massaged, were still sore the next day. So I think this massager does what its supposed to do and isn't just a gimmick."
4,A well made massager from a good firm,This is my second Homedics massager and this model is slightly less powerful then the model that I bought a few months ago. That one also had more features and accessories.The Homedics machines are well built and quite helpful for muscle pain and tenderness. Look at the features carefully as there are a number of models available from Amazon.
3,"This is a pretty good product, but not strong enough.","I purchase this massage machine is because it is not expensive. For the cost verse quality, it is a good deal. However, in the highest vibration setting, it is too weak compare with Korean made ""Mediness"" similar product. This product provides continous strength adjustment and head replacement. Because the strongest vibration setting is not strong enough, the adjustment feature becomes useless. If you don't expect stronger vibration, it is a bargain."
3,wave massager,"This product, as a vibrating massager it is pretty good, but there is little or no ""wave action"". The massager seems to be mislabeled as a wave massager, but as a vibrating massager it does have pretty good movement."
2,This product has gone soft.,"I had the older model that was great, really felt like you went to a professional but this model feels like nothing. I am sorry I threw my old one away and did not have it fixed.Come on homedics lets do much better on the design."
1,Two stiff balls,"All the reviews seem to rave about the product, I gotta wonder if it's the same thing! It's two vibrating round balls, they don't wiggle up or down, left or right - just vibrate. My boyfriend doesn't like it and neither do I."
2,Bad Vibrations,"I own a different HoMedics messager that I love (I can't find a model number on it). I bought this one to have at work, I was disappointed with it because it is much less intense even on the hightest setting. I can barely feel the vibrations and the massager does little to relax my muscles."
2,movie house,this movie was not at all like i thought i can't say it was bad i just thought from the parts they showed on tv that this movie was going to be better. yes i would watch it again but not my best watch. thanks movie house
2,Dear John Doe,"So, what would one do with a 4-digit IQ, and beinglimitless in intelligence? Why, join Wall Street orthe government of course! As they say, birds of afeather flock together.So, I entreat you, my fellow Limitless viewers andreviewers, that we excuse the deeply entrenched corruptionof Wall Street and ""our"" government. Let us turn a blindeye to the wounded housing market, the high unemploymentrate, the Fed's questionable bailouts and the government'ssubtle and relentless trampling of our rights. Why, youmay ask? Simply because with our abysmally limited brainswe cannot comprehend our shepherd's unmeasurablebrilliance.And how could a writer with an IQ slightly above 100possibly fathom what a man with a 4-digit IQ would do?"
1,"I LOVE THE MOVIE, but was sent a bad digital copy!",I just tried to download the digital copy for my disc and it won't download. I turned the disc over and sure enough there are manufacturing defects in the disc. You can see where the burning process skipped in several areas. Very embarrassing for Amazon and the company that they used to sell it. Unfortunately it is past the time for me to exchange it. Please help Amazon if you see this.
2,BLU RAY DISC IS DISSAPOINTING - (Not A Movie Review),"Great Movie - BUUUUUUUT I would not buy this crappy Blu Ray Disc! Ususally when you watch a movie you can SKIP the previews - Not in this one! They force you to watch the 10-20min of previews everytime u put it in before you get to the menu! No skipping them whatsoever! What if I want to watch this 5, 10 years down the road? Id have to watch these old ass previews?? HATE THAT!! Also, every time I watch this and it gets to the part where he is cleaning his apartment after taking NZT for the first time THE SOUND SHUTS OFF!!! WTF?? If I rewind it back then the sound comes back on. This happens every time I watch it! HEY - YOU DONT WANT PEOPLE TO PIRATE MOVIES?? Quit selling CRAP!"
2,Arrrrgh!,"When I start this movie it launches into all of the previews, as it normally does. However, It is completely locked so I cannot skip, fast forward, rewind, anything. I have tried every button on my Sony BD player and the only ones that work are the stop, which starts all of the previews again and back which starts the individual preview again. It is somewhat infuriating that this movie is completly locked down so you can not even speed through the previews. The movie is ok I guess."
4,Wow! Something totally different.......,"This film is a nice change of pace, something different than the norm. A man takes a magic pill and transforms into a genius but not without consequences and one big sht storm. The acting was good, story good and unique, direction good, vibrant colors, cinematography good, dialog really good. Overall 4-1/2 Stars. I will always tell it like I see it.Scott M"
1,Unacceptable!!!,Studios have decided that you MUST watch fifteen minutes of previews in order to watch this blu ray. Don't support this practice by purchasing this movie. Torrent it instead.
4,Very interesting concept,"I really liked this movie, narration and all. The real question of ""what would you do?"" just begs to be answered, and yet not many reviewers have answered it. I for one, would be very tempted to try NZT, fortunately I would also be too chicken! But wouldn't it be nice to have be ability to access everything just some of the time. If you don't get too nitpicky about details, you will enjoy this movie."
1,Epic FAIL!,"This Blu-Ray DVD locks the user not only from being able to skip the previews but it also locks the user out from being able to fast-forward through the previews. So, every time I put this DVD to watch the movie from where I last left off, I am forced by the stupid studios to sit through the same 10 minutes of FORCED previews that I can't skip or fast-forward through. This forced lock by the studio not only keeps customers from being able to enjoy their movies but is extremely disrespectful. EPIC FAIL!"
3,"Is Good, only good.","Is a fantasy film, not fiction, the idea about a pill is very elemental not apport nothing new, has a good Art Director, good actor."
2,really?,"this film has a ton of good reviews & i am, generally speaking, in agreement with the masses on action flicks. this is the exception. the first 15 minutes are pretty darn good, but after that the plot begins to fray at the edges - and eventually, it comes apart. perhaps the issue (for me) is that there is very little character development for any of the supporting roles? the lack of resolution to what would seem to be pretty major events? the vast leap in direction in the last few minutes? or the totally anti-climatic ending? likley a bit of all.this would be a great series for one of the networks to pick up...and if a writer were to follow all of the heretofore unpursued angles presented in the film? i betcha they'd get an easy 2 or 3 seasons out of it without searching for new ideas.no. i wouldn't recommend this film. as excited as i was to see it - it was a let down. but a whole lot of other folks liked it..."
5,A movie you can watch more than once,"I saw this movie in theaters and thought it was good so I bought it for my Dad's Birthday. I liked it the first time and I liked it the second time, and I would probably watch it again. Edward is going no where fast with his writing career until he runs into his ex-wife's brother who gives him a pill that gives him full access to his brain. The short term effects are great for Edward he's motivated, smart, and gets rich quick...however, like with any drug there are consequences. The action in this movie keeps you entertained and the plot twists are great.I did watch the alternate ending and I am definitely glad that's what it was, ""the alternate"" because the real moving ending was much better."
5,Limitless Coolness,"Limitless is a fascinatingly good movie about Eddie Mora's rise to power using a brain-stimulating drug called NZT. The first time he pops this drug, a whole new world opens up to him because his brain is operating at maximum power. Very cool to watch this happen. Even cooler is that there are others who know about NZT and some are using it themselves. What unfolds is a dangerous game of minds to see who comes out on top. Bradley Cooper gives a great performance and so does De Niro."
2,great idea but didn't suit my needs,"The bubbles and massage felt good, but the heater didn't impress me. The air from the bubbles cools the water immediately and the heater couldn't recover the temperature. What I couldn't find in the instructions but learned after emailing the company is that you can't use bath salts or foaming foot soaks in it because of the bubble holes. Bottom line: heat and bath additives were too important to me. I returned the spa and will continue to use a large dishpan instead."
1,O STARS!!!!,"Complete garbage. I wouldn't wipe... you know. Complete heresay, made up lies about a great man. This not worhty of being thrown in the trash with my other trash. Please get the book ""Harrison"" published by rolling stone and released with Olivia Harrisons permission."
1,Terrible,"This book is one of those ""I'm lost until I find myself"" themes that is simply a waste of shelf space. It's incredibly boring and I wouldn't really recommend it."
5,Heart-breakingly beautiful,"What an incredible fresh new voice... I want to find An Na and urge her to write more. I felt this book broke my heart open in the most beautiful of ways... She made me think deeply about the experience of coming to the US as a young child and acclimating, along with one's parents, perhaps more quickly than one's parents, to a brand new language and culture. Her language is clean, clear, pure, beautiful, precise, sparing... this is a must read, hands down."
5,Also good for persons relocating,"Wonderful story and very real, while reading this I thought it to be a good lesson book also. A lesson in general to anyone who has never traveled outside their home country. Our cultural differences from Korea are huge, and heaven is what you make it. I was in Korea for 3 years, I found much natural paradise there. But as for this story, it's a beautiful read, go for it, it will teach you something about the USA that you...Already know but didn't give it much thought. A super book that brings our cultural differences together in a nice story like this is SB 1 or God by Maddox"
1,Rolypig Composter,"I purchased the Rolypig composter almost a year ago. The pig looks great, and gets lots of comments from the neighbors, but is pretty lousy at creating compost. It was easy to assemble, and is easy to roll and move around, even for a small person, but I've emptied the ""tail end"" many times, over the past year, only to find partially composted scraps. I've reduced the size of the scraps, and balanced the carbon and nitrogen as the company suggested, but no useful compost yet. In addition, the pink pig is fading fast (no longer hot pink, but pale pink), and the fiberglass head is starting to crack. I'm pretty disappointed in the pig. I really wish it would've worked like the company claimed. Save your $230-350, and buy a composter that actually works. Good luck!"
5,A good book to read aloud,"This is a children's picture book written in the classic English Manor House Mystery style-- complete with a dinner party, distinguished guests, missing jewels and, of course, the butler, Piggins. I won't give away who ""did it,"" but kids will have fun solving the mystery as you read the book to them. Part of the fun is looking at all the details in the drawings of the house. I highly recommend this book."
5,Tigger Fanatic,My daughter loves Tigger and was very happy to recieve this item. She gets to pack her own clothes and loves to pull it along. She also has to kiss tiger a few times :).
2,might have been good except....,"I bought this product because of the reviews that I read here but once I turned the machine on, it would not turn off. It had to be unplugged. Not only that, all of the features ran at the same time."
5,HoMedics FR-500 Foot Rejuvenator Bubbler Footbath,"My feet are getting old (but NOT the rest of me) and they really love to be pampered at the end of the day in this footbath. I think the best feature is the 2-speed spinning rollers that massage the bottoms of the feet...it feels wonderful. I use them first and then immerse my feet in the water to enjoy the benefits of the vibrating bottom and the bubbling action. If I could improve anything, it would be to make the bubbling more forceful, but I'm sure there are limits on how much can be done in a small unit like this versus a full-sized jacuzzi.I can't attest to how well it keeps the water warmed because the weather has been hot and I've only been putting cool water in the tub. But I think that keeping the feet cool while massaging them is an extra benefit. My feet feel so refreshed after using this unit, and I would highly recommend it to others."
2,"I'm sorry, but this is not the one...","Unfortunately, i was not fully happy with this product. ""Bubbler Footbath with Infrared Heat"" doesn't really do much. I really didn't know the whole point of bubbler or the infrared heat. The water got cold after 10 minutes, and ""Infrared heat"" just tickles your foot. It's hard to pour the water out from the unit after you are done. I also thought the power cord was too short if i want to use it from the sofa that's far away from the power source. The spinners made even more mess after the ""water"" bath. the water would go all over my carpet. After using it once, i've made so much mess...I gave the gift to my parents, who are working/standing 18+ a day, but they didn't use it after the first day. Kinda sad... It's inefficient and incovinent in my opinion. sorry..."
2,Camera died after 6 months.,"At first I thought this was a great camera, the only downfall was the batteries would drain too quickly. It was also annoying that the batteries and picture card were under the same cover. I bought this camera in July 2006. Then in January 2007 it completely died on me. I couldn't even get the lens to close. I finally brought it to a repair shop and they said the motherboard went on it. The total cost for labor and parts would be $128. I checked and for the price this camera is selling for I'm not sure if it's worth it to repair."
4,Good camera for the novice & expert,"We replaced our 2.1 pixel camera with the E900. We're not experts but, it is easy to use, takes wonderful pictures. It seems to be especially good in low-light conditions without using the flash. If it was more compact, I would give it a five."
5,Outstanding camera,I chose this camera as I wanted one with which I could document my artwork in a pixel size that would do it justice. I was amazed that I could actually take photos of fireworks at night!
2,Wit's End's wit is REALLY ending!,This is the worst game ever! I am twelve and it really doesn't appeal to me.
1,The Hero of Everest Without the Heart and Soul,"Thorough, informative and well authenticated but wholly lacking in literary style and readability. As I read the book I thought ""with all this information a good editor and the benefit of literary style could have vastly improved the effort!"" In reading the book I did discover that I am an unswerving 'linear reader'. No matter how bad the writing became I remained steadfast to the end hoping that this book could redeem itself. This effort will not be seriously considered a notable contribution to the history of climbing Everest. For that sort of book I recommend reading elsewhere."
2,Depressing,"First off, let me say that I think BLONDIE is one of the best bands ever. Period. But this concert comes to us from a very low point in their career. Back in 1982, BLONDIE was on its last legs (the first time around). They all hated each other, Frank Infante was suing the band and has been last-minute replaced by some black guy. Chris Stein was at the beginning stages of a disease that almost killed him - and it shows. Debbie had already released a solo album at this point and looks very bored. Even BLONDIE didn't like themselves at this stage in the game.If you are a big fan, you will want to pick this up as a timepiece. But if you are trying to get a video that will capture the energy of ""Call Me"" or ""One Way Or Another"" - for God's sake - steer clear of this depressing monstrosity of a concert!! There are much better choices out there!!"
2,Not enough Product for the Money,"I would have thought this item was coming in a gift basket or bucket. However, it arrived in a ""nice"" plastic bag. It is a really small gift set. I thought it would have been larger. For what I paid, $11.99 Plus $3.99 S&H, should have returned it and went to the local Drugstore to pick one up. I would have paid less locally."
5,An outstanding book,"An outstanding book in meta mathematics, taking us from beginnings of meta mathematics with Hilbert and Godel through to the randomness embodied in omega, the halting probability.The trail moves through Leibniz, Godel's incompleteness, Turing's halting and incompleteness, to Algorithmic Information Theory which proves the key to finding Omega, the number whose bits show irreducible randomness in mathematics.The writer assumes no major existing knowledge, but leads you quickly into high ground.Some discussions also touch on philosophy and the history of ideas.His enthusiasm is infectious; a great read."
1,too full of himself,"sorry, i just cannot read this book - try it and you will realize soon why! the author believe that he is a genius. if your answer now is - who cares - please note that 50% of the book is about math while 50% is just about how great the author is... maybe culture plays a role here and the book works for Americans, but if you are from Europe do not even touch it....."
3,Fascinating ideas in dire need of a good book editor,"I was looking forward to reading this book. The ideas presented, Chaitin's life's work, are fascinating and incredibly interesting. Although most of the material can be found online, e.g. on Chaitin's website, they are presented here in a more organized and more ordered form. There aren't many mathematical proofs, mostly just hand-waving and intuitions, but the ideas are usually clearly conveyed.However, it seems that Chaitin couldn't really decide what kind of book to write, math, philosophy or romantic novel. The result is a sometimes incoherent blend of 2-bit philosophy and romantic musings about math, sex and life. I would rather have liked to read each in a separate book, and not all jumbled up, sometimes in the same paragraph. Seems like a good editor is the thing most missing from this book."
4,"Plus 220 pages of additional content, minus color","The book description refers to the book as ""this full-color volume"" in error. The update from Photoshop/Imageready 7 to CS has added 220 pages of content, but to hold the same price point, it was necessary to produce the book in black and white. I really miss the color. I occasionally purchase a Photoshop book that is not in color, but with one exception (Deke McClelland's Look and Learn Photoshop 6), they always end up being returned.Don't let me discourage you from buying the book -- it's still a great resource, even more so since Ben Willmore's Photoshop CS Studio Techniques no longer discusses web/Imageready topics -- but please be aware that it's not ""in full color."""
4,Good,"This is a good CD. Lynch and Bo can flow and do on this CD. they are good together and there are many tight songs, some to chill to and others that are more upbeat."
5,A Real Page Turner,"My wife had purchased this book, and I don't normally read romantic comedies, but she liked it so well, I thought I'd give it a try. I picked this book up and didn't put it down until I was finished. It keeps you interested in what's going to happen next from the very start and is pretty funny and right-on about women in their 30's. I recommend it to both guys and girls!"
5,Great Book to Lose Yourself In!,"""Chasing Horses"" is funny, sad, romantic, and suspenseful. The characters, especially Ricki and Charlie, are zany and fun to read. The dialogue is great. WAR is the best - I love the vigilante group and the hilarious situations they get into, especially the one with the drug dealer. In my 30's, I could identify with a lot of the issues Ricki faces in this book. A great effort by this first-time author, and I'm hopeful she brings these characters (and WAR) back."
4,Well Worth The Money,"Good camera. Does everything according to what you would expect in a digital camera. Optics and final product are close the SLR quality. Only drawback is the flash. I bought an external flash using the hotshoe and the quality of inside flash photography went up a 100%. Good entry level Digital camera. Read the directions if you are not up on how digital cameras work. lots of capacity for direct control of the photos, but for entry level users, the auto feature will give you very acceptable pictures throughout the range of ordinary snap-shot photography.If you want more, take a digital photography course and use this camera, or just buy a book and start experimenting. This camera will take you through all the levels up to just short of professional."
2,Good for a while...,"I had this camera for about 2 years. It was great for most of that time... nice pictures, good video quality. It was best for pictures done in natural light. My nature shots were great! But, recently, I started getting a line down the center of every single picture, no matter which mode I shoot in, or where I shoot. I asked a camera repair shop what happened, and they said that the sensor needs to be remapped and that would be $200. :( One guy told me that this happens a lot with Fujifilm cameras and he recommended a Nikon of the same type/price range, instead. So, it's nice for a while, but once it breaks (and I didn't even do anything wrong to the camera), it's a pretty heft price to repair it."
2,worst camera I've ever had,"I bought this camera in february, and after taking 6 shots the camera almost died, I could review the photos I had taken, but when switched the dial to take photos the camera turned out black either the LCD/EFV, and only turned off when I removed batteries, I sent it to Fuji repair center, and got it back again almost one month later. then six months later the camera did exactly same thing, I haven't received my camera back yet, But I'm sure never will buy a Fuji camera again and of course my camera will died again in the next months after I get from the repair center and at the end of the day I will have wasted almost 500 dlls."
4,Difficult subject,"I have been using this book now for about 2 months. It does do a fairly good job at describing rheology and its mathematics. I would recommend a strong base in differential equations as most of the problems are solved using diffy-q. Compared to some other books this book is relatively descriptive. The questions in the book are hard to solve, but some of the questions are addressed in other text books. Rheology is a difficult subject, so more examples would be better. Overall however this book is good."
3,Pretty fair meter case,"I would have given it 5 stars if it had a little padding, but it's still worth the price. It fits my meter like a glove and has room for extra leads and small accessories. If you're looking for a plain soft case for your meter, I can recommend this one."
5,repeat buyer,"I've purchased several of these toys. I stumbled upon it while looking for something for my 2 yr old grand daughter when she had some minor surgery. She has spent hours playing with it. It was also enjoyed by her sister then four. Now, 2 yrs later, she's still playing with it."
4,Difficult to retell story,I purchased this item to use with my 0-3 Early Intervention clients. They are very attracted to it and love the locks and keys. I like that the key color matches the house. I wanted to use it to tell the story with the manipulatives so eventually they could reenact it. It is very difficult to do because there is no mother pig. In regard to durability I have had the doors fall off but so far they have snapped right back into place. Ultimately when allowed to interact with the toy the children most like using the houses for individual doghouses. They also like to drop the pigs and wolf down the chimney of the larger house.
2,Doors Fall Off,Unfortunately I did not read the reviews before buying this toy ... Indeed the doors fall off the houses. This toy is very flimsy and not made well. The doors came off the same day we gave it to her on Christmas morning. LAME!
1,Bad stuff,"I am a great fan of Dal Makhani and would rate the stuff among my favorite choices when dining at an Indian restaurant. As a great fan of Indian food, I was excited to learn that Amazon carried several brands of dal and ordered a case. Sorry to say this particular brand is hard to eat, very much like a thick paste (is it really food?). My wife and daughter, who generally like Indian food cannot stand this stuff either. I will be donating this food-like product to my local food bank, perhaps they can find someone to eat it. Amazon sells other brands of Dal Makhani (e.g., MTR) which I will continue to purchase. Sympathies to anyone who purchases this stuff."
1,Absolutely atrocious,"Ok I've had these for about a month now and oh my god are they bad. You absolutely get what you pay for and then some. I didn't have enough money to spend on a decent set so I went with these, to some extent because of the reviews that I read here. They sounded fine for a day or two but they quickly deteriorated as I listened at somewhat high volume. High volume meaning driving on the highway with windows down and being able to clearly hear the music. I don't usually write reviews but these are so bad and they broke so quickly that it's unacceptable eve for the price. Do yourself a favor and get something more decent."
5,Intimate Imagery,"Ann Beggs Davidson has a way of extrapolating feelings within us and tenderly caressing them with her intimate imagery. After reading one of her poems such as ""Enchantment"" or ""Blackout"" I am transcended to a place that has always been and yet I wonder how she took me there! I love her work and have been reading her book, ""Once There Was"" for decades. I wish I could find more books written by her! I highly recommend her work to those who enjoy simple, integral pleasures and being reminded of the core feelings we have played with since childhood."
2,Would not recommend,"Not professionally videotaped - it was done by his wife with a shaky and distracting hand held camera. Information given was very basic and related to all horses, not just gaited, as I was looking for. Gentle and humane exercises were given for all horses. Not worth the money."
2,One LUMP or Two,I don't like it because when you pour the powder into a Bottle of COLD water it turns into lumps and remains in small lumps not being dissolved into the fluid as the lemonade or raspberry drink mix. Pass on it get another flavor that does dissolve and tastes good. Maybe it will dissolve in warm water but I like my drinks cold on a warm day. I pay $1.00 for a box of 8 Packets in a local Houston grocery store. They do sell out fast.
4,Way cooler than my old Mousetrap,"This version of the old Mousetrap game is way cooler than my old one from the 70s. However, the rules for this version are a bit complicated, and it also tends to take a looooong time (because of said rules) to play and win the game. Still, the gizmos are awesome."
5,Fantastic military romance.,"Cindy Gerard is hands-down the best military romance writer out there. She brings an edge of realism to her stories that put her ahead of most other writers in the genre.Just before Darcy is kidnapped in the Philippines, she leaves a desperate phone message for her ex-husband, Ethan. This is a second chance at love story at its best.Ethan is a dream - flawed and real and a man - not some idealised woman's version of a man. Darcy is great - strong without turning into the stereotypical She-Ra that is so common in this genre these days. Their reunion story is moving, and the parts of the book in the past are as powerful as those in the present. Gerard handled this so well. I wanted to read more about them!In addition to this we get to see characters who star in past and future books. In particular we meet Amy - who is also kidnapped in the Philippines. Her growing connection with Dallas is as powerful as the main relationship.This is a book I have read more than once."
2,disappoinment,"expected a good comedy, but the movie fell short of my expectations. A good premise developed poorly. Not as funny as it could be.Some witty dialogue (the description of what a fence is) the majority was rather lame and not funny.Would not recommend."
1,"""Turn Off The Darkness"", indeed. Start by throwing this in the wastebasket.","Well, he sure didn't pick a good title. Religion, fundamentalist / evangelical / backward thought in particular IS the darkness. This fellow is the CEO of a religion channel. I cannot tell you how completely and totally bizarre an experience it is to watch mindless garbage like INSP or TBN. It is voyeurism. It is open display of mental sickness, distributed to thousands of viewers. It is uncomfortable to watch, yet, like a horrific scene of tragedy, you cannot turn away. The compulsion to see actual people regressing to a state of infantilist dependency on a ""God"" or his ""son"" cannot be denied. Unfortunately, there are too many people whose minds are so unquestioningly pliant, that this insanity and its mode of delivery is rendered ""legitimate"", all because it IS available to see. Religious programming IS the darkness, the trojan horse, seeking to infiltrate otherwise potentially healthy minds."
1,hard to read,"Reading this book was like pulling my own teeth with a pickax. For someone who claims to have a high IQ, Mr. loftus tends to ramble and rehashes time worn arguments against Christianity. The print is microscopic and the book as a whole needs some serious editing. Save your money and buy ""Letters to the earth"" by Mark Twain. Its cheaper and far more entertaining."
3,cross classic century 10 comments,"The cross pen I ordered was easy to order & was a GREAT price. I amstarting to use Amazon more often. This is after a friend referred meto this site. Their was only two dis-appointing problems when Ireceived my new pen. 1. It was made in CHINA. My old pen was madein the U.S.A.! 2. The quality was not as good, plus the weight ofthe pen was much lighter. Even though, I am glad I have it. I amlike other people who have lost their pens! I wish the website wouldhave mentioned the CHINA part! I should have read the reviews first."
2,Disappointing Pinball,"No one expects the feel of real pinball or even computer pinball with a unit like this, but this electronic game was a disappointment. The loud vibration keeps going on so long each time that it doesn't seem to have any real correlation with what set it off. The vibration seems to serve no useful purpose other than irritation, but there's no way to turn it off. The flippers get stuck frequently (there are upper and lower flippers) and is frustrating because you keep pushing the button, but the flipper doesn't move until after the ball is lost. I'd find another electronic handheld game if I were you."

2,Both dimished by half,"Bloodless bland facial expressions and body language as accompaniment to deliberately emotional full-body singing is a disconnect I don't find appealing. Just letting your mouth hang open as long as a note is held does not convey the fire or the ice of the musical content and intent. Yikes. This is painful to watch when these two genres -- Italian opera and German dramatic play -- are mixed, but never really blended. I'd rather watch a too-old Sutherland and an un-English Pavarotti impersonating their characters through music than watch actors impersonate characters while impersonating singers.It all comes across hollow/empty/fake/contrived to this viewer/listener. This is a hybrid that thankfully cannot reproduce itself."
2,I'm afraid it's not going to work.,"This is not going to work, not even foor opera fans. This is a play done with real settings, yet with a lot of dialogues and suddenly the actor/actress sing an operatic aria and then cut short and then another scene...Sutherland and Pavorotti singing was not as good as one would expect-- we can't see their acting, and nd the sound is not so good in any event. The costume is, however, very good, so is the photography. Acting is not bad. But where is the drama,the climax or anti-climax...It's the form it takes that causes the audience most trouble.One would accept an opera with real setting like Onegin with music written by Tsaichovsky etc more readily."
1,Not what I expected,The description of the item was a 5 x 7 frame with a picture of the frame with a 5 x 7 photo inserted. The frame came with a 5 x 7 matte for a 4 x 6 photo.
1,BORING!,"This book was so dull! The only book worse than this is Everything Changes, which was twice as boring as this one! Sam, Charlie, and Kristy go to father's wedding and meet new stepmom, blah blah blah. The series is supposedly ""more mature"" than the old BSC, but it's the same as the old BSC only it's extremely boring! Boring, boring, boring!"
1,Very dull,"I was expecting a much better series. Instead it was a book filled with nothing but Kristy. Which included a very dull story line too. Halfway through the book, I started skimming the rest quickly because I got so bored with the story.I loved the old books - especially how every member was mentioned at least once. I don't like how each book only focuses on one or two members. Plus these new ones seem really shallow and poorly written."
3,The Year of Magical Thinking,"A funny thing happened to me during this transaction. The book that I received wasn't this one but an Encyclopedia on Wine (coffee table book). I contacted the seller, who was so apologetic and nice and after a good laugh, I shipped the Wine book to her customer in San Francisco. She then sent me Joan Didion's Democracy, which I purchased for my widower brother for Christmas. I believe things happen for a reason, and maybe this title would have made him a little depressed. So thanks, Alice (my book fairy-godmother)and I wish you success in the New Year.Bonnie"
2,Not what I expected.,"I was disappointed in the book. It is a well written biography of her life after the husbands death but I purchased 2 copies to give as gifts to relatives who lost a son in Iraq. I thought it would help them understand the emotional roller coaster ride they're experiencing. After reading the book myself, it's more about her appointment schedule and social engagements than about the grief process, even though the author was grieving. It's strickly written as a documentary of her life events."
2,the sheltered woman,"There is no doubt that Didion is a great writer. She displays it here as well but it seems that what she might have viewed as magical thinking might come off as more like the exclusive guide to mourning. Her memories are so chock full of exotic locations, expensive hotels and restaurants, that it makes it hard to actually feel for her as she was obviously going through such a traumatic time in her life.Also I found that she never let us know Quintana. Her memories were not enlightening nor did they give us any window into their relationship. There is no doubt of her love but what did Quintana feel?I am really surprised this book has been so well received. Beyond her world of the literati and the L.A. glitterati, who can relate?"
5,The Shocking Truth of Death,"I have read almost every book out there on grief and this is the only one that captures the brutal pain, desolation and despair of loosing the love of your life.Beautifully written, insane at times but always honest raw and true.Take care reading if you are in tune with your feelings and if you don't appreciate then be thankful that you have never experienced the pain and desolation of grief."
5,Highly recommended,"In audiobooks, everything is in the reading. Barbara Caruso does a truly wonderful job - the reading is quite touching."
3,"I agree with ""cool and slightly aloof""","The person from Maine who described the narrative as ""cool and slightly aloof"" is spot on. I think all the hoopla about this book was due to Didion's considerable connections, the literati whose names she drops throughout the book as she intellectualizes the process of losing her husband and dealing with the added horror of a gravely ill daughter. Her style is so detached, so clinical, that I can't imagine her really feeling anything. Even the photo on the jacket is odd, suggesting more observation than connection. I read her many years ago in college (Slouching....) and this book did make me want to go back to reconsider her past works . But ""heart-rendering [sic}""? I don't think so.Having said this, we all ""process"" loss in our own way, and I may have to think more about this and re-read some passages. Still, this book was disappointing."
5,Just a personal record of grief,"I don't think Ms Didion intended this as a roadmap for dealing with grief; just a very personal record of how she dealt with it. I recently lost my wonderful mother, and maybe that explains why I found it engrossing. I just couldn't put it down. I read it in one sitting; then reread it more slowly. She articulated the grieving process in a way that few people could."
1,Couldn't finish the book...,Let me start off by saying that I read 2-3 books a week. This book was the 2nd book in 10 years that I have given up on. I got a few chapters in and was so bored. I couldn't get past all the references and citing every other sentence. I couldn't focus on the story and found myself reading the same paragraph over and over. Believe me I tried. I don't give up lightly when it comes to reading but this one I just couldn't finish.
3,A Journal of Grief,"I probably don't need to write a review for this book, but I did want to put my opinion out there.I wanted to read Joan Didion because of her reputation and this was the most readily available book. I have read a few of her individual essays but this was first exposure to a full length work by Ms. Didion. The writing in all of her work is strong. This book, however, seems almost to be missing something.With that being said, what a terribly hard topic to write about and still write well? I would still recommend this to anyone dealing with the loss of someone close to you, but I think there is other work by Joan Didion that is a better example of her expertise."
1,Too old fashioned,"I couldn't get through it. It starts on the night they had dinner: she made the fire, she set the table, she prepared dinner, she mixed the salad, she got him a scotch, she got him another scotch. Is this from another era? When she quoted etiquette from 1922 it seemed appropriate, although that actually was kind of interesting. Then she said she often got the same grief stricken feeling on those days she woke up after they had a fight. It's just too old fashioned for me, wanting to please her husband so much."
3,"Good intellectually, but poor sensually","I read this intellectual explanation of Ms. Didion's tragic year of family death and catastrophic illness in one sitting a few days ago. After digesting her theme and reviewing my reactions to her very difficult mourning process, I was struck at her almost total lack of sensual memory (perhaps a: ""I remember the touch of his hand on my shoulder""). Now, I can certainly respect and accept her insistence on keeping her relationship and memories private; but, since she went public with her intellectual grieving, I couldn't help wondering what happened to her sense of close physical loss? The lack of sensual balance makes her grief memoir somewhat dry.We feel her loss and fear for her daughter through her words but we are left with a need for her feelings and needs as well."
1,I think I missed something.,"I couldn't wait to get to the end of this book. Not because I liked it, I kept thinking I was going to feel something or learn something about dealing with grief and mourning. There were a few interesting things, but way too much of quoting other people's work. Very disappointed. I am an avid reader, at least two books a month and this has to be the worst I've read this year."
2,Dry & self- centered with lots of name dropping,"I am 3/4 way through this book and I simply cannot read another word. The author is an uber-rich, egomaniacal, self professed know-it-all that thinks by reading a few text books she's an expert on everything. How insulting to the staff of UCLA that took care of her daughter. I'm sure she is on their list of the top 10 most annoying clients ever. The book is touching in parts but reads like a well researched scientific paper, not a novel. And what happened to her daughter's poor husband?! It sounds as though she barged in and took over, leaving him out in the cold. For the most part I felt this book was more about her lavish lifestyle and powerful connections rather than a soulful exploration of grief. I certainly do not recommend this book."
1,"As private journal, yes...published book? NO","Obviously, a writer with Didion's track record would have NO trouble getting whatever she tapped out published instantly, however unworthy of putting between two hard covers. Casting about for the *mot juste* adjective to describe this narrative, I kept coming up with ""discursive."" Didion rambled so annoyingly that it was hard to feel any pity for her loss. It was as if she were drunk-dialling on paper! Perhaps it did her good, sped her healing, to write all this, but at the end of the day, I didn't feel enriched for having read it. And, frankly, much of it was that deadliest of sins: BORING."
1,disappointing,"I was disappointed. I'm a hospice volunteer and didn't find much in this book to help. I already know that the first year after the loss is the worst. Her being totally unprepared seemed ridiculous considering all the heart problems her husband had. It was all about her. She didn't tell us how she and her daughter worked together in their grief. She never said more about her daughter's recovery in New York. I was confused about the daughter. One section talked about adoption but it sounded like she was their biological child. Of course, they're not the average family - living in the Beverly Wilshire is not the norm.I haven't read any of Joan Didion's other books but may check them out. Are they all this self-absorbed?"
1,Required for school,Went on and on and I am sure served its purpose for the author but I really kept waiting for her to get to the point. Read 4 chapters and not sure I could take another one.
1,Steam of consciousness writing,"Disclosure: I listened to this as an audio book. Also, I could not finish listening to this book. I listened to 1 out of the 4 CDs that make up this book.First, let me say that the actress reading the book was a really good reader. I had no problems with her reading rate or voice quality.I just could not follow this book. It sounded like a stream of consciousness writing that ended up being one giant run on sentence. The first CD was all about her husband passing and everything she was thinking after that. I was waiting to hear about her daughter as well, for the story to be about the time after his passing and how she got through it with her daughter. I heard virtually nothing about her daughter in the first CD - the first 25% of the book.Please don't think me heartless or unsympathetic, I just did not enjoy the writing style of this book and could never figure out where she was or what she was talking about."
4,"Moving, but not what I wanted from Didion","This book is simply put, a moving, emotional memory dedicated to her husband. Although she writes eloquently, I found that I was wondering what was beneath the surface- i felt like she was writing words- not describing feelings, which is more of her typical style. perhaps this is because she is better and analyzing others and painting portraits with words, more so than her self-portrait. Didion tries to put her grief into words, yet she did not write this immediately after John's death, which is why this piece is lacking-- the daily change of tone and emotion that encompasses the grieving. I feel it would have been much more captivating if it was written with that raw emotion."
1,Not much about grief,"This book was more about the author's travels, friends, (Name dropping) and their well-to-do life than anything helpful regarding how to deal with death."
2,Emotionally distant,"I was disappointed with this book. I was hoping for some wisdom or insight from a gifted writer who has just experienced an incredibly painful thing but felt like she was an observer and not a participant. As a friend of mine said, ""she doesn't leave anything of herself on the page"".Part of me wonders if she wrote it too soon--how can you know how any part of losing your husband of 40 years feels after one year?"
3,WHY,"In her essay ""After Henry,"" Didion made the observation that ""writers are always selling someone out."" Given the delicate nature of The Year of Magical Thinking, I wouldn't want to suggest Didion was selling herself out by having the book published. I am just perplexed as to why she would make public such a personal chapter in her life. I can certainly understand her need to write about this experience, but why publish it for public consumption? This decision is, dare I say it, such a Jerry Springer thing to do. Can nothing be left sacred and private. Didion's experience is now just a commodity, subject to what is just useless commentary, my own included."
2,"Tiresome, tedious, and self-absorbed","I got pretty tired of this book fairly quickly. I can understand her need to work through these issues, but I'm not sure it should have been published. If she had been anyone else--i.e., not a famous author--it would have been her private journal and no one other than her therapist would have to read it. In any case, I didn't finish the book."
2,Why the music?,"I find some parts of Didion's book very relatable, at least when she's exploring her feelings of shock, the superstitious feelings, and the obsessive re-living of her husband's last few days and death. But these sections become less and less frequent as the book continues, and it all seems to devolve.But pertaining to the audiobook: What is with the music they insist on playing in the ""background"" at the end of sections? The first time it came on, I took out my earphones to see if someone in my office was inexplicably blaring piano solos. It's weird and invasive and distracts from the reading."
4,The Year of Magical Thinking,"I bought this book for a friend who recently becoame a widow, and decided to read it before I gave it to her It was filled with great stories, and was very poignant."
3,"Honestly told, but...","As have most people, I have experienced the loss of very important people. From that perspective I can say this book rings true as a bell. It contains some verbalization of insights new to me, but which feel very ""right."" My problem in reading the book was that I found myself unable to like the author. I was able to relate to the circumstances and insights, sympathetic to her situation, but unable to be sympathetic to her for some reason. It is hard to like a book when you conclude you would not want to be stuck spending time alone with the author... I might suggest this book to someone adrift after a similar loss as it would demonstrate others have been there and survived and gone on, but I am not looking to read anything else by this author."
3,The Year of Magical Thinking,I'm sorry for the author's losses - I bought the book because my 96 year old mother died and her 83 year old sister (the last of 7)lost her last brother and her last sister within 3 weeks time. I thought I could get a handle on my aunt's depression. Facing dying is different for all of us - I felt no concilliation in reading this book. I felt sorry for the author.
1,narcissism at its finest,"Two people die the author's husband and her daughter. She says they matter, but all we hear about is the author. And the author has nothing to say, seems to be surprised that death is hard and has emotions attached to it. Her writing is dull, her thoughts duller. Reverent silence would have been appropriate."
2,not all that,"Twice now I have tried to get into this book, and both times I put it down. I have endured way too much death and grief in my own life, and also am a grief therapist. I found Ms. Didion's writings to be devoid of emotion, very bland, very matter of fact. Yes i understand all the parameters around grief, we all deal differently etc..but I expected more. I have read at least a couple of hundred books on loss, grief and death, and this one left me wanting the old ones. Very disappointed."
2,What an idiot!,I read this book for a presentation I had to give at work a few months back. There is no doubt some very useful material in here. The reason why I gave it two stars is that the author is extremely biggoted. The second reason I gave it only two stars is the author is too much of a freaking idiot to understand the Christianity that he was born into.The Idiot's franchise should have given the topic of Islam to an intelligent writer who wasn't a biggot.
2,May cause offense,"The author of this book is fierce defensive about his faith. In certain areas his writings is downright offensive and insensitive to other religions or even to moderate muslims themselves.For example, not only he stop short of critcizing the Taliban for their barbaric act of demolishing the Buddha statue in Afghanistan; he even call that a 'merit' and praise their motivation as sincere!The author is also trying very hard to justify and rationalize the actions of islamic terrorists from the Taliban, Khomeni's Iran, Palestine, Chechnya and Philippines etc. When justification becomes too awkward, the author merely turn the table around and point that other people also commited their share of atrocities!I woold suggest a much more moderate book ""Islam for Dummies"" by Prof Malcolm Clark. At the very least, the author has no hidden political agenda."
5,Do your-self a favor. READ IT,"This book describes the teatching of the Coran, a book for all the humanities. As one should not judge the bible by the wrong doing of christian, This apply also to muslim. Some so-called muslims are not following the coran teatchings. One would do himself a favor and read it."
2,Disappointed,I checked this book out of the library and never finished reading it. I am glad it was a library book and not a private purchase. I was enthusiastic when I first started reading it but became disillusioned shortly thereafter. The author makes to many negative comparisons to Christianity and Judaism and I feel is not giving the straight facts on Islam.
1,such love,"If you want to understand the author, Yahiya Emerick, read his essay entitled ""Survival of the Fittest"" at this link: [...]. It is an apocalyptic, paranoid advocacy that American Muslims should mobilize into militas in which martial arts and riflery training are mandatory because when American society collapses Muslims can expect bloodthirsty Christians to attack them. This essay provides a clearer window into Emerick's thinking than does the Idiot's Guide, which is a relatively demure apology for, and misrepresentation of, Islamic extremism."
1,I'm disappointed!,"The locking fuel door is both attractive and functional. It really dresses up my truck and keeps casual fuel thieves at bay. With the price of fuel skyrocketing, it's a must have item.I've had the fuel door on my truck for a few months now and it has corroded badly. The chrome surface is covered with pits. I won't be purchasing anymore item from this supplier."
2,Very poorly made product,"there was a piece missing from the parts that should be ""included"" in the set.It was the padding part you put inside, so now , even with professional installing, half of the chrome fuel door is bulged out.There is no latch on the inside for the fuel cover to attach to the fuel cap.VERY tough installation, you need like 10 tools for it.Wish I never bought this item."
1,This is the worst investment I have done on HP hardware and any speakers,"This gives hopeless bass and worst clarity in the sound, when I checked the frequency response range from the OEM manufacturer (Micro Innovations) they couldn't answer the question.Such a waste of money and never buy this for the fancy description. Most of the notebook built in speakers will give you the same or better sound.I regret for the money I spent on this."
1,The worst speakers ever!,"Don't waste your money on these. HP should be ashamed for even bringing out such a low quality (and extremely over priced for what it is) set of speakers. I had a ""close and play"", as a kid, that delivered better stereo sound than this piece of junk. Don't get ripped off like I was. Do not buy these!"
1,Ingredient,"I'm sure it would have been a great product, Read about magnesium stearate prefer a product that does'nt have stearate."
1,Tough on my system,"I tried Devil's Claw for two days and could go no further. I was hoping for arthritis relief, but it was hard on my stomach, painful in the digestive track and triggered a migraine. I haven't had a migraine in 20 yrs. Everyone is different. I wanted this to work, it just didn't for me."
1,hate isn't good enough,This movie was soooooo awful and the pitiful attempt to be blair witch was sickening. Maybe come up with something original.
5,Hungry For a Great Read???,This book was one of the best reads I have had in a while. Postupack uses a vast array of literary knowledge to incorporate his characters into an exciting and dramatic plot. I couldn't put the book down! Enjoy!
1,Good text but non functional database script,This book's usefulness is marred by the erroneous and incomplete database script for the sample site. Looks like authors did not test the source code they have provided for readers to download.I am really disappointed. I had purchased the book because of the case study approach but without a working database I am unable to implement/modify/build upon some of the good techiniques authors discuss in the book.If any of the authors read this review please post the corrected database scripts plus script to load sample data.
2,Code doesnt work!!!,"I bought this book also for its case-study approach. At first glance, it appears very useful but when you actually try to work with the source code, it has major problems. I guess it still has some value because you can kind of go through the code, but it irks me that they do not provide a working example. It appears to me that the code was written with the beta version of .net which is all fine and dandy, but they really should post a working version of the code... I am attempting to get the code to work, so I guess about the only positive thing you can say is its giving me much experience debugging... But to me there are an unacceptable amount of errors in the source code, stuff thats just way out in left field.I emailed the authors and I got a response saying that they have a ""working version "" of the code and expected to be posting the code on the internet ""soon""...Hmm..."
3,Pretty intense and short,"This book is pretty hard, as the description days. You have to be pretty good with .NET, too, because it's short book and focuses just on doing e-commerce. I thought it left a lot of loose ends, but that may just be because they only wanted to cover the e-commerce stuff all by itself."
1,FAIL,LOOKING AT THE IMAGE AND KNOWING ITS MICROSUEDE URGED ME TO PURCHASE THIS COMFORTER BUT THE MAJOR PROBLEM IS FEATHERS KEEP COMING OUT OF IT I CAN PROBABLY FILL UP A COFFEE MUG OF FEATHERS IN JUST A WEEK OF USING THIS COMFORTER SELLER SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF SEALING THE INSIDE REALLY GOOD OR EVEN TRYING THESE BEFORE SELLING 2 THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS IM GUESSING IN A MONTH THIS COMFORTER WOULD BE FEATHERLESS
3,Microsuede is great,But the feathers poking out is not. It is my first feather comforter so I didn't know that would happen. I gave it away.
2,Not impressed,This Comforter is very very thin. A few feathers have already started falling out after a month. The color is great...just as it looks.
3,"Warm, but it's like having a pet parakeet.","It's a nice product, but feathers keep coming out and go all over the place. It makes too much of a mess that we don't use it any longer. If you don't mind feathers, then give it a try."
2,King is way too small,"This thing is way too small for my king size mattress. It barely covers the top part of the mattress, much less hanging over the sides, so I will be returning it."
2,Not what I thought!,"The price was great, but other than that it wasn't at all what I thought I would be getting.The quality is not great. Very thin, thin comforter for feather down. Disappointed for sure."
3,Has pros and cons,"The comforter is very ""comfy"" and the color is beautiful. However, its feather stuffing constantly finds its way out. I'm finding feathers everywhere! Hopefully the ""shedding"" will calm down eventually. Until then I can't say whether the comfort and color outweigh the feathery mess."
2,prickly down comforter,"This comforter is warm if you can get past the feathers jabbing you in the neck, arm, rear end and falling out everywhere. sharp tips to the feathers that seem to just fall out thru the material..constantly picking up feathers off the floor. WOULD NOT BUY THIS AGAIN! And to top it off........IT IS NOISY. must have used outside feathers and not down...would not recommend this comforter"
2,Terrible!!!,"Took one wash before the feathers were poking out everywhere and it STUNK like wet dog for weeks (plural). Needless to say, I donated this to a homeless man. Just a terrible product overall"
2,looks and feels good but to thin,"This is a nice looking comforter, however, it lacks in the filling. The comforter is thin in most areas so it is not as warm as it could have been.To bad they skimped on the filling."
2,Microsuede Down/Feather Comforter,"I read the reviews and still bought this comforter set. At my age I could surely take care of a little static and loose feathers...! This comforter has its own power source! I have used 2 cans of anti-static spray and a bottle of fabric softener/water mix and still have trouble getting out of bed in the morning-I'm stuck to it. The dogs fear their morning greeting. I believe it's a combination of my hair standing on end, the dozens on feathers stuck about my body and my newly obtained super power to shoot lightening bolts. I also believe the nightmares of aliens with probes are directly associated with all the loose, piercing feathers...I gave this 2 stars because 1. it is warm & 2. the manufacture's ingenious ability to continue selling this product after reviews like mine and yours."
2,"Feathers everywhere, but warm","I'm not really a picky consumer, but the feathers that leak out of this are a nuisance. At first I thought that it would get better after it was ""broken in,"" but after more than a year, it is still bleeding feathers.But it is a beautiful color, and is incredibly warm to boot."
1,Save your money!,"Microsuede Down/Feather Full/Queen Comforter Set, CamelI bought this about 9 months ago for $35 when it was on sale. At first I was really impressed with the comforter. The cover of the comforter (microsuede side)felt wonderful and it kept me plenty warm. After a bit of use and washings I noticed more and more feathers escaping right through the fabric side (no holes just right through the fabric). Also my comforter only has X's and doesn't have the full sewn boxes like more expensive models to keep the down in place so the down and feathers end up in the edges of the comforter while you lay under the middle. I would recommend you save your money and buy a better comforter. Personally I'm tired of having to pluck myself each morning so into the trash this one will go."
1,Sleep in a bird nest...Seriously.,"Great price, great colors.But you'd be more comfortable actually sleeping in a real bird nest, complete with sticks and branches as well as feathers. This comforter had the feathers sticking out everywhere, pokey and painful and gross. No possible comfortable position unless you sleep on it upside down."
2,THE WITCHES OF EASTWICK,"We bought this comforter because it was beautifull and a great price. I've had down blankets before, and i expect some feathers. But this is ridiculous!!! mY whole house looks like a scene from WITCHES OF EASTWICK. Feathers constantly come out, a few handfulls a day. it is beautifull, and warm & cozy. I loved it other than the embarrasement of having to pluck feathers off everything I own. I have ordered a duvet cover, but I doubt that will help much...dont waste your money."
3,horrible. feathers everywhere the first day and on,what a horrible item. opened the bag and feathers started comming out everywheres. no holes either. it continually got worse. feathers all the house.no kids either. horrible purchase.
2,Not as Nice as it Looks!,"This comforter is made pretty poor. You get what you pay for, I can see why it is marked down so much. One side is ""softer"" while the other is stiff and ""crunchy"". Not comfortable at all. I decided to use it for the warmth factor and actually have the ""sueded"" side facing down because the opposite stiffer side doesn't feel very good against your skin. Therfore I have a quilt on top of it. The tags read ""dry clean only"". I know as a fact I wouldn't go to the expense to have it cleaned that way as the set is not worth it. It does have a decent weight to it, but other than that, if I had actually seen this at a store for sale, I wouldn't of purchased it, even at the low price."
1,cheap,the product that I received is very poor in quality. After only having it for a few weeks the comforter began to shed feathers daily all over the bed. It is so bad that u can literally feel the feathers sticking you when you lying down I have pulled out over 30 feathers during these last few weeks and definitely think this is a total waste of my $50.
2,Feathers come out!!,"I had a really great Nautica down comforter for years that never, ever shed. I had a pen leak on that one and bought this as a cheap replacement. You definitely get what you pay for. This comforter sheds feathers like crazy. I'm constantly vacuuming and finding feathers on clothes. This purchase was NOT worth the money."
2,Washable???,"I purchased this item at more than I see others paid for, and one reason I bought it was that it says.......""machine washable"" I just opened it up, and the first thing I see is ""dry-clean only"" Wow, whats the deal? I feel cheated. I do not do 'dry cleaning' .............and now I'm seeing a lot of complaints about the feathers poking through. Sigh."
1,microsuede comforter? - not a great idea,"What was I thinking when I ordered a microsuede comforter? I think I was thinking affordable down comforter and blanked everything else out. It came with two microsuede pillow cases, yet, which will see the donation box before they see my head upon them. The underside of the comforter is a weird material that makes a swooshing noise. I've been using it for two weeks and it's already losing feathers. But the very worst feature that I didn't know before purchase is that it requires dry cleaning. If only I hadn't used it right away, I would return it. Why why why did I have to use it at all? Be warned. Unless you like sleeping with suede."
5,Microwsuede Comforter,Son was happy with Christmas present. I was happy with quality and speed of shipment especially.
2,Looks are deceiving,"microsuede down/feather full/queen comforterlooks are deceiving in this good feeling comforter. i've used it for two weeks now, and already the pointy edges of the feathers are sticking through and poking me! there are feathers on the floor, and on everything I wear when I sit down on the bed. the warmth and weight of this comforter are great --- but get a duvet cover to keep the feathers inside!"
3,Ugly Beauty,"Howler monkeys have an unpleasant guttural bark which sounds like a cross between an attack dog and a chainsaw. Some of the other primates in the Caratinga Biological Station in eastern Brazil sound like oversize squirrels, angry piglets or sped-up donkeys.To be blunt, none of them sound very pleasant.This CD consists of nine tracks, most in the 7-12 minute range. The longest track documents the approach of a violent thunderstorm and subsequent drenching rain, captured in stunning digital fidelity.There's no denying that these recordings are very well done, with lots of 3-dimensional background detail, variety, high fidelity and low noise. It's too bad the sounds, amazing as they are, have all the appeal of a rusty chainsaw."
2,"The Twilight of Christianity, Judeism, et. al.","This guy is no Fundy (a ""reformed"" atheist, though), but there is so much wrong with this book, I can't begin to explain. It's not terribly written (just terribly edited), but just look at his central thesis: the facts show that the actual numbers of atheists (WORLDwide) has been at most steady, and will likely remain so. It's actually Christianity and Judaism that's on the decline (http://www.gem-werc.org/mmrc/mmrc9805.htm; http://www.adherents.com/Na/Na_42.html, etc.)He uses false premises, flawed logic, and focuses on the wrong ideas. He doesn't even actually get to his main point, only, it seems, what he hopes for.This guy is smart, quite knowledgeable, and the book may be worth a read (for some historical context or maybe just to challenge your critical thinking skills); just look at the stats and the reality on the ground, and judge for yourself how off the mark he is on this one."
2,An OK MP3 Player,"I had higher expectations of this MP3 Player. The viewable screen for the songs doesn't show much at all so I had to rename all my songs. You annot scroll to another song while a song is playing. The software that works with the Player doesn't work, at all. When the battery is starting to run out, you finaly see a battery metter but then you have maybe 1 minute before it dies."
1,Unit failed after 2 days,"Like the reviewer before me, I found the Lyra Jukebox frequently locks up and must be reset. Too bad-it has great features, fine sound quality, incredible storage capacity and a highly intuitive software package. Since my problem was identical to that described by the other reviewer, I'd assume the lockup problem is generic and not a random failure.Unfortunately I had to send it back due to this annoying problem.I'm curious to know if anyone out there has had one of these items for a month or more and not experienced the lockup problem. Your response will tell me if I whould wait a couple of months until RCA straightens out their problem or if I should look at brand X."
3,"interesting topic, but annoyingly smug in tone at times","I agree with the earlier reviewer; her anti-American, anti-globalization messages were really irritating.I couldn't believe it when she said the name of the ""Snickers"" candy bar was the epitome of vulgar and offensive. What?! How could a candy bar name cause such ire? They're supposed to have silly names, duh. What would she say about the candy names ""milk duds"" or ""whatchamacallit""? Oh no, send out the guards! What a fuddy-duddy (sounds like a candy bar name, oops!)This was an interesting book, if a little slow and ponderous when she discussed the historical background; it took me a lot longer to read her book than other travelogues by Pete McCarthy and Bill Bryson, both of whom I vastly prefer (better books, and much more humble in attitude)."
5,"Really, really useful if you're in the field","I'm a financial engineering student at an Ivy League institution. Just got the book from Amazon. Awesome book, so far the best help in preparing for technical aspect of the ib (quantitative positions) interviews that I have encountered. I thought it would be sort of a black and white xerox copy - instead it turned out to be really well published. The book is rather weighty (>300p), contains a plethora of questions with detailed explanations, 0 filler. The guy is very good about cultivating the attitude of, ""It's the thinking process and not the number in the answer."" Overall, I would definitely recommed this. Given the amount of general info you can garner off free advice sites - vault/wetfeet, this may as well be the number one book on your preparation list."
5,Nice flag,The flag looked exactly as was advertised. Perfect fit for my yard. I would recommend it for someone with a small yard.
2,Product is cheaply made,"Thgis flag is flimsy and light. I don't care for it; howeve, the price was cheap, so I suppose it is correct for the price. You get what you pay for. I can't really complain, but I am gong to find one that is of better quality to replace thsi one."
4,Saints flag,Beautiful flag; a little disappointed that it wasn't two sided but it didn't state that it was so thats my fault. Shipping was quick and package arrived in good condition
5,Kevin Christmas Yo-Yo.,I got this for my kids for Christmas. They love it. They have not put it down. It is teaching them hand-eye coordination and a safe hobby to show thier friends.
3,string broke after several tries.,"always loved duncan yo yo's. however, the string fell off after less then ten uses.This will not stop me from buying more duncan yo yo's"
2,it was bad,The plastic was way to fajile and broke asily. Also it needs to be unscrewable so that you can fix the tangled string.
1,Awful yo-yo,"After 3 minutes the yo-yo just spins in circles and can't even perform simple sleeps. It either spins in circles when trying to go down, or stays in sleep for and won't come back up. Definitely need to get a better quality yo-yo if you want to do anything with it. At this point I can't even yo-yo without tricks and I haven't even used it for more than 5 minutes."
2,Broke after one day.,"I bought the Duncan Butterfly Yo-yo and was having a great time with it. My son is not quite old enough but he was having fun watching and puzzling over it. The very next day the string broke. The plastic is still in good shape and I could attach another, but the string should be more durable."
2,"Good for some tricks, but can't sleep","This was my first butterfly yoyo, and it's okay. It has a good feel in your hand, but it can't sleep that well. It only slept for maybe 5 sec. I didn't count. This is a fixed axle yoyo, so the axle is attached to the yoyo. A bad thing about this is that if you get a knot at the end of the string, you can't undo it without breaking your yoyo. However, this yoyo is good for tricks like around the world, and forward pass. I recommend this yoyo for first yoyoers.Pros:lightweightgood feel in handgood priceCons:doesn't sleep longcan do limited tricks"
2,Happier with Dancer's Body Advanced Workout,"Based on comments here, I purchased both BM Accelerated and BM Dancer's Body dvds. I found the instructor in Dancer's Body to be more motivating and easy to follow."
4,"Burn, Baby, Burn!","Ouch! My thighs are on fire!The directions are clear, and you don't need speacial equipments to perform the exercises which seem easy but burn every muscle of your body.I wish they would add some back exercises, more waist and abs.For beginners - try to concentrate on the pink/lavender lady. Sadly, not shown enough.All in all - a great way to start the day!I will definitely purchase other Bar Method DVDs."
3,Good for Beginners,"I'm a personal trainer and group fitness instructor--I teach Pilates, HiiT workouts, Cycling and yoga...and I feel that this barre workout is a little too easy for those who've done much barre training or Pilates. I never felt the burn (or any type of soreness after the workouts)...but it is a good workout if you're just getting into barre workouts. She isn't annoying, she's clear with her directions and all the moves are pretty simple and straight forward."
2,miko adds points,i think miko hughes is one of the great child actors of all time. however given his acting range he should appear in better stuff than this. i thinks the movie makers thought oh well only kids will watch this and its made for video so lets not try to hard to make it good. it not terrible though is the can of thing to watch on a raniny day or when your sick.
2,Just ok,"This book was just ok, it was not what i expected at all. It was very slow and it only got somewhat interesting at the end of the book. After reading all of the reviews on this book I expected it to be much better."
5,An incredible book for all mermaid lovers,"i'm 15 years old and have always loved mermaids. My favorite movie is Disney's The Little Mermaid, and i am always interested in any books i come across about them. i came across this book in 6th grade. it was my teacher's book, but i stole it for the entire year! i read it over and over again, i was mesmerized by the stories and pictures. most of the stories i havnt even heard before. i was so sad when i had to give it back, but just now, 3 years later, i found it on this website! i ordered it right away and couldn't be happier. i reccomend this book to anyone that has a facsination with mermaids. this book is truly wonderful."
3,The Quick Internet guide to Career and Education Information,"This is an excellent reference book for any recent graduate or anyone looking to find a new job or career in this technological age. The information shared is valuable and easy to locate. I'd recommned this along with Richard Bolles work on the same subject, although I found this to be more helpful and easier to use as a reference source."
3,Two Ships in the Night,"Violinist Lisa Walker at first set out to study whale vocalizations in Alaskan waters, but soon came to value their enigmatic songs more for their artistic content than for any detached scientific interest. Combining underwater hydrophone recordings with her own new-agey violin + synthesizer tunes, she has crafted an ""interspecies ambient"" album (her term) which unfortunately emphasizes mystery over understanding.It seems like a missed opportunity to me that her music does not attempt to incorporate whalesong except as occasional backdrop. She also mentions on her website (groovedwhale.com) that she played her violin to the whales through underwater speakers and it would have been nice to know whether the humpbacks responded to this in any way.Alas, ""communication"" does not seem to have been the goal and it certainly did not emerge as a result. What we have is a rather lackluster new age album with some whale recordings in the background."
4,Great bang for the buck,"Well, I can't complain about this unit. Its cheap, the sound is fine for a portable system, and the memory is sufficient for workouts. The only problem I had was the instructions for syncing the device were incorrect, the FILE menu has the connect to device option not the other menu that the instructions said to look. It is my first MP3 player and I love it. As for the other people having problems, well, mine has worked perfectly (I love the neck strap for weight lifting, the arm straps are too constricting....feels like a blood pressure cuff!).I recommend this unit!"
2,RCA RD1060 64 MB Kazoo Digital Audio Player,If you lost a USB Connection cord for this player-- put it in trash. You will never find a replacement USB cord ever again! This is soo frustrating!!!
4,"A great player, but bad software","The player itself is very nice. It's buttons are solid, the form is easy to hold and move in your hand, and the controls are well placed and responsive. It comes with a nice pack of things, such as a neck strap, wrist strap, a set of decent batteries, and a CD with the drivers and MusicMatch software on it.That's the only bad thing. MusicMatch isn't the best program, but you have to use it. There are NO other programs that can talk to your K@zoo. Trust me, I looked all over. Nothing. You're stuck with MusicMatch. MusicMatch isn't really that bad, it's just that I really would have liked to use something else at my own option.Thumbs up never the less. It plays my mp3 and wma files for bargain basement price."
5,Great Little Player,"I've had this player for 2 yrs; I've worked out and ran with it and it's a great little player. Very reliable and has been dropped a few time without any problems. The plastic casing that ties into the armband didn't last very long, but a new neoprene case was all that's necessary. Great for the memory and price and I've added a MMC card rather than shelf it for a newer, higher MB model."
2,BEWARE! Cannot expand to 192mb as claimed!!,"I recently purchased this product, and then spent the money to get a 128mb memory to expand it to 192mb. The Kazoo, however, will not recognize larger than a 64mb card. RCA aparently is now aware of this, but they do not plan to put out any updates to fix the problem. All they did is change the specs on their site to say ""Expandable to 128mb!""....rather than 192mb.Way bumbed out, wasted money. Not cool!!"
2,Think hard before buying,"This is a great mp3 player. Use rechargeable batteries. They last a long time and they're better for the enviroment. Using rechargeables you'll save 50 times what you spend using nonrechargeable batteries. HERE""S MY ISSUE. While I had no problems using the musicmatch program, it conflicted with my other programs so that they did not work properly. When contacting customer support I was told there weren't any drivers available other that the .exe file, which is not a driver but a program, on the CD and whatever I could download from RCA's poopy site. I was also told that I would have to figure something out myself. I am considering returning it and buying a different brand because of these issues."
5,Awesome sound/so-so software on PC,"The player itself is a nifty little thing. Very comfortable. The sound is very good and the headphones are ergonomic. What was not so hot is the musicmatch software that came with it. You first need to download the plugin to the musicmatch in order to download the music to your mp3 player.Overall, I would definitely recommend this product to ppl."
3,SCARY SKEETERS,"Giant bug movies are so much fun...don't look for quality in the acting, directing, or even special effects departments. MOSQUITO is enjoyable because it is so bad, and obviously there's a definite tongue in cheek feel, and the mosquitoes are kinda scary, specially if you don't like the little critters anyway. The acting is so bad one can't help but wonder how some of these guys actually played in other movies! I didn't know until reading reviews that Gunnar Hansen was the original Leatherface, but his line concerning the chainsaw is certainly funnier knowing that!This is one of those so bad it's good flicks, but you will enjoy it if you like bug movies!"
5,Great Movie,I do not own Mosquito but I have seen it on TV and as much people think that it is a stupid movie on the other hand I think its very good. It has some good action parts. Its an old movie. 1994 but I would like to see if I get a copy on VHS or DVD. Thanks.
2,~Mosquito~,"Although I gave this movie a rating of two stars, do not let that fool you. I found this horror movie enjoyable and hillarious at times and a good movie to watch with my friends and family. Especially during Halloween parties. We decorated our home with the theme of this movie {tents, camping equipment and mosquitoes of course} and had a fanastic time. Hands down, this movie should be in the hall of fame for great movies! I am disappointed about the price of this movie, however, I have not been able to find it for sale, but $74.00 on Amazon is way too much for the movie itself. When you are ready to wipe the dust off, and come down on your price, I imagine you would not be able to keep this movie in stock. :)"
5,Best Value in Super Zoom Class,"I paid $225 out the door for this camera and it competes with cameras almost twice that price! On the automatic setting, it takes incredible photos, but has the capability to go manual if you are so inclined. For the price, there is nothing on the market that comes close. The macro on this camera is great and the close ups I have taken even on the automatic setting are unbelievable. If you are looking for something that is SLR like, but not the SLR price, this comes close. Of course, the SLR's will take better photos if you are an expert, but if you are an amateur or intermediate photographer and want something that gets the job done, put this one on your list...taking the price into consideration this thing doesnt disappoint. You will be glad you purchased this one!"
4,The perfect Digital camera for the price,I just love it and did not have to get a mortgage for it. The pictures have the high quality I was expecting and the camera is easy to operate. Thank you!
5,That 's as good as it gets.,"Reviewed most digital cameras on the market today to replace a worn Olympus. Decided that this camera fitted my needs even though I had never purchased a Fuji camera before. I bought it before I made a two-week vacation to Greece. WOW. I was stunned by the quality of my pictures. Colors were unbelievably true to nature. I love to take low level lighting pictures like at sunset, sunrise, etc. I couldn't believethe outcome. It gave me some of the most beautiful shots I have ever madewith high priced film cameras. And I did this on automatic. No more worries about f stops, speed, etc. for me."
3,Attention Tinnitus sufferers!,"This is a lovely CD but has too much music and not enough of the enchanting sounds of the Loons. The best CDs for people suffering with tinnitus are ECHOES of NATURE. No music, just sounds of nature to drown out the noise in your brain. Look them up under ""New Age"" then use the SEARCH bar."
3,The Battle of Cedar Creek and Other Details,"The Vermont Brigade takes its place alongside the Irish Brigade and the Iron Brigade as one of the celebrated Brigades of the Army of the Potomac. In this story The Vermont Brigade in the Shenandoah Valley, 1864 the Brigade's activities under the command of Union General Phil Sheridan are recounted by Aldace F. Walker an officer in the 11th Vermont (a regiment that was also designated as the 1st Vermont Heavy Artillery).The book is a reprint from a book that was scanned and many of the passages have missing letters, enough to make entire paragraphs un-readable. This flaw severely detracts from the work.Despite the flaw, two stories stand out as interest to those wanting first hand accounts of the Civil War. There is a vivid description of the agonies of a man wounded, how he is treated, nursed back to health, and ultimately long term recovery, & a detailed, brigade level account of the Battle of Cedar Creek-the decisive fray in the whole of the campaign."
5,Mysteries...solved,"Baby behavior is definitely baffling. When I was a first time parent I often looked at the mysterious little person sharing my life and wondered...why? Why is peek-a-boo so endlessly fascinating? Why does she fall apart if I leave the room even for a moment. I wish I had had this book then, because a lot of my questions are answered in it. Jennifer Margulis's voice is warm, knowledgeable, and personal. New parents will be reassured that the strange things that their babies do are not only normal, but important and meaningful. The photographs are both sweet and honest."
4,"Good Story, easy way to learn about the process of birthing",This is simple explanation of working birthing. There is no medical hype here. This is about woman and nature. There is power here. Listen.
1,"Buy a Sponge, it's a lot cheaper!","I cannot believe I fell for this product. It has slightly more tensile strength than a sponge. I was hoping to find a device to strengthen all of my fingers (having recovered from Cervical surgery), but this item is similar to what boating people sell so you can attach it to your keys to keep them afloat should you drop them in the water.I suggest that anyone considering purchasing this item, who would pay approximately $8 for the item and the same amount for shipping, save your $16, and purchase 3 different strengths of Therapy Putty. You will get much more of a workout and feel that your money was much more well spent that buying this almost useless piece of foam. The manufacture of this item should be ashamed for offering it. I wish I could give zero stars."
2,Out of date Sci-Fi,"Robert Moore Williams wrote this as a juvenile. The science was wrong when he wrote it. It is filled with incorrect assumptions and bad technology. I bought it because I collect Avalon Books, but do not recommend it for anyone else."
4,Voodoo Magic,"Was consistantly getting bad leg cramps on longer cycling/running bricks hydrating with just water and Gatorade, but changing up to Accererade on recommendation from a LBS, cramps went away and felt much better overall. Gave this particular version (Fruit Punch) 4-stars as was not as palatable as the Orange I'd first used."
3,Great drink - but messy clean up,"The functionality of this drink is great - I'm training for an Ironman and this works well on both my bikes and runs. I really like the 4:1 mix, and feel like the protein makes a difference in my long distance training. This is the only sports drink I've found with the 4:1 mix and I'm a fan. It doesn't upset my stomach (and mine is very sensitive), and has what seems to be a great mix of electrolytes.I have two main complaints about this product - the first is that it's neon green (lemon lime) and leaves horrible stains on everything from my running clothes to my white bike. It's a pain to constantly be cleaning stains from my sports drink leaking from it's bottle. It also doesn't seem to mix up very well, because there's always residue left in my bottles that has to be scrubbed out after every single use. I like the product, but not enough to spend the time it takes to clean me, my bike, and the bottle up after every use."
2,New formula,"I am not digging this new formula of Accelerade. The company patent was sold to Motts. It is way to lemon tasting. I prefer the more lime. It isn't the same at all. I'm wandering if Pacific Health is still making it, or if it's only Motts. I want the old back."
2,hard to use,"Hard to mix, doesn't like to completely dissolve, foams up and foam doesn't go away. Make this at about 2/3 (or less) recommended strength. Full strength clogs up drink valves. Won't buy again; there are too many other comperable products that are more user friendly."
5,Awesome product..tastes great too!,"This is some awesome stuff! It really hydrates. So much better than Gatorade. And the price just makes it even better. Much more affordable than other brands I've seen. I even give my kids some since they play so hard all the time and they love it. And once when they had severe diarrhea and vomiting, I gave them some of this and they felt much better in about half a day. They never would drink Pedialyte so this drink replaces that for them. That by itself deserves more than 5 stars. The mountain berry flavor also tastes much better than the fruit punch. To me anyways. Well...us. : Cannot recommend this product enough. Thanks Accelerade. And thanks Amazon."
3,"So far it does what it says, BUT.....","I got this flavor because my boyfriend said he wanted lemon lime. However, I wanted mountain berry. I opted for lemon lime to make him happy. I must be going crazy or something because the flavor is horrible. It taste like Twix cereal and a candela candle. Am I mixing it wrong or something? Someone tell me your secrets! Pretty please with some accelerade ontop! Well, I'm not throwing it out if that's what you are thinking. I'm going to pretend it's a puree of Twix and take it like a man. After a workout I feel less compelled to down lots of water. Can't speak for my boyfriend. Anyone taste the mountain berry or do all of them taste horrible?"
2,Dog training DVD Review,"This DVD is not near as helpful as ""train your dog"" which is availible on Amazon.com. The lady on the video looks like she is reading off notecards and is not a very good speaker. I think the dog was already trained also, and she didnt use a variety of dogs. The other DVD mentioned above is 100 times better. They use un trained dogs, are freidnly, and use all different breeds. The only good thing about this DVD was the menu layout. This DVD only has about 10 commands, and the other DVD has about 30."
2,Edge-of-the-chair reading,"I thoroughly enjoyed it! The author's character development is very good which is of utmost importance to me when reading fiction. The message was clear and not preachy. The action scenes were breathtaking, and made me want to hurry up to the next sequence. Good reading for those who like good thrillers without all the sex and language that usually accompany them."
4,PRETTY CUTE,"My son, who is 3 yrs old, loves the ""Max & Ruby"" tv show. He's not as interested in ""Max's New Suit,"" even though it's pretty cute (book is prob better for a younger child). His favorite books are:""Dragon Shirt""""Bunny Cakes""""Bunny Party""""Max Cleans Up""""Max's Toys"""
2,So-so,"Very presentable book with excellent color photos. The training section is also very good. The constant advertising of the Nylabone (chew toys) however, is quite irritating. Also, the book tends to generalize quite a bit and presumes that you have a puppy instead of an older dog. The health care section makes no mention of health problems specific to Schnauzers such as hip dysplasia and cysts and recommends you take your dog to the Vet for virtually every ailment. Save your money and read the internet if you want info. Or you can have my copy."
4,Helpful survival guide for new employees,"This book is perfect for new college graduates or inexperienced employees starting new jobs. Milo and Thuy Sindell provide a wealth of information about proper business conduct and etiquette, including a checklist for recommended activities during your first 12 weeks on the job. Although the material is basic and somewhat repetitive (just like a start-up job), we think the book would make a great gift for anyone who is just beginning to learn the workplace ropes."
3,Not her best effort,"I was very disappointed with this book. I loved the earlier four in the series but this is really a very short story (168 pages) followed by a cookbook.One cute item, though, was the inclusion of the typo from her Fudge Cupcake Murder."
2,This series is going downhill fast,"This book is a disappointment. The mystery is pretty lame and the constant romantic ""tension"" between Norman and Mike and Hannah is getting old.The first half of this book is the story, and the second half is recipes. I will say most of the recipes look pretty good, just be aware that if you buy this book, you are buying a cookbook with a story attached, rather than a substantial mystery with a few recipes in the back."
2,No Diana Mott Davidson,"After eight chapters of small town gossip about people I don't even want to know (and I lived in a small town for 20 years), I gave up. Any mystery writer knows that you gotta kill someone in the first couple of chapters, or you're gonna lose your audience. You also gotta have interesting characters, and Hannah, the protagonist, is so bland that she makes vanilla (my favorite flavor) seem downright spicy. I'm usually pretty patient with audio books, since they really just occupy my mind while I drive or sew or wash dishes, but this didn't even succeed at that! I might try one more, if I can find one with 5 star average reviews, but otherwise, there's plenty of better writers to read or listen to."
2,overpriced and not enough book,"I've enjoyed reading the Hannah Swensen series so far...so far being the key part of the review. This book had an abrupt ending to a lackluster mystery. What you are really buying here is the ""Lake Eden Cookbook"".I read this to keep up with the series, but really think it was over priced for what you get. I'm giving the next book a shot, but it may be the end of me reading this series of books.The love triangle is starting to anger me. Hannah has no problem stringing on 2 guys but when one of them even LOOKS like he's going to date another girl Hannah flips out and becomes a brat. Why is it OK for her to string 2 guys along, but not the other way around. Story line wise she's been doing it for a YEAR!The books started out great, but they are getting increasingly frustrating."
2,short story,"The story was okay. Not the best in the series but okay. My rating is based on the length. The book itself is very misleading. You look at it and see what appears to be a full length book. When you read it, you find a short story and a recipe book. If your going to write a short story, bill it as such or write several and publish them together. Wish I would have gone to the library for this one rather than the bookstore."
1,Disappointing!,"I have a few other books in the Hannah Swensen series, and this by far is the worst. There is not much mystery and the story just ends. You pick up the book thinking it is decently long, only to find out half is just recipes. Not sure I am going to continue to read these anymore. Very disappointing!"
1,Let's do the Time Warp again!,"--and head off to Lake Eden for a Christmas party, where the teenagers seem to be escapees from '50s-era sitcoms like ""Our Miss Brooks,"" ""Ozzie and Harriet,"" and ""Dobie Gillis.""And where the menu is taken directly from a 1950s church cookbook. I have NEVER seen so many recipes, in a single volume, calling for Campbell's soup. I fully expected to find (*gulp*) cottage cheese in the lasagna recipe, and, durn burn it, I was right!'Nuff said."
4,Sugar Bliss,Book 6 was a cute and quick read. It was nice to see some new characters added along with some of the old ones. Hannah and her sister really go all out on this one.
2,Left me feeling hungry!,"The mystery was solved too easily, with no real suspense, and half the book was recipies - dissapointing when you wanted a good read!"
2,"good book but fell apart once i opened it, the edges peeled off an it broke",The book is a great book but when i recieved the book it had book edge pieces falling off of it and the book fell apart once i started to read it.
1,Where's the beef?,"Nice book. But where is the beef? If you have Mindy Martins book you're all set and this one doesn't offer much news. Actually, it includes a chapter about the Digital Dashboard Resource Kit 2.x which is now obsolete after the release of SharePoint Portal Server."
1,poor book,"i know turbo pascal, which isn't saying much, but i'm not a total newbie to programming.This book is confusing and fails to connect the dots.The most basic of things are never explained, ever, and I would stay away from this book."
3,Okay.,"If you have his other red book or the sales bible, this one pretty much repeats the others. A few good new things in there though, not bad to have as a light read."
4,Unconventional,"I always like unconventional sales books since there is so many out there and Gitomer just delivers! Its such a fun read, simple useful and colourful. Small enough you can bring around and read whenever you are on the road, having lunch along on your sales calls. Good way to gfet yourself ready before your pitch!"
5,Photoshop Reference,"Photoshop 5 Bible, Gold Edition is a well written, easily understandable text that no serious Photoshop user should be without. The book covers all aspects of Photoshop starting with the fundamentals all the way through to digital photography and web site design. The color illustrations are very helpful. In addition, the author discusses color management in detail. I would recommend Photoshop 5 Bible, Gold Edition to any Photoshop user who wants to get the most from Photoshop and produce great digital photos."
3,Truncated Version Terrible,"I agree with the reviewer who noted that the original mini-series was more like 200 minutes long & included a lot more interesting background. I recorded the original broadcast, & was very disappointed in the abbbreviated version. Hopefully the longer version will be released on DVD before my VHS copy wears out...."
2,WOW.........,".......I felt kinda dirty or something after watching this. I do give this film 2 stars simply for what could have been. The plot was decent enough(see previous reviews) and the movie explored very basic human emotions and fears such as love, betrayal and lonliness. Unfortunately, all this goes by the wayside in favor of lots of pretty explicit sex scenes....Amane and Hanabusa, Juri and Hanabusa, Juri and Amane, Hanabusa, Juri and friend, etc. If you like lots of homosexual sex scenes then this is probably right up your.....alley. Definitely not for the traditional minded."
4,Lights Ups!,"Bought this for my 7-year old grandson for Christmas. Impressed with the easy-store case. He has many other K'nex kits, but he loves the fact that this one lights. He can numerous things with the kit. I would recommend it...however, the pieces are VERY small and not good around smaller children."
3,So-So Quality,"Yes, these DVDs are viewable in the US and are in English. They are in wide screen format and appear to have been remastered. So the quality of the picture is very good. However, I could not turn off the subtitles on 3 of the 4 movies I watched. And I tried viewing the DVD's on 3 different brands of DVD players."
2,Disappointed,"It didn't have as much useful information as I hoped, and it was more of a pet-owners' guide. Two stars."
4,Pretty good,"This book was pretty good, I got a used one for around three dollars (despite most of the used ones being sold for 50$, and the new ones 200$) and it has helped me a lot.It covers a lot of the basic pet illnesses and has a cross section at the end of each chapter that shows the causes of some sicknesses, the results, and some possible treatments. I espcially like the index that has a lot of information that you may need emergencys in bold so that you can easily locate the page if an emergency should occur ( e.g., Unconciusness, Difficulty Breathing, ect. ). In all, I would recomend this book, but I definitly wouldn't pay 200$ for it."
1,Love at first site?,"I was so excited when my hubby brought this little MP3 player home. I am an avid walker...what attracted me to the Yepp was how small and lightweight it is... unfortunately, your limited to ""yepp"" software... and it is not compatible with Windows Media Player or other cool Apps. The Yepp Software is very difficult to use... and I am a software tester."
1,Disappointing,"Do not waste your money on this. It is very outdated. They use previous videos from years back. The cover makes it look like there would be something new to it but there is not. The workout is traditional firm and if you have any of there other videos, you have what you need and will not get anything new from this."
1,Save your money,"If you have any Firm videos at all, you probably have this compilation. The cover leads you to believe it's all new stuff, but it is a compilation of all the old videos, and they are very outdated. Yet another marketing gimmick like others have used (Karen Voight) to make you think you're getting something brand new, when in reality, you probably already own it in one form or another. Disappointing and a waste of twenty bucks."
5,At Long Last,"I was beginning to think that I would be dead and buried before Sony had all eleven seasons of Married With Children out(knock on wood that I make it to October). We fans have had a long, long journey getting here. Star Trek came and went in all it's incarnations. Jessica started later and got her tenth season out prior to this (Murder She Wrote). So I am happy to be able to complete the collection with some of the best shows they did, even tho Fox had dumped them in spirit long before this and the show was beginning to show it's age. The ""Al goes to Hell"" episode with Robert Englund alone is worth the whole season. So to all of us who have been in the ""Hell-evator, going down!"", lo these many years...we finally have our floor in sight and we will at long last be in Married With Children Heaven with Buck."
2,Not effective,I like Dermologica products and usually buy them from my beautician. This was very reasonably priced compared to her prices so I decided to give it a try. I feel it is not authentic and probably harms my skin. Will buy from my usual source next time.
2,Web ignores a significant group -- Scots Irish women,"C. Kay Larson's biography Great Necessities: The Life, Times and Writings of Anna Ella Carroll 1815-94 redresses the gap, the lack of mention of women, found in Born Fighting on the Scots Irish in America. Carroll was perhaps the most prominent Scots-Irish woman of the 19th century and I'm sure there are others.Patricia Armstrong"
4,Good book,"I have yet to finish the book, but it has pulled me in quickly. Mr. Webb knows, and whats more, obviously loves his subject matter. He delves deep into the history of his people and treats what he finds with respect and a a bit of nostalgia. A solid read. For what it's worth, I recieved this very quickly, and in excellent conditon."
4,Born Fighting,The book moves along at a quick pace and is a good read. Especially to those of British descent.
4,very good,"This book is a partisan history of Scots Irish, the majority of immigrants in the 1700's, which then breaks into a personal history. I liked the way it was done, unlike some other reviewers. Let's be blunt: this book is about rednecks. Jeff Foxworthy notes that you can find rednecks all the way into Canada, they aren't limited to the South. I found it a fun read. I also likedThe Mark of the Scots: Their Astonishing Contributions to History, Science, Democracy, Literature, which balances it,How the Irish Saved Civilization (Hinges of History),How the Scots Invented the Modern World: The True Story of How Western Europe's Poorest Nation Created Our World & Everything in It, and evenHow the Irish Invented Slang: The Secret Language of the Crossroads (Counterpunch) (English and Irish Edition). I never thought of myself as anything beyond generic American, until I read these books. I understand my ancestors and self much better."
4,Scots-Irish,"As an American of Scots-Irish descent, I welcome the spotlight given to my somewhat forgotten ethnic group. It is a good read overall but Webb is too general in his conclusions. So sweeping are his assessments perhaps the book's intention was to introduce and bring the Scots-Irish to reader's attention and nothing more. My only other criticism is Webb's treatment of the Scots-Irish and education. The lasting legacy of the Scottish Presbyterian Church on American education is profound and this was not done by non-Ulster Scots only.Despite the above remarks, I enjoyed this book tremendously and recommend it. Many Americans who read it will discover something of themselves in its pages."
2,Beautiful and Flimsy,"I've had this set for around 6 months now. Two pieces, a spoon and a fork have already broken. Much of it has to do with the tiny plastic balls at the top of the flatware. I will not buy this set again.It looks adorable, however, for everyday use, it's no good. They will look beautiful for about 3 months and then start to break and the silver on the top will wear off and the colors will become dull and lifeless. I suggest buying a different set."
2,Disappointing.,"This set is disappointing, at best. The little silver balls are molded plastic and arrived with sharp little plastic points on them, the coloring of the plastic doesn't match the picture, the 'red' looks more like an ugly brown. Not satisfied with this set."
5,my favorite friday,"this is my favorite ""friday"" flick. i have seen them all, but i just love this one! tom savini's make-up effects are great, jason's cool, and there are fun characters. it is the first of the mini-series (4,5,6) inside the big series centering around tommy jarvis. guys will like it: just trust me."
4,My favorite in the series,"We all know that Friday the 13th: The Final Chapter wasn't the final chapter, but it's still one of the best one made. Tom Savini did wonders on the script and as a make up artist. The film even has some geuine scares and Corey Feldmen as a young Tommy Jarvis was and always be Jason's best oppoent."
2,"A promising start, but then it's business as usual.","1.Jason kills people. 2.A lot of teenagers have sex but get killed because they've fornicated and been naughty. 3.The surviving teenaged girl kills Jason. 4.Someone gets thrown through a window. 5.Jason isn't really dead at all. Sorry. I thought this was Friday the 13th by numbers. Oh, there is a slight difference in this one. It's the lone surviving teenaged girl's younger brother who kills Jason! Wow! Crikey! The makers of these films must have spent months of hard work thinking over that one!"
1,Jason is becoming a bit of a pest,"Pretty much the same story as the rest, nothing terrible interesting. This was supposed to be the last in the series, only it managed to be followed by five sequels. The entire series not really worth having a look at."
3,Pretty good,I find the jerky boys CD's hilarous and looked forward to seeing this film. It is pretty good. It isn't a Continues flow of comedy threw the whole film but there is funny parts such as when the two mob guys fight over who should tell the boss what they did and the prank call to the president kept will keep you laughing all night. Not an oscar winner but a funny film. I think this is good for a collector of comedy films.
2,The DVD didn't cut it.,"The sound track -- which I also own -- sums about all that is good in the DVD. Buy it instead, and find something else to occupy your eyes."
5,A musical for the whole family,This is one of the BEST musicals i have seen. Disney really did something right when they made this movie. In schol we just finished learning about Mr. Pulizer and his newspaper THE WORD and it was fun to watch newies. It is definatly not a tipical movie that you would watch in school because it is not borring and it deffinatly won't put you to sleep. The story is very funny and seirous at the same time. Anyone will love this movie and you'll watch it again and again untill you know all the words to all the songs in the movie. It is defenatly not a waste of money every family should own a copy of Newsies.
5,Best musical of all time,Newsies is the best musical of all time. The music is fantastic and the lyrics are inspirational
5,THIS IS POSITIVELY THE BEST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!!!,People might think that disney movies are...well...kiddie. But i saw this movie and loved it. i want to be in a musical just like it. Buy it 'cause it's the BEST!!!
5,newsies is the best movie ever,"I am SO mad that they stopped releasing the movie, it is my favorite movie ever and i've had a few of the tapes but they all broke and now I have no copies. I first watched the movie when I was 9 and I loved it and wathced it every day. I have been looking for a tape for about 4 years. The movie was great! Please make a DVD version of the movie."
4,A Star in the making,"I bought this movie, because I remember thinking that Christian Bale was probably going to become very famous, when I first saw it. I've been a fan ever since. Very special is the fact, that he had no musical training before working on the movie.It is a fun piece and if you look carefully, lots of the boys who played, sang and danced in this are still working in Hollywood today.The story is based on the true plight of the boys (and girls) who sold newspapers on the street before the wars. Most of them orphans and very poor, they still took action when tycoons like Pulitzer tried to make money per issue by raising their purchase price, but not the price of the paper. The musical approach is very fresh and entertaining (Even Bill Pullman has his sing), this is a family movie with some historical background, well worth watching.The extras are quite good too, with historical background and making of."
4,My Teenager Was Delighted!,"I ordered this as a gift for my 17 year old, as she loved this movie as a child. She loves it, and I did, too. My younger children thought it was okay, as it was a bit long for them. I thought it was charming!"
3,New or Not?,"My mother had been wanting this movie on DVD ever since VHS went by the wayside. I felt so clever for finding it online, where no one else thought to look. It was shrink-wrapped, etc, and looked brand-new. It would not, however, play on the DVD player in my mother's front room. It will play on the one in her bedroom, and she is thrilled to have this movie she loves, even if she can only watch it in the bedroom.My sisters insist that if it won't play on one of the DVD players, it must be a copy. I looks legit and was advertised as new, but the matter of the playability makes me wonder."
5,WHAT AN AWESOME MOVIE!!!!,"This is just about the best musical that I have ever seen. It has excellent music and great story line. I give this movie 5 stars! The acting is great, and the singing is great, and the dancing is just amazing! I think that it is just about time for Disney to make this movie into a broadway show. I'm sure that it would be a great success!!!"
5,The best movie ever made!!!!,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. I broke my last VCR because I watched it over and over again. Please see this movie it's the best. You'll love it. I am only 16, but I fell in love with this movie when I was 10 and still love it to this day!"
5,"""Carry the Banner""","I enjoyed this movie a lot. Let me tell you, i think everyone should see it. The movie portrays trials that still go on today. It is teaches well thought out ethics that we want to teach our children. In turn it allows the world to see that we are all in this together."
4,One of Elfman's Best and Darkest Scores Ever!,"""Night Breed"" seems to represent to me the pinnacle of Danny Elfman's achievement as a composer, equalled only by his astounding work on ""Batman"". The music on this album is haunting, mesmerizing and very, very dark. I highly recommend it."
2,seems too soft,"I like the brand, but the Bubblemint seems too soft and I like regular mint a little better. I think I got a fair deal on a special, but I wonder if I could have gotten better at a club store or a sale. If I HAD to have it I would pay and do it again, but I won't because I don't."
2,WOW!,A movie in which I found was done well for a Friday the 13th sequal. IT was entertaining enough to watch all of the way through. Acting was actually pretty good.
3,"Friday the 13th, Part VI - Jason Lives ~ Tom McLoughlin","Friday the 13th, Part VI - Jason Lives~ Tom McLoughlin is an o.k. movie and not nearly as poorly made as part 5. The script is better, the dialog whilst being very poor is not nearly as atrocious. The acting is slightly better and the kills are much better with Jason having plenty of imagination for his kills. The music is awful and sounds like it was done with a 10 dollar keyboard and even worst special effects. Then again one has to realize that this is the 6th part of the series. Jason is huge in this movie and now he has totally turned into a monster like Godzilla. Even better would be a comparison with a zombie or a ghoul. I love the awful 80's fashion, the worst kind and cheapest 80's music and the chics wearing tacky make up and the even worst hair do. This a totally o.k. movie for horror fans but otherwise this is a questionable watch. Still and all I give this movie 3 out of 5 stars."
3,JASON'S BACK AND HE'S P I S S-ED! 2 1/2 STARS!,"I am writing reviews for each of the Friday the 13th, but I own the box set and the older releases of the later two. The reviews are for those editions not the newer deluxe editions.Jason's back in this enjoyable installment that has the best intro of any of the films! I loved the nod to James Bond films when the camera closes in on Jason's eye! I saw Jason differently from this point forward.The DVD transfer is very good and there are some interesting extras on the box set."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:Slightly less awful than its immediate predecessor and successor, ""Jason Lives"" manages to avoid a lower rating by not taking itself very seriously; it could never be considered good, but if you like Friday movies you should see this one before V, VIII, and (God forbid) Jason Goes to Hell."
3,GOOD MOVIE;JASON RULZE!!!,"This movie was pretty good, expecially at the beginning where Jason Voorhees is now a corpse Zombie while Tommy & his friend OZ head to the cemetry to dig up his grave to be certain that after all those years, Jason is really dead. Or is he???The sight of Jason is not an easy one to watch though with all the bugs and maggots/worms and cobwebs crawl all over his face is quite revolting(still an awesume effect).Throughout the movie, Jason's kills are pretty good, but you don't see much gore unlike the rest of the series.This movie is worth seeing as Tommy Jarvis battles Jason Voorhees to the finish at Camp Crystal Lake.C.J Graham as Jason does an awesume job in this one. 3.5 stars out of 5 for me!!!"
5,The Best F13 Movie,"Jason is back with a vengance in The Best Friday The 13th movie to date. Tommy Jarvis still has doubts in his mind about Jason Being dead so he digs him up and attempts to kill Jason once and for all, but whilst doing so Jason gets hit by lightning and becomes stronger, The slicing and dicing then begins ......"
2,Better than most of these movies but still not very good.,"I'd give it 2 and a half stars. In this installment, the filmmakers decide to go campy given that Jason is basically a Looney Tunes character already. Most of the kills are comically unrealistic which I would add as a plus. The two young lead characters are fairly sympathetic compared to the cardboard cutouts this series is known for but there's still not a lot going on from either of them. This film has gotten the reputation of being ""meta"" and making fun of the slasher cliches but the reputation is oversold; it's not ""Scream."" It seems to embrace those cliches and pointing out that they are cliches doesn't mean they cease to be cliches. I'm left with the feeling that this movie could have been much more than it is; instead it is a modest success. We certainly see that it could be less given that VII and VIII are much worse."
2,NOTHING NEW HERE,"By this sixth entry in the popular Jason franchise, there was every indication that the series had milked Jason for all he was worth, but as we know, 5 more sequels will follow. Oh, well.In this entry, Jason is reanimated when lightning strikes the pole that Tommy Jarvis plunges into his corpse in order to eradicate his demons. After that, it's more blood and gore as Jason goes after the latest batch of counselors. Catch KOTTER's Ron Palillo and GHOST's Tony Goldwyn in early roles...brief though they may be. The third Tommy Jarvis, future martial arts star Thom Matthews is merely irritating and immature, nowhere near the character first embodied by Corey Feldman. For diehard Jason fans only."
5,A good practical size case.,Some reviewers stated they had a problem with the briefcase staying open. I did not have that experience. I do believe the manufacturer would enhance the product if the foam padding were removed. The size suits me as it is the same size of another prior briefcase I had. I cannot speak to the carry strap as I have not and will not use it. There is still plenty of room in the middle section with the padding but I do not think it is needed and I do not intend to carry a laptop in the briefcase except occassionally. I like the combination lock as I carry sensitive material and sometimes need to leave the case in an office or witness room and the combination lock serves the purpose of keeping the contents from prying eyes without having to carry another key. This makes about the eighth briefcase I have carried and so far I like this one better than any of the rest and some of which were considerably more expensive. This is a good case without having to expend $500.
3,Not impressed,"Leather feels cheap, shoulder strap binding is defective, roomy inside, certainly not a high end product, but gets job done if you carry it by the handles."
3,Nice bag but strap sucks,The legal brief is a nice purchase for the price. But the first day I loaded it and tried to use it with the shoulder strap it broke immediately. Just not strong enough or designed to support Normal carrying weight of the bag. Other than that it's a pretty decent purchase.
1,"On a one-to-five scale, this movie owes the scale plenty","Frank Zappa was a great musician, but he was not a visual artist and had no business making movies. ""200 Motels"" is boring and witless and seems to never end. It's like spending the night in hell."
3,A good reference for part-time and full-time traders,"For most individuals, the book recommends creating a Limited Liability Company (LLC) and then discusses some of the benefits that can be had if BOTH the LLC and Mark-to-Market (MTM) accounting are used. Note that it may not be possible for some less active traders to justify the use of the second of those.This is a repetitious book and I would have prefered a different way of organizing the information. For example, the basic strategy and benefits could have been easily explained in the first chapter and subsequent chapters could be used to list all the caveats or alternatives.Nevertheless this is a book I would definitely buy again."
2,"Not Vegetarian, Very Egg and Margarine Heavy","If you're vegan and thinking this book is for you, think again. Lots of meat recipes in this cookbook. And even if you eat meat, not very healthy substitutes for dairy. She relies too heavily on margarine. She's also very heavy into adding eggs. There are much better dairy-free cookbooks out there like Robin Robertson's ""366 Simply Delicious Dairy-Free Recipes"" and Joanne Stepaniak's ""Uncheese Cookbook"" (the dairy-free Brie and Simply Cheezy Sauce in that cookbook are fabulous)."
1,Great Show... Poor Production,"1. DVD's had scratches / glue / etc. Half of there were unwatchable.2. THIS REALLY REALLY PISSED ME OFF. This was a gift for my Korean speaking mother. I was told there were Korean subtitles... and there were... FOR ONLY THE FIRST TWO SEASONS!!!? How does this even happen!?I was going to give this two stars, but back down to one for reminding me how horribly handled this package was. My mom loved the show, but is terribly upset that she won't be able to finish the show because of the lack of subtitles. =("
3,"Superb show, awful packaging","The show is amazing and deserves five stars.The box set design is terrible; the CDs are squeezed inside the pages of the book and hence are difficult to remove, and can quite easily be damaged due to this.If I were to buy this again I'd consider buying each season separately so I had it in a decent case."
1,The Shield - Complete 7 series set,"I purchased this because I am a big fan of Michael Chiklis and the series. I was very disappointed after opening and taking out the 1st disc, it was scratched and had very small, hard particals stuck to the video side. I checked the rest of the disc's and about two thirds of the disc's were in the same shape. A few of them had very deep gouges. Again, I can't tell you how disappointed I was. I returned the set for a refund but I will not buy another set like this. Maybe if Sony changes the packaging I will consider repurchasing it again.I am pretty sure that the way this is packaged and presented is why the disc's were damaged."
3,the shield,"We love the shield television series and followed it every week. I was very excited to order and to have my own copy of the series, however it did not meet my expectations. The book jacket for the dvds is beautiful and very nice for organizing the discs however when we watched the discs they froze, they skipped scenes, they were terrible which was very saddening to us. We made a call to report the situation and were offered a refund. I checked the written reviews and found this complaint multiple times with the probable defect of the dvd slots causing scratches on the discs. The item was new and costly, I considered returning it but checked into repairing the discs ($6.00 per disc @ Game Stop) so I went online to learn how to repair disc, bought the items and gave it a wholehearted try;, some, but minimal improvement. Oh well, I own it. Don't buy it!"
1,Shoddy DVDs,"I'm not sure why these DVDs are in such poor condition, but of the four DVDs from the set I've tried to play, three of them are so badly scratched that the disc skips and I miss portions of the episodes. I don't have any reason to think this isn't brand new, but the discs themselves have adhesive on them and appear to have been rubbed with a nail file. Very disappointed. Unfortunately I didn't discover this until the return window had passed so I'm stuck with a very expensive set of coasters."
3,Surprised at this series,"Since I had never seen any episodes of this series I was taken off guard that this show was allowed on tv even though it's my understanding it isn't during the time children would watch it.I thought it was a bit over the top for television and was disappointed that it was so explicit.I got the ""Commish"" complete series because I really like Michael Chiklis and would definitely recommend it but bought this because of Michael Chiklis and it's not in my estimation something I would recommend to anyone.Some people may like this...I do not."
2,"Scratched Discs, Poor ""Protection"" Mar A Beautiful Set","I also bought the set when Amazon had the Gold Box Deal and after opening them I found the same issues as many consumers have experienced. Even with the ""protection,"" which amounts to little more than two circular pieces of calender paper the discs had scratches all over.And it really is a shame because this is really a beautiful set that's made to look like a coffee table book and the discs are near invisible if you don't look for them. I was really hoping Sony had fixed this by now but it looks like they have not. I'll be contacting Sony tomorrow to ask about getting a replacement. Hopefully they've come up with a better solution to this issue than two thin pieces of paper, because I would really love to have this set for my collection."
2,Boxed set needs work,"Great series, but it's hard to say the boxed set is really a good deal; I got one with all the paper sleeves, so no discs were scratched or covered with glue, but it *was* missing the very last disc. Sony seems very helpful; the folks at 800-860-2878 have told me they'll be sending me a copy of the missing disk. Still; getting to the last two episodes of the series and having to wait a few weeks for the disc to show up? Not terrible; but certainly a bad surprise."
3,Finally All The Seasons Together !!!,This is on of the best series that was on tv at the time and set the standard for cop shows. The reason I gave this set three stars was because of the transfer quality is very poor! They are grainy to the point that words are hard to read on a HD tv and the audio takes a while to start. Its still a favorite and a good collection just wished for better quality.
2,"Pretty, but doesn't stick to painted wall","This is a very pretty border, but it does not stay stuck to painted wall. As in other reviews, once the border was easily applied, it came down the next morning. My room has a nice, high quality paint. I have not tried to use any wall paper glue yet. I was hoping the peel and stick would work."
2,"OK book, not the author's best work!","This book was an ""ok read"", but not the page-turner, I had anticipated. After reading her other novels, I expected more from this author. The plot seemed a little unrealistic and does life always have to be about a happy ending? What's going on with the IR twists in the as of late book(s)? All and all, it was an ""ok read."""
2,"just ""okay""","I've read Rosalyn McMillan's other novels and found them to be very well written (save the Harlequin Romance-like names she gives her characters) Unlike the others, I found this story to be a bit flat and much more predictable. I am afraid that she may be following too closely in her sisters footsteps-- becoming more concerned with the quantity of books she turns out than she is with the QUALITY."
3,AN IMPROVEMEMT,THIS IS THE THIRD BOOK I HAVE READ OF MS MCMILLIAN'S AND I FOUND IT TO BE A GREAT IMPROVEMENT FROM THE PREVIOUS BOOKS. THIS BOOK HAD AN REALISTIC PLOT THAT ONE COULD FOLLOW. SHE ALSO SEEMED TO DEVELOP HER CHARACTERS MORE. ALSO THERE WAS LESS GRAPHIC SEX SCENES WHICH WAS REFRESHING! HOWEVER I THINK THE AUTHOR COULD HAVE LET US USE OUR IMAGINATION CONCERNING THE SEX SCENES. HOPEFULLY HER NEXT BOOK WILL BE MUCH BETTER.
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...sadly, the best song on the CD is the one NON-duet song, ""Duets For One."" This just doesn't work."
2,Fans can never be objective...,"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...Elton has never been good in concert because he isn't able to put a new spin on his music when played live and when it doesn't have the lush production it falls flat. Kudos for employing a symphony, but it still doesn't make it memorable."
4,Great book for people who worry or have lots of questions.,"This book has loads of common-sense divorce information. I am a divorce lawyer in Michigan and I learned of the book when a client of mine showed it to me. I was surprised at the quality of the information. This book is accurate and up-to-date and explains difficult concepts in an easy to understand manner. I tell all my divorce clients about it and suggest that they buy the book. This book is worth many times the price in answering questions that most people have when going through a divorce. If you have a divorce lawyer, buy it and save by not having your lawyer answer basic questions. If you don't have a lawyer, this book will let you know what to expect in a divorce."
1,One star because I can't give it zero stars,This was just horrible. It's not even in the IMDB. What does that say to you? No real plot. Horrible dialogue. Awful awful awful. This is 93 wasted minutes of my life that I will never be able to get back.
1,region restrictions,"I bought this for my dads 60th having already seen it and thinking it was a great gift. It was delivered on time but it turned out the region was not compatible with his blu ray player in the UK. This is a joke. It was ordered from amazon.co.uk to be delivered to a house in the UK to be played on a blu ray player from the UK. I realise you guys are merely the distributors but having just found out today that he wasn't able to watch it watch leaves me completely disappointed. Its no wonder people turn to piracy. I could have downloaded this for free and sent it to him that way. Instead i did it this way and the entire gesture has ruined by pointless, archaic restrictions that simply put people off buying content in a legitimate way. I would like to know if this can be fixed."
5,A Must See,"A wonderful documentary of moon exploration. The interviews with the astronauts who traveled to the moon coupled with the historical footage were outstanding. I enjoyed meeting the astronauts and hearing their thoughts about the space program and how their travels through space changed their lives. This disc has special meaning to me, because I remember seeing a lot of the footage on the TV when it was happening - but now I have some behind-the-scenes info, too!"
4,The Fortune's Are Back!!,"This is the first book in a new series where we are introduced to another branch of the Fortune's of Texas family tree.This series is titled, The Fortune's of Texas;The Lost Heirs.In this first book, we meet Kane Fortune who is the son of Miranda. Who is Miranda?? Read the book. In one night of passion, Kane feels he has met the ""one"" and proposes marriage. The marriage gets off to a rocky start, but the path smooths out in time.This book is great. Ms. Winston is a fantastic writer, who has written other great books. The book is defintely a page-turner and keeps you glued to the book. You will not be able to put it down. If you read previous books in the Fortune series, you definitely won't want to miss this new series.Enjoy and Happy Reading."
4,Everyday worthy towel,"Got wind of the special deal on this towel (free handtowels with purchase at the time) and jumped on it. The towels are pretty decent. They are no primo weight or high end in that regard but after their first wash, they come out a little more comfortable and absorbent than straight out of the box. I can't see them being a long-term towel (5-10 years); for that I would recommend looking into the Martex Atelier line."
4,Get This Book!,"I was familiar with Flash yet very intimidated to try and learn Director, but this book presented itself clearly and conscisely. Right from the start it gets you through the most basic tasks, giving you really great tips and hints along the way. I was impressed with how much I could create with the program after just one day. It's extremely well written in easy to understand. Don't let its size intimidate you, (1200+ pages)...its well worth it."
4,Examples are Great!,"The author Phil Gross wrote this book very well. Although, his style of writing and explanation isn't the best, it is the examples. He gives great examples on how to do things in certain situations. Guiding yourself is very easy, because tells you if you should start here or there depending if you are a beginner or not. I would definitley recommend this book to others."
4,Dora was great!,"Very nice and entertaining...My kids and niece loved it! My kids love dora, it's very educational and enjoyable even my 2 year old loves it."
1,Left the car stranded,Replaced one that was going out. Worked great for a few weeks - then it left me stranded a couple of times when the truck would not start. Go with a different product
4,Babe Didrikson Zaharias,"Babe Didrikson Zaharias: The making of a champion, by Russell Freedman. This book was great. It doesn't just tell about her adult life; it also talks about how she got started, like when she was young. She was always the tomboy type until she was in her twenties. As she got older, she had to be the center of all the attention. To tell you the truth, she was always full of herself, which wasn't always a good thing. Babe participated in almost every sport that a woman could do. She was good at every one of them, too. She turned professional in track and field, basketball, and golf. I recommend this book to any girl who loves to compete in sports. I really didn't have a role model until I read this book!"
4,"Edited, but still watchable","I first saw this movie over an anime site when it was first released, to be honest, I loved it when it was a 'mockumentary,' having the little pieces of live action poked in filled it when needed. On the Box, it says it's 75 minutes long, but the English dub is only 60 minutes. Making it less filling. The Dubbing isn't all that bad, but nothing close to the work Funimation does.So all in all, the original was great, but the English version fails to achieve the greatness that was First Squad."
1,I was disappointed but Ill buy the conclusion -Jult Warfell,The story was well orchastreted. If you must watch then enjoy with pain. I did but I will watch the conclusion......... -Jult Warfell
2,Glad I didn't pay for this book!,"I was looking forward to a light summer read and then I read this book. It was light alright...light and stupid. Heaven, help me. No. Heaven help this book. How can I enjoy it when I have no respect for the main character. She doesn't even respect herself. She has no morals, no job, and no sense; and she's constantly acting like an idiot. By the time you get to the payoff, it's completely anticlimatic. And I'm sad to say I only laughed out loud once. Don't waste your time."
4,Entertaining & funny,I really enjoy reading this book. It's funny and light-hearted. Can't wait to read her next book.
1,am not happy,this is one the poster i buy with moviegoods fake poster bad colors and for the price i pay what i get garbage
1,Dumb book full of dumb analogies,"Actually, this book would be pretty good if you could wade through all the stupid analogies that are supposed to make the subject accessible. Each chapter begins with a bunch of really stupid examples that are simply distracting. Writing a match statement is like collecting groceries in a grocery store -- fetching the milk and cookies for your mom, etc., etc. The book is so full of this dreadful stuff that it becomes completely unreadable."
4,Following the trails of Aleytys',"Having a heroine with extraordinary powers brings this story in line with Jo Claytons previous books on the adventures of Aleytys. Sold into slavery to insectoid owners, Aleytys discovers she is to serve as proxy-mother to the old Queens successor. In short being both the bearer and food source for the embryo she carried.With her own enhanced abilities, and the added mystical strength of the diadem, the story of Aleytys' gives us a rousing adventure with unusual twists and turns. A tough, believable, swords and sorcery story to engage the imagination and satisfy the most ardent reader searching for fantasy and satisfaction."
5,Wouldn't use any other brush now,"The Marilyn Brush replaced all my other brushes. I have the Uptown and Downtown, and they both do wonders to my hair. Yes, its a bit pricey, but if you want traffic stopping hair, this is for you! I have coarse, long black hair, and every time I brush, it looks like newly clean brushed ""volumey"" hair instead of stringy oily hair. Downtown is great in your purse. I guess what makes this different from other brushes is the little plastic thingies that shoot out more than the boar hairs. It really does massage my head. It might be rough on some heads, but on mine, it feels good and it actually builds circulation to prevent hair loss. Just make sure you clean the brush every now and then (I never realized how much lint I captured in my hair)."
4,Easy Listening,Very pleasant listening - different - kind of irish folk but not harsh or demanding - nice
5,Great collection of Godzilla movies,"This is a must-have for any serious Godzilla movie lover. I hope they hurry and release Godzilla 2000 [English region 1] on DVD, as well as all the other Godzilla movies that they have yet to release on DVD in the USA. King Kong vs. Godzilla and Godzilla vs. Destroyah [aka Destroyer] are among the best - but those don't come in this set. Still, these movies in this set are a must-have for any serious collector or even hobbiest. Godzilla rules! [Not the 1998 one though! <g>]"
3,just ok,"I thought I would flip over this book. I expected it to be a gem. However, it was disappointing with just bits of wisdom spread here and there. The editor of this book should probably be questioned. The selected elements are not especially wise or astounding."
3,I was really enjoying this book and then...,"I left it on the airplane, I guess I will have to buy it again to see how it works out."
3,no title,"This balladist (not quite poet) of the Middle West, sort've a Herb Shriner or Will Rogers of his day, whose books sold millions of copies, seems very representative of the great sentimentality of Americans. He writes of plain, homespun home and hearth, Mother Son, Wife, Work, Nature and some are even quite amusing. Easy to read and appealing in a simplistic sort of way. A really terrible poet, yet Guest does manage very ably to convey the joys, sorrows, worries, of the common man. He shows these things to the masses, and if he is an artificial flower to Robert Frost's perfect rose, yet to many beauty often is such an artificial flower. Not even in the same world as Frost, but the library book I got was well worn and read. One poem, called ""A Man Must Want"" very succinctly sets down what I believe. Laughed aloud at some."
2,"audio only, not a video, of a performance of the Elgar cello concerto","If you think you are going to get a DVD video of Karine Georgian's performance of Elgar's cello concerto, think again. You get the audio only of the concerto. So what is the video in this DVD? It is a succession of video clips that someone thought looked good with the Elgar cello concerto playing in the background. For example the cello chords that begin the concerto provide the background music to a close-up of the head of a cow chewing its food. If you think watching a cow chew its food adds to your pleasure listening to the Elgar cello concerto, then buy this DVD. Or if you think listening to the Elgar cello concerto adds to your pleasure watching a cow chew its food, then buy this DVD. If you want to hear Karine Georgian's performance of the concerto, you can buy the Amadis CD for a lot less money than buying this DVD. And if you want to watch Karine Georgian play the concerto (as I did), you are out of luck."
3,The Gallant Hours DVD,"The DVD appears to be very cheaply manufactured. There is no menu and the movie begins after the completion of a very lengthy ""reading"" process. I've done a better job of DVD production when dubbing DVDs from old homemade VHS videotapes."
3,MADE IN THE US CHINA QUALITY,The product was received with the PVC drill holes in the wrong end (at the top). I had to drill my own holes to attach it to its base. The attachment hardware are nickle plated not galvanized.
2,Static problem,"I bought an iSkin keyboard protector for a PowerBook G4, and used it for almost a year with no problem at all. When I purchased a new iBook G4, I wanted to use the iSkin with it, but this time, like what ""Learned Hand"" wrote, there was a huge problem. Lifting the iSkin from the iBook would repeatedly and consistently cause a catastrophic crash. I didn't know at the time that it was due to static (I thought it was heat-related). It also doesn't seem to fit the iBook as well as it fit the PowerBook. And yes, I've tried cleaning it, washing it, massaging it, etc. Needless to say, iSkin no more for me."
3,Antique Guns: The Collector's Guide,"Very interesting, but not exactly what I was looking for. Still a very informative book."
4,A practical side of Black-Scholes,"This is a good follow-up to Crack's ""Heard On the Street"" with more practical help for beginners in quantitative finance. It's basically a review of standard options pricing with a lot of Black-Scholes. For me the strength is a lot of conceptual reflection on how the formulas work, what individual terms mean, and how to apply with useful approximations. I was hoping for more case studies of options prices and looking at how stock and options prices interact in the market. This book really doesn't do that. But if you want a derivation of Black-Scholes and thoughtful discussion of terms and parameters this is excellent."
1,Missing DVD #5,"Buyer Beware. My child just started 6th grade. I ordered these dvds early to be prepared. Well, the set is supposed to come with 6 DVDs and one companion CD-ROM. I just unwrapped the plastic and DVD #5 is missing. DVD #5 covers Algebra Equations which are the most important lessons of the set. I am really disappointed. I got ripped off $119.00."
3,Tangled mess...leaky ball But still had fun,The rope boundary ropes were impossible to untangle...we cut them eventually. Everything else went up easily. My daughters and neighbors love the set...Except the Volleyball will not hold air overnight. I finally checked the return policy and noticed i missed the return date. We'll see if Amazon reads these.
2,Season 3 is disappointing,"Seasons one and two were laugh-out-loud funny, but season three misses. There are some funny moments, but it's not as sharp as the other seasons. It did pick up towards the end, though, so I hope season four will capture the magic that was the first two seasons! I love the entire cast in each respective role. They do play their characters to perfection, and it's fun to see how well they all get along behind the scenes, too. And naturally Betty White is a scream!!! This season was a waste of their talent... so here's hoping for a turn around in season four."
5,Our New Favorite Show!,"We just started watching Hot in Cleveland a few days ago, and we are already almost all the way through all the seasons. If you're feeling a little blue and need some cheering up, this show is good medicine! Every single episode has us laughing out loud. I'm thankful we don't have neighbors because we would pretty much annoy the heck out of them from laughing so loud. This is very much like the old TV Land shows like I Love Lucy. It's just good ol' fashioned humor. When I first watched the first few episodes a few months ago I wasn't impressed, but then I gave it another try and we can't stop watching!"
5,I enjoy Hot In Cleveland very much. It is a delightful comedy.,I would recommend this show to anyone who wants to forget their troubles for a few minutes and laugh out loud. I love Betty White. She is an inspiration to me.
2,Season 3 is disappointing,"Seasons one and two were laugh-out-loud funny, but season three misses. There are some funny moments, but it's not as sharp as the other seasons. It did pick up towards the end, though, so I hope season four will capture the magic that was the first two seasons! I love the cast, including Valerie Bertinelli, who has been a favorite of mine since her ""One Day at a Time"" days. And naturally Betty White is a scream!!! This season was a waste of their talent... so here's hoping for a turn around in season four."
3,The title and series are Essentials,"The previous reviewer missed the point of both the book and the series it is a part of. These are short, condensed reviews of subjects, for reference and refreshing.If you want a teaching book by this author (Omer Carey), check the used section for ""Financial Tools for Small Businesses"", a 1983 275pg paperbook so good it still sells for 25-35$US. Its a meaty, practical course with lots of real world, substantial case studies/exercises to work through. Even if all you want to do is learn how to interpret annual reports, its a winner. It is pre-spreadsheet software (at least for many folks), so you'll want to supplement it by identifying the corresponding Excel functions to accomplish the math. (But try it by hand first, you'll learn more.)"
3,good glove,"Great glove for what it was desiged for. But a little lite for auto mechanics,and the fingers should be cut back a little more. Workmanship is good."
4,Inhalation,"I use the Sphere in Tai Chi classes to model the inhalation phase of deep breathing.In Buddhist ""natural"" breathing (as distinguished from Taoist ""reverse"" breathing) the muscles around the lower abdomen expand--just like the Sphere expands--in all 6 directions (forward/backwards, up/down and left/right).All points expanding is a ""yang"" movement, while the inside fills and pressurizes is ""yin"" allowing Qi to flow in to the tantien (chest volume increases/air pressure decreases in lungs allowing outside air to flow in to the lungs.)The Sphere is a perfect visual model of this process.Everyone (grandkids especially) are fascinated with the Sphere, even without the lesson on deep-breathing.Nevertheless the Sphere is a bit of a one-pony toy.Furthermore, it is not a perfect model of the exhalation phase of deep breathing.For that I use a stuff-sack with draw-strings--figure that one out yourself."
4,Comprehending a real situation,"A group of six mentally challenged people travelled to Egypt.At the beginning boring, a story grasped attention with a hard work professionals did to make this trip happened.Perhaps, at least a dozen of researches had been contributed from this project while too many significant issues leaved off the tale: comprehending a real situation of living with and caring after cognitive but mentally handicapped is beyond possibility of not experiencing such a legal paradox complicated with those confused persons' assets in many cases stimulating strangers' attention to a great extent."
5,12 months + FABULOUS!,"This TV is an amazing value. Better than LCD quality & all the features you need for the new era.I have no idea what folks are complaining about! This TV is awesome. My son bought the 30"" widescreen version and he loves it.I'm looking at LCD TV's for another room right now and when comparing prices this TV is still a winner if you care about what the picture looks like vs. whether or not it is an LCD. Quality and price, just awesome.This is my sixth Samsung TV since 1983. The 1983 Color TV still works.Samsung is the best value on the market today."
4,I got a good one,Bought mine in the summer of 2008. One of the last CRT televisions. Good Picture quality. Okay sound. Smaller depth than older CRT televisions. Less expensive than LCD. Audio video input on left side is not very sturdy - one yank on an input cable caused it to stop working.Update: Almost 2 yrs of use and no additional complaints.
3,Great review.,"Although the images in the book are dated, the stretches and xercises shown are very useful."
1,A GREAT MOVIE! For four year olds.,"This was, without a doubt, the worst ROFTN. I was particularly dissapointed with Curtis Armstrong's performance as Booger. He's not the vulgar, greasy outcast we all fell in love with in ROFTN. Instead, he's gentler and more politically correct. He claims, in the movie, that hiring a female dancer for his bachelor party, would be sexist. While in the first movie, through the use of a spy camera, he and the other nerds watch sorrority girls undress all night long. Without the swearing, the movie really isn't funny at all. And now Ogre and Stan are nerds! This movie didn't live up to the original's standards AT ALL."
5,loved it,excellent learning tool for anyone getting started in reloading. I learned a lot and would recommend this video to all my friends.
3,ok..,wasn't expecting it to be sooo big & really can't use it on making my homemade cards but will have neice & nephew make holiday craft with it tho...
3,Southern Camp,"O.k.,This was a fun movie to watch, some nice eye candy.The quick transformation of the mother and aunt is a littlehard to believe, but overall I did not regret renting this film."
3,You Should Meet My Son,"A cute movie with a great story, and a real twist. I especially loved the mother and her sister. Their characters were clever, and extremely well played. The entire film was a lot of fun."
1,"YHEA VERY FUNNY, SO WHAT","Very, very funny, but maybe to stereotypical for my tastes. Loved it when the mom and aunt changed. Loved the story. Maybe I just imagine it could be true."
5,Great Movie,"Love this movie. It is one of my favorite independent Gay films. It is well acted, written and has a wonderful cast that makes you feel like that."
5,Works Great,"Good construction, nice fabric, keeps everything dry just like it promises. We took them camping with us and of course it rained, we were really glad to have all our clothes and stuff in them! I would definitely recommend these to a friend."
5,"So far, so great!","This has been a great little bag so far - I use it mainly in commuting to and from work by bike (we live in very rainy Oregon), but I will definitely be using it on hiking and camping trips as well. To give an idea of the size, it easily fits my thin REI hiking backpack (with 15"" laptop), water jug, coffee mug, change of clothes, wallet, and other small work necessities, and can still roll up 3x for water-proofing. Also, although it's not very important, I love the color and it's a very light-weight, nice-looking dry bag. The only thing I would say that's not so good is that with all that heavy stuff if I pick it up by the top, the clips sometimes come apart (I think the clips might be a little bit on the weak side)."
5,Works. Keeps stuff dry.,"Used this to put my niece's several thousand dollar insulin pump, expensive camera equipment and cell phone into while hiking the Virgin river. The bag was heavily splashed but not immersed and kept the equipment dry. This was larger than we actually needed, but allowed padding with towels between all the electronics.My daughter then used it on a camping trip where it was left in heavy (downpour) rain for several hours. She was the only one with dry clothes and sleeping bag afterward.You MUST roll the seal, and this does take a little bit of time."
4,A great version from the 1989 blockbuster!,"This is one of the best batmobiles ever. I saw the movie a bit of a long time ago and this batmobile was very awesome! The windows open when they,re pushed to the front and the 2 oval shaped things turn to reveal machine guns just like in the movie. This is one of the best collectors items ever."
1,Don't buy from this vendor,"Although the two pairs of slippers I received LOOKED really comfortable and awesome, I was never able to wear them (and I still don't have a pair) because of Shoes.comI ordered XL brown plush twice, and was so disappointed when I received M twice. Although their customer service reps were pleasant and returning the botched orders was easy, I still don't have the slippers.I would recommend the product, but get it from somewhere else."
4,Great Resource,I teach high school special education. This workbook gives students words that are reviewed daily with different skills including using context clues and analogies. Great book!
3,glue,it sticks more to skin then the object but it does work it might leave a film but it will hold against most surfaces
3,"not worth $30+ , paid 6.99",i paid $6.99 for these two pans . These are thin sheet metal pans and are not the top quality product .
4,GOOD FOR THE PRICE,"THESE ARE PRETTY GOOD SKILLETS, THEY ARE A LITTLE THICKER THEN THE CHEAPER ONES YOU BUY THAT DON'T LAST, HOWEVER, THEY WILL BURN THE ITEM IF YOU DO NOT KEEP THE FIRE LOW OR BURNER ON LOW."
4,A nice set of pans for the price,"These have been great pans so far. They cook evenly, clean up easily and they lie perfectly flat on my flat-top stove. The only thing I didn't care for (which I never thought of before purchasing) is that the bolts to hold the handles are seen on the inside of the pan. For things like scrambled eggs, this takes an extra second or two to clean around the crevices. This is minor however and I would purcase these same pans again at an inexpensive price."
5,Great bargin for great pans,These are fantastic for the money ($7.50) with free shipping. The pans are just the right weight and they are certainly non-stick. Something to keep in mind is that the handle gets hot. With other pans it is obvious but the silicone grip can be deceptive. It is only to assist with holding the pan and oven mits or gloves (or extreme caution) should be used when handling the pan. I highly recommend this set.
5,My favorite skillets!,"These skillets are great! I love the handles, too! They're a great size and hold up nicely."
3,red faberware pans,"I ordered and received 2 sets. One set was in perfect condition and I gave as a gift. The other set I kept for myself. The problem with the 2nd set? The smaller pan was in fine condition but the larger was obviously bent near the top of the handle, a manufacuring defect. NOT due to shipping or packaging. The good part is that the pan is usable, the bottom is flat. The bad part is how noticeably disfigured it is. As I was using it, family members would come up and say, ""What happened to the pan?"" I decided to keep it since it works anyway and wasn't worth returning. However, it was disappointing. I didn't read anything about receiving 2nds... did I miss something?"
5,Sacagawea's Child--a gem.,"As a Lewis and Clark historical interpreter, I have found scholary articles dealing with Jean Baptiste or Sacagawea or Toussaint but the authors rarely cover all three. A few recent books have attempted to cover all the Charbonneau family members but failed to be as well researched and thorough as Ms. Colby's. Her insightful and well documented passages allow the reader to understand the motivation that led the Charbonneaus to action and made them crucial to Lewis and Clark and westward expansion. This is the definitive book for understanding the 100-year saga of Toussaint Charbonneau, his young wife, Sacagawea and their son, Jean-Baptiste, who became the prototype American adventurer and pioneer. As I historically present Toussaint Charbonneau, this book will be held in one hand as the ultimate historical reference."
1,Do Not Waste Money On This,"Well I am a huge Hellraiser fan and was actually excited about another Hellraiser being made. Even though I knew Doug Bradley wouldn't be playing Pinhead, I was still anxious to see this movie. I read some reviews before buying and most were pretty bad. Well, other movies that have gotten bad reviews actually turned out to be pretty good so I didn't put much stock into the reviews. Let me tell you, all of the bad reviews are dead on! This movie was horrible. Everything about it was bad. The acting was just awful, the story was weak and Pinhead sucked. Bottom line is if you are a Hellraiser fan, do yourself a favor and don't expose yourself to this trash."
2,What a failure,"I barely made it to the end. Honestly, what the heck it was all about? No story. Bad acting. And the end was so enforced that it was no conclusion of any kind. I hope they are not planning to make Revelations 2. The only reason I am giving it 2 stars it's because I've actually made it to the end. The reason maybe because I had nothing else to do, late pre-Halloween Saturday night."
5,"""..GOOD SEQUEL..""","This is in actual fact not a bad film, most people have probably not even seen it and are just haters, The story is ok and probably better than the last few sequels, you see a fare amount of pinhead like you did in the originals and female chatterer and several other cenobites that look rather cool, there is bloody gore that is rather good and has classic chain deaths, pinhead himself even though its a different actor looks actually ok and is a fresh change after all these years, the makeup is good and he sounded ok, I spoke to Doug bradly at comicon and he turned down the role merely because he didnt want to do it anymore, even though this movie was only made because the studio needed to keep the rights!! I am just glad to see another hellraiser film no matter the direction its taken, for what its worth its really not that bad, its low budget but has a gritty realism and all the elements that make a hellraiser story, just accept it."
5,Great Blu-Ray!,"I Love This Blu-Ray! I Know This Movie!!!!!!! It Came Out On DVD & Blu-Ray October 18th,2011.You Have To Get This Version! I Got This For $1.00. This Is Hellraiser: Revelations. Great Movie!!!!!!"
4,A Favorite,The variety pack was used for prizes at a baby shower. Theme of party was Hawaiian. Selection was great and all varieties were satisfactory!
5,Yes!,"I've been a big fan of Laura's for a few years now and didn't know she had a book out - I bought it the minute I saw it. It's great, I really felt like I got to know the person behind the jokes and understood where she was coming from. Highly recommended."
4,"Life is really good, isn't it!","Apesadumbrado, apenas tuve que robar una línea del libro para el título.. Chuckles to youself, a little smile you see reflected in the window as you glance up to look around to see if you've been caught... Scary, funny, & worth the ride!"
3,"Though a fun read, it's not funny","These stories generally lack Kightlinger's sarcasm and bite, with the exception of the discussion on the items left in grandmother's casket. Her frankness and lonliness still make the stories a good read. It was not all that funny like I was expecting it to be."
2,Kind of strange,"This book is kind of a strange book. Laura writes about her life and experiences. She sounds like a sweet person, and I really enjoyed reading about her. BUT, these tales were NOT funny at all! I mean, was this SUPPOSED to be a funny book? I didn't laugh even once while reading the book. It is a nice read - but if you really want to laugh with someone as he goes through life - get Jay Leno's book."
5,Unique,"Luara Kightlinger is a sensual, brunette dreamboat with a most deviant, exciting and brilliant comic mind, who can load a sentence with enough ammo to take out a Viking."
1,Not Durable,"My dogs chewed this into pieces within 10 minutes of playing with it. Not EVERLASTING, not worth the money."
5,Perfect for my 9-month old GSD puppy,"My German Shepherd puppy (9 months old) is still teething and is an aggressive chewer. This toy was recommended to me by the owner of the local pet store. At first, I had my doubts but ended up buying it for Schatzi's Shadow. That was two months ago and she's still chewing and loving it. I filled both sides with the liver treat and she can pick up the ball and it bounces and rolls, so she can chase it, catch it and have a good chew. Not even the non-food part is ripped or torn. I'd definitely recommend this to parents of teething puppies!"
4,My dogs LOVE this toy,"I have two German Shorthair Pointers who can be very destructive with their toys... this one they absolutely love even without putting any treats in it. Eventually, they were able to tear it apart so it is not indestructible... i.e. not ""Everlasting""... but it did last several months."
4,Best purchase I've made!,"My dog can destroy ANYTHING!!! Except this ball! He loves chewing on it to his heart's desire and it hasn't punctured, ripped, or even gotten a mark on it. Although it is hard to get treats into/out of so he spends most of his time trying to get them out (which isn't necessarily a bad thing) he doesn't usually get rewarded for his efforts and sometimes gets bored."
2,"High priced, cheap looking","From the packaging to the actual product, everything seemed cheap, especially compared to the Reed & Barton products that were purchased at the same time for about the same price."
5,Fine works,"I'm really happy with this compilations, as that stuff allows you toget a large number of tunes, impossible to get from any other place."
2,karebear,after one week of having this product i am goin to send it back for a replacement because the first ones screen would just come up white at times when i would turn it onand sometimes the play button wouldnt even work
2,Apple Ipod 5th generation,"I received this item. I must have misunderstood the terms, because I thought I was buying ""new"" unit. Unfortunately, I have experienced difficulties with the unit pretty much from the time I received it. It is now not functioning (device is not recognized by my USB port). Seller has not been very communicative, and to date has not responded to my request for repair or replacement. I recommned that you source your ipods elsewhere."
1,"Great Hype, Poor Functionality, Junk.","First, $300 Bucks, no case, no manuals. Ear buds, USB cable and IPod. You now have to buy tons of accessories and software just to use this Piece Of S***. What a marketing scam.Buying this 30GB IPod has been a nightmare. It proceeded to lock up every computer in my house and was in a constant locked up state until I figured out Apple's 2 finger salute to reset it. It has consumed days of my life. If you have a library of Mp3s that are older and do not have ID3v2 encoding (ie Artist, Album, Track information embedded in each mp3 file) the IPod will scramble ALL your albums and audio books. This is a very non-intuitive device that is still very buggy. I would wait until it is ready for release, maybe 2007. I am returning this piece of Junk Tuesday. Good Riddance."
5,GREAT PRODUCT !!!,"IT WAS A GREAT PRODUCT AND PERFECT SERVICE, PLEASE GUYS THIS IS THE BEST OPTION !!"
3,Ipod,"It was a good, cheap used ipod I bought however, it freezes in cold weather (I have to warm it up before using it) and sometimes dies randomly."
4,30 GB iPod,I wear my iPod while running and the left earbud keeps falling out. Would be nice to have something better than the earbuds provided.
1,"Beware: it can lose files, but I found a way to recover them","I am on an expensive overseas trip taking many photos. I had downloaded pictures to the 30GB video ipod successfully several times. After a 500MB download from my camera with many gigs of space left on the ipod, the photo menu disappeared except for the slideshow settings submenu, and I can no longer see if the photo files are still there. These photos are critical to my work as an artist, and I sure hope apple has some file recovery software or much of my trip is lost. Meanwhile, I have to recommend: DO NOT PUT CRITICAL INFORMATION ON THE IPOD!Later: I got to a fast internet connection and found info on the Apple site that allowed me to recover the lost items by resetting the software. Phew! I still can't figure out why the stuff disappeared in the first place. So, it's up to you...."
5,I love my ipod!,"The ipod 5g is great. It is so easy to use. The videos look amazing on it. I've had mine for over 2 months and it dosn't have any visible scratches. The battery life is good and the apple click wheel is really cool. I have lots of photos on it and it takes up hardly any memory. The price is great. why geat a 4gb ipod nano for 250$ when you can buy a 30gb ipod with VIDEO for 50$ more. I love my ipod, and I would highly recomend it to anyone."
4,Great product. Weak battery life.,I love everything about my new video Ipod except the battery life. The box claims it can play songs for up to 14 hours but I've found reality to be more like 8. I don't really watch videos on it but I can only assume that would deplete the battery very quickly.
3,Basically a music player,"Biggest disappointment is that you cannot manipulate / edit / rename photos neither in iTunes nor in Windows Expplorer. Also, when data is stored on iPod by using it as external hard disk, you have no access to it from iPod even if it is music, photos or videos. I believe it is doable. Some much cheaper gadgets on the market can do it."
3,Weak,"I recieved a new 30 gigabyte ipod video for christmas and two weeks later the screen managed to short out, causing ink to start spilling out and ruining itself. Apple will not replace the ipod because they are saying it is physical damage done by the owner, which it isnt. Afterward the battery also stopped working entirely, but apple is still not willing to replace it. I say get a quality mp3 player or even an older photo ipod because its not worth being out 300-400 dollars . I also have the 3 year warranty and a service plan on the ipod."
2,Not meeting the expectations,"I bought this ipod with a fancy thought in mind that it will serve the purpose of Radio,Voice Recorder etc etc as claimed, but I am very sorry to say that for all these features you have to buy extra accessories which comes out to be of the same cost as iPod itself :-( :(Another thing is, this iPod is not at all user frindly, to upload my own movie from camera, it took 2 hrs and FYI the size of the movie clip was only 40MB , so now you can imagine.The case provided is such a cheap quality that you cant use that case. You cant charge the iPod while it is in case, you cant see the movie while it is in the case.Apple should increase the quality of these things also.For me its not a good deal to buy such a costly product.So friends be careful to buy this product."
5,real real good!,"I had bought this way back in 2005 and was extremely pleased by it! Apple as such needs no introduction and this product did not fail to impress either. I guess it would have been useful even now hadn't it been stolen. With the iPhone now though, it tends towards redundancy..."
4,Beware older computer owners.,"I would have given this, my second ipod, 5 stars but for one troubling detail. The new ipods connect via usb and NOT firewire. This means if you have a mac older than 3 years (usb 1) your file transfers will be painfully slow. It took almost 5 hours to move my measly 13gb worth of files!!!!! For some reason Apple chose not to support firewire in this model. This makes my firewire cables obsolete. It's pretty annoying. Otherwise it's absolutely fabulous"
4,"ipod is flawless, itunes software is not","i have been using my ipod 12 hrs a day nearly every day since july and find it to be perfect. excellent video quality, button response, and battery life. I even dropped it accidentally about 3 feet onto a concrete floor at work. it was only in the thin cover supplied with it but was fine. However, the version of itunes that came with it does not organize artists or songs well at all. It put several listings of the same artists with only a few songs each that all came from same source on the ipod. very annoying. Then the latest version of itunes it suggested i download a few weeks ago causes my Dell jukebox i use at home to crash everytime at startup. Still havent solved that problem yet. The software is loaded with gliches when used on a PC."
5,A perfect gift 4 the Whole Family!,"Now my kids can see movies while i drive them to school, Dad(me) had the perfect gadget to complete my requirements (movies while out of the country, Music for my car, Hard drive to back up my emails, and my 8gb of music. Video its Fantastic! Sound AWWWWSOME!!!THANKS SANTA JOBS!!! To GIVE US this November Gift!"
1,Broke two weeks after getting it,"After all of the hype I've heard about the iPod I was extremely disappointed to have my iPod break after only two weeks of use. I was extremely careful with it and nonetheless I got the dreaded ""folder with an exclaimation point"". I tried all of the troubleshooting tips that are mentioned on the Apple website to no avail. I had to send it back to Apple for repair. I'm not impressed to say the least..."
3,Alright.,"It was a little more damaged than I expected, apparently ""scratches"" means the screen is essentially shattered. But it is still in good working order."
1,Item not as described,"My son saved his money to buy what was described as Apple 30 GB iPod with Video Playback (5th Generation). What arrived was an old severly scratched up ipod--not 5th generation, no video--with dried ""kuck"" on it. It was disgusting and we promptly sent it back."
3,"It's great, but...","The iPod's great and all, but now that the Zune is out, I'd 100% rather have the Zune than any iPod. Really disappointed seeing as I spent $279 on an iPod, when I could have waited and gotten a Zune for 20 bucks less, and I would have enjoyed SO much more. So if you're looking at getting an iPod, DON'T, look at the Zune!"
1,Terrible Purchase,"I just bought a brand new black video ipod last week. It sucks really bad because it dosent work with subscrition services, and it is a pain in the ass to get videos on. The black color smudges easily, and the only way to charge it is to plug it into your computor, unless you want to buy and dock fo 50$. Trust me, get a Zen Micro Photo, or even an iRiver H10. Way better than this waste of $300."
1,iPod works ok but iTunes is horrible!,"I've actually liked the iPod, but iTunes doesn't work well on a PC. It freezes up almost daily, crashes in the middle of downloads, gets stuck in iStore and I can't get out... the list goes on. I'm putting mine on eBay and getting something else! I'm sick of constant troubleshooting time wasted with no fix. I'm not exactly a ""dummy"" I have a masters in computer science!! But I don't have any more time to waste on this."
1,30 days and ipod doesn't work,"Make a long and dramatic story short. Bought am ipod 30 days ago, doesn't work, can't hear a thing, apple store can not help neither can customer service. They wont give me my money back because it's been longer than two weeks and wont exchange it. Stuck with a $250.00 mistake. My first product I purchased from apple and wont do it again. (This is no refelction of Amazon) If you buy it, enjoy the first fourteen days after that, your on your own."
1,apple 30 gb ipod video,"The ipod doesn't work. I talked with SERVICIOS Y VENTAS PC MAC- CALI, it is a Apple service authorized provider in Cali- Colombia. He send the guaranty request to apple and I am waiting for the new ipod but I don't feel good because it was the chrishtmas gift to my daughter."
3,Replaced a Defected Item,"Received a 30GB iPod with defective clickwheel, but didn't notice for a couple weeks because it was a Christmas gift for my dad. When I found out about the problem, I was worried that I had passed the seller's period of responsibility for replacement of the item. However, I asked for a repair or exchange, and the seller took back the item and replaced the click wheel no problem. Super easy and very responsive. Thanks!"
5,I Love the Ipod Video!!!!,"I was also 1 of the lucky people who got this 4 chrsitmas. The only thing i dont like about it is the downloading. it is very dificult to make the download go to the ipod. i managed to figure it out by right cliking copy. Check out my playlist:1. Don't Forget About Us- Mariah Carey2. Feel Good Inc.- Gorrilaz3. My Humps- Black Eyed Peas4. The Time Is Now- WWE John Cena & Tha Trademarc5. Run It!- Chris Brown6.

ShowsSuite Life of Zack and Cody: Christmas at the TiptonThat's So Raven: Taken to the CleanersThis music player is awesome, hope u like my playlist, tell me what u think about guys!"
1,doesnt work,1st time ordering A refurbished item and it doesnt work after spending 2 hours trying to find out how to return it alls you get is the run around BUY NEW OR NOT AT ALL
2,ipod,i retract what i wrote they are now working online with me to rectify the problem i hope this is satisfactory new this retraction was asked for by the people who sold me the defective ipod they stated they would be correcting the problem but as of sept 26 still have not heard from them one way or the other
1,LCD NOT covered under Apple Warranty,"This is from the Apple service website:If your iPod's LCD display is cracked due to accidental damage, do not send your iPod in for service. Coverage for this type of damage is excluded under Apple's Limited Warranty for iPod and AppleCare Protection Plan for iPod, and service is not available under the terms of Apple's Repair Terms and Conditions.We bought a nano. It lasted ~ 6 months and then the screen cracked. Is it worth the premium for this device when Apple doesn't warranty the LCDs?"
5,iLove iPod,"This item is amazing! Easy to use, lightweight and portable and worth every penny. I found it to be cheaper on amazon.com than anywhere else I've searched and I've looked for months."
4,Ipod vs. generic,"Besides the fact that its proven to be the best mp3 player, it plays movies, holds pictures....and so on. It is a pain to figure out how to get those items on an ipod. I wouldn't trade it for the generic brands. But it would be convenient to bypass all the junk to fill the ipod."
2,Died Frequently,"I first received the 30GB black iPod video in June of 2007. I had to replace it 1x,2x,3x,4x,5x.I am replacing my iPod tomorrow for the 5th time because even though I reinstalled the software and restored the iPod to its original settings, it refuses to sync.This is what happens when you outsource manufacturing to China. When things were made in America, they lasted!"
2,I'm sticking with my sony MD,"Everyone was saying that I was locked in the stone ages because I refused to lose my sony md and get an ipod.I finally purchased one and returned it within a week. It just isn't as versitile as my sony MD.The battery life is horrid, it doesn't even have a built in charger for the battery. Can't record live or from any source for that matter.Good thing that I stocked up on blank 1GB MDs because it doesn't look like I can find them anywhere anymore.Maybe when the ipod comes with a little more features (I can watch full length movies on my moto cell phone) and a better price (it is a money sink hole as someone else mentioned) maybe, just maybe I'll leave the flintstones and join the rest of the jetsons."
4,Great Product - just wish more compatible,"This is my second iPod, and just like the last one I think the product is great. My only problem is the compatiblity issue - I am a PC user and actually enjoy Windows and deal with linix form time to time - but Apple refuses to allow other products than iTunes to operator with this device (there are a few alternatives, but none thats just amazing). Even worseif you buy a song off iTunes your stuck using iTunes and the iPod - you can't transfer it to another brand MP3 player (although I've heard if you burn the songs to a cd as a standard music CD you can then rip them back as standard MP3 instead of AAC) SO overall I'ld rate this product as 4 stars for its amazing quality and 1 star for compatibility."
5,Cute!!,Cute & fit well. Easy adjusting. Love the pattern. Bought for my 5 lb Chorkie. It is made of non-irritating material.
1,Park elsewhere.,"Well folks, this ones a real stinker! J.K. Rowling was doing a book signing tour and this ""director"" took a home video camera to it and filmed people as they were waiting to see her. It's about 7.11 minutes of wasted tape.A much better choice would be ""Discovering the Real World of Harry Potter."" It's a British documentary made for American Public Television. Its shows some of the real life connections to the Harry Potter stories. It also talks about some of the places mentioned in the stories like King's Cross Station, Rowling's childhood home, and a school that's like Hogwarts. As for this parking lot, it would be best to just pave it over."
5,Classic movie,"I bought it for the residents at the nursing home. They love it. It's got all you could ask for in a movie: a star, good costumes, & musical numbers."
3,"Good content, poor transfer","This particular transfer printing was of poor quality. There were many pages where the words against the right margin were cut off and illegible. The other strange fact is the cover photo on the book has absolutely no relationship to the work. Did the publishing company have some extra book covers laying around that they offered at a discount? Fortunately a good portion of the architectural drawings and photos were in reasonable shape. For a transfer in this condition either they should cut the price considerably and mark these as ""seconds"" or the buyer should consider another printed option."
1,garbage,"I am about to leave on a long road trip. I am really late, but I was so angry at this ""machine"" that I decided to come back to the house and write this review. The cds jump all over the place. If you turn the machine off, instead of coming back to where you were (as the dozens of other mp3 players I have owned do), it starts at the beginning. The buttons are stiff, etc. I own hundreds of books on discs, so I keep buying old-style mp3 players, but I will never buy another craig product. I am also put out that SONY has cheapened its products, but that is another story."
2,This is not a production quality product...,"I got it from Amazon today and immmediately decided to return it. The firmware seems to be very buggy. I couldn't get it to recognize some of the CD's that I burnt with Roxio Toast on the Mac. Probably haveing problems with Joilet extension (long names). I also tried to play a slide show from a CompactFlash. Some of the pictures were displayed incorrectly. e.g. Lost of color channel information. Gaps in the pictures. Also I couldn't get XP to recognize the drive. I tried to find out whether there is a new version of the firmware. But addonics website has a broken link and I cannot download the ""new"" firmware. I have also tried the Apacer CP200 which is a similar product. While it has a few bugs I have none of the problems with Addonics. I am also returning the Apacer because I think these products are still immature. I'll stick with my laptop for the meantime."
1,Defective,It doesn't recognize my Memory stick cards. Both cards are working OK with my digital camera.
2,A big disappointment,"I'm a big fan of Jennifer Crusie's - I think Welcome to Temptation is one of the best romance novels ever - but this book really doesn't work, even allowing for the fact that it's rather dated. The plot is a mess and the characterisation is so unsubtle that after a while you want to scream: 'Okay, Jennifer, I got it! He's sexy but straightlaced, she's sexy but flaky ... you don't have to keep hammering the point home.' I was so bored with Strange Bedpersons that I found myself skipping bits of it -and I never thought I'd say that about a Crusie novel."
2,"Not Her Best, But O.K.","I'm a big fan of Crusie so I was suprised to find myself skimming through this book ready for it to be over. It wasn't that it was a bad read, I just couldn't seem to get attached to the characters. And there was so much past history between the characters I felt from the first page that I had already missed half of the book that wasn't even written. But Crusie's usual humor was definatly present for the ending and the reason I gave the two stars. My favorite read by Crusie is 'Welcome To Temtation'Great Book! I'd reacomed any of her books(except maybe this one)"
3,good sports bra,"this bra runs really small in the cups. i am a 36DDD usually the 36G is small in the cups, they are more like a C/D cup. on one of the bras the 36 in band is small and the other is is more of a 38in band. so there is no telling. i use this bra for yoga, beware though it has pointy boobs. i gave it 3 stars because it does function as a good sports bra even if i need two because the fabric is so flimsy."
1,THE WORST!!! What a waste of money.,"I expected (for the price) that this product would hurt (and it does) - but I expected it to WORK (which it doesn't).The product has a nice box (packaged well), comes with the 10 double-sided strips, and enough ""cleaning solution"" (to take the ""residue"" off your skin) to clean a CHILD'S FINGERNAIL!!! You wind up using the entire bottle to clean off the junk left on your skin from ONE strip!!! Wound up trying to improvise a solution (baby oil, soap, etc.) to clean off the residue left from the next 3 strips I used.The end result: SOME hair was removed, tons of residue left on my skin, huge red marks, PAINFUL...I would've gotten BETTER results from using wide-strip PACKING TAPE! (Come to think of it, why didn't I just do that to begin with? Probably would've gotten better results - and saved some money.)Spend the extra bucks and get something better. This product was the worst."
3,It gets better as it goes,"Having backpacked through Asia and being a woman who likes to read mysteries with female protagonists and romantic subplots, I thought I'd try this. I almost stopped reading it after the first few chapters -- the main character, Tansy, was not someone I was interested in reading more about and I found her characterizations of Asia annoying. But I stuck with it and it got much better as Tansy's character grew. It was worth the read, but not worth buying."
4,"slow start, but gets off the ground eventually","I also hated Tansy when I started this book- I may have even skimmed to the end if not for my incredibly boring summer job. Now I'm glad I didn't skim it, because I really became absorbed in the story- Tansy changes for the better- and even before she changes, the self-depricating humor starts to grow on the reader. I liked that there was more to the story than the typical girl meets boy plot. And for those of you who like to travel, Backpack will make you want to just pick up and leave (and I don't just think that because of my incredbly boring job)."
4,A good place to start,"The good thing about this book is that it lays out a very rational plan for speed improvement with pre-testing and needs evaluation. The organization of the workouts is a little complicated, though, leaving the reader to constantly refer to separate tables in different parts of the book. Some of the form exercises are pretty dated as well."
2,A Little Disappointed,"I love yoga and I like Denise Austin, so I thought this was a no brainer. Unfortunately, I found this program boring and unsatisfying. I don't feel like I get much of a workout from it, and it feels disjointed. It doesn't have the smooth flow you expect from a yoga workout. I would recommend other Denise Austin workouts, but not this one."
4,School time fun!,"Great gift for any child who loves to play school. Has all the stuff a teacher would have. A hit with my three kids and the older neighbor ones, as well."
4,pretend school set,My granddaughter loved it but I would suggest that a better desgn would help it stand up by itself better.
4,Child Teachers will enjoy!,"My seven year old daughter wanted this ""teacher toy"" for Christmas. She has always enjoyed playing teacher. She does not play with it every day, but will be playing with it for a long time to come. I payed a low price for this toy, which made it more than worth the money. My daughter wanted it NO MATTER THE PRICE, of course! It was exactly what she wanted."
5,My daughter is 9 and still enjoyed this!,My daughter wanted a school set that was out. I ordered this one with hesitation because it said 3+ and she is 9. She still enjoys it. Definitely recommend. Durable and easy to store.
5,My 6yr old Neice LOVES IT,I bought this for as a gift for my 6yr old neice and she loves it! She loves to play pretend school so this was perfect for her :)
4,Super item -- flawed packaging,"Precious, precious item. My 9 year old daughter just loves it. It might seem young for a girl this age, but she loves to play school, and she loves having all the ""tricky"" things right there together in one package. A sweet toy. One problem: Seller did not include the markers in the package! List of items included clearly says ""markers,"" but the markers did not make it into the package. Oh well. These are easy enough to replace. We were unable to get this package before Christmas as item was out of stock. Even when we ordered it after Christmas, our ship date was listed as some time in March. Surprise! Product arrived before January 1! Grandparents, for a young girl this would be a wonderful, fun gift. (Although stay under the age of 8 to be on the safe side--my daughter is young for her age.)"
5,So much fun!,"My 5 year old has LOVED playing with this since she got it for Christmas. The set up is like a ""real"" classroom with a calendar, clock, map, weather map, etc. It folds up nicely with a pocket to hold the small pieces, so it can be easily put away or taken along on an outing. The bell (to get everyone's attention!) and the pointer are a big hit."
4,learning resources pretend,my 5 year old loved this gift. one of her favorites. she loves being the teacher to her parents and older siblings:) everyone plays along.
4,Great for a 4 year old!,My four-year-old niece loves her play school set. She enjoys playing teacher. It's perfect for helping her adjust to preschool. This set has kept her busy.
5,Great gift,"Gave this to my 5-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. She really enjoys ""pretend school"", this was a big hit. It folds up into a nice case so it all packs up easily and stays neat and all together."
1,Junk,Absolute junk. Can't get the plastic parts together. Don't bother. I tried two different kits & it leaked anyway.
5,Perfect Wedding Ceremony Music,"This CD was exactly what we were looking for when we were searching for wedding ceremony music. We wanted something simple for our outdoor wedding ceremony last Fall and this fit the bill perfectly. The music is excellent and very well played by Maestro Jerard. We used 3 songs from the 2nd disc for our ceremony which included seating of the grandparents, parents, wedding party, etc.If you're looking for pretty guitar music for your ceremony then we'd highly recommend this set. It included 2 discs and over 120 minutes of music."
1,Bought it for the steering wheel,"My teen daughter thinks game is so lame, she's surprized it didn't show up on the annual list of the 25 Worst Wii Games. The premise is ridiculus, the graphics are bad. The only redeeming quality is that it came with a steering wheel that we hope can be used with other games, if it can't then there IS no redeeming feature for this game."
1,One of the worst movies ever!,"Unbelievably awful. Don't be fooled-the ghoulies are hardly in the movie. And when they finally show up for about one minute, it's just sad. The ghoulie effects are pathetic. Avoid at all costs!"
5,We're Going On a Bear Hunt,This book is a must to have in a toddler's library. A wonderful read aloud book. I have purchased it for my grandchildren and just purchased a copy for my great-grandchild.
2,Going on a Bear Hunt,I expected the original wording for this preschool classic. My error for not checking further so just a heads up for anyone else.
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!,I bought this book for my one year old nephew and the pages were UPSIDE DOWN AND BACKWARDS... I purchased A NEW BOOK... no where did it say it would be backwards AND upside down.. WHO would give that as a present??? Tried to contact seller for return info and they HAVE NOT REPLIED... I BOUGHT 2 BOOKS FROM HIM AND BOTH WERE HORRIBLE... I AM OUT THE MONEY AND I HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY NEW BOOKS FOR MY NEPHEW..... WILL NEVER BUY FROM THEM AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
