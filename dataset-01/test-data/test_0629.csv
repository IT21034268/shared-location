5,Great Insightful Story,Recommended reading for Australians of any age. A disturbing and thought-provoking expos√© of the real aftermath of war for our Vietnam vets and their families.
1,Buyer Beware!,"The picture does not represent the product. Kazoo Toys is practicing false advertising. You are purchasing the numbers product only - which is actually not pictured anywhere on this page!If you want numbers only, the product is fine, but definitely purchase from someone other than Kazoo Toys - a very unethical merchant."
1,Good luck dealing with this company,"I had the 1st Joe Blow pump from Topeak, bought by my wife without research. Does Schrader valves just fine, but balks on Prestas. I never had a Presta bike until recently, with my JoeBlow Sport pump just out-of-warranty. I got no action on the Presta from the Topeak/Todson pump, so called Todson to see about redress and they said no. Gotta pay for replacement parts (to fix their error!) I'd have to pay!Of course there are 100s of other people online, I now know, who've had the same problem due to poor mfg and/or design. But this company attitude is contemptible. My own company Makes Good if we accidentally foist something on a customer, no matter how out of date the warranty ! Everybody makes mistakes, of course. The test is in the Make-Good, and this company fails, utterly. I would never go near them for any product, and suggest you avoid them as well."
3,Topeak Road Morph pump,"Pros: comes with an air gaugeCons: too bulky for my road bikeI bought this pump after I was out on a long ride and experienced two tube failures. I only carry two CO2 cartridges and soon found myself with less than manageable inflation due to a failure of the CO2 cartridge head. I liked the idea of an integrated gauge on the Topeak, so I bought it.When I tried to mount it to my Specialized Grand Sequoia road bike, I found I did not like the mounting options and the seeming bulk of this pump. I returned it and bought a lower profile pump without the gauge."
1,I never used it,I couldn't get it to work because it came missing items. It would be great if they can exchange it for me for something that works on my road bike.
2,Might work if you're using it for a child's bike,"I tried using this to air up my tires when I got it in as a test, and the pressure needed to air up my adult bike's hybrid tires literally blew the nozzle off the bike valve. 3 times in a row.If you have a really low pressure tire like a child's tire, it might work."
3,Best one I know,Pressure started leaking back through the pump after about 3 years which is a worthy lifetime but perhaps no more than 30 inflations. I would usually inflate to 120 lbs which put more pressure on the pump than another tire might. Don't know of a better one.
2,"A Good Start, but Not Enough","While I enjoyed the book, I kept wishing that there was moresubstance to the story. I would have liked for the characters to have been develped more in-depth. It was an easy and quick read, but when I finished I thought that overall it was more like a generalization of a story rather than a detailed storyline. There was not much attention to detail, other than the descriptions of dirt, fertilizer, and plants. I would have enjoyed the book more if I felt like I knew the characters better. I would definitely wait for the paperback edition, and not recommend paying the hardback price."
2,Are you kidding!?!?!,Are you kidding!? I've had this thing for several days and I haven't got it set up yet! I am having a lot of trouble with this one. Thinking of returning it.
4,Uniden Scanner,Received scanner in good working order. The package was received within a week of ordering.
1,Scanner won't scan,"I messed around with it for hours until I realized it doesn't scan frequencies unless you hold the scan button down. Maybe mine was faulty, but I couldn't find anything in the instructions to indicate it scans without holding the button down. I e-mailed Uniden about the problem, and the company didn't reply. So I sent it back. A scanner that won't scan is virtually worthless."
1,Doesn't work!,The radio and weather radio work ok but the scanner does not work. The scanner is the reason that I purchased it. Of course the doesn't even work!Joe Bayless
5,so far so good,"I had a Uniden handheld unit with lots of frequencies programmed in - seldom heard anything. I got this desktop unit and wow...all the difference in the World. Chatter all the time. Now I know what's going on in my locality. Police, school buses, transit buses, local airport, ambulances, gas and electric companies, streets departments, animal control, prisons, ham operators and of course the weather. And I still have lots of space for more frequencies.I got it because I was jealous going to friends and neighbors and their scanners going off now and then, but this unit makes theirs look sick."
1,Junk,First off it took forever to get this item. Then when it finaly arrived it turned out to be a piece of junk. It would'nt program and other features didn't work.
4,Good scanner for the price,"I've had the Uniden 100 channel scanner about a month and a half. It has been my first scanner. I primarily have it set for my city's police broadcasts and listen to it while I'm reading or doing other projects. It's been informative to have that information and entertaining as well. I haven't had any problems with it in the time that I've had this scanner. The only thing I was a little disappointed about was that I didn't seem to be able to pick up any other types of scans besides police traffic when I tried to let it scan for things like air traffic, medical helicopter, etc. However, I'm not ruling out that in this day and age perhaps those channels are blocked or perhaps the area I live in doesn't have reception, but I didn't have any luck finding other types of scanning to listen to. Although I have enjoyed being able to get the police scanning on this scanner and I feel safer that I have that information accessible."
2,The scanner doesn't work,I bought because of the scanner and it does work same your money . The radio it's bad and the alarm too
4,"Dogs love 'em, they're just too darn pricey!","My dog goes crazy for these treats. Since they are soft, I can easily break them into smaller pieces, perfect for training. Buffalo Bites have enough of a pungent odor to attract my dog, but they're not so stinky that my hands smell bad after feeding. Since they are made with buffalo meat, they should work for dogs allergic to other protein sources or otherwise require a limited ingredient diet. I just wish they weren't quite so expensive!"
2,I'd look elsewhere!,"The plus sides to this vcr in my opinion is size(small) and lightweight. You get a clear picture when a video is in. Other than that, I wasn't happy with it. There is no clock, the control is pretty cheap. I still can't find the pause button, if it even has that feature. Didn't find the manual very informative either. Well I plugged the tv antenna to the vcr, and know it looks worse. Everytime I wanna put the movie on pause, I got to turn it off. If it's up to me, I tell you get your money and spend a little bit more on another model. It will be worth it. Everything about the vcr is very confusing. Goodluck on your purchase."
5,Great Deal..,"I wish I had bought 2... This is a great deal.. This is the 5th VCR I have bought in the last 15 years and is by far the best. All missing features, compared to higher priced VCR's, are not needed. One touch recording, auto tracking, timer, are simple to use. 4 Head picture is great. My advice.. get 2.. hook em and do some dubbing.. or just get a 2nd one for the basement. High quality, low price.."
5,Incredible.,"Simply put, incredible graphics and realism. No fighter to date has been as detailed. A must buy!"
4,4 for GRAPHICS...3.5 stars really,"The Graphics alone deserve a 4.5 stars or 5 stars at least. But rating the ENTIRE GAME GETS A 3.5 stars. The actuall game play (button configuration, movements in environments, the fighting style is pretty good/decent,etc.) But it does get a LITTLE REPETITIVE and the STORY LINE is a little SHAKEY. If you are a DIE HARE DOA fan you should buy it. If you like the DOA series I'd say rent it or try it out for an hour at a friends house or on a demo and then decide if you want to BUY IT or NOT. Once you beat the game with everyone (which does'nt take too long) there is nothing much more to do except play a few more times or with a friend."
1,Worst Fighting Game Ever,"I am so happy I decided not to buy this game, this game is horrible. Yeah sure it has good graphics and stuff but after you beat the whole game it becomes extremely boring. It only takes a few hours to beat the game with everybody. There are no hidden characters. I wanted to give a 0.5 rating but i couldn't. I strongly suggest you rent this game first. This is the worst fighting game ever!"
1,Not for the ladies...,"This one might offend some women, either who plan on playing or watching the game being played. Dubed ""the bounciest fighter around"", this game uses sex appeal to reach into the wallets or teens and young adults. Just don't let your girlfriend see what you've been playing...."
4,A solid title,I bought this game when the Xbox was first released and it hasn't disappointed yet. I still play it a few times a week. The graphics are awesome and the controls are pretty much flawless. Combos are pulled off easily and the extra modes provide variety. The stages and characters look amazing. I'll save my 5 stars for HALO but if you need a fighting game you can't go wrong with this. Tag mode with 4 players rocks!
2,"Great potential, horrible execution...","The graphics, gameplay, and framerate are unbelievable. The backgrounds are fantastic. However the most important part of the game, the characters, are so incredibly boring. None have any personality or anything that keeps your interest. I like female fighters, and I definitely love and respect women, but there are way too many women fighters in this game. There just isn't anyone worth playing with and it takes away from the fun of the overall game. They need to take a page from Capcom and learn how to develop characters you want to play with and not boring cookie-cutter players. If you exclude the players, you have a great game with a great game engine. If you like the characters, all of which were from earlier games from what I'm told, you'll enjoy the game. If you don't, then definitely pass on it. I wish I had."
5,Awesome,"Whether you just want a few minutes of fun, or are looking for hours of intense gameplay, this is the beat-em-up game you want to get. Graphics are fantastic, moves are plentiful, and gameplay is rewarding.This is actually the first xBox game I ever played. This has been a while ago. It certainly was the game that made me buy this console (well, alright, I would have probably bought it no matter what...)"
5,Definitely Alive (and Kicking),"The best 3-D fighting game I have ever played. The graphics are superior to any fighting game for any other platform or in the arcade. There are may fighting styles and charcters to choose from. These range from Ninjitsu, pro-wrestling and even drunken boxing. The variety of charcters and special moves makes this fighting game exceptional.The CGI movies are incredible."
1,If you want to finish a game in an hour or two...THIS IS IT!,"Poor at best. It was enjoyable while it lasted, but it didn't last!"
1,Just Plain Bad,"For starters, the game is in half English and half Japanese. When a character speaks it is subtitled yet the announcements ""You Win"" etc., are in English. Sorry, but that is just stupid.The story mode is utterly pathetic. I don't even know why it is there.When it comes to game play, this is strictly a button mashing player vs. player game. My three year old can put up a good fight if her fingers don't get tired.All said. This game had potential but it looks like the developers were in a rush to get it out of the door. Don't buy unless you think that your three year old may enjoy it."
5,Laptop AC Adapter,I found that it works really good and it is what I was needing the shiping was great got it on time over all it is a good product
1,"so suck , I pay for it and they do not shipping for me any thing","so suck , I pay for it and they do not shipping for me any thing"
4,Durable,"I am an industrial electrician and a mag light is metal. This plastic light I can lay and drop almost anywhere. The beam is fixed but is a good beam for just about everything. It is good for about 100 + feet.The bad is that if you set it down on the lens cap it makes a good seal and you can't see any light, thus you leave it on."
3,"Good game, but..... not really earthshattering","I read all the rave reviews and was really looking forward to this game. I like good driving games and I like shooters so I figured I would really enjoy this game. Two main complaints:1)Too much like the Driver games for Playstation (I though GTA3 would be a bigger departure) In some ways the driving in the first Driver game was better than this game.2)The violence left me feeling empty. I have nothing against violent games as long as there is a purpose to it. This game's premise just didn't cut it for me.Bottom line, if you like the Driver games you will love this game. If you like playing a thug/gangster and beating and shooting people for no reason get this game."
5,Great game,"This is a great game for people 13 and up, It has everything. It has no loading time except at the begining, excellent graphics, good controls. One of my favorite things about GTA 3 is that u can go anywhere, its so free. It has realistic A.I. too."
5,Probably the best game on PS2.,"When I first got this game,I was completely amazed.I had never played a game like this in my life.I mean,it's got everything,hookers,blood,guns,gangs,flame throwers,its all in this game.At first i thought this wasn't any fun,since i couldn't figure it out.But once i figured it out,this game became one of the greatest games of all time.You can even beat the people up and take their money.Its great.The first few missions are very easy.But as the game goes on,the missions become a lot more difficult.I think the most funnest mission on this game was the car bomb mission.I seriously can't wait to get Vice City(I don't have it yet,but I'll get it sooner or later).If you own a PS2 and you don't have this game,something is desperately wrong with you.If you have a PS2,make sure you get this game."
3,playability problems,"I am not an avid gamer of this series, this is my first gta, I got one because my son has several of them and I was shown the games in action by him.I like the game, but playability is a problem when it comes to timed missions,too much traffic, too slow vehicles, city map on screen too small,and some of these missions are quite tedious and take too long, but then they don't give you enough time to complete them with all the traffic, bad maps,slow vehicles, etc.I much prefer the midnight club series to thesew gta,s."
1,Awful game,"Why is this game even made it is disgusting and games like this should not be made, it always ends up in the hands of children, what is this world coming to morally?"
1,This game is sadistic,OKay I can see how this game is fun... but how can you put in (...) prostitutes and such an absurd amount of foul language!!!!! I mean Perfect Dark is a good amount of violence to have a good time... and I can see how fun it could be to have simulation chases and stuff.. but this game is going WAY too far.
3,Good for guys and teenagers. Duh...,I don't know. I just thought running over people would be more fun than it actually is.
3,Hard to describe!!,"I would vociferate this game as extremely irritating. The Radio songs are repetitive.The AI is stupid. The Radar is so darn small, your eyes start to sore. Most of the vehicles are Taxis and trucks.Getting from one island to another is frustrating. Overall speaking, this game is for those who have ample time to spare and do not get easily irritated. Most of the missions are epigrammatic, and gang members get angry at you on inconcequential issues.Its an extremely strenous task to find ammo.Well thats all I have to say.I would this game no more than 3 stars.Rockstar Games has to come out with something worthy. Theyre way better than this!!"
5,The Single Greatest Game EVER,"One might consider myself a video game conisseur. I have played virtually every video game from Duck Hunt to Luigi's Mansion, i even owned the ill-fated SEGA CD and 64-bit Jaguar systems, and I can honestly say that Grand Theft Auto III is the most addictive, most realistic and more importantly, the most fun game that I have EVER PLAYED!! Not only is this game a great stress/anger reliever, but it it so addictive that instead of releasing energy on the poor cops and pedestrians in the game, you outright forget about whatever managed to bug you in the first place. I must say one slightly negative thing, this game DESERVES ITS RATING and there are some people so sick in the head or so young that they should be cutoff from this game entirely."
4,Let me catch my breath...,"Oh my Lord!!! What an amazingly violent, senseless, EXTREMELY COOL game! You know how you have those days where you wish that you could've killed that guy that cut you off on the Interstate? Well, come home, play this, and vent. Everything that you can't do in the real world you can do here: steal cars, outrun the cops, work for guys named Vinny! And that's just the tip of the iceberg! The graphics are good-not Final Fantasy good, but good nonetheless. Just make sure a child under 12 doesn't get his hands on this, for he will probably be scarred for life. Overall, a fun ride, just take a break every once in a while, otherwise it loses its appeal."
5,This game is intense!!,"From baseball bats to sub-machine guns. This game incompasses all that is evil in the complicated mind of man. In this game you can do anything you want literally. You become a hitman for the mafia, stealing cars is a regular practice as if there was no other way to get around. Prostitution is used in the game to increase your health like it is an antibiotic for the soul. In conclusion I must say that this game is to say the least an outlet for anger and could possible cause the downfall of man kind as we know it. But it is my favorite."
5,WOW!,THIS GAME IS VERY COOL. COMON PEOPLE WHATS NOT FUN ABOUT STEALING CARS AND LITERATLY DOING WHATEVER YOU WANT WITH THEM?????????????NOTHINGITS A MUST BUY TRUST ME BUY IT!
4,GTA3 was meant 4ME,"Man, this game is da bomb baby. Nothing like hittin' up on hookers and sniping pigs between the eyes. Just like I've always wanted to in real li...er....nevermind. The graphics are tight, though the slowdown sucks a little. The sound is good and the story looks interesting so far. Overall, it's pretty tight."
5,May be BEST game ever made.,This is a terrific and very addicting game. Rockstar put an unbelieve amount of time into this game. It is truely one of the best. Loads of fun and can never get old. A great game for anyone 17 or older.
5,"OH, MY GOD. THIS GAME IS A DREAM COME TRUE","I just bought this game. It is a dream come true. The graphics rock,the plot can be stupid but mostly it's good. It's not so hard that your still on the first level after playing it for a week. Some parts can be gory but it does't bother me. If you want a good driving no holds bared game. This game's for you."
1,Did not work,"This item didn't work after we waited for over 2 weeks to get it!! So upset, it was suppose to be in very good condition!!!"
4,"ahhhh, nothing like AK-47 fire in the mornin","GTA 3 is a pretty good game, some of the missions are mindless, I find the game camera horrible, but it is senseless digital violence almost at it's best, and if you are in to that, get this..if not, go trade Pokemon cards with your friends!!"
3,its ok...but its missing a lot,"i got this game when it originally came out and it was a good time, i had a blast with the free roaming ability, however there are things that get tiresome and more noticeable especially after playing vice city and san andreas - negatives to me are: repetitive soundtrack after awhile, character has no personality, the twist in the middle of the game that makes you change allegiances, the mission to kill a certain mafia boss that forces you to be precise with a one bullet sniper shot otherwise ur dead takes the fun out of the mission...i should be able to stand on the corner and just blaze with armor on and see what happens using my machine gun and grenades, the handling of the cars is rough at times and they blow up too easily...i could go on, but the story just doesn't impress me...its a lot of fun to roam but the story does little to make me want to continue pass the plot twist"
5,RIDICULOUSLY GROUNBREAKING!!!,"99% OF THE TIME, VIDEO GAMES BASED ON THE SAME ""OL MODEL"" OF GAME MAKING, AND WE JUDGE HOW GOOD THE GRAPHICS, GAMEPLAY, ""REALNESS"", ETC...COME OFF, THEN COMES ALONG A GAME THAT INTRODUCES A WHOLE NEW WAY OF GAMEPLAY, WELL A NEW CHAPTER IN VIDEO GAME MAKING HAS BEGUN HERE!!!"
2,Don't see what all the hype is about.,"Every review I read says this is a great game, so naturally, I was excited about getting it. Big disappointment! First of all, the graphics are just average - I've seen much better on the PS2 (Onimusha, GTA3, Silent Hill 2). The cut scenes are laughable. The whole game has a cartoon feel to it, and is not very realistic. Which brings me to the violence factor. Everyone says this game is ultra-violent, but given the fact that the game just looks like a bad cartoon, I don't think the violence has much effect. Yes, you shoot people, carjack autos, pick up hookers, etc., but so what? After you do it for 30 minutes, you get bored.I think the biggest problem with this game is the gameplay. You drive around town looking for jobs to do, and much of it ends up to be just monotonous.All in all, I think this game is much ado about nothing."
3,"Good, but way too overrated.!","I enjoy this game somewhat,but c'mon it's not the best game by any means. I mean I hate people who like it just because they can go around beat some people up and steal some cars, and then say, ""it's a really good game ,and I'll look cool playing this game with my friends"". So please, some of you people, first, actually play the real game and then write a review. Maybe you'll find this game actually has a story."
5,This game is the bomb!,When I first bought this game I thought it would be dumb... But boy was I wrong. This is the best game ever made. Buy it but keep it away from little kids because of violence and foul languge.
5,A MUST HAVE GAME FOR PS2!!!!!,ANY GAME WHERE YOU COULD YANK SOMEONE OUT OF THEIR CAR AND BEAT'EM DOWN WITH A BAT IS A MUST HAVE IN MY GAME LIBRARY!!!!THIS GAME IS SO REALISTIC THAT I COULD NOT BELIEVE MY EYES.MUCH IMPROVED OVER THE ORIGINAL PS VERSION.GET THIS GAME BEFORE IT DISAPEARS OF THE SHELVES. :O SAY IT AINT SO....
2,Don't believe the HYPE,"This game was a huge disappointment and is not nearly as wonderful as the reviews on this site allude to. Despite the violence and depravity this game panders to, the game play and the graphics are mediocre. The best playstaion one game I ever player was Driver 2, and I still have yet to find a mission-based racing game that beats that standard. This game even being produced on a ""next generation system"" doesn't match up. If you want some real racing fun, rent Driver 2 or buy it for much less than you will waste on this over hyped, unrealistic farce."
3,Content,I understand the nature of this game however it is very graphic. Surprises me what passes for entertainment these days.
5,A Very Emotional Story,"Bret Has Been My Role Model & Fav. Since 1990. The guy is a hero to me. Shawn is a great wrestler and performer. We all know about this rivalry if you watch WWE back in the 90s. Anything regarding Bret, I usually purchase and I just finish watching the 1st disc of this DVD and it was very emotional. It put tears into my eyes. To see what Bret had to go through and what Shawn had to do for the business. I already know how great the matches are. I definitely recommend this DVD to anyone !!!"
5,both wrestlers and jr skip something that happend,"well this is the best wwe dvd ever in my opinion and i agree with everybody posting here but i notice that both wrestlers shawn and bret and jr skip somethings that happend for example both wrestlers they never talk about the fight they had in the locker room when shawn talk about sunny days and bret confront shawn in the locker about that and thats when both had a scuffle and bret manage to pull some hair of shawn michaels and bret saying i got precious hair of shawn michaels in my hand this was told by bret in his book and also another thing they skip is if bret really had sex with sunny jr skip that knowing the talk was about sunny but jr skip that question, another question skip is why shawn never let jose lotario enter the ring to celebrate his victory in mania 12 also i discover that both shawn and bret lie about some questions but despite that is a 5 star dvd i recommend it"
4,Hitman vs HBK,I thought this was a pretty decent release by the WWE and something any longtime fan would enjoy. I was interested in hearing the story of the Montreal incident from both Bret and Shawn. Another thing I was interested in was the ladder match for the IC belt in 92. Great match and the best part of this set. My only gripes are that I wish the main feature wouldve gone on a little longer. They couldve added a few more subjects to discuss. Also including the iron man match is a waste since most anyone buying this probably has the other Bret and Shawn releases. Overall though it's a good set to add to your collection.
4,nice smal form factor and simple controls.,"appearance + controls:Very tiny voice recorder.the buttons are at the right places to allow easy one hand operation.nice cradle. but would like the ability to charge unit via the usb cable.nimh rechargeable battery included--nice touch.voice recording:ok recording from the back of a lecture hall (20 rows fr the front).software:need to download vista update from panasonic; otherwise, included cdrom doesn't support vista.the voice recognition function is a joke. took a long time... and it isn't even accurate."
3,"Does the job, but could do better","I have had to use this pump a few times in the three or so months I have owned it. I like my long barrel pump that goes under the top tube, much better even though it operates laterally rather than vertically like this one. Seems like it takes more effort to keep this pump vertically balanced which takes away from the effectiveness of the full downward stroke. This isn't specific to just this pump, since it is more of a design issue. The size of the barrel is also half that of my top tube pump, so its only half as effective per stroke even without the balancing act."
1,phone case,Bargaincell- Brand New Sprint Sanyo SCP-6600 Katana Solid Black Crystal Snap On Cover Case with Belt ClipThe case scratches easily and looked worn within a few weeks. Total waste of money.
3,A little disappointing,"This album sounds like any other mainstream alt rock college group....all of the songs are okay, but none are really stand outs in my mind. They have essentially lost all of their latin rock roots that they had on their last album Tarantism. I miss the sounds from songs like After Dark, and Angry Cockroaches, that help set the tone of Dusk til Dawn. The only latin song on this album is ""La Flor De Mal"", which unfortunately is a little bit cheesy for my liking."
4,"Like fine wine, getting better with age.","I suppose the above reference to ""Latin Rock"" reflects the fact that Larrivia is of Hispanic background and does sing a song (the bonus track) in Spanish. However, I consider Andalucia to basically be straight ahead, dark-natured, American rock. That said, this album is their most consistent to date---with more grunge nuances. Ultimately, if you don't have a Tito & Tarantula album, get this first (although all their albums are worth having). Highlights, IMO, are IT'S MY MISTAKE, YOU'RE THE ONE I LOVE, TORN TO PIECES, BULLETS FROM A GUN, IN BETWEEN, AND MEXICAN SKY. Finally, for crying out loud, spread the gospel of Tito!!! I can't understand why Larrivia isn't a household name yet. 20 year career, 25+ very good songs. I'll leave it to the fickle, fame Gods to figure out."
4,Great purchase,"I bought 15 of these water bottles for some of my green interns, and they are loving them. The only issue I had was with the packaging (lots of plastic wrap around each bottle- seems counter intuitive for a eco friendly product), but otherwise, I was very happy with the purchase and order."
2,Didn't Last,"I purchased this bottle in September and loved it at first. I took it everywhere with me. The only problem at first was that I got lazy and didn't screw it on totally so I wouldn't have to unscrew it to take a drink and found myself with leaks in bags, etc. So, now after a couple of months, I have found that screwing it on and off every time I want a drink has worn the threads on the cap. It no longer holds tightly. I won't buy another of this brand. I need something easier to drink from and more reliable."
2,Okay but not fabulous...,If you are looking for a cheap and *very* light use bottle... this one works. If you are looking for a quality workhorse bottle... this is NOT it.The quality of the screw cap ring is bad. There aren't enough threads to really get the top on tight. It either spins or leaks slightly.The tinted paint layer is thin and does chip/scratch pretty easy with typical use.They are made in China if that is a concern for you.Save your money and buy a Sigg bottle for the same kind of bottle but much higher quality. Or a Klean Kanteen. I own both and they are 10x the water bottle. I have four children under the age of 8 that used these bottles and they just don't really hold up like the Sigg or Klean Kanteen.
1,Made in China...no wonder it's so cheap! And flimsy too!,"If avoiding Chinese-made products is important to you, skip this cheap Chinese import. This is a ""US"" company --yea, right! SIGG is the only socially conscious choice right now."
2,exterior quality poor,"New Wave bottle does a good job inside; but in the dishwasher, even on the highest shelf, the paint on the bottle chips off after a second washing. Wouldn't recommend this product, for that reason."
1,Unlikely food-grade steel,"I can repeat about the design mistake with the thread size/depth, which is not sufficient for the soft plastic material of the cap. However, I was more surprised when I have found it is magnetic, not as pure iron, but quite detectably. Steel 304 in not magnetic, but the package claims it is made of it. Thus, it is more likely the bottle is made of some version of 4** steel, being a few times cheaper, of some another lower-price iron alloy. Not-304 steel would explain some ""metallic"" taste some reviews mentioned. Thus, it is likely one more ""falsified"" product. Let's just help the metal does not release some poison."
3,Broken,"Deceptive ad to the max, we don't care to have discription in metric. Makes product seem larger than it is. Also cap to bottle broken with no contact info in package to replace. Better off buying a stainless bottle at Albertsons or Vons."
3,Flimsy Stainless Steel Water Bottle,The bottles did not have a substantial feel that I anticipated they would. They are light and flimsy (not only the bottle but also the attached spring link) and I suspect will not hold up well to travel abuse. Probably will do their duty for the short term but by the feel will not be a long term investment.
4,Great Quality,"Great quality product compared to others out there. One measurement they fail to provide though is the actual depth of the can. The depth documented is that of the track. If you add on the setback and the little handle on the front using the numbers provided you may not have space. The track needs 20"" as documented the can only needs 17"". For my install that made all the difference with the sink drain. If this product will fit in your situation you will be happy with it."
2,fair product,This product is sturdy enough but doesn't pull out far enough. If you have a full bag of trash there is no way to get the bag out without spilling trash. If you are happy wasting garbage bags this item is for you.
5,Great under sink or cabinet trash can,"Well made, easy to install and the pull out tray works great. The 30 gallon can is the perfect size."
5,An awesome trash can!,"This thing is perfect! It looks great (at least in our black/red and stainless steel kitchen) and works great! Very smooth rollers, perfect size can - trash bags fit snug around the perimeter and we were lucky that the dimensions of our under-sink space were just right. Make sure you measure the space well first. We have a garbage disposal under the sink and the trash can fit just right next to it. 1/2 of an inch would've made it impossible to fit this thing in there. Construction is solid and sturdy. Highly recommend!"
2,"Fantastic... if you have patience, which I don't.","""IMPORTANT: DO NOT INSERT THE BUCKET FRAME INTO THE WELDED TRACK UNTIL THE LAST STEP""...well thanks for shipping it to me like that.It seems like a pretty great garbage can, and I won't be returning it thanks to the hour I've invested in getting 2/8 screws in, but for the price I'm sure you can do better..."
3,"Dress shoe, not to be worn outside the office",Decent dress shoe for carpeted office use. Makes a clack-clack sound when walking in a concrete garage as if I was wearing high-heels. Super-slick leather sole with no grip; slipped and almost fell in a retail shop that had tile floors.
3,Brass Boot Men's Evan Slip-on,Fits good and is very comfortable. Have been look for a slip on that did not have a thick sole and european square toe.
2,Too expensive for what you get.,"This was dissapointing when it came. It came in a plain plastic bag, and looked like it was worth about 1/2 of what I paid for it. I thought is this all there is?? I also bought a Melissa and Doug stamp set and was really happy with that one. I only gave it 2 stars because I thought it was way over priced, and plain looking. It was a gift and it just didn't measure up."
4,"A little superhuman, but wonderful advice","Overall I love the information presented in this book. It's not fascist or self hating, but holistic and comes from a very positive place. There is simply no way I'm going to give up my morning coffee, but I've implemented some of the advice (vitamins, drinking less juice, avoiding sugar as much as possible, maybe getting that shower filter when I have a moment) that is keeping my tummy a little trimmer with a lot less effort and my nails stronger. In addition I love her approach to beauty, not a fear driven approach, but very positive, embracing who you truly are. Incidentally, I've seen a lot of her claims backed up in other health and beauty articles I've read. Also, and most importantly, for people suffering from stomach issues, a lot of this advice prevents inflammation and irritation."
4,A very promising start from a superb artist,"I really love Mary Beth's music and this debut album showed the kind of huge potential that she is now realising. Although it doesn't quite touch you in the same way as some of the stuff from ""Supernatural"" or ""More perfect world"" it does allow an insight into Mary Beth at the start of her career and is a very enjoyable album. It's just a shame that not more people know of this great talent!"
3,Really Something/Destroy,"Everybody was looking for ""Destroy"". It's the second half of ""Really Something"". that's why the song is called ""Really Something/Destroy"".the CD was good, in my opinion. i luuuuurve ""Bratcore"". i got it free from amazon.com. warning: preview before you buy. most people won't like this CD if they don't like dance music, so put it down, walk away, or sell it if you hate it. don't trash it. just say you didn't like it and move one. no, i'm not being hatefull to anyone, so don't send me hate-mail. LOL"
5,Laser line,I mounted the Laser Line guide on my Miter saw. The product is great and met my expectations. It was easy to mount and adjust. The Laser line is very bright and works well in the light. I am very happy with this product.
4,Nice basics,Very helpful presentation. It gives stronger base rooting in using Chakra healing. Worth considering in expanding your world in positive light.
1,Pretty but....,The product is pretty but is not deep enough for ice cubes. They fall out before you can get them into the cup.
2,4 ounce SS scoop,I have been an Amazon customer for awhile always happy . I expected the scoop to be heavier as picture looked to me . The Ice tongs were great quality and love the ice bucket. The scoop looks like it would bend pushing it into a bag of ice .Edges on handle are uncomfortable and a little sharp . Very unhappy !
2,cheap chinese junk,I must say this is a cheap chinese peace of junk.Wish I would have paid a little more for a solid ice scoop.
1,small,"This item appeared to be well made, but would not hold more than two ice cubes at a time unless you had the third cube balanced perfectly. We wound up with a larger size."
4,President of BHP Enterprise,While i haven't had use of the product for a long time....i love the quality and realize that I have made the right choice over other similiar products.
1,It's for kids,"I bought it with a bunch of other books about cryptography (serious ones), but it is written for kids. One of the codes is a sentence with the words written backwards. Another is letters split up into blocks, but you can still just read the words straight across. It's really not helpful."
1,Not the same from tv,This one was a knock off version you have to hold the button down the hole time during use and I believe the offical one had a swich to click on or off also I seemed to get a headache after shaking it or it could have been the Msg in a Dairy Qeen foot long hot dog I ate at the same time.
5,Best Oil for your BUCK!,I switched from conventional oil to RP synthetic sometime ago and have never looked back. I have doubled the interval time for oil changes and increased motor life and gas mileage at the same time. Good for the environment and good for the check book. That is all i have to say about that!
3,"Ho Hum,,,,,,Nothing Special Oil","Problem I have with RP is that it has an incredible amount of Sulphur which to me, translates to sulfuric acid in the oil ( I could be wrong but the max allowed in SN rating I believe is 5000 for S ). I find Valvoline to be relatively cheap and the syn oil is very good. Since I change it at 3000 miles, I want a cheaper but good syn oil. The more often you change the oil, the longer the engine lasts I am told. I think RP is overpriced on hype and the S content is a turn off."
2,Over priced and inferior.,"I used Royal Purple Synthetic in my last Truck for a few years until they started asking arms, legs and first born children for the oil. I did my homework and started reading reports of independent lab's testing. I found out that Royal Purple ranks below Mobil 1 and Amsoil. I switched to the best oil made, Amsoil, and never looked back."
1,Garbarge,"It wouldn't read one of my SD cards for no apparent reason. Also, the quality of workmanship is poor. It arrived with factory scratches on both the frame and the screen. Cheap, cheap, cheap! However, these problems are secondary. The real clencher is the picture quality. If I was to rate the picture quality 1 - 5 stars, I'd give it 0 stars. It's very low-res, liney, grainy, and digitized; the colors are not true; and it flickers. Looks like something you'd expect from a cheap children's toy, NOT a photo frame touted as ""the ideal way to showcase all your digital photos."" Your photos would look better printed on notebook paper by an old dot matrix printer. And you'd save money that way. The only reason I gave it one star is that it does function. You put in a card and (if you're lucky) it will display your photos, do a slide show, etc. But if you're looking for a quality product, I suggest looking to someone other than Digital Spectrum."
3,Came scratched,"Our frame came with a scratch on the frame and several scratches on the screen. The fabric it was packed in was very rough and the culprit of the screen scratches. I can't attest to the function of the frame because we returned it. The packing issues were from the manufacturer.On a positive note, the return process was extremely smooth with amazon!"
5,"""A Must"" for those people out there who want to build a strong team","You don't know what you're missing until you read this book. It contains so many valuable information that are important for team's growth and development. The book is also easy to read and understand, you just have to probably use Microsoft Word to help jot down notes. Highly recommended for leaders, supervisors, and CEOs."
5,A great book!,A good book to read. Easy to follow and uses a common sense approach. Some good concepts. Overall a good one.
1,Save your money,"Believe me, this one is not for you! SAVE YOUR MONEY! RATHER BUY ""The Beginner's Guide To C++"" by Oleg Yaroshenko. Oleg's book covers OOP very well in the last chapters and gives you a rock solid understanding of the C++ language. This book is however not for someone switching to Borland C++ or Visual C++, it only covers the C++ language elements."
1,Very poor,"I've heard about this band around town (Nashville). A few people like them others think they are highly overrated. I agree with the latter. This cd is for people looking for silly, fluffy over produced country music. Every song, besides some of the covers, seems Derivative and hollow. I would not recommend this cd or any of this bands cd's to any true music enthusiast."
3,Good One,"A hero and main characters that are three dimensional and realistic, make this an enjoyable read. Good atmosphere and nasty villians keep it moving. Bring on the next one."
2,Ordered black... Got green,Urghh.. Can I be bothered to return it and wait again for the right one?? Otherwise it seems nice. The color just isn't my taste..
4,Cute set,"This teapot was absolutely great! It brewed tea precisely as I wanted and easily made two cups worth. Just a warning though, be careful and watch the teapot so as too avoid water boiling out. Also handle with care once you've boiled the water, since the teapot gets extremely hot."
5,Nice compact sander.,"It is a little ""buzzy"" in your hand, but very good value. Nice sander, dust port, nice case.For the money, hard to beat."
4,GMC ADS75 1.1 Amp Detail Sander with Dust Port,"great product, it came w a case u cant beat the price for 11 bucks"
3,Lockgroove - 'Rewired' (Krave),"This neo-psychedelic band from Boston so far has put out two CD's. This being an EP is about as good as their 'Sleeping On The Elephant Log' effort {see my review}. Tunes here I got the most out of were the somewhat stunning ""Sundown"", the sedate ""Dragonfly"" and ""Traced In Fire"". Take a look at that used price. Considering that alone, 'Rewired' is definitely worth check out. Heard they were currently putting a third CD together."
3,Basically it's a good tool-------but!,"If this was self leveling and the adjustment knobs less prone to comming off, it would be excellent. It takes time to level it to the point where you have great accuracy. When you hang it, as in when you use it to set a drop ceiling it is even more difficult to keep level in both axies.The knob coming off is a minor deal except for the fact that it takes a very small alan wrench (not included) to fix it. Oh, one more thing, the glasses came with a broken eyepiece."
3,I finally found a belt for a toddler!,I have been looking for a toddler belt for a long time. I found these and they are ok. They hold my sons pants up for the most part. I would have given it more stars if they could be tightened.Thanks for selling these!!
2,Bought two and both started going flat after couple of months of use,"I bought two of these balls. They look very nice. It is a low bounce ball. Perfect for using it in the gym of the church where we play. However, after just a couple of weeks one of them started to loose air. I could pump it before playing and will last the game. After a couple more weeks it would not stay inflated for more than 20 minutes. We started using the other ball but the same thing happened to that one too. Do not recommend this ball. Low quality"
4,Great book,"This is a great book. I tried to learn with lots of books before this, but this book makes hard concepts easy and fun to understand. I highly reccomend it."
3,Interesting Look at Washington,"Relatively well made film, the computer generated graphics that created larger number of soldiers on the battlefield and some of the other scenes was some of the best I have seen. Washington's portayer did a very good job even though he spoke VERY little during the entire film. My only issue with this was the filming in Lithuania and nothing against Lithuanians but while watching the story something just did not appear ""right"".Very informative and energetic, can help attract even greater attention to one of the great people in American History."
2,Just Like That,"The premise of this book seemed interesting - but I found that I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.I did come to semi-appreciate our MC, Hanna, who is experiencing an incredible amount of change in her life. Qualey managed to convey most of the reactions and emotions that one would feel in Hanna's place quite accurately. I felt quite compassionate for her during some of the more crazy scenarios that occurred; there were also times however when I wanted to give her a shove and basically offer my own unsolicited advice.What I felt turned me off of the book, however, was that, apart from occasionally feeling for Hanna, I just didn't really care about much of the story or the characters. I'm not heartless, but I felt like the story was just a bunch of dramatic events pieced together haphazardly. Some of the characters also, were a bit two dimensional.All in all, this is a pretty average read for me."
4,Wonderful Movie,"I find myself watching this movie over and over. The production values are a bit on the low side. Parts of the story are predictable. It is, despite this, a lovely story of finding one's place in the world."
3,"Well meaning, but ...","You can admire the source material and respect a tough battle won without actually appreciating the end result (ie, the film). There is just too little material and stretched to the limit. The sensation of been there, seen that is just too strong."
4,Experienced Alcan Driver,"The Milepost is an excellent resource but for many purposes the information is outdated soon after print. Information which would be very helpful on the Alcan Hwy just isnt there. Important and current info regarding fueling, sleeping/camping along the Hwy is neglected. It is a good tool for planning a trip to give a one an idea of what to expect taking into account important Alcan trip info is often times inadequate or just plain not there."
4,Milepost 2006 review,"This is exactly what I was looking for, there is a great deal of information to diseminate, but it seems to be very detailed and am sure will prove valuable during our stay there."
3,"Not great, but one of the few books about the '71 Pirates","Not quite as in-depth as most people would like considering the lack of books written about the 1971 Pirates, but for about $10 it wasn't a horrible buy either.The author describes the season, highlights some of the players and talks about a reunion the team had in the early ninties. There was not a lot of interview and commentary by the players, mostly the author's reflections and the general story itself.Lots of photos, although most are from far away and very few closeups. Not great quality, although shots of the ceremony honoring Roberto Clemente were interesting to see.This book is probably for Pirate fans only, but again not a horrible buy for the price, provided you are not expecting a 200-300 page expose."
4,Not a Complete Set!,"This CD collection does not contain the ""complete sacred music of Antonio Vivaldi."" Among those missing include the following works: Mass in C major, RV 586; Credo in G, RV 592; Credidi Propter Quod in C, RV 605; Lauda Jerusalem in E, RV 609; Magnificant in G, RV 611; and Intro in G, RV 636. The latter pieces are available in Phillips' Vivaldi Sacred Choral Music, Volumes 1 -5 featuring the John Alldis Choir and English Chamber Orchestra conducted by Vittorio Negri. Putting that disappointment aside, the collection is a great choice."
5,Great for BIG dogs!,"We have a Saint Bernard and a trip to the groomer costs in excess of $125. At our last visit we learned the groomer was using this product to trim our big girl so we purchased our own and started trimming her ourselves. A word of caution: If you're using this shear to trim a large dog you have to be VERY careful! This isn't like using dog grooming shears. The shears have razor sharp, pointy blades and it's a good idea to talk to someone who has sheared sheep or the like to get some tips or even wacth them handle the product. You can seiously hurt your pet if you don't know what you're doing.The product is excellent."
1,Sony Clie software disc,The SONY Clie worked great for a couple of days and then it crashed my computer (i.e. destroyed my hard drive.) When I got a new computer thestore that I bought it from loaded additional soft ware for me but when they tried to load the SONY Clie they said the the disc was contaminated and would ruin my computer.
3,"Good, but...","... not $54 + $12 shipping good.I haven't tasted these in 25 years. My French boss used to bring back a box or two whenever she came back from Europe, and back then I thought they were the best thing I'd ever put in my mouth. Imagine how pleased I was when I discovered they were available through Amazon!Well, a lot has changed since then. The filling texture seems margarine-y to me (somewhat like whipped Crisco) rather than the creamy, melt-in-your-mouth goodness I remember. Also, the flavor seems less pronounced, and the hazelnuts are definitely not as fresh and crunchy as they once were.Maybe it's just me, or perhaps this is a shipping version of the recipe, better suited to handle temperature swings and rough handling. Whatever the reason, I wouldn't pay $66 for 1.5 lb box again; $25-30 seems about right."
4,Great Tie Dye Kit...but definitely won't dye as many shirts as stated!,"I bought this kit because of its great reviews. And indeed it was a great kit. The DVD gave simple and clear instructions and I followed it exactly and the results were wonderful. I used this kit as an activity at my daughter's birthday party and the kids loved it. The only problem is that it states that the kit will dye 10-15 shirts and I used TWO kits to dye 15 youth size t-shirts. It was very apparent to me when I watched the DVD that the lady was using alot of dye for one t-shirt and thankfully I purchased another kit just to be on the safe side, and I did use all the dye and ash soda of BOTH kits.I would totally recommend this kit for the project but would suggest that you half the amount of t-shirts it states to dye."
5,Fun & Easy!,"I had never really tie-dyed anything before and thought it would be time consuming, difficult and messy. But this kit made it seem like a peice of cake! I had my doubts even after I mixed all the colors & tied up the garments and even after I dyed them and set them overnight to set... but when I untied the final product the next morning it was surprised to see just how awesome everything turned out! I used this with my kids & a couple of their friends they had over for a sleepover & it was the perfect activity! I washed all the shirts we made in the morning & they wore them home that afternoon. I get so many compliments on my creations! Great product! It's been a few months now and nothing has faded!"
3,Too strong smelling,"This was recommended early in pregnancy to me and I know it's highly loved by all, but, I just could never get over the smell. Granted, my sense of smell has been super heightened during pregnancy and it made this almost always unbearable to use - it was just too intense in smell.I've since switched to organic coconut oil. Belly skin is just as soft for a fraction of the price and the smell is much more tolerable to me."
5,Hamilton Beach 70595 Big Mouth 14-Cup Food Processor with Bonus Blade,"I love this Hamilton Beach 70595 Big Mouth 14-Cup Food Processor with Bonus Blade, I got it just in time to make salsa this year and it was wonderful. Some of the reviews I read talked about it leaking. As long as it is not filled to the brim with liquid it's great, no leak."
2,overthought. too gimmicky,"I bought this as I am an avid gardener, and trying to eat healthy. I was attracted to the ""big mouth"", as I find it frustrating to have to precut veggies to fit the food processor. However, the safety mechanism is poorly made, and almost immediately one of the several top plastic mouths broke off. Now if I use the hard plastic pusher, there is no ""stop"" for it...and twice now it has hit the blade. So I have had to empty the bowl of food with plastic slivers, and start over. I no longer use the pusher, and can't even figure out anymore where the extra plastic piece went.Luckily my cleaning lady misplaced the chopping blade. I have torn the kitchen apart and cannot find it. I can't seem to find a source for a replacement. So I have license to buy a new food processor. I think I will go a little smaller, and make more batches."
3,broken lid rim,About a year ago I bought a Hamilton Beech food processor. For many years I used HB food processor and they all seemed satisfactory. But this last one was not. After a few month of use the rim lid locks cracked and broke one by one until I could no longer use the lid. I wrote HB and received replacement lid. After using the machine twice the same thing happened to the new lid.I am not sure if it is the design that is faulty or the material used in the lid but I do know that is not satisfactory.
1,You get what you pay for...,"..and in this case, not even that. I arranged to return mine the day I got it. Chops and slices food unevenly leaving lots of ""chunks"" among the slices. Holding the handle and trying to twist the bowl to the right to remove it is very difficult. There is nothing to hold onto to push the other way. Believe me, if you have any kind of arthritis in your hands, this is not the product for you. The materials it is made out of, including the blades, are cheap, inferior. Yes, it is also big and bulky, but I could have adjusted to that had it been a good product. The ""Big Mouth"" feeding tube is the only plus, but that wasn't enough to warrant keeping it. I have a used food processor I got at a yard sale 14 years ago that does a better job. I only ordered a new one because I needed a bigger bowl."
1,Not working,it just stopped working. I dont know why and Im disappointed that it dosent work. When I get around to it Ill return it.
3,The cookbook is nice,"The cookbook is great. My issue is with either the shipper or the seller because the book was damaged when it arrived. The front, bottom, right-hand corner was smashed and just disfigured. I'm not sure if it was sent out that way or if it happened during shipping, either way the book was shipped in a sparsely padded envelope so it didn't have much of a chance anyway. The cookbook was cheap and it's not like I'm going to put it on display so I'm keeping it, but I am disappointed."
2,Gel Toe Protector,"The gel toe protector I received looked just like the picture. However, it did not fit on my large toe. It's even too tight for my fingers. I will not be using this product. It is just too uncomfortable."
1,Lasted only 3 weeks!!,"I have used my GEL Toe Protector for only 3 weeks (a few times a week playing tennis or jogging) and it is already ruined. There is a big hole in the top of the Toe Protector rendering it useless. The product worked fine for the first 2 weeks, but then the hole started to develop and it is now ruined! $6.09 for 3 weeks of product life is terrible!"
4,No More Lost Cup Holder Space!,"This is a one in a hundred find for those tired of losing cup holder space to make room for an ash tray. Tray is 3-5/8""W X 1-5/8""D X 2""H. It comes with an adhesive backing to stick it on a vertical surface, easily slips off the removable back for emptying and it's small enough to fit in a cranny of most any console (mine fit between the emergency brake handle and console top without getting in the way of the handle). If you don't have a vertical spot to stick it to, put some velcro on the bottom and discard the removable back for horizontal mounting instead. You may need a can of spray paint though as the lid is chrome and the body finish is gloss black - not the best color match for the console I have, but an easy enough fix to match most any interior. A four-star rating is the average of five for a being the only tray I could find that let me keep my cup holder and three for the gloss finish and chrome lid that doesn't match modern interiors very well."
5,Cute Frogs in Love,"These two adorable frogs are perfect just about anywhere. I had orginally got them for my garden, but when they came they were so cute. I decided to keep them in the house away from the elements of the outdoors. They now have a permant place on my second step leading to the upstairs. Perfect for anywhere you please. Cute!."
1,Idiot's Delight,"Flaky, disingenuous author writes book for flaky individuals whose science education never got past Algebra I in the 9th grade. Do you people really unquestioningly consume all the garbage profiteers want to sell you? Go back to school. It takes work, but you may learn how the world actually works!"
1,No technical information (eg. reliability and validity).,"The book was a requirement for a college class. I loved and still love the book, but I find it difficult to recommend it. I'm extremely disappointed that I could not find any information of any kind of experiment or research done that supports the author's claims that the test used is valid and reliable. The information provided is extremely vague. I would like that information if any is available."
2,Not for people with too much education or life experience,"The tests in this book would probably work best for someone at the early college level. I say this because as an adult with a degree behind me, and years of work/life experience, I took all the tests . . . and found that I scored extremely high in every area. How does this help me? It doesn't. I believe the high scores are a result of life experience - I knew the answers - not because I am gifted in every area, but simply because I have lived long enough to learn the answers. So, in order for this test to measure a person's aptitude, they need to NOT have too much life experience. The only area in which a person may get acurate results even as an older adult is in Logic. Those questions did seem to test the way you think - can you think abstractly? That is an area that may be more difficult to ""learn"" - most of us are either abstract or concrete thinkers by nature."
2,teNeues edition - horrible printing,"I've seen and admired the original edition of this book, which was very well-done and showcases an interesting artist. Unfortunately the new teNeues reissue does not live up to the original. It is frankly one of the worst-printed photography books I've ever seen. I've seen better print quality from color laser printers. Not worth the cost, unless you *really* need to have a book of Bitesnich's work."
4,Very Artistic,"I loved the book. It is well made with thick pages. I also love Bitesnich's work, he does an supreme job forming the human body into a sculpture like forms. I do not like erotic distasteful art that shows nudity for the sake of lust and perverseness. There are very few photos that I dislike in the book, yet the ones that are good are done extremely well...I would suggest this book to anyone wanting to see the human body in such an artistic light!"
4,i like it,"i needed it for class, it was a good price and it definitely met my expectations. worth my money :)"
3,where's little katya??,"I saw only excerpts of this ballet and it really made me sad for one precise reason, I saw the wonderful, inimitable excerpts from Vasiliev and Maximova Spartacus in black and white in The Glory of Bolshoi.In my opinion Bessmertnova represents no glory for the Bolshoi, she's just a ballerina as many othersI wonder why she's in so much tapes and Katya Maximova, far more expressive , far more good is in so little tapes !!Does anyone Knows the answer?"
1,Los Diablos,"No conocian al verdadero y original grupo Los Diablos de Espa√±a, lamentablemente copiaron el nombre. Mucho se pierde por no conocer la discografia de otras partes del mundo, y para que no cometas errores."
1,Politically Contradictory 1960's Thriller with Bad Characterization,"Set in the United Welfare States of America, the characters hate communism and Soviet Russia with a passion. They are living in a socialist republic with 75% of people on the dole, yet don't understand how this is socialism. This only makes sense when you realize the author doesn't get philosophical political theory, which makes this entire book about it into a dumb farce.The actual plot involves the Reverend Ezekiel Tubber, who speaks the Word. When he gets mad, his Words come true. Little Ed, radio host of the paranormal freak midnight show has a talent for inciting Tubber's anger. First Tubber curses women's make-up, creating the homespun look. Then he curses radio, television, and film while on Ed's radio program. Fast forward 70 pages. The USWA can't handle the lack of distraction for the masses, and riots ensue.This 174 pages book concludes in the most obvious way possible.Don't read or buy this work of dated and bad fiction."
4,Decent tape,"I was hoping the color was off in the picture but it's not. I would call this a medium brown tape, not dark. That aside, it's as advertised: PVC, brown, and it tapes vinyl pretty well. A little thin for the application I had in mind, so I put on two layers. So far, so good."
1,Fabio as Darcy,"I found this book to be silly and boring. It is not only totally untrue to Jane Austen's sketch of the character, but it reads like a modern-day drugstore romance novel of the variety that often features Fabio in the cover illustration. It struck me as an adolescent girl's dream version of a man's sexual fantasies. Additionally, the author takes astounding liberties with the personalities of Darcy's parents, for which there is no justification in the original work. Rather than a tribute to the writing of Jane Austen, I found it to be an insult to her readers. There are so many excellent ""sequels"" to Jane Austin's works. This volume is certainly not among them."
3,questionable,"The first time I read this book I liked it. I attribute that to not having read any other sequels of the marvelous Pride and Predjudice. This book chronicles Darcy's life from when he was a boy through a few years into his marriage with Elizabeth. Through the whole book, Darcy's voice does not change. He sounds the same from the time he was 10 on. He's just like a big child. It does not remind me of the real Darcy in the slightest. Fasman incorporates some instances that happened in A&E's P&P and in The Bar Sinister, Pride and Predjudice continues (a much better continuation). There are a few discrepencies in the book that deviate a little too much for comfort. If you want to read it, I don't think it'll damage you completely, but there are much better sequels out there (i.e. THe Bar Sinister by Linda Berdoll, Letters from Pemberley)."
3,Amusing Read,I agree that this author is way off on the timeline of events. It's an amusing and quick read but not for Jane Austen Purists. The characters do things that our beloved Darcy and Lizzy would not.It was entertaining but honestly not what I consider a companion to Pride and Prejudice. It is more of an aside. An inaccurate aside.
3,OK product,"This a not a miracle product for me. I am using an acne skincare line, too, & I don't know if the Bye Bye Blemish helps or not. If it does help diminish a blemish, it's definately not overnight."
3,Comes Off Too Easy,"I put this on before I go to bead and when I wake up it's gone. When it dries, it dries as a powder which is why it doesn't stay on. It'd be unrealistic to expect it to stay on but maybe some modifications should be made so the lotion stays on for a bit longer. I don't see how the lotion could help shrink pimples when it only stays on for less than two hours.I find that this works best with pimples that already have a white tip. Put it on when you get home from work so it can work on your blemishes as you're up and about."
2,Daniel Geen slippers a little wide this time,slippers were a little wider than usual a little to wide for me this time. They always fit in the pass I have been ordering this lipper for years and they always fit me well.
3,Dormie slippers,"I love the slippers, have been wearing them for ages, but only gave them 3 stars, as the last few pairs haven't worn well. The main problem - the covering wears off and the foam underneath gets worn away in spots. I realize this would happen, it just seems it happens way too quickly."
3,Not true to the size in pewter color,"Good product but 8.5 is really 9 or 9.5 in pewter color, go figure...Wanted to exchange to 8 but they're more expensive in this size."
2,Stiff as a board,I thought these would make good sandals for running short trips out of the house. They look nice but there is zero flexibility to the sole so it's a lot like having a board strapped to your foot. I returned these and would not recommend them.
3,summer slippers,"I wanted summer slippers and they are ok for the price. Bare-footed the plastic sticks to the foot but I knew before I bought them. It is the nature of plasic and heat. The rim on top is a bit tight I probably should have taken a wide but I was afraid they would fall off my feet. Interestingly, Daniel Green did not offer half size as Amazon does."
5,Return time flexibility need it!!!!!!,"My mom and my aunts from Mexico love the dormie sleppers,two of the slipper were the wrong size and took more than 30 days for me to send it to Mexico ans bring them back and couln't return them. I order size 6.5 and need it size 6, so I have to buy them again and still have two pair of size 6.5 in boxes, I wouldo like yuu to consider this situation and help me to get my money back. I am a good custumer. Thank you."
1,NO RESPECT FOR TURKISH ART,"It is very dissapointing to see an example of an znik tile (Turkish) on the cover of a book under the name ""Islamic Tiles"". Anyone with the least respect to art, to the very origin of that art and to the country (TURKEY) where that art has flourished should be more selective in choosing a design such symbolic of our country. Either the title or the picture on the book should be changed. Our precious inheritance deserves to be named or used correctly. If knowledge isn't sufficient, please refer to books by dear Nurhan Atasoy or Azade Akar. ART certainly deserves respect and so does nations."
5,One Of Kurosawa's Best Films,"I am a huge fan of Akira Kurosawa. I have watched as many of his movies as I could find. Seven Samurai was the first film I saw by him and I still think it is his best. It's hard to say, but Throne of Blood might be my second favorite. Their are a few other movies that challenge it, such as Yojimbo, but I think that it might be Throne of Blood. First of all, Throne of Blood is mostly based on Shakespeare's Macbeth. It turns out to be one of the best adaptations of Shakespeare's work to film. Kurosawa, however, did not just copy the story word for word. He hads some really brilliant concepts to the story and changes some of the scenes to fir the story seamlessly. Toshiro Mifune gives one of his best performances. Overall, Throne Of Blood is a very impressive movie that is both artistic and entertaining."
3,macbeth the tragic hero?,"Watching movie during class, has been always my favorite. Since i had read Macbeth quite numerous time and watched several different style of video of it during the class last year long, it came easy for me to understand the Japanese Macbeth also.Written by Shakespear, and filmed by Japanese, was really interesting.First of all I really liked the Title of it;Throne of blood, it had well decribed the image of the tagic hero. Washizu had well expressed the feelings of the stong ambitious charater.Language in the film was in Japanese, old type of Japanese, hard to understand, but still it had well translated. It must be hard to translate shakespears' difficult language into Japanese, but it had well done, and also they transcend the cultural gap.oh, my favorite scene was when Washizu got the arrow stuck on his neck.^^"
5,"Talent, Looks...Lets get this girl some exposure!",Alecia has twice the talent and all the looks that Brittany ever thought of having! In her video her moves are as smooth as her singing style! If this is the direction young country is going...I'm going along for the ride! I just don't understand why she hasn't been getting more exposure. The exec's at her label are really lacking in exposing this hot new artist!
1,worst earphones ever,"These are the cheapest worst headphones I've ever had. They cut out intermittantly--messing with my I-pod. The sound quality is terrible. They are so cheap they aren't worth sending back, but don't waste a cent on these."
3,Just headphones,"if you just want a pair of cloned earbuds with nopadding on the buds, and just hear music, then this is for you.the sound is not so great. And you get what you pay for."
2,Cheap,Fell apart quickly. The wire was exposed and the screening on the actual speaker disappeared causing the inner workings of the speaker to become very dirty
1,IPOD HEADPHONE,WHEN I SAW THIS HEADPHONE ON PICTURES .I WENT AND BOUGHT THEM . I SHOULD HAVE LISTEN TO THE REVIEW. THEY OWN WORK FOR A DAY OR TWO. THEY ARE BAD . DON'T BUY IT.
1,Get what you paid for.,"When they came in the mail I knew I wasn't going to get a apple headphones even tho in the picture they have the gray (L) and (R) sybols on each headphone just like the ones on the Apple headphones but that's what i'm writting this review about I just want people to know that these headphones are good for kids who have 3 bucks laying around but not for teens or adults who are looking to use them 24/7 and to have them blasting in your ear. Overall they feel weird and the pack it came in was very cheap and the ear buds were not comfortable at all, and having to put them back in my ear every time i get up or turn my head was kind of annoying after a few time(s)."
2,audifonos,en realidad no me gusto la compra de este articulo pense que era mucho mejor el sonido a la hora de escuchar musica le doy un 2
1,worst product ever,"Okay, these things suck! Really bad sound quality! The left bud stopped working by the second day and by the third day they both stopped working!!! not buying cheap headphones anymore from this seller! Read the Reviews before you buy! I know i didn't so dont make the same mistake!Lowest was 1 star; wish i could give it less!"
1,You get what you pay for...,"Please don't buy these headphones if you are expecting to get a lot of bang for your buck. They cost very little, and therefore have very little quality. I used them for about 2 weeks and stopped. They hurt, the sound is horrible, and they fall apart quickly. If you need some quick headphones to use for a temporary amount of time, then get these. But if you need a good quality pair then trust me, it's worth it to spend the few extra bucks."
5,Perfect,"Shipped immediately to me, these headphones are worth way more than I paid. Very good quality. Excellent customer service as well. Excellent Value and Product"
1,not real ipod headphones,"these are not real ipod headphones, they only look like it and the product page tries to trick you into thinking you are buying real ipod headphones. the sound quality is horrible compared to real ipod headphones and you will realize this immediately once you use them. don't bother buying them because you will replace them immediately."
4,Very Cute,"What can i say? It's a great toy but, it dosen't do much, but it's so cute how they have their own personalites! Mine never wants to go to sleep!!!! She'll scream and cry just like a real baby very cute and durable!! My cat got ahold of her and she still works great!!!!"
4,it good but its not for everyone,"this has some beautiful art in it. it also has some ugly art.... if thats what you can call it. but it does show you each artist's technic if not how they did each peice. so if you like anima and photoshop look into it. oh, thats what you are doing? well i gave it 4 stars didnt i. maybe three.... but i have had a good day."
4,Lots of Low fat recipes,"For the most part I like the recipes in this book. The only problems - not a single picture. I think all cookbooks should have lots of pictures. Also for many of the low fat recipes, she recommends that you keep them only for 4 hours. I don't know about you, but I can't eat a whole batch of ice cream in a sitting. I kept the ice cream longer and the low fat varieties tend to get hard. The sorbet and granita recipes are great."
1,Terrible Book,"I am currently taking this course and must agree with many of the individuals before me. Even the example problems often have incorrect calculations, for instance with probabilities and percentages greater than 1! Not 1.009, but say 1.14, 1.32 etc. It is very frustrating. A terrible class text."
2,Not a very Thorough book about Franklin,I enthusiastically purchased this book as a brief (400+) page biography about Ben Franklin about three months ago. I did not like the book. It is hard to read and does not really focus on Franklin but more on the events surrounding his life.The book does not explain the events going on around him and what they mean. It just seems like a bunch of events that BF had happened to be around. I was disappointed because the book was poorly written and had numerous grammatical errors. I now know pretty much the same about BF as when I started reading it.I would not recommend this book.
5,"Excellent Product, worth every penny","I have numerous injuries related to one too many parachuting accidents. I began using this product on the recommendation of my orthopedic surgeon. I walk between six to ten miles, six days a week (age 55), I can tell when I ""...forget..."" to take this product, my knees remind me. It is terrific. There are other products like this one, this one is easy to swallow, not too big, not too small. Easy on your stomach and you don't burp up any taste."
5,natures bounty,Natures Bounty is an excellent product and YAHOO is a great way to order!!! Thank you so much for the excellent product and fast service!!! Ted
3,A bit too general and did not realize it was mini edition.,"After purchasing this book from Amazon, I was quite disappointed when I received it in the mail. I did not even notice the very fine print on the cover of the book that says Miniature Edition in the green bubble or notice the dimensions in its description. If you are truly interested in learning about bartending, I would not recommend this book because of its lack of detail and depth. A majority of the book is simply different drink ingredients, but even those are very limited because of the small size of the book. I really wish I could go back and spend the extra 4 dollars on a full sized book that would be MUCH more useful for me. Buy the paperback edition of Bartending for Dummies, and not the hardcover!"
2,Just a recipe book.,"Like other reviewers said, this book is only good as a cocktail recipe list. At best, it could provide very basic knowledge to someone who has never heard of alcohol before, and the descriptions/histories of different kinds of spirits are moderately interesting (if incomplete). Also, the writer's tone is quite obnoxious, written with a constant attitude of ""this isn't important, but my editors told me to include it."" Seriously.Even more problematic, the recipe list isn't even that good, because it lists everything in alphabetical order (about 200 pages worth of recipes listed at 3-5 per page); there is no way to tell which cocktail is more or less likely to be ordered."
3,"Well, the title doesn't lie.","If you're a home bartender, this is the book for you! It has has everything for people who want to impress friends or just enjoy the craft of mixology. Has a large recipe section.I am a bartender and it was recommended to me from a friend and I am dissapointed. Having been a bartender for a while, I already knew most of the information included in this book and actually disagreed with a thing or two. But, like all things in life, take it for what it is. If you are a home bartender or a commercial one starting out this is for you! Carefully explains everything from different types of glassware to different types f liquor and mixes. LEARN WHAT SOUR MIX REALLY IS! It will help you greatly. For experienced bartenders, I would recommend instead the Joy of Mixology (attacks the subject from a history-evolution standpoint) and the Bartender's Black book (great recipe book) instead."
1,very weak for a newbie...,"The book fails to discuss typical bar lingo that the author himself uses! For example ""neat"" , he doesnt even tell the want to be bartender what an ""up"" drink means! The book is 90% recepies , go to Walgreens and buy the ""Black Book"" it has awesome recepies. I was really expecting a book that dealt with lingo, do and dont's, tip and tricks but all the book really consists of is recpies."
3,"Decent, but dissapointed.",There are a number of cocktail recipes in this book.But the introductory sections on bartending basics andequipment leave me dissapointed.
4,Keeps it clean!,"Keeps my wifes lil MacBook clean and looking like new. Wish we had installed this on my sons MacBook. Getting the body oils and dirt out of the finish on the top of the MB is impossible. The only negative I have to add is that the corners come loose. No big deal, just a little annoying."
1,This game's name is it's only clever element,"Proved to be a disappointing choice for our new annual Thanksgiving game. The instructions were laborious and slow. The questions were based on stereotypical assertions...men are insensitive brutes, women are flighty, fussy dullards. There was nothing new in this game. There were no clever questions or scenarios offered in the cards. After a half hour of struggling for a laugh...we switched back to our two satisfying 'good-time standbys'...Taboo and Compatibility."
2,Game,Good Game I guess but not too entertaining depending on who you play it with. Will give it more trys in different groups of people.
5,Ready to run right out of box!,"Simple, easy to you and it is fantastic to be able to separately control two trains speed and direction at the same time! Bought for my 4 year old grandson but truth be told, I have had more fun stetting it up because it was ready to go after opening the box!"
4,gossip girl,"Upon completing the first two novels in the ""Gossip Girl"" series I was throughly excited that I had discoverd a book that intrested me. However, after hurridly reading the third book in the series i was a bit disappointed. It appeard that the author(Cecily Von Ziegesar) was tryin to out do herself. The book wasn't very well written and the plot wasn't as exciting as the first two novels. However I did enjoy reading it. It was as entertaining as gossip itself."
3,Good book,"I Agree w/ stellar, the third was kinda slow. I also caught the same mistakes stellar did too, in the first 2 the author said one thing but in the third it was different. Other than that I liked the books a lot, I read the first 2 books in about 10 hours but the third took a little longer and some of the chapters with Dan and Vanessa I skipped over b/c they were kinda boring. I can't believe the next one won't be coming out until Sept.!!! hopefully there will be some new characters added and the author will stick with the things she wrote in the first 2 instead of changing it and getting us confused. Can anyone recommend any other books like this b/c I need some to get me through the days at the beach in the summer."
3,Third helping of gossip,Third book in the gossip girl series. Love it. Love Blair. Love Nate. Hate Serena. Blair and Serena are on vacation with Aaron and Blair's family. Really good fun read although not the best in the series. Buy the whole set these books are worth it.
3,"""Everything"" and Anything","Deck the halls with gossip and heartache. Gossip Girl is back, chatting up a storm over the holidays as the teenagers travel with their friends and family to the richest hot spots. Some endure the snow at home in Manhattan; others hit the tropical islands. No matter where they are, the drama continues.Blair and Serena attempt to reconcile their friendship. Blair's stepbrother Aaron attempts to catch the eye of Serena, as does a celebrity. Nate attempts to woo a freshman. Vanessa and Dan attempt to be a couple. Every reader attempts to guess the identity of Gossip Girl, but that's still under wraps.There's love, hate, beaches, gifts, parties and a break from school. Like the previous books in the series, ALL I WANT IS EVERYTHING is a page turning soap opera. 'Tis the season."
5,Amazing,"This was one of the greatest books i have ever read! Being a girl (teenage) this is the best! Being a fan of ""Sex and the City"" made this even better!!! it really is Sex and the City for the younger set! I read all af them in less than 3 weeks, i couldnt put them down. ( i mean who in there right mind could!) Just so everyone knows NATE IS THE GREATEST!"
2,Chicken Soup For The Sister's Soul 2,"I received this book just in time. I'm giving it as a gift to one of my sisters,when I go on vacation. The shipping was speedy."
2,Unsure about this one!,"Next time, I think I'll buy something that feels more like skin, this was rather large for me. It hurt a little."
1,NOT A JELLY VIBE,"First of all, I got this for a girl im seeing who has been bugging me to get her a vibrator....yes, I could have went to the adult store and shopped around a little bit, but hey...I'm a guy...i'm lazy.That said, I thought ""what a bargain!"" A jelly vibe for this cheap? Not even close....you could use this thing to stab somebody in the heart.....it is super hard acrylic plastic...which I guess if thats what you are looking for or your only experience with vibrators was in the 50s wouldnt be such a bad thing.Typical vibrator...screw bottom to increase velocity....thats it...Do not buy this thing if you are looking for a jelly vibe."
3,Entertaining,As always Jackiss' books have a lot happening in them.Onec you sort the people out it is a great read as always.
5,Simenon's favorite and mine too,"I read this book in Spanish, where it was given the title La Mirada Inocente, and became so fond of it that when I thought I had lost it during a move, I was stunned. The novel painstaking reveals the life of a boy sensitive to visual impressions who emerges from his ordinary boyhood to become an artist. I love this book for the way Simenon piles on details as if he were a painter applying color and for giving me Louis.By the way, I only found out this book was Simenon's favorite of his works when I found it today on Amazon."
2,Micro babies,"I have 3 of these dolls for my daughter, and too be honest with you, I think they are not up too standards. They are sooo small! My daughter is 3 1/2 and she liekd the dolls for the first week but she has gone right off them now, so has her 5 year old cousin. The doll's arn't expensive, so I bought them to see what they were like, but I would not buy them again. I'm not sure my little girl will play with them again."
1,very disappointed with this product,"I bought this mail station as a gift for my mother-in-law's 80th birthday in August - it took me hours and hours to get system set up - and still this mailstation has never worked quite as advertised. However, when the mailstation is working my mother-in-law has really enjoyed doing e-mails around the country and to missionaries in other countries. In early November her system bombed, and mailstation sent her a replacement - while we were visiting her for Thanksgiving I again spent hours and hours getting mailstation set up - their customer service reps are pros on giving you the run around, and blaming all problems on other areas such as possible surges or problems with electrical outlets, phone lines etc etc - now again, her system has bombed -we are at our witts end, if someone from mailstation reads this I'd love to hear from them if they can help us -"
4,Cook Magic Talking Microwave,"I ordered the Cook Magic Talking Microwave from Amazon.com and received it in less than one week. The product works well for people with visual disabilities although you will need some sighted assistance setting up the clock. The buttons are easy to understand and will work well for most applications (heating water, warming a dinner plate). I only gave 4 stars because of the need for assistance with the clock. Otherwise, I would highly recommend for blind or low vision user."
4,Blade of the Poisoner,"I loved the book, I wish that he would write a sequel to it.....what happens the Cryltaur Tabbetang, the wizard, do they save him or what? Other than that, It is a great book, although it is a little short......"
5,Our favorite book,"This is my absolute favorite kids book. We bought this for my son when he was about a year old. He loved finishing the sentences and was so proud that he knew them. He could practically recite the book from memory by 18 months we read it so much. Unfortunately, the book wore out. My son is now 5 and I am finally buying another copy of this book for my two younger children. I highly recommend it to everyone."
5,My Son Loves This Book,"I purchased a second copy of this book from Amazon. The first copy I came across by accident at Powell Books in Portland, Oregon. I showed it to my then 2 1/2 year old and for the rest of our stay in Portland, I had to read it to him over and over again. The prose is whimsical and the illustrations are simply marvelous, absolutely beautiful. If your child loves animals (real or stuffed), you have to get this one."
5,"Boisterous, Sweet, and Instantly Engaging","This story of a little girl and her boisterous, friendly, semi-imaginary wild pets was an instant favorite with my 21-month old daughter. The copy is perfect: it rhymes, it goes with the pictures, and there's isn't very much of it, so for once the story proceeds at the right brisk pace for little page turners. And the pictures of the impish girl and the things she does with the animals are very engaging. The rhino drinks tea, the pig has mud fights, and the dragon needs looking after when he has a cold. We both had this one memorized in less than a day. I can tell it will join ""Gorilla"" ""Moon"" and our other favorites on the frequently read list."
4,I Know A Rhino,"An outstanding visual and lyrical story about silly animals and the situations they bring to our imaginations. I purchased this book for my great nephew shortly after taking him on a trip to the zoo... he loved identifying the animals, remembering them at the zoo, and giggling at the possibility of taking tea with a rhino or taking a bath with a giraffe. He wanted to read it over and over... and so did I!"
5,Wonderful bedtime story,I read this book every night to my first son until he loved it a little too much. Bought it again for his brothers to enjoy and they love it as well. Rhyming flows very well.
4,Thorough and readable,"The Road to Now is a thorough account of the history of blacks in Montreal, from the founding of ht eterritory by France right until the beginning of the 1990's. Of course, a history that covers such a long sweep of history, with so many factors to consider (economic, sociological, political etc) some detail will be lost. The Road to Now focusses on the broad sweeps, rather than the individuals of history. It is the history of a community, rather than the people in it. What this gives the reader in scope and perspective it takes away in engagement. You will learn a lot from this book, but some of the more interesting parts of the story of the black community in Montreal had to be sacrificed for academic purity. We may hope that those stories will come in a later book."
3,Game lasts forever!,"We are big UNO fans in our family of 5 (3 kids 7 and under), so we were all excited about this new twist. At first it was a lot of fun having the machine spit cards out and the kids screamed with delight. HOWEVER, the game never ends. It is nearly impossible to win because you always end up with a pile of 3o cards in your hands. After awhile the game gets really tiresome and there are cards everywhere making it a clean up hassle. I would skip this one."
2,Only fun if and when it attacks!,"I was so excited to get uno attack for Christmas last year! It looked like so much fun on tv and I couldn't wait to try it out on my family after Christmas dinner. However, the cards didn't come out like it does on tv. We had to constantly open the lid to where the cards are stored, and wipe the belt that the cards disburse from down with alcohol on a wash cloth. You can't put all of the cards in the game at once, or they will not come out even when you push the hit fire button and hear the belt moving. I think the people at Uno should redo the whole game over and consider how boring this is for kids to have to stop the game to fix the ""ATTACK"" machine!!!!!!!"
3,uno attack review,"I think this game is a lot of fun you do need to take care of the cards because if they get bent the machine does not dispence them as well so take care of them. I have not been able to find any replacement cards out there. I have used an ironed to get them back to being nice and flat that has helped but they do last for a long time i think. Well anyways the game is fun! I like the fact it spits cards out at you, but i wish it made more sounds . Overall i like the game it's a lot of fun, the more people play it the better.Jim"
2,Uno attack falls short.,"People, please think about this... Do you REALLY want a stream of cards shooting at you? It gets really messy, and you have to stop beween each ""attack"" and clean up the mess on the floor. The belt always gets stuck, and sometimes it inaccuately shoots.I HONESTLY do not understand the whole concept of the enjoyment of cards being shot at your face. Ithit my little sister in the eye, and she started crying.The REGULAR game of uno is fun for all. But not this variation.You play with it once, then it breaks.Please, do not buy the ""Uno attack"" because it doesn't work, its messy, its pointless,a nd its a poor shadow of the original.Good Luck and merry christmas!(...)"
2,Not so good for singles,I heard that this game was really fun and great so I was excited to try it but I live alone and it's not so fun to play by yourself. It was funny when the cards shot out of the machine but if there was a reverse card I had to just play again the same as I would have anyway and when I got the exchange hands card I couldn't really do that either. So as you can see it's a better game for people who have lots of friends. I bet then it would be pretty good. I am so lonely.
5,"Uno Attack is soooooooooo fun, especially for familys!","When my family got this for Christmas last year, my brother and I opened it right away. It is so much fun because instead of drawing cards from a deck, you press the button and cards sometimes come out, and sometimes don't. There is a variety of how many cards come out each time. There are also new cards, like the ""put down all your cards of the same color"" card. You put down all your cards that are the same color as the ""put down all your cards"" card, and then you put down the ""put down all your cards"" card on top of those. In conclusion, this is a great family game."
5,So Much Fun!!!,"I gave this to a couple as a Christmas gift. Six of us played that night when it was opened and we even got together again to play. We laughed a lot, and it was a great way to spend time together. I highly recommend this game for groups of friends."
3,"Like game, but battery eater",We purchased this game at christmas time. The game is a lot of fun to play but it gobbles up the C batteries. It would be really nice if the toy maker would redesign this game so it could be played either with bateries or electronically.
3,"Cards get stuck , Not worth the price","Every time we play this game, the cards seem to get stuck.We spend time cleaning the rubber rollers, and re-stacking thecards. My family doesn't feel like it spits out cards often enough. Original UNO lasts longer and is more fun than this game. Not worth the price."
2,UNo Attack,"This adds a twist to UNO. It doesn't add much more fun factor to the game itself in my opinion. If anything it slows down the game considerably. Sometimes the cards get jammed, you also have to take time to turn the gadget to the person taking the turn. All of this can be no big deal for most I guess. For me it was. I would rather stick to the original UNO game."
4,UNO Attack - Kids Love It!!,"We ordered this game for my 5 1/2 year old and 3 1/2 year old to take to the beach (they love to play the original) They love it. Not sure they care who wins anymore as long as someone is getting cards sent their way. A nice change from the original, but its a much longer version, so be prepared."
1,Refill rip off,"We have had this game for a year now and play it at family gatherings. It is fun, but we found that with a group like our's we quickly ran out of cards. To fix this we mixed in a deck of of regular Uno card, but this is not ideal because you have to substitute new meanings for old symbols that are not used in the new version for new ones that are. Confusing! This could be fixed by buying another deck, but in a city of a few million people we can not find a store that has refill decks. Checking the Mattel web site found that they do not sell them online but list a fair price for the MSRP. However, buying online the price seems to be more than double the MSRP when you include shipping and handling. If you think you will need the extra deck and will also need to replace a couple decks in the future, consider that three refills + S&H may cost much more than the original cost of the game."
3,Not bad for the price,The price is ok with this watch but with tax and shipping its just OK. The sad part is the instructions on how to make this watch work. Good luck to those that may buy this product.
1,Disappointing,"I love the snoogle pillow, but I do not love this cover. There are a couple main reasons. First is that the material is not breathable at all. I keep meaning to check the tag to see exactly what the contents are, but I can tell you that it is not 100% cotton, which is not something I thought to worry about before purchasing. This means that all I do all night is sweat when I use this. Not helpful when I'm already overly warm because I'm pregnant. I've washed the cover several times and it doesn't seem to be getting any softer either. The second issue (aside from the difficulty of putting it on, which you get used to) is that it's a very snug fit in the neck area. This causes the seam there to feel very hard behind my head. If this cover was made out of material that is softer (like regular sheets) it would be much much better."
4,great price,bought this for my wife to replace a snoogle cover for our friend's snoogle that we are borrowing. The product itself is as advertised and way cheaper on amazon. Snoogle covers start to peel or have cotton dots over time and that's why we couldn't use our friend's cover.
5,Great Snoogle Pillow Cover...,"This was a wonderful buy and is a great product. We washed/dried the pillow cover before putting it on the pillow. Since it was a darker color, it did bleed a bit while washing.The process of putting it on the pillow was much easier than I anticipated. Based on some reviews I thought it would take a while, but it only took me about 3 minutes...We highly recommend the Leachco Snoogle Pillow Cover..."
2,Extremely difficult to put on cover!,"I am very disappointed with the design of the cover. I literally worked up a sweat trying to put on this cover. There is only one opening of the cover where you have to try and maneuver the pillow from both ends through. It is absolutely a chore! I am not sure I will have time to remove and replace the cover for cleaning when my baby is born. Unfortunately, this is the only cover made for the pillow so I had to purchase it to keep the pillow itself from getting dirty. When the cover is on, it does fit well which is not a surprise."
3,Not as well made as the original,"The game is still fun for everyone, but the sticks are very flexible which make them difficult to get throught the holes on the opposite side. The original game had very firm sticks so it made it easier to get through, plus with them being firm you really could cut the corners and other things to make the game play more interesting.Still wish I had the original. OR could buy replacement sticks which were firm."
3,"Fun, but flimsy","This is a great classic game, but the sticks are like uncooked spaghetti noodles--thin and very easily broken. I wouldn't recommend it for little kids. Maybe tweens & up."
4,Its made of People! Peeeeeeople!,"Baaa has to be the most disturbing ""children's"" book in the world. Starting with the complete disappearance of the humans, to the meat of the book (sorry, pun) with the sheep, to the last paragraph on the last page (the fish bit is beyond brilliant) this book doesn't stop with the foreboding visuals and narrative. I love the woodcut-style illustrations, and the story still gives me the creeps just thinking about it. I have to recommend it highly."
1,Review of Earth Sciences for Christian School - Bob Jones U.,"This text perpetuates the myths associated with the ""young earth"" philosophy (not science). Ignoring the fossil record, carbon dating, isotope anaylsis and mountains of other data from direct observation that clearly show the earth to be billions of years old, it attempts to fit everything into an existing belief system based on religious writings made by humans. This is the opposite of the scientific method. Many young minds will no doubt be poisoned by this book, which is championed by religious fundamentalists."
4,Fun!,"I just purchased this for a birthday present. I took it out of it's little container and have been playing with it ever since, isn't that terrible?It's so cute. The little baby sings, cries, crawls, kicks her little feet, giggles and sucks her bottle. It's a great little doll to take along on car trips or to keep a child occupied ( or perhaps even an adult.)I recommend this doll. It's cute, it's fun and that's what it should be all about."
1,ultra over priced,I bought mine from local hardware store for under $20. It seems some sellers take advantage of the un-informed
1,broken and expensive,product was broken when i recieved it. drain pan is not much use if it has cracks in it plus it was way overpriced but at the time i needed one and could not find one locally. i have since found some locally for $32.00 less. what a waste
3,not in laymens language,"book is not bad but seems to me to be a bit long in the tooth ,seems to go on and on and onBullet points in easy to read laymens terms would be nice ,goes into too much depth for me,gets a bit tiringCould have condensed the info more effectively in my opinion"
3,ORIGINAL SINGER MUCH BETTER...,"OK, the new lead vocalist is good. Angela has a powerful growl that may be more 'brutal' sounding than that of Johan (first singer) but it doesn't seem like it fits the band as well. Johan had a range of differing vocal styles which made him menacing in his bellowing to a frantic pleading. The emotions of the lyrics and the music were carried so well through BURNING BRIDGES by the vocals that I considered Johan as much important to this bands sound as to that of the Amott brothers guitar wizardry. Arch Enemy is truly in essence a power metal band and using a black metal style of vocals (high pitched screaming) seems a bit over the top. Then again black metal is not my thing. But there are great songs on here, I just wish they kept the same vocalist."
3,Not what I was expecting,"Stigmata and Burning Bridges were both killer so when I picked up Wages Of Sin I expected nothing less.It was a lot less.Missing was a lot of the fast heavy melodic guitair changes and leads and just pure heavyness.Dont get me wrong there are some good songs and some melodic stuff on WOS but it doesnt compare to Stigmata or BB.I like Arch Enemy for its musianship,as for the vocals I am not a fan of either of them but I would have to say that the old singer was better.The second CD has a couple classic Arch Enemy songs on it."
1,Total Crap,Wages of Sin sucks compared to any of Arch Enemy's previous albums. The new singer really bad. This is an album for someone new to metal...hopefully you are smart enough and will realise this is just another crappy melo death album by the worlds worst melo death band.
5,Skip-B0,"We love this game. It is similar to Flinch, but much more interesting and more strategy. It can be played at different levels, so it can be fun, even with a 1st grader. (Such a relief from Candy Land!) We currently play it with a 4th grader, a young adult and two grandparents and have great fun. It is a great mix of luck and strategy. Our only question is: Why is it called Skip-Bo?"
4,Fun for the whole family!,"We play this game with my youngest daughter (6 yrs old when she started playing it), my grandmother, and all ages in between. And we don't even have to give the young/old breaks, they can beat us middle-agers on their own!!!"
4,Nice little mystery,"I liked this book. I read a lot of books from Norway. This was a fun little mystery trying to figure out the identity of the bones. I did, of course, but the little twist was unexpected and fun. There was a lot of tension throughout which made it hard to put down, I really wanted to find out what would happen next."
4,Silence of the Grave: A Thriller,"Enjoyed the book, but did have one problem that I found unusual. If I had to put it down for a couple of days, I had trouble remembering who the characters were. It seems, because of the unusual names it would take a while to reestablish the characters in my memory. I've read many translations from different languages and really never had a problem remembering who was who or being able to tell who was male or female. Likewise, the pronunciation of many of the names eluded me. Maybe that's why I couldn't remember them. If I download another of this author's works it may get easier. I'm actually Swedish so it really surprised me that I just couldn't relate to the names at all and would have to backtrack to try and remember who was who. It was a little disruptive."
3,Expected more,This was my first experience with this author. I was disappointed. The story is just not that engaging. The parallel plot motif lessened rather than heightened the suspense.
3,I needed something to read,"Pretty good read, not as exciting as a Nesbo book, but a good book to read for some mind numbing entertainment"
4,great read,Great book to read. Author has a definite hold on his readers with a much more realistic storyline and characters than the unrealistic stories generated by North American authors.
3,It was ok -- I would give it 3.5,So not outstanding but a pretty good read. The author wrote the story in an interesting way by exposing the past and present to the reader in a chronological way that kept you guessing till the end. Worth buying and I'm glad I did.
2,katana case,"The case looks great until you use for a week or two. It scratches easily and has already chipped in a few places. I am very disappointed and will probably have to switch to another, more sturdy case."
1,Inferior Quality,I was disappointed upon opening the package.The mat is very cheap in look and feel for $49.This is something I'd expect to find at Walmart for $12.99.
5,"Invaluable, essential reading for parents of toddlers","Fussbusters On The Go: Strategies by child psychologist and youth services expert Carol Baicker-McKee is an outstanding compilation of effective strategies and ""parent friendly"" games to help make errands, outings, vacations, and general travel with preschool children fun and stress-free. From easy to understand and follow guidelines, to ensuring the little ones get nutritions munchies on the go, to handling separation anxiety and soothing incessant whining, to hygiene tips for staying clean, Fussbusters On The Go is an especially recommended addition to community library Parenting Skills reference collections, as well as invaluable, essential reading for parents of toddlers who have every had to take their child to the dentist, doctor, grocery store, mall shopping, or extended car trips."
1,Retired Army Guy,"The DVD cover for this movie, the one for my movie rental is different that the one shown here, is awesome and the whole reason I chose this movie. The DVD cover is the best thing about this movie. It's terrible in everyway. I love the accents, French, British, American and that's just the over actors playing the Germans. It's cliche, the writing is bad, the actors are bad. The plot is silly. Just don't bother."
4,Very nice smell!!!,"I love the smell of this particular Gucci, I think a little expensive, but what you expect its Gucci, right!"
2,Fair Choice,"This is the least favorite of Jayne Ann Krantz novels. First, The heroine is pushy and bossy. She makes excuses for the rotten way her family cheated and defrauds Travis. What women proposes marriage the first time she sleeps with a guy. Move over Fantasyworld. Travis even though you feel some sympathy for him he is so much a pushover you want to scream. It's hard to like a novel when you don't like the characters. Wait for the next one."
4,An honest political autobiography - you better believe it.,"Peter Walsh was Finance Minister in Australia's Hawke Labor Government in the mid 1980's. He describes himself as a 'failed Finance Minister' because the economy got worse during his time.The book starts with his birth in rural Western Australia in 1935, follows his time through the Whitlam Years, the Fraser Years and the Hawke Years.It is not a comprehensive history of Australian politics during the 1980's. There are other books that do that. This volume is a good report on what happened on the inside.Walsh doesn't change his views after the fact. His recording of history is consistant with what actually happened. It is a refreshing read for people who already know a bit about the Australian Political situation at the time."
3,Curious Claire,"This book is about a girl named Clarissa (Claire) that goes to her grandma's with her mom Janey. They stay there for the whole story except the beginning and the end. Claire finds out about grandpa she didn't know because he's dead. She finds out why he and her mom didn't get along. She also meets her dad that she's never met before and her little brother. She finds out that her little brother has been dealing with leukemia. She deals with the problems of her sick brother, her mom, and dad around each other.I liked that she meets her brother because it's fun to read about. I also liked that Claire meets her dad because he's a real neat part of the book. I didn't like that the book had Claire thinking all the time.I would recommend this book to someone who likes suspense stories. I would also recommend this to someone that likes drama. His is also a real like kind of book."
4,Janey's Girl gets four stars!,"Janey's Girl written by Gayle Friesen is an awesome book. It starts off as Claire (Clarissa) and her mom Jane go to her mom's old house where her grandmother lives. The story evolves around that making a enchanting read. Claire is a spirited girl that hates her mom being so protective. I am not going to say much more because it will ruin the story. This book must be read by girls age eleven and up! Claire's story will keep you glued to the pages, making it a page turner. Gayle Friesen is denfinitly has a great style of writing and a pretty good plot that will want to make you finish the book as quick as possible."
1,"ho, a killer in vietnam",I'll recommend to our vietnamese people to boycott this book and the store which selling this book.
3,wildwood lovin,"Im obsessed with wildwood so anything with wildwood on it, in it - a five foot radius of it - i just drool uncontrollably. This documentary is cool - but I feel like it doesn't do wildwood justice. It's about the kitch design of hotels - not enough history in my opinion. BUT - it does give you the 411 on what hotels are being renovated and preserved. I just bought WILDWOOD DAYS - a pbs special on the groovy NJ hotspot - that's amazing! i had to call the wildwood visitor center to order it. It's a bit pricey but it's sooooo worth it!"
1,i think she should stay at school,i think this cd is absolute a waste of time. i see her lyrics as a way to impress boys but i think they impress preschoolers.her first song strawberry kisses was to childish and influenced me to tell u not to buy this cdi'm not a fan of hers buy better songs its not worth 1 dollar.
1,Lousy service from Macy's and Amazon...I want my money!!!!!!,"I placed an order on september 4 for these shoes and I didnt received them. I wrote to macys and amazon services to explain them about this situation several times and after 2 months, I dont I have a credit nor receive any answer of follow up from either of them. I'm very disappointed of Macy's and Amazon! I write this in the hope to receive my credit back soon, as my mails seem not to work..."
2,Lousy voice makes it all hard to listen to...,"To be fair, I'm not a major New Order fan, but I always liked ""True Faith"" and ""Bizarre Love Triangle"", and found others alright. That being said, given the fact the singer never had a tremendous voice in singing in such a bland way, that concert performances are generally not as well played as original versions, and that these performances add nothing to the original versions in terms of interesting reinterpretations, this performance is dreadful. I've read the band were taking drugs heavily during this 1987 tour. Perhaps this is why the singer's hardly difficult singing is off-tune and lazy throughout. I had to return this awful album. Buy ""Substance"" or the ""International Hits"", maybe even Joy Division's ""Permanent""."
5,Excellent DVD for Osteoporosis Prevention Workout,"Very nice program. Chaptered and easy to use. Pleasant instructor who gives excellent instructions. You need to have a stability ball to use this DVD (but if you don't have one, get one--they're great!) This DVD makes doing your resistance training for osteoporosis prevention very easy to work into you exercise plan. My only slight complaint is that the music is a little odd, but it's very soft and easy to tune out. Good information on osteoporosis. Overall, a really good DVD."
2,I'm not happy with it!,"Elsie Muniz voice is GREAT! But this CD-SINGLE is not the better! I have the MAXI-SINGLE ""Your Eyes"" and its the BETTER! Because that has Victor Calderone Mix! Unhapply the Maxi-Single is not available on Amazon."
5,Very good product,"I had purchased this product before going through any reviews - I must say that I do not regret doing so. I have used this only once to make the lava cake (per product recipe) and it was a hit!Very easy to clean & use (even for novice bakers) - the cakes slid smoothly out of the pan.I am looking forward to using this for making more lava cakes and also mini-cheesecakes.Thanks to the reviewers for completing the missing instruction in the English version of the recipe printed on the rear of the box. I was also able to get an online copy of the recipe. For those who are interested, here's the link [...]"
4,Useful and worth owning,"I own both volumes of Prof Prosp on FIPM and plan to buy the third one as well as soon as it becomes available. With as many books that Fabozzi edits, I don't expect him to do a foreword--his job is to pull together the experts and I think he's done that well. I think the book does a good job of hitting the key issues, and offering a comprehensive overview. It's worth having on the shelf, especially in conjunction with the next volume."
4,"large and a bit odd, but well made","We received this furniture set as part of a furnished Plan Toys dollhouse bundle. All four pieces really have a hard time fitting in the smaller rooms in the dollhouse - you may have to choose between tub and shower. The toilet is a little strange - the lid is a separate piece that just sits on top of the bowl, it isn't hinged or attached in any way. Still, the pieces are solid wood, and if your child is young/recently pooty trained they will love having a bathroom in their dollhouse."
3,Another useful book,"This is a useful guide no doubt, as with many other how-to books, however it's not at all the best I've seen.I'd still recommend getting this book if you are an aspiring artist, because it's always important to stock a library of information within your field(s)."
2,and?,"there are some turning points that don't hold together well - for instance the ending. yawn, are all the women nuts? if so, this bachelor is not toxic and therefore more sympathetic than the title suggests. good style/tone. the ending left me flat and disappointed."
4,Dating from a Man&#65533;s Perspective,"Rick Marin takes the reader through his dating hell with neurotic women, overbearing matchmakers, and well-meaning friends. The author offers an accurate and funny peak at dating in your 30s and beyond. While the setting for this memoir is New York, it could easily have been placed in any cosmopolitan city. The book is often laugh-out-loud funny and sometimes a bit depressing as the author moves from one screwball date to the next. The tone of the book shifts near the end, and Marin grows up a bit. The book's primary weakness is that it doesn't give full shrift to the growth of the author as the book reaches its close. We're not quite sure if the author has truly grown up or just gotten temporarily exhausted of dating nuts."
5,"A hilarious, exhilarating ride through the 1990s","Marin has written a book about men and women that really tells the definitive story about life in the 1990s. It's about the intersection of celebrity culture and the rest of us who aren't celebrities but who feel the need to act like celebrities and live like celebrities in order to have authentic experiences. It's one of the funniest, truest books I've ever read."
1,A face only a mother could love,"I normally don't judge people by their looks, but since Rick Marin seems to be proud to have dumped women for wearing ugly shoes or not having the latest pair of jeans, and his book is full of such judgmental superficiality, he's fair game. So I'll say this: Marin is so bad-looking, no beautiful and self-respecting woman would ever date him. Don't believe me? Check out the images of him in Google, and laugh. Cad? In his dreams..."
1,"The meaning of ""intimacy""","""Women blame men for acting fake.... But women are the ones speeding from zero to intimacy like a Ferrari. Which is more artificial?"" asked Marin in one of his failed attempts at wisdom about dating. He was talking about a girl who had come to visit him from Europe (he invited her), where they had met and had sex, and who didn't like the fact that he was sleeping around.This is the dictionary definition of intimate:(adj.) having, or being likely to cause, a very close friendship or personal or sexual relationshipSo he criticized a girl --and women in general-- for acting as if an intimate act were, well, an intimate act.Marin is not only a jerk but much worse: he's a writer so bad he doesn't even know the meaning of the words he uses."
4,Guilty Pleasure,"It's all true. Every ""NOooo...really??"" fear women have harbored about their man's internal dialog and his lizard-brained motivators is, in fact, well-founded.Mr. Marin's book is funny, well written, and flourescently honest (I give him points for not trying to defend his pathetic behavior).Overall, a blast to read."
3,Garrison Keillor Funny,Funny and entertaining book. It made me think of Garrison Keillor's recent work. But speaking as another DC Elizabeth who had her heart stomped on by a cad it hit too close to home.
1,Terrible,"If you really want to read a book by an obnoxious, arrogant (bordering on delusional) and unattractive man, I suggest you pick up a copy of How to Lose Friends and Alienate People. Its author, Toby Young, shares all those characteristics with Rick Marin, but he also has a sense of humor, which makes How to... a hilarious book, well worth-reading. Cad, on the other hand, is just terrible."
1,Its a bait and switch,They sent the Classic pan not the Noblesse. If there was a zero I would have used it instead of a one star. I returned the pan and purchased it at Chef Central.
2,Avoid this one,"I've bought two of these, one after first wore out after a few months. The latest lasted a few months as well before the clip just broke off. Also, the design caused it to constantly take pictures in the holster (partially the phone's design as well). Go with something else. There is no ratcheting swivel for this, it's a fixed clip which would be great if it didn't break."
1,Could've been good,"This book had potential, but when my 12yr old daughter showed me page 114 describing how the master ""took advantage of her..in the snow. Ripped her skirt off, climbed on her, burying himself in her like a hog in rut."", I was pretty upset. Page 150, ""Caleb drove the stick down and into the man's chest. The man gasped, and gurgled, and spewed blood....he kicked the man off the deck..."
4,Quality item,Solid construction quality. I use this for my Zoom H4N mount on my L-bracket with my Canon 7D
4,Versatile,"Not as well built as I would have expected for the price, but it works. Great for many uses. The bottom part (male shoe insert) unscrews to reveal a 1/4"" tripod socket, so this can be used to add an inexpensive, light-duty ball/swivel head to common tripods.I would love to get my hands on a 3/8"" version of this unit for use with a Rode VMP shotgun mic; for now I'm using a pair of Manfrotto socket adapters to step down to 1/4"" and back up to 3/8""."
4,does what it is supposed to do,I give 4 stars when a product performs as anticipated.. 5 when it goes above and beyond.. Not sure how this item could go above and beyond.. It does just what it is designed to do..
4,Stamps and ink,"Would recommend for anyone who loves to draw. Got it for a cousin age 8, who loves horses and drawing, really enjoying it."
3,Great stamps - Crud pad,"I bought this set knowing that the stamp pads came dry per other reviews, so I wasn't too surprised when mine was dry too. I bought other stamp pads to go with it but I'm still disappointed that a big company like M&D; can't somehow keep their stamp pads wet.The stamps themselves are nice. They're solid wood and rubber so durable. The pictures stamp pretty well.I found the 'storage box' to be a waste of time since there is no lid. We ended up just storing all of ours in a shoe box.Overall worth the $10... If I had paid any more than that I probably would have been a little more upset."
3,Big Disappointment,"I purchased this for my three year old granddaughter to keep her occupied on a long car trip. Imagine her disappointment when she opened it to find the stamp pad which accompanied it was dried up. I read this in other reviews and purchased it anyway because I thought it must have been a fluke. I was wrong. I have purchased dozen of other Melissa and Doug toys for her and have never been displeased with their quality. Unless you purchase another stamp set to go with it, do not buy it. I had one sad little girl on my hands because of this purchase."
5,"Excellent book, very interesting, lots of information, serious, academic.","The Phoenix Fire Mystery is a compillation about major religions and what their viewpoint in reincarnation is. It is very well written, not boring, but directed towards the educated reader in this subject. Reccommended for those who already have read something about reincarnation and are looking for deep knowledge rather than trivial viewpoints."
5,Reincarnation.....a must read,How do the various religions of the world relate to reincarnation? It is amazing....loved the in depth study of reincarnation throughout history and our religions....
2,OUCH!,"First off, this is from a males point of perspective. I have used the basic shaving method for a while now, and I thought trying a wax that is natural, easy removal and a kit that includes the post aftercare would be a great way to get into waxing. HA! First of all, since there is no heating, the wax feels like putting gum in hair. If you dont generate enough heat, the hair WILL NOT COME OFF. Although the product is all natural, if you have sensative skin, I do not recommend this product. The ONLY benefits I give this product is the removal of the access wax on the body washes off easily under warm water, and the aftercare lotion sooths the skin, but does nothing for the irritation. Hope this helps."
4,The only real Java tool,"This is the only 100% standard real Java 2 tool available in the market. The applications can run in any operating system, already tested it, not like MS Visual J++ that only works in Windows. The only drawback is that is too slow and you need to have a super PC to run it efficiently."
4,"Fifth Edition includes coverage for RHEL5, but can't find online extras","I only bought this book a few days ago, so I'll have to update this review when I'm further along. BUT-- one warning: The online appendices (including info on setting up virtual machines using XEN for practice) are nowhere to be found. The link in the book is apparently outdated, and no amount of searching the McGraw Hill website uncovered the downloadable content.I'm sure they'll correct this error eventually, but if you're planning on buying and using this book today, be warned!"
3,help me a little on my exams,well is a good practice for the RH302 exam some chapters are good for practice but others you have many definitions that maybe you said time to sleep :D.
3,Lacks the overall usefulness the first 2 volumes had,"Chicago Chronicles vol. 3 is a decent source for a campaing in chicago, and the added section on milwaukee adds an extra setting. But this volume has rather useless information and things are repeated. the book is tedious and not at all as usefull as the other 2 for shicago by night, but the milwaukee section makes it at least worthwhile. I recommend gamemasters using chicago buy the first 2 books, Chicago Chronicles vol. 1 and 2, but the third is only necessary if you want an added area like milwaukee."
4,Excellent Melodic Hard Rock,"Ok, I am biased, I am a big Tony Martin fan. I also wish that Sabbath kept Mr. Martin. Tony can sing, and Tony will work...Anyway, the songs are great, more like Deep Purple rather than Black Sabbath though. The music is little lighter than the Cage stuff, but very strong. The other comments are pretty accurate, the title track, Why Love and If It Aint Worth Fighting For are the best tunes. All I know is that the disc was going for quite a bit of cash until the rerelease so enjoy! The disc was so rare that Tony Martin himself did not own it! Buy the disc, Tony sings and plays guitar, and he is one of the last great rock vocalists. Guest musicians include the who's who of British rock royalty. Brian May, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray and more."
4,great if you loved the show,this is a good purchase if you are a big fan of the show and want some sew stories. it isnt that well written( obvouisly not by groening). the problem is that the tv shows jokes had a lot to do with timing. thats hard to replicate as a comic.but ienjoyed it being a big fan of the show.for added fun.. read it out loud and try to do the voices.!!!
1,putty,"This stuff is messy, and tacky looking. Not what I thought it would be. Quake Secure is much better (Safe-t-proof) sells this product. I have paranoid parents and they are earthquake, fire, everything prepared and we get our stuff from safe-t-proof"
1,Does not work,"I bought this product, due to a big quake we had here, and looked forward to using it. However, as it turned out, this so called ""museum putty"" does not hold anything! Don't waste your money."
2,it's ok but can't recommend,"Works ok for some items, but not for others. You have to be careful because if the product does not hold up (i.e. holds up for a while but eventually falls down) you can damage whatever it is you're hanging.Thankfully, I hung my stuff up on a carpeted area so my frame was not damaged when it fell overnight while I was sleeping.Can't really recommend since it does not perform consistently. Might as well put a nail in the wall and dry plaster over it if you want to be sure. Otherwise, you may find wall hangings permanently damaged."
5,jinxfactory's views,"I've been following front man Danny Frye for years. His music always strock a ""cord"" with me and my environment. This new album has gone beyond that!!! This music should be played not only loud, but in your car while going 100 miles an hour screaming ""HELL YEAH""!!!! Fist out the window, grippin' through traffic, forgetting the rest of the world! If this CD was a car, it would be a V-12 propelled camaro with wheels of brimstone. Check it out, you won't be disappointed!"
4,Works great!,"I am putting on a new roof and quarter panel on my rx7 project car. There are about 100 spot welds to drill out so I can mig it on. I was able to drill out about 75 of the 100. The tool will only go deep enough to allow your whole about 1/8"" from the edge so if you have to have the edge of your hole any deeper than you are going to have to drill or modify the tool. The is room to modify the tool to allow it to punch holes deeper if you wanted. I wish it had a swivel head. This tool helped out alot and made the process much faster. Kept me from bending alot of metal cause I would have had to press hard on the metal to drill the holes. You dont need a big compressor. I used it with a 5 gallon."
4,Very Good,"For any aficionado to the Samurai history this book is a kind of 'must have'. The book is very complete with many pictures, diagrams and information; however, the only reason why I did not give it the 100% is because this book is not an 'entry level', it is not for the amateur who is just tempting the waters on Samurai history; this book is for someone whom has average to good knowledge on the matter. As a personal suggestion, read the excellent book 'Samurai Source Book' by Stephen Turnbull; there is a section in that book that makes an introduction to the Samurai armor. Once you read it, then go to this book and everything would fall in place, and you'll realize the diversity and uniqueness of the samurai armor and arms."
1,Couldn't toast its way out of a paper bag.,"I have one, very basic requirement of a toaster oven, that it toasts bread. This toaster consistently took two cycles on the darkest toast setting before it would toast the bread to a light golden color. By the time the toast was toasted, it was so completely dried out it was inedible. I don't know how it works as an oven because it was put back in the box and returned after the toast trials."
4,Fun In the Jungle,"Jungle adventure stories have been popular for a long time. Usually the domain of the male e.g. Tarzan, Ramah of the Jungle...even George of the Jungle, Sheena entered the scene in a 1938 comic strip.A beautiful, even voluptuous blonde, she added another element to the jungle adventure that young kids were attracted to naturally but post-pubescent boy perhaps with a hidden agenda.In the 1994 documentary ""Crumb"", R. Crumb revealed that the 1955-56 TV series ""Sheena-Queen of the Jungle"" was key to his sexual awakening. Irish McCalla was the star of that series.Now 16 episodes on 2 discs and comprising about 5 1/2 hours are available for the first time on DVD starring Irish (who went on to become a noted artist).Perhaps not the greatest acting or plot-lines, but certainly not the worst. These shows have an endearing quality - campy and fun."
3,Litter Box,I received product as promised. I have used your product in the past and this was a replacement.I preffered the design on the older models. This one is not made like the older products and I do not feel that this one is going to last as long as my original. It is also smaller than previously models.Van Ness CP5 Sifting Cat Pan/Litter Box with Frame
2,Great concept - but still needs some work!,"I was so excited when this finally arrived in the mail! I have 5 cats and I could not wait for the litterbox job to become quick and easy. I realized after reading other reviews that you either love it or you don't, we'll I don't! The first couple of times were fine, however after that the grate part kept having buildup which meant it had to be scooped or scraped off. When dumping from the sifting grate litter from the buildup spots would fall all over the floor, making a huge mess! I used it for a few days an decided that it was better to scoop and a lot less messy!"
4,The Haunting of swain's Fancy,"this book was a very...um well i dont know its a good book i guess. This story was about a girl going to her fathers house for the summer and finding out that there are ghosts in the house,Who is going to belive her?Who is going to get rid of them?Will she have to do it with her new step siblings Nicole and Peter?Spooky! This book is a cozy spine tingling bed time story!Fun for the whole family.-Becky S.age 12"
4,gem ID made easy,"This book is better geared for more advanced experienced advocates, who have a lab or are interested in setting up a lab. However, I am wanting to get up to this level...so I will be using it as I pursue my education and hobby equipment. You really should have a working vocabulary of gemology before reading this book.The book arrived timely and great condition. I'm very please with the quality and service of the provider. Thank you."
2,Too technical very few pictures or diagrams,I did not like this book. It is not what I expected. There are just a few photographs in the center which do not cover most gemstones and the rest of the book is very technical. I was looking for a book for the layman to help me with amateur collecting and to identify family pieces and things I may come across in shopping. I do not wish to go back to university for a degree in geology etc. and this book would make me try harder to get the basics I am looking for.
3,"Western Culture, Reason and Masculinity",This book explores the way that masculinity has been constructed in Western culture around the primacy of reason. The author argues that only by legitimizing emotion and intuition will Western men be able to liberate themselves from the chains of their own construction (and inheritance). Given this argument the book becomes repetitive. An interesting aspect of the book is the way that it points out how leftist liberation movements in the West made the same mistake of giving primacy to reason and generating suspicion of intuition and emotion that the traditionalists whom they criticized did. In many ways it is a more interesting study of the centrality of the ideal of reason in Western culture than it is a study of masculinity.
1,Paint by numbers formula novel...,"Take one cop with a skeleton in his closet.Add in one attractive love interest for said copAdd in killer that has ingenious way of committing murder.Take cop and love interest. Have them fall in love. Have killer commit murders. Have cop somehow tie in the SUDDEN means by which he identifies the killer with the ghost in his past. Have killer go after love interest. Cop stops killer on his own. The end.I've just described the plot to 99 percent of most thriller/slasher books on the market. This novel falls into that 99 percent...it's so paint by numbers that I was bored not even a third of the way through...and I skipped ahead and yup, the book followed the same formula! Right down to the ending!Take a pass on this one unless you enjoy reading yet another formula-based novel with no redeeming entertainment value."
2,STOOOPP!!!!!!!!!,this is not a hentai this is a live action in which ti has real people please if you have any love for anime do not get this I did not listen to a review and I wasted 50 dollars so this is a friendly warning i know what i m talking about
1,just plain awful,"I'm having a hard time figuring out who the makers of this film think its audience is. I have no objection to x-rated anime, would like to see more, in fact, but the constant rape and rabid misogyny of this turned me way off. Not only that, but the animation is so cheap and stilted and the dubbing so atrocious I can't imagine folks who want to see this sort of stuff enjoying it either. Best to avoid this awful pile of feces."
5,Hooked on Chai,"This is my favorite Chai of all that I have tried, and I think I've tried them all, so I was very sad when I could no longer buy it locally. Thank goodness for Amazon! Pacific Chai is everything a Latte should be -- smooth, creamy, NOT TOO SWEET. It's my morning picker-upper and my after work comfort. Love it!"
3,"Not bad, could be better","The Seiko ThumBoard is a nifty little add-on. I've thrown it in my bag attached to my Visor, and I'm amazed it doesn't pull off or turn itself on. I have small fingers and thought it would be a snap to use. As it turns out, even my small thumbs feel oafish on the board. However, I believe setting the repeat-key setting to slow eliminates any typos. My only complaint is that, like on a regular keyboard, there should be a shift key (and perhaps an FN key) on both sides of the board. Also--I haven't figured out how to make selections from pop up menues. I end up tapping my choice and going on my way. This is still much more convenient than before. I use public transportation and I can't tell you how many times my grafitti markings were turned into jibberish on bumpy bus rides.All in all--a good product. Could I live without it? Sure, but I'm still glad I got it and the price is right."
2,Not for every Visor,"In particular, this won't work with the Visor Prism, and the manufacturer doesn't make one that will. It seems ridiculous, since the connector on the Prism matches the connector on the other models that it does work with.The buttons are also rather small, and not slanted like the ones on a Blackberry.Visor Edge owners are also out of luck, but that makes a little more sense."
5,Best,I don't know if these are still available but they are my favorite kitchen towel I've ever owned.
2,Not for everyone,"Based on glowing reviews, I ordered the Jobri wedge. It arrived promptly in clean packaging but emitted very strong, eye-watering fumes. It was hard as a brick, so no matter which of us tried to use it - it flipped to a peculiar angle and failed to offer support. Everyone in our family has Tempurpedic mattresses, so we are accustomed to memory foam, which can be very hard when it is cold. Since the Jobri Spine Reliever arrived in December, we allowed it to rest at room temp for 24 hours before trying it out. I'm sad to say this wedge is not for everyone and not for every situation. If you are sensitive to fumes, be forewarned. And if you don't keep your house warmer than 68 degrees Fahrenheit, do not expect this particular foam to soften up with room temp alone. We decided to give it two stars because we got it from Amazon, and Amazon delivers quality merchandise promptly and makes returns easy. Ninety-nine percent of what we get from Amazon we love."
2,works OK,"I got this to read and be on my laptop while in bed and it works ok for those. Let me do a quick pros and cons list for you.Pros:- supports well- two inclines are nice for versatility- included pillow works well sometimesCons:- too firm, almost to the point that I want to call it hard- after extended periods of use, my back and neck begin to hurt- the pillow is too small for me- takes up a lot of space when not in useI don't hate this but I wouldn't buy it again and don't recommend it. It just wasn't what I was expecting and doesn't cut it for me."
3,Expensive and not really worth the money,I bought this wedge in hopes of being able to relieve my wife from her pain that she has with her shoulder and providing some relief as she reads. Probably a decent product and for those that suffer from back injury it may do the trick. The cons that I have with the pillow are that it has you sitting up almost like you were at the dinner table and flipping the pillow the other direction in a queen sized bed is not a good solution...takes up too much room. The other issue is with the little pillow that attaches by velcro to the larger unit; it doesnlt always stay in place because it dangles like a pendulum. Would have been better to put the velcro on the little pillow and allow positioning that way.
4,Ahhhhh!,"I LOVE this wedge! I've had such terrible acid reflux on a couple of occasions that I literally thought I was having a heart attack. Went to ER first time, due to heart disease in my family. Tests confirmed it was not heart, kidneys, gallbladder or spleen and concluded that it was a really bad heartburn.That is why I bought this wedge. Now I can rest & relax into sleep without fear and anxiety or pain and suffering over the gastric disturbance. The wedge can be positioned in either direction for more or less incline, as desired. I often place a pillow on top of the wedge for a softer incline.I aired the wedge outside in sunlight for about 6 hrs when it first arrived and I have NEVER had any out-gassing from the product.Thank You, Jobri!"
5,Excellent Seller,"I made the mistake of buying the wrong size shelf bracket and they quickly provided me with a full refund including shipping. You can't get better than that when the mistake is your own, great seller!"
4,Sipple2004,This was a pretty good PPV. Of course the big deal about this PPV was the CM Punk vs. Triple H match. It was an awesome match as expected. Another big deal about that night was after 15 long years Mark Henry finally wins his first World Heavyweight Title. Also was a great match between John Cena vs. Alberto Del Rio. John Cena puts on some good matches when he wants to. It had a pretty good undercard on it too. With matches like a fatal 4 way match for the US title. And Cody Rhodes vs. Ted Dibiase for the IC Championship. Also Beth Phoenix vs. Kelly Kelly and Air Boom vs. Awesome Truth. Special features include the contract signing for the match between CM Punk vs. Triple H. All in all a great PPV and for the price it's not bad to own a night of WWE history.
1,Guess Who's Review,I personally did not like this book. It was kind of corny. There was no punch line to it. At least I thought there wasn't. I like intimate relationship books and this SUKED!
3,The people's Tycoon Henry Ford,"I see this book as a sort of biography, it cover Henry Ford's life chronologically but also jumps around quite a bit going from say 1920's back to 1910 to reiterate a point. It gives little coverage to the technical aspects of his cars or other manufactured goods like tractors and tanks.The book seems to repeat issues over and over again perhaps with slightly different wording, but too much for me.I remember two sayings attributed to Ford ""You can have any colour you like as long as its black"" and ""I only want to make $1 per car but I will make millions of cars"" these are not mentioned in the book, perhaps they were untrue.The technical production of the electronic version of the book leaves a bit to be desired, many words are strangely hyphenated e.g. un-true would be typical.Overall I think it does give a fair picture of his make up and beliefs."
5,"Wonderful instrument to learn on, beautiful for display","I ordered this violin when it was only $99.99, and was amazed at the quality as was my instructor when it arived. I was a little disappointed at the amount of time it took for shipping and the condition of the external packaging on arival, however, the contents were intact and in perfect condition when I opened the box.My only problem was with tuning the instrument. The pegs slipped quite a bit and I did have to visit my local music supply store to purchase peg drops which did work wonderfully. My instructor informed me that this happens with almost every new instrument so I suggest that when you aquire any new violin, invest in some peg drops as well.The sound quality was really good, (at least when my instructor plays it), and I was really impressed with the beauty and craftsmanship of the woodworking in the instrument itself. I am sure it will remain in our family for a long time as my five year old is taking an interest in music as well."
5,Not helpful for exorcisms,"I purchased this book hoping to learn how to access and manipulate divine power. I thought it would be fun to exorcise demons from my friends or shoot lightning bolts out of my nostrils. Sadly this is not a practical book. Sure, Barnes traces the development of a technical, philosophical understanding of ""power"" as concomitant with an existent's nature and demonstrates how this is used in trinitarian disputes of the fourth century. But that does little to help me part the water at my local swimming pool or cure my uncle's polyps."
2,A word of caution...,"I will agree that this product works in the short-term. However, I would encourage all parents to google Miralax and the P.E.G. contained in it. I have a problem with physicians who discourage parents from doing any research on medications they recommend. Knowledge is power. I'm very thankful for doctors, but I'm not one to stick my head in the sand and close my eyes to other sources of information. As another person has commented on a review below, there is medical info. that overusing this product can cause Miralax toxicity and resulting complications.I used this product with my daughter and it worked...I was told I could continue to use it long term. Due to my own research, I have chosen other alternatives for long-term solutions. (diet makes a huge difference) Good health to everyone."
5,Amazing,"THIS DAY was truly amazing- more insightful and much funnier than I had expected even though I had glowing reviews from a few friends. Such a strong combination of honesty, wit, and sincerity-- this is my favorite read this year."
3,Wand,"The wand was intended as a toy, not for education, so the rating does not state how much much excitement and joy it gave my great niece. So although the rating above are not that high, they would be if asked about the enjoyment this item brought."
5,A Must Read For Any Fan of Leo and The Gang!,"I could not put this book down. A hilarious, horrible white knuckle roller coaster ride through the life of Leo Gorcey and his son. Leo Jr. holds nothing back as he takes you inside the private world of the Dead End Kid. He packs a serious emotional wallop into the 293 pages of his book. He is as honest, real and gritty as it gets."
3,WARNING NON-MUSLIM WOMEN ABOUT ISLAM,"This book was written by the point of view of aChristian leaving her religion, and getting involved with a Muslim man.as a non- christian, & non-Muslim it was interesting,somewhat amusing. maybe this book will wake upsome desperate, & lacking in good common sencewestern women."
5,"We Procede On, Songs of Lewis and Clark","This was an excelent CD, which I would recomend to anyone seaking a CD to listen to while drifting of into a deep sleep, or a nice CD to listen to driving. I have listened it a number of times and never gotten bored of it, or wanted to switch the CD. I would highly recomend this CD to anyone and everyone, it truely is a fine collection of music."
5,"T-Birds great newcoming on this stelar ""LIVE"" performance!!!","This is undoubtedly one of the best ""Live"" performances released in years!!Scorched set,with clarity sound;Kim Wilson at his best;Kid Ramos;Campbell;Hodges;and stupendous performance of this genius of barrel-house piano,Gene Taylor!!This is T-Birds as it must be,really the best blues-rock band in activity!!!Nothing more;Just listen to this sound,and.....OHHHH!!!!!Great revival, T-Birds,and all of your fans are happierrrrr!!!!Congratulations to all of this Fabulous Band,specially in the person of Kim Wilson!!!"
2,Highly Overpriced,"This tiny book does address the issue of lending to subprime market, but it is severely overpriced. It is a collection of papers on topic lending to subprime market. You can do much better with Managing Consumer Lending Business from David Lawrence, you get more information than here, plus the book is much better organized and easier to read. I was dissapointed."
3,It's alright...,"What is good about Veet is that it leaves your skin very smooth. But the stench is nearly unbearable, and it feels like rubber after you have rubbed it on your skin. I only put up with it because it does leave your skin smooth."
1,Defective and not as pictured,"Fist the cable is not as listed. Cable is 4"" long, not 6"".Second the cable was defective.Cable was bought to replace a missing one for an action replay ds, upon attempting to use it the device would not connect(tried on several computers and in several ports). After leaving it plugged in for 3-5 minuets the entire cable was extremely hot to the touch.Not worth returning, as it costs more for the shipping then the actual cable.I'd suggest looking else where, as you get what you pay for."
2,Problematic Stroller,"We bought this stroller for our new born, and have been using it for 2 months and half. The zipper of the canopy already broke after few uses. The stroller is not easy to fold and open - certainly not a one handed job as it advertised. Also, don't expect to fold it flat and compactly - it's a big stroller and it's not light as you may think. Drink holder is very small, only holds bottle water, you can't put your ice coffee cup in there. However, it is a well balanced stroller."
1,Don't Buy This Keyboard Unless...,"My advice is to NOT buy this keyboard, even for $10.You must install the drivers for the keyboard onto your PDA; the only problem with doing this is that the drivers to be loaded come ON A FLOPPY DISC!!!How many customers still have a computer that still accepts floppies? I sure don't, so now I have a $10 mini boat anchor or coaster."
3,Full size spatula,"not the largest, but this is a full size (large) spatula -- not a small one as described in some reviews."
5,I use this with everything!,"I did not think I would love this product as much as I actually now do! I'm a first time silicone buyer. I bought it to use in my 12"" Green Earth Frying Pan by Ozeri and have ended up using it in every pan I own for everything! I've left it in oil and it lived! I've left it in the pan on accident multiple times now and it was fine! This little turner can take a major beating! It's thick, has a VERY good grip, and can lift quite a bit of weight without bending. I've pressed burgers, flipped eggs. Very very good purchase! Silicone really is better!"
2,OXO Good Grips Silicone Flexible Turner,"Oooh, the front corners of the silicone spatula broke off the steel reinforcements in a short time. I have contacted Oxo about it and will let you know how it goes."
4,I can't chop with it but it's strong enough to flip too large pancakes.,I got this for my nonstick pancake pan and it works fine as a flipper but it's sides cannot chop down and separate food so you would need to do proper food prep and not expect to do any separation during the cooking process.
2,I need to get out more.,"I purchased this to have a thin but sturdy non stick turner to fry eggs on my new non stick stove top grill/griddle, I wish I would have gone with a nylon one, I do not see this lasting very long."
1,Doesn't Last - Believe The Other Reviews!!!!,"This was a great spatula until yesterday, when we noticed the silicone had torn and the metal underneath was exposed. I came to Amazon looking for a replacement and thought I'd check out the reviews of my former spatula. To my surprise it seems like other people have had the exact same experience as me. I do not recommend this spatula at all. Yes, it worked great for awhile but now I'm very disappointed and spatula-less (and there are homemade sourdough pancakes to flip this morning!). For me it's not enough for the product to work great for a short period of time and then break. I don't want to buy one of these every 9 months or so - shouldn't a spatula last longer than that at least? Well, I'm off to do research on Amazon and buy a new spatula, one that will hopefully last longer than this Oxo piece of junk."
2,"Interesting, but useless","I bought this book for my daughter. The idea was that she was really into forensics and wanted to learn more about the subject. Unfortunately, this book was so bad, she never finished it. I gave it to her as a research tool, and within a few weeks, she'd discovered so much from other sources that she started to doubt how informed this book was. She said it started out interesting, but as she learned more, the factual errors and inconsistencies drove her away from the book. She's still following forensics, but this book is not on her reading list."
4,Good Overview,"This book presents a good overview of forensics but I do find myself hoping for something somewhat more comprehensive. While it offers a good introduction, those who are more sincerely fascinated with forensics will find themselves searching for some more grounded and in-depth explorations of forensics."
2,Antiquated,The age of Don Draper-like living where you drink hard and play harder seems a bit long gone. Men today are less frequently having the bachelor parties idealized by the movie of the same name. So reading this book felt very silly. I bought it when I was going to be the best man at my friend's wedding. Not one bit of advice in this book was useful. We don't live in the swinging 60s. The book should be revised to reflect the new millenium.
5,BRILLIANT,"this book is a must-read before and while planning any bachelor party. there are many books out there w/ sound advice on how to plan a bachelor party, but none w/ this kind of insight and humor. just like the title reads, from simple to sinful, all levels of bachelor gatherings are covered. and the approach and delivery of the material from playboy is unexpectedly mild-mannered and mature, even when advising on sinful extravaganzas. it is also very informative and full of helpful (and essential) information. this was my handbook throughout the planning process of my brother's bachelor party and i can say w/out a doubt that it paid off. i will consult this book again..."
4,Sync on the go!,"The USB HotSync cable is wonderful on the go -- and is a great alternative to having a cradle at home and a cradle at the office! Don't get me wrong -- I love my USB cradle! -- but the cable allows for portability when traveling, as well as a quick sync with my laptop in seconds. Buy it -- shoot, buy one for your laptop bag and one for just in case!"
1,Palm Recharging USB Hotsync Cable,This cable does not fit the M130 as promised it will not charge it becasue it doesn't even fit it!
5,Best Book to pass A+,This book is very well written with a lot of pictures and examples. Mike makes hard ideas extremely easy with his wonderful real life analogies. I think if you read this book and do practice exams on the CD then pass is guarantied.
4,Easy reading,"The author has a pleasant way of presenting the content of the book.This book, contrary to other books,has lots of photographs to give the reader an adequate visual concept of what to look for.The glossery section is good,yet a little too compact at times.This book has more ""how to "" sections than most books I've read.Personally I would like to see a more info on networking."
4,Not the Hollywood Version,"If the picture on the slipcase is correct, this tape is not the American version with Freddy Bartholomew as Scud East. It's the British with John Howard Davies as Tom Brown. JH Davies played Oliver Twist in the David Lean film of the novel. He may have been a good kid actor, but he's altogether too delicate to be a credible Tom Brown, especially in the fight with Flashman. For the differences between the two, check Amazon's Internet Movie Database. There's usually a link at the bottom of the page. If one interested, it might be good idea to buy it since it's not as well known and may not available on home video later."
1,Not what I was expecting,Boring and not helpful if you wanted something to inspire discussion or intimacy. We only read the first two pages.
1,Strange setup,"I returned this in under an hour. The way it was set up was confusing at best, incomprehensible at worst. I don't know how it was possible to make a simple phrasebook difficult to use, but if there was a contest to see who's could be worst, this one would win hands down!"
1,The predictions of Dimde have no connections to Nostradamus.,"Dimde gives an very interesting look into the future. Perhaps some of his predictions will be true. But, unfortunately, these predictions are his personal opinions about the future. There is no any connection between these predictions and the unknown intentions of Nostradamus. In order to get the explanation of my statement, please look to my web-page (only in german). To get the address, please send me an e-mail."
1,bad description,"description said pant would fit 40-42"" waist. It was way too small. My husband needs 42. I measured the maximum waist stretched out as far as possible and it only measured 40I was disappointed I had to pay return postage on an item that was not described accurately."
2,"Starting from scratch? This'll work, otherwise don't bother","This is an OK book if you want to get a handle on how to install a secure server only. If you already have a server that is installed and configured, you won't find this book that useful. THe author, tells you all kinds of things not to do that I had already done, and going back to the beginning on all that stuff is way too much of a bother. THis is also NOT a book on how to set up a secure web server, but rather a secure domain server. Don't buy this book thinking you will secure your website as I did, because if you do you will be disappointed. I can sum this book up in one or two sentences. Turn off all your services, disconnect it from any and all cables, do not assign any administrator users, do not allow anyone to log on, oh yeah and do not turn the power on and then only then will you have a secure server. It is full of impractical suggestions such as those, what a joke."
4,stockings,"the fit was good, but the tops tended to roll down a bit so they were not perfect. but they worked!"
5,Stockings,I adore these stockings! the fit very comfortably and are made of a nice thick soft material (thick enough not to snag easily yet not so thick that they would make you sweat). I am 5'4 and they are the perfect fit thigh high stockings as advertised. Shipping was very prompt and the price is just excellent.
3,Its okay for price.,"I just received and tried it on. I think because its a one fits all its kind of tight. It has the potential to start rolling down your legs. I ordered it in black and it looks nice, its dark just the way I like it. This is my first time purchasing thigh-highs. I also purchased Hue Women's Sheer French Lace Thigh Hi in black. I would recommend the Hue because it has band that helps it stay put on your thigh."
1,Don't buy these; a waste of money,They do not stay up on the leg because the fabric around the elastic band does not allow a good grasp of the leg.
1,WASH prior to wearing!,"Do NOT wear these (any color I suspect) without washing if you have sensitive skin! I wore these for my daughter's wedding because I must have something under my braces--unfortunately the die used in the 'nylons' gave me a horrible rash that I am still recovering from (6 weeks later!) I actually had to stop wearing my braces (without which I can barely walk)for several weeks, and can still only wear them intermittently because the rash is not completely healed! ARRRRGGGHHHH! Toxic die...?"
3,Too short to wear with Leg Avenue costume...,"I bought this to go with a red riding hood costume from Leg Avenue. The stockings were too short for the garters, which stinks. Admittedly, I am 5'7"" and weigh 140lbs, but normally one sizes fit me fine. They just don't go up high enough for the garters. Otherwise these would be a great product. The reason I am giving it a 3 instead of a 4, is because I think the company should make these long enough to go with their own products (or list the heights that it would work with) to avoid these types of issues."
3,Not Dunne's Best,"If you are a Dominick Dunne fan, this is one you can get around to after you've finished The Two Mrs. Grenvilles and People Like Us. Or if you just like you fictionalized true life crime set in L.A. Having grown up in L.A., I appreciated the setting and some of the delicious details of the scandal surrounding Vicki Morgan, Alfred Bloomingdale's mistress, but I thought this story was not in the same league as some of Dunne's other books. In fact, the only thing that really did stay with me was the tidbit, possibly true, that Alfred's wife, Betsy, could plan an entire cocktail party in her head while adoringly pretending to listen to her millionaire husband talk about his day. That brought a chuckle."
5,A masterful analysis of JFK's presidency,"Reeves, with his masterful writing and poignant details, offers a great read into the trials and tribulations of the Kennedy presidency. He probes the issues enough for the reader to gain a factual bases of an event, but allows the reader to make up his own mind about the truth. He leaves the reader with a deep sense of knowledge, yet with a respectable level of intrigue into Kennedy, his cabinet, and the events that dominated his presidency."
4,A Crossroad of Biography and Fiction,"I read this book a couple years ago and was truly impressed. It not only presents the years of the Kennedy Administration in a well researched informative manner, but also tells the story in a rich fictional prose worthy of John Updike. This is an entraining read for those who gravitate towards biographies and even those who do not."
2,The worst TF ever,As soon as I purchased this toy the wings fell off. I called my friend up since hes good with this and he said his wings fell off too.If you still want bumble bee I highly reccomend the o8 camaro design
4,"Not as good as some, but still good.","I absolutely love the older Tiger Army. I have enjoyed this album, but it's certainly not as good as the previous albums. This album is much more ""clean"" than others. In other words, you can hear the influence the studio guys have had on the music. There are a handful of decent songs, but if you're just getting into Tiger Army, start with their older works first. If you're a Tiger Army fan, you should already have this in your collection.FTW!"
2,Not a great taste at all,The chocolate flavor is not strong enough so the whey overpowers it. It has a mealy texture and a weird aftertaste. I will not buy this one again. I preferred Champion's Whey Protein Stack in Chocolate. Much better!
5,Delicious low-sugar protein!,"This is undoubtedly my favorite protein. The vanilla flavor is great mixed even just with water, but with coconut milk is my favorite! It is low sugar, but doesn't have a strange artificial flavor that so many proteins have. It is great blended into smoothies with fruit or just on it's own. I've even added it to iced coffees to give my morning drink some additional protein!"
5,"Whey Factors, waaaay better than most other protein brands","I have been using Whey Factors for a number of months, on a daily basis as a part of my diet/exercise regimen. I have seen notable improvements in appearance and endurance, which I attribute partly to using this product daily with breakfast, and after work outs and cycling.Extremely satisfied overall, the only minor fault I found is using this with cold milk/juice, it tends to clump easily. Again, given the price advantage over retail stores in my area, it is an extremely good deal. Shipping is freaky fast as well."
3,Waiting room at the Dentist,"If your a big sublime punk rock fan, this might not be the album for you. This album is nice and laid back. It's got the feeling of sitting in the waiting room at the dentist. If that's a good analogy. I've enjoyed it for it's jazzy style. Burritos was slowed way down, and I've enjoyed it more than the original."
4,The Requiem of a Prodigy,"Overall my opinion is that the cd is good. I do think that if you are a huge sublime fan and you worship anything that has to do with sublime, you should definitely add this to your collection unless you hate jazz with a passion. To people who wasn't expecting a jazz cd--LOOK AT WHAT YOU'RE BUYING! I mean it says the Lounge Brigade and Gringo Floyd. Of course it's not punk bands. Listen to the mp3. I, myself, like jazz. And to hear a jazz version of sublime is sublime itself. The Lounge Brigade is ok, but Gringo Floyd is great. Yes that keyboarder is in the zone.My favorites:What I got40 oz of FreedomSanteriaWhat's with under my voodoo? This version doesn't really sound like it. Also I would've rather had another song like chica me tipos."
1,"They tried, but didn't quite make it","The people behind this lounge tribute cd had very good intentions. Its just that the quality and resemblence to sublime is very low. I have been a sublime freak, and probably have heard close to every recording make from these guys- including the 50+ live shows. Sublime is not this music- and never was either. Some tracks actually some similar to some songs, which is why I gave it the one star. I would not recommend buying this album if you like sublime- buy it if you enjoy low quailty jazz music. To quote another reviewer- Bradley Nowell would roll over in his grave if he heard this cd."
4,"Sublime are better, yet this is worth listening to","If you're a huge Sublime fan, I don't think you should buy this. Yet it is a good CD to listen to. It's the type of music that is played in a posh pub. If you want to buy this, I reccomend WHAT I GOT, 40 OUNCES 2 3DOM and WHAT HAPPENED. Not the type to listen to in your car, the type to relax to."
3,Love the retractable USB cable but the charger broke on 2nd use,"Buy the retractable USB cable separately. You'll be glad you did. The charger took FOREVER to charge my MP3 player in a wall outlet the first time I used it (didn't even get a full charge from not quite empty overnight) & broke (the plastic attaching the metal prongs to the unit) the second time, when I tried to plug it back in to keep charging after seeing how little progress it made the first time.It might still work in the car. Not sure - I haven't tried it. I was too upset with the wall plug breaking because it happened while I was traveling for work & I had no other option to charge my MP3 player for the flight back but to bring it to the office with me & find a spare computer to plug it into. Fortunately, the USB cable works great & it was fully charged in less than 2 hrs. The charger is still in my suitcase in a closet."
2,Think Twice,"I used this book alone to study for the CISSP exam. It didn't come close to preparing me. The questions on the exam were much harder. There are not enough sample questions in this book.And the questions on the free on-line practice exam are too easy. After taking the exam (which I didn't pass), I couldn't recall a single question from the book that was on the exam."
1,Waste of Money and Time,"This rod is worthless junk. A stick and string will get you better results without one tenth of the aggravation. A complete waste of money, unless you need to give a novelty gift to someone you really don't like."
3,pen fishing pole,"this fishing pole is really neat.the reel is really well made and the the eye's on the pole are nylon coated.the only complaint i have is how the reel attach's to the pole.if they would have put as much thought into it as they did the reel and pole it would be fantastic, but as it is i have to tighten it up constantly.this is the only place that the material they used could have been better, other than that it is a superb product and really catch's fish."
1,The blues,"The story revolves around Vivian (Erica Prior) falling for multi-billionare Henry Brooke (Shane Brolly).They get together, caress and kiss a lot before something always makes her spin off into new 'adventures'. He chases after her, in fact at one point he busts her out of jail.It makes no sense at all. There's a great deal of nudity (except by the main characters), very little sex. The nudity has almost no context to the storyline. For instance Maria (Summer Altice) a driver brings Vivian to the luxury super-boat of Brooke. They both eye off Brooke who has lots of women spinning around him and there's flashes of naked flesh as perhaps either Maria or Vivian, or perhaps both imagine what he's like in bed.The locations are great, and exotic. The plot is poor. I don't know about the 'episodes' that are supposed to be contained in [...], the DVD I got here was a single disc showing a movie that goes almost 1hr 40mins."
1,Silly skin flick,"I see, by the date of the last review, that this film has been correctly overlooked for three years. A twelve-year-old boy might enjoy this film because there are pretty, naked girls in it. All the rest is silly caricature, less real than the least-believable soap opera."
1,A japanese disgrace,"This book is such an insult to any intelligent human being who has read anything about the attrocities of the Japanese army during WWII that is should be banned as a hate crime. it is even worse than Takemoto's idiotic book ""The Alleged Rape of Nanking""i think the writers of the positive reviews of this tripe should be forced to read the actual books of this story and made to confess that they are agents of the government that denies Jap attrocities during and before WWII.This book is a sick and outrageous denial of real history. The authors should do the honorable thing and use their sword on themselves to show us how Hara Kiri really works. Of course a bamboo sword, which is not very sharp, would be the honorable way out."
1,heartless bastards,"Japan has committed some of the world's worst atrocities in history (nanking massacre, unit 731, batton death march, comfort women, pearl harbor, ect..) and they still refuse to apologize, compensate, or make an accurate history in there textbooks. Why is Japan so cowardly and instead try to make their amends to their victims of the horrible crimes against humanity. No wonder people call Japan a ""devil"" race."
1,Play Devil's Advocate if you must.,"I have just finished reading this book, and I recommend it as as supplementary reading to Iris Chang's book about the Japanese occupation of Nanking, only because Tanaka Masaaki attempts to show the proverbial other side of the coin.Personally, I believe both books got bogged down by presenting history in terms of numbers. Imperial Japanese forces perpetrated atrocities in Nanking, like they did years later in Singapore, Burma, and Manila - there is no denying that.( Whether the overwhelming evidence to support this is classified by Japanese history as ""military operations"" is a totally separate subject.) But how many casualties constitute a massacre? Is the death toll really significant? To (mis)quote Mao Tse Tung, "" one death is a tragedy; one thousand deaths is just a statistic"".Anyway, play Devil's Advocate, read the book, and keep an open mind."
5,Excellent book on fine-tuning Windows!,This book has a huge collection of excellent tips for getting the most out of Windows. Every Windows owner owes it to themselves to go out and get this book!
1,Remastering an old recording,"If you want to experience how Beethoven was played 40 years ago, then buy this CD set. But beware of sound quality and some technical glitches. In addition, audience noise can be distracting."
3,not happy,"the materials used in this toy are not very durable. the beginning beader has trouble with some of the thinner beads breaking while putting the string through. the thicker string and the thicker beads work best. so far, my grandchildren have not been excited about this product. also, the container is not reusable as stated. i had to separate every one of the different beads and put them in plastic bags. then i had to put all the bags in a shoe box. it's another good idea, but it needs to be improved."
5,Good Textbook,"This was a required textbook for my anthropology class, but it still had interesting stories of people and cultures. I liked reading about other cultures different from my own."
3,String Quartet Tribute to Radiohead,"It's not bad. But it's a tribute album. And they are always hard to live up to the original. If you're considering buying this, it's either because you love Radiohead or you love string quartet music. If you're the former, than it's an interesting take on the music but the gimmick wore off for me after one listen. If you're the latter, than I don't know what to tell you. Not bad. Not great. Interesting..."
2,eh. ..,"..not awful by any means and there are very pretty moments, but the overall album just lacks in emotion and depth compared to the original. many times the arrangements are very thin and have to leave out important harmonies and sometimes entire lines. it's still enjoyable, mind you. there's just no thom yorke. the absence of his voice really leaves you wondering what to think. if the makers of this cd read these things, can i offer a suggestion that you get a whole string choir with lots of members to beef up some sections and bring back a few things that had to be left out because of your numbers if you ever want to do more radiohead. and get the real man for the melodies."
2,This is NOT a tribute...,"...Why not?, because when you hear the whole cd you know that this String Quartet has been ""paid"" to make this cd. They aren't RH fans. They play each song note by note on violin, viola and cello without any innovation (just listen to No Surprises).Someone wrote on another review that you need an orchestra to play radiohead, and definitely he/she doesn't know anything about music. Just check out the Christopher O'Riley's webpage for some great piano versions of RH's songs or buy ""Inquisition Symphony"" by Apocalyptica to learn what a real String Quartet (only cello) can do."
2,If you are new to managing a group of web developers maybe..,"The only person I'd recommend this book to is a person that is going to manage a group of web developers, and only then if you don't have prior web development experience!As far as the Sybase keyword in the title, forget it! The best you get is a 2 year old copy of Sybase Product literature.... The Sybase Tool Info is all outdated.There is a small amount of info that might be good concept material for a new web developer, nothing that couldn't be easily learned on some of the helpful websites.Take note, THERE IS NO source code in the book, and little or no consideration for the UNIX user...I would recommend your money be spent elsewhere..."
3,"Worked great but wires broke, trying out warranty","This is the best hand-held slicer I've had. Its weight, size, design and sturdiness makes it easy to use. I bought this because it has a 5-yr warranty and I was tired of buying new cheese slicers all the time because of wires breaking. The first wire broke about 3 months after purchase. The replacement wire lasted 6 months. The replacement wire is hard to get in but once I got a pair of needle-nose pliers to help get the 2nd side in...no problem.I just made an online claim and as long as they honor the claim and send me a replacement slicer or wires I'll be happy."
5,HP is the Best and I love this Printer,"If you need quality prints, there is nothing better than the HP Color LaserJet Printer 1600. Best for the price and the best overall. I have A B&W LaserJet 4p and have owned it for over 20 years and it keeps working. I have had this printer for over a year without any problems. Very nice colar, fast, self adjusting."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this printer believing that I was getting a good deal on a cost-effective, efficient printer. I was disappointed on several fronts. First, the print quality was poor, with smudges that no fix suggested by the trouble shooting materials were able to eliminate. Secondly, all purchasers should be very aware that the printer comes with toner cartridges that only produce 1000 pages. Replacement toner was quite expensive (nearly $300 for a full set), basically erasing any ""value"" I thought I might be getting on the product. I returned the printer after less than three weeks and dusted off my older black and white laser printer. By the time all of the actual cost of this printer are added up, the buyer would do better to purchase five decent color injet printers."
1,Cannot network connect it .,"This is a very strange result. If one uses a Linksys psus4 printer server the OS (Vista) recognizes the device and echos a network name for it; but when you try to install it as a printer the OS echos that it canot find it. What a failure! Do NOT buy this printer. ALSO HP and Linksys are at a loss as to how to fix this.Gripe#2 If you do not set the printer drive for grayscale, the counters on the toner cartridges will decriment. That means that the printer will error out and require you to take the existing cartridges out and replace them even if they are still full of toner(ink). What a waste and expense. There is no way that I know of to get these cartridges' chips to reset to a reasonable value."
2,La-La land,"If anyone could benefit from some exposure to the real world let it be Shoshana Zuboff. While many of her points are insightful, and ring true to the state of institutions, nothing is offered as an example of just how one goes about changing the present state of affairs. And, after spending some 30 years in the corporate sector, a lot needs changing. However, read the book as it does have some interesting points."
5,New hope for the Future,"The Support Economy gives you an insight into what the future might be like and explains why the present is so painful. It is abrilliant historical analysis of how we got here. It is a equally brilliant attempt to define a new future where technology is used to help us gain control of our lives. Agree with this or not it is start of a conversation- one started with the Cluetrain, This is a serious book by serious, experieinced and visionary people. Anyone who argues that individuals deserve respect and to be treated with dignity must be listened to. Don't look for simple answers, be prepared to think, keep an open mind and The Support Economy will sweep you along to a new view of the world business and yourself"
4,Huge great quality,My son loves this present for Christmas. It's huge and is a nice picture The pieces are of a decent quality too
4,4-year old nephew loved it!,"My 4 year old nephew, who is hard to get to sit still, loved this. Vibrant colors, large format. It was a good pick!"
5,excellent purchase.,Product was better than expected. My 3 year old niece loved it. The pieces are easy to read for her and we end up doing it over and over again.
4,Puzzle for two,"I'm pleased with the puzzle. The pieces are large and sturdy. The puzle is long and narrow. Because of the length, my four-year old prefers to have someone working on the puzzle with him."
1,Nothing special,"Well, it's pretty & purple but HUGE and although it says 1875W it barely blows your hair! Feels like one of those low powered blow dryers. Less power than my small portable 1250 watt dryer. Yeah, it's relatively quiet but not silent or anything."
4,Cool puzzle,"I bought this for my cousin's daughter (she's 3). My cousin is an anthropologist turned school-teacher, so she's all about cultural awareness and enrichment activities. They love doing this puzzle together - its a bonding experience, and also educationally stimulating. I'd recommend it - even if you aren't an anthropologist/teacher/super-mom, I bet you'd have a good time with your kids!"
3,Kinda creepy,We didnt really like this doll. Its a bit creepy looking. My daughter did love the baby unicorn it came with.
3,cons outweigh pros,"I consider myself at an intermediate level of fitness.I have the weights workout by this instructor, which is great. Instructor is serious but friendly, which I prefer to peppy and a perma-smile. Two backup ""dancers"" are non-annoying. One dancer shows modified, lower intensity moves.Weights appear to be this instructor's strength. Clear cuing and solid moves with weight recommendations. The cardio portion seemed to be a mess, somehow. I have quite an extensive DVD collection and I am rather used to picking up workout choreography but for some reason I just felt like I was running to catch up the whole time. Probably a combination of rather unusual, comlex combos with minimal or late cuing.Would probably get eaiser as you do the routine again and again but just not really looking forward to it. Cons outweigh pros for me on this one."
5,excellent weight training and core workout,I have several of Kelly's cd's and love her style and kick butt workouts. This one is tough if you use the heavier weights like she suggests and feels so good. In between the weight lifting segments she works your core HARD. It is incredible and it's my favorite part of the workout. She is so motivating and working hard right along with you. I like her occasional grimmaces and grunts when she is stressing that you should be working it hard and feeling it. I have lots of workout cd's and work out 5 - 6 times a week and Kelly is one of my favorite fitness people. All of her workouts are fantastic. This is one of my favorites. There are two 30 min. segments working different areas of the body in case you don't have time to do the full hour.
4,Good primer on Visio 2002,"""Step by Step"" offers a good primer on Visio 2002 for the beginning user. A particular strength was the insight into how this most recent version of the product integrates with XP."
1,No diffuser,The description for this hair dryer states that it has a diffuser.It does not have a diffuser and none is listed on the box.
3,Works well...if you use the right attachment,I have very curly and thick African American hair. When I tried using the comb attachment on this dryer it took a long time to actually get my hair dry and did not straighten my hair...just made it big and poofy.After washing my hair another time I decided to use this dryer again but used the concentrator attachment along with a vent brush instead of the comb attachment to blow dry my hair. The results were great. I only needed to pass the dryer and the brush through each (small) section of hair one time to get it straight.
3,Does NOT include Diffuser,"If you, like me, have curly hair and want this dryer because it comes with the diffuser attachment BEWARE. I order this particular dryer since I used one at a hot springs and fell in love with it since it appeared that the diffuser was part of the package, plus my hair dried quickly without being fried. Then I saw that it was on Amazon and the diffuser is listed in the attachments. After Amazon sent me two (I complained about not getting the diffuser the first time) identical packages (the second one didn't have it either) I finally called Conair directly. After much confusion and way too much time, the woman said she would send me a diffuser, but she didn't know if it was going to fit. I finally got the diffuser from Conair and am finally happy, no thanks to Amazon's strictly email service when problems arise that require a human being with which to relay the details verbally. Whew. What a frickin pain."
3,"Good, but not great","When my Conair IonShine hairdryer broke two months ago, I tried to purchase the exact same model. I liked the way it made my hair look: soft, shiny and without frizz. Although this newer version of the Ion Shine hairdryer should have improved on the preceding models, it falls short of my older version. The switches, which respond to very little pressure, are placed directly where I want to put my hand and it is inevitable that I end up accidentally switching the hairdryer off or changing the heat setting. The hairdryer is also a bit unwieldy if one wants to use the extensions. On the plus side, it speedily dries my hair and leaves it as shiny as my previous Ion Shine."
2,Hate Ionizer hairdryer,"Well, I just do not like the ionizer hairdryers because they do something to my hair that makes my bangs flat and my hair fly away. The force of the hairdryer is half what it used to be. PLEASE Conair, make one that is not an ionizer."
3,good but not great,"I've had this dryer for about a year and share it with my sister. (im a teenager) Although they say you're supposed to be able to listen to music and hear over it because it's so quiet, you can't- it's just as loud as any dryer. The ion technology is good, but I don't notice that much of a difference.Recently, this blowdryer started making weird buzzing noises- I'm asking for a new blowdryer for Christmas. I don't feel this is a great hairdryer, but it's fine.I have thick hair so it takes about 10 minutes (give or take) to dry my hair after I've let it towel dry for a while. The buttons are placed weird and you cannot get a very good grip on it, it's not the lightest of all, but it works.If you're looking for a cheap dryer with ion technology and low and high settings this is probably for you. After a year of this hairdryer, I'm asking for the Vidal Sassoon VS754 blow dryer now.GOOD BUT NOT GREAT"
3,Could be better....,"I find that the on / off switch is in an inconvenient spot, right on the grip handle. I am continuously turning it off by accident as I am drying my hair.Also, there is no ""cool temp"" option.And the power is nothing to write home about."
1,it sucks!,I just bought this dryer today after my other Conair stopped working. It takes SOOOOOOO LONG for me to dry my hair now...i can barely even feel it! It messes up my hair more than my other one did. As for helping my hair......yeah right. Same ole frizzies as always. I'm going to try and take it back.
2,Not as advertised.,"I like that it does make my less frizzy than my previous hair dryer due to the warm heat setting. (Has hot and warm settings.) But the cord is too short - only 5 feet long. Not a ""professional length cord"" as stated in the description. The motor definitely is not quiet either. It has a loud, hollow sound to it. It is full-sized so it is quite bulky and takes up a lot of counter real estate. I was disappointed so ended up returning it."
4,Definitely good but little bulky,"Definitely a good product and I believe in conair quality and realiability. But this hair dryer is little bulkier, otherwise it works great."
2,Meh,"I bought this dryer after getting sick of having to share my old one with 5 other family members. It's neither great nor horrible.It does what it is designed to do - dry hair. That's about where the positives end. The dryer is very heavy and it takes a good seven minutes or so to dry my baby fine, shoulder length hair. The buttons on the dryer are in an awkward place and I'm forever accidentally bumping them and switching the settings or accidentally turning it off, mid-dry. I did not notice any difference in my hair using this dryer with its purported ion technology. The thing that annoys me the most about this dryer is the cord. It's nowhere near long enough for my liking. It's so short that I barely have enough length to dry my hair without sitting down - and I'm 5'3""! Bottom line: If you need ""just"" a hairdryer for a short amount of time and don't care that it's heavy/slow/has a short cord - then this is the dryer for you."
2,Just the hair dryer I wanted .. or was it?,"Initial review: This hair dryer is perfect. It was extremely inexpensive. It's powerful. It has multiple settings. It has a cool shot. It is quiet. Perfect!On second though, however: the operating buttons are awkwardly placed. While trying to dry your hair, your finger will inadvertently keep turning the blower OFF. Extremely poor design."
5,Trailer Jack,"THe product arrived on time and was exactly what I ordered.The jack is installed on my trailer and I just love this jack. Lets see how it holds up over time. But for now, it replaced the old jack and works great.I like the install feature, where it just wraps around the trailer frame at any location and then just bolts on. Did not have to weld it, which saved me about ~150 dollars to have a mechanic do the install"
4,An excellent choice,"I thought this game was excellent. Fun and challenging with plenty of options. Worked fairly well with our Windows 2000 but the turf style made a difference to play quality, with natural turf being the worst and artificial turf the best. Create-A-Team and Player have plenty of options. I thoroughly enjoyed Mini-camp and two minute drills. The Franchise feature is very enjoyable but problems can occur during off season simulation. Amazon's service was good. I found this game very enjoyable and thoroughly reccomend it."
2,HORRIBLE gameplay,"i've bought all the NFL games since 1998, and this one is actually the worse of them all. It has a great franchise mode, but the gameplay is just awful. there are far too many bugs exploited by the computer that result in long BS plays. you will find yourself buying a new controller every week to replace the one you broke against the wall after a 90 yard TD pass on 3rd and 25."
2,Disappointing read from a favorite author.,"Let me start by saying that I love Catherine Anderson. I own almost every book she's ever written, including some out of prints. That said, this book was horrible. I didn't even finish it. I bought it as soon as it came out, really looking forward to Tucker's story. I just don't know what happened to Catherine Anderson. Was she on vacation when this book was written? The plot line was the recycled abused divorced woman rescued by new gallant man. She's done that particular plot several times before, and its worked before. This time it just felt forced, not to mention bad bad bad. I was so disgusted that I had to come on here and warn others away. If you love her, skip this book, you'll continue to love her. If not, be warned to keep your expectations low. This is NOT a typical Catherine Anderson read."
4,Life...,"Life... don't talk to me about life!!This incredibly wonderful and cynical view of intelligent life in the universe is exactly the kind of thing every normal, and supposedly intelligent, lifeform in the universe should take the time to see. From the irreverant shots at alien intelligence to the obvious exposes of human ""intelligence"" this story will titillate and obfusticate most viewers until thier sides ache!!My favorite, and thus the title of my review, is Marvin ""The Paranoid Android"" who's observations about life include ""ignore it or loathe it ... you can't like it!"" have kept me in stitches since I first read the story almost thirty years ago!!Do yourself a favor and get a copy of this one!"
5,Still the best,"This DVD is worth the money. I had an old vhs copy that was pretty worn out so this came just in time. I have a copy of the 2005 movie and frankly, I want my money back. If anything the new movie is a rip-off of this 1981 BBC TV show. Many people put down this version with its cheap effects and all. Well Disney for all its millions of dollars didn""t do much better even with the new technology. The second disc is loaded with extras like interviews and behind the scenes stuff that are actually interesting. Usually the second DVD is pretty much a throw away so it was a pleasent surprise. This set along with the unabridged audiobook read by the author will remain the best things in my collection for years to come."
4,Pro's And Con's,"This is a must-have for all major Hitchiker fans, however if you're the kind of person that picked up the book once or twice-don't get it. The video is full of over-acting and poor special effects. But, if you are a huge fan the excitement of seeing your favorite characters on TV is too good to pass up. So if you're a fan, the pro's outweigh the con's. But if you're not it's vice-versa."
3,Forget the TV just listen...,"The original was written as a radio play for the BBC - get that copy, listen and use your imagination.Rob"
4,Rob Roy - The Highland Rogue by Disney,"When German-born King George I ascends to the throne of England, he appoints as Secretary of State the villianous Duke of Montrose. Montrose's first evil order of business is to suppress the rowdy MacGregor clan and insure their allegiance to the new king. But the devious Secretary of the State underestimates the fervent Scottish pride running deep in the veins of fiery Highlander Rob Roy and his quick-tempered compatriots! An epic, legendary adventure filled with action, conflict, and a dose of bonny romance!Running time - Approximately 84 minutes. ColorGreat for all ages, and historical in its outlook of time in old England."
3,Does not have the depth of Fr. Rohr's usual work.,"I had hoped for more of Father Rohr's enlightenment in Radical Grace: Daily Meditations, but it did not have the depth of his usual work."
5,Better and most useful,"""Secrets and Lies"" by Bruce Schneier taught me that computer security is much more than building better firewalls and managing them well. ""Hacking Exposed"" showed me what that means in practice. Scambray and McClure have all the knowledge and tools to look at the front door of the network, but also know that most hacks come through social engineering, unguarded other entrances, email delivered trojans, and other techniques that bypass the firewall entirely. That's the real world, and they treat it with gusto, vibrancy, and deep understanding. Most computer books are ""just the faqs"" dumps of the subject, with a little organization. These guys put you right inthe middle of things, and their knowledge clearly comes from intense practice, not theory. Dave Burstein"
1,Don't be fooled !,"I excitedly purchased this compilation in hopes of seeing the ""Sphinx Saga"" again. While it's true that these episodes are part of the collection, Marvel RIPS YOU OFF by printing everything in only black and white! Where's the beautiful color images?!It's fine if you don't care, but I think it's too expensive for just black and white.Caveat Emptor (buyer beware!)"
4,"""A DEFINITE KEEPER""","This is a WELL-WRITTEN and VERY INFORMATIVE book of interest to those possessing only a rudimentary knowledge of nutrition and weight-loss strategies.Its only problem is that it's not expansive or comprehensive enough.If it was more in-depth and all-inclusive it would be a top notch book. Despite these ""flaws"",it serves as an EXCELLENT PRIMER for the uninitiated who simply wants to gain valuable insight into a VIABLE FAT LOSS PROGRAM that's easy to follow and guaranteed to work.You will NOT regret buying this book. Combine it with Clark, Brody or KLEINER and you're all set!! It's worth the $, an easy read and PACKED with VALUABLE INFORMATION!A GOOD BOOK!"
3,Not A Great Movie By Any Standard,"This movie was Ok. The Acting Was Good, But The Storyline Was A little Hard To Believe. It WasJust Ok in my opinion. Nothing Great."
3,"It's OK, but gun didn't fit well","Good quality leather, but 1911 didn't fit well and had to force the gun down into the holster before I could snap it closed. Wound up giving it to one of my sons for his off brand 1911."
2,Stan and John Create Surface Tension,"This dvd first caught my eye with high expectations and a low price. The price turned out to be too much. Stan Lee and John Buscema are two of the greatest comic book creators that have ever lived, but this dvd just isn't good enough to meet their standards. It offers much in the way of comic book jargon, but displays each business element very poorly. The main focus of this ""visual"" video is verbal instruction. There is a very limited amount of important hands-on drawing, barely even enough to teach a learning artist anything. I think that HOW TO DRAW COMICS THE MARVEL WAY could have been done a lot better and should offer a great deal more. Unless you are an avid comic book fan, I do not recommend purchasing this dvd. And, even if you are, I would give it some serious thought."
5,Prepare Them!,"Even with a vaccine for Chickenpox, most of the time it isn't required to get them and many children don't. This book helps children understand what chickenpox is and how to deal with it."
2,Know what you're getting into,Full of mistakes... Some were easy for a novice programmer to figure out but as I recall nothing (or at least very little) past like hour 19 worked--not even the examples provided right on the web site. I don't know whether this is because of lack of browser support or mistakes or both. This publisher shows absolutely no shame. Don't publish a new edition if it leaves you off worse than the first one!
4,A bit disappointing,"Technically, this volume is the work of a creative poetic master. Unfortunately, occasionally the craftsmanship shows through to the detriment of the message. I once took a poetry workshop led by Carolyn Forche. A piece of advice that has stuck with me was to read nature guides - learn the names of the plants, the clouds, ... In this volume, I am aware that the poet follows her own advice. Unfortunately, this causes an awareness in the reader of the poet's vocabulary in a distracting sense.I recognize all the reasons reviewers are enchanted by this volume, but I rate it as a small misstep by a wonderful poet."
2,a falling off?,"I was one of the early big fans of Carolyn Forche, and I've waited greedily for each new book (which have been slow in coming!), but I have to say that this one left me disappointed. It seemed as though her hearly passion had turned into a manner, or a stance, or anyway something less felt than ""thought up."""
3,Not QUITE as advertised,"I'm sure this book was thoroughly researched, and it is very entertaining, but I was led to believe by the advertising that it was non- fiction. I was disappointed to learn that the author used known facts AND her imagination in writing this book."
1,Poor Paint Quality,"I was disappointed when I received my picture frame. The painting on the frame looked like a child had done it! There were scratches and small paint splotches. Definitely not high-quality. It probably looks fine from a distance, but up close, you will be disappointed."
2,Not credible,"Although the author is a good story-teller, important pieces of the novel are unrealistic like for eg: character of Ashok does not make sense. She potrays him as a strong and mature person but in the end unmercifully lets down his character. Is she trying to potray that all men are biased and immature in a typical false feministic manner. Also, unbelievable was Sudha's father hiding in disguise as a driver. And what about those ruby mines!"
5,One of the best books I've read in a long time....,"This novel was wonderful! I found myself unable to put the book down as author Banerjee takes you inside the lives of Anju and Sudha and allows you to feel an immediate connection to them. Banerjee does a remarkable job of showing how a woman can break the molds and castings society creates. With a certain sense of innocence, she displays how a woman is strong and independent, yet weak and vulnerable at the same time. With a dramatic surprise ending that brought tears to my eyes, the story makes you appreciate the ""sisters of your heart"" that you have in your own life. This book is a must read and would make a wonderful gift to any girlfriend, mother, or sister."
5,It's not often you find a book like this!,"I have read many, many books in my lifetime, and this one would definitely be in the top 10. What other book combines love, tragedy, mystery, humor, and social defiance into one irresistable story? Divakaruni's descriptions of exotic Calcutta are so supremely detailed that you feel you are there. The way she weaves together the lives of Sudha and Anju, and the secret that comes between them, is incredible. The two Indian cousins have grown up as sisters, until one of them learns this incredible secret. Even as their aranged marriages pull them to opposite ends of the earth, the girls come to realize that in the end, they have only each other to count on. I would reccomend this to anyone who is tired of modern literature being dull and unfulfilling. This will surely fill your heart with such love for the characters that you wish their story would never end."
4,Pleasurable reading,"I always enjoy a novel that transports me, and Sister of My Heart certainly does just that. The intimate look at the lives, loves and hardships of two ""sisters"", Sudha and Anju makes for poignant and entertaining reading. Whenever I read a book about Indian women, even in modern soceity, it always re-emphasizes how different and difficult the lives of women in other cultures can be. While some themes are universal to all women(love, marraige, children), the expectations, rules and traditions that govern women's worlds are vastly diverse. This is a great story to curl up and get lost in."
4,"Spellbinding and poignant, if a tad sudsy.","Divakaruni has composed a beautiful tale about two women whose lives are intertwined. Their loves and fates, and struggles as women make for a wonderful novel. The only drawback for me was a dose of ""magical realism,"" or Bollywood: there are some fairy tale-like aspects of the story. The result isn't great literature, but it is a great read: enjoy!"
2,The song melody is worst,"There sang more like chanting or reading the bible then rock and roll.I can see the audiens sitting down on the floor or standing stilllike a lamb post without any responds to their music except thesecond last song..... if you compare this group with Bad company""merchant cool"" you will known what I mean....Thank youfrom music lover"
5,Listen in DTS,Some of the songs are among the best you'll hear in this format if you use the DTS feature in a good stereo
4,"Amazing, wonderful, fantastic ...","No Yes fan should even think about not owning this.I saw the show in London on this tour and it was truly awe-inspiring. To have this on DVD is a delight.Were it not for two minor gripes I would have awarded 5-stars. Firstly, the mix in some places should have brought the orchestra more to the fore. Typically this occurs when Jon Anderson strums his acoustic guitar - hearing the backing would be much more lovely. Secondly and I hope it's not my DVD player, but the annoying animation icon won't switch off at the outset, despite you programming it that way. Accidentally I found the sub-title button does this properly, so there it is.Otherwise Close to the Edge, Gates of Delirium and Ritual will blow your mind away. The world should be forced to watch and listen, for this is how music should be ..."
2,time for a re-write,"This book is ok as far as it goes,but it concentrates on the traditional aspects of database security; passwords, profiles, roles and privileges etc. As organisations move into web-enabling their databases, these security techniques are shown to be inadequate.Oracle 8i has introduced a stack of new security features, which are not covered in this book, or given a very broad coverage. Issues such as LDAP(Oracle Internet Directory) Advanced Security (the old Advanced Networkiing Option) Schema-less logins, single sign on, preserving user identity, secure application roles and virtual private databases should be addressed to help DBA's and IT managers formulate and plan a security strategy for web-enabled/ multi-tier databases.So the book as it stands is of limited usefulness. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any other texts out there that cover these issues at the moment."
2,Good Book,Good book but now sort of out of date given that Oracle is long past 8.0.4 that this book covers. No discussion concerning 8i and 9i. Needs an update - why hasn't O'Rielly done it yet?
2,Krup's Espresso Review,"We bought this machine (retail price). It worked well for an occasional latte. However, it failed after a few month's use (after warranty). The steamer doesn't work well--either is clogged (despite cleaning) or there isn't enough steam. I bought a better machine--a pump one--at a garge sale for $20 which works much better. I don't like the technolocy of this machine. you have to measure the water to get both the coffee brewed and enough steam for the milk.. I recommend investing in a more advanced machine."
3,"OK machine. Meant for 1-2 people, not multiple servings.","With a little practice and a routine, this machine is pretty easy to use. Others have complained about milk clogging the steamer. I found running some steam into a cup of water will adequately clean it out. For the money, I think this is a great machine.Cons: Steam wand is too close to the body and it is stationary. It is difficult to fit a container for steamed milk. The unit does not come with a metal cup for steamed milk, so this required an additional outlay of about $10. I can make about 20 oz. of cappuccino/mocha in one execution. This ends up being a single serving for myself. You are limited in the amount of espresso and steamed milk (because of wand configuration) you can make in one batch. Therefore, when making drinks for a larger group, you need to run through the routine multiple times. Quite a hassle. If you plan to use while entertaining, look for a different machine."
5,MS Windows 2000 Server Admin companion,"A very comprehensive, in depth book. So far, covers everything I've needed to find. Well written, and a very easy read. It is thick, and not the type of book you would just sit down and read in a few hours, but it's great reference."
5,One of the most complete references about Windows 2000,"This book is one of the most complete Windows 2000 books you could find. I read this book from cover to cover and is a great book to have as a complete Windows 2000 Server reference. Not full on every aspects (if you are looking for clustering configuration, this is not the book to purchase). It covers DHCP, WINS, DNS, Active Directory, Internet Information Services...and the rest of the Windows 2000 features very well. A very thick book, but worth the time."
1,Yecchhh....,"If this is what's considered ""good"" music these days, than the world truly is coming to an end. REPENT!You know, most of these songs are horrid enough to begin with. But make the singer some 45-year-old guy from Pig's Knuckle, AR, and add a bunch of whiny kids to the chorus, and you've done the impossible: you've made them even MORE annoying. Why would anyone want to listen to this? (Not to mention any of the albums from this sorry series?) This is about 35 points below ""low"" in my book. This is a complete insult to all things music. This schlop isn't even deserving of any more of a review than this. I'm through. Next!"
2,"back to the old tried, tired and tested formula again?","After the expansive, psychadelic explorations of their last long play, they're back to the usual 45 second songs, cookie-monster vocals and gutteral, wounding guitars. ""oops, i slayed your family with a loose snag of tree and feasted upon what would've been forensic evidence"" is a slightly self-parodic look upon the genre they helped create, but the rest of the songs here are of no melodic or rhythmnic worth."
1,This CD sucks!!!!!!,The only thing good about this cd is that they to make Brittany Spears' song sound better.
4,Good Concert but not quite as good as Sade Live,"This is a good concert video. For that ultimate DVD ""better than life"" experience get ""Sade Live"""
1,Why the dts symbol but no dts track?,"As a person who revels in great sound, I found the dolby digital sound track flat and lifeless. I searched through every part of the disc for the dts track indicated on the box, but it isn't there! (for those without dts or with a tin ear, dts is usually much clearer and punchy than DD5.1)The 5.1 channel sound is more like 2.1.1.1.1 - there is almost no sound from the front center or the rear channels. My guess is that it is synthesized from a 2 channel original.Video quality is fairly colorless and subdued - which I would have overlooked if the sound had just been awsome.If I can find the receipt, I will be taking this back due to the false advertising of the dts track."
5,The Rock Is Very Live,"They pushed the release date of this DVD back a few times, but now it's out and it was worth the wait. The show is one of the best live shows there is, which is the reason to get this. You want to be able to pop straight to the songs you like in the future easily, and DVD was made for that.The extra features are cute, but not overwhelming: a photo gallery, some short backstage footage (but soundtracked with music, not real-time ambience or talking), the video for ""King of Sorrow"", 5:1 sound optional. Good stuff, but no reason to buy it over video except for the ability to dance around the show at will, which for me is enough. The intro menu is a bit slow because it's fancy and animated, but you won't be on it too often anyway."
5,A very good selection,"This book is a very good beginning for a student interested in urban and regional planning. The selections are great, one example is the classic article from Lindblom ""The science of muddling through"", with several arguments in favor to 'incrementalism'. Another classic is Davidoff's ""Advocacy and pluralism in planning"", and the text from Beauregard, Krumholz, Healy and Harvey."
4,So far so good,"There is nothing fancy about this meter. I bought it to determine if some lumber that I have is dry enough to put through my jointer and planer.I used it on some wood that I knew was dry and it read 8% - which I expected. I tried it on some wet stuff, and it came up with 18%.I have no way of telling how accurate it is, and it only measures in increments of 2%, but I figure that when the wet wood finally reads 8%, it will be ready.This was all that I was looking for, and the only reason that I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because I haven't had it long enough to know if it will stand the test of time."
2,meter review,I thought that the meter was a digital tool. I tested the meter with a professional's meter and the results were totally inconclusive. Each time I use the meter I have to question the reading.
4,Works Just a s good,"This device has the same specs as the one from apple and works just as good. I like the design better because it uses the more traditional laptop power supply design as apposed to the wall wart design that apple uses. It fits perfectly, charges perfectly, and feels well constructed."
1,Not worth the trouble ZERO STARS,"This product is terrible I purchased it for my ibook as listed. When I got the adapter and tried to plug it in the connector was very, very tight. Tried to pull the plug off, the connector came apart. Trust me it's not worth the headache of ruining the ibook. Just by the original adapter and save around a 30.00 mistake.Thanks!"
2,Times have changed,"Given the change in the world since this book was released the plot seems a little dated. Aside from that this book is also probably the most compelling that Clany has witten. It also relies to some extent on characters from past Clancy novels which may it a little confusing for first time readers.I didn't find the plot as entralling or suspensful as other Clancy works like the Hunt for Red October or Clear and Present Danger. I still however enjoy Clancy's writing style and plot development and his high level knowledge of the subject matter.Perhaps the world has moved on too much now for this style of novel to be truely engrossing. It is hard to imagine a world in which the major struggle was the Cold War, yet it once was. Unfortunately that is what happens when you write a book based on current events, when those events change your work dates very quickly."
3,This book was mildly amusing.......,This was not the best Tom Clancy book I've read. But not the worst. It was mildly amusing. Less action then I expected. However when you finaly come to the action parts they are very good. All in all this was a okay book.
4,creepy little short novel....,"This is a well written short novel with many things going for it, ina genre that tries so hard to reinvent itself. Horror, dark fantasy,whatever you call it always has its share each year of classy tales and I would put this one in that easily. I enjoyed the economy of the story, youdon't need to throw in more than needed, this story centers on this onewoman and those close by her(husband, co-workers)and succeeds in inducing an ever increasingscence of malice and dread. Not to give anything away to those interested,its a tight, strange little tale, a nice take on a paranormal-possession subject well written about."
3,Good but . . .,"This is a very good book that kept my attention. However, I think it is a bit thinly written. I appreciate crisp and clean writing as much as anybody. This book however does it at the expense of character though. The plot is mostly a catalogue/checklist of signs of posession that gives the book a plotless feel. On th whole it feels like a long short story."
5,awesome,Sara Gran did a great job. Gets under your skin. Good scare. The only problem is you wish it was longer.
4,Condition of goods,"As always, the product tastes wonderful. However, for the second time, the shipping carton was dented and torn and all the packages of cookies are total crumbs at one end of the package, about 1/4 of the way down. Something should be done about the way this product is packaged for shipping."
5,Maximum Security,"Magnificent job on the books, each chapter taught me new lessons to secure our network! The authors of the book did an excellent job most definitely a top security book to be on everyone's book shelf. Great lessons and wonderful external resources."
2,not thorough enough,"Not too bad for a *basic* introduction to security, but certainly not rigorous enough to secure a network. While Sams considers this an ""advanced"" topic (from the cover), the author ""anonymous"" gives only a superficial glossing over of the subject. It's a script kiddie's intro to hacking, in the same vein as Meinel's [poorly constructed] book.What I'd really like to see is a comprehensive discussion on the strategies and methods employed by intruders, with code examples and thorough explanation of common techniques (e.g. buffer overflows, detecting sniffers, common code/scripts to detect SUID changes, etc.). This book merely says ""buffer overflows exist"", when it should describe how to evaluate code to prevent overflow attacks. More forensic topics are required as well, for ""post-mortem"" analysis after a breakin."
2,A book for absolute beginners,"This book won't teach you very much if you're not a newbie to computers and computer security. The author writes over 900 pages, but hardly say anything useful."
3,Entertaining quick read.,"Late 1960s. Advertising executive David Cooper has an affair with model/would-be actress Claudia. Mrs. Linda Cooper lives in denial of her husband's infidelity but, frustrated that he's never at home, has an affair of her own. But it's not long before she'll have to face the truth about her husband's affairs, and before long, David will realize that Claudia isn't as fun outside the bed as in it, and that maybe his wife deserved a bit more respect.""The World is Full of Married Men"" is not great, but it's a fun, quick read (info on Amazon.com says 288 pages, mine was less than 180). It was also made into a movie starring Tony Franciosa and Carroll Baker, today mostly forgotten, unlike its Bonnie Tyler theme song."
5,Breathtakingly beautiful,"A wonderful novel -- for its language, its characters, and its exploration of how life can unfold richly for people on society's margins. I found it truly haunting and can't wait to see what she writes next."
1,"Unbelievably horrible band.. Awful, just awful.","Billy Talent...ugh.A warning to all--if you don't want to wind up begging friends to pound nails through your eardrums, avoid this impossibly $hitty band all that you can. They're going to disappear in a few months anyway, with any luck, but if you do stumble across them, run screaming in the other direction.I know a few label reps, and every once in a while I get handed promo CDs of the next up and comers. I keep even the bad ones usually, but that abysmal Billy Talent CD immediately got sold to a used CD shop. At least the @ssholes who made that piece of crap got me a couple of coffees."
1,The worst band I have ever heard......,"HOLY CRAP DO THESE GUYS SUCK!!!!!!! This CD is the most worthless peice of garbage I have ever laid ears upon!I can't stand the singers voice, he sounds like one of the chipmonks on acid, and twitches and jerks around like a crack addict going through withdrawl. I just get the urge to smack him when I see these talentless posers on MTV EVERY.....FIVE....SECONDS..... JUST MAKE IT STOP!!!!!! The songs are immature and whiny with laughable lyrics. ""The EX""??? ohhhh what a creative idea for a song!!!!!!! Too bad its been done by every other band in this pitiful genre of music the call ""punk"".Sorry, but these guys are just terrible. All you fairies who actually listen to this crap are just as bad. Take my advise and try some Slipknot, Stone Sour, Twiztid, ICP, Korn, Deftones, Murderdolls, Pantera,or Superjoint Ritual for some actual creativity and thought provoking lyrics!!!DustinX10 over and out!"
1,What is wrong with this band and you people?,"AHAHAHAHAHA! Oh my god. This band can't be serious. This band has to be a joke right? I mean come on, is this even music? It sounds like to me a bunch of stupid screaming. I just got done listening to the whole cd and now I'm gonna use it as a fresbee. This band doesn't even deserve a record deal. And I don't care about ""how meaningful the lyrics are."" How about if the lead singer would sing like a normal person, then I'll think about listening to the lyrics. Words of advice: Listen to real rock bands. Not this dumb ""emo"" band that's not really even rock."
1,No wonder punk sucks,"This, like most other punk music, makes me want to puke. The sound is annoying, unoriginal, and the lyrics juvenile. By the way is ""Nothing to Lose"" a cover from some 80's song? It seems really familiar."
4,good stuff from the max,"Here's another review in case you missed the last one. You people should go out and buy this Billy Talent cd because it rules. The breakdowns on this cd are really good and the have an energy that can't be faked. I don't become so numb you wanna know why it's because I don't listen to whiny pansies like linkin park. I like Billy talent better. Sure, Billy Talent might tour with crappy pop punk bands like simple plan and sugarcult but they are a lot better that's for sure. Also, I listen to Billy talent because they have talent and will sing unlike Civil(a crappy little band that will never go anywhere)which has no talent or vocals, AT ALL. This band is better than blink 182, linkin park, simple plan, limp bizkit,the darkness and civil(lol). Because those bands suck and Billy talent doesn't. By the way, my band Vozzro is coming so beware for greatness!!!"
2,Light Book,"The book is not very good If There is not CD.Lacks explanation, examples, etc.It is a kind of mediocre book."
5,Don't miss this deal!,"This espresso machine is fantastic! I bought one a year ago at Tully's and have enjoyed wonderful espresso since then without paying for each indulgence. When I saw them here I ordered another one for myself (in case mine ever breaks) and one for a gift. I've used the machine at least twice a day for nearly a year and it's still going strong. Remember, the grind of your beans is the key... too course and water just zips through and you get colored water, too fine and it takes forever to draw a shot. This is an amazing deal for a pump system, you won't regret it."
3,Good for one...,"This machine is easily operated and makes espresso that tastes as good as any, crema & all. If, however, you plan on making more than one beverage, that is, a beverage that requires the use of the steamer, you will need some time, as you will have to cycle through at least 2 cycles for a single beverage to get it to temp out. But who can complain at this price? Not I, although I am returning mine for replacement/repair due to the fact that it now requires two cycles to steam 8oz of milk, unacceptable at any price. Don't get it if you're playing Barista for more than one."
3,"Good book, but most info copied from his other book.","This is a good book for replication, but allot of the material is covered in his Oracle Built-in Packages book. Almost word for word.The built-in packages book is a much better deal for the money.Mark Greenhalgh Oracle Consultant"
2,Blades got dull after only a few uses,"I was very pleased with these shears at first. However, the performance of the product went downhill fast. After only about three usages on poultry, I discovered that these shears did not cut through chicken skin very well at all. I finally had to get out my 20-year-old Henckles Gourmet kitchen scissors to get the skin cut up. (I wanted it in small pieces to cook in pet food.)I have had great luck with Oxo kitchen knives, so I was quite surprised that these scissors went dull so fast. I guess the difference is that it is easy to keep knives sharpened, but a pair of scissors is an entirely different matter when it comes to sharpening.These scissors still function fine as general kitchen scissors, but I am going to have to get some better quality poultry shears. I feel that these scissors were a waste of money."
4,High Quality,Pros: Easy to clean (easy to take apart and put back togetherVery strongSafety ClaspCons: Would appreciate a second loop in hand-hold for when spring is not enough pressure to reopen scissors.
2,Warranty issue,"Installation was easy, but after four months it started to make a noise. I called the company but they said the warranty was void because a professional did not install it."
3,Are there any other manufactures that make this part?,"This will be the fourth blower motor that I have had to install in the 20 years that I have owned the home. I would expect them to last longer than 5 years on average, but they do not. Have not been able to find another replacement brand."
2,CONDESCENDING,"I found this DVD really LCD, oversimplified, and best for young people or those with zero knowledge of the brain. The book of the same title seems much, much better. I'm working my way through it. Very informative. But skip the DVD."
5,Great for Intro Psych students,"This set of videos is captivating and accurately portrays significant issues in contemporary psychology. The DVDs cover perception, attention and memory--including all the ways our brains can ""fool"" us."
2,"Poor sound, but maybe the price is why.","These headphones do not have a sound that one would expect. While they are very flat in their response, they also have almost no ability to reproduce the lower bass frequencies and even have a dull high-end. Comfort is decent, and the long cord is very handy. If you need a cheap set of monitoring headphones, these might be for you. However they are very odd looking for ""street-wear"" and would disappoint most people who want good quality sound for listening.There just isn't a good set of ""cans"" that have great sound and are cheap. Look at the Sony MDR-V6 and you likely won't be buying another pair again!"
4,Another Creepy Asian Movie,"I love Asian movies, and this one is no exception. We start off with some thugs robbing a store in bunny suits. No one takes them seriously until one fires a shot. Next thing, there are people screaming and running, and the cops show up, and bullets are flying everywhere. The robbers who make it away are too stupid to drive and end up crashing into a building where an innocent young biker is resting. They take him as a hostage and run out back, wondering why the cops aren't chasing them anymore. They board a train, and upon noticing that all the passengers appear to be quite wealthy, decide to rob it. It's not easy to rob ghosts, though ... The leader always shoving his gun into his friends' faces gets annoying, and the gay guy adds comedic relief. One of those B movies that I like enough to add to my collection and brag about."
3,Wrong Color!,The ball I received is not the color of the ball pictured. I ordered this ball because of the color. It was supposed to be a gift. Not pleased! There is no place to specify a color so I assumed it was the color pictured.
5,She is amazing!,"This was the first time I had seen Petula Clark in a concert setting. She was wonderful. She's still got a great voice; a little lower and softer maybe, but nobody does it better. It's obvious that she still loves to sing."
4,Great times with Pet.,"I really enjoyed the overall content of this DVD. Not only does it capture a recent Pet. in concert, but it also features a nice look back at her life and career. With many 'flashbacks' to 60's/70's TV, and 'special' performances with stars such as Andy Williams, Peggy Lee, and the great Dean Martin. It's very good quality, and excellent value for money."
2,"Great idea, poor quality",I bought the Back to Basics 600 smoothie maker about 6 months agos. I was pleased with it until the plastic toggle on the spout broke. It is made of plastic and apparently could not withstand the tension on the plug. I was very disappointed since I use it every morning but thought it would last longer. I will look for a better quality one next time.
1,"Basic design flaw, destined to break","At first I loved this smoothie maker! The basic design is nice, it's conical shape creates a vortex that sucks everything to the bottom. It doesn't do to well with thick shakes, so I was constantly adding liquid to help it mix evenly. It did really well at crushing ice and chunks of frozen fruit.That is, until a chunk of frozen mango got stuck in the blade and caused the gear mechanism to strip. The blades just spun freely. After doing a little research, I have found that many other people have complained about the same thing.I tried to locate backtobasics for warranty replacement, they couldn't be found. Sounds shady to me. Luckily, Target refunded my money, even without the box.My advice is to avoid it!"
3,Pretty Good,"I received this as one of the gifts from my registry. Though I have only used it a few times, it has worked very well for me. I did not have any problems with the lid or with the blades not working. The smoothie elite is a bit noisy but hey...it's a blender...they tend to be noisy no matter what. My nieces and I made strawberry and banana smoothies as well as watermelon slushes. I used the mixer once and other than that, there was no need for it. As far as the drip..yes there was a slight drip that lasted for a couple of seconds after you turn the spout off, but I expected that. There was no constant drip and there wasn't any constant flow. All in all this is a decent smoothie maker for whenever you feel the need to treat yourself. I wouldn't recommend this as something you use every single day. If you like smoothies that much...I suggest investing in a professional quality smoothie maker."
2,Short Life Smoothie Maker,"I've had two of these machines and only used each 8 to 10 times before one or more things broke. They are made almost entirely of plastic, so they really can't handle much. These are the problems I had with one or both of my machines: spout lever snapped off, vibrations of machine cause the bottom to unscrew during blending and spill contents everywhere, bottom propeller and blade stripped, motor died, poor gasket seal.There are two things I like about this machine: the spout that keeps unblended pieces of fruit and ice from going into your cup and instead keeps them near the blade to be reblended, and the stir stick that helps you blend the contents quickly and with fewer blade jams. But bottom line is that this machine simply does not have the power or durability to handle ice and frozen fruits.Maybe it should be called the Malt Maker Elite."
1,Breaks fast!,"Got one of these a couple of months ago, after about 20-25 uses, the part that does the mixing/chopping broke. To be more accurate, the black part on the bottom of the container that is turned to perform it's chopping action striped out the very short machine threads that hold it onto the blades.Forget about parts."
1,Don't waste your money,"I bought one and it lasted less than a month. The soft gear interface doesn't provide a good seat between blender and motor. The result was completely stripped gears. The idea is cute, but they cheaped out on the design. A regular blender works just fine."
3,"Great results, but not well made","When I first heard of a ""Smoothie Maker"", I assumed it was a glorified blender and didn't give in. I love smoothies, though, and finally caved in and bought the Smoothie Elite. The results are much better than what I achieved using my food processor or regular blender. It liquifies the fruit almost instantly. I wish the machine were made better, though. Everything is plastic and has a flimsy feel to it. It is also extremely loud and I had to put a thick rubber mat under it to help buffer the noise. It's a lot to endure, but the end result is great!"
3,Review of Smoothie Machine,"The Back-to-Basics Smoothie Elite Maker makes great smoothies as well as frozen drinks. However, after the second use, we noticed it was difficult to align the pitcher and base properly. Since the pitcher didn't fit securely in the base it caused the rotors to burn resulting in damage to the rotors."
4,Smoothie Maker,"This unit does a fantastic job, and the price is unbeatable. I highly recommend you follow the directions and add the ice & frozen ingredients last. I didn't, and I think that caused the previous unit to wear out. This unit works great, and the spout is very helpful."
3,Some Useful Information But Generally Too High-Level,"This book was useful to me in certain respects: the information contained in it about data center and software development metrics (two chapters' worth) was valuable and timely. The rest of the book, however, was too high-level to be put to immediate use. The author also included far too many visuals. I found them distracting and not supportive of the text."
4,A little dim otherwise works fine,"I bought two of this clock because I'm sick of adjusting the time after a power outage.The clocks sets the time automatically within 5 minutes of powering up. The only weakness is that even with the brightness (dimmer) sets to high, it is still kind of dim, and each LED segment has slightly different brightness. If you put it near the window, I think you may have difficulty reading the clock. However, I put them in shaded areas, so I can read the clock just fine. Still, I wish they can be brighter.You can pick one of the four US time zones (PST, MST, CST, EST) via a switch. I did not test the alarm or battery backup.AC cord has a small power brick attached at the end.Imported from China."
3,not happy,I sent this as a birthday gift to my 6 year old granddaughter. She was so excited to get this! I also sent extra batteries to Mom would not be caught short. Sadly the moon was defective !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Poor QC obviously. It is being sent back for a replacement; we will see the outcome. Followup later.
5,Great learning,"Great for kids. Mine love it its like having the sky in ur room. They love checking the phases every night, and checking when the changes occur. I recommend it for the inquisitive child. Its also a great night light. With a subtle glow. Its mesmerizing to just watch it."
3,My daughter loved this toy however...,"It only wants to work half the time, and we haven't even had it a month yet. I'm going to see if I can get it replaced."
3,Missing a few important things,"WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TOY! Let me explain...Firstly, let me say that this is a really cool ""toy""! It literally looks just like the moon when lit up.HOWEVER - I would pay TWICE the price ($30+) IF it had the following:1. Ability to plug into the wall. The batteries go out FAST!2. Turn OFF the Auto-Off. It turns off after 30 minutes, when gets a screaming and crying 4 year old in our room that the moon turned off.Thankfully my husband is an electrical engineer and can do this for me with a few parts from Radio-Shack, but it's VERY frustrating and needs to be fixed!Therefore, I would not recommend this to anyone unless my husband can get a hold of it first, or they have the know-how to fix it."
4,A great lamp with cool educational value.,Bought this for my 6-yr old boy. Got to talk about the various stages of the moon (waxing and waning crescents and gibbouses). Talked about the moon's position in the solar system and how it orbits the earth and how the light from the sun reflects off the moon based on where it is in position to us on the earth in relation to the sun. A VERY cool toy from that perspective. It's a great toy and works fantastically as a night-light too. The only down-side I give it is that you can slightly see the divisions between the various slices of light sections underneath the surface--but only slightly. A wonderful toy and worth getting. Thumbs up.
5,Grandson enjoys it!,Purchased the Moon for my 3 yr old Grandson. He thinks it is great. A great unique nightlight and we discuss how the moon works! I am considering one for each of the other Grandkids as it is worth the money. A unique gift that lasts a long time. Only suggestion is to keep the remote in a separate place as it is too easy to misplace.
3,Great Accessory in My Kids Room,The Moon In My Room was a great addition to my 6 year old's space themed bedroom. Love that it has a remote so he can change the moon on his own. Great purchase if you want something that is educational and cool for a six year old.
5,Awesome Educational Product,"My 5 Yr old daughter loves this, she told a friend it was a waning crescent moon out, everyone was floored!Every night we look up what moon it is on my iPhone and set her moon.Her only comment is, ""Daddy can you make my moon stay on all night?""So, my only comment is that it would be nice if you could plug it in so you could leave it on all night."
5,Night light,"My toddler likes having a night light that changes shape at her control, and I love that she is learning about moon phases."
5,"I love it, and its so pretty","Its a must have for all the moon lovers, its perfect, u can put it everywhere you want!!!Excellent for change the mood of the room, or for a romantic night ;)"
5,Very nice quality toy,This moon has made our kids space themed bedroom a completed piece. The product quality is very nice and easy enough for our 2 year old to click through the phases. The only concern is what to do if the light inside goes out?
2,Not so whippy...,Purchased as a birthday present for 12 year old female child who is interested in science. Might recommend for a younger child. It was constructed cheaply and appeared flimsy. Not much better than a decent flashlight.
3,"Looks good, but display of light is disappointing","Uncle Milton's Moon In My Room looks great when you have it on something like a quarter display (I can't remember what the phases are called at the moment), or even when it's off (new moon I suppose). But the problem when you get close to a full moon is that you can see vertical lines where the phases are and it looks unnatural. There will be a natural looking sliver, then an overly bright vertical line stretching across most of the middle part of the moon where the first phase is, and so on for the next phase. When it's full, it looks less like the actual moon and just kind of like a weird light."
4,My space kid loves this thing!,"I do wish it had the moon phases listed in or on the box. Reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that I can not get this remote to turn on the moon. The remote will work once I've turned on the moon with the switch, but I can't get the remote to work otherwise. Also, the switch doesn't always work for me either. My husband has no trouble. He flips the switch and every time it works for him, but I am not so fortunate. My son says his father ""has the magic finger"". ahaha! Otherwise, great gift. My 5 year old LOVES it! He goes to sleep with it on every night. I think it's great because the moon stays on for 30 minutes."
3,It's ok,This still hangs in my granddaughter's room. She stopped using it within a day and it just stays there unnoticed now.
5,Great night light!,"This is a great item to add some extra light to my boys room. Does use a lot of batteries, but they love it and I have taugt them the moon phases."
1,Batteries Corroded,"This seems like a fun, educational toy. Too bad it is so poorly made. Batteries don't last long with this toy! Also, the batteries corroded and leaked acid out. Too bad we didn't notice earlier how cheap the circuitry is!"
5,Another Great O'Reilly Book,"I've beed using Samba for the last 2 years and this book helped me finally understand how to properly configure it in 1 night. Very well written and easy to understand. Topics like oplocks and network printer configuration are explained in an easy to read manner. If your using or plan to use Samba, you need this book. Well worth the money."
3,Obsolete and No longer applicable,"This book covers the older SAMBA 2.0 which has a set of solutions for 10-year old Windows NT domain era of obsoleted technologies. There is some small mention of SAMBA 3.0 in the later edition, but it is still 98% SAMBA 2.0 based, which is far too overdocumented.Even if this was SAMBA 3.0, it might not be enough because really the newer SAMBA 3.0.20 has made incredible breakthroughs in interoperability with Windows 2000/2003 ActiveDirectory single-sign-on solutions. Perhaps a newer release of this book or other material will cover the current solutions that are applicable in today's (or tomorrow's) marketplace.So in a sense, this book doesn't really add any value, unless you are a System Administrator for Windows NT 4.0 computers that need interoperability with Linux (or the converse Linux that acquired out-of-market and deprecated Windows NT 4.0, maybe from a flea market, etc.)."
3,Okay,"While it is nice to see Afrika Bambaataa and Soul Sonic Force on stage, the crowd wasn't that interested till late and the sound quality was pretty bad.It shows a large amount of change in hip hop, where they have to spend 5 minutes trying to get girls on the stage to dance, rather than do what they do well, DJ and rap. Only, MAYBE 3 break dancers come on stage...There were a lot of weaknesses in production, the show was fun, however, way too many drops in excitement."
2,Don't expect much in 230 pages,"This book provides an excellent overview of some of the services provided by COM+. Unfortunately, it does not go into enough depth to write applications that take advantages of these services. There are hardly any code examples and many of the explanations assume you already have a solid background on COM and MTS."
3,COM+ doesn't have IMDB and Load Balancing,This book is written nicely. The only problem is that it describes imaginary features that do not exist today like In Memory Database and Load Balancing. Why would anyone buy a book that is not connected to reality?
5,El mejor regalo para mi y para mi bebe,Que sorpresa ! Haber encontrado todas estas canciones en un solo conjunto de CDs. A mis 33 a√±os tengo a mi primer bebe de 2 meses. Y la musica me enternece mas que nunca y me hace recordar los momentos que pasaba con mi abuelita y con mi mama.
5,An excellent choice,"I really enjoyed this book. It covers two dimensional graphics very well. The code will challenge you. I like all books by Jonathan Knudsen. I think he is a good writer. If you a beginner, you might want to buy a primer on JAVA first before buying this book. I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn JAVA Graphics2D"
2,Examples have lots of ugly/nasty inner classes - yuck!,"This book's content is great even though it spends a lot of ink regurgitating the doc (symptomatic of O'Reilly). Even with this it touches on everything within 230 pages while showing many examples.My issue with this book is the way that the examples are written. It uses inner classes left and right requiring more careful reading of the code. I know this is a philosophical issue; but in general inner classes are a lazy programmer's tool which tends to confuse code and make it harder to read/maintain. It is bad enough that they are used in documented public APIs - in a didactic text, there's no need to exacerbate this.Content gets 4 stars. Examples get 1 star. Since code examples are really 1/2 the content, it gets only two stars. Previous book by the author (on cryptography) had much better examples - and didn't use inner classes."
1,Very Disappointing,"I have waited for this book for 11 months.I finally got it two days ago.I was anticipating receiving a book withmany tips and tricks on how to use Archicad.Instead I just got a broad brush history,no good how to's,a limited how firms areusing it, and an incredibly insultingtalk about stories and layers.The whole text of the book could have beencontained in one large magazine article,but the designers of the book choose insteadto double space the sentences and leave alot of white space in the margins.The composition of the pages is fine, butI bought the book for knowledge(which it did not contain),not a pretty page format.Don't waste your time or money.I hope some one else does write agood archicad book.I'll gladly payfor one, but they should have paidme for looking thru this waste of good paper.I have never written a review of any kind ofbook or product before, but this book was sooobaaad that I am writing one now.Jack Rogers AIA"
5,"Clarity, so rare, so prized ...","Humphreys is the only person I know of who can work on nonhuman primates, write philosophy, and edit a literary magazine.The latter shows in this writing: I read this book in a single sitting. You may not agree with the ideas on consciousness (I don't) but you get a clear exposition of all the work from Descartes to McGinn. Also if you want to figure out what Dennett is saying it helps to read this book first."
4,A fun but useful episode!,"This episode was about a friend, so I had to buy it to see what she said. It was a good glimpse into what she used to wear, that's for sure! But the tips and styles you could see carry through to this day, so the lessons were good enough to keep until today."
1,Not for NT,Almost all of the SQL scripts shown require UNIX scripts for execution. Unless you know how to convert the UNIX scripts to NT this book is not very useful.
5,If you buy only one book on supplements,"This is an excellent reference book on nutritional supplements. Far superior to any I have ever read. Page for page, you get relevant, researched information."
1,Now Wait A Minute...,"Give us a break! Dr. Atkins has made a fortune hawking his high-protein diet, which has been a major contributor to yo-yo dieting, bad health and poor eating habits. That he is still promoting those now-defunct ideas should raise a warning flag for anyone seeking good advice and health. There are many better books available on nutrition and nutraceutical supplements."
2,thereader,At first their were problems with the product but the people I bought it from made it right. I recommend them.
2,Cheap plastic ~,"Don't like it, but then look at the cost. Mine wasn't even white. It is blue and I put it in a large bag of dog food. There are markings ever so slight for 1/2 cup and 1 cup which are not of much use - use a measuring cup instead.It's my fault, I should have shopped more carefully to find what I needed, which was a small 1 cup scoop that I could use instead of one of my nice kitchen ones. It's flimsy and has rough edges."
3,"Never could get the ""atomic"" signal","Everything great but could not pick up the atomic signal from Erie, PA. Followed directions exactly 3 times. Even placed it outside. I'm not an idiot. So, it is being used as a regular clock and thermometer and I set the clock manually."
1,Don't Waste your Time or Money,"This is an abysmal display and does an injustice to the Temptations. I find it hard to believe that this is the ONLY Temptations DVD - they were an American ICON. Their music brought down some of the racial barriers that existed in the 1960s and this is the best we could do?Where is the footage of the ORIGINAL Temptations. I agree, until there is something better, you're better off with the Temptations movie. Don't waste your time or money on this poor piece of work that folks are buying solely because there is nothing else. I bought it and I hate that I did."
2,Don't be tempted,"I have to let you know that I was very disapointed with this video. I enjoyed the Temptations movie better. The tempo was too fast, the choreograpy was horrible. Otis must have made up those moves. I didn't expect the songs to song exact but if I would have had my eyes closed I would have had no idea who was singing."
2,There must be better footage available somewhere!,I wish I had not seen what can only be described as a ghost of the Temptations. It is obvious the spark had been extinguished by this time. The guys in the group are acting too vegasy and not concentrating on the music and the moves.It was sad to see Melvin Franklin and Otis Williams trying their best to keep it together like it used to be. Bottom line: don't buy this video if you want to remember the Temps for the supergroup they once were.
2,Caution,"If you think that the Temptations without Paul Williams and Eddie Kendricks ( I don't even dare say David Ruffin who departed so early) is still the mythic group that the World has come to know and love, then go ahead and buy this material. But if you are like me and go by the name or the blurred pictures on the advertisement, you may end up thinking that you are victim of a sad joke. Don't."
1,Not the Real Deal,"If you're looking for the ""REAL"" Temptations--that classic group with the smooth moves from the mid60's this is not the group--the 2 famous lead voices of Ruffin and Kendricks are long gone as is Paul Williams. Even Dennis plods along here and doesn't do Ruffin's songs any justice. However, he can put over his own leads. Melvin is still around and is a saving grace but the group just doesn't cook, it really disappoints. I wanted to see the graceful high steppin' of the past along with the sweet soul rhythms but this wasn't it. Too bad."
5,HAIL TO THE OLD SCHOOL OF MOSHIN THRASH METAL!!!!!!!!!!!! 2 HORNS UP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"if you are into 80's retro thrash metal then this is for you. this is what S.O.D. should sound like today. this thing is sweedens version of ""speak english or die"". the thrash is there and they bring the MOSH!!!! eventhough this is from 1999 once you put it on its 1986 all over again!"
1,Rip Off Aleart!!!!,This doesn't include the $30.00 lab fee. You can buy other kits for the same money that includes the lab fee for free!! Don't buy this item!!!
2,Extra cost,When I ordered this I did not realize I have to pay now and then pay another 30.00 later to find out the results. What I would really like to do is return it for refund.
1,Yet another negative review,"The $30 charge for actually running the test came as a surprise. Another reviewer says that is standard practice with these tests. It is standard practice with tests from this company, but you can--and should--buy test kits from companies that don't have an unexpected extra fee.But let's say that you're ok with that fee. Should you be able to contact the company or communicate in some way? They don't answer calls or emails. We got some pretty crazy numbers as our result. It would have been nice to be able to ask somebody more about this. Now that I've done other tests, I see why they don't want to respond. They might as well have just made up a number out of the blue for as bizarre as their numbers were.This is a take the money and run outfit. Amazon should just take them off their site."
5,Beauty Translates Itself,"I felt moved to add a review of Translations after reading several of the reviews other readers have left. Brian Friel has a feel for language that is nothing short of miraculous. This play in particular is a delicate and wonderful portrait of the universality of human experience. If you care enough to read these reviews you owe it to yourself to read this play. I am a long time admirer of Mr. Friel and I saw a remarkable production of this play in London several years ago. There are times - rare times - when a person leaves a theater and doesn't feel the ground under his feet because of the transport of the experience. That was one such performance, and this is that fine a play."
1,Does not work.,"This trouser press does not work. It does not heat up hot enough to get the wrinkles out of slacks especially those with rayon or polyester material which requires a higher heat setting. Also since only one side is heated, the slacks will have an uneven press on the two pant legs. I have found that if the slacks are not positioned right, you will end up with double creases on the pants which will require ironning to get out."
2,disappointed,Smaller than anticipated as there was no description of size given and thus no way of getting same. Also found that although I set time as close to accuracy as I could ... it would not correct itself even though it was placed on table with another atomic clock (also Skyscan). Returned clock.
3,Cesaria Evora - Club Sodade,"The mighty Cape Verde singer, Cesaria Evora, is treated to a host of remixers, most of whom treat her vocals with great reverence, as they should. Chateau Flight wind up ""Petit Pays"" like a music box, but let the vocals remain front and center; Carl Craig takes ""Angola"" back to Africa (via Detroit) with a minimal and percussion-heavy mix. Afro-house seems to be the order of the day with Kerri Chandler and Osunlade, but Senor Coconut works his glitchy magic on ""Besame Mucho."" Pepe Bradock's two mixes of ""Angola,"" on the other hand, are disappointing and dull dubs; the same holds for Cris Prolific's take on ""Negue."" DJ Rork and Demon Ritchie deliver a dancefloor-serviceable mix of ""Sodade,"" but the real club-stormer is Francois K's take on ""Sangue de Beirona,"" a strong example of how to move Evora's voice onto the main floor, where she belongs."
4,helpful. passed test.,"this is the only network+ book i read to prep for the exam. i did look at some ""brain dump"" style questions. I passed the test on the first try."
5,REFRESHING,THIS TALENTED MUSICIAN RISES TO THE OCCASION. THE MUSIC IS GROOVED AND TIGHT. THE CD IS GREAT DRIVING MUSIC AS WELL AS A PLEASING APITISER FOR THAT SPECIAL DINNER FOR TWO.
4,Law of Contagion,"I enjoy this drama and find the medical situations interesting. The issue of out of control contagious illness has always been a threat, but now people are also developing these agents and it was interesting to see (fictionally) how things could be done to contain them."
3,disapointing,"Bought it for my son when he goes hiking with his friends. He says the useful distance not nearly what they claim. About half to two thirds the distance they can rely on. So it works, just cut the useful reliable distance in only about 1/2 to 2/3 of what is claimed on the package and web site."
2,"It's Treo's fault, not the charger's fault","As other reviewers have noted, this charger won't stay connected. Furthermore, the hot leads are supported by a sub-millimeter-thick plastic base that breaks off at the slightest stress, rendering the thing useless from that point forward. But this isn't the fault of the charger, whether it's a branded or an aftermarket model. This is just an inevitable product limitation that has arisen due to a design fault within the smartphone itself. I see no way around it but to keep buying the cheapest possible replacements for when the inevitable breaks occur. If anyone else has a different solution, please share it."
1,READ THESE REVIEWS BEFORE YOU BUY!,"I didn't and I got burned like everyone else posting here. The Treo 650 power charger is junk, pure and simple. The plug of the charger doesn't fit the phone and always pulls out. It's hard to actually ""charge"" the phone if it can stay plugged in. They should remove this from Amazon -- it's a disgrace that this garbage can be sold."
4,excellent reading,"THIS BOOK IS VERY ENTERTAINING READING.ONE OF THE BEST THINGS ABOUT IT IS THAT IT OFFERS VIEWS OF SOMEONE WITH AN INTEREST IN THE OCCULT THAT IS A TRAINED SCIENTIST.AMONG THE TOPICS COVERED ARE COINCIDENCE/SYNCRONICITIES,ESP,DOPPLEGANGERS,MAGIC,THE SPIRIT WORLD,AND THE MYSTERIES OF THE HUMAN BRAIN.BUY IT,YOU WON'T DISAPPOINT YOURSELF."
1,GPS loses signal and cannot reacquire,"This is one of the worst GPS units I have used. The keys are not intuitive, the battery cover does not fit correctly (how can it be IPX7 water resistant compliant as advertised?), the unit loses GPS lock, when GPS lock is lost it cannot reacquire it.The screens are nice in that you can configure the information, but the unit is not as flexible as say a Magellan Meridian."
1,No signal!,"There is no signal. I got this unit for geocaching. In this ""sport"", you must have precise accuracy. Most of the time the accuracy reading is 40 feet or worse. This unit claims to have accuracy to within 10 feet. Even when there was not a single cloud in the sky and satalites are all around, there was very bad signal. I am probably going to return it for a Garmin."
1,Stacey tries again but flounders.,"Staceys latest installment to her disastorous music career is ""Boomerang"". Maybe she named it this thinking she could turn around her music, but instead....and listen carefully Stacey, boomerangs come right back at ya, and hit you in the face...Just like this CD does. One of my worst experiences in Pop music ever. Songs like ""Tara"" and the title cut show no feeling, and poor producition. Don't even consider buying this mess."
5,Perfect size,Finally I was able to find a scoop this size for refilling dry pet food from large bins to indoor plastic containers. Works great for cat litter too. Most of the scoops until now were the smaller metal 1 cup size so these were bigger (less scooping) and less expensive. Perfect.
3,Sonic Speakers,"This is a good product. Sound quality is good, but durability isn't. Both speakers became detached not long from owning it, but it is a simple fix. The charging port for mine is no longer working, but it was good while it lasted."
5,Great value,"I had 3 of these for almost 2 years. What a great value. Easy to clean, thick anodized alum allows even cooking. Exterior surface can scratch easily but non-stick interior surface is excellent and long lasting if you follow the manufacturer directions for taking care of it."
3,Effective but elusive!,"This is the best product of its type that I have ever purchased. My only problem is with its consistency, which is like half-formed Jello. Hard to handle, but worth the effort. A tad bit expensive, but not prohibitively so. Give it a try!"
1,Paper weight,"First day I got it, it had trouble connecting. Second day, it wouldnt turn on anymore. I dont understand how a company can sell something of such poor quality."
5,A brillantly sad and talented man,"The life of W. Eugene Smith is none the less; inspiring yet depressingly so... A reflection of the truth in life, man and society."
4,good stuff,"This is a very handy measure that includes both metric and english gradation -however, there is nothing below 1/2 cup. The lettering is easy to read and the clear plastic makes for precise measuring. The dimpled sides make it easy to hold. Although it is not an ideal measure for very hot liquids since the heat will transfer from the wall of the container to your hand, the lack of a handle allows it to be stored in a fairly small space. Overall good product."
2,not worth the $,not worth the money - be sure you check out how many sheets are in this before you buy - a whole 4 sheets! what a disappointment
2,Not quite there...,"""I'm not gonna stand in line, oooh I'm not gonna waste my time, I need you right here with me."" Lyrically, singer ""Coopa"" tries his best to write phrases that anyone can relate to, but they seem to end up broad and boring -- in a word: predictable. The musical phrases meander and do not open up to keep the listener interested. There is an overall lack of excitement here. Although, only a local release, this album does not seem to perform on any level."
1,Really?,I didn't like this book at all. Waste of money. The guy dumped her and years later he decides to have her back????
4,Portable Salvation - no it's not Bono - it's U3!,"Have you ever been somewhere that you needed your own computer and software to do some important work? You say that's what you have a laptop for? Sure, but when you can simply plug a memory stick into just about any PC with a USB port and some decent specs - do your work, eject the stick and have off with you! Don't try to tell me that's not easier than lugging even a small laptop. Well, it's Miller time, and you have U3 to thank..."
4,"Love it, but U3 software not entirely bug free.","20 years from now we will all be carrying around something like a Cruzer contains all our personal data, music and documents.The thing is you can do most of it now. With a Cruzer.Got this for $25 + a few bucks shipping from J&R.; WELL worth the price. CompUSA was selling a 1Gb plastic the same day for $25 that I bought a 4Gb Titanium Cruzer for $24 from J&R.; Great deal, good product.My only caveat is that sometimes U3 software is not perfect. Sometimes there is a price to pay for being an 'early adapter', but trust me, a Cruzer or something like a Cruzer will probably be in your life for years to come.If you have questions about U3, please check out their website."
1,Headaches,"I work in IT, and have used many of these from several companies. I used to recommend Sandisk, and we bought over 25 for our office last year. But I've had repeated data corruption problems with the Titanium Cruzer 4G. Saved Word documents were mysteriously corrupt the next time they were accessed. I'm using it on a brand new desktop and a 3 month old laptop, both in perfect condition, and the problem continued after reformatting the stick. I called Sandisk after it occurred a few times and got the typical run around. They finally said they'd replace it, conceding that they'd had some ""bad batches"". That was two weeks ago and I'm still waiting. They've lost a good customer.PS. Other experience: PNY cases break easily from regular use. I've had good luck with Kingston so far."
1,Buyer Beware,"I've owned two of these now--trust me, they aren't well made and you can't count on it working. The software that comes on these is made in France, by a company that doesn't offer support or even have a phone number. I learned this the hard way, after my device froze and then somehow erased my password which resulted in being locked out--with no ability to recover the files or password. Don't buy these things--they aren't built well. If you do, never count on it--always make sure your files are backed up somewhere else. Also, I wouldn't recommend using it for business related purposes. Mine crashed on a way to do a company presentation for a potential client. Sandisk has very poor customer support--you will talk to India and they will offer no help. They even tried to get me to buy a password recovery program to solve the problem--which solved nothing. The software is very flawed. Beware!"
3,Great but DOES NOT come with Avast,"Great USB flash drive, but occasionally i have to plug it into the computer 2 or 3 times to get it to work and it came with McAfee (which sucks compared to Avast) and not Avast like claimedalso took longer than the maximum it should take but im not taking any stars off for that because it has nothing to do with the productTechnical Details (as of 12/11/08)* Retractable USB connector* Rugged Liquidmetal body* Crush force exceeds 2000 pounds* Laser etched graphics and finish* Loaded with the following U3 programs: * CruzerSync synchronization tool * SignupShield password manager * SKYPE ""Make video calls from PC to PC"" * AVAST virus scan"
5,"Outstanding product, would buy again!","- Great capacity- Sturdy construction- USB sliding connector: occasionally slides back into the drive itself when attempting to insert into USB port- U3 security and bundled software: can be handy if you use this in public computers where personal information might be vulnerable- Loading time: I use this at home and at my workplace only, so I disabled the U3 software (it takes an almost unreasonably long time to load the U3 app in order to use the drive)- Accessories: does not come with a key ring or lanyard- Design: reflective metallic exterior, center section blue LED lights up when connected- Summary: Great product. Owned for a month with daily use and experienced no problems. Would definitely buy again."
3,"Product good, software irritaing beyond belief","Product is a neat design, eliminating the need for a cap which would get lost. The U3 software supplied is annoying as hell; I wanted a disk drive, not some companion. The software is Windows only, so if you have a mac it doesn't make much sense, and it's pretty difficult to uninstall the software, and you need to download a removal kit. Hence the 3 star rating"
4,I guess it's hard to sell storage devices.,"When you need storage, you need storage. I think after capacity and overall durability, what sells storage devices is how cool they look. SanDisk's 4GB Cruzer Titanium USB Flash Drive with U3 meets all expectations in capacity and durability. The retractable connector, blue ""in use"" lights, and sleek titanium case did it for me. I initially thought the U3 programs would be helpful, but I ended up deleting them off the drive anyway, since storing documents on it with the software was too complicated, if not impossible. This is not my first flash drive purchase, but it's the first flash drive purchased that I actually use! (It sure as hell beats a floppy disk!)"
4,Great product!!!,"This SanDisk 4 GB Cruzer Titanium USB Flash Drive with U3 is amazing. It's very fast, the U3 software is easy to use, and the password protected feature is very useful, and there are a lot of applications for downloading from the U3 website.I love it!!!"
2,Waste of my time and money!,"I thought when I bought these they were going to be soft and just great. Well I could have got a better set at Walmart for much cheaper and much softer!I washed these once and they are already starting to peel and it makes me think sand is in our bed.Very disappointed in the sheets, would have return upon washing if I knew they would do this!"
1,very disappointed... they packed the wrong size in the queen size labeled bag,"I ordered the Queen size 600 Pistacio. I love the color. After unpacking and washing, per directions, I found that the fitted and flat sheets were too big. I looked on the plastic casing again and it labeled the sheets as Queen size Pistacio. I checked the size on the flat sheet and it said ""CAL KING"". Way too big. I'll try to send them back ."
1,Glass Fogs,"The glass fogs when you put the thermometer in the meat, making it unreadable. Therefore, I am going to try a digital thermometer instead."
4,Grew on me,"I originally considered this book pretty mediocre. The authors put some methods in tables and list others. Also some chapters assume you already know too much about Swing, which was frustrating, and others use classes defined in chapters way back in the book. However, shortly after I started coding with Swing, I found this book an indespensable reference to the Swing libraries that *way* exceeds other books in its coverage. The books may not be for beginners, but I highly recommend it for medium to advanced-level Swing programmers, as its the only one that goes far enough into topics considered ""expert"" to be useful."
4,simple,"It is easy tu use, you just turn it on and begin to speak, there is not much explanation in the manual that explain how to connect the other phones and what other phones can you connect."
1,Junk,"I would not recommend this product under ANY circumstance.They did not work out of the box.Customer Support is poor.Warranty is useless.The wrong phone rings at random when receiving incoming calls. Then another random phone will pick up for voice mail. Works about 80% of the time.My first thought was that it had to be a config error, but it works about 80% of the time. After 5 months we just learned to live with the ""Quirky"" system. Unfortunately the 20% of voice mails that are important seem to be the ones that are misdirected.Now the Voice mail system allows users to leave messages but playback is unrecognizable as speech. When we playback messages we get a series of hums beeps and random tones that are totally unusable.Warranty is still valid but the units must be shipped back to manufacturer.This phone is a Bad Choice"
4,My opinion.,"I am VERY new to woodturning. I received this lathe a few days ago and was very scared at first. The box looked like it had fallen out of the back of the truck and rolled down the street. horrible. The machine itself had one bent leg and one handle was broken clean off. The instructions are horrible and dont explain anything.The machine itself is pretty darn good though. Looks like it would last for quite some time even though its pretty inexpensive. looks well built and once you figure out the set up, it work like a charm. very good for a beginner. despite the busted leg/handle im not even going to go through the hassle off returning it. Just going to get to work! I like this lathe and totally recommend it."
4,"Not sloppy, just fun!","Okay, the previous reviewer is entitled to his opinion, but this is one of my favourite CD's. The whole thing has a loose, relaxed feel, and there are some excellent songs, such as ""Favourite Girl"" and ""The Refuge Tree"".I like Tim Finn's work, and Hothouse Flowers, but I'm mostly an Andy White fan (a rare breed). Maybe Andy's quirkiness takes some getting used to. But I think it's worth the effort. He's brilliant!I've also seen ALT live and I'd rate that as a five-star performance for the great energy and wonderful music. But I'll just give them four stars for this recording. It catches most (but not quite all) of their magic. I'm looking forward to hearing more from them."
2,Not Quite A Mix,"This mix is suppossed to represent the later portions of Roger Sanchez's (legendary) eight hour mixes - presumably the deeper and darker portion of the mix. However, taken out of context it comes of as a huge electro-bore. Not really unlistenable - just not so much danceable. The constant metronomic electro beats, window rattling bass, minimal vocals, and static pacing leave very little left to enjoy in this dance mix. I expect as much from Tom Stephan (DJ of the other mix) who's mixes are sort of always deep, dark and flat. Seriously, no matter what trip I am on at any club - eight hours is quite enough and by this time I am sure my night would be done. Had this mix included at least a few bighter tracks - if only just at the start it would have been much more representational of Rogers sets (albeit, much shorter). I love so much of Roger Sanchez's mixes, in fact all four of his Release Yourself mixes ar some of my favorites, but this one is just not enough."
4,Ambient Excellence,"I must say, I was dissapointed at first when I heard this album. However, I was listening to it at the completely wrong time. This is most excellent when you're needing to chill or are already chilling. Buy this. Now.Now that you've bought this album, listen to Divine Moments of Truth and imagine yourself in a land untouched by european invaders--where lush jungle is broken only by the sound of flutes and gentle drums..."
2,Not very interesting.,"This music is pleasant enough for background listening, but I did not perceive much substance."
5,Jansch Only Gets Better With Age,"Thirty years after his debut, Bert Jansch shows that this Scottish folk singer/guitarist/songwriter only gets better with age. On this collection of mostly originals (""No-One Around"" is the lone exception), Jansch utilizes other musicians with a fiddle here (""Step Back"") or a saxophone there (""Summer Heat""), but each song showcases Jansch's own warm vocals and understated guitar work, especially lovely is the instrumental ""The Lady Doctor from Ashington."" Not only is this Jansch's best album of the Nineties, it's quite simply one of the best albums of his career. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED"
5,Do yourself a favor and buy all the Goats you can!,"Out in the Open has been one of my favorite albums of all time ever since I came across it while passing through Westport Ireland in 1999 and bought it on a whim. Their driving sound and poignant lyrics are felt deep down inside rather than just listened to. It was played nearly non-stop the rest of the trip while driving the narrow twisting back roads of the emerald isle.The other Goats discs and anything by Pat Gallagher, their lead singer, are all good but Out in the Open will be very tough to match indeed."
2,Kind of a disappointment,"I was really kind of disappointed in this book. I was a little leary of the title because I tried to crack Flash on my own and it didn't seem like program you could master that quickly. So many good reviews on this book, I thought it would have to be pretty good and comprehensive. This book doesn't cover the subject with the depth you'd expect since its so thick. I bought the Visualy Quick Start Flash and the Flash Bible at the same time. The 24 hour book I returned. It didn't measure up to either of the other two books both f which I would highly recommend."
3,Maybe a little more than 24 hours!,"The author covers a lot of ground, but I got the feeling he was dragging me over all of it. While I did learn basic Flash, I found that the text was frequently imprecise and the screenshots were so small that they were difficult to see. I spent much more than an hour on many of the chapters, and still felt uncertain about the concepts.Given the cost of the book, a small miracle in the world of overpriced computer books, it was probably worth the money. I note that the other reviews have been strongly positive, but I just can't agree with all their findings and praise. There is no clear conceptual framework in which to place the many exercises."
2,so you like vocal trance?,"A state of trance 2007 has a lot more vocals than past years. If that is not your thing, then I would pass.This years mix is also a bit softer than past years and I find myself listening to the 2005-2006 albums far more often. There really aren't any memorable tracks that I want to listen to again and again."
3,"""OK""","I think 2005 was the best ASOT. 2006 isn't bad either. 2007 is just ""ok."" It starts out strong, but then begins to degrade towards the middle and end."
2,absolute beginner!,"I bought this book because of the glorious praise it received on this website, as well as on others. I am definitely an ABSOLUTE beginner, and found the first four chapters extremely easy to read and informative. I was very much looking forward to Chapter 5 and beginning to program. The book DOES NOT provide a CDROM with the necessary programs, and if you are an absolute beginner like me, you probably have no idea where you can get these programs (except to purchase them all). I'm still bewildered. If the programs were available I would give a much higher star rating."
1,No Ink,"I'm really surprised by all the good reviews for this stamp pad. There is barely any ink in it. Using all my weight, as an adult, I can get a little ink on the stamp and you can barely see an image. A child using this, won't get anything on the stamp. Not worth the money."
1,Melissa & Doug stamp pad,Purchased this as a replacement for 2 stamp pads that came with 2 separate Melissa & Doug stamp sets. The stamp pads that came with both sets were dry. This one too arrived and was pretty dry. Some colors worked some and some did not. Would not recommend nor buy another Melissa & Doug stamp pad.
1,No Ink!,"I opened it, hoping to use my new stamps with it when I am grading papers, and none of the ink shows up on the papers! it's the worst one I have ever seen. I thought maybe it was just that color so I tried some of the other colors, but nope, it's all of them. I don't recommend this pad at all."
4,Such wonderful color,"Just opening the package and seeing this product on the top of the other items I ordered, I knew it would be a fun thing to have in the house for when young children visit. I know they will have hours of entertainment using stamps to create fun things!"
3,is going to be a christmas gife,We purchased this and the other products for a grand daughter whom is into scrapbooking.Gary
4,Stamping fun,"I bought this for my 2.5 year old daughter, as she loved playing with stamps at day care. The colors were bright, and best of all, they did wash off when she stamped on her shirt! However, I agree with the other reviewers that the colors tend to run together a bit, but that didn't seem to distract my daughter."
1,came dry,colors look great but it doesn't have any ink! I wanted to give it a try because it is cheap but don't waste your money!
1,Poor Quality,I purchased this pad along with two different stamp sets. The ink is almost dry and the lighter colors barely show at all.My son was really disaponted when the stamps don't show. This product is not worth your money.
2,Dried out when recieved,"Was very disappointed to get this and find out that all of the ink was very dried out. A few of the colors did work, but were still not of the best quality."
1,Worst stamp pad ever,"I'm not sure why I got suckered into buying another Melissa and Doug art product since the children's watercolors were such garbage, but I guess I thought it would be hard to screw up a stamp pad. I was wrong. The colors are incredibly weak (which incidentally is the same problem I had with their watercolors) and don't show up when stamped. If the kids (aged 8, 6, and 4) pushed HARD they would show up faintly, but otherwise we might as well have been using invisible ink! I love the wooden toys by this same brand but I will never buy more art products from them. We are all very disappointed with this product."
3,"Great colors, quality ok","My daughter loved the colors on this pad, but the quality was not great. We tried to do finger stamping and it did not come great. I ordered this with Ed Embereley's Funprint Drawing Book, but the color pad does not do the trick. When we print the fingers, the colors are dotted. i guess they need to add more ink to the pads or the quality of the pad or ink is not so good.For regular stamps, it worked great, but would not recommend it for finger stamping."
5,So glad this ink really is washable!,"My 3.5-year-old and her little friend thought it would be fun to ink the bottoms of their feet and go stomping all over the house. I nearly had a heart attack when I saw the little rainbow-hued footprints on the carpet, but the ink came right off with just a damp cloth. I was pretty impressed. I did get to it within maybe 15 minutes, but still... amazing. Great product for kids."
2,Don 't fit in my ear canals,"In a nut shell, the ear phones did not fit comfortably in my ear canals. I could never be sure I was getting all the bass response they were supposed to deliver. I'm sure they will be great if they will fit in your ear canals. I would suggest buying them from Amazon because you can return them without hassel if they don't fit."
1,Mucho ruido y pocas nueces,"Escritura deplorable y un af√°n de escandalizar con recursos que, por reiterativos, se agotan a las pocas p√°ginas. Un excelente ejemplo de c√≥mo se puede convertir en novelista a un escritor de escaso vuelo, gracias a una buena labor de mercadeo y al abordaje de temas pol√≠ticos oportunos."
4,Laughs on the wing,"Alaska Sky Follies has the making of an Alaskan aviation classic. A series of great stories that will keep you chuckling on those long winter nights and jiggling the coffee in your cup. Well written and fast moving, it belongs on the shelf of all those interested in flying or Alaska.I also highly recommend, Flying North South East and West, a great read on a young couples struggles to start their life in Alaska. The book is filled with aviation that starts in the north, and progresses to the sands of Africa. It also covers a ignored segment of aviation history, Cargo Flying. Strap in and come along on a expedition to the North Pole in a bush plane, then cargo flying four engine jets to Africa, and bush flying 737's on slick runways in the north country. Another great read.Flying North South East and West: Arctic to the Sahara"
1,"Gee, Awfully one way","OK. Call me a moron. But I bought this book... assuming it translated Portuguese and English back and forth- who would only want to translate portuguese into english?... you mean for $80, I only get a one way trip.This book is excellent for a university book translator living in the US or Britain. For a field businessman or engineer looking to become a colloquial speaker and writer.... look elsewhere.Stanford University press... you cheap turkeys... didn't Leland Stanford, your robber baron railroad founder, leave you enough land and resources to include things going from English to Portuguese... Well you have my $80, and now I know how Leland made his money."
5,Highly Recommended,"After reading all six of the Jungle Novels, I've been trying to decide which novel was meant to be read first, Government or The Carreta. Looking at the publishing history, I saw that in Germany, Great Britain and the U.S. Traven had always published The Carreta first. But despite that I really think that Government is the best of the series to read first, because it best describes the system of debt slavery in Mexico that is the setting for what follows in the other novels.That's not to say that the novel is boring. Quite the opposite. It's a fascinating page-turner, as are all the novels in this series. In fact, this is the strangest and most unexpected series of novels I have ever read, and when I put down the final volume I couldn't help but compare it favorably to Alexander Dumas. The style is very different, but the story is that good, and that well told.But I won't bore you with my opinion. It's best to let the books speak for themselves. Highly recommended."
2,Really interesting jazz disc mastered like a rock record,"This disc is mastered hot, which means there are tons of clipping and lots of compression. The more dancey parts sound really poor. I hate when a supposed jazz cd is mastered like a rock record. I would avoid this one if you have decent gear and listen closely to music. :(It's unfortunate as the music is quite interesting and worth listening to."
4,mostly satisfied,The skillet is a great size for scrambling eggs for 1-2 people. My only complaint is the screw caps for the handle are on the inside of the skillet. The clean up around the screw caps is more involved than the nonstick surface. I would still recommend it as a great buy.
5,Government Deceit and Duplicity,"Trail is another excellent case study of the unlimited arrogance, deceit, and duplicity in Washington D.C. Its value is reflected in the price of used copies... and the efforts to kill public interest in the book. The hardest message to communicate is the extent of arrogance, deceit, and duplicity in our own government because we have been taught from an early age of how wonderful our elected leaders are. Well, the truth is out there, but you have to search to find it. Trail of the Octopus is an excellent example. Another very good book is the Boys on the Tracks. There is no end of good examples in the efforts to get the truth out respecting the government's abandonment of missing American POWs from the top on down. See Betrayed by Douglass, which has a listing of 25 plus other books and videos on this subject, all with a consistent message respecting the absence of honor and principles at the highest levels in our government."
2,Not an authentic south indian cookbook!!!,"A huge disappointment!! If you are a Madrasi/looking for authentic or serious Madrasi - tasting dishes, forget it!! This will be O.K for somebody wanting to imitate Madrasi/south indian cooking or for a brand new beginner. Most of the recipes call for couple of basic spices (eg. chilli pd.,turmeric pd.,ginger-garlic)...That's it! But, the names given to these recipes are madrasi-sounding definitely.Any way what kind of cookbook author would call a curry leaf- neem leaf!! I am pretty sure it was not a printing error."
1,"Faulty product, don't buy it!!",Check out the below (cut and past into your browser address) - all of these panasonic phones have problems. This is about a pending class action lawsuit against Panasonic.http://www.sheller.com/Practice.asp?PracticeID=140
1,Poor sound quality - interference from other electronics,"Interference from other electronics is a severe problem - I had to return this item for a refund. If you can locate it several feet from any other electronics, it might work for you, but who wants a phone that you cannot place on your desktop, near a computer?"
3,Nice concept but for a select audience,"If I could have looked inside this book before I ordered it, I probably wouldn't have bought it. While many of the houses are interesting, the style of most of them is 'European modern' or even experimental (that's not meant as a criticism in itself). In the author's introduction the sub-heading is ""...producing small architectural objects..."" -- that's a good description, the houses are more architectural objects than anything else. So, if you're interested in modern trends in residential architecture, this is a great book; if you interested in modest, economical homes of a more traditional nature, this definitely isn't the book for you."
4,Smaller is Better,"A great book that flys in the face of the American ""bigger-is-better"" model. This is a fascinating book on the creative use of small space - where often less is more. For those of us who yearn for more intimate and affordable spaces this will give you lots of good ideas and inspiration for using any small plot of land or city building lot. I read this book after reading ""Prefab"" - both books go together well."
2,Strangely inaccurate,"I would agree with most reviewers that this book gives good food for thought in the ""less is more"" aesthetic that is so lacking in modern America; however, it is very puzzling that the Mt. Fuji house is listed at elevation 15,064 ft, when the mountain itself is only 12,388. Ditto for the Wenger House, which is listed as sited at an impossible 21,520 ft elevation in the Swiss Alps (22,500 ft being commonly known as the oxygen deprivation ""death zone"" for Everest). Sloppy editing and copy detract from the book's basic good ideas."
5,Do not miss it!,This album is soooooooooo cool. Particularly track 2 that I keep listening again and again. the CD is in my car and keep me company on the road
5,gr8 one here...,"If you really need that ""stuff"" to bring you back to reality sometimes, then you better pick this one up. Big City Life tells it all! Other special fav are:6. Clear & Present Danger7. Older11. 11.30Songs on this album are just too fantastic that I can stop playing it over and over again....thnx Mattafix for a wonderful album...Much appreciated!one"
4,Too easy for 2-year-olds,"This video, like most Baby Einstein products, is excellent, but was too basic for my 2-year-old granddaughter; she totally ignored it.I wish the videos were clearly labeled with the age of their intended audiences."
4,Pretty Good,"There is a lot of hype about the baby einstein products and I absolutely love the books and cd's but the dvd's are just okay. My daughter does watch them but they are not the ones that she requests. However I really do like the concert hall on this one, but i could have just saved [money] and bought the cd for the same effect. Still not a bad buy though."
4,A Former Student Looks Back,"I had the priviledge to study with Frank X. Walker when I was a student at Ky Governor's School for the Arts. At the time, I knew nothing about black history--so shamefully little that I didn't even know what Malcolm X looked like. Frank introduced me to the richness of black culture and showed me what I was missing. He is a man of great power; that power forces bare words into tremendous fluidity of motion. His bare bones personality comes across in his writing and the heartfeltness behind his poetry, while expressing the emotions of an African American, transcends cultural barriers so that even I, the whitest white girl alive, can begin to understand."
4,a bit big but nice product.,"I like it--it's cute & practical but it is a bit big for my T-Mobile Dash and it slides out. I'm using it for my camera, which works nicely."
4,Very Nice,As with any furniture that you have to assemble the ease of the directions makes all the difference. The instructions were easy to follow and everything was included. It was not hard or overly time consuming to assemble. The wood finish is excellent and matches all other pieces we purchased. This is Highly Recommended.
4,Quality product,"the quality of the entire package was much better than I expected. It contains a complete serving set, from dishes to silverware, as well as wine goblets. All of which were well made & arrived completely intact - much better than a previous attempt with another company"
4,"Clear, straigthforward explanations for a beginner","Concise descriptions of what happens inside the scripts. The author adresses JS matters without assuming previous knowledge on this subject, but he clearly makes you progress by invoking some math background (i.e. to explain functions ) and also involving the reader in logical deductions to make you think. Some hints of humour and lightweight prose are present along the book, without leaning too much towards the ""for dummies"" series. As an absolute beginner, it's more than enough."
4,Reflections on the Memoir,"The 1987 edition of Inventing the Truth originated in the winter of 1986 as a series of talks sponsored by the Book-of-the-Month Club at the New York Public Library. A shadow of its predecessor, Extraordinary Lives (1986), this slender book has as its theme, reminiscences about writing memoirs. Although novelist Toni Morrison and medical writer Lewis Thomas veer off to a degree from this theme, all the essays are valuable as examples of good writing. There is no index, but the volume concludes with fascinating annotated bibliographies of the authors' favorite first-person narratives."
2,Perfect for the first-time track patron,"This book is pretty basic. The first 23 of the 32 pages are devoted to very basic material such as reading the program, the tote board, types of bets, and how to place them.If you are going to the track for the first time with a group, and you want to bone up on the sport real-quick, this is the perfect book for you.If you are a serious handicapper looking for an innovative theory or deep discussion on overlays and handicapping, this is not that book."
5,Very good book!,My father-in-law just moved to Daytona Beach and started going to the racetrack but knew nothing about it! I bought him this book and he became an expert in a few days! Very informative book!
2,Pretty isn't everything!,"This journal is beautiful, and it's a great size. However, the binding is terrible and it's completely falling apart after only a few months. Since I keep my journals and cherish them, this creates a big problem. I don't know if I want to risk buying another Flavia journal, which is too bad because they are very pretty. However, I need more than looks in a journal!"
5,zoids ...[cool],"hi im joey im 11 im on sending but i watch zoids every day at 4:30 and in the morning has ne body seen the new edition with the dude who looks like vega my fav. people are bit cloud and the liger-0 i love the transformation parts ,the only thing is is the new edition class-s ive never seen class -s they always restarted it after the royal cup thing"
4,Lightweight fun,"Essentially the ""Toonami"" version of the show, the DVD containsthe first four episodes of the series as aired on TV--no extrafootage, languages, or extended opening/closing credits. On apositive note, the series' excellent mixture of CG andtraditional animation shines through on the DVD release."
4,Excellent resource for World War I information and terms,"As a reader of World War I fiction and memoirs, I found this an invaluable resource for unfamiliar terms, such as different types of weapons/equipment. This dictionary, compiled by an authority on military history and munitions, covers important people, the battles, and terms of WWI in concise, understandable terms. In additon to the 650 entries, some drawings and maps were included. While students of history may not find this book detailed enough to meet their needs, I found it a useful pocket resource."
2,too time consuming,I like the portable part but it takes ridiculously long for the wax to heat up and it cools down pretty fast too. Dont buy this if you dont want to waste hours when you could get the sae job done in 15 minutes with another product. Definitely not worth the money.
3,"Eh, it's alright","I'm pretty ambivalent on this one. I've seen MUCH better baby videos, but I've also seen MUCH worse! I'd never seen a baby einstein video before I got this one, so I was expecting something a little different. This is pretty much just music playing in the background while showing various toys/objects. Not too interesting for ME, but my son likes it - for short amounts of time. All in all, there are other videos I'd like to watch more, but I'll turn it on if I need a few minutes to myself."
1,A total let down,"I bought the DVD after reading reviews about it. My 22 month old hates the DVD and did not watch even 10 minutes of it. The hand held puppets put him off and scared him, especially when they stuck out their tongues and wiggled about. My toddler calls the handheld toys piggy' and if I ask him if he wants to watch the Piggy DVD, its a emphatic NO.They should have used better animations. I bought Baby Van Gogh and Mozart and we have not watched either of them fully. A total waste of money. Check out the DVD's before you buy, its not for everyone."
3,A necesssary evil,"Bought this although I know I'm not supposed to show my 10 month old TV (TV isn't recommended for children under 2). He has to use a nebuliser a few times a day. This is a good distraction for him/keeps him still. Outside of his treatments, I'm not comfortable with his watching the tape because I'd rather he learn to play with his toys himself or with me rather than watch some personless hands play with them on tv. He really likes the tape (reaches for the images and ""talks"" to the tv). I don't see how this program helps his development. It does help me give him his medicine, however. I can see the temptation for an at home parent who is trying to get work done to use this because it is so mesmerizing. We're going to discipline ourselves to make this the baby's special treat."
3,My baby doesn't like it,"I bought two Baby Einstein DVDs for my 8-months old. She doesn't care either of them. It is as if the TV is not on. To be fair, the video is producted with babies in mind, the vivid colors, simple shapes and objects should be ""educational"", if only I can get her to watch!"
3,AutoCad 2004,"This is a pretty good reference book for anyone just starting out with AutoCad. It is not all incompassing, there have been a couple of topics that I was looking for that are not presented here. But, this book in hand and experimenting with the software, I've managed to solve all most all of my questions/problems with trying to draw a particular part or assembly."
3,Stop the sterotyping!,"The plague year was an ok book. It had a good plot, and some of the characters were realalistic but than others were BIG stereotypes. The jock and the cheerleader were a big joke. High school isn't all about your pom-poms or footbfall jersy, but the other characters were realistic the outcast, the wanna be, the compasionate ""geek"". Every person could realate to them in some way. Your heart went out to them but then for the sterotypes, she made them hated, she forced the hatred on you she didn't give you a chance to figure out if you like them or not.She almost made you not like them. She needed to let you figure it out yourself. The book had a good theme and it mad you think about others and there feeling and how someone can affect the way they feel about themselves. You should read this book if you like stories that make you feel for someone."
3,Not Worth Reading,"The Plague Year by Stephanie Tolan is one of those every day stories about people being picked on for the way they look. Its all about a new boy at school and he looks different than every one else. But behind the way he looks, he has secret. This secret is to never be known by anyone. And when if it gets out, it could ruin his life forever. A young boy by the name of Bran starts school in a new city, soon to find out the people in ridgewood are not going to like him....at all. Bran is a ""still"" charactor and does not like to talk to anyone, untill he meets a girl named Molly who will befreind him. Stephanie tries to get the theme across that you should try to be an individual, but in my opinion she is almost telling you to be like every one else so you dont get picked on. I did not like this book to the least bit. It started to be goodstory but she Stephanie got her emotions to the story all mixed up."
2,Over rated,"I believe the description of the cd was very good. However, when I received it, the cover was cracked and the CD was scratched causing it to skip in one area. It should have been rated fair."
2,"broken welds, no warranty","I do not recommend this mini stepper.First of all, even if you set the resistance to the hardest setting, it's way too easy. It's hard to get a workout.Second, it broke after 8 months of light to moderate use."
4,Great product,"These work just as well as your average bleached paper towels as far as absorption and durability goes. I have used the unbleached version of these paper towels and found them to be far to stiff and not very absorbent. One gripe is that to tear off a square you have to be careful or you end up with an uneven piece, not a big deal but kind of annoying."
2,do the math,"You might be comparing these white paper towels with the 30 rolls of Seventh Generation, brown paper towels also sold on Amazon wondering which is cheaper. Note that these are 70 sheets per roll. The brown ones are 120 sheets per roll.White paper towels$40.99/(30*70) = 1.9 cents per sheet.Brown paper towels$54.99/(30*120) = 1.5 cents per sheet.So the brown ones are cheaper.(Prices updated on 11/13/07)"
2,Disappointment based on positive reviews,"I own the brown version of these paper towels and only use them to cover food in the microwave as they are not useful for anything else. I delayed buying the white ones for that reason. Then I read all the positive reviews that it was close to Bounty (brand I use and love) and much stronger than the brown.I can assure you this item is NOT even close to Bounty, but is moderately better than the brown version. After it is wet, it starts to decompose but not as readily as the brown version. After I use up this case, I will not purchase either the brown or white again. I do happily use this brand's toilet paper (except when guests come) and I love their lavender scented dish washing soap and laundry products."
5,Amazingly absorbant recycled Papertowels,"Beind a Viva lover, I was skeptical of the quality a recycled paper towel would provide, but Seventh Generation has their s--t together because they make great paper towels and even better toilet paper! When you buy it in bulk from Amazon.com it costs about the same as regular brands and really makes a dent in the use of natural resources. Thanks Amazon for making it easy to do the right thing!"
4,WAY over-priced here,"Excellent TP, but Amazon is off their rocker at this price. My wife just got back from Central Market where she bought 12 rolls for 8 USD. You do the math. I'm surprised at these prices. If they were more reasonable, this would be 5 stars without question."
2,Great for the Environment???,"Papertowls are not good for the environment.. Even if they are recycled. Use a regular reusable towel. Purchasing them online only makes it worse. The packaging and shipping more than destroys any benefit the environment gets by buying this ""green product""."
4,"The way things worked, and the way people were","A well-written and highly credible first-hand account of a fascinating era of technological and social change on one of America's last frontiers, by a man with the analytical mind of an engineer leavened by lively human interest. I find this book as enjoyable as it is useful for historical research."
2,Too Vague,"I bought this book, spent an hour or two looking it over, and realized that I don't have the time to try and figure out how to apply what the author is trying to explain. I needed a true quick start book, with solid examples of applications. I brought it back and exchanged it for ""Fireworks, Fast & Easy Web Development"" by Lisa Lee. A much better book for someone who doesn't have a whole lot of time on their hands. It has solid examples of how to do things like create buttons, optimize images, etc., just what I needed."
1,Not to good,"I bought this book based on the fact that it was cheap, however, I was appointed by the basic approach of the book - that it was a reference book and nothing more"
1,Poor Quality,"This camera has fried 2 SD cards so far, the camera is only $20 but since the SD cards were both $50, I should have used the money to get a better camera. Picture quality is very poor, and the buttons are too small for a child to use."
2,"Oversized, overpriced, overdone","First, before getting to the story line. I found the new format for this paperback very uncomfortable to hold and read, the extra weight hurt my hands after 3 chapters. As for the price? I really think that this type of format was created to increase the book prices. Was double spacing and extra weight of book worth it? NO!As for the story line, I have enjoyed the Dark books, but have found the the whole ""You are the light to my Dark"" thing getting a bit boring; especially when it's repeated more than several times through out the book. How many times does the man have to say it? It seems in some of Ms Feehan's books that it said almost every chapter! ENOUGH ALREADY!I would like to see what happens to the Carpathian race, but will wait for book to show up in my local library."
4,the perfect first mate,"I have been boating for many years and after reading The Perfect First Mate by Joy Smith, it has made life much easier. Now my husband and I can enjoy cruising as well as boating with Joy's tips, especially on keeping and storing food items. It takes many years to learn what she has to offer and I thank her for it!"
1,Terrible,I have read a few of Schiffman's books. I have attended a few seminars and I have met with him twice. Every time I come away unimpressed. There is no doubt that he is a good salesman but he is not capable of relating his skills to others. This book is no exception. I believe this book to be a bit simplistic and overall a yawner. It misses the boat for captivity.
5,Steve is the MASTER!,"Stephan Schiffman has hit a home run with his latest book, ""25 Toughest Sales Objections!"" As an experienced Sales Trainer I know of no one better than Steve to discuss and create such a great compilation. Steve goes into a couple of my favorite objections: ""I Need to Think About IT"" and, ""We're Happy with our Current Vendor."" This book is for both new sales people and Sales Professionals!"
3,Just ok,"I just finished reading this book and really there was good information. While I did like the authors directness, sometimes it felt a little over the top. The writing was a little elementary which actually didn't bother me too much and I can see how many in sales may actually appreciate this writing style. Some of the things in this book really got me fired up to get out and make some sales. I wish I could have given this book a 3.5 star review, but couldn't give it a 4. All in all I would say it was worth the read, but I have read better."
2,Lacks Depth or Power!,"Look, in all honesty this little book was a light and easy read; it made some good suggestions on what habits (or actions) a salesperson should make to become more successful... however, it's brevity translated to simplicity and lacked depth or power. Sure, I might suggest it to a person absolutely new to sales or just wanting a primer or quick read... beyond that, look elsewhere."
3,Not a bad little book,This book wasn't bad. It took an evening to read and had some good advice. Not a lot of new information though. If you need a cheap sales pick-me-up I'd recommend it.
1,Fiction,"This book is one I can't buy and read. It already spews fiction about ""terrorists"" and 911. Read something true before fiction."
2,Mine broke too!!!,"I used this dough blender for not even 6 months, and the handle snapped! (mind you, I am not a pastry chef, so I was not using it everyday. I used it a handful of times.) I understand it has a 5 year warrenty, so i will try to get it replaced. I have to say that it worked great before it broke."
4,Pops Apart,"The metal part is attached to plastic end-pieces that then pop into either side of the plastic handle. After a couple uses, the plastic pieces started popping out of the handle. The blender still works great, and the metal is sturdy enough that you can still use it though the end-pieces won't stay in the handle. My solution has been to keep a thumb pressed on the end-piece so at least one side stays in the handle as I am blending."
3,an introduction,"just as the title,this is a intrduction of the linear algebra.it not a hard book, very detailed .only i don't like the smybol they used in here1"
1,Missing Pages,"I started using this book as it was the assigned for a course. However, it's mid-semester, and I realized my book is missing pages! I'm pretty sure it's a binding issue....I'm very disappointed, and it's a huge annoyance to pay for a textbook that is missing pages. I wanted to study for an upcoming an exam, but will have to borrow a friend's book in the meantime. Do not buy this book, get the hard-copy book if possible."
1,Still waiting althought it was bought over two months ago,"I bought this item with the actual lathe itself. The lathe showed up, the cutters showed up, but the extension still hasn't. I am quite agitated at the whole ordeal."
4,Just the right mix.,"This is a very well conceived and executed documentary which will keep your interest. It has a good mix of historical re-creation drama and, just as you might become a bit bored with wandering thoughts, it brings in a completely relevant bit which demonstrates the point being made...to wit, the portion about how the HIV virus can mutate in the manner of evolution. Good acting, good cinematography, with certain location shots. All in all a true 4-star production, in my highly-evolved yet humble opinion!"
5,Awesome,"My grandmother bought this for her house for the great-grandkids. My 7 year old played with it, my 2 year old played with it, and they swung on it together. Very sturdy, the kids didn't have a problem staying on, not flimsy whatsoever. I'm buying my own right now!"
1,not truly dishwasher safe,"I've had this cookware for about 4 years. It is not truly dishwasher safe. Over time the exterior has become quite dull and ugly. It seems to have faded in an inconsistent way. Even though this cookware has a ""lifetime"" warrantee, Anolon will not replace the cookware if it becomes damaged from being cleaned in the dishwasher."
3,Not a true non-stick,"This pan, does work nicely-yet cleans up horribly. It doesnt have a quick release on the food you are stir-frying or searing. I would have spent the $$ on a nice straight up anodized pan."
3,Not as good as I had hoped,"I bought these recently because I was looking for good, durable, comfortable shoes for work in some color other than black or brown. Unfortunately, I do not find them to be as comfortable as I had hoped. There isn't nearly the amount of padding I expected, the upper is stiff and rubs the back of my ankle and overall it just feels like it's cutting in to my foot in odd places.I'm hoping they will break in a little and be better... but if I had it to do over again, I would go back to my Eastlands."
3,"A decent read, but not as good as Anderson's previous works.","I found Cherish to be a bit slower than the author's other books, and a bit more violent. There was always an impending sense of doom. Nevertheless, I fell in love with Race, who was a hero with sharp edges. He shows Rebecca patience when she needs it, and seems to know when to push her when she appears to be falling apart. I especially liked the love scene between them. I almost laughed out loud when the heroine talks about Keats and Race's ""manly business."""
3,"Well-written, But...","This book is very well-written, believe me. The trademark Catherine Anderson stamp is there. However, reading this book is NOT an easy chore.The book opens with a brutal murder-rape scene with the heroine witnessing the massacre of her parents and friends. The hero rescues her after a long, bloody shootout with the outlaws, and the book never stops in its unremitting feel of danger. Every quiet moment the two share seems to be on borrowed time, as the outlaws continue to haunt them. A 12 year old got senselessly murdered, people got beaten up badly, and when I reach the end, it's with a sense of relief, not satisfaction.Catherine Anderson writes well about the healing powers of love, but for me, this book is really dark and morbid. I'll pass."
2,Painfully slow,"I LOVED ""Annie's Song"" and ""Simply Love"" but this one didn't grab me as much. I hate reading a couple hundred pages before something signigificant happens between the two main characters. The love was there, it just took forever to be realized. I'm starting to see the ""formula"" behind Anderson's books, and it's getting old."
2,Incredibly depressing read,"This book is a real downer, and the heroine is a dependent weakling. Anderson is a talented writer who just needs a different plot."
2,A Journey I Wish I Hadn't Taken,"A ""Symphonic Novel""? Perhaps, if the symphony had been composed by PDQ Bach. About the only thing I'll remember about this book is its title. It is inconsistent in the quality of its prose. At times, it is almost poetic and spellbinding. At other times, however, it's very tedious and somewhat pompous and lecturing in its tone. A little more editing could have eliminated about 200 pages of unnecessary detail and dialogue.Usually, when I finish a book, I like to sit and savor the experience. When I got to the end of this tome, I breathed a sign of relief that it was over. Oh well, that's about 10 hours of my life I'll never get back."
1,facts be damned,I was somewhat enjoying this book until errors started appearing as to background facts in the story. Who was the editor? After that I could not continue in the face of such laxity. If the author is trying to create a world of his own at the least get the scenario right.
1,DOes not adapt,"I tried to use this unit with three different telephones and 2 different receivers--no combination worked. A VERY useless device. Maybe it works only with its own companion receiver, but if so, the description should state so. Bottom line, don't waste your time or money!"
2,Boneman offers atmosphere with little else,"Boneman starts off promisingly, with a drug dealer getting snuffed by a zombie dealer intruding on his turf. Then things start a gradual decline. Few of the characters seem realistic and, to make matters worse, the sole female character and her family troubles is so underdeveloped it feels ignored. I found myself getting angry at the author, why couldn't she get more in depth? Still there are isolated moments of creepiness, just not enough to support a full length novel, perhaps a short story."
1,Amateurs shouldn't write books on Algorithms,Andrew Binstock was never a practicing computer professional. During the time this book was written he was a magazine editor. Someday I look forward to Donald Knuth's great tome on the Art of Magazine Editing. Phoey.
5,A toolbox of elegant implementations,We have this book in our lab and many times I've been able to refactor my own implementation after reading the code in this book. The chapter that deals with dates is very well presented and doubles as a history lesson since it covers all the adjustments that have been made to our calendar over the centuries. The source is writen in plain C so it should be easy to port to other languages.
2,Skip it!,"Let me start out by saying that I love Mary Balogh's writing, but no one bats a hundred every time.The story started out well enough. However, the female protagonist turned into some sort of psychologically and emotionally suicidal neurotic ultra-feminist. It was as if she wanted to punish the guy who loved her because of society's standards.There were many moments towards the end of the book that I thought someone should smack some sense into this girl. I also couldn't understand how the two characters possibly fell in love. They hardly spoke to or spent time with one another. It was all just too weird.I've never gotten past the third chapter of a book and not finish it, but I did this time. I just couldn't torture myself any longer. Don't buy it; I'm sure you can find people who'd be willing to give it away for free."
2,"So, so boring and deceptively marketed","I picked up this book because I wanted some trashy, mindless reading (why else would one buy a romance novel?). So far, it's been the most boring read ever, full of dull, non-compelling characters and this odd religiosity that seems very out of place. Save your money and buy something else. Since the last Balogh novel I read (Simply Unforgettable) was also a huge bore, I think I'll pass on reading her stuff.I would also like to add that there's a complete mismatch between the actual story and the way it's described on the back cover. If anything, I feel deceived by the publisher both for reprinting an old story and for failing to accurately describe it. This book is being marketed as a passionate, exciting romance novel, which it clearly is not."
3,Their service was terriffic,"The bras, which are so hard to find in stores in my size, came very promptly in one week. The quality of JMS has been the same for the years: they work well, but need stronger material"
4,Great service,"The setp up works fine.I noticed that the sockets to plug in my electrical items were loose.I contacted the dealer through customer support and they were very prompt and courteous in answering my call and helping me out with the issue. The dealer said it was a rare problem and that it will be replaced. Great service, highly recommended."
2,This might have been revolutionary twenty-five years ago!,"I have nothing but respect for Dr. Blondie Grant, but, please! People! She's about as cutting edge as Orrin Hatch."
4,Prior edition,"The third edition of this textbook is a definitive work on the art and science of nuts and bolts clinical electrophysiology. To practice competent invasive EP you need to understand pretty much everything written here, as a starting point.I don't own the latest edition but have perused it several times at meetings. I don't think it compares to other books available that cover 3D anatomical mapping and newer technologies better. If you are an EP fellow, I would recommend getting an inexpensive 3rd edition of this book and look elsewhere for the more current technology. You don't want to end up being able to do AF ablations and not understand how to diagnose an antidromic AVRT."
1,All the features I wanted but it didn't work.,"I have read other reviews that complain about the problematic nature of 5.8 GHs technology, so maybe they are right. In any event, my phone had tons of static from the start. At first I thought my phone line was at fault, but then the phone stopped working entirely. People complained that I was breaking up and impossible to understand. I didn't believe them, so I left myself voice mail messages at work and found out that I was incomprehensible my voice was breaking up so much. I tried an old phone on the same line to discover it was crystal clear, so I knew it was my Panasonic phone and not my phone line. I returned the phone and purchased a 2.4 GHz AT&T phone (I now don't trust the 5.8 GHz.) I had a 2.4 GHz Panasonic phone I loved. I have a Panasonic TV I love. But I now don't trust the 5.8 technology. And I was even more disappointed because the Panasonic phone had all the features I wanted. My new phone doesn't."
4,"A great toy for young ""puzzle doers""!","I purchased this toy for my one-year-old daughter, I wanted some educational toys for her to choose from during play. She loves the colorful animal pictures, and chooses this puzzle again and again. Not only has it introduced her to puzzle skills, it has encouraged her to begin making the animal sounds, as well as call them by name! I highly recommend it!"
4,A Lesson in the Scope of Govt,"A fascinating look at the scope of government in the 1920's. The president actually vetoed legislation, claiming that it was beyond the founders intent. (What a change from today's politicians!)This flood caused a complete change in the perception and function of government in this country. It set up the populace for the New Deal and all that followed."
4,history that explains current events,"After Hurricane Katrina, African-Americans living in the Ninth Ward swore that the levees were blown up by the government to clear away black residents and make way for the type of development in New Orleans that suited affluent whites. People said they heard the ""explosions,"" which were actually the sound of the breaking levees. Many were amused by these declarations, which became fodder for racial stereotypes leveled at these Ninth Ward residents. How stupid could they be to actually believe such a ridiculous thing???The beliefs of a people and a culture are handed up through the generations. The story of the Great Mississippi River Flood of 1927 gives reasons to these fears after Katrina ... and suggests that the people of the Ninth Ward were not just paranoid: their fears were based in historical fact.It is a story well-worth reading, both for its historical value and its relevance to current events."
5,extraordinary book,"5 stars is the most allowed, but this book rates more. Rising Tide is wonderfully written, evidences outstanding scholarship, and addresses important questions that illuminate the development of our moedern society-- especially southern society-- and how man's relationship with nature affects economic and social development. Buit I fear my description of the book makes it sound boring. Believe me, it isn't. There is a compelling narrative here with characters as brilliantly laid out as in any novel. The combination of disaster story, important issues, provocative analysis, and scholarship really do make this an extraordinary book."
3,"A fascinating event, but not a fascinating read","The subject is indeed fascinating and neglected, but the author's treatment is often annoying. The descriptions of the flood's force and devestation suffer from repetitive, empty, hyperbole. And there is too much ""deep background"" on each historical figure. Like some of the other reviewers, I appreciated the early material on civil engineering, and grew weary of the later material on Hoover and the Percy family, and the New Orleans elites. For those who are most interested in controlling the river, I highly recommend John McPhee's piece on the Atchafalya river's attempt to capture the Mississippi in ""Control of Nature."""
5,One of the best....,"This book reminded me of ""Seabiscuit,"" by Laura Hillenbrand. Take a somewhat obscure historical event and turn it into a fascinating history lesson about our culture. This is an extraordinary book."
1,Amateuristic layout designed by wanna be artists.,"Gosh.....(because I would otherwise be censored!) What a waste of a 1 year wait, and $32.00. They kept delaying the release of this book for unknown reasons. I assumed the delay was because they were updating and adding more content. It doesn't appear to be the case. This is a B/W 7x12 (dimensions were made to eliminate photo copies) paperpack. Dimensions are horrid and cramp the layout inside. Reading it is a nightmare. Margins cause left and right pages to merge. I agree, Paste a Dominos pizza menu on the front and rear covers. If this is the best of GAG, then I would recommend that you don't join the GAG, or quit the GAG. What an embarassment."
5,Great Item If You Need It . . .,"This is a high quality adapter that works flawlessly with the TC-E17 Teleconver - The main problem is finding a TC-E17ED anywhere. They are no longer made and getting more and more expensive to buy on sites like Amazon or eBay. Most are selling for more now than when they were new (over $500). If you can find the lens, it is AWESOME - and obviously, if you can find the lens, it won't do you any good without the UR-E17 Converter"
5,Saxy down memory lane,Enjoyed this cd. Every other song is a Beatle classic. Followed by jumping music from the psyhcodelic era. Memories and thinkings of what I was doing when that particular song was popular. Many wonderful thoughts were rekindled and people I haven't seen in many years.
1,Doesn't stick,"This would be great if there was actually adhesive on the back -- but there isn't. It won't stick to itself or anything else, including fork/knife/spoon handles, screwdriver handles, or the wood table we were sitting at. Unfortunately useless."
2,For riley,This product didn't fit our needs. We have a one armed grandchild that needed help keeping papers and activities in place when working and this product did not do this.
1,Does NOT stay on for long,"First of all, everyone knows to put this stuff on while still at home and cooled. It WON'T work on sweaty faces at all. But in order to even be SEEN, you have to just sorta rub the same spot over and over and over in order to get it dark enough to serve any purpose. The most disheartening part is, after all that rubbing rubbing rubbing under the eye where it's most tender, the eye black is 9 times out of 10 gone before the first inning is over. Most of those times, it wears off during warm up and it's gone before my son hits the field.I can't explain WHY this stuff doesn't work. It just doesn't."
1,worst movie ever made,"this is by far the worst movie I've ever seen. Steve Zahn, who I generally like, played a goofy stalker. it was hard to believe that Jennifer Aniston would fall for such a loser. I expected better with this cast, but even they couldn't turn this turd into a gem."
3,More of the same thing,"This film falls right into the formulae of Jennifer Aniston's other outings. That is to say it is light, it is fluffy, it is not memorable. Her agent has not ""put her out there"" and must go for broader vistas before she is too far into the over 40 territory. Though she is more beautiful than ever, Hollywood treats over 40 women badly. As in, ignores them.It is truly a pity; Ms. Aniston is 1,000 times the looks of Julia Roberts but hasn't reached the Hollywood parts that would get her an Oscar or even a Peoples' Choice Award. Bad luck, or bad press agent...To cut to the chase: if you love Jennifer no matter what, then you will already have decided to buy this film. If not, keep your money and look elsewhere."
2,"Karoke, Little Mermaid","Don't hear the granddaughter playing this one very often and they LOVE the Little Mermaid movie.Their comment is ""it doesn't sound right."""
2,Not Karaoke,"As others have mentioned. This is not a karaoke cd. The package labeling says ""On-screen Lyrics"", but there are none. It is a music CD and the quality is not from the original movie. Apparently all of Disney's ""Karaoke"" cds are the same way. Disney really had an opportunity to provide a great product for the millions of fans who love the music in the movies and blew it."
1,Product description inaccurate,"There is a problem with this product's description as it says they are ""with stems"".This is not true they are not.Watch out. It is only suitable for the double electric breast pump !!!"
3,"OK, not great","I don't really think this works. I live in No Cal, so it's not that cold here, but I find the wax cools off very quickly and the sleeve doesn't improve by much. maybe 1-2 swipes."
2,Very Disappointed,I expected more information as to dates and specific predictions for the current time period. The book was very vague and seemed to be missing much. I would not suggest this book for reading.
4,Good Recording,This is a good recording of a ballet that's rarely staged outside of Russia. I don't even recall if it was revived during the Soviet era.
2,Not Very Cosmic,"My cat ignores this stuff, and has been a Cosmic Cat for 11 years. I have even kept the original container, because I love the original artwork so much. I thought I would really treat her with this larger size. My cat does not respond to this and ignores it. I'm not even sure if this is the same Cosmic stuff that she's used to.The package itself seems generic, with only a sticker on the front of the bucket. There is no real info on the sticker either. The art is not the art depicted on the seller's example image. I would return it, but maybe my cat will change her mind. Caveat Emptor."
4,Not really nonstick,Bought this Trudeau Egg Poacher with extended handle and it works great but you have to spray a oil on it before emerging into the water. It is not really not stick but its better than scrapping a pans bottom for left over eggs!
4,Great for display,"I saw this product at a scrapbook store and had to have one. It is great to diplay cards, pictures or small embellishment packages. It is easy to put together and I put it back in the box for storage. Love it."
1,Don't waste your money,"Buyer beware! This is a terrible pump.I bought (and used) it to occasionally relieve engorgement. It broke after about 10 uses. Hand expressing or electric pumps are much more effective. I have the Medela Freestyle pump which is nearly as portable as the hand pump and much, much better.Problems:1. Unusual flange shape is uncomfortable for nipples and pinches them2. The handle only allows you to pump with high suction unless you have a very precise squeeze3. Takes forever to pump any milk4. Spills easily if tilted at all, wasting ounces of milk (when unscrewing the bottle, for example)5. Breaks and loses suction after a few weeks of use"
1,Beware of Misleading description,"Beware before buying! This product does not come with the 2 5oz bottles as advertised in the description. Just one. Amazon should modify the description to avoid people from returning this product for being falsely advertised.Id much rather buy the set from babies r us for $40 which comes with the the pump, stand,2 solid lids, 2 bottles and the travel nipple and cap."
3,electric pumps are better,"I bought this pump before baby was due thinking that it would be enough for occasional use. The product as such is good and works well but its manual so it requires a lot of effort and time to pump even 1 oz of milk.I used it 1-2 times then bought a Medela Pump in style electric pump, it was extremely convenient and didn't take a lot of time."
2,Not a daily use pump,"After a month of use, I am already experiencing a reduction in suction. I have to take the pump off of my breast every other pump to retain suction. Also, milk easily leaks from the pump to bottle connection. I had been using the pump once a day to stock milk and maintain/increase production. When I contacted Medela with questions, they sent a canned reply: ""The Harmony is not a daily use pump. This pump is for moms who pump infrequently, such as the occasional night out. Also a great backup for electric pumps. Unfortunately, this pump is not proven to increase milk production."" It would be nice if that was mentioned in the product info here."
4,Love this for late night feedings.,"I hardly ever pump, I used to pump before with a Medela Double Electric pump but it hurt! I used this pump with the soft 24m shields. I couldnt feel a thing and was pumping more than I do than with an electric pump! Love this at night for when LO only feeds on one side. it really prevents engorgement and I get to store the milk for future use!Only con is that the swivel part of this handpump is so loose. Wish it was tighter."
3,There are better manual pumps,"This pump was passable, but it had too many flaws. The handle is uncomfortable and swivels around, which I find extremely annoying. It also leaked (yes, I assembled it correctly). It doesn't pump any more efficiently than my Lansinoh manual pump (I wanted to have two pumps so I could use one while the other's parts were in the dishwasher). The Lansinoh pump is much better, has slightly fewer parts, and slightly better suction. It also has a piece that can be used as a cover for the flange or a stand for the bottle, while the Medela has no cover for the flange (at least not included with the pump, don't know if they sell one separately)."
1,don't buy this,save your money and just forget about buying a manual. Unless you're a weight lifter you'll never be able to pump for long enough to get any milk out. Invest in batteries for your electric in case of power outages if you want for that reason
4,Works great for me...,"I was a little nervous using this, so it hurt a ton the first time I used it and I only got 1 ounce out. But, I tried it again and tried to relax and easily got 3 ounces out in a little over 5 minutes. I would say this is great for the occasional use, but go with an electric if you want to pump all the time. Because my hand was kind of tired at the end of it. I can't imagine when my son wants to drink more like 6 ounces at a time..."
5,medela harmony manual breast pump,"I just had my third child, I'm a stay at home mom and I exclusively breastfeed. So that's where I'm coming from writing this review. I use my pump 1-3 times a week usually. I had an Avent Isis manual pump with my first two, which I didn't like that well. It took me a long time to pump much milk. I know that the Avent pump works great for a lot of people. I just wasn't one of them. I love this pump! This pump is easy to use and assemble! I love that it doesn't have a lot of parts. When I take it apart to clean it I feel like everything is really getting clean because the parts it has are simple. I'm easily able to express 4-5 oz. in 15 minutes (my baby is currently 2 1/2 months old). The initial quick pumping feature is nice, and so is the swivel handle. I am very satisfied with this pump!"
1,Not worth a penny,I can barely get this thing to work at all. I bought it for the diaper bag to use when I'm out and about to prevent engorgement. It doesn't work well enough for even that. I just take me electric pump and adapter and go pump in the car. This was a waste of money.
5,I LOVE this pump,"I have never ever had any problems with this pump, It's easy to clean, dishwasher safe, and it gets out a lot of milk in a short period of time. Plus it's portable so I don't have to fuss over plugging it in or anything. I have recommended this pump to all of my friends."
3,Very skimpy and uneven explanations,"There are many questions of beginning statistics which this book either has very skimpy and unsatisfactory answers or has no answers at all. For example, the book goes directly from explaining normal distribution to binomial distribution except that it never quite explains binomial distribution except from graphs. Granted, statistics concepts are very hard to explain in words. But the book seems to breeze through many important concepts with one sentence or two.The book covers the following:1)Descriptive Measure2)Probability3)Discrete Random Variables4)Continuous Random Variables5)Sampling Distributions6)Estimation and Sample Size Determination7)Tests of Hypothesis (one and two populations)8)Chi Square9)ANOVA10)Regression and Correlation11)Nonparametric StatisticsThis is not a bad supplementary workbook but it is rather poor as a primary text on statistics.Overall, I barely recommend this book for those who are beginning statistics (intended audience)."
3,Nixon Reconsidered,"Richard Reeves is a fair author. Having read his previous book on President Kennedy, I was interested in his take on Nixon. This book is not a bio, nor is it a political history per se. Rather this book, like the Kennedy and Reagan books, weaves a path through the first four years of Nixon's presidency. The age old question will always remain: how a guy as smart as Richard Nixon, and he was smart, got caught up in a bevy of intrigue, black ops, and paranoia."
3,A bit of a jumble,"This book pales in comparison to his other book on Kennedy. It isn't for a lack of high drama and important events but Reeves appears to have been hasty in assembling what must be a large volume of information. The style is not as coherent.Nixon is described as an atypical politician, in that he did not enjoy dealing with people. He spent much time in seclusion, reading, making notes and absorbing information to prepare for the next day. Nixon lacked interest in domestic issues, other than for their impact on foreign relations. He also was more interested in a crisis atmosphere than in the day-to-day, yet might decide to focus on an issue somewhat beneath the station of the President.A couple of other authors I can recommend if you want to read about Nixon are Stephen Ambrose and Anthony Summers."
4,All is fair in politics,The book paints an interesting version of the relationship between Nixon and Kissinger. The book attempts to explain how Nixon thought. The book shows that Nixon was a master politician. It shows how Nixon dealt with the quagmire of Vietnam. It discussed Nixon's thoughts on Jews and Blacks. It shows his main concern during his first term - being reelected.
1,Don't Buy It,"The description on the outside of the box is light and flowery, leading the buyer to believe she will be having lots of fun doing ""horsey"" things. This is misleading, to say the least! Once you read the introduction in the manual inside the box, you learn that you are part of a battle of horse academies. Descriptions like ""a reputation for ruthless efficiency"", ""crushed its competitiors one by one"" and ""battle of the academies will take no prisoners"" provide a much darker game description. It isn't fun! I am returning my daughter's game immediately!"
5,Almost 6.5 years and still working,"I purchased this late 2005/early 2006. We have a California room in a Mobile home. It's our cat's room. Anyway the room gets super cold and damp in the winter. I did just have 1200 CAP put on the roof of that room and that helps. When I run this that room stays not only dry but about 7-10 degrees warmer. Last night it was 39 degrees outside. 52 in the house and 61 degrees in the cat;'s room. Still works great however it is noiser in the last few years, would not want this in my house to loud, but the cats don't seem to mind it. Its on rollers so when the bathroom flooded, used it in there, when my neighbor's closet flooded from the roof, she used it, when my best friend down the street had a bedroom/bathroom flood, she borrowed it, so it has had heavy heavy use. Best 229/Lowes's investman ever."
4,"Good dehumidifier, but a little noisy","We had this dehumidifier for eight years and now it has stopped working. The motor still runs, but it does not collect water. Eight years of constant use is very good. Thanks."
1,sound like a jet engine running,"This is the loudest dehumidifier on the planet. Not only does it wake up the dead when its compressor comes on, it also shakes and rattles to produce the most annoying racket. It does not even deserve a single star rating!"
4,Good Book,"I little bit outdated now, but, the book is really good and gives plenty of insight to the way some things are in the music business and the way some things use to be. Definitely a good how to guide for anyone wanting to start their own label."
5,Great Boiler Set!!,"Got this for Xmas, have used it to make soup, rice, pasta, etc. Excellent SS set. Highly recommend."
2,another cheesy movie,again those folks who like the latino brand of bad but good crime - sex movies..this is up your alley...cheesy
4,Richie Ashburn Remembered,"I was recently the greatful recipient of the above mentioned book. This is the 3rd book I have read by author Fran Zimniuch. His (past) books answer many of the questions you ponder. Like what ever happened to ???? Fran gives it all to you. This latest book is a wonderful tribute to Richie Ashburn and you can tell that the author truely loves the sport of baseball. It is more than a story to him. Way to go Fran and keep them coming......Now what ever happened to Bobby Rydell, Don Cannon and the rest of the oldies..."
2,This book is too out of date to use.,"First off, the book is very non-linear and very disorganized. The subject material is extremely difficult and non-linear, so this was probably a very difficult book to write, and I sympathize with the authors. I couldn't have done a better job.However, as of Nov 2003, the versions of autoconf, automake and libtool that the book uses are very out of date and very deprecated. It's not a matter of ""some things have changed"", it's a matter of ""they're completely different"".The main ideas and concepts remain the same, but as for the details... you will NOT be able to use autoconf / automake / libtool after reading the book. You'll be floundering in ""did I do something wrong or is this just because I'm using a newer version?"".Do not buy this book until the authors update it. You will NOT learn the subject material and will be very sorry you spent the money."
2,An unorganized mess,"... I bought this book with the hope that random shunks of information that I already knew would be pieced together in a coherent story, based on a good foundation. Unfortunately, I found this book to be a complete unorganized mess, totally lacking a logical structure. The number of references to later chapters for essential information are just impossible to count. Concepts are suddenly used without any explanation. For me, this looked like a book written by an expert for other experts. Two stars because it is the only one available about the subject."
1,Read the GNU Manuals,"I found this book _very_ poorly organized. As one reviewer mentioned, it continually refers to later chapters.After being perplexed by this book, I read the freely available manuals and got a much better understanding.I give it one star because I like the cover."
3,"Helpful, but not for fine tuning","Didn't work as well as I imagined it would.I tweaked the sensitivity settings, but in the end the signal finder is still very jumpy. It doesn't allow much fine tuning. But, still, it's useful in the initial stages as a rough guide. For the price, having this finder is better than nothing."
3,To find a Signal,"The kit looks nice but you have to but 10 AA batteries for it, yes you heard me right 10. The compass melted within 10 minutes in the New Mexico sun so buyer beware. It did however find the satilite with ease and that tool was the main reason for buying the kit. This kit is a great start but a long way from being a great buy however for the price you can't really complain."
3,Helpful,"I feel for something involving the topic of addiction, a book needs to jump right out and offer help and very helpful information right from the beginning. I had to read in quite a bit before I felt like there is information I needed."
5,Shipwreck: A Saga of Sea Tragedy and Sunken Treasure,Mr Horner does a good job of describing the attempts of a Spanish monk to get back to his homeland and the ememy attacks that he is forced to endure on his voyage. The descriptions that he gives of his modern day salvage adventures is also very interesting. A good read.
1,Useless,"The only reason I gave this product one star is because there's no option for no stars at all. Alchemy cannot be explained by psychology or academia. In fact, alchemy and academia, and especially psychology, are completely opposite in their aims and goals. Psychology reinforces ego while alchemy dissolves it. That is why people like this and Jung should be completely ignored; they speak from a basis of clinical, academic opinion and not actual experience obtained by realization. If you, who are reading this, remembers anything from this review then I hope you at least remember that. Save your money and spend it somewhere else on things that are more important."
1,Who at the BBC thought this a good idea?,"While the idea of collections in general is a good one, this one missesthe mark on a number of levels. As others have mentioned, many people havetheir own favorites in terms of the Doctor. This bundle doesn't reallyadd anything. The BBC should really start doing as other old shows havedone and release entire seasons. Alternately, they could just start fillingin holes in the current releases. Basic things are missing like Cybermenstories. First the BBC needs to release enough material such that fanscould start piecing together entire seasons (or Doctors) on their ownand then release that (as a mega collection).The Key to Time or Trial of a Timelord are good examples of this."
2,Good Program but a Steep Price,Has been a fan of the new series on Sci-Fi and has seen little of the original. This item does sound good but the price is a bit hard to swallow. I sorta think they are going in a good direction with the release of the beginnings boxed set. They should just concentrate on releasing boxed sets like that for each individual Doctor Who having all the episode they were in. I would gladly pay over time for sets like that no matter how long it takes for them to be released instead of all these jumbled realease that try to get your money now when they will come up with something better down the line if they can.
5,what's not to like?,"Perfectly fine phone & clock radio. Integrated with Panasonic base phone it has caller ID, different ring tones & great coverage. The clock/radio is great."
5,Another success from Deitel & Deitel!,"This book is an excellent College Level textbook to learn VB.NET. Basic is as easy as it gets in programming, thus the name ""Basic"", but the Visual interface adds excitement to it. This book will not teach you VB.NET in a week, as it is huge, this book is designed to give s SOLID base on the language. If you got the time and the interest, I would definitely recommend it!"
2,Not All Books Are Created Equal,"When I was in college, I appreciated teachers who were especially effective at teaching the subject matter. They'd take a concept, build on the fundamentals and provide practical applications. In plain language, easy to understand. To this day, I value what they taught me.Other teachers weren't as effective and enduring their courses was an exercise in tolerance. I found myself saying ""WHAT??"" much more than ""Oh. I get it now"". Therein lies the difference.This book, unfortunately, falls into the second camp. I don't like to be critical, but when authors fail to teach, it's best to seek other sources.If you are a CFA candidate, I encourage you to invest in Schweser, Stalla or Allen Resources material instead. You'll come away with a much better understanding of foreign exchange fundamentals, international equity and debt investments, and currency risk management.Anybody want to buy a used book cheap?"
1,Misinformative and Not Recommended.,"I'd hoped to find a decent overview in this small volume. However, Southworth consistently calls a rifle magazine a ""clip,"" isn't clear on the difference between normal payload and emergency maximum payload of a C-130 Hercules, states the maximum range of the Mark 45 naval gun to be 63 miles, which is only true for a hideously expensive prototype round that likely won't be fielded, exaggerates the capabilities of the Browning .50 and classifies Thompsons and M3A1 carbines as ""squad weapons"" at one point. And I'm not positive from the picture, but his ""M249 SAW"" looks awfully like an M240B machine gun.I didn't care for the prose. It was the sort of chat you get from drunken wannabes or recruits about how great certain things are in comparison, without any real-world feedback on how things work.I'm afraid the enthusiasm was lost in about a minute, and I expect to get rid of this one quickly. It's no use as a reference and not that entertaining."
1,chain,"broke after less than 2 weeks - too fine, no strength, would not recommend for use with any pendant - so what's the point?"
4,So cute!,"I bought the butterfly plaque for my daughter and the sports plaque for my son. They are absolutely adorable. The only problem is that they bang against the door when you open and close it, which is a con when the kids are sleeping. We had to put tape on the backs of them to remedy this."
1,Very sloppy work - Outdated and inaccurate,"I was so excited to get this book so I could take my grandchildren rock hunting. I then Googled 'rock shop Oregon' to find a rock tumbler I could give them for Christmas. In the search results for a rock shop, I saw a listing for Reasons Not To Buy Gem Trails of Oregon. I am so glad I did not plan a huge disappointing trip with the kids using this book as a guide. Although we didn't experience the disappointments personally- there are so many frustrated people out there about the inaccurate information in this book that I am just going to throw it away."
2,"Good features, Bad performance","I have always used Panasonic phones. I just loved the feel and look of this phone the moment I saw it. There are so many new features and I was upgrading from a 900 MHZ, so was excited on starting to use it. The features were so easy to set up - then, I started talking - only my friends could not hear me ! Frustrated, they had to call me on my cell phone or asked me to call them on my cell phone. Finally, got tired of using cell phone for local calls too. Tried calling Panasonic who put me on hold for half an hour. Though I loved the 'Pause' feature to enter the long winded calling card numbers and their pins and my 2 year old loved to change the ringer tune every few minutes, we had to return the phone after seeing our cell phone bill ... We were surprised to find many 'Open Box' items for this model in Best Buy - maybe an indication ????"
1,"Great features, poor sound quality","This phone has all the features I could ask for..... However, the sound quality and signal range are very poor. The voices sound very tinny and garbled at times. The signal would drop out at relatively short distances of about 50 feet away from the base.I have a 6 yr old Sanyo 900 Mhz phone that beats this on distance and sound quality.When is Panasonic going to make a good sounding phone ? We also have two of the 2.4 Ghz phones and they're only ok.This 5.8 Ghz is a new low in sound quality and signal range.I'm returning mine tomorrow. :-("
1,Your friends will hate you,"Everbody I talked to hated this phone, they wanted to know what the problem was, even when I was right next to the base unit! I took it back for a refund. I saw another reviewer had the exact same experience, so ask your callers about the quality of the sound within your return period.A couple of other things I didn't like:* only 2 digits for remote access code.* No message waiting indicator for central station voicemail. I have voicemail as a backup and would like an indicator for this."
2,Defective Panasonic KX-TG5240M GigaRange Supreme 5.8 GHz DSS Expandable Cordless,"Defective product, the phone has static/noise, and the people on the other end can not understand what is being said because of the static/noise. I tried to send in the warranty and found that that the company is no longer in business, therefore I'm stuck with a defective phone..."
2,It's Okay If You Don't Move Your Laptop Around Too Much,"this product was ok. Only lasted me a year and I'm already having to buy a new wireless keyboard. The headset was the first to mess up. I used it often and it seemed cheap and flimsy. For some reason the speaker wire split and it's now hard to use on my laptop. It's a great combination to have for a computer user but a laptop user that moves around a bit may not want to buy this item because it wears so easily. I probably won't recommend this to my friends. if you're a pc user and you need some basic, this may be a good buy. The good thing is I only used one battery for the mouse and it worked perfectly. I also like the keyboard a lot. I wish they just sold the same model keyboard individually because I would buy that."
3,backpack pot,"I didn't want an asparagus steamer, but I thought this would suit my purpose: to fit a Coleman 440 stove. I didn't want heavy stainless, with a weighted bottom, and the low price for this item suggested it would be thin and tinny: just the thing.It was too tall, but otherwise perfect. I cut off 2.5 inches (wear goggles next time) and smoothed down the edges. Wooden knobs to replace the cut off part.The basket? I can use that for cleaning parts."
2,User Manual Regurgitation,"I have found nothing in this book that isn't available for free online or in downloads from Microsoft. I wonder why so many computer book authors feel that a re-editing and repackaging of free, widely available product usage advice provides ample reason to ask a customer to shell out money? It's a false promise. Even the ""how to do everything"" angle is frankly no more than a re-presentation of applications that Microsoft describes just as well for free (and with code) online."
4,Separate Cases,"I thought I would share that these movies come wrapped together, but with separate cases. I found it a pleasant surprise when they arrived.I haven't watched A Grandpa for Christmas yet, but I enjoy The Christmas Card. It's a sweet story, and a good reminder of all our men and women serving overseas at Christmas time."
4,"Didn't think I would finsh the book, but ended up really liking it","I read the first 1/3 of the book and was totally engrossed in Rafe and Maggie's meeting and the beginning of their relationship. When Lonnie entered the picture I almost stopped reading the book. I hate reading books were a young women is tortured and abused for years by someone she should trust. Anyway, I kept on reading and really enjoyed the book overall. I loved it when Rafe realized how he had manipulated Maggie to marrying him and then totally changes the way he treats her. I enjoyed reading how he gets her to trust and love again. It was really lovely the amount of love Rafe had for Maggie, and it turn how Maggie comes to realize it and love him back. Overall it was well worth reading and I really enjoyed it."
3,critque,"Bruckner is, or can be, a tedious composer who repeats passages for no reason known to those who listen. His symphonies are long and are soemtimes slowly presented to the point of tension. Celibidache is interesting to observe as he milks measures for content that, after having been repeated in rehearsals over and over again, seem to have little, if any, audio effect to anyone else. He is a master of knowing the music. Bruckner is one composer who brass players should adore. Frankly, the brass effects are the most compelling and most interesting and without them there would be no need to sit through the works."
3,Interesting concept,Enjoyed....but not overjoyed? I'd like to see what the next novel looks like now that the author has broken the ice.
4,dr. timmy,"to me leary is always a good read, it's always reckless with your sence""sif nothing more, you'll come away with something somewhere ofsomething you've never seen or hear before, that's for sure.perhaps 4 star is to much, maybe 3.2395 stars.this is more of leary's life and reflections there of.if you're interested in the life and thoughts of timmy, read on."
5,Calms toddler and mommy!,"This book is probably the favorite at our house! I just couldn't help but sing it from the very first time I picked it up. My daughter is two now and we have a ton of fun with the book- she knows every type of animal, what their baby is called, and we play a game naming the mother and her babies after counting them. The illustrations are beautiful and I bet you will be singing the words in a lullaby tone after reading it just once!"
4,Fantastic Photography!,The photos in this book are absolutly amazing! There is an abundance of information on fetal develpement. I would suggest this book to anyone who is pregnant or thinking of becoming pregnant. My only complaint is that there is a gap in the photos of gestational develpement where there are no pictures for a few months to compare you own baby with.
2,Not as good as Geraldine Page version,No chemistry and as I recall Truman Capote narrated the older version. I often wonder at the ego it takes to remake Tinker Tailor with Alec Guinness. Patty Duke meanders through the role with occasional splashes of the querky charm of Gerald Page's performance.
5,Love This Tape!!!,"I just tried this tape for the second time today and I love it!! I feel my arms and thighs tightening already!This tape is similar to Minna Lessig's Emergency Workout---2 30 minute workouts, first half cardio, second half toning. Some of the music is the same. Both videos are designed to jumpstart your fitness routine. I enjoy Emergency Workout, but I like this video more because the cardio is more intense and higher impact and the toning section is more thorough. Toning is split into lower and upper body and ab work. I found it easier to concentrate on form because I'm not working so many muscle groups at one time. Tracy and Michelle work well together and do an excellent job cuing the moves. The routine is fun and easy to follow. A diet is also included with the workout.Highly recommended!!!"
4,Great cardio workout plus toning,"I really liked this workout, it's a fun 30 minute challenging hi/low cardio workout followed by a 30 minute weight/toning section with some abs thrown in at the end. I can't speak for the ""7 day"" program you're supposed to do the cardio for 7 days with 3 of those days including the toning section.Other comments: If you have Minna Lessig's Emergency Workout program, it's almost a replication of it. The nutrition program, the notion of needing to jump start your workout program (hence the '7 day' solution), the music is identical to the Emergency Workout (Latin style) and many of the moves are similar to Minna's too. Although for some reason, the audio didn't come in as good as it did in Minna's VHS."
3,Hit and miss,That seems to be my opinion of SD's Vampire series. Didn't like the first--loved the 2nd and the 3rd--and I'm almost inclined to say she should have quit after thoose for the fourth and fifth I really disliked.Then along comes Dead by Dusk--and it is another keeper....
1,Assumptions based on assumptions.,"Frankly, I'm unimpressed. The author claims to know may things he does not. Firstly, he's obvioulsy working from a 20th/21st century perspective. Would going through a Wendy's drive through make sense coming from a First Century source? No. Of course not. So we must read the Scriptures from their appropriate context. He fails to do so. Secondly, his arguement that God cannot be trinity and unity is based on being and not persons. Let's use the St. Patrick's example. A three-leaf clover has three separate and different leaves, right? But it's still one three-leaf clover, right? Three leaves, one essence of a three-leaf clover. Three persons, one divine essence."
1,Who is reading this idiocy?,"I got through ten pages, which wasn't easy. By then it's evident that this 'author' is grossly ignorant of just about everything biblical (and grammatical); he simply snatches phrases here and there and starts screaming.I was lucky and re-sold mine, although I feel guilty about such a sleazy maneuver. If you're looking for an intelligent critique of Christianity, go elsewhere. If you're after a hysterical, badly written, error-packed, horribly biased and totally uninformed tantrum on paper, then get this."
1,A Waste Of Money!,"I don't know what those people up above were on, but this is the most sloppy book I have ever read. It looks like an extended version of a high school essay. The research, far from being complete, is hap-hazard and in several places blatently untrue. Though I agree that Christianity in general is a horrible pox on the face of the earth, I would have to suggest finding ANY other book on the subject... this guy obviously has an axe to grind, and his work suffers for it. A more personally-detached style would be necessary to make this book something other than an infinitely extended whine."
3,Knee replacement surgery,"Quick, easy install. A bit on the narrow side for my size, but once I removed one side, it worked well."
1,Disappointment,"What a disappointment! This poorly made DVD has more awful (and low budget) musical numbers and cartoons than it has actual Bush clips. I was hoping for a DVD full of video Bushisms, and instead I got a few clips that were heavily (and not very comically) commented on and actual musicalesque dance numbers! I gave this to my husband for Christmas and I wish I hadn't wasted the money."
3,Retraction of earlier review,"Well, I gave this CD another listen this year, and I have to say that my criticism from last year was overly harsh.I'm still not completely enthralled with it, but it 's nowhere nearly as bad as I said it was. Having said that, I still think that if it were anyone other than Anne Sofie von Otter, I probably wouldn't have kept the CD this long."
1,Disappointing,"I'm a big Anne Sophie Von Otter fan, but this CD is terrible. The arrangements are sophomoric, New-Agey and irritating. Her singing, as always, is beautiful, but the version of ""Tomorrow Will Be My Dancing Day"" has got to be one of the worst I've heard."
2,Overly Simplistic,"I picked up this book to get an overview of the PHP language itself. I was very disappointed and found the book to be overly simplistic, devoting too much time to explaining basic programming concepts (such as 'what is a variable?') and not enough time on the language itself. Its one saving grace is the detail on how to validate input to avoid problems of people including HTML or code designed to destroy your database.So, overall its ok if you know nothing about programming, but for an experienced programmer it contains very little of value."
3,"well researched, but very dry reading","The facts and details are good, but it reads like high school history textbook. Overall, book is ok, but can wait for paperback edition."
2,"Review of ""Goldman Sachs""","I cannot give this volume a very positive review.This is a very good book to read on the development of the company and on the internal workings of Goldman Sachs- which is one of the world's great investment banks.The difficulty arises from the author's strong bias toward the positive, which is reflected in the subtitle of the work. This bias penetrates the work in all aspects of the operation- culture, people, history, etc.Yes, it is a strong company, but it has made its share of mistakes, most notably in the book in aligning itself with the ""false tycoon"" Robert Maxwell and his dealings. The various mistakes made along the way are polished over by the author or ignored entirely.Again, I would raise my review from two stars to four with the caveat that the reader view the book as part history lesson and part unabashed advertisement while consuming its wisdom.John KerchevalGeorgetownWashington, DC"
5,Simple Easy to use,"Saxon Phonics 2 An Incremental Development Home Study Teacher's ManualVery easy to use. Simple work page using 1 page per day sometimes 2. I use the spelling words 5 per day and test at the end of the week. If your looking for diagraphing, dissecting a words into vowels and consonants this book is for you. This workbook is pretty much useless without the teacher's manual. Parent/Teacher Manual for Saxon Phonic and Spelling 2 is extremely easy to use. The manual comes with a lesson script and explains everything for each lesson and workbook page in the students book. The manual also shows the workbook sheets with answers for each lesson. Even though the entire Saxon Phonics2 and Spelling kit comes with word cards and little phonics books in my opinion you don't need them if your exposing your child to other resources that go along with what the lesson is teaching."
4,Very informative,I'm a beginner to gardening and found this to be a wonderful book. It even has a section on which conifers (Christmas-tree-type trees) can be grown in containers. This is great - I'm going to grow my own little forest on my balcony.
5,Traditional & Contemporary Bluegrass done right!,"Although the late John Duffy, founder of the group is no longer with us, this album server as a fitting reminder of the group's tight, clean renderings of both old & new songs. Excellent selections"
1,I hate rust!!!!,"item is great looking, but definitely not good for a bathroom! bathroom has lots of moisture which comes from the shower after showering. after 3 months of having this item, it started to rust, which started to run down on my white walls int he bathroom and my walls were stained. Would be a good item for a pantry or laundry room to hold items on such as detergent and canned goods but not in a bathroom for towels etc."
4,towel bars,"nice look likes in a hotel bathroom. However, the price is much more than that in Target."
2,"Low quality, not as pictured.","Do not be fooled by the picture; the shelving is cheaply made. There are large holes where the curved bars intersect with the wall supports. They didn't even take the time to solder them so that they'd look decent. The finished assembled product looks like you should have paid $7 for it, tops. Shoddy looks aside, it'll probably do the job for holding a few towels. If the picture actually looked like the product, however, I would not have purchased this."
4,1000 Hells: Yama Kings Galore,"The 1000 Hells book is one of the better supplements White Wolf has published. It contains descriptions of several Yomi Realms (especially the Wicked City is a very interesting Realm) and has biographies of the most (in)famous Yama Kings. It gives examples of Demon Servants and other antagonists to use in a Yomi chronicle, and has expanded rules on akuma (Yama Infernalist Investments and such - very good stuff!). All in all, definately worthwhile the money if you play a KotE chronicle which involves the Yomi World."
3,Good quality but runs small,The shoe is pretty and well made but runs small. The top of the shoe seems narrow and it squeezes the top of my foot. Don't know if the shoe would stretch if worn but I would recommend sizing up. Ended up returning and Amazon charged $3.99 for the return shipping.
4,"Great printer, you want believe how good it is.","I don't have much to add beyond what others have said. This printer is pretty fast, does great on pictures. And generally just does a nice job. This is my first non-HP printer. My Photosmart 1000 died, but I don't miss it now.Individuals ink cartridges are nice. The way it closes up completely when not in use is very nice in a home environment. I will say the various trays and such when folded out seem pretty flimsy. They haven't been a problem they just don't engender a feeling of solidity. But everything works great. This did keep me from giving it 5 stars however.When closed up reminds me of a mid-50's styling somehow. Not in a bad way, just different than some other styles.But where else do you get a machine that prints pretty quickly, very nicely and does very well as a photo printer for such a low price. Even better, it can print on both sides of the paper. Too good."
3,Beware -- not really Mac compatible,"This is a nice little Windows printer. For my Windows output, I like it. If I had only a Windows box, I might give it 4 or 5 stars.But while the PIXMAs are marketed as Mac compatible, this is misleading. The drivers from Canon are basically non-standard and don't work with CUPS. This means that the printer cannot be used by a Mac over a network, something which is mentioned nowhere in the documentation. I spent hours trying to get the thing to work before looking at the Discussions forum at the Apple website, where I saw about a million postings of people with the same problem. On the Canon site and in the documentation, nothing.So be careful! This printer is not what it is advertised to be."
5,My Toaster Oven,"I wanted both a photo printer and good text printer in a fairly small footprint. The Canon iP4000 has met those requirements, along with providing good print speed for an inkjet. I can't brag on the documentation, however, and any purchaser has to take into account the cost to provide your own USB cable."
5,As Good As It Gets,"I was stunned after I printed my first photo with this printer. It is literally just as good as prints from a professional developer.My admittedly untrained eye could see no imperfections, no irregularities, no discolorations, nothing to suggest that this wasn't in fact developed by a professional.Set-up is a breeze, and takes less than 10 minutes. A ten year old child could do it easily. Even the software that comes with the printer doesn't completely suck like most of the free software that comes along with your hardware purchases does.Amazing."
5,"A printer, that is perfect for the cat owner.","Really good printer, replaced my old Epson Stylus, that emptied very expensive ink carts, just by turning it on.The Epson usualy emptied my colour cart, only by the automatic and often occuring headcleaning on startup & printing.Perfect for my cat too, I just use the lower paper compartment, keeping the top lid closed, with a piece of cloth on top.My old Epson was really making strange grating noises from the gravel and dirt, that came from my outdoor type of cat, when he slept on the printer.The best feature on this printer for me, is that there is a separate, large black ink cart, as I usually only print text.Was thinking of buying a colour laser, but then I understood, from a review on druckerchannel.de, that this inkjet is as cheap, or cheaper than a laser on b/w text output.And much better quality, when printing pictures."
5,Great Printer,"I bought this printer last night and had it set up in no time. I printed pictures using the software that came with the printer. No problems...pictures were awesome. Printer is very quiet and pretty fast. Next I hooked up my new Fuji S3100 digital camera directly to the printer. It interfaced perfectly and I printed a sample picture. No problems once again. Haven't tried any basic printing yet since I bought it primarily to print pictures. I've already got my USB ports full so I used the parallel port. Worked fine.For the price, this is a great printer."
5,"Man, WHAT a cd! I hope melodic metal is on it's way back!","What a VOICE! How does Tony do it? The infectious melodies...the soaring harmonies...where do they come from? A true GOLDEN THROAT! Of course, Ronni's not too shabby himself! A truly EXPLOSIVE band..."
1,An Outdated Book on Cavy Care,"As a new guinea pig owner, I bought this book based on positive reviews here. However, after reading just a few pages it was very obvious that this book is outdated and should not be used as a reference or a go-to guide for piggie owners. The best thing about the book are the photos. The author, who is not a vet, makes recommendations to readers that go against proper, modern care for cavies. He advises piggie owners to perform health maintenance practices that should only be done by a vet. He does not promote currently accepted housing.I do not recommend this book to any future or present guinea pig owner. Piggie owners are better served by reputable websites which are current in the care of cavies. I gave the book one star because a zero star rating is not an option."
2,Very Late Review,"When I purchased the book, the seller, who had good ratings, had listed the book as being in good condition. The title I received had writing all over the very first page and the spine had a lot of wear damage and/or fraying at both the top and bottom. If I hadn't had a friend who wanted and didn't mind the condition, I would have returned the book. In addition, I wouldn't have bought the book in the condition it was had it been sitting on a shelf in a bookstore because of the damage."
1,Fast forward review,"You would think that any Ilsa flick would have sexy sleaze potential, but there aren't really any keeper scenes here. It sounds good on paper, a bomb stuffed up a girl, but nothing really gets shown except fake blood spattering around. There's a chatisty belt scene that maybe rates a partial star (but is demoted due to excess hirsuteness), but that's about it. There's not even that much here for gore fans. Zero stars."
2,Same old Ilsa!,"Once again Dyanne Thorne, the busty ""She Wolf of the SS"" is up to her old tricks (torture, S&M sex, bad acting). This time she's the harem keeper for a psycho oil sheik in some unkown Arab country. Let's get real, the ""Ilsa"" series main attraction is for Ms. Thorne to display her amazing body in tight fitting outfits and/or totally nude (although she is upstaged in that department by two athletic body guards who wrestle naked). On the plus side (if you're a guy), you get to feast your eyes on numerous naked women with truly standout figures. On the negative side, most of them get tortured in some idiotic plot involving spys, oil rights and a missing heir. The torture scenes were (I guess) an attempt at kink, but come off as just sick. The acting goes from campy to wooden, and the sex scenes (which must have been hot stuff back in the early 70's)are lame. All in all, be ready to use the 'fast forward' button."
5,Another Winner!,"This book is very good! Ibn is a riot, and Tiffany did it her way. I appreciated the well developed characters and the authors high brow sense of humor. These were truly ""Good Peoples""!"
2,Excruciatingly boring,"Much as I would love to look like the girls in these tapes, I can't believe these workouts are going to get me there. I did these routines pretty faithfully for over a month and see no difference ... probably because you barely feel anything when you do them. Brad's chatter is awful, all geared to what you're going to look like rather than any kind of health improvement (and I really don't appreciate hearing a man talk about ""monthly bloat""). Spending a little money on a better set and more than one camera (so that it's not just one angle for the entire routine) might have helped a bit, but still might not have been enough. I have retired these as way too boring and not effective enough. Sorry, Brad."
5,The Band shopuld be bigger than it is!,"Awesome Band have been a great fan for 20 some years even know this album is without the original singer""MIDNIGHT"" who sadly past recently in 2009 due to liver and kidney failure. The band in the early 90""s replaced the singer Midnight with Wade Black who in this album shows that he was a near perfect replacement and I only say near perfect because you can't replace Midnight but again Crimson Glory in this album prove they know how create music with another stellar album I would challenge anyone to find a bad song on this album or for that matter any of of there albums. This album rocks and will always stay in my collection even after I wear this CD out I will then replace it again.THANKS CRIMSON GLORY LOVE YOU R>I>P MIDNIGHTFAN FOREVER"
2,"I'm in Pain...MIDNIGHT, WHERE ARE YOU?","Actually, it wasn't THAT bad. There were quite a few good tracks (Astroninica, and Touch the Sun), but there were a few really BAD tracks as well (Lucifer's Hammer, and Cyberchrist). Your best bet is to buy this CD used, and use a rewritable CD Rom drive to erase all the lousy tracks off of it."
5,great emo-core/indie compilation from known/unknown bands,"This disc is a must-have compilation of bands on deep elm and some bigger labels. the bigger bands on this are triplefastaction, jimmie eat world, and samiam, but there isn't a bad song on here. check out lazycain and the triplefast songs. i don't own numbers 2 and 3 yet, but believe me, i'm getting them as soon as i have the money. if you like emo, or if you want an introduction, or you just want to listen to some really intense stuff, get this."
2,"Maybe, NOT, in Missoula","Maybe Toni Volk only has one good novel in her, because Maybe in Missoula isn't just inferior to her first novel, it's downright bad. The characters are flat and empty and the plot is dull. Annie is a woman with no direction--she takes a big step leaving her husband and then just seems to drift along in life, making very little decisions about her own life. The only positive thing I can say, is that the reader does get a nice feel for life in Montana. Volk obviously knows and loves the area."
3,Not bad,"I love Aventura and purchased this CD because I wanted a couple of songs that were on this CD. While those songs I enjoy, I'm not so crazy about the rest of this CD. I don't really care for the skits. It wasn't bad, but I wasn't entirely crazy about it either. I basically got this CD for free do to a gift card, so that worked for me. If it wasn't for that, I don't think I would enjoy this CD as much."
4,not bad,"it's a medium-size box. what more do you need? Great for my sewing-and-crafts storage. Pro tips: there are no little separators inside the box, it'll all just jumble around inside, so keep that in mind. Also! You should get stickers or whatever to decorate the outside with, because it's kind of plain."
1,no good,they are rather large and my kitty didnt like their smell. she sniffed one and then just walked away and never ate it. this is the first kitty treat i have had that my cat doesnt like.
4,The Week France Fell,"The Week France fell is an excellent book that discusses, not only the military instability, but the political instablity of France and its allies in 1940. The book explains and discusses the Dyle plan that the allies put into place for the defence of France and Belguim. The book portrays the military outdated philosophy of the French fighting machine, in addition to a breach in the chain of command due to replacement of the CIC. This book covers other topics, including the fall through of the French_British alliance for defence in addition to the collapse of confidence in the Cabinet of the President and Prime Minister in France. This book is an excellent work and very information"
3,A Western with realism,"An Indian chief kidnaps a women and her brother in a story about revenge. This movie has it all: drama, comic relief, action, violence, and suspense. A treat for hardcore western fans. The beautiful cinematography adds realism."
3,It was entertaining and delightful,"While it's not classic material, the story line was interesting and the actors were believable. It surprises me that anyone could find fault with this movie especially when we now have such hits(and I use the term loosely) as Austin Powers, Southpark, American Pie.......etc. Winterhawk is definitely worth seeing."
5,WINTERHAWK,"I first saw this movie when it was first released to theaters. This movie was way ahead of its time, a movie about Native Americans that showed them in a good light. The movie was filled with action, love, compasion, and much more. I loved it in 1975 and still love it today. This movie is good for nearly all age groups, has minor bad language, some killing (of course) but without blood being shown etc. You find yourself tearful at the end, a mix of tears of joy and sadness."
4,Pleased with this books information.,This book gave me a greater insight into the emergence of developing thought and reflection to gain intelligence.
1,High expectation,Applied multiple times different days and end results left more water mark spots then before now need to replace the glass
1,Do not buy!,"I bought these covers last year and they cracked and split right away. Even as I was taking them off my chairs to throw them away, they tore into shreds. And I live in California--very mild weather. Save yourself some $$ and don't buy this product."
4,Good value,"I was a little worried when the 1st 3 girls had ""over-inflated party balloons"" but there were some nice natural girls as well. A good variety overall. The camera man gets some nice close-up shots. You get to see every little bump on some of these girls nipples.The risque factor is prodably slightly higher than Playboy. The emphasis is on boobs but you get some down below shots as well. Sometimes they actually focus a little too much on the face with the close-ups.Some girls are better than others & I wouldn't call any of them absolute top notch but it was an overall good DVD that fit my taste well enough. 3 hours for roughly $5.00 used def. gave me my monies worth.I actually found the music to be on the boring ""elevator music"" side but there's no commentary so you can easily put it on mute & play whatever you like for a better veiwing experience. Hence the music is kind of a moot point IMO. Let's face it, these kinds of things are mainly about the visuals."
3,This book is about a horrible crime...,"This was a well written true crime book. The story was horrible and I just couldn't believe this man could shoot an innocent baby, not once but twice. How bad can a person be? I am an avid true crime buff. This man takes the cake as far as the most cold hearted, creature ever to walk the face of this earth."
5,Excellent read. I highly recommend!,This is my other favorite book by Bragg. Ava's Man and All Over but the Shoutin' are two of the best books I have ever read. I am a fan of all of Bragg's books but if I had to choose only one it would be hard to choose between the two.
4,Welcome to the South,"Rick Bragg's novel is a wonderful collection of detailed and descriptive stories that depict the drama he endured throughout his life. The fact that he can tell a story in just a few pages is a strength in his writing because it allows the reader to start and stop at his or her own pace. Because this is such a daunting read, it can be tiresome. I think thatin some parts of the book the details are overwhelming. I enjoyed reading this book and would recommend it to anyone who has lived in the south or who has had a father come back from war a different man. The power of persistency in Bragg's book is inspiring and may even rub off on the reader."
2,This book is a disappointment.,"Rick Bragg writes like someone who feels like he doesn't deserve his success--and he's right. Having grown up poor in the South, I was hoping for some wonderful, crystalizing story that exposed the humor and terror. But this is no Angela's Ashes of the Bible Belt. Bragg lacks humor and a sense of what is important. He has that annoying habit that bad southern newpapermen have of including too many homespun details--like someone's great strawberry shortcake or a recipe for red-eye gravy. He relies heavily on cliches and picturesque similes which may impress Yankees, but do little for those of us who have heard them all a thousand times. I have read this kind of writing my whole life and I remain unimpressed."
2,Interesting read about the South.,"This book is both a tribute the author's Mother and a reflection on his own accomplishments, despite his growing up as ""white trash"" in the South. I found it difficult to read in large blocks because at did seem at times to be bragging, and our church reading group had mixed reviews about it, for many of the same reasons. I doubt I would have picked it up if we had not had it as one of selections. I congratulate the author on his accomplishments, but this bio/autobio missed the thrill level for me."
3,It was as if there were two separate books in one.,"The first section of the book dealt with the author's early years, and it was quite interesting. However, before you knew it, it became an opportunity for the author to brag to a captive audience. Something very important was missing between the two sections. The author seems cold and incapable of any intimacy. Every good writer needs to share acertain intimacy with his readers, and Bragg does not do this. Why did he stop his childhood memoirs so abruptly? Why did he think we would enjoy his detached description of his successes? Actually, he writes well and confidently. However, he is not a very interesting and deep person."
5,"At the expence of sounding trite, it's a ""must read.""","I have just finished reading Bragg's book. Never before have I read anything more honest, open and unassuming as this! Excellent! It should be in every home; right next to the Bible. Bragg does more than any other author I know of to demonstrate, with great clarity, why mothers deserve to be honored. As a burgeoning writer, I have learned a great deal about the ""hows"" of writing something truly meaningful. The combination of humor and stark honesty blend well to tell a truly interesting and deeply compeling story. Way to go, Rick!!!"
4,The Real Steel Magnolia,"This book is the ""real-life"" story of the strong southern woman, a genre that has been examined in so many great novels. In an unusal twist, this autobiography is told from the perspective of her son instead of the typical southern woman novel which uses a daughter as the narrator. This subtle perspective shift illuminates Bragg's strong but ambigious love for his mother while he struggles into his own manhood.His writing style is journalistically concise, choosing the precise details to bring this story of poverty and love to full life.I feel of the grit between his toes and the heart-swelling optimism of mankind."
4,like butter,"In ""All over but the shoutin',"" Rick Bragg portrays the stark realities of life as a southern boy in the 1960's. This book intends to honor his mother but also serves as a means of therapy. It reaches above specific boundaries for an audience, and is therefore widely readible.One of the strengths of Rick's style is his wonderfully lyrical voice. His writing flows smoothly like butter off the side of corn on the cob.mmmmmmm! One example is on page 171 where he makes it very comfortable and understandable to relate. There is an underlying grace throughout the text. For instance, on page 166, within a few paragraphs we know what's going on and it happens so easily.As far as weaknesses go, I believe that if there are any, they are insignificant when compared to the strengths. I don't see any flaws in this book, in my opinion.I would recommend this book to anyone interested in Southern Literature, especially when compared to other texts I have read."
4,Going from the pits to the pinnacle,"I rarely do biographies, so this was not something I would normally read, or even know about, except for a book club meeting. It's about a man who was born ""poor white trash"", to a loving, but whipped Mom and an alcoholic Dad fighting Korean War demons. It's about his life growing up and into a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper man. It talks about some of his stories, most of which are on, what he called ""the dark side"". It has it's laugh-out-loud parts, and the cry-out-loud parts, and the descriptions of Haiti are unbelievable. I think I recommend this, but it's not for everyone, especially those who are sensitive."
1,Self-centered,Lewis Grizzard has the real stuff from the South; ignore this pretentious Harvard wanna-be. Poorly written and executed
4,Great Book,I knew nothing about VB before purchasing this book. I need to write some Excel Macros and this book helped tremendously.
4,Glory to Gloria and Camille!,"Reading this new ""elemental"" murder mystery by this talented and inventive physicist-author was again a treat. By now, reading how retired scientist Gloria Lamerino is coping with a blooming romance in middle-age, while immersed in crime investigations and targeted by murderous threats is like visiting with old friends. In her fifth mystery the author involved scientists and scientific uses of the title element (Boron) only incidentally, Alas! But she managed to come up with credible lethal mixtures of old history and passions enabled by the new (journalists and librarians searching the internet, nuclear power and nuclear waste, role models for coed highschools). The gentle mixture of the traditional (old friendships, family, love of food) and the novel (female scientist becoming a police technical consultant in her retirement) and the unexpected plot twists make this a wonderful read, with plenty of food for thought, for all ages."
4,Good book,I am doing Inner Bonding/child work and I find this to be a good accompaniment. I just wish there was a page titled Sadness and Loneliness as these are the two feelings I am dealing with as I learn to attend to my feelings.
5,Great product and easy install,Easy to install and looks great. Installation was easy to understand and took only about 1 hour to do it myself. Only thing is that I had trouble with is not with the product but cleaning the threaded hole in the body to get the bolts in. After thoroughly cleaning with a wire battery terminal cleaner and some cleaner to get rid of the corrosion the bolts went right in. Install looks good and would recommend to buy this product.
5,One of the founding fathers of Bluegrass.,"Any album is a good one, but this one has some of his greatest early works too. Great add to your bluegrass library."
2,WHY!,"Ok, first off, I love Nickelback. But WHY are they releasing yet another music video dvd. They first released one in 2004, then another one a few months later, the only difference was the amount of music video. Here we are in 2007 and Nickelback has ANOTHER video collection dvd, the only difference is like 2 or 3 music video wasen't featured on the last dvd release, like ""Rockstar"" ""If everyone cared"" Comeon Nickelback STOP releasing these music video collection dvds already. Never knew they where as MONEY HUNGRY like this before, save your money, just download the newer videos."
5,The Best!,"Dr.Alvis' study is truly remarkable. Honor is the theme of politics - there are few motives that drive man to serve the common-weal. This said, Alvis is not satisfied to sift through the verities of political life, he is also interested in the life that is beyond the political stage. The true merit of this book lies in Alvis' ability to see the noble within an emaciated Denmark or a womanized England.For those interested in the true greatness of Shakespeare, this is your only stop. What kind of knowledge do the great ones have? What is the motivation for the philosopher to engage in public life. No one understands the theoretical life, as presented by Shakespeare, as well as Alvis."
4,Great HLN show!,"The great: I'd have given a 5/5 here. HL still got it and most of their hits are here. The audio and video quality of this DVD is great too.The not-so-great: The reason i'm giving this DVD a 4/5. Maybe i'm being a bit hard on HLN but Chris Hayes (original HLN lead guitarist) did some absolutely SMOKIN' solos on ""Working for a Living"" and some other tracks that i can't remember off-hand. Sadly, Stef Burns didn't attempt to reproduce them and as a result, i felt that those songs lost a bit of their energy and ""hard"" edge here. From his solo run on ""Doing it all for my baby"", you can tell that Stef's definitely got the ability but he didn't show it that much in this otherwise great performance. Recommended for all HLN fans."
2,"All Right, Not Great","This book is all right, but not great. A little too expensive for its quality. It's not very updated it doesn't feel like. It is not with the times of this day and age. Unfortunately, it's one of the few Maid of Honor books out there and I was trying to ask my sister to be my maid of honor. I wanted to do so by giving her a book on how to be a maid of honor, and this was the one of two out there."
2,Very basic,"This book was ok. I was hoping for a little more detail or delving into the maid of honor duties as opposed to bridesmaid duties and this book failed to deliver. It is very simple, perhaps good for a junior bridesmaid?"
1,Not worth it,I got this for my sister (MOH) and she thought it was a joke. The sample toasts that they had in there were terrible!
1,If you're planning the wedding for the bride - then buy this.,"I've been to plenty of weddings, I've just never been a maid of honor and just wanted to make sure I knew what I was in for. This book goes on to tell you that you will be contacting the guests, making sure the flowers arrive on time and basically being a wedding planner. I could tell it was written by someone WAY older than me with a lot of old-school ideas. Most of the things she says are your ""obligation"" and most of them sounded like things the bride would want to do herself anyway. Waste of money - but kind of funny to read it and think someone actually got a publisher to print this thing."
5,A very succinct primer!,"I think that Ms. Davis-Minik's book is an excellent EDI primer! It is very succinct, brief (in the best possible way) and easy to understand. The ten steps it ""sketches out"" to EDI success are valid deliverables for ANY EDI Project Plan. A very good value - I bought one for each of my team members. - Brian J. Cattle, Manager Inacom IT Sales & Solutions Architecture"
3,Nobody likes a show-off,"Intriguingly retro, a swell performance by Amy Warren on ""Paperback,"" more than competent musicianship and guest appearances by a bunch of cool people who don't seem to do much on the songs but provide solid ""name value"" endorsements. Excessively, exhaustingly literate, though. Hey, guys, the last song I heard with ""Rrose Selavy"" in the title was by Tiziana Simona. Who? Exactly."
4,Pulley,It works just like it is supposed to. It works just like it is supposed to. I reccommend this to everyone.
1,Don't Use 1-Click Ordering or Purchase Elsewhere,"Unfortunately, this review of this product has to get one star only because of Amazon.com's poor 1-Click Ordering. Granted I don't buy from Amazon.com frequently as I can find the same items from other online websites; however, I decided to purchase this product using 1-Click Ordering. Doing this, I was charged the Standard Shipping versus given a choice to select the free Super Saver shipping. I reviewed my options and I couldn't set the shipping settings to select Super Saver shipping. I call Amazon.com's customer service, and unfortunately and expectantly, absolutely nothing can be done for me as my order had been already shipped."
2,Bland,"Anyone familiar with the target range of Doctor Who novelizations will be very familiar with Terrance Dicks since he wrote so many adaptions in the range. You will also be familiar with the many criticisms of Dicks style. I`m afraid with DALEK INVASION OF EARTH these criticisms are justified.Terry Nation`s 1964 teleplay suffers from being wildly over-ambitious featuring devestated city landscapes , but unlike his adaption of DAY OF THE DALEKS Dicks fails to elaborate on this scenario just blandly skimming through the original script . For completists only"
4,Unknown Strauss at its Finest,"If you like Strauss, this little gem will keep you coming back for more. The waltzes Lava Steams, Patronesses and Publicists are amazing. You will hear some very familiar themes in the Rathausball-Tanze. This album also contains some other wonderful pieces - quadrille, polkas and a march. A truly good listen when you get tired of the old Strauss standbys."
1,If you like movies that make no sense........,"Very long ,very boring,and no pay off because I think they lost interest and forgot to make an ending.The movie stars Russ Tamblin (Satan's Sadists, West Side Story!). He's the only thing in the movie that makes it remotely entertaining by being the ""cheap laughs"" for this movie."
5,Fantastic,"Mike Lucas has definitely captured the essence of Camp Randall's history. Having been a Badger fan for the better part of three decades, I certainly think he did a terrific job of highlighting the great moments. Some may quibble over the order of the rankings. I personally think that the win over Michigan in '93 was the greatest moment, but in all, the book is fantastic.A must have for any Badger or Big Ten football fan. Golden Gopher fans not included, if there are such people."
4,It's better then a lot of the other's I've tried,"C++: A Beginner's Guide represents a very good introduction to the language. It hits all the major points, and as advertised in the introduction is a jumping off point for learning the language in detail. It doesn't stick to any one point in the language, but it does make sure to explain it in detail as well as use those parts of the language it's already covered in further applications. You'll have to work a little bit to learn the language from this book, and actually type it in the examples and do the exercises on your own. But it's a lot better then the junk guides already out there."
2,3D not ready for home TV Screens,"Quality of the film left a lot to be desired. However, I realize this is out of the seller's control. The film arrived in a timely manner and in New condition. Sorry for late submission of feedback."
2,Not enough Pictures,"Yes, even at the collegiate level, pictures are needed. The example problems rarely drew the diagrams/pictures. Also many of the problems refer back to previous examples in different chapters. For example, a problem in Ch 7 has us take the information for a problem in chapter 3; without a corresponding page number. Also the lay out of book is very compact. I wish the authors did not squeeze so much information on one page. The could have used more space, showed much more algebra steps, and MORE DIAGRAMS."
1,Terrible Textbook,"I had to get this book because it was required for my class, but this textbook really is terrible. There aren't a lot of examples, and much less examples that actually help with the homework. I wouldn't recommend this book unless you are forced to get it."
2,I didn't like it,"I usually keep all my textbooks, but I sold this one. My professor said this is one of the better probability textbooks out there, but his statement didn't change my mind at all.The problems are scattered throughout the reading and often refer to other previous problems (perhaps to save on printing costs). I did like the fact that later sections added upon previous homework problems, but since page numbers were never included, I found myself scouring the pages in search of the correct reference. Needless to say, it was frustrating.I think there are other problems with the book, but I hesitate to discuss them without looking at comparable textbooks. It is possible that this is one of the better probability books, but I didn't like it."
5,Elk hunting stories for those who love to hunt!,"If you love to hunt elk . . . whether you're a hunter or a huntress . . . you've just got to read this book. It's full of tips, fun and humor. Best yet, these are stories anyone can relate to. There are elk hunters and elk killers - Mike is an elk killer - with a great sense of humor. Enjoyed reading this several times!"
1,How to kill any child's love of mathematics,"This book, and the other Saxon books, are macabre specters from the educational Dark Ages. Please note that none of the reviewers recommending them are math educators. In the Saxon world, math is a set of mysterious numeric incantations that, followed by rote, produce a correct answer. (As if anyone cared.) There is not the slightest effort to explain WHY anything works, nor is there any discovery involved. In Saxon's world, math is something mysterious invented by people smarter than you, something that must be ""mastered"" by merciless drill. (So shut up and get to work.) The last 50 years of educational research on ""best practices"" math instruction simply do not exist in Saxon's world. Avoid these books at all cost -- unless, of course, you want American children to fall even farther behind their European and Asian counterparts."
5,Great! Easy to read giving the message of the 12 steps just for women,"This book helps learning the 12 steps from a women's point of view. Short, concise and thorough. Gave copies to my Sponcees and we have been working from it."
3,It's OK,"A different perspective than the original 12 step. Should be used as a supplement, not a replacement."
4,A Woman's Way through the Twelve Steps,"I felt I was a purist and that the only book to read and follow was the Big Book. While that book is very important in my recovery, I am learning that as the years have moved on and more women are in recovery, a new gender specific book is very enlightening and comforting. It has helped to fill in some gaps for me."
5,An essential Apollo Book,"There are a handful of books that are essential to understanding of how the successes of Apollo were achieved and about the people who made it happen. This is one of those books. ""Apollo EECOM"" is far more personal than most and is an easy, engrossing read. Above all, I appreciate Liebergot's honesty. Highly Recommended."
2,Missing the point of riding in TX,"I spent the past 20 years driving all over the state and looking for scenic rides and trips.This book is OK, but Dorothy missed the point of riding in this state. It's not taking the main roads (which are great for traveling at 60mph in a car), but finding the cool back roads that make motorcycling fun. One of the mecca's for bikers is the ""3-sisters"" ride in the Leakey, Campwood, Vanderpool area. This ride is not even mentioned in the book.If you really want to find the best riding, contact the local motorcycle groups in that area. I have found a number of great rides from joining other riders at the meetup website."
3,little out of date,"The book has great routes.However,when my husband and I rode a few of the routes many of the places mentioned in the book were closed. The routes are pretty but many of the stops no longer exist."
2,Problems,"It will adapt and allow you to put on lens, however the are several very serious problems. First of all it blocks part of the built in flash. Meaning if you use both it will leave a huge shadow across you picture. Sony recommends getting the slave flash, however you may wish to see the reviews of the slave flash before getting it also. Second you can't use the AF illuminator. Also you obviously have to use the LCD screen not the viewfinder. Finally it makes it unsteady on a tripod."
2,It's just funny not at more,Before i had listen to this album i was thinkin it was a lot of better he is not a good rapper for me nut it's ok for the commercial people ..
3,okay album,bizarre's cool but he could have did this with d12 but anyway you want rap qwith really bizarre lyrics pick up any cd by kokane plus check out cosmic slop shop come on I dare you.
4,R Restricted,"This is a solo album by D12's Bizarre and a most own if you like D12. My copy of this came with an R Restricted sticker and all the purverted and offensive lyrics certainly earned it. However this is not a bad album with great beats and a single ""Rockstar"" produced by Eminem. Bizarre is my second favourite D12 memeber my first being Eminem. This is a comedic album with funny adults only material. My favourite song would have to be I'm So Cool but the other songs I like are Intro, Gospel Weed Song, F*** Your Life, Let The Record Skip, Ghetto Music, Hip Hop, Rockstar, Doctor Doctor and some others that I can't think of right now. Skits are usually just stupid but I enjoy most of the skits on this.This is some good hip hop for ya if you like an other D12 album you won't be dissapointed with this."
4,Gift,"shipped quickly and size was true. A little stiff, but I'm sure that is just sizing and will wash out. Hopefully it doesn't shrink."
4,Poison live in concert,"Poison live in concert is the import version of Seven Days Live, exactly the same dvd with a different cover and title.Seven days Live first released on vhs in 1993 for the Native Tongue album, then finally released on dvd in 2003 as Poison live in concert with a new cover, and then re released again in 2006 with the original title and cover 'Seven Days Live'."
1,Strong Flavor,My husband and I didn't like this jerky. Tasted too strong and was salty. Smells powerful. It's not a product I would buy again.
1,Don't waste your time or money on this book,"I was sorely disappointed in reading this book. Instead of finding interesting stories which were well written, I found myself reading a book which seems like it had been written by a child in grade school. The silliness, and just the simplicity of its text makes the reader feel like an incompetent individual. Not to mention that these wives come off sounding like a bunch of ding-bats, for which I am sure they are not. I am wondering if after seeing the book in print, the wives are as sorry for participating in this book, as I am for actually taking the time to read it."
3,a little disappointing,"Although this book appears to be biographical fiction for kids, the fiction outweighs the history so heavily that I see very little value in it as a history teaching tool. As a story, the plot is moral and enjoyable enough (if a bit trite) and seemed appropriate for a 2nd or 3rd grader just getting into longer chapter books. If you are hoping to learn a lot about the real Wright brothers, though, look elsewhere."
1,Here we go again,"This is another attempt by a guy who always raps about being shot at and killing people and whatever but is still alive and making childrens films. Not really that hardcore huh. It is no suprise then, that we see, this guy pull yet another marketing scheme where he gets someone to lie, embellish and make up facts to make you think that ice-cube is a tough guy.I reckon he could sell ice-cubes to the eskimos. If you want to know about his life, I suggest you go to his mansion somewhere in Beverley Hills, ring his dora the explorer doorbell and have high tea with him out on the terrace.just cos he frowns a lot and makes up hardcore stories doesn't mean he lives it. He is an actor and is portraying a character to everyone and getting away with it.wake up everyone, this is what mcdonalds and politicians have been selling you all your life. Don't buy into it, take a stand today."
4,Gibson leather Task chair,"Excellent computer or desk chair. The best part is the lumbar support which gives great support. Also looks good (in black). It is manufactured in China, but then so is most everything these days. The seat is wider than most task chairs and is contoured for a comfortable seat as long as you are facing forward. The seat back is also wider than most task chairs and also gives good support. Overall, a really good value.The only downside is that the back does not tilt at all, so the chair does not allow you to lean back as is so common with many of these task chairs."
5,Inside Job - Well Done!,"Insightful, entertaining, slight on propaganda, yet fact based. Great story stelling and revealing. Paricularly telling interviews and opinions. Impressed with the interviews of current head of IMF Christine LaGarde. I watched it twice and have since given copies as gifts. It is a Wall Street run government. Many links to top government jobs and fund managers. Re-Exposes ratings agencies. Highly recommend!"
5,"Impressive, Thought-Provoking Motion Picture","My wife was so impressed and moved by this movie, she had to have a copy. We are extremely happy to have found one so easily."
5,Must see......more than once if you need to.,I have watched this movie every way offered. I watched the extra clips. I too wonder why the jails do not have some new guests living with them for a long time. Our banks that were supposed to serve the public abused the trust granted to them by the public and private sectors. It seems to always be about greed. I just watched waiting for superman and seems like the same thing. Greed. New laws will not fix this. The problems we face are far more fundamental and in the core of who we in the US we have become. Heaven help us with what judement is coming from all of this and what we have done to ourselves.
5,everyone in the world should read this,This is an explanation of the catastrophe that has taken place. It uncovers the crooks and gives warnings about misplaced trust and the times.
4,Great Inside Information,"Great movie. But it will make you wanna throw up or shoot some of the people who are getting away with what happend. It also shows how insignificant we really are in this real life monopoly game. I can only imagine how ""The Players"" on Wall Street just laugh at how they can control us and make tons of money off of the middle class with little to no oversight."
5,Inside Job,"This documentary takes it back to the beginning, covering a progression of events that help the regular person understand what happened and is happening in our country. It is a sad realization that we the ""little people"" struggle to pay our taxes and do the right thing, when the reality is that ""it"" is out of our control. What is fair about a $450 million dollar ""parachute"" and not pay ANY TAXES on it?? If I am one day late paying my payroll taxes, I am fined?? I plan on watching this movie several times, have loaned it to our friends. Unbelievable.This documentary is so very well done."
2,Boring and Very Dry,"I literally fell asleep watching thisunless u are into financial documentariesIt's dull, boring. Sure Matt Damon narrated - not enough Id rather watch Hereafter lol"
5,You need to watch this more than once. TMI,"This film is brilliantly narrated by Matt Damon, and spells out exactly what happened to bring us to our knees economically. The information comes at you so fast that you really need to watch it at least twice to fully appreciate it."
5,Inside Job,It was a very interesting Movie and made you aware of what was going on with banks and the entire Wall Street upheaval which put our country into the mess it is in now. Hopefully controls have been put in place so that something like this will never again happen in the United States.
2,worked great until it stopped working!,"I used this seat cushion for a couple months last summer (I live in Arizona, today it was 111F). When it got cooler, I took it out and put in my seat warmer for the winter. I just put this one back in about a month ago and it just stopped working two days ago. End of story. But, as hot as it gets here, I'm tempted to buy a new one when available because it does make a heck of a difference because of the evaporative cooling with the ""dry heat"" here in AZ."
2,Disappointing,"The book seems to be a rehash of other books and articals that have been published in the past ie; the section on waves on sandy beaches is just a rehash of Ken Abrams 1994 artical published in the Nov-Dec Flyfishing Mag. and alot of the rest of the book sounds like it came from Ken Abrams book Striper Moon that I just finished a few weeks ago. I think that book was out a few years ago.I was really expecting to get some new and Original Ideas and insight from someone who has been around for a while, not the reshuffling of someone elses' ideas and thoughts."
1,It didn't last...,"I have the Sunbeam Steam Master w/ Hot Iron Storage Strip Indicator that has the retractible cord... a slightly different model. I didn't find my exact iron on Amazon... What I *did* find is that other people experienced what I did, which it stops working after a short amount of time. I had mine 9 months and ironed only 3-4 shirts per week. One day it worked... the next day it would not heat up. I found a similar complaint on other sunbeam models reviewed here on Amazon and on-line when I googled my problem."
1,Poorly designed; continually leaks water,"I've had this iron for about two years. Everything works well except for one thing. And that one thing is a huge problem. Water continually splashes out through the water door onto whatever you're ironing. I've made sure the water door is closed tightly and that the gasket for the door is in its proper place. But there is nothing I can do to stop the leaking. The problem appears to be in the iron's design. The water door is too low on the iron. It's down where the water inside is going to be splashing around. Because of where the door is, the water inside the iron easily finds the water door and leaks out. The opening should be moved back towards the top of the iron so that it's much higher than the water level - both when the iron is standing and when it's in use. Aside from this one very annoying issue, the iron has worked well."
2,cannot use compression connectors,Coax cable appears to be of great quality but I normally use compression type connectors and the diameter of the cable is slightly too large to use them.
5,A whopping good time!,"An in depth collection of esoteric essays from the early 20th century. Subjects covered include meditation, drugs, veiled references to ritual sex, yoga, art, literature, magickal history, current (early 20th century) occult topics. The literary reviews are hilarious, if you are familiar with the subject. The advertisments in the back are fascinating."
1,disappointed and covered in blemishes,"I'm 25. I bought this because it was suppose to help clear up my skin, and give me a better complexion.... The first day I used it, I loved the result.... I used it for a week, and then I broke out like crazy. I had also switched my face wash at the same time, so I continued to use both for another couple weeks. Then I switched my face wash back to my old one.... still no improvement, just kept getting worse.... I blame Pur Minerals foundation for the worst acne I've ever! I have never had so many little whiteheads in my life! So bummed out.Going to try out Bare Escentuals now."
4,Pretty good make up,"Brush is rough on face - okay if you use it gently. Pictures on Amazon.com have Golden Medium and Light switched so I ordered the wrong color. Emailed company within the hour to try and make the change, but never received a response."
4,Trailer Groom For A Trailer Bride,"This Cd is littered with well written ""sapphire gems."" Music Neko Case wishes she could write. Honest songs without pretense and genuinely Southern. Live, the band is engaging and Melissa Swingle is like an apparition/ghostly captivating spirit. The bassist has personality and plays standup with soul. Glad I discovered these guys at Sleazefest 2000! This beats Gillian Welch and the rest with a Louisville Slugger. Enjoy."
3,Singer Songwriter= great. Rest of band= lousy,"The singing and songwriting are great. Very unique without consciously trying to be ""different"". A genuine unique voice. However!!, this ""band"" is not even passable. They sound as (in) competent as kids when they are first learning their instruments at say 12 -13 years old. Truly, it is unfortunate, the songs are great and I believe this band could be succesful, but the bass licks and drumming in particular are atrocious. they are not even in time , there is simply no coherence or ""pop"" when they need it. no consistency. they sound like they just picked up instruments to be in a band... sad for a very promising lead singer/songwriter..get a REAL band!!"
5,A Visual Feast,In my opinion this is the most beautiful acoustic-electric guitar made (including Ovation's own SE model). People rave about the stunning grain of the koa. Sounds good unplugged. Sounds absolutely amazing through the amp. I play a finger-picking/strumming Jimmy Buffett-style and believe that this is the perfect guitar for me. Ask someone at Sam Ash or Guitar Center or Musician's Friend. It is available through these retailers even if it is hard to find it on their websites. I expect to be playing this guitar until my fingers stop listening to my brain. I totally love it.
5,Perfect.,"These were a great detail and much cheaper than buying them through Shure. We wear our headsets for working out, so it's nice to have some backup pads."
2,E-Z Reader not so easy,"I'm trying to help an adult learn to read, but the books I've bought are not basic enough & neither is the vocabulary. I need a Pre-EZ Reader."
5,"Fireflies, honey sweet humid nights, and bluegrass","I first heard the Seldom Scene in an open air concert in rural West Virginia in 1973, a stone's throw from the C&O canal, and their music is never far away from me.This was, I believe, this first album and the music never grows old -- always fresh, bright, and crisp. Unlike some of their other albums, this is an marred by the caprice of exuberant concert goers competing with the musicians.Makes you want to sing, dance, hum, and even do house work with a smile.I was never a ""Dead Head"" but I became a ""Scene Head"" and if you get this album you might understand why."
5,Best Photo-History of Abraham Lincoln's Assassination,"This book has hundreds of photographs related to AbrahamLincoln's assassination and funeral train. Its writtendescription of events from April 14, 1865, to May 4, 1865,is outstanding. This book is by far the best of its kind."
5,Great solo piano,If you like piano this is a great addition to your collection. If you have never listened to solo piano this is a good CD to start with. But don't go overboard with Sandy Owen. Not all her CD's are as beautiful as this one.
5,Very touching and moving!,"I read this book in about a day and a half, which is really fast for me! It is a very intense, deeply emotional book that, though it is fiction, deals with the very tough issue of grief. When I wasn't crying, I was laughing. The author did a really good job weaving the present with the past. The main character, Caleb, would recall many of his happy memories with his wife, Tiffany, through the entire book. It was the memories that had me laughing. I really did thoroughly enjoy this book. I've read everything that this relatively new author has written and let me tell you, she has grown immensely in her writing ability and in her spirituality.My favorite part of the book was at the end. It had to do with an interaction between Caleb and his son, Simon. But I don't want to give anything away. So, get the book, read it and then I'm sure you'll agree that the part at the end (and the entire book for that matter) is really good."
3,"the first cd was scratched, and one of the fights wouldn't play.","it was a good buy, but one of the bouts in 47 wouldn't play, on my computer, a dvd player, or a ps2. frustrating, but I'm over it."
2,Annoying...,"I have read a lot of romance novels and some of them can be pretty unbelievable but this one is outright ANNOYING. Rosalia must be the stupidest, dense, woman I have ever read about. Nobody is that stupid. I know that the love for her child angle is important but the dialogue was so unbearable. I felt like hitting her in the head. Too bad coz Damian's character could have been brilliant. THis could have been written with the same plot but the author could have tone down the woman's stubborness."
3,Bandit's Moon,"The book I am reviewing is Bandit's Moon, by Sid Fleischman. It was an ""ok"" kind of book. My favorite part was when Annyrose found Lank, her long lost brother. That was my favorite part because that was the most exciting event that happened in the story. I would recommend it to someone who likes a good mystery and an exciting story. Find out what happened to Annyrose and Lank in Bandits Moon and read this story!"
3,"Good start, but needs pictures and an editor!","If you don't mind wading through typographical errors, this is a good informational book about building a house from top to bottom. If you are planning on building or subcontracting your own house, this will not be enough, however. The book is lacking in actual photos; all illustrations are line drawings. The book does not *appear* to be worth the price paid for it. An editor, a higher grade of paper, and some photos would make this a really good resource, and would probably make this a much better selling book for the author as well. The most valuable lesson Mr. Jaeger tries to get across is caveat emptor, (""buyer beware"") but I learned that for free years ago on the Brady Bunch."
4,Getting started...and beyond?,"Yip, worth the pennies you're going to spend on it. It has a no-nonsense approach and gets you up and running in no time at all. It doesn't include the typical html-this-and-html-that intro chapters (that are included in virtually all the other web development-related books) and jumps away with the cardinals immediately.It is obviously not a topical alpha-to-omega subject matter type of book - for this buy separate titles specialising in the Macromedia component you're interested in.But if you are a hit-the-ground-running type of being, this will show you how all the Macromedia components integrate with each other and beyond. The book is definitely worth the odd 8550 square millimeters (footprint that is!) on your bookshelf. Enjoy!"
4,Somewhat Pleased,"This is a good teaching book and in general I believe it gave me a good foundation from which to work from. However, the reader should be aware that there seems to be a few code examples that just don't work. Whether its syntax or operator error, it distracts you from your learning curve."
2,Not for beginners as the title suggests,"If given the opportunity, I would have Mr. Cornell go back and make the entire manual flow like the first six chapters. I was fairly confident as I waded through those first chapters because the author proceeded slowly and explained everything. Then, all of a sudden, it seemed like a different writer took over.The book is also extremely wordy. Not a good attribute for a manual like this. I think the people using this manual want to find information fast and read it fast. Instead, you have to wade through miles and miles of verbage to pick out what you need.There are also too many tips, notes, and cautions. They get in the way. As a reader, you start ignoring them after awhile.Mr. Cornell is obviously very knowledgeable. He provides lots of helpful hints to improve efficiency. This is just not an appropriate book for beginners."
2,How many errors could possibly be in one book.,I'm almost completed with this book and although it helped me in learning VB I am disgusted with the amount of errors and typos in this book. The website of the publisher www.osborne.com claims to post the errors. I went there and found two corrections while there should have been an entire web page to list all of them. Gary Cornell needs to go back to grammer school and learn how to proof read. Computer books are not cheap and while some errors are acceptable this is a disgrace.
5,Truly awesome,I haven't programmed much and I bought this book because it seemed to assume nothing but was thick enough so that I figured it would cover a lot. So far I haven't been disappointed!
5,Fabulous for a novice in VB.,"My professor recommended this book as a tool to have when you need to refresh your mind with the basics of VB. It proves the above. Also, bought it used, excellent condition, like new. Thanks JM."
2,Utterly Nonsense.,"If you bought this book because it is written by co-author of the classic Core-Visual basic, you would be utterly disappointed. While it may be good for a novoice, if you are experienced VB programmer this book is a useless stuff."
4,Too wordy,"Basically, it is a good book. Clearly teachs the Visual Basic programming. However, the author usually does not hit the key points right the way, instead, hides the key points in huge paragraphs. It wasted a lot of my time to read this wordy book. I believe if the author could remove the unnecessary words, he can cut the size of the book by half and make this book even better."
3,Not the Composer's Strongest Work,"DO YOU BE is a rather puzzling and frustrating CD. Apart form her other works this collection of works emphasizes more the piano than the voice. Whereas in most of her better known works Monks facile use of the voice as an instrument, in this collection the voice seems to be obbligato to the chords of piano music. The pieces here are for 10 voices, 2 pianos, synthesizer, violin & bagpipes and while they continue to fascinate and substantiate Monk's position in the avant-garde realm, they can become wearing. Rhythms are important here and take a focus not heard in Monk's other music. The performers are all first rate musicians and their virtuosity shows! A collector's item more than a CD, the owner will likely not be listening to or experiencing repeatedly. Grady Harp. May 10"
4,Good book!,"This book is a little long, but I appreciated its content. It makes sense, works hard to communicate a way of thought, not just a system, and pretty straight-forward.It could have probably been trimmed to 2/3 of what it is, but it's still a good read."
5,The Strauss Brothers collaborate.,"Of special interest in Volume 44 of this massive edition are three works produced in collaboration by the Strauss Brothers. Three of them are quadrilles, and the best of them - the Sch√ºtzen-Quadrille - was jointly composed by all three brothers, Johann, Josef and Eduard. Conveniently, the quadrilles (as danced in Vienna) comprised six short pieces, so each brother contributed two apiece. Before reading the liner notes, listeners should try to guess who contributed what. Christian Pollack is the conductor here, directing rarely performed works, and the sound quality is excellent."
3,Incomplete book,"I just graduated from college and I am getting ready to start my new job as an analyst/programmer. I bought this book to help review and remember different techniques for visual basic.net. This book as some good examples, however, this book lacks the complete code to make different examples work. There are subroutines missing from examples as early as Chapter 1. This could be a valuable book if all the code was included."
5,Addictive music,I love all the chants. The last song in English is a little boring. My partner and I listen to the chants so much we dream about them. It's addicting. I love Tina Malia. The harmonies blend very well. I would like to see more of the Sanskrit songs.
3,not a bad short story.,I would have never heard about this unless I went to colege. It details in a different viewpoint the style of French Revolution happenings
5,Nice!,"From the picture I was worried that it would turn out to be a cheap tin cup, but it is really very good.Thick metal, strong welds, great polish. Excellent."
3,Stainless steel frothing pitcher,While this is a quality made product and I like it I was truly disappointed in the very small size it actually turned out to be.
5,Good Value,"Exactly what you see, no frills, gets the job done! Construction is solid, finish is nice. Not much else to say"
4,Perfect size to froth my milk!,"Froths milk very easily and tall enough to not spill in the process. Be careful to hold only the handle because the metal gets very hot while frothing. If you need to froth for more than 2 people, I suggest a bigger frothing pitcher so your not frothing over and over. Great quality too!"
2,Frothing Pitchers,"I bought these for myself to use with my Expresso machine and froth up the milk, but I have found I have not used them yet and I bought them months ago. They just sit in my cabinet. I use my cup I am going to drink my mocha in to froth up the milk. So even though they are nice they have never been used. Maybe some day I will find some kind of use for them."
4,"Possibly mistitled, but still a good read","This book seems to be more about personality than actual snooping (I wonder what it says about me that I want to read a book about snooping?), but it is an interesting read.The author doesn't really get into the snooping until the end, and basically he says that you can find out more about a person by asking about their stuff (ex: Why did you pick that username? Why do you have a picture of someone else's puppy up at your desk?). There is usually a story that will come of those questions."
2,Not a good read,I did not purchase this book. I checked it out at the library. I thought it would be interesting and give tips on what our possessions say about us as people. It was almost useless for this purpose. Almost everything in this book is common sense with no big revelations at all. I do not recommend it.
3,mildly interesting.,"Overall, decent, but not great. It was a good introduction to personality psychology, i feel, but less content about what people's stuff says about them (or, less than i expected) and how to analyze people.For anyone with a bit of intuitive sense on people and psychology many things in this book might seem obvious. Still, some good points, just... not as good as i was expecting."
2,Good for Kids.,"Not very scientific, well-- not at all scientific.It is good for children and beginners as a *stage act* inspiration. Book is big on anecdotes about performance hypnotism acts, not much down-to-earth practical instruction on actually *how too do* real serious hypnosis.Very basic ""entertainment hypnotism"" that a young adolescent student will like.Like a few other reviewers, I just couldn't see a reason to rave over this book. My middle school daughter did like it though, and she also likes books on basic stage magic.If you are looking for motivational literature on getting together a career of hypnotizing people at parties or events, this book might motivate you. I just don't think it will inform in any detail *how too*."
3,A little boring....,"Hi my name is Ava. I am ten years old and I am going to review the video journal. The camera is plastic with a little metal square, and it looks really weird with all these little holes and bolts sticking out [on the back]. WARNING! THIS DOES NOT WORK ON APPLE MACBOOK COMPUTERS!!!!!!!!! YOU NEED WINDOWS!!!!!!! The camera doesn't even work on windows!!!!!! Sure, it has lots of activites, but only half of them are fun. For example: they give you a whole paragraph to write about your favorite teacher! What a school assignment!!!!!!! Some of them are fun, MOST OF IT IS NNOOOTTT!!!!!"
4,Beginner's Digital Camera for the young,"Great for young 1st time camera user. Small enough to fit in a young girl's purse. Comes with great software. Cons: must have a very steady hand. Can't preview picture, no preview window. For the price, it'a a good starter digital camera."
1,Waste of money,"I bought it as a christmas present and we used it the same night, the software is weird and difficult even for me, my little girl didn't play with it again... she was so excited to have her own camera but in less than one week she forgot about it. Waste of money."
1,"""Video Journal"" Not Girl Tech Video Journal...for boys...NOT","I purchased this item for grandkids...no problem for the teen girls with the Girl Tech Video Journal.BUT, the ones I bought for the boys was just labeled Video Journal and what they got was Girl Tech. What is up with that. You know the boys would love to use it and make picture on the computer to share or not share, but will they use it if it is labeled Girl Tech Video Journal? NOT. Totally not described properly. Not what do we do. A very unhappy grandmother of 11 kids."
2,Great idea but the software is horrible.,"The is a classic example of a great idea with horrible implementation. The software for this product is awful. It does not even work unless you usean account on your Windows computer with Administrator privileges. Of course, I don't want my daughter using such an account on our computer.Secondly, the software itself has many issues. It often cannot find the camera even though it is connected. I have to reconnect it. Certain buttonsand prompts that the manual says should appear, do not appear. Examples of these are the ""save"" button for loading the pictures from the camera and the password prompt for returning from ""Hide"" mode.This product has, however, inspired me to find higher quality products like it."
1,Pathetic,"A person cold bloodedly chases down her children, one by one. Holdsthem down in a bathtub while they fight for their lives, again one byone. She gets sympathy from the author. Sad. Whats with this rash of""poor pitiful murderer"" books coming out lately?"
3,Watkins Petro-Carbo Salve,"An elderly friend recommended this product to me, telling me it's the same salve her parents used on her to help heal injuries more quickly. I decided to try it and it does work, however, it's a petro(leum) jelly with a distinct color and a little odor (almost like Vick's vapor rub), so I think I'd still prefer Neosporin for childrens' minor cuts and scrapes."
3,Coulda Been a Lot Better,"My wife bought this for me, It was alright, but it had no menu, no extras. It would have been better if there'd been back stories to some of the moments, or full length versions of some of the moments. There were some ""classic"" moments that had me yawning, simply because I didn't find them that funny the first time they'd aired. There were times that I was wondering what was going on. There's a segment dedicated to DX, but DX appeard throughout the entire DVD, the same with other people. Don't get me wrong, but it left a lot to be desired."
2,MISSED ALOT OF STUFF,"THIS DVD HAD SOME FUNNY THINGS IN IT,BUT IT COULD HAVE BEEN ALOT BETTER. THEY ALSO CUT EVERYTHING SHORT."
5,Powerful Writing,"This short novel by Andrew Holleran is an emotionally intense first-person narrative of a man coming to grip with the emptiness of his life and his sheltered, withdrawn existence. The narrative that follows the storyteller's life through about a six month period gives a stark portrayal of what (unfortunately) many single, middle-aged, gay men face...a gradual withdrawing from social interactions, crippling aloneness and the walls they build around themselves to protect them.Highly recommend reading this book if you or someone you know is slipping into mid life. I believe you will find Holleran's approach to this novel fascinating. We never learn the name of any of the characters, except for the narrator's friend, who is the only one that seems to have a well adjusted view of his life.This is an excellent selection for a book club or reading group."
2,It's not grief.,I am an aging gay man. I have lost both my parents and have buried two lovers. I know well what grief is--and this is not it.
2,Felt GRIEF after reading this book,"I bought this book based on the feedback of others on Amazon. I was rather excited to read it once I received the book. Although, this book is written extremely well, I found this book rather uninteresting, slow, and anticlimactic. The author incorporates the letters of Mary Todd Lincoln into the story, which is interesting. To be honest the most interesting character in this book is the dog. This book has a lot of potential. There was just no story-line, no plot. If you want to truly experience a sense of grief, read this book. But I am human and maybe I missed something that others did not."
5,Don't miss this wonderful book!,"""You must buy this book! No romance I've read in years can match it for emotion, for provoking immediate response. None brings characters so immediately to life. Richness, depth, triumph of the human spirit over adversity, irresistible people--all with a touch of EVER AFTER. Gypsies and faeries fill the smoke of the vividly drawn historical backdrop. From the first spellbinding pages, you'll feel those small prickles of awareness that remind you these are human beings and their plight matters; they must win that most precious gift of healing--love."" --Award-winning, bestselling author of The Midwives series, Margot Early"
4,A rare example of TSR's very early work,"""Undead"" is certainly a surprising find at Amazon. It is quite literally a relic from the early days of role-playing. Within is described a campaign setting of Verdaise (a volcanic land populated largely by various undead creatures) and several other rather useful tidbits like undead combat tactics and several variant species. Although I cannot say that this is one of TSR's best works, the material presented herein is so original and so much unlike anything TSR is currently publishing that it almost certainly deserves a look from the gamer (besides being a rather collectible item)."
1,What a junk!,I regret I didn't trust review from others and actually bought this kit! I was very excited to try it first but within 20 minutes felt completely frustrated. Save your money and buy anything else!
1,Ambivalent,"Although written by a doctor, too many sections of the book have virtually zero medical research or data to support their simple-minded advice. The entire enterprise is superficial, condescending, flippantly fatuous, and rather diffident to normal intelligent discussion. In fact, the book is a shocking affront to knowledge in the 21st century.A main point seems to be that parents shouldn't worry and that nature will see your baby through any difficulties in breastfeeding. Along the way, Dr. Cohen insults lactation consultants, many of whom apparently know the medical research much better than he, and he smuggles in caricatures of women as supportive but unknowing handholders.While the reader's intelligence is constantly insulted by the spare, condescending tone from cover to cover, the book also poses a potential danger to people who know very little and need help for a serious problem, particularly in breastfeeding."
4,So liberating!,"We may not agree with everything that the book says but we love how liberating it is! It makes you feel like it is okay to not be a helicopter parent and make a big deal over every little thing that is going with your child. It also busts some commonly held myths and gives you real information. Love the format, still readable as a book but useful when you want the information quickly and you can just look it up alphabetically. It is a little outdated (I wonder if they will come out with a new addition), but only in a couple of areas like saying that vaccines protect from eradicated diseases, however we know that whopping cough has made a comeback in some places because people stopped vaccinating for it."
2,Too Basic,"This book sets forth a variety of topics in alphabetical order. For instance, if your child has a rash, you can look up rash and there will be a small blurb on it. I would have preferred a book that discussed things in a developmental time line. I was trying to figure out what things I can expect my daughter to do at this stage in her life and the book just wasn't set out that way. Also, I thought some of the advice was just too basic. Even as a first time mother, I already had read all the advice the author gave in other books or had learned the information through word of mouth. But if you want an alphabetical, dictionary-type book, then it was easy to read and understand and might be helpful."
1,not for windows vista 64 bit,"this adapter does not work with windows vista 64 bit. dont waste your time and money like i did. i was trying to get it to work for about 6 hours and had to do a system restore because it started to mess up. but with windows vista 32 bit it might work, im not sure and with windows XP, people say its super easy to install. but for windows vista 64 bit, nope dont even try. dont buy it if you have a 64 bit. trust me. and that goes for all the planex adapters."
1,Horrible device,"I did NOT like the crap this device put me thorough. It fights with my current wireless adapter that I used for my computer's internet. It just is not user friendly whatsoever and trying to get the computer to recognize the device is like pulling teeth. Windows refused to recognize the device even after the drivers were installed and I have to force windows to take those. Had to play ""Which usb slot"" because none of the 8 that's on my computer recognized it twice in a row... More than a headache, it's an ulcer. DOES NOT WORK WITH XLINK KAI!"
3,Average laptop,"I purchased this notebook around 2 years back. Overall the performance is good. As mentioned by other reviewer, the battery life is very poor. You can not do multitasking, the performance becomes slow. I don't like the screen as well. It doesn't have the wide, xbrite screen and you can not watch movies in group.I think I like the most is the the dvd burning capacity. I have copied many dvds without any problem.Overall its OK laptop."
4,I Know Where I'm Going,"I Know where I'm Going is an all-time great. However, I cannot play it on my TV screen, I guess because it is (Region 2). I have not tried it on my computer yet but am hoping it will work. My review is based on the Netflix rental which was returned.This movie has great story and cast."
4,The Ocean Between us-Great story,"I just finished reading this on my Kindle last night: this is a wonderful story of life. The wife and family constantly saying good bye to a loved one in the service,then the hoping and praying for their healthy safe return, while trying to cope with everyday life at home. This book really looks at the family and their lives things that happen and also the men and women away fighting or training, and their lives. So much for you to relate to. Wonderful characters Even if you don't read the (very short) prequel this is a nice story. My first Susan Wiggs stories ( prequel and this book) and I will read more of her work."
5,Captures military life and the beautiful Pacific NW,"When I read this, I thought, ""she must be a military spouse...she has captured how we feel."" Since I am a military spouse and author, I contacted her, wanting to make connection. Turns out she isn't a military spouse, and never has been. Which just goes to show how much research this novelist puts into her books.As someone who has lived in the NW and a long time lover of lakes, I loved the setting as well. Whether you are military or not, if you've ever faced a time period of doubt in your life about your choices and life direction, you'll relate. A great summer read! Kathie Hightower, coauthor of Help! I'm a Military Spouse...I Get a Life Too!"
3,The Ocean Between Us,Not one of my favorites by Susan Wiggs. I took this book to the beach hoping to enjoy it while relaxing on the sand but the book was boring and didn't hold my interest. Finished it but not fast enough!
5,at last a dog hero with a real job,"A dog in the story is no longer a ""gimmick"". Conant has presented a dog serving a real purpose, and the usefullness of this task is an integral part of the story. I have passed on copies of this book it is so relevant, and a darned good read, too"
5,Tour de Force,"An astonishing accomplishment by the man who more or less invented the field of DSMC calculation. Includes a handy-dandy disk (with source) so you can run you own problem with a variety of different boundary conditions. See also Bird 1973, Phys Fluids, v16 pp1830-1834."
5,Gone to Texas,"Sam Elliott plays Sam Houston. A very important person in the founding of the State of Texas. This movie covers the beginings of Houston's relationship to Texas and the importance of the historical figure. Where many movies were made about the fall of the Alamo, this movie only referrs to it as a footnote. This movie gives a much better basic history lesson. I would compare it to ""TORA-TORA-TORA"" and ""Pearl Harbor."" ""Pearl Harbor"" was more entertaining, but ""TORA-TORA-TORA"" gave more of the history of the events."
1,"POOR, POOR, and POOR","Badly filmed, badly written, and the editing was beyond bad. Sam Elliot should be ashamed of himself for getting involved with this turkey. Do yourself a big favor pass on this one."
3,Erratic operation and missing stand,"The Aluratek port works erratically. Manually switching between two computers does not always work properly, and sometimes I just unplug the cord from the computer that I can't switch to and just replug it directly into the printer. The auto switching does not work at all, so I'm not sure what that ""auto"" light means. Also, upon seeing the photo of the Aluratek on Amazon's request for me to write this review, I now realize that a stand was supposed to have come with this. After I finish this review, I'm writing Amazon to see why I did not receive the stand. So,in summary,the switch works about 75% of the time, the other 25% I have to unplug and replug as described above. My two computers are an older Dell and Apple."
2,Unfortunately the title is the best part,"I admit I bought this book because the title was catchy and the story description sounded interesting. The name the author uses is interesting as well, if it's real. That said, it turns out that the title actually is the best thing about the book.I'm truly sorry that the book didn't live up to it's description. Had it, we would have had an interesting story that addressed a problem of importance to gay people - alcoholism.Alcoholism and ""bar culture"" are largely the byproduct of gay culture's historical emphasis on bars and nightclubs - that's been well discussed elsewhere. It's also the simple conceit that is used as the underlying subject of this book. Unfortunately, it fails. Spectacularly, I'm sorry to say."
2,Hmmmmm .............,Ear piece is very uncomfortable. Haven't tried it yet. Case is just for carrying the phone - you have to take the phone out to use it. Haven't tried the car charge either.Price is cheap enough even if the car charger is the only useful item in this bundle.
5,An easy to read solid account of the Battle of Shiloh,"McDonough's work on Shiloh is an easy to read, solid account of the battle. His book is indepth enough to allow a good understanding of what took place and why but not overpowering with details that often make accounts of battles uninteresting. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants a good general understanding of the overall battle and the events thereof."
1,Would have been great,"Very comfortable headphones, the noise cancelations was excellent, but the sound quality was terrible. I've had $30 headphones that were much better than these. Sound was low and dull. Maybe I just got a bad pair. I returned them and went with Bose. The Bose headphone quality was far superior and also far more expensive at $300. But I am very happy with the purchase."
4,Great headphones!,"I purchased these headphones about a month ago and so far they've worked out great! I got these because I share an office at work and needed something to cancel out the noise. They work great and I haven't experienced any of the problems that people have reported here. Just make sure you have some spare AAA batteries with you because the life doesn't last all that long. But even without the canceling turned on, they still keep it pretty quiet. I've been on a few flights with them and they work great there to. To me they seemed just as good as the Bose, but half the price.Best Buy has them in their store, so you can always hop over there to check them out for yourself (that's what I did). Although Best Buy wouldn't give me the Amazon price, so I bought them here! Stupid Best Buy."
4,"Don't Turn, Turn, Turn.","I have to say, these headphones are super comfortable, and sound great. However, one little quirk - it seems when I turn my head (say I'm resting on the plane and turn one way or the other) I start to notice the throbbing, noise-canceling pulse, and it's pretty darn annoying. Maybe I'm just missing something - but I couldn't figure out how to remedy this. But, for me, not worth replacing, because they are otherwise superb headphones, and I can keep my head forward if necessary."
4,Sony MDR-NC60 Work for Me,"I am planning on a long trip to Hawaii and back, along with flights to the west coast. So, I needed to buy a pair of noise cancellation headphones for long trip to listen to music and watch some movies on my iPod. I looked and tested several. Needless to say you can spend a lot of money on this item. However, I think that the Sony MDR-NC60 will do the job to my satisfaction without getting into paying a ridiculous amount of money for something you are not going to us all the time. The one brand which I am sure you all know of is truly to top of the line, but just not worth the money they are asking you to pay. You are paying a lot for their name.I also found that buying them on Amazon saved me over $60.00 from the store price at a local well known retailer. I do a lot of shopping on Amazon and have always been able to find the products I want at a reasonable price."
1,18 Months of light use - Now in for Exchange,"I purchased these headphones in August 2009 and only use them for airline travel (infrequent). Now there is a very audible clicking noise coming from the left earpiece. Of course, I'm out of warranty and must spend another $80 for an exchange from Sony."
3,So-So,The sound quality is acceptable but I can't have the noise canceling enabled for more than thirty seconds without having the headphones blast my ears with static and distortion.
1,"Great Noise Protection: Get the Warranty, you'll need it","I bought the Sony MDR-NC60 because I really liked the sound quality and noise cancelling, and found it extremely effective for at least 2 years of continuous daily use in my noisy office.The problem is that the plastic swivel that connects the headphones to the headband is poorly designed, and has now cracked, making the headphones useless and uncomfortable. This resulted from normal wear and tear - I would not recommend these to anyone. For several hundred dollars, Sony could afford to put a metal swivel in - a genuinely poor judgement call in the engineering department."
1,Horrible Resonance!,"Yes these headphones do have a horrible low frequency resonation that occurs when noise cancellation is activated. It would worsen if I tilted my head forward, but was present all the time. Very disappointing, was there no quality control during the production of these."
2,Excellent...except for the vibration,"Experienced the same vibration problem as others, mine in the left ear. For me, it happened in moderately noisy environment. I was able to situate myself such that the vibration went away, but I find it unacceptable to have to do that with $150 headphones.Other than that, the sound and comfort were very good, passive noise cancellation was excellent, and active noise cancellation was very good as well. It's unfortunate that the vibration was so noticeable, as these are excellent headphones otherwise.I returned these and bought the Audio-Technica ATH-ANC7 and am very happy with those."
2,MDR-NC60 Doesn't Cancel Noise well,"I had a pair of Maxell MAX190400 noise canceling headphones that broke. Instead of replacing them I thought I would try other noise canceling headphones. I bought (and returned) the following: Shure SE210, Sony MDR-NC60, and the Phillips headphones from Best Buy.The noise canceling on the Sony headphones is terrible. I work in an office that plays music that I don't like. I didn't expect total silence when wearing the Sony's, but the sound should be significantly decreased. However, I heard everything even though the NC feature was turned on. I just bought Maxell's HP/NCIV and they work much better and block out almost all noise. Don't waste your money and time with the Sony. If you really want noise cancellation get the Maxell."
2,Useful but amateurish,"The format of a chronological description of major dates in the psychedelic ""time-line"" is fine but this book suffers from total absence of editing, including spell-check, and originality! Duh, ""heroine"" for ""heroin,"" ""David Gilmore"" for ""David Gilmour"" are just a few obvious flubs. Now and then the author interjects into the descriptive chronology the odd value judgement when it concerns his own fave-raves. The final section, a short review-list of major and minor psychedelic bands, is lifted from better books, like Joynson, etc. In short, this is for the undemanding reader."
5,Wonderful book,I have purchased many books on pet care. I honestly think this is one of the best I have ever had. It is filled with ideas to help your pet in a natural way....its a must have for any dog owner.
3,Good supplemental to other manuals,"I did keep this book in order to have a variety in my library. Many common sense remedies, however, if you are a first time pet owner, this book would be great."
1,"The movie itself gets a ""5,"" but the shoddy dvd gets a ""-5""!","Jesus H., man! I thought I was gonna go cross-eyed trying to make out what the hell was going on with the picture quality... and I use the phrase quite liberally. It was like watching scrambled pr0n! I'd recommend it if you cannot get a good vhs dupe from the 80s. Laguna Films needs to get better sources for their movies."
5,Great set of drills,6 bits could be sold separate but thats marketing. Very pretty wood box they come in but a plastic pouch would serve as well and be more cost effective. The carbide drills will easily penetrate the super tough stuff!
1,Not a good buy,I bought this drill set. It was not as strong as the manufacturer stated. The wood box is made from some cheap material which broke easily. I wouldn't recommed this product to users who prefer quality and durability.
1,Looks like a self published vanity book,I read this book and found it to be hard to follow and understand. The writing style varies from page to page as if more than one Author worked on it. In my opinion... Not exactly anything someone would want to use as a guide for starting a new business.
4,Entrepenuers-this book will save you time and money,"This book combines the true story of a start-up robotics company with concise rules for recognizing and dealing with risk in a start-up business. This book will save an individual planning on starting a business hours and hours of ""learning"" time and well as much money. Very few books talk about a business that ultimately failed while incorporating all the lessons the author learned along the way."
1,FALL-APART RIPPOFF,"CLASP IS GLUED TO LEATHER AND PULLED APPART WHEN TRYING TO RELEASE THE CLASP. CLASP IS AFIXED TO LEATHE BY 1/4 INCH. NO RESPONCE FROM COMPANY, NO REPLACEMENT , NO REFUND. IF YOU HAVE TO HAVE IT. FORGET THE CLASP (NOT SILVER) ORDER LARGER SIZE AND TIE A KNOT IN IT !!!"
1,Kenda K841 kontact tire 20x1.95,"The worst tire i have ever seen. Looked great and seemed to perform ok as brand new--within 1 week tire was worn through in multiple spots from loose dirt riding only, with some brake lock-up but not extreme skidding and never on hardpack or road. Was so bad that within the next week the tube burst through the worn area. Lasted a total of <2wks on my 11 yr olds redline bike.Would not recommend to anyone except the person who only uses tires once/1 ride and then replaces.The worst tire you could possibly spend your money on!! Total Garbage."
3,somewhat disappointing.....,I'm a big Brian Wilson fan and was expecting a mix of better performances. Please understand that I am typically not very fussy but this was a let down for me. Probably explains its low price tag.
5,Fall in Love,"Even though I fell in love with Blind Melon long ago, Letters rekindled the flame and made me remember just exactly how wonderful their music is. This is the finest tribute to Shannon. This video is magnetic, and Shannon's beauty is hard to ignore. I especially love that Letters highlights the music, the closely-knit love in the band and the magic of Shannon's presence and the glory of his life; not his addiction. That's just a sad footnote."
4,OH I love SEVENDUST so much,So I love this Band they are totaly UNDER RATE and should be more known than what they are. I went from being a R &B girl to being a full time SEVENDUST FAN and now turned into a heavey mental/rock fan. This CD is cool it shows some concert footage and shows them in inteverviews it's real cool wish there was a little bit more on it. Other than that perfect and I LOVE SEVENDUST and will always buy there products on here.
4,It repeated itself,"This DVD isnt as good as others out their. I am a big Sevendust fan but this wasnt a great buy. It gets a 4 only because i love Sevendust. I felt like it focused to much on their first album and not enough on the second, and barely mentioned ""Animosity'. Also it runs at over 3 hours, but they repeat themselves and show the same footage twice. If you really like their first album then you will love this DVD. If you dont care much for the first album and only like 'Home' then this isnt for you."
4,GREAT DISC,"THE SONGS ARE REALLY GOOD LIKE ""SPIRIT NEVER DIE"" AND MY FAVORITE ""CRYSTAL NIGHT"", JORN LANDE HAVE A GREAT VOICE IS VERY GOOD."
3,It's ok,"I guess it's a good value for the price. It's just ok in our book, though. My son LOVED it for about a day. Maybe I expected more?"
4,A decent introductory text on symmetries for fluid physicists and engineers,"The book does a very good job of relating symmetry methods to fluid mechanics applications using physical interpretations of the results.However, it lacks the clarity of algebra that the book by Bluman and Kumei offers. Also, author misses out on citing certain important contributions to symmetry methods by other workers (identities are protected to avoid animosity)."
4,Finally Monster X on dvd!,"Okay, the dvd is not good quality. But it isnt supposed to be. I think this is a cool look at these movies just as they appeared on TV in the 70's and 80's. After all the dvd is released by a company called RETROmedia right? So why would you look for widescreen and all kinds of modern features? If you enjoyed watching these movies back in the day on TV, you will probably like this disc. GAMERA VS MONSTER X is a rare treat, not seen on tv or an officially released video in years. MONSTER FROM A PREHISTORIC PLANET makes a cool bonus. Overall, an enjoyable journey into the past for me, but if all you care about is quality of the prints instead of the movies you should stay away."
4,Good book,"This was a good book, until I started to dislike the main character (Jacy). Its cool for a women to be strong minded and independent, but her case she was a little over the top esp. the way she did Rich when he saved her she didn't even no where her last meal was coming from then she didn't even want to try to give him a chance. Very Ungrateful! I cant wait until the second book so I can how she handles being alone since her man moved to Atlanta and Rich is done with her also"
3,CSA,The movie was ok. The delivery time was good. The movie is like a histroy channel documetry. I thought it was going to be more of a comedy. but i was wrong so if you like histroy channel with a little bit of comedy. Then you'll like this movie.
3,Not what I thought it would be,"It was very entertaining, but I could have done without all the fake commercials. Still made you think of what could have been."
4,"Unusual, to say the least.","A interesting premise. What would the Country, the World, look like if the South had not only won the Civil War, but done so in such a manner that the entire country had become the Confederate States of America?Lincoln caught in black face with Harriet Tubman trying to reach Canada, slavery expanded across the continent, this film gives a viewer a lot to think about.Using not just actors, but archival footage (such as from World War Two) as well as reenactments (Gettysburg) the film brings the story up to the present day. In many ways a very disquieting, some times uncomfortable, film to watch.Could our country really have turned out that way? Would people have really gone along with the direction the film depicts? I would hope not.That being said, CSA is worth the watching. Just do not expect anything like ""Political Correctness"".'.'"
4,Hilarious but painful to watch.,"This mocumentary encompasses all the impact of a History Channel presentation and the faux commercials of early SNL to create a film that is both disturbing and entertaining. What history student has not wondered at some time about the impact of a Confederate victory in the Civil War? Wonder no more -- here is all is, intelligently written and presented -- impressively lacking in any over-the-top histrionics. The impact on more recent world events was well thought out.At the very least, CSA: Confederate States of America is tremendously thought provoking."
5,Very tasty,"I like these sausages better than other products from this company. Yes, they are a little expensive but worth it. I'v tried them boiled, fried and grilled with excellent result -- highly recommended. Check for specials for free shipping since it saves about 20% off the total price."
2,I've been trying and trying to get through this book. . .,"I started this book at the begininning of the year (2011), and cannot get through it. I find the style rambling and a bit incoherent. I understand that the book was self-published, and it has the feel of an indulgent grad student project.The book is written in first person, and we are meant to believe that a teenage girl would write with the understanding of sexual politics of a 40 year old woman, and I just never bought it. I never believed I'm actually reading the words of a teenager. Instead, I felt like I was reading the journal entries of someone who was trying to be deep and thoughtful. I really just wanted t keep yelling at the author ""Just tell the damned story already!""So I'm giving up, 150 pages in. I never, ever stop reading a book in the middle, but I just can't justify slogging through this when I've got so many other books demanding my attention."
3,Not Quite There,"Anthropology of an American Girl is an ambitious effort that doesn't quite get to where it needs to be. The novel is narrated by Evie, a unnaturally mature high school senior, and the focus is on her ""coming-of-age"" into early adulthood. The story moves very, very slowly and there is no underlying plot to keep the reader wanting to come back for more. The novel is also quite long, too long. The writing is very good, but the narrative itself is just too overindulgent--Evie the character never comes alive, she's just not likeable, she's just there, going on about very minute details about her life. This novel would have been much better if it were shorter and focused on perhaps just her life after graduation."
2,"Way too long, kind of boring",I just wanted to add my voice to say this book was way too long and not much happens. Evie is so brooding and beautiful. Oh poor girl! A rich man loves her and wants to take care of her but she is bored. What a sophisticated plot. Way too much writing and not enough happening.
