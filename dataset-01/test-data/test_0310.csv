1,can't get it to work,"I followed the confusing directions as best I could, and the device still doesn't work. I'm greatly disappointed!There should be some sort of customer service line or something on the internet that could help me troubleshoot the problem.Waste of money!"
2,Lasts for 6 mo,Broken after a half year (the magnet/sensor part). I am a light biker. The magnet looses over time. It was $9.99 last year.
4,Worthwhile to buy,"This item is a good one, looking at the price, its really a good deal, I will recommend others to buy."
4,Great For The Money,"Easily installed. Works well. Great device for the money. Only complaint is not being able to reset the odometer for each individual trip, but I may be missing something in the instructions."
5,Super fun and handy!,"Just finished a month long bike trip, and a friend bought this. It was SO handy! It was touchy at first to get the magnets lined up right on the tire fork and spoke. But when it did work, it did well. Through rain, mountains, and the bumps of 1300 miles, it did the trick! It was fun to know how fast we were going, the temperature, the fastest speed it had gone that day, etc. Though the calorie counter isn't accurate! :D Great item"
3,It was great when it worked.,It worked like its supposed too..or ever better...I just hated how it needed a extra wire for it to detect the wheel spin.Only if it was wire less it would have been much better.The only problem i had with this was it wasn't built tought enough.I droped once and it split into two-peieces.
3,bike computer,I have been unable to use this bike computer due to the fact that the spoke magnet was missing from the package.
1,Missing part,"I never got a chance to use this product because the magnet that goes on the wheel was not included. I tried to contanct Schwinn about sending a replacement, but had no luck. I hate to give it a bad review since I'm not sure if it works or not, but a missing part makes it useless."
4,Ganesh,"I started using this. This device is pretty easy to install, works great. If you want to reset all the stats to zero, there is no easy way of doing it. You have to go to each menu and reset individually. If there is a single buttion which can reset the stats for every trip that would be very helpful. But for the price and value for money this is great"
4,GOOD,I got this for my son that rides his bike A LOT.HE loves it his freind liked the it and got the same one.
5,BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK!,"Schwinn 17-Function Bike ComputerThis is definitely the best computer for the money. More functions then one needs but nice to have. The most important thing to do is MAKE SURE YOU SET THE PICKUP AT THE PRECISE DISTANCE FROM THE MAGNET. If not it WILL NOT work properly. You will also need to spend some time on figuring out how to set the functions. But when you figure them out you will find how easy they are to set. Don't get frustrated trying to set the functions READ the instructions and follow them. Its not that difficult. I have went over 200 miles using this computer and it stays on the mark.YOU WON'T FIND A BETTER DEAL FOR THE PRICE!!!!!!keep safe riding,Bill"
4,"Very good product,","this product is excellent for not very demanding, very good cyclists that of taking the control of the calories and consummated fat, as well as to be able to taste the temperature like which is one in that moment. good investment made, very good"
2,Swinn 20-non function computer,"The computer came on time, and seams everything was OK. Until I installed it on my bike,following the instruction. After I installed the same at first it did not work (initial setup was easy). The computer was supposed to turn it self on when I started riding the bike, unfortunately it did not. I checked the manual again it said that the sensor should be only 5 mm apart(1/4"")to work properly, after adjusting the distance it came up that the computer will work only when the sensors are almost tuching one another. After couple days riding the bike the computer was not working again, tried to adjust again without success. So I had to take it down and throw away.Maybe it was only bad batch, but I was not happy with this product, and I would not recomend to anyone."
3,Looks ok,"I haven't actually been able to *use* it yet because the wires came out of the sensor during the installation. Their customer service recommended them sending a replacement instead of me trying to reinstall the wires. I have not recieved it yet. Their customer service is very good ~ and friendly, that much I *can* tell you. I think I will be very happy with this product, but if you get one be very careful with the wires when you install it, otherwise you'll be fine =)I AM looking forward to using it, and I like that aside from all of the other functions it tells the temperature, here in Florida that is important."
3,WARNING THIS UNIT HAS A WIRE IT IS NOT WIRELESS,"I wanted a ""wireless bicycle computer"" and that is what I searched for on Amazon. This unit got good reviews and the price was right. IT IS NOT WIRELESS. There is a wire from the sensor to the unit, you attach it with tie wraps. Not a look I wanted so I am returning it."
1,Didn't work right out of the package,"I would have liked to have and use this. Unfortunately, it's so cheaply made that it wouldn't work when I took it out of the box."
3,Never worked well,"Have replaced this with new product, it worked well when working but seem to lose power for no reason and then would need to be reset."
1,Not well designed,"I encountered two issues with this speedometer. First, the battery could not set itself correctly. I had to constantly remove the back cover and ""jiggle"" the battery to get things working. The second complaint is that the sensor would not pick up the signal from the magnet unless it was sufficently close (1/16 of an inch). For all practical purposes, I couldn't use this speedometer.I subsequently bought a different speedometer for $25 and got everything working in 5 minutes. The sensor did not have any issues picking up the signal from the magnet at the typical distance between the fork and spoke.The cheap price was not worth the aggravation."
1,Functions would make it a winner if it's quality wasn't so horrific.,"I managed to put a total of 17 miles on the clock before the left button froze during a press, effectively turning the computer into a paperweight. No amount of prying or pushing will release it.My next bike computer purchase won't be the cheapest available."
5,Great Work Pants,"My husband's favorite go-to work pants. Double fabric at the knees, leather guard on pocket (one side--that's where he keeps his knife) and ripstop fabric. And I like that they fit well and wash/dry well."
4,Classic storytelling.....,"A great sleeper of a series which, in my opinion, only seems to suffer from a low (TV) budget and production values. The stories are what's key here though. Trust the 'brits' to pull this off so convincingly with little money.I also grew into the characters by the end...... Where's the sequel?~"
5,Met my expectations,I am pretty happy with this product. It punches a big stack at a time; you do have to be careful though if you are trying to punch handouts that are stapled because if you put too much paper at one time it will get stuck . This is a minor issue. I use it on a daily basis and have had this device for a month now and that only happened once. I will definitely recommend it to Amazon customers.
5,Two and Three Hole Punch,"The best feature of this is that you can change from a two hole punch to a three hold punch. It does make a little bit of noise, but it is well worth the price and a lot easier on the hands than manual hole punchers."
3,"Close, but no Cigar","For $20, this is not a bad humidor. The cherry wood finish is very attractive and makes the humidor look like you payed a lot of money for it.This humidor can hold much more than 25 cigars. You can fit in 35 Churchill sized cigars (50g x 7in)and still have some room.You get what you pay for though, the gauge is a little off. The tabs that you use to attach the gauge and sponge fall off especially if your humidor is humid.I personally bought some drymistat humidification tubes and threw 2 of them in there and it keeps the everything around 70% humidity.Overall rating 3 stars."
4,Great value,"The price is right, the crafsmanship is good, the equipment is accurate. The only quarrel I would have with this product is with the humidifier. It has a tendency to fall off of it's sticky magnet. It may be the humidity causing this, but I'm not certain. It is more than satisfactory with just the one complaint."
4,Great,"Works well although again the piece that holds the water (sorry not sure on the actual name) is absolutely not big enough, or does not hold water long enough. My Father-in-Law just puts a shot glass with water in it so he doesn't have to fill it everyday. It sucks, but it works I guess."
5,Good Product,"I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend and he really liked it! Just make sure you buy the solution that you need because it's not included. Also it took longer than I expected for the order to ship, so it didn't make it in time for his birthday."
4,Better than any other prenatal!,"I got this product because I had spent my first trimester cutting up the big horse pills I was first given. I have always had a problem with swallowing big pills plus the pills made me feel terrible! I had completely given up and stopped taking prenatals alltogether and then I bought this. It is easy to use-one tbsp in the morning and one at night. It doesn't make you sick so you can take it without food. No pills, no stomach sickness-all the same great stuff you need to give your baby the proper nutrition. It tastes like a mix between orange juice and grapefruit juice so if you don't like that taste, you may not like this."
2,The smell as it was opened longer got worse!!,"I didn't mind the taste when I first started using it, and it was great for relieving stomach sensitivities. After the first week I noticed the smell and taste got a little rougher. The longer I used it the taste and smell got unbearable. Oh, and the color got gross. Normally when taking medications you can fight through oder and taste knowing it's short-lived but I just fight through it for 9 months. Sorry. I had high hopes but I just couldn't keep taking it as it felt like it was rotting."
4,Blood Knot,"This story was as good as the first one I read by this author last summer. It evokes a true feeling of being in the Adirondack Mountains and of being a native instead of a summer visitor, as I am. The hero, s small town police chief is totally believable with his all to human traits. The book kept me reading far into the night. Hope more stories with this lead character are forthcoming."
2,Nothing special,"I really was hoping that I would like Amputechture. I liked the themes of the songs, but this did not hash out into an enjoyable release. The music was jarring and discordant, with no trace of melody to smooth the rough edges. Being unique doesn't neccesarily mean great music, and such is the case with this release by Mars Volta. I thought Deloused in the Comatorium was a great release, but I'm afraid to say that as a whole, the band is not for me. They make some interesting noise, but not enough true, quality music."
2,Disappointing......,"The Mars Volta is great but this album is terrible, its more noise than usual, at some points it seems like 2-3 songs are playing at once. The first track is awesome can't deny that but it progessively gets worse and worse. Make sure you sample this album at your local record store before purchasing, thank god its only $9.99. This album doesnt come close to Deloused or Frances the mute. Just listen before you buy and sample every track."
4,RESPECT and ADMIRATION,Great band from El Paso that have a lot of King Crimson spirit. Who said prog bands can't come from El Paso? Awesome music with outstanding guitar play. There is no doubt that they are weird but they are weird in a good and interesting way. I will be seeking out more of their work!
5,Respect the Rock!!!!!!,The Dictators have proven that age is no match for their brand of hard drivin' R.A.F.R. Their first studio album in over 23 years and it is just as damn good as anything ever produced. HDM et. al. prove that NY is THE place for rock!!I AM A CARNIVORE!!!!!!!!!
3,The Truth of Snood REVEALED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"When Snood was first created, the creator was credited for an original and amazingly designed game.Now I'll be the first to say Snood is a very fun game, but let me tell you about an old arcade game called ""Bust-A-Move"". You were a cute little dinosaur who controlled a little compass-shooter thing that shoots marbles of different colors. The gameplay is the same as snood, only they have different things to shoot (happy faces vs. marbles!!!).The bottom line is SNOOD is a rip-off of BUST-A-MOVE!Would you like proof? Visit any decent classic gaming arcade, or rent Bust-A-Move 2 Arcade Edition for N64 (or BAM for GBC). Thank you for attention, and spread the news!"
2,Snood Lover VERY Disappointed.,"I love Snood on my PC and Macintosh. It's a great game but Snood for the Game Boy Advance was a huge disapointment.A. Not only can you not save high scores, when you finish your game, the screen clears immediately with some lame animation and you can't even see what it was!B. When you try to play it at a any of the non-puzzle levels (kid, easy, hard, etc.) you get to play only ONE screen and then the game ends! In the PC version, you play until you die, not till you clear one screen.C. The menu and options are set up in a completely non-intuitive way.Although the game play (concept, strategy) is basically the same thing as the ""real"" version, the issues above make the game a complete disappointment. I was so excited about Snood coming for the GBA as it seemed like a perfect game to port over to this platform but they really messed up big time on this one."
5,Great mexican horror movie!!,"This movie is very good,when i saw it the first time,i couldn't sleep ,it is a very good story and it doesn't have any effects but that's what makes it so scary,i got chills just thinking about the movie."
5,Difficult to put down,"After cringing through the first half of the book where north African Arabs horrifically persecute Jews, it was a relief when I finally came to accounts of courageous Arabs, although not many, who helped them. I found this book difficult to put down. I heartily recommend it."
4,Interesting,"The material was very interesting. I didn't know much in general about WW2 in North Africa let alone about the Jewish plight in North Africa. Heard about the book on NPR and actually bought it as a Hanukkha gift for my mother in law. I did have some trouble following all the threads though. There are like 3 major sections and the first 2 overlap alot but look at different aspects of what was going on, I found this a bit confusing at times but overall I think it was a good read."
3,You Can't Tell A Book By Its Cover,"Encouraged by other customers' reviews, as well as my interest in learning more about bridges, I purchased this attractive volume. The price seemed awfully low for a work with such promise and, indeed, the photographs alone are worth more than I paid. But, having gotten through a scant 30 pages in which I encountered some errors easily checked [Xerxes was defeated at Thermopylae? The Etruscans were the forebears of the Greeks? The Brooklyn Bridge was in place in 1858?] I am left to wonder what else is hidden which I didn't spot. Who knows what may lurk in the engineering details of specific bridges and bridge types?"
3,"Good entry-level book, but a little outdated",A good book if you are just starting to learn steel design. Some of the formulas and tables do not match the current AISC Specification (2005 Edition - free download in PDF) and/or the Steel Design Manual (13th Edition).
5,Beautiful Gift,"Having recently re-located to the Northcoast of California, we became captivated by this great collection of photographs. All of our family and friends received copies to celebrate the beauty of the Northcoast. This collection is a great way to share what we see every day."
2,Childish,"This is supposed to be a kids movie, so I guess some amount of childishness is par for the course. However, it just doesn't get beyond pure silliness. The movie is cute for a few minutes of watching kids in adults' suits and pretending to adults' jobs, and some of the images are priceless. However, that gets old pretty quickly. As for the plot and acting, they're just beyond the usual terrible fare. I can't predict how a kid would enjoy the movie, but my guess is it won't appeal to many."
5,"If you only buy one fish id book, let this be the one.","If it swims, it's probably in this book; coral and reef creature books also available."
1,Quality problems,"We purchased this stroller because it seemed to fold more compactly and promised more recline positions. Though it arrived only several days after ordering, this stroller quickly became a disappointment. The front wheel hubs arrived so loose that the ball bearings began to fall out before I realized I had to tighten and adjust wheel to center on axle. Assembly directions were limited and accompanying pictures useless. Once assembled, my wife pulled the sun visor up and the support broke, the attachments on both sides were very tight and the part was flimsy. So, I packed it up, paid [money] to return it and bought a less expensive model from a different manufacturer - a much better product and just as compact."
2,stroller,"I thought this stroller would be great since it was the rubber tires and not the cheap plastic ones. I was wrong. Apparently they all have trouble veering to the right because mine does too. I just thought it was my lack of jogging skills until I read the other reviews. Also, the straps don't adjust big enough for my 2 year old son. I won't buy this stroller again."
2,DITTO,"AS OTHERS HAVE STATED, I WASN'T REALLY FEELING THE REMIX OF THIS VERSION...WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER WAS A REMIX OF THEIR ENTIRE ALBUM, VERSUS A SINGLE SONG...I LIKE THE ORIGINAL SONG, BUT THE REMIX JUST ISN'T WORKING FOR ME...I, LIKE OTHERS, FEEL A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS PURCHASE...IF YOU ARE A HUGE FAN OF THE BAND ( WHICH I STILL AM), DOWNLOAD THIS ONE INSTEAD OF PURCHASING IT...HOPE THIS HELPS,-CHRIS-"
3,Yikes!,"As far as I'm concerned, it was all downhill after ""Blues Skies"" - definitely Cassandra at her finest doing straight-ahead jazz. Why, oh why, must jazz vocalists feel the need to do ""The Monkees"" covers, put lyrics to Miles Davis' music (a mortal sin and outlawed in about 40 states)and other such nonsense? Yes, I am a jazz snob - I hate to see such an incredible talent fall apart! Anyway, throw on Blue Skies (NOT Blue Light 'til Dawn), kick back and reminisce, cause I don't think she's comin' back."
1,What is it?,"I bought this CD because it was supposed to be good. Except for ""Lay Lady Lay"" (Bob Dylan did a better job), I can't understand any of the lyrics. If I knew what drugs she was on maybe I could take the same and that might help, but I doubt it. Worse yet, there are no lyrics with the CD. Spend your money somewhere else. If you want my CD, I'll give it to you."
4,Great book,"very little written history exists from pre-roman europe, this is pretty scientific, for the time it was written. Not sure who Jane Gardner is, this famous book was allegedly put together by the ceasar seizing europe :D"
4,Fantastic!,"I'm not usually a big documentary watcher, but I loved this one. It's not a very typical documentary -- funny, sad, weird. And the music is wonderful. Watch it."
3,"Great footage, low quality video","After watching Riding Giants, I was excited to get this title. Unfortunately, the quality of the video on the DVD is poor and grainy, detracting from the viewing experience."
5,Engrossing and Entertaining,"I bought this book because it was a summer book recommended by USA Today. I was not disappointed. While I figured out one of the culprits of the murder early on, taking the suspense-filled ride to figure out why--with the main character, Sterling Bledsoe, kept me reading. The plot twists and surprises at the end were great. This book was very entertaining from beginning to end. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fast-paced, satisfying novel to read on vacation or over the summer."
1,Who likes this stuff?,"Man, it's absolutely terrible. I am ABSOLUTELY in the demographic of music listeners that this album is going after, yet I hear everyone praising it endlessly and I just don't get it. There are three good songs on the whole album and the rest of it just hurts to listen to. They have no musical ability whatsoever. If you're thinking about buying this album, do yourself a favor and get The Hives CD instead. I didn't think The Hives CD was that great, even, but it's much closer to The White Stripes style than either The Strokes or The Vines...and, unlike the White Stripes CD, listening to The Hives CD all the way through doesn't make me want to vomit."
2,What is this...,"Why do I keep falling for these fly by night one hit wonders. I kept the Elephant albumn only because it had Seven Nation Army.This albumn only has 1 good song ""Fell in love with a girl"" which lasts less than 2 minutes. Then the rest of the albumn is full of meandering filler that all sounds like the same 3 guitar chords, the same screaming and the same repetative drum line.This band spits out a albumn like every 6 months...They would fare much better if they placed all their good songs together and only released 1 album every 2 or 3 years.This cd will certainly be headed to the Used CD store...if they already do not have too many copies."
1,not even 1 star....,"this stuff is absolutely horrible. the singer can't sing, the guitarist can't play guitar, the bassist doesn't exist, it's a joke. ""fell in love with a girl"" has got to be the worst song i've ever heard in my life, right up there with the vines' ""get free"". those two guys probably have the worst voices i've ever heard in my entire existence on this planet. if you want rock get flaw or tool. ..."
4,"Another Good Album CD by the White Stripes, This one contains some real ""gems"" in it also!!!!","Overall, its a very good cd. It contains 16 songs. I don't think its quite as good as ""Elephant"" or ""Icky Thump"", but it is very good. Some of the songs I really enjoyed include: ""Dead Leaves and The Dirty Ground"", ""Hotel Yorba"", ""I'm finding it Harder to be a Gentleman (everyday)"", and ""Fell in Love With a Girl"". Thanks!!!!"
1,THIS IS HORRIBLE,This CD stinks. The White Stripes are sellouts from the beginning. I can't stand all the hype surronded by this fake rock and roll. Their music is probably syhtnesised and the singer has no talent. WHITR STRIPES STINK!
3,Exceptionally Strange!,This was a weird style. They are cool but there are a few things that annoy me. The guys voice sounds like puberty and there instrumentals aren't great. The guitar parts suck and the basss is good and simple. They have some really good ideas on here though and it's pretty cool. You don't REALLY need this album but if it's cheap go for it.2 best songs: Dead Leaves on the Dirty Ground & Expecting2 worst songs: we're gonna be friends & now Mary
1,Horrible - they mailed it in.,"I purchased my first White Stripes album a few weeks ago, Elephant. THAT album is awesome. So I purchased this one today because I loved Elephant so much. White Blood Cells is obviously mailed in. Some of the songs sound like they just went into a studio and slapped it together in 30 minutes.If you don't have any White Strips, buy Elephant. Stay away from this album. Horrible."
1,Big Deal,I really can't understand what the big deal with the stripes are. it's very strange. they aren't very good. it's nothing new and it's boring. people seem to like them for the same reasons they like jon spencer. but imagine the blues explosion playing a show with the stripes. they would blow them out of the water!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,white blood cells,"Today I with this rain I feel full of anger, but it is the autumn so the record of today is: WHITE BLOOD CELLS of the WHite Stripes"
4,Unexpected Find,"I heard ""Fell in Love with a Girl"" on the radio and I thought that it sounded like The Hives, which was good. When I bought the album and gave my first listen, I didn't know what to think. I was expecting a punk rock album, and ""White Blood Cells"" is anything but a punk album. It's just so varied that I wasn't even sure how to feel about it. However, all it took was one more listen to get me hooked. If you're tired of corporate rock with its slicked over sound and over-production, give this album a listen. It's raw sounding... the way rock music is supposed to sound."
3,Not bad. Download if possible.,"I admit, the White Stripes are getting a lot of undeserved and untrue hype, but they are a good band. Hell, compared the Strokes, the Hives, the Vines, and Jet, the White Stripes are frickin' gods. Their sound is a mix of rock, punk, and blues, and is always very catchy and good for rawkin' out to. White Blood Cells really isn't one of their better albums and isn't as good as De Stijl and nowhere near as good as Elephant, but it definitely has some good, solid songs. As implied in my title, if you can download it, do it, but I'd advise against spending your hard-earned dollars on it.Highlight tracks are ""dead leaves and the dirty ground"", ""hotel yorba"", ""fell in love with a girl"", ""i can't wait"", and ""we're going to be friends.""Bottom line: If you're looking for a good, simple album to have fun and rock out to, White Blood Cells is for you. Just don't expect anything life-changing."
1,Would do better buying something older,"This is pretentious, talentless, musically hollow garbage from start to finish. Avoid."
3,"Entertaining, but not original","Every time I play this album for someone, we get into a discussion about which band they're ripping off for each song... Buzzcocks, Kinks, etc. It's a fun album if you don't take it seriously, but I'm sick, of all this ""new"" music getting critical raves when it's just cloning an old sound that was done right the first time."
5,Kids love it!,"I have a five year old, and he loves it! It is the only game that he wants to play over and over again. It is great because the game is easy enough for him to play with his friends without constant parent instruction. I do have to admit the ""timer music"" will get on your nerves but small price to pay for your child's enjoyment."
1,Save Your Money!!!,"There is nothing about this video that is worth bothering with. Deason moves from one pose to another in a matter of seconds--all the while muttering inhale/exhale. There is little instruction, little education, and little pleasure in this experience of yoga. I am shopping for another video as I type...."
3,So-So Video,"I bought this video because I wanted to actually get to a point where I could at least touch my toes again. I made the mistake of trying to do the poses the first time I watched it. The pace seems way too fast for someone's first introduction to yoga. I think it would have been easier if there had been a little notice on it saying to watch it through one or a few times before joining in and letting you know that you'll need supplies to do all the poses. Although all the poses are supposed to be modified, I couldn't do some of them at all. Just to let you know, I'm 21 years old and an office worker so I'm really concerned about other people's ability to do this video when I had trouble. After doing the exercises about 8 times since I bought Gentle Yoga for Beginners, I can say that it's a video that will stay in my collection, but I will definitely be on the look out for something better suited to a beginner."
4,"Easily flowing between rock, soul, funk, C&W and rap...","This is an excellent album. Who would have thought that Kid Rock's turntabilist could put out such a solid effort? This album is very diverse, easily flowing between rock, soul, funk, C&W and rap. He has a nice voice, very reminiscent of John Melloncamp. He even does a duet with Dobie Gray on the classic Drift Away."
3,don`t excpect Double Wide,"I am a fan of rap music and rock music,and of kid rock.So when I bought Double Wide I really enjoyed it(except Follow Me).SO I HEARD IN A LITTLE WHILE on the radio,I didn`t like it but i thought it would be the only pop song on a rap rock album (I was wrong).So I tossed the album aside, until a few weeks later,when I was cleanin out my room I found and decided to listen to it again.This is when most reviewers tell you there favorite,but since I liked most of the album here are the tacks that took two stars away.In A Little WhileTo Think I Used To LOVE YouBaby Don`t Cry"
2,The holding case was not as pictured.,The kits are not neatly layed out as the image showed. The spools and bobbins were crammed in 3 small boxes layered on one another.
1,Wasted thread,"Hated the quality of these sewing threads. While the color selection was great, it doesn't help if you can't use it! Never again."
2,"Cheap, but cheap.","While I appreciate the variety for the price, the thread is wound on little cardboard rolls. It just feels cheap. I hope the thread stands up to wear and tear. But this is a good example of getting what I paid for, and since I couldn't find what I really wanted available anywhere for a reasonable price, then I am satisfied with my purchase."
3,Spotty,"I was mesmerized in the first section of the book, having hopes that I could give this one a five star rating. However, its failures come in later sections of the book. A Devil's Chaplain is a collection of odds and ends that Dawkins put together to make this book. Some of it is among his best, and some of it is boring."
4,Well.. I'm still not sold on tofu,"The Storey Country Wisdom Bulletins are short quick overviews with a lot of information in them. I read this in the Kindle edition, and my one major gripe with the Kindle versions of the bulletins is that unlike the regular books, if you turn off your Kindle, you start right back from the beginning and have to find the page you left off on.This bulletin has more then just recipes for cooking with tofu, it goes pretty extensively in how to make your own fresh tofu. I haven't tried that yet, but it doesn't look too difficult if you've ever made simple cheeses before. The technique is fairly similar.I'll keep trying it, maybe eventually I'll get used to the texture and have more appreciation for the recipes."
1,May not be safe,"We have had our Tike Tech Sport Stroller for a few months now. Overall it seams well built and easy to use except when we use it on hills. The baby sits too far rearward over the back wheels which makes it very unstable. When going up hill, the stroller tips backward. This has happened to me (luckily, the baby had the 5 point harness on). I could see where this might be dangerous if you were to need to put any of your weight on the stroller while jogging, especially since the brakes are on the front wheel. I have since looked at other jogger strollers, and they don't seem to have this problem. My husband and I are safety engineers and agree that this can be an unsafe product. I will be surprised if this review is posted. At least, I hope BABIESRUS.com takes a close look at the products they are selling."
5,The best ever,I saw this film the first time as a teenager and never forgot it. I tried to track it down over the years and have finally found it. It only took 30 years. It is a classic that never had it's due recognition. Great acting with great humor.
5,Olivier and Hepburn were great,"In this made for TV movie, Olivier and Hepburn were wonderful as two elderly people reunited by his love for her. The costumes, writing and acting are excellent. These two show us that great acting can be done no matter the age of the actor. The story is sentimental and hilarious and made us laugh and cry. If you haven't seen this one, do so."
2,Michael...what are you doing????,"I've heard the whole new album and I was a little disappointed...the whole album seems the product of an amateur!The music style is completely different from the previous albums, the lyrics are few and maybe too simple, THERE ARE NO GREGORIAN CHANTS(!!!!). Voyageur has good potentialities, but it seems that the whole album had been built up carelessly. It was quite a shock to listen to it because the entire epic-charming-sensual world of Enigma seems drowned in the sea of commercial...I hope to change my mind about the album...Instead of Voyageur I suggest Sarah Brightman's ""HAREM"": a really gorgeous enigma-like album!!"
3,nice read,"A nice read for all those interested in the 17th century. Especially amusing is the first persons harsh view on himself as he indulges himself in decadency and later gets cured.The character of King Charles II is a catalyst that intrigued me, though the end was somewhat unlikely it still fitted the story."
4,a good read,"I would recommend this book to someone who wants an entertaining overview of Restoration England. But I would urge you, if you enjoy this novel, to go to the real source, Samuel Pepys diary. The audio version, narrated by Kenneth Branaugh, is exceptional. Like R Tremain's main character, Pepys was an intimate of CharlesII's court. He was also an exceptionally honest and self-discerning diarist. The only real comparison in literature is Rousseau's Confessions. Personally, I feel that Pepys' is the more genuine self-examination."
5,Beautiful pictures!,"I love the images in this memory game. I am sure my son would be just as happy with the traditional version or a character-driven version, but since I am playing it too I love being able to enjoy the artwork! The pieces are high quality, sturdy cardboard and the images clear and glossy. Just beautiful."
2,"Whisper louder, the music is too loud and not very good","I respect the four philosophers presented in these recordings. Was really looking forward to using these recordings, but really only listen to the Deepak Chopra CD. The music is not that soothing and usually too loud compared to the female voices used to deliver the positive affirmations. The music and vocal tracks are not mixed well and it is more frustrating trying to understand what is being said, so be prepared if you choose to purchase this product. The female voices are also quite irritating to listen to, except the Chopra CD. The music is lacking in soothing vibrations and is also irritating. Not a good buy. Keep looking there are many excellent products out there. Peace, Ellen"
1,Too much loud music and not enough audio.,"I was very dissapointed when I played this CD as I was expecting information to be given in the author's voices. Instead, it's a woman's voice but the music drowns her out so that you really can't hear much of what she's saying."
3,"Nice, but not organized",I enjoyed the three routines. The moves were do-able and entertaining. I wish there was a cool down and stretch portion at the end.
5,This rocks!!!,"I heard about this show from other friends. When I saw it was coming out on DVD - I had to get it. And, I'm so glad I did. Finished the season in 4 days. It's dishy, fun, great soap. I can't wait for Season 2."
3,Thank God for subtitles!,"I found this far from addictive yet it is watchable,I could not understand most of the accents,,especially Ian,,,mush mouth and slurring so I was very grateful the ""translation"" to spoken English was provided..It is over the top but not in an extremely entertaining manner, I gave it 3 stars and that was stretching it somewhat,,I dont think I am interested enough to see the second season,,by and large I am a HUGE Brit TV fan,,love the Allo Allo , Hyacinth Bucket, MP Theatre, One Foot, Father Ted etc etc and this series falls far short of those high standards."
3,Not impressed,"The show is OK, but I don't know what all the hype is about. It hardly resembles Desperate Housewives. People say this show is racy and daring, but take away the little bit of curse words and minor nudity and the show doesn't even compare to the shows in the US. Sometimes I had to rewind and put the subtitles on because I couldn't understand their accent. So to get to the point, the show is alright but not close to Desperate Housewives, and to give you the heads up, most of the nudity in the show are the guys butts in the locker room, so men don't get too excited, and I hope this is not the reason why women think this show is so over the top."
4,A Lovely Voice Speaks Deeply of the Truth,"With great versatility and a voice of an angel, Bemshi brings us to many places. She knows what she's singing of, and her beautiful harmonies bring light to dark places. Wonderful!"
2,You get what you pay for...,"Shipping was lightning fast. The price was right. Unfortunately, I got what I paid for. The pendant arrived with a small flaw on the bottom front side. Since I bought it last minute I didn't have time to return it, but the finish was done poorly. I wouldn't purchase from this company again unless I had tons of time to ensure it was done correctly."
2,I HOPE I DON'T OFFEND YOU!,"I kinda like the barbie holiday dolls better. Why is MGA making a holiday doll in the summer? The only reason I could come up with is to make it seem as though Mattel copied them. Why is she not covering up her arms when it is cold outside? Atleast barbie covered her arms. I like the ornaments, but the humongous gown with pom-poms is a little ugly. If I wore that dress Iwould be freezing and I would feel ashamed at the hidiousness of the dress. I wish MGA would wait and think about it for awhile. But if you think it's pretty, then buy it!"
3,tight but not a classic,"I like this cd, personally I like their last CD much better. If you like the Luniz buy the album, don't bootleg it.........download the unreleased songs........average album........OAKLAND RAIDERS ALL THE WAY."
2,Typical Techno-Dance Compilation C.D.,"this cd is so typical of the techno/dance music industry: throw a couple of really good tracks amongst a huge mix of garbage, give it a fancy, curiosity-eliciting title [Euromix] and charge a leg and an arm for it. There's maybe one decent track for every 8 or 9 - they really start blurring into each other - and so, yeah, i'm a little pissed 'cause I was really looking forward to it since I thought Euromix 9 was outstanding. But save your money, you'll be disappointed with this batch."
5,"Great, low-impact workout","While perhaps not for the absolute beginner, this yoga sequence is definitely an excellent way to get a solid upper body and back workout in a short space of time."
1,A sad wee CD,I truly believe Cris Williamson should have waited a little longer before releasing this CD. It does not reach the heights of her earlier works at all and seems to be lacking a richness in the musical production. All in all a sad wee CD that is reflecting the sadness currently gripping the USA. It is not worthy.
2,"Hectically paced, poorly executed","Hermann Scherchen belongs with Jascha Horenstein in that quirky category of great conductors who recorded with such poor orchestras that it's often hard to listen to the results. Considering how truly terrible the Vienna Symphon(Pro Musica) was in the Westminster era, you have to tiptoe carefully indeed to avoid some real train wrecks. Even the Vienna Staatsoper orchestra, which is supposed to be composed of members of the Vienna Philharmonic, was veyr raggedy in those days. This is a breakneck Eroica performed without much technical finesse, yet among Scherhcen's Beethoven readings, it is typical in both respects."
4,Excellent except his symbol notation,"Very readable and highly useful book. One major hit. It is ironic that the author complains about the symbols in other books. For queueing he invents his own, instead of sticking with standard practices. This is very fustrating to readers that have other books on queueing and need to compare."
2,Shrill,"Michelle Murray has a shrill voice, especially on the attack. Ugh. My ears are still ringing. The songs are nice, though."
4,Small can be big too.,"This is a well-written, well-acted buddy movie minus the offensive Texas redneck/testoterone cliches running amok in other films. If you need car crashes, shotguns, and drunken barfing keep looking. Four freshly-minted high school grads (out of a class of five) face the classic should-I-stay-or-go dilemma. A little simplistic at times, it nonetheless works its magic and you are hooked. In a huge, sweeping, landscape this coming-of-age charmer plays out and though the town may be tiny, it's heart is anything but."
2,"Boring, Texas","I don't begrudge anybody their opinion, but I'm amazed so many people actually like this film. It's perhaps the most boring film I've ever seen. Period. If it wasn't for the cast, which includes a good number of my favorites, this film might have received one star from me and a much more stinging review. There is no doubt that the relative slowness of the movie was to paint a more accurate portrayal of small town life, but how does that explain the poor dialogue? For someone who is about to move to LA I never got much feeling of excitement from Breckin Meyer. The friend who's father ran a ranch(can't remember his name) had a story which was very poorly characterized. Maybe it's me but this film nearly drove me to tears it was so dull. If you're like me and enjoy the work of Breckin Meyer, Peter Facinelli, and Ethan Embry you'd be better off watching Can't Hardly Wait. And for the best Breckin Meyer check out the movie Go."
1,Do Not Order,"When my order for this phone clip arrived, I did not receive the clip that is shown in the picture. Even though I didn't get the correct clip I tried the one I got, and it was no good. After a few times of getting in and out of the car my phone stated popping off the clip, and once it fell in the water. Luckily I picked up quickly so my phone wouldn't get damaged, but for those of you looking to buy this clip- DON'T!"
1,tired of this song&it's boring,this is one of those songs that would have fitted better on a Destiny's Child Disc than a Solo Single.Beyonce doesn't show me much on this track.as tired as I am of Sean Paul he saves this Track.without Him this track ain't much because Beyonce sounds like a Back-up Singer on her own Song.how does that work?
2,"So much potential, so little interest","Had big hopes for this being an interesting series. Yeah, I hope for the end of war, hunger, and poverty too. If 50% less camera time was spent on Nancy Botwin looking dully confused and if 50% more time was spent writing a script, it might have been reasonably interesting."
3,An ok series,Pretty interesting but I felt I lost a little of my soul every time I watched it. None of the characters in this show have any integrity.
3,Excellent show!,"I really love this show. Everything about it is great, however I wish episodes were an hour long rather than 30 minutes. I give the show 5 stars, but the fact the DVDs are only in fullscreen knocks off 2 stars. I watched it on HDTV in widescreen and it was great--to watch it fullscreen on my widescreen TV sucks. They won't release Season 1 in widescreen, I'm sure--but I sincerely hope they do it with future seasons."
5,best of the bunch,"Good season of the show. Interesting storyline and the characters at this point are pretty likable. If you have heard about this show, this is the season to get. Writing is fresh and the concept hasn't been worn out. Humor is funny, rather than dark, as it is in later seasons. Great acting. Kevin Nealon is wonderful here. Everybody is. Characters will probably remind you of somebody you know."
1,Fantastic Show - Ripoff DVD - 4 by 3 Only!,"I love the show, but was horrified to discover that Weeds, which I originally watched in High Definition on Showtime, is shown only in 4:3 aspect ratio, old-style tv format on this DVD. This cuts off the left and right side of the picture. If you have an old set, maybe it won't matter to you, but the default for DVDs is widescreeen anamorphic which allows the DVD player to show old screen format just fine for old TVs, or the full beautiful 16:9 picture for new DVDs. If this show had originally been broadcast as full-screen (a codeword for 4x3) it might have been excuseable, but they should be ashamed to market this and Amazon should put a bigger warning on the DVD."
3,"cool show,but needs stronger writing","i got to see the show in it's first season&enjoyed alot of it for it's vibe,but the writing was underwhelming in certain areas.i dug the Main characters,but they are sometimes never fully developed&then you are left with a vibe that something is just slightly missing. still it's One of the few shows that I will check out on the Regular. it has room for growth&could be a tight show.of course the Leafy,Leafy should be Legalized!!! it'sa trip watching all of the various Dime bags getting created on the show. Cool Show&Some Hot chicks."
1,obsene,I was disgusted with the teen sex and language. The story content was NC17 rated. I threw the series away after the first episode.
5,Weeds anyone?,"HBO and Showtime have a gift for giving us these wacky shows that we cannot seem to live without. After I finished True Blood I watched season 5 of Weeds and was hooked, but I needed to see everything before. Wow was season one crazy. But in a good, fresh new way. Season two can only be better. Want something to take your mind off your life? Then Weeds is for you."
1,Hoax and Fabrication,"This book is ambiguous at best. It should probably be listed as fiction rather than non-fiction since it is so misleading in the way it sensationalizes the two divers with no real truth to back up the claims.Instead of wasting your time and money on this book I would recommend reading Gary Gentile's new book ""Shadow Divers Exposed"" since it proves to be an enlightening revelation on Kurson's fictional rendition telling the real account of the U-869. Gentile's book is an excellent exposé of not only the history of the U-boat war, but also the actual events, which led to the demise, search and identification of the U-869."
1,Give me a break,"This book reads well but the story isn't really that compelling when one steps back and examines it. Just about everyone in the diving community knew about this sub, so this is not an ""untold story."" This is a classic example of the industry creating ""buzz"" on one of the books it determines will break out. The unsuspecting public seems to be buying it hook line and sinker. There's far more compelling stories out there from the real veterans who were there."
5,"Amazing story, great writting, and very deep.","This is a fantastic book. Took me a while to get into it but once I did, I couldn't put it down. If you love crazy stories with a ton of surprises, this is the book for you. These men lost almost everything they held dear to discover one of history's greatest secrets.If you don't get this book, you are missing out BIG TIME!"
5,Deep Wreck Divers,"This is an excellent book. I love John Chatterton and Richie Kohler and have watched all their Deep Sea Detectives shows. This book not only was telling the story of the lost U Boat, it delves into the lives and feelings of John and Richie and their friends. I also purchased Hitler's Lost U Boat on DVD at the same time. Good documentary tying in with book, in fact plan on getting both."
4,"Great mix of history, science and action","Shadow divers combines a great mix of history, the science and technical aspects of diving, action and mystery. This book is a fun read for those looking for a good page turner that is exciting and fun."
5,Wow.,"I'm not a diver of any type but this is a great story. The author does a great job in bringing you again and again to the scene, and does it in a smooth and joined way. Here were two guys, Chatterton and Kohler, who couldn't stomach each other and by the end of the book were close companions. To me the book showed a group of people (divers) who apparently for many reasons worked individually, but in this instance Chatterton and Kohler became a team and their success was certainly a joint effort. Both are to be commended. The book also shows us that our ""enemies"" were also only doing their duty, with bravery and heroism. Kohler is to be commended for pursuing and finding family members of the crew of the U-869.How grateful they must have been. (But please don't compare this story with Krakuers's Thin Air....I have read both and find no comparison...Thin Air was a an effort to place the blame for a disaster....)"
5,What an AWESOME beach 'read'!,"I took this book to the beach along with many others...after seeing a shadow box display in a local restaurant showcasing items pulled off wrecks (near Hatteras NC), I chose to start this book. It is riveting and I have thoroughly enjoyed it."
5,A Real Life Mystery That Reads Like a Great Novel!,"From start to finish, I loved this book. What an unbelievable story of human drama wrapped around a fascinating history lesson! I highly recommend this book!"
2,Poorly inspected,"One of the hose ends had no threads at the ends so you couldn't screw it on. The hose itself was nothing special, about average what you would expect for the cost."
4,A Sneak Peak,"It is wonderful to be able to see the real personalities of the presidents, without the coverup that is seen today. The book allows the reader to see how the earlier presidents responded to their children, especially when they were not up to the standards. The letters of the later presidents are charmingly witty. It is a great book to read, especially when you only have a few minutes, you can stop at the end of each letter. Great to go to bed with."
5,"Great music, barely country","Jo Dee Messina is not hard-core or outlaw country. And hey, I like examples of those types of music in small quantities. But they're hard to take in larger doses. Jo Dee isn't. This album is almost pop-country, which means that purists will sniff their noses at it, but most people will enjoy it, or at least not be annoyed by it. It probably helps that even when she's singing about broken love (a country pre-requisite), she's bouncily facing the optimistic future rather than dwelling on the bleak past like too many other country songs.This probably all sounds like very faint praise, but it really isn't. There just aren't many albums, especially country, I can listen to in their entirety, without skipping tracks. This is one I can. It has some great songs and all the rest are at least good songs."
5,drinkwell filters,where i live all the water needs to be filtered. since i got the drinkwell fountain with its filters my cats have been drinking much more water and are healthier. they work well. thanks.
1,It's true - it's junk,"The installation software is useless. I can plug the unit straight into my PC or into a hub and the software still doesn't find the printer server. Call tech support wait a half a hour and finally get the thing up and running... (Tech support does seem VERY well versed in getting the thing up and running. I've called a lot, I know.) Within 2 days, the print server stopped working. It functioned intermittantly with a lot of fiddling for several months. Now it appears dead. Buy something else -- anyone have a recommendation?!?"
2,"Okay, but needs improvement","Compatibility: For USB connection: like many third party print server, this server does not support many LexMark color inkjet printers (information from LexMark and Hawking technical support). From my own experience, it doesn't work with LexMark Z705. For laser printer (USB), it works with Samsung ML-1710 laser printer nicely.Performance: The server must be **reboot** if I turn off the connected printer (Samsung laser). That's annoying for me. Usually I keep my laser printer power off, since I mainly use inkjet. Everytime I turn on the laser printer and want to print, I need to login to the print server and reboot, it takes about a minute in my Win2000 P4 system. Hawking technician told me it's normal of this server. I know other print server will not do this. So I only give it 2 stars."
2,Depressing,"If you want a book that is too long, too tragic, and too depressing .... this book is for you."
3,box dimensions,"A little creative Package Engineering would help this product greatly. It is well constructed, but the 18-1/2 x 16-5/8 dimensions limits storage. It will not fit in a file cabinet, on a standard shelf or in a wall cabinet. If it were ""double decked"" it would be much easier to handle."
2,Not user friendly,"The individual boxes are extremely difficult to open and may spill contents while attempting to open. Inside each of the six boxes are one T - shaped card and many individual cards that apparently are dividers. However, they are either too narrow or too wide depending on which aspect is used. They were secured with masking tape that when removed damaged them. I probably should have returned them for refund but they will serve the purpose for which they were purchased. I am disappointed."
4,So far so good,These were installed on a Polaris rzr and they sound really good. They are a little large for what we needed but are getting the job done. Have not had a real true ride or really put them through a test yet but so far so good.
3,Ninja chop action!,"I got this toy to go with the rest of the Shaman King figures i was collecting. For someone who just want to display anime figures the ninja chop action was a bit of a dissapointment, as i'm not really interested in moving toys. Plus he wouldnt stand up on his own (top heavy). The rest of the series was quite nice with Horo Horo (Trey) (stupid american translation) being my favorite."
5,Sweet Singing Tones and Airtight Construction,"I've been playing Hohner Marine Band ""harps"" (harmonicas in the 'cool' vernacular)since I was about 10. I've tried several different kinds of harmonicas over the years, but never the Golden Melody.I immediately loved this harmonica: the fine contruction, the great shape that moved across the lips so well, the ease of producing hand vibrato, and the sound-very sweet, but it can burn up some blues as well. The reeds were a little stiff to bend, but it loosens up with use and gets better as you get used to it (like just about everything).Buy one and try it, you will not be dissapointed, and it adds a neat new sound to my assortment of harps in all the keys."
4,"Interesting, if incomplete, BB trivia disc","Yes, this CD single features the famous Beach Boys Medley -- that is, the American 45 rpm single version -- which hit the top 20 or something in 1981. At the time, it was a pretty well-mixed medley of original Beach Boys hits from 15 to 20 years earlier, manufactured no doubt to compete with the then-popular ""Stars On"" hit single, a medley record of sound-alike musicians and singers covering the Beatles, etc.This CD single is given 4 stars for 2 reasons: first, it's the Beach Boys, so everyone should buy it regardless; also, it's a trivia single, not found on any other CD. It only got 4 stars because it SHOULD have included the 12"" version of the Medley, as well as the 12"" Ballad Medley, both of which were released on vinyl in Japan. Sham(e) on Capitol for not including those two gems as well."
4,It works,I took after school classes from Dr. Jay and his methods really work. The book is great and it is a good book for high school students to read.
4,"Nice Job, Ira!","I picked up this little book only recently, although itwas on the suggested reading list of Chem 334 (OrganicChemistry I) at Portland State U. when I took it there many years ago.This is an informative book and details many practicalsuggestions for those who have struggled to do well.I dig many of Ira's quotations, suchas ""Those of you who did well in school probably didwell IN SPITE of your work habits, not BECAUSE of them.""Strictly for laughs, and so true. Now, as a professionalchemist in grad school, I can more fullyappreciate much of the contents of the book and planto use at least some of it. Recommended highlyfor students who (like me) were doing very well inschool but could have been doing a helluva lot better."
4,Born in a Small Town.,"if you like Debbie Macomber Romances, you will like this one. It does have a few twists in it to keep you interested."
2,Born in a Small Town,I read about 37% of the book and it became so confusing and hard to follow as it goes in so many directions.
4,I got a little bird that told me this is an EXCELLENT cd...,"Although I personally don't like this CD as much as Elephant, it IS very good indeed. Definitely worth buying if you're looking for gritty bluesy rock.Favorites include the garagey ""You're Pretty Good Looking (For a Girl),"" the romantic and Beatles-esque ""Apple Blossom"" (every girl's dream song), the acoustic ""I'm Bound to Pack it Up,"" and of course the bluesy toe-thumping ""Death Letter,"" ""Let's Build a Home"" and of course ""Why Can't You be Nicer to Me?"" Also, the mysterious ""Truth Doesn't Make a Noise"" is a gem. Even ""Your Southern Can Belongs to Me"" is a fun, bouncy country song (think Hotel Yorba -- sort of).But the best song on the album? Without a doubt, the bluesy, harmonica-howling ""Hello Operator.""You just have to love them."
2,Over-rated!,"One word describes this band ""BORING"". Even for psuedo-mod 60's rock this album is just ""OK"". I have to admit there are a few good songs, but they just don't keep the energy flowing. I wish more bands would just try to make something more interesting instead of sticking with these trends. They have the ""LOOK"" down and even the style of music down for the ""60's FAD ROCK"" they are going for, but they're just not that good. I'm sure all the oovy groovy people that like to dress like the ""60's FAD"" will think that this is just fabulous and lovely. Go figure?"
3,bare-bones retro rock,"I normally love this sort of music - I generally listen to ""roots rock,"" Americana, folk, blues, country/rockabilly, punk/alternative. I expected to like this a lot, but I find myself strangely underwhelmed. It's OK but doesn't grab me. (Maybe 3.5 stars.) Good songs, but *so* sparse. People should be aware that it really is just the drummer and the guitar player-singer, with an occasional overdubbed piano or someone playing harmonica. I'll give it some time, maybe it'll grow on me. It took me a long time to get used to Iris Dement, now she sounds just wonderful."
5,This is a great album,"Not taking anything away from the other White Stripes albums, as they are all excellent; but this one's the BEST! I own all 3 of them, and this one has caught attention to it's fullest. You won't regret the purchase. Very melodic and bluesy. A couple of my favorite tracks include ""Apple Blossom"" and ""Jumble Jumble"". It's all about The White Stripes!!"
3,"I just would like to say, what the f**k is going on?","The reviewer before me is a f**kwit. He/She gives the album 5 stars, urging everyone to buy it, but is negative about quite a few of the songs, and indifferent towards more. If that's how you feel, DON'T GOVE IT 5 STARS. 5 STARS MEANS YOU LOVE EVERY SONG!This album is OK."
1,If You Like Origami... Overpriced Paper Box,"I don't know what I was thinking when I ordered this item. It really is just a cheap paper box, with paper dividers that need to be folded just so. Think origami. Actually, that would be giving a bad name to an honored art.You can pickup something at the dollar store that will do better than this item. As a matter of fact, the box that it is shipped in might do better. See if they can just ship the box, and save the $13 bucks on the product!"
1,SLIDE STORAE,"The divider box may have been nice, but the little pieces of cardboard had no instructions of how to fold. I contacted Adorama and they also could not find anything. They were good and refunded my money."
5,Laugh...Laugh...Laugh,"If you are into clean comedy, the TV series ""Banana's"" is on 4:00am,yep, AM, on Sat and Sun night's. I am hooked on it. Jeff Allen is one of the funniest comics I have seen since birth. His humor is about real life situations and his face and demeanor help make him who he is, A Star.Put a tight belt on and get ready to keep you insides from falling out."
4,A good film of one of Doyle's lesser tales,"The story upon which this film is based is patently ridiculous, yet here it gets treated with respect and made into something quite creepy and fun after all."
3,Prefer carbide paint scraper for wood,"I bought this scraper to use on oak. I watched a couple of youtube videos and learned how to sharpen it with a mill file, stone, and burnisher. I found it to be only mildly effective. Perhaps it is only meant for use on super-fine work. I don't think I missed anything - I belive I sharpened it and used it properly.On the other hand, a $15 paint scraper with 2 handles and a carbide blade worked AMAZINGLY well. Peeled off beautiful thin curly ribbons of wood with very little effort - at least 10 times faster than sanding. I would recommend the two handled version - the extra pressure you can exert with the 2nd handle is very effective. The carbide blade seemed to not go dull at all even after hours of work on oak."
1,Zero Velocity,Readers who have followed Mr Harmon in his role as a columnist for internet.com (Internet Stock Guru) will find little new here. Harmon fills too many pages with quips and similes (and re-statements of the obvious) instead of insight or research.
5,Worth reading,Steve has presented an in depth look at the venture capital world in this release of Zero Gravity 2. I appreciate his no-nonsense approach and his willingness to expose what goes on behind the scenes. Very good insights!
5,THis book is great!,"Ok, all I want to say is this book is great! In fact all L.J. Smith's books are great because they're so real. As, for the publisher, PLEASE START PRINTING HER BOOKS AGAIN!!!!! Anyways, anyone who would read The Secret Circle trilogy would be immensely satisfied. And as for me, I loved it!!"
5,Finally resurrected from the vaults! Great power pop.,"It's amazing that this record sat unreleased in the vaults for over 14 years. It sounds a little dated now, but if it had been released as planned back in 1987, it could've been huge. This is a great album of rockin' power-pop from the Atlanta foursome. The sound on this disc is amazing, it literally leaps out of the speakers. Buy this one and the ""two-fer"" of their first 2 albums as well! Hopefully their 1985 album ""Run For Your Life"" will end up on CD soon..."
1,Pathetic Attempt at Filmaking,"Don't waste your money on this DVD. It is incredibly quixotic in its aims and painfully tedious to follow. Chomsky seems incredibly out of touch, especially considering many of his positions. But even if you agree with him, this DVD isn't likely to enthral you either. He tries to directly connect terrorism and the larger issue of power without actually dealing with each issue. The viewer is left to ask ""What is terror to Chomsky?"" and ""Whose power, where?"" and ""What the heck is this guy getting at?"" He could clear things up and liven the DVD up and it still would seem bluntly ineffective. I've never given a one-star review before, but I'd give this zero stars if it was an option.Simply put, this DVD leaves you wondering why you just spent a good chunk of a day watching Chomsky ramble on about conspiracy theories."
4,"Bought mainly for the hit, rest of CD pretty enjoyable too","We all know what a great song Eres Tu is, so we'll skip to the rest.The music itself varies quite a bit on this CD. Amantes, on the other hand, is cut from the same cloth; Eres Tu fans will probably enjoy this song as well.The production values were as bad as I've heard on a CD. I don't expect that era to have as clean a sound, but there were also occasional dropouts in a couple of the songs. Very distracting. I am hoping that the original material does not suffer from this.One other thing: I'm not sure they've done this yet, but I think the Eres Tu lovers (myself not excluded) would enjoy an appearance of Touch The Wind somewhere on a CD. It was an English version to Eres Tu, the B-side of the 45. Not equivalent lyrics, but also very enjoyable."
1,What Size Did They Say?,"Will this crank fit my Grandfather clock? Clockworks, for example, sells these ""Grandfather Cranks"" in 5 different sizes. Anyway, it would be nice if this key would fit mine, but I don't think I or anyone should order it until they advertise the size."
2,Quickly breaks down,"After about 6 trips with the transom pad, it began to rip and tear. The pad is thin to start with at only about 1/4 an inch of rubber."
4,Helpful addition to the study of the 1836 revolution,"This book comes in for a lot of criticism, especially regarding the events at the Alamo. However, the book is well written and provides a great deal of insight into the plight of the Mexican soldier and the lack of military responsiblity on the part of the command of the Mexican army. The route of the army in and out of Texas is accurate, as is the description of the retreat. In reading the book, it appeared that a good deal of the content was used as background for Stephen Harrigan's ""The Gates of the Alamo"" (a highly recommended read). For Texas history buffs, the de la Pena book is one you should read."
5,Full satisfaction,The book was in perfect conditions as advertised. I received the book before I expected. Good seller.
2,Packers Throw,"I purchased this Green Bay Packers throw for a favorite brother-in-law and instead of surprising him with it, I returned it. The overall appearance of the throw was just as it was described, helmet & football, but the colors were off, the construction, I thought. was poor and it had a very rough feel to it, not anything you would want to use as a throw."
1,no warranty!,I owned this phone for less than two months before having problems with it. The first problem was terrible battery life followed by no signal. (even when standing under a cell site) I finally sent it in for repair. It came back with a note claiming it was not econimical to repair and that the warranty was void siting corrosion. In the short two months that I had it it was never in a corossive environment. I have since learned of other people that have had the same problem with Nokia's failure to honor their warranty.
4,EXCELLENT ZOOM-POOR BATERY LIFE & SLOW CHARGER,"I have this cell phone since May 8th. this year and I think it has some tricky good fashions, for example the world wathc, the fast acces to someoptions, but the best of all is the tremendous 8X zoom on the camera lens and the aditional digital zoom for after take the picture. I am a photography aficionado for some 20 years, and I think this feature is wonderfull, my Canon 28-105 lens has only 3.75X. On the other hand the very poor batery life is mortal to this phone: you take some pictures, make a few calls, look the pictures again an the battery is death! For worst the charger take a full two and half hours to charge the battery again; my previous Nokia 3220 do the same in one and half hour. Vicente Cardone, Barranquilla, Colombia."
4,A Good Start,"The White Stripes first CD is okay. I think they could have probably done better with the tunnel, bathroom sound you hear on Jimmy the Exploder, and The Big Three Killed My Baby. It is good for new starters but they had a lot to work to do to make Elephant as good as it is."
1,Want to lower your music standards? Listen to this CD.,"All you bad taste trendies thinking you are jumping onto something new and cool are obviously musically stunted bigtime! If this CD is your idea of good back-to-basics rock, then you need to find another band to listen to. This CD is the WORST i've EVER heard, with boring, 3-chord guitar tunes, and the worst vocalist i've ever heard over my 3 decades of listening to rock music! Sonically, the instruments sound compressed and flat, and the recording is the worst i've ever heard. Seriously.If you have any taste in music and recording quality, do yourself a favor and skip over this dissapointment!"
5,The best debut record in rock history,"or damn near it. Need I say more? A legend in the making. Let usbe grateful Jack White exists, and is currently putting out records. Amen!"
4,Sounded great!,Sounds great on vinyl! Haven't listened to it too many times but so far I'm enjoying it. Really digging Jack White as of late.
5,ROCKS,"Jimmy The Exploder, Stop Breaking Down, Astro, I Fought Piranhas.... Those songs there are enough reason to buy this album."
1,What a blast!,"These two know how to rock! Blues inspired punk rock with a hint of the 60's. A stripped down sound with great lyrics, some grit and intelligence. After listening to all three albums, a progression in style and some polish result in a great line-up of albums that never stop keeping me interested. It seems that whenever I have them on my car stereo, someone asks me ""who is that?""."
1,My favorite artist of all time but...,"He absolutely sucks in concert because he chooses to play medleys instead of the full songs. In the concert I went to, he mentioned he did that because people complained that he didn't play their favorite song in previsou concerts (because he has so many great songs!). I suppose that's a nice problem to have if you were an artist, but as a fan, I would rather hear the full song instead of 5 songs wooven into 5 minutes."
4,bason toy,this toy is great for enyone who has the ren toy. the ghost figures look like ghost becase their legs are clear. I want to collet all of the ghost figures
1,bella,i didnt want this.........i only wanted the cd for my husband for xmas. we cant watch videos on here. just want the cd that i order. thanks
3,Don't jump to hasty conclusions,"The previous reviewer probably hasn't read much Edson. True, I wouldn't put him up in the Z. Grey/L. L'Amour level, either. But I've read his books since the mid 70's, and enjoyed them as the action-packed, character-filled stories they are. In their entirety, his stories range from the days of the Alamo into the early 1900's. The Wedge crew were intoduced in the books early in the trail-driving era, and reappear throughout the series, singly and as a group. This last trilogy seems to be the last he wrote, and displays the results of his (unfortunately) lessening writing skills as he aged. But it is still a fun read."
5,Chi Kung for health: six seated meditations,I have been practicing yoga and meditation for a few years. This six seated meditations enhanced sensitivity to my energy body. I highly recommend this dvd for someone who wants to learn meditation.
4,Extremely education and informative.....,"A well written story of Cubans, the people, their background, education, character,as well as their unfortunate loss of their country to a regime that still stands. This would be the book to read and have your children read,it would give them a detail about the history (I am Cuban/American)of a once great country who liberated themselves from Spain, but have not been able to liberate themselves from Castro....the story of one people touching two worlds. Lilly Gonzalez"
1,Waste of Paper,"Misses the point. A vague look at a proud and diversified group of Americans. Fails to detail the contributions in culture, business and society that Cubans have made to the world and the reasons for their success in this country. Obviously written by someone who learned about the Cuban culture from similar books. Save your money."
3,"Seriously, one of the activities is to count fingers and toes...did I need a book for this lesson?","I wish there was a little more creativity in this book--I have not used it much so I might not be being too fair...but, when I saw that 2 pages (plus/minus) were used to show me how to COUNT FINGERS AND TOES I was a bit disappointed! DId I really need a book to tell me about this everyday activity? Really? Seriously?"
1,Unable to read,"Very promising, but a huge disappointment. I rarely give up on a book, but was unable to continue past page 26 due to the author's fixation on the child's bodily functions, which I found unseemly, unecessary and quite frankly, weird. Seven, count 'em...seven references...one would have been quite sufficient, thank you."
1,Encross/Kreisen BEWARE: TERRIBLE WARRANTY SERVICE,"I purchased this TV in March and began to have a serious video problem with it only a couple of months later. Whenever I use the AV1or AV2 inputs (including the S-Video input) the screen turns all green and I get a humming noise from the speakers. It works fine with the HD/component input. I contacted customer service at Encross and spoke to a ""Sang"" who told me he'd call me back with an RMA number. I never heard from him again. I have e-mailed and called and left several messages, but not not heard back from anyone for over two months.It's a decent TV, but don't expect any support from them!"
4,Could of Been Better,"ATL's independent Trio, The Calhouns drop their debut album. Consisting of Dungeon Family member Cool Breeze a.k.a. Freddy Calhoun, Lucky & Pauly Calhouns. They are also backed by affiliates Major Hog, Slimm, & Uncle. The production is handled by Organized Noize and themselves. The First 6 Tracks on the album are dope. ""Slapped"" is like one of those Southern crazy anthems. ""RPDG"" is a Freddy Calhoun solo. Freddy holds it down on his own track talkin' about handling the rap game. Lucky and Pauly do a good job over ""Street Life"" which is my favorite track on the album. The beat is pretty tight that was done by Organized Noize. Songs like track #7, ""9 Months"", & ""Some People"" are just straight garbage. ""9 Months"" is nothin' but a run down Drop It Like It's Hot. ""Some People"" gets on my nerves. Other than those and a few medicore tracks, the album is worth gettin'. Everyone should definately check them out. They deserve to be heard."
2,Crappy sound especially for the price,"Save your money, these sound like crap, I have $30 Creative & Sennhiser buds that blow them away.I have Sure E3 & a pair of Ultimate Ears dual driver buds so I know what Pro sounding phones can do.The only real difference between the $200+ Sure & ER phones & the $30 ones is there is no noise fatigue no matter howloud or long you listen to them but they are ""over the ear cable types"", not really comfortable for lazing around on the couch or bed they are made for live sound on stage to use while you are standing.Stig. NJ"
4,One of the kings of the New Jack slow jam,"Why Christopher Williams is not more well known than he is is a complete mystery. Not only does he have a great voice and undeniably romantic sentiment, he also has a plethora of killer connections (he's a nephew of legendary jazz singer Ella Fitzgerald, a cousin of Al B. Sure!, and he dated Halle Berry). This debut album proudly proclaims that ""this is the year of Christopher Williams"" and it was hardly overstating itself. All songs are good or great, particularly ""Promises, Promises."""
1,Waste of money!,"So so so!!! very disappointing. I threw it away. The glove looked like someone had smashed it. No wait, it look like something a 3rd grader made at school. Totally waste of my money. I would have been embarrassed to give this to my fiance as a get. Who is a big time Rocky Fan. He would have looked at me, like I knew nothing at all. Do not get this for anyone."
1,rocky glove necklace,the chain is poor quality and the pendant is not the same as in the movie. the pendant fell off the chain multiple times. Unsatisfied!!!
4,the Fox rocks- still!,"After six years Samantha Fox offers a new selection for american viewers. Unlike her past albums and singles this one is more focused on her techno styles rather than rock. Best of all her voice sounds better now than ever before and her video for ""Let Me Be Free"" is her first not to be cheesy. This song is also available on the Dance Hits Supermix2 cd. This is truley the best from the former page three model sense the Eurovision British themesong in 1995. Pick yourself up a copy."
4,When You Wake Up and Realize That Your Dreams Can Come True,"Taylor Robinson has been dealing with Brian Washington for a few years. She loves him and cannot wait until they are happily married. Though Brian displays his love in a different manner, Taylor will do what she has to do in order to live out her dream.Brian Washington does whatever he wants whenever he wants. In his mind, his controlling nature towards Taylor does not mean that he doesn't love her only that he loves her in his own way and vows to make Taylor his forever.Shonny has been number one with Taylor since they were in grammar school. She is always there when Taylor comes calling and even deals with Brian when he calls too. Not one to let Taylor deal with having an abusive man, Taylor realizes that the tables must turn and the games must begin.L. R. Townson gives us a quick read that doesn't take much to realize what is the moral of the story. Looking forward to the sequel."
4,I know I'm only living..,"..but it seems absurd to write off this album. Some people just don't want Bob to sound happy, or something. So what if he was deluding himself, you can't fool any of the people any of the time if you don't serve up the musical/lyrical goods, which he and the band sure do on this disc. Be ready."
5,Dylan Praises Jesus,"Southern gospel at its best. This is the one. I was lead to it by the 3rd Day worship album, ""Offerings."" ""Saved"" is everything I had hoped it would be musically and lyrically. Dylan sings gospel and backs it up with vocal gospel artists named Clydie, Regina, and Mona Lisa. This is straight up singing about our Savior.I also bought ""Slow Train Coming"" when I bought ""Saved"". ""Slow Train"" is very listenable, but ""Saved"" is in your face Jesus. Dylan, dubbed as the prophet for a generation, finally lives up to the title."
4,For Dylan Fans,"If you are a ""love him right or wrong"" fan of Bob Dylan, this is certainly an album worth owning. It's quite a bit removed from his well-known early work. It was recorded during Dylan's short-lived ""Gospel/Soul"" era in the late 1970's and early 1980's. If you want to get familiar with all the different styles of Dylan's work, then you'll certainly want to add ""Saved"" to your collection."
5,Saved my review,"Saved is a very good Bob dylan cd. starting with satisfied mind, this gosphelrock album rocks on solidrock and areyouready whatcanidoforyou is a great song pressingon and savinggrace are like the songs with the band. real good organ.inthegarden is a bio song about Jesus it is great sticking with the gosphels. saved is a good up beat song with the trobles being replaced by the joy of being saved."
5,Very Enlightening,"This book provided a great insight into myself. I've never really associated personalities with wealthbuilding, but this book made me examine and evaluate myself, which caused me to realize i was looking at things in the wrong way. The author suggests to leverage your personality type by choosing a path to wealth that you will feel fulfilled by. This is a great read for anybody looking to find a direction for their career and life."
1,A karaoke nightmare,"The title says it all, Dance and Sing, so it is not for a nursery. Unfortunately, these people have seriously butchered some decent kids songs with really bad Casio-tone synthesizer and karaoke style singing. Pop Goes the Weasel may be the worst one of them all, the singer seriously needs to pop some energy pills and get excited about singing. The only tolerable song is ""One to Ten"" which has a slight B-52s feel to it."
5,Sweet Nostalgia,"This soundtrack is a classic. Granted, it is mostly dialogue from the movie that is very well done. The score is beautiful and timeless and supports and punctuates the dialogue perfectly. I wore out my original LP of the soundtrack and now I'm glad to find it on CD to enjoy again. This soundtrack is not for everyone, but I think the dialogue is Romeo and Juliet the way Shakespeare meant it to be enhanced by a hauntingly beautiful score."
4,Best I've ever used,"It isnt perfect, doesn't shave as close as a razor, but it is the best I have ever used and I have had some expensive electric razors. It easily out performs my old Norelco quadra.I am a worst case scenario for an electric razor. This is the closest shaving electric I have ever used and it is the first ever to do a half decent job under my chin along my neck."
5,Excellent Shave,"Powerful, quiet and smooth. I've had Norelco, Braun and Panasonic over the years and the Panasonics are the best. Closer to a blade than all others. The wet dry capability is very convenient. The Linear motor simply can't be beat. I have a heavy beard and this razor handles it with ease. Also has a nifty lock to disable the 'pivot' function."
1,Where is the original box?,"I just received this shaver in a small yellow box, not in the original panasonic box. It must be refurbished one. This is the first time experience that I am unsatisfied with Amazon."
4,very nice shaver,"This is definitely the best electric shaver I've owned. I've used the Norelco rotaries, including one of the new models which dispense gel, and a Braun foil shaver prior to this one. I retunred the Norelco prior to getting this model from Amazon. It takes me a while longer to shave with it to be sure I get all the hairs (it's sometimes difficult to see through the shaving cream), but once I'm done my face is as smooth as it can be."
4,Panasonic pluses,I find the ability clean the shaver by rinsing it under the tap a big plus and it shaves and recharges fast!
2,NOT THE BEST,I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THE ES8152NC PANASONIC SHAVER. NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE. BACK TO MY BRAUN.
5,"For me, better than rotary heads.","A give it a try shot attitude has been pleasantly rewarded. I waited for a good deal and good reviews to try a linear shaver and am very happy with this Panasonic.Been using disposable blades for years after writing off electric shavers. I had tried a couple 3 blade rotary heads and they never gave me a close shave. The harder I tried the more they tore up my face. Often thought that the geometry of a linear shaver would put more blade front in contact with a beard at any one time for a better shave. However I feared electric is electric and it would irritate also. For me, happily not so.So far I've used this razor in the hardest way. Dry with no beard preparation at all (not even a wash). Done this on purpose as a worst case test not only to see if it could produce but also to see the effect on my skin. It's given me good shaves and surprised me with no irritation. Love the gimbal action."
5,A great book by a great mind,"No one can read My Life on the Plains without coming away with a changed view of Custer as a military leader and an important historical figure. I often tell people that Custer was a great writer and direct people to read this book. I am occasionally met with laughter and suspicion--except by those who take my advice and read it. Amazingly well-written, and very descriptive."
5,Magnificent!!!!!,"I just started listening to Eros a few months ago, .... what a voice! He writes music SO well, and is SO handsome! Give it a try even if you don't speak Italian or Spanish, ... I don't :). You'll LOVE it, don't worry!"
2,"Fine book, dreadful printing","This is the book it is advertised to be. The printing is atrocious, though; there are no illustrations (although bracketed descriptions of them survive, so you can close your eyes and imagine them), and the font is unreadable fixed-width throughout. Spend a few more dollars on a decent-quality printing of this great book, because despite the trumpeting on the cover, ""Affordable & High Quality Paperback Book Edition"" is only half right."
4,Good overall video,"We have soo many Sesame videos but this is not my son's favorite. It is a good video and teaches kids about brushing teeth and getting dressed, things I think will help me to teach my son when he's a little older, but for now, he just wants to watch good old singing/dancing videos."
4,love it,This is a great video that shows kids to brush their teeth and get dressed. But importantly brush their teeth!!
2,Not Much Elmo,"My two year old loves Elmo. We first bought the Elmo Potty Time Video and he absolutely loved it. It had plot, narrative, songs-- everything I associate with a quality Sesame Street Product.Maybe I'm just not a fan of the ""Elmo's World"" concept-- Elmo yells at an imaginary door, then a shade, then a computer yells at him.... I don't like the set (crayon scribbles instead of real objects and furniture as in Elmo's Potty Time).My son will watch when Elmo is on--- but during the parts with Mr. Noodle, etc. it might as well not be on.For Elmo fans--- and fans of the old fashion high-quality Sesame Street productions--- the Elmo's World series is probably not for you. It certainly wasn't for us."
1,Doom has no place in the garage,"Thergothon was one of those doom/death outfits with status in the previous decades. They were discussed around doom circles, but never really hailed as one of the greats. After wasting my cash on this CD, I now know why.Everything about Stream From the Heavens is amateurish at best. The music is pieced together cut-and-paste style with uninteresting power-chorded rhythms that make little use of the melody that this genre has trademarked. The lyrics and vocal presentation are extremely weak, and the production is one of the worst in my collection. Even if something interesting was captured on this recording, you could barely hear it over the obscene amount of high-end in the mix anyway. Thergothon is a band that will make you want to openly weep. . . out of sheer boredom, and the $50 import price is not worth it at all! I purchased this CD for $10 through an underground distro, and even then I feel that I've wasted my money.-l-"
5,New Loyal Customer!,"I read the reviews on all the different types of poppers because I wanted to get away from microwave popcorn and make it something fun for the family to do. After reading all of the reviews for the Whirley Popper and the 25 year warranty, I decided this would be the product for me. The All-In-One popcorn packets made it so easy!!!! Everyone loved it. The best part of this product is the customer service that comes along with it. Another review had mentioned to go online and register your product when it arrives. I did this on a Friday, and by Wednesday Wabash had sent me a welcoming gift of free popcorn. (I was impressed that it didn't take 6-8 weeks like most companies). The warranty is a huge plus! The only complaint that was repeated throughout the reviews was the plastic parts break over time, I figured with that kind of warranty I'd be a fool not to buy it!!!"
5,best popcorn ever.,"My wife uses this constantly. It makes fantastic popcorn. It's a bit cheap feeling, but it works fantastic and we have had no issues whatsoever."
4,Good popcorn maker - not so thrilled about the gears,"This is a great popcorn maker for those who want traditional popcorn. I have an older model and wasn't too happy when I saw that this new one has gears that look like they were made of plastic and not metal. I don't think it will last as long. That being said, I make all sorts of popcorn in this, including kettle corn and it works great. Very few old maids and tastes so much better than the microwave stuff. It takes approximately the same amount of time as microwave popcorn so well worth it!"
5,Wonderful Popper!,"I simply love this popper. I was not sure what to expect at first, but have been pleasantly suprised. I wanted to get theater popcorn without spending a few hundred on a theater popping unit that would take up a ton of room. This has been exactly what I was looking for. If you follow the included instructions you will be fine. One thing I do watch for is not to keep turning once it is obvious that you are coming up against a lot of resistance. I do go back and forth for a little bit to help keep the mixer free. My kids love it. I have used it for home movies and I have also taken it to a boy scout lock in and popped corn for a huge amount of scouts having a great time. They were thrilled. I also purchased some coconut popping oil and it is wonderfulParagon Coconut Popcorn Popping Oil (Gallon). The popcorn I purchased is thisParagon Bulk Quad-Bag Yellow Corn, 50-Pounds (4-Pack, 12.5-Pound Bags)and it tastes great. You cannot go wrong with this popper. Buy it now and start the fun!"
4,Classic Nashville gospel album reissued,"Connie Smith's girl-groupish country hits started to mellow out a bit after she got 'born again' in 1968... This CD is a reissue of a previously hard-to-find album of gospel duets she recorded in 1969 with Nat Stuckey. It's a nice mix of her bouncy style and more serious, ornate Nashville Sound countrypolitan. Might be a little cheesy for some, but for Connie Smith fans who have despaired of ever finding a reasonably-priced copy of the original ""Sunday Morning"" album, this disc is a godsend."
5,Exceptionally Beautiful Music,"For those who need an uplift during life's continuing trials, this is the cd for you!! Beautifully composed and sung! Each song is full of hope and inspiration!!! Worth every penny spent plus some!! Highly recommend buying and listening to music for wonderful daily pick-me-ups!!!"
1,Sheer Genius!,"It is often said that genius is the finding of simple, elegant, obvious solutions that nobody ever thought of before, but that, when shown to us, seem so obvious we wonder why we didn't think of it ourselves. Such is the case with this brilliant album title. For the first time, we have a punning title that subtly references the use of illegal drugs. You see, ""Waiting to Exhale"" is the name of a famous book and movie from about 9 or 10 years back. By changing one word at the end of the title, to its antonym, the artist has ingeniously made an allusion to the smoking of marijuana, which I am given to understand is a popular recreational drug in both the youth counterculture and the black ghetto. I slap my head and wonder why no popular music artist had ever before thought of making sly references in his music to recreational drug taking. I stand it awe of this album's simple yet profound elegance and I hereby salute the arrival of a true genius."
2,Favorite song not on the soundtrack,"The scene when they're in the bar, just before they leave for vietnam, there's an emotional piano instrumental. Its not on the soundtrack, so if you're looking for it, its by Frederic Chopin, called Nocturne Number 6, Opus 15-3, in g minor."
5,Simply magnificent...,"After listening to this soundtrack, I finally realized what truly made The Deer Hunter movie so special. Sure, the story was riveting, and the actors were at their individual best in this Academy Award winning film, and the settings (both Vietnam AND the dirty, gray cold steel town) were so realistic.But...Watching the movie in the theater some 24 years ago, I now remember the beautiful music. The timely, sweet theme ""Cavatina"", the orthodox Catholic church hymns, and yes, even the Frankie Vallie ""Can't Take My Eyes Off of You"" (missing from the sound track).It's enough to make you just stop... and think about the lives of those innocent men and how their lives changed in a flash when they went to Vietnam.Beautiful, touching and moving music, all part of one of the best motion pictures ever to see the silver screen. Even if you've never seen the movie, GET THIS CD... and go rent the movie, too!"
4,DOOM DOOM DOOM....BOOM BOOM BOOM,"Metal may have changed a lot over the last 30 years, but thereis no doubt who are one one of the rulers. This double CD setreally captures Sabbath at their artistic peak. The riffs maynot be as bone crunching as that of later Sabbath releases ofthe '80s when Metal really picked up speed and virtuoscity, butyou can really get a sense for where this was all going to lead.Toni really sounds great. The real surprise has to be Ozzy. His voice had so many less miles on it that it leaves you wondering ""Is that really Ozzy?"", and of course it is!!!"
2,Useful but not as a cookbook,"If you can find this book at a deep discount, it is worth buying for its breathtaking photos and diagrams of architectural constructions in ice cream and cake. The actual recipes, however, are based on French government formulas for professional ""glaciers"" (ice cream producers), and tend to include such ingredients as trimoline and stabilizer. Even things like butterfat and powdered glucose seem pretty mysterious.If you're looking for sorbet recipes, I recommend Caroline Liddell, ""Frozen Desserts,"" or Shona Poole, ""Iced Delights.""If you're looking for ice creams, I recommend Bruce Weinstein, ""The Ultimate Ice Cream Book,"" or Marilyn Linton, ""125 Best Ice Cream Recipes.""I can't list my site here, but if you do a search on ""ice cream bibliography"" (with quotes like that), you may be able to find my annotated list of ice cream books and recipes."
3,"If you need SACD, buy this one, but...","the cd layer is not any better than the cd remaster from the 90's. Get that and save some money. And that is no great recommendation, as few modern jazz sessions sound as poorly recorded and remastered as this one was, which is really unfortunate as the music is great.Having said that, as I don't have an SACD player, I don't know if the SACD layer is the same crumby remaster as the cd layer. Take your chances.I am trying not to be cynical, but one gets the feeling that the music, and the customer, and the musician's interests are secondary to pumping out product."
5,So far...So good,"I found this book for $5.00 in Family Dollar today. So far, I have really enjoyed reading it. I can't put it down. It explains the Bible so simply that almost anyone should be able to understand it. It provides that background knowledge of the Bible that most of us may not get by reading the Bible on our own. I highly recommend it for those who want to understand the Bible better."
3,A good biography of a remarkable woman,"This book is well-written and researched, and has much to recommend it. However, I gave it three stars because I prefer ""Vicky"" by Daphne Bennett, which is out of print but much more symphathetic to its subject. Ms. Pakula is a little harsh in her judgments. Neither book explores Vicky's health problems, which are set forth in John Rohl's (et al.) ""Purple Secret"", containing an excellent chapter on Vicky. All three books should be read for a complete understanding of her personality."
4,Definitely has its moments,"Like too many Oz books (including Baum's), it's pretty much a wander-around-meeting-weirdos story with minimal plot. But this one has some great stuff in it. Starting with Pigasus, the flying pig. When I want to explain, briefly, to a novice, what's great about RP Thompson, I describe Pigasus. And Ruggedo's adventures are absorbing, and we get the best pictures of him, cowering and snarling. PIRATES is his last major appearance; in HANDY MANDY he's a bit part. PIRATES is also his most sympathetic appearance. We are actually glad, for instance, when he gets to eat and rest well as King of Menankypoo rather than sleeping on the ground. And you'll cheer for him when he uses the Standing Stick on the pirates."
1,Needs more examples!,"I think this guy has a book about how the inmates are running the asylum...well this book suffers from what happens when the subject matter experts (SME) are allowed to write books. BORING!!! SME's always seem to forget to include compelling examples. Yes there are little screen shots, but IMO in order for a book to be compelling that has to do with design...it needs to show LOTS of examples of good design. The bulk of the book should be about breaking down those designs. I need to hear why a specific design is effective. Take a hint from Steve Krugs book ""Don't Make me Think"". That book is extremely effective without inundating the reader with jargon. Lots of examples with meaningful visual breakdowns. Afterall...isnt UI design a VISUAL communication form?"
3,"Ok, nothing more","All of this material has been circulating for years. I don't think anything is really 'new'. But thats the case with the hardcore fans I'm sure, probably not the more casual Sabbath fans. But even they have most likely heard disc 1, which is just a somewhat hacked version of ""Live At Last"". Having said all that, I still always enjoy hearing Black Sabbath and I know that many people who haven't all ready heard this material over and over will really get a kick out of it. So I can't really knock ""Past Lives"", it will serve it's purpose. The high price is kind of annoying, pick or not, but I'm sure this will eventually be a semi-collectible."
5,affection for the characters and their lives,"what a lovely film this is. i had seen ""the cat returns"" and been rather disappointed by it after enjoying many other studio ghibli things greatly, but ""whisper of the heart"" is totally different, both in the kind of thing it's trying to do (it's not fantasy) and in its levels of emotion and inventiveness. i'm giving this film full marks - sure there are things i don't like so much here (e.g. the kitschiness of the baron himself and his lady friend), but they're of minor significance. the characters are so great - i feel such affection for them that it's genuinely sad to reach the end of the film and know that that's all i am ever going to know about their lives.as a bonus, if you watch the dub, that's very nicely done as well."
3,Cute,"It's a light-hearted, cute story. If I wanted to know what it was like to be a junior high schoolgirl in Japan, I would watch this film. It's not magical fantasy like other Studio Ghibli films, but it will leave you in a more optimistic frame of mind. This is the kind of film that develops kindness and warmth in the human heart."
1,The problem with only using advocates is you get one side of,"The problem with using advoates as authors is that you only get one side of the story. In the case of EMDR, for instance, there is research that says a) the eye movements are unnecessary and b) its effects do not last as long as Cognitive-Behavior Therapy based exposure procedures. This really undercuts the second part of the title of this book ""for Long-Term Change"". Stories and anecdotes are often entertaining but for true treatment help see a professional who reads the scientific research and is not a cheerleader for every fad that comes along."
4,Excellent Hagar Record..,"More quality melodic hard rock from Sammy, with a good dose of fun for good measure. Really, Sammy had (and still has- you try singin' 'Dreams' at 63!) an amazing voice, wrote quality rock tunes and was a stickler for good playing and production, and some surprisingly thoughtful lyrics. This album is no exception and would be a complement to any good rock and metal collection that veers a bit more towards the melodic side. Van Halen fans need to get it, too. Eddie's on bass."
4,good cd,I bought this when it first came out when it was untitled i have it on cassette. To me its the last good cd he put out. I like all of older stuff.
1,Don't Bother,What a waste of time to watch. Just a bunch of critics saying what they think of songs..hardly any Queen footage or interviews. I returned it!! Buy the videos of their music....it's much more entertaining.
1,Horrible. Just search google!,Keep away from this drive - particularly firmware V7.01. This drive was installed in many Apple products including Macbooks and Mac Minis and all are failing in an unrecoverable way.[...]
3,An Elmore Leonard Miss,"I usually like Elmore Leonard's books and most of the movies made from them. Unfortunately this movie fell a bit short. It was too skewed to the brutality and less on the imaginative twists. I would have liked to see a better transition from the FBI manhunt to their acceptance of ""Blackbird's"" death to the stalking of the victims. Good acting by Mickey Rourke and Diane Lane."
3,"Even cut up, worthy of a look","As many have said, what was the whole thing like? The acting is enough to hold the watcher. Gordon-Levitt is worth the price of admission. And any movie that tries to stay close to Leonard's original ideas and dialogue is worth more than all the recent crap that sells itself as hard-boiled thrillers."
2,bellflower,"if you like mickey rourke you will like this movie, it was a ok, not one of his best thou."
2,Oh my...,"I wanted to see this movie because I like Mickey Rourke and I heart Joseph Gordon-Levitt. In fact, Levitt is pretty much the only reason I watched it to the end. This movie turned me off from the very beginning with Rourke playing some sort of evil character reminiscent of a naughty Steven Seagal. I thought we left all of the Caucasian mock NDNs back in the 1990s!The plot of this movie was pretty nonsensical. There wasn't enough action nor wit to distract the viewer (if only momentarily) from the hole-ridden plot. There were a few mildly surprising scenes in the movie, which is why I gave it 2 stars instead of 1. If you're bored and home alone on a Friday night, there's no harm in watching this. However, it's seriously not worth having on DVD."
4,Rosemary is still eerie and scary without the bloodshed of recent horror films,This movie retains its eeriness considering there isn't the goriness of horror films which came later.The blu-ray transfer is top notch. Extras are good but missing a comprehensive audio commentary causingthe 4 instead of 5 star rating.
4,Great film,Great film ....can watch it over and over. The transfer is wonderful and the back story and making of is very informative
4,Excellent Overpriced Film,"Criterion was always a step above with LaserDiscs but they leave a lot to be desired on blu-ray, especially with the prices that are usually 50% higher than the norm as they were with the lasers. The picture quality on this excellent film left a lot to be desired. It was just not that good. Should have just stuck with my DVD copy. The older color films (some, not all) in general are not that great on blu-ray. Some are very poor leading me to suspect that they're just turning it over for a quick buck. Spielberg's films are a notable exception along with the recently released Lawrence of Arabia. Another David Lean classic 'Bridge on the River Kwai' was terrible in quality. Another bone I have with Criterion is 'A Night To Remember'. My DVD of this B/W film was excellent but suddenly stopped working with the later generations of players. Was forced to buy the overpriced blu-ray Criterion reissue."
5,Still one of the best after all of these years,"I bought this movie because I wanted a good quality copy of the movie. I was not dissapointed. Criterion did a great job: the movie is very clear and crisp.This is one of the all time great horror movies. This movie proves that it does not take blood and gore to make a great horror movie, but what you don't see is sometimes a lot more powerful. I have not watched the extras yet, but the quality of the movie is well worth the money to me."
3,FYI,"ACTUALLY, ONLY TAXI TAXEE IS UNAVAILABLE. BOTH GIRL LYING ON A BEACH AND INSTANT REPLAY WERE ON AN EP INCLUDED WITH EVERY ALBUM PACKAGE I'VE SEEN"
4,BAM!,"Just when you think you've got it all figured out, BAM! Life hits you over the head with a rock. I was sent this book when my husband passed away. It was comforting to know so many other people, including members of the clergy, think God does not make sense all the time. Since life can bring down the rain pretty hard, this book brings it back full circle. I also recommend Joyce Meyer, Battlefield of the Mind in addition to this. Once you have been attacked by life challenging events, satan can really take ahold of your mind and have a field day."
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK!!,"I've prayed to God to enable me to keep my faith in Him for all my life, because I know just how vulnerable I am to Satan's lies. And the Lord granted me this book- with it, I am SURE I will NEVER let go of my faith and trust in His Will. In addition, this book has also answered MANY of the questions I had about God and how He works. Dr.Dobson is a wonderful person!"
5,"Great shoe, comfortable and waterproof!","This is my first pair of Keen shoes and will not be the last. I bought these locally at an outdoor sports store for the same price as Amazon offered after looking at Keen sandals. These fit very close to size and seem to replace my need for traditional hiking shoes. Being waterproof and machine washable makes them the most versatile shoe I own. The shoes are tough and the rubber toe area works great. The laces are designed to keep the shoes tied tightly as they appear to be 'twisted' for better knot strength.I wear these shoes outdoors and for outdoor and hiking purposes only, they definately have a unique look to them and should last a long time."
2,Loose Shoe,I bought these at Dicks. The back of the shoe was very loose and rubbed against my heel. I ended up returning them. They just fit funny. I am 11 and 1/2 and bought this size. 11 was not a good fit so it had to be the shoe. The shoe looked good and I wanted them to work but they did not.
2,If only the title had stated the locale...,"Without doubt the book set is helpful for identification of marine creatures, fishes, and corals. However, it would definitely be helpful if the book set title includes the locale for the set. I bought the book thinking that it encompasses the reefs of the world. Alas, how wrong I was as it was only meant for the Carribean and Bahamas, while I leave on the other side of the whole in Indo-Pacific. No use returning as return shipping cost more than half of purchase price.If only the title had included the locale for the set. Yes, some of the reviews had it, but only read it albeit belatedly.Does the publisher have a Reef Set for Indo-Pacific?"
5,Great Resource,"If you dive or even just Scuba you will learn about everything you've seen. If you're a marine biology student, it's even better."
3,"A good, gritty historical representation of a point in time","This film was panned by reviewers when it came out, but I'd have to say that it presents a grittier look at the events surrounding the Alamo than have previously represented on screen. The characters were interesting, although it seems that they may have been exaggerated a bit to emphasize their actual position during the events that they underwent.The ""making of"" and other extras on this DVD were an excellent addition to help put context behind the events that surrounded this place and time and why (or why not) the characters represented were extraordinary in their own right.Definitely worth seeing it once with all of the extras all the way through. The pacing is spotty at best in that the anticipation of waiting for the final battle isn't always felt by the audience."
1,A very big and wasted mess......,"Just another example of why Hollywood simply does not work anymore. A very tired idea, a very bad screenplay, a young inexperienced director (who showed heart anyway), a studio ""by the numbers"" production, with some nice acting along the way (Billy Bob as usual), leads to the very ""big yawn"" and a 100 million dollar mistake! Don't waste your time on this one!"
1,Terrible Movie,"I have seen the numerous amount of people who put 4 or 5 stars down for this movie and wonder what they hell they were watching! By the end of the movie I was rooting for the Mexican Army to take the damn Alamo to put me out of my misery. It is an awful movie from a historical point of view, a patriot point of view, an action fan point of view, a movie lover point of view, and pretty much any other point of view you can come up with. I understand people are entitled to their opinion, but good lord, giving this piece of garbage anything more than the one star it so eagerly worked for is ridiculous. I can only assume these are the same people who loved Cop Out."
2,Historical Accuracy Put in Doubt,"This version of The Alamo lost its claim to historical accuracy when its set designer failed to locate the Alamo Chapel the proper position to the Convent/Long Barracks building. A quick trip to San Antonio with measuring tools would have prevented this unacceptable error.Getting it right is important in this historical movie. In many cases, it is likely ""right on"", but the glaring error described above ruined it for me. That error casts doubt on all other historically debatable topics presented in the film.Another part that bothers me has to do with the time of the final battle. Although the battle likely started at dawn, I do not feel the entire battle would have been conducted in the dark. Why? Too hard to control troop movements, Too easy to shoot your own people.Final thoughts: Too bad, could have been a much better film. What if John Wayne would have had the special effects capabilities this director had?"
1,trash,"there is a reason ronny howard backed out of this film, how can u make a movie like this with a pg rating, incredible"
5,Perfect Fit!,"I couldn't be happier with these shoes. I have worn them for about a month, and they are nice and broke in after being on my feet all day every day. I have a pretty wide foot, and this is the only pair that doesn't put a beating on my feet throughout the day. They look great, and are pretty simple to keep clean.. so you can actually look good and feel comfortable at the same time. I like that the backing around the heel is very sturdy, and there is plenty of ankle support. It almost feels like you are walking on air, which comes with most new shoes... but the feeling hasn't seemed to fade away yet! They are spot on when it comes to size, so don't worry about ordering a 1/2 size larger or smaller.... just keep in mind that they will be snug when you first get them. After the break in they will be perfect! I would absolutely recommend these shoes to anyone.."
3,Great ... but buggy.,"The idea behind this application is fantastic - mix Bryce with 3D Studio Max or any other high-end 3D app.Unfortunately, although it kind of works the way it should, being a v.1.0 product, it suffers from being very buggy. It crashes a lot - and I mean, a lot! When twisting or turning an object, it will usually start to chug slowly and then freeze and/or crash.I am currently waiting for Metacreations to post a few patches on their site to make this the product it was supposed to be. But in spite of these problems, it is great fun to use, and the interface is brilliantly designed and easy to use. If you're used to other Metacreations products, then you will be able to create nice pics in a few mins with objects you have created in the past."
3,Little disappointed,I loved Jason in Roswell and thought he was a great actor. I wasn't as in to this movie. I thought it could have been so much more but it wasn't
4,"Over Rosewell,Something new","Lots going and didn't quite undertsand the purpose of the topless,nameless odels but overall a good film and not bias because I'm a Behr fan fro the Rosewell days!"
2,Find Another Cage!,I have owned this cage for 6 months and hate it. It is mostly made of brittle plastic. The tabs that hold the top on broke the first week. It is very difficult to clean. After a few months my hamster discovered how to chew the lock of the top compartment which now has to be taped shut. At night we have to shut the hamster into the bathroom because when she runs on the treadmill it is loud enough to wake the dead.
4,convenient,"i really like the convenience of this. It does 'drip' quite a bit, it's good that it comes with a coaster."
1,No ENVY here!,I'm a Ben Stiller / Jack Black fan but this movie is terrible. I did not laugh once during the entire movie. I can not think of one positive thing to say about this movie. Avoid it at all costs. I'd have given it negative stars if I could.
1,Garbage,"This movie was horrible. It was the worst movie I have ever seen. I give it one star because it was not funny, the acting was horrible and Chirstopher Walken had his worst role yet. I would never buy or recommend this movie. The worst scene in this movie was when the whole town was going ""Where does the s*^t go"". This movie didn't have one funny scene from begining to end. I don't know why I didn't stop this movie when I was watching it. If you think this movie is good or great I don't know what your talking about. I will never rent another Jack Black or Ben Stiller movie(except Dodgeball) again. This was the worst movie I have ever scene."
4,Funny,"This movie has many funny scenes. Christopher Walken is THE funniest actor in this movie. You will want to watch it more than once because of Walken's quirky character. Cute story, Fun movie. Stiller and Jack Black are good together.Highly recommend."
1,Avoid! Avoid!,"This was the worst movie I have ever seen, hands down. All it's about is a suddenly rich guy and his jealous neighbor who accidentally kills his horse. I left the theater in a bad mood; it was so boring. I felt like I had been awake 24 hours straight. Not even worth renting."
1,this movie deserves to be vapoorized,"Just rented this movie from blockbuster and well, it sucks, big time. not funny at all, multiple subplots that amounted to nothing. Movie was super dry, super boring, actually fast forwarded through half of it and then just turned it off it was so mind numbing. save your money."
5,Funny Scifi,"I loved Lexx when it was a TV series and decided to collect the set. Some have said that the picture quality is not that good. Well, I never thought there was a problem when it aired and was watched on my old CRT TV. I find that it is not the best quality, but then again it might not have been the best quality to start with. Part of the charm for me was to watch it as I had seen it long ago."
4,A good Season,This was an interesting season full of adventure. The only thing I didn't like was that the entire season was spent on one.of two planets (fire or water) - which limited the storyline. This was also a much darker season than the first two.
3,"Fun, Sweet Music","this record is adorable. not too sweet, but just catchy enough to excite the indie-rock lover in everyone."
4,PERFECT indie pop!,"I stumbled upon this CD (and the band) after I saw the music video for ""Speak Slow"" one late night on VH1. And boy was I glad I did!Almost every single song is pure pop bliss, just hook after hook after hook. And that's what it is: pop. Amazon suggest ""punk-pop"" as a tag, but that couldn't be further from the truth... Most songs are pretty upbeat or kind of mellow. The girls are just simply great songwriters, at least based on this CD. My favorites are ""You Wouldn't Like Me"", ""Take Me Anywhere"", ""I Know..."", ""Where Does The Good Go"" and ""Wake Up Exhausted"".Their ultra-nasal and throaty voices are of acquired taste, much like jazz pianist Keith Jarrett's warbling and moaning, but I don't mind them, as long as the music's this good."
1,black/brown belt,The article came damaged and later than expected. It was to be a gift so I didn't have time to exchange item and was upset with this. It looked to be worn and very damaged.
2,smaller than it looks,This thing is a lot smaller than the looks on the internet. I wear a small in wemons and bought a medium and it was still too small. BUY 2 SIZES BIGGER THAN YOU NEED. its poor quality too.
1,Thank goodness this is off the air,The entire concept of the show is a very bad Sporanos rip off on either a much lower budget or just sheer production incompetence. The dialogue is atrocious and the characters predictable and flat. What the actors do to compensate for the poor script is to overact turning every episode into a very painful ordeal.Thank goodness this is off the air.
4,KING PIN is worth watchiing,King Pin is a violent take on the leaders if a mexican drug cartel. Alot here call it Mexican Sopranos and thats a fair analogy. This was the only season of the show and When you view it like I did over a couople of days You kinda wish there was more . The fact there wasnt means NBC gave up on this series before the audiences found it . It would of been better served on a cable station like HBO but NBC gave this one good actors and nice production values. Plot was good and full of violence and sex and of course Family ties. Take a peek at this if you like the topic and You will likely be pleased. Overall...thumbs UP
5,Kelly's Rockn On!,"Can you ask for a better movie? If you were too young to see Chicago but love musicals, this is perfect! I saw it opening day and fell in love with the movie! Please, if you haven't seen it, hurry! It's the best movie and if you loved American Idol, or if you just want a fun movie to remind you of summer, buy this movie! You won't regret it! Trust me!"
2,"Justin's a Girl, Kelly's a Man","Is it just me, or does Justin look more like a girl than Kelly does. Weird."
4,"A Charming, Fun Movie","I was very surprised how good this movie was. I wasn't expecting too much, I thought it would be a marketing hype with everyone making more money off of Justin and Kelly. Which it is... and yet, I was very entertained. I loved the music and the dancing. It was all very light hearted and very fun. It reminded me of the old Annette Funicello - Frankie Avalon movies. I thought Justin and Kelly did an excellent job. Amazing, a year ago, these kids were just ordinary kids. Today, movie stars. This was a very charming movie."
2,Not the best,"The words to describe this movie are pointless, bad, nosense and anything else that falls in the lame category.It isnt at all hard to see why this movie got so many bad reviews,Thsi movie is a total waste of time Go see Crossroads(with Britney Spears) or Glitter(with Mariah Carey) or even A walk to remember (Mandy Moore) or Gigli (Benifer) before watching this"
1,"Why, oh why did I rent this!!!","Ok, I was walking through the Blockbuster when I came across ""From Justin to Kelly"". I said, ""Hey, why not rent it. I would be good for a lark."" Well, let me tell you this. It was horrible, there wasn't anything good about it. Bad writing, bad acting, even worse dancing and singing. On top of that, the plot is a million miles away. The plot is a spec, practically non-existant. Why would anyone want to make a movie with Kelly, who no one gets a riff about, and Justin. Besides, how did he make second on American Idol. The man just can't sing, or act, or anything else useful. So, if you're a human being with eyes and ears and you run across this movie, step away from the aisle and run away. Very far away."
1,Worst movie EVER MADE....,"My daughter begged me to watch this movie with her.. THANK GOD we didn't buy it..I would have to say, this is the WORST MOVIE EVER made.. You tell me ONE movie that's worse than this one?? You can't.This is just the Americal Idol producers looking to make more $$$ off the Americal Idol empire..BAD ACTING... COMPLETLY BAD.. they can sing. but thats about it..This movie is NOT wholesome either, and I wouldnt let my child buy it after viewing it now.Anyone who says this movie is fantastic or great or the ""best movie"" they have ever seen, need to take a look at what a ""good"" movie is and what ""good"" acting is.. because it wasnt displayed here at all..This movie should have went RIGHT to DVD.. I'm not suprised it BOMBED in the BOX OFFICE..If only there were a 0 out of 5 star rating.."
1,C'mon-Honestly if they had paint dry I'd rather see that!,Where's the plot? Not only is this movie cheesy-it lacks one key thing. Acting talent. Kelly and Justin please stick to singing. This movie was awful and a complete waste of time and money. C'mon like anyone actually sings on a beach and all dance the same. What planet are they on?
1,I think they need to look over their ratings for this film,"i think this movie was soo stupid! if ur in the middle of a beach singing, i dont think there would be any background music! plus, even at the singing competisions, or at the end where they all were singing and dancing, there was no speakers, or anything where the background music could be coming from!! i think the movie would have been OK if it was about an acctual story, it was like a 90 min. dance, with singing! i dont think this should have been 3 1/2 star movie! think, scooby doo [the first one] got 1 1/2 stars, and it was WAY better then this, whoever rated this movie needs to b in a mental institution!! w/ advanced therapy!! freaking phsycos!!"
3,"Dance numbers were good, the script bad","This was a fun movie with Justin Guarini and Kelly Clarkson. The dance numbers were good--I wished that they made an album of the songs played in the movie. I heard about 10 different songs in there. But the script was pretty bad, mediocre in most parts. Kelly was okay, but Justin was just plain awful in most of the scenes. And the other actors were sometimes better than the main characters in the movie. I think this movie sometimes copied Where The Boys and some other summer movies a little too much. I think that the American Idol franchise should stay away from the movie business and let these singers from their competitions concentrate on their music careers. This movie flopped badly in the summer of 2003, even made Justin Guarini's album sell so very slow."
1,From butthole to comode.,I enjoyed the bowel movement I had taken in the middle of watching this movie more than the first half of the movie. The second half of the movie I spent sitting on the toilet. With my own personal experience I have found tremendous success with this movie and its highly effective internal cleansing properties.
1,I WANT MY TIME BACK!!!!!!!!,"I'd heard this movie was bad, so when I found it in the bargain rack, I just had to buy it. I thought, what the hey, maybe it will become a cult classic bad movie! Maybe I will laugh til my eyes pop out! No such luck--it was painful. Predictable story line, hideous directing, dreadful acting, unbelievably horrid costuming--need I say more? I kept looking at the time on the screen---WHEN WILL IT END????!!!! On the flip side, what could John Waters or Tim Burton have done with this one? Either one of them could have made it a cult classic! I don't care about the few bucks I dropped on it, but I wish I had the hour and 17 minutes of my life back! The producer and director should be FINED for having the audacity to thrust this movie on the public!"
1,I didn't see the movie but.....,They made this movie because Kelly N Justin were popular on American Idol and they just wanted to make more money on them........ I knew it would be stupid and obviously everyone thinks that..... About....I mean the people that....watch movies that arent rated G<>No offense to Justin and kelly tho
1,reallly bad,I rented this game and it is just plain really bad. The graphics are not that good and the gameplay is a joke. Look elsewhere for a good time.
1,CART (not so FURY) Championship Racing,"I race cars, this game doesn't know what racing is. I enjoy true to life simulation. This game had no simulation. I have always enjoyed Gran Turismo, NASCAR and Grand Prix games...But this one just wasn't what I expected especially since it is on a platform that could do so much more."
1,this game [is bad],save your money and buy a real racing game.. TURBO BOOST? SUPER BOOST? what a jip!
1,DON'T BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"YHIS GAME IS THE WORST RACING GAME I HAVE EVER PLAYED. I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE AND BEGGED FOR MY MONEY BACK AFTER TWO MINUTES OF GAME PLAY. THE CAR BOUNCES AROUND TRACK AS IF IT HAD BIG BALLOON TIRES, AND YOU INSTANTLY LOOSE CONTROL IF YOU LET OFF THE GAS. WHEN YOU CRASH, THE CAR EXPLODES AS IF IT WERE MADE OF GLASS. THERE IS ABSOLUTLY NO REALISM IN THIS GAME, EVEN IN SIMULATION MODE. I'M A BIG CART FAN AND THIS GAME IS INSULTING TO PLAY FOR THOSE OF US WHO EXPECT REALISTIC RACING. THIS GAME IS NOT WORTHY OF THE ONE STAR I GAVE IT , BUT THAT IS THE LOWEST I COULD GO. IF YOU SEE THIS GAME ON THE SHELF, JUST LAUGH AND WALK AWAY."
1,Truly AWFUL! Another one for the hall of shame!,There's little middle ground when it comes to deciding whats good and whats bad on the PS2 these days. (...) This ones right up there next to Capcom vs SNK2.Dont buy it. Unless you're under 12. And even then go buy GT3 and grow up frustrated forever!
2,Frustrating Game,"This game started out fun enough. It was only my second racing game (the first being Moto GP) and I thought I was missing something. It turns out that it was the game that was missing something. The earlier tracks are easy enough but as you go up they become increasingly difficult until there is little more involved then sheer luck and even that doesn't work. Cars crash and this is about the only way you can move up in the posistions. There are only a few songs and they rapidly become annoying. The effects are nothing special and the cars fly apart in large chunks, all in all it's not very thrilling. The hidden bonus cars are fairly ridiculious and a few even make it difficult to drive because you can't see the track as they are so big, there's actually a car in the shape of a big spider (legs and all). This was a pretty disappointing game."
1,Terrible way to end a carrer.,"I totaly agree with the first review....that album realy sucks.I try to hear it many times,but its simply impossible.The Arrangements is so poor and out of date.Try any other Graces' album except that."
3,Grace at the end her corporate ropes......,"I always look forward to anything Grace Jones whips up but this collectionjust lacked her usual energy and production quality. Maybe it was thetimes, the late 80's were starting to move away from the fun and creativity that brought out the likes of Jones' work earlier in the decade andI'm sure Grace was trying to do new things and work with different musicans, but most of these cuts didn'tdo much for me,( I did like some of the remixes) I enjoyed ""On my way"", ""Love on top of love"", Amado Mio"",and the first cut was fun, ""Driving Satisfaction"", but Grace is a talentedperformance artist who is not part of the assembly line of singers, shefloats on her own boat, she's all over the place with sound and visionto spear, this just didn't come over as it should. Move ahead 19 yearsand here comes HURRICANE, more like the Grace we all know she can be."
1,Im so disappointed,"I was so excited to listen to this one. I love everything Mr. Kellerman has ever written, and hers are okay, so I thought this book was going to be fantastic.I wasn't prepared for the first book to abruptly end like it did, and was still waiting for the two stories to link together when I realized I was on to a completely different book. Maybe I didn't read the jacket cover correctly or something, who knows. I feel guilty for saying so, but in this case, they should not have written together. Sorry guys."
2,Insipid as dishwater,"To steal a line from one of the novelets. Just plain lame is another expression that comes to mind. Listening to these (audio book) reminded me of watching a 1 hour murder mystery on TV. Shallow, predictable, only interesting enough to barely keep me from hitting the STOP button.I like both of these authors so the only thing I can figure is they got stoned together one Saturday afternoon and beat out these stories in an hour or so each.Only nice thing I can say is that I borrowed the book so I didn't lose any money. I'd have been torqued had I actually bought it."
2,unabridged audiobook-Double Homicide,"I, too am a fan of Faye Kellerman's. I like that she can form and tell a story without the excessive use of profanity. Her writing is such that I often will read, and then at a later time, re-read/re-listen to her books. I liked the story revolving around the basketball college star. However, I was caught off guard by the second story. I listened to the unabridged audiobook. The second Santa Fe location story is not as captivating. I was immediately captivated by just an excerpt of the basketball themed story. However, disappointed with the Santa Fe location story. I hope the Kellermans do not continue with this type of twin novel approach."
3,Murder in two cities,"This is a two for one book..you turn it upside down and begin book 2 from the other end. Both stories are quick reads and both are murder mysteries, one set in Santa Fe and the other in Boston. In the Santa Fe book, Detectives Darrel Two Moons and Steve Katz investigate the murder of man about town and gallery owner Larry Olafson, who was found, in his gallery, with his head bashed in. In the second story, Detectives Dorothy Breton and Michael McCain are presented with the case of the basketball star who is shot dead after a match where a flagrant foul leads to massive ill feeling between the teams. Neither story is a masterpiece, both ending abruptly, leaving the reader to sort out the clues for themselves. These short stories are not my preferred reading."
2,"Double Homicide, Double Disappointment","I have read many of both Faye Kellerman's Decker books and also Jonathon Kellerman's Delaware series. I have really enjoyed books by both authors but this attempt together was really a disappointment. It lacked the mystery, adventure and just plain old human interest story that their books written individually contain. I hope that they return to what they know best in the future and don't attempt any further ""togetherness"" in their writing. In my opinion, not worth what I paid for the book."
5,Really slick show,Las Vegas is a really entertaining show.The girls are deadly and the lads are really cool.James Caan is still at the top of his game (continuing from the godfather in 1972)and his character is so powerful cool. THe father - son type of relationship between 'Danny and Ed' fits really well with seris.Its good because the show can be really intense at times and then it can have a great sense of humour between the characters. Also the action in casino on a daily basis makes the life of Las Vegas Security so exciting than i presume it really is...I can't wait for this show to come back on telly coz its deadly and is so adictive.
4,A Resource Book for Senior Girl Scouts,"This book is a must for Cadette Girl Scouts who are bridging to Seniors, girls joining as Senior Girl Scouts, or Senior Girl Scout troop leaders. It includes information about contemporary issues, careers, college admission, staying healthy, leadership, wider opportunities (worldwide sponsored activities by councils or the World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts [WAGGGS]). It also includes information about the Girl Scout Gold Award, the highest award in Girl Scouting (equivalent of the Eagle Scout for boys), as well as its requirements- a 50 hour service project, 30 hours of leadership, 4 Interest Projects (badges), the Senior Challenge, and the Career Exploration Pin. I find this book extremely useful in finding needed information about Girl Scouting. This book goes hand-in-hand with Interest Projects for Cadette and Senior Girl Scouts."
5,kept safe with this seat in an accident,"I highly recommend the Graco Safeseat as it kept my (at the time) 11-week old son safe and undamaged when our little family was in a recent car accident. We were hit by a truck that slid through a red light and spun us, and then the forse drove us into a tree. I had the Graco Soho Safeseat when the accident occurred. We replaced the Soho with the Ionic after the accident- of the same Graco line. My son was crying and screaming- but he was uninjured and I feel safest now sticking with Graco."
5,"Beautiful comb, substantial weight",If you like quality you will love this comb. It is attractive and feels substantial for the size. Bear in mind that this is the pocket comb and designed to fit in your purse. The detangling comb and others in the line are much larger.If you believe a comb is a comb then don't spend the extra money but if you are looking for something you will enjoy pulling out of your purse then this is for you.(If you look at my other reviews you'll see they are mostly 5 stars but this is because I only review things I really like or really hate.)
3,mislabled,This part is advertised as a center link tie rod end. It fits perfectly on the outer left as the closest part to the tire. An outer tie rod end is a much more appropriate description and it works great for that.
5,very pleased,"i was amazed how fast this item was shipped and the quality is good. with the christmas season in full swing, this came within a week."
1,Worthless,"I found this book totally disappointing. The advice is obvious even to inexperienced party planners. (For example, in the chapter on invitations there is a section on ink color that states only: ""There are many colors to consider."") Most of the book consists of lined pages for you to write your price comparisons for vendors, such as photographers. There are 20 pages lined for you to fill in guest addresses, with little boxes to check off if you have written a thank you note. My copy of this book is going straight into the recycling pile."
4,good product bad mail cost,"it is good product as toshiba name and the flash itselt nice , but it cost me almost $16.00 dollars just for shiping, so, it cost me togather $52+"
1,SENT THE WRONG ITEM,"The wrong item was shipped. I ordered the bead set, and I received a far inferior product. It was from SHUR, but it was far cheaper. If it was a replacement for the item because they were out of stock, they should have upgraded. Instead I got an expensive ""How to Bead"" book."
4,SaltAire,"I've been a sinuse sufferer for many years.SaltAire has worked wonders for me.Use it in the morning if I feel stuffy,then I'mgood all day. Just wish it was a little less expensive."
4,Very good story,"I have two complaints about this book...first, I got very little sleep because it was hard to put down, and second, it ended. Great writing, lots if action. I thoroughly enjoyed it."
1,DON'T BUY IF USING ATV FOR MULTIPLE PURPOSES!,"This system works, but it does NOT install and uninstall easily. You need a hammer and a long bolt to take the pins out. I bought this thinking I could use my ATV to plow and ice-fish. I would need to remove it to use my ATV for ice fishing, and it DOES NOT remove easy. Having it on your ATV removes a good amount of ground clearance. Lucklily, I am able to return it."
5,Vital Tool for Teaching Upper Level High School or College Latin,"I use this book for my upper-level Latin students. Not only do they enjoy translating texts they recognize, but the Latin is challenging enough to provide ""teachable moments"". It encompasses all of the grammar/syntax rules my students have learned throughout the years, and then helps them to apply these rules. I recommend this text to anyone teaching (or self-teaching) Latin!"
3,House on Mango Street,"After reading House on Mango Street, I had the impression that Esperanza dreamt of leaving Mango Street but in the end she really never did actually but just said she would in the future. It was reasonable why she couldn't leave because of her family and working status however I felt it was repetitive when she said she hated the place and yearned to leave. I agree with the other reviewer Karen that Esperanza complained too much about her life that it had become annoying. However reading about the characters were very interesting because they all had good descriptions about their personalities and there was humor about their lives as well. Over all this book was interesting to read and I have learned a lot about women and their different relationships with their families and husbands and the how their lives dramatically change once they get married."
2,ok,"The House On Mango Street written by Sandra Ciserno, it is a bunch of short stories or vignette. The whole story describes the thoughts, feelings, and memories of Esperanza, a hispanic girl living in the poor area of Chicago. She dreams to escape her world and getting a house of her own. At the same time, she grows up and starts to leave her childhood, while learning about the fears and dangers of the world she never knew of before. She finds out becoming an adult turns out to be a hard challenge.When we first started reading this book I thought it was going to be a depressing book about a family leaving in poverty. It was exactly that it did not appeal to me at all. The only thing that I enjoyed was Cisneros way of telling a story. The way she would describe some of these situations you felt you were right there with experonza. My favorite vignette was the one about how she visited her sick aunt."
3,Talk About Weird!!!,"JohnI think this story was weird it's vignettes were to small, and the vignettes were written on stupid details in life like who cares what type of hair styles her family has and who gives clouds names nobody I knows does. Her vignettes were to small and her book wasn't long enough. her titles weren't about important things in life, her point of veiw was a little girls but not every kid thinks of things she wrote about."
3,The House On Mango Street,"The House on Mango StreetThe house on Mango Street is a delightful tale about a young girl over the course of one year growing up in not the nicest naborhood. It's a story about finding yourself, inner struggle, and the tries and tribulations of growing up in a ruff naborhood .its a heart warming story about friendship, young love, and tragedy.More than anything Espranza wants to leave her new house they just moved into on Mango Street. It is the family's first house they own but it's not what Espranza expected. She wanted a house with lots of bathrooms, spacious living area, stairs, and a big yard. But what she got is a little house in a run down nabor hood.It's a wonderful story a must read."
2,The house on mango street,"The house on Mango street, personally I found a lot of this book almost confusing, it's about a girl growing up and writing diary entries, about her life and what she had done during that day ,and mainly it was just a lot of short stories. I like how this books brings us into a different life than what a lot of us know. It really takes you into the girl's life and how she thinks, it brings you into a small town of broken down homes, and in some cases broken down families. But on the down side, I found a lot of this book almost pointless, scattered and hard to follow. I think a lot of the stories in this novel where almost pointless and unnecessary. I didn't really like the novel, but I do give the author a lot of credit for coming up with a book that a lot of people in one way or another are able to relate to."
3,Disappointing Given Its Remarkably High Praise,"I like this book of vignettes about the Latino experience. My problem was that I didn't love it. Perhaps because my expectations were so high after reading some great reviews, seeing it on some lists of the best books in the last 25 years and several recommendations from friends.Cisneros certainly has great command of language and several of the vignettes are deeply engaging. My main issue with the book is that I kept wanting more. I wanted more depth about Esperanza and the other characters Cisneros introduces us throughout the vignettes.After I finished the book, I felt like I do after having a meal at a restaurant where the appetizer is delicious and then you get just an average entree. Cisneros whets your appetite but leaves you disappointment with your whole experience."
3,house on mango street,reading the book house on mango street was very intersting because every chapter was diffrent story so it kept me intersted.the main chracter Esperanza always had some negative attitude and that also kept that story interesting because i think everyone goes through that in their life time. i think this is one of book the everyone should least try to read because its not long story and i believe everyone could relate to it.
1,I Hate This Book,This book falls under the category of RL Stine. I have to read it and i hate it. It has no point and is just plain dull. I read books like this when i was in 3rd grade. It needs one of those for ages 8-9 stickers on it.
1,The House on Mango Street,I didn't really like the novel The House on Mango Street.I thought it was a boring book. I think the authors writing was good and the book was well written. I don't think the characters life is that similar to mine. I don't go running around in gardens playing in junk cars. I would reccomend this book to others because they might have a different opinion about the book than others. They might actually like it.
3,The House on Mango Street,"I thought that the book ""The House on mango Street"" was a pretty good. I thought it was good because it was written in a way that the youth could relate to and understand. I thought that the way ""Esperanza"" wrote the book was very different and interesting, but yet it was still good and easy to read. I thought that the lives of the characters that lived on Mango Street were very interesting and yet their situations were very true. You could relate a little to what they were going through. You couldn't relate in the way that the things that happened to them happened to you, but you could relate in the way that you knew what they were feeling and thinking.I thought that the book was an incite into a Latin American culture, and what it was like to live in a poorer section of the city. It also showed what it was like for people that were a minority and what they had to go through and live in to try to give their children a better life."
3,The House on Mango Street,"The House on Mango Street was a very entertaining book to read. Sandra Cisneros wrote the book in an interesting fashion, she wrote each chapter like a short story. This different way of writing a book may not be familiar to most people. There is not plot to this book either, which can make reading the book a little strange. Other wise, it shows the Hispanic culture and teaches the reader about prejudice. There isn't a very rich vocabulary in the book which makes it an quick and easy read. I rated it three stars because it was a fun book to read, but it was not challenging and I prefer to read books with a plot."
4,The greatest book in the world,The house on mango street is the best book i read because it tells the every day life of people and how it effects them. This book is about a girl who moves around alot and wished for the best house to move in. The girl and her family is waiting for the right house. When her family decided the house she disliked the house. The reason she disliked the house is beacause it was only one bedroom for six people. After reading the book the words were so discriptive that I knew it was hard moving around the house. I didn't underestand why how it was a house. After reading a couple of paragraphs I see that the girl thinks that her house is a nightmare.
1,This book was terrible!,"I didn't like it at all, I mean, who has time to read a book with a lot of incomplete storie in it, and not even a point. she should elaborate on the stories, and make the book a book of short COMPLETE stories, and then it would be worth paying for."
1,Ugh...,"We have just finished reading A House on Mango Street in my English class, and I did not like it at all. I thought the book had no plot at all, and it seemed almost unfinished. Esperanza seemed a little immature and too innoncent for a 7th grader that lives in the ghetto of Chicago. Each chapter is an average of 2 pages, and each is a totally different story. I could not follow the plot at all, if there was even a plot. The characters are undeveloped and I didn't find any main theme throughout the book except that Esperanza wants to get out of Mango Street, and she will eventually come back because that's where her home is. (?) I would expect that someone *wouldn't* go back if they didn't like it there.Overall, I was not at all impressed with the book, and I do not recommend it."
2,Not our type of a book!,This book is not good for young children to read. I did not understand what is was talking about. Also the book is hard to follow. The book dosen't need to jump from on thing to another. I think this book should be ban from School librarys as soon as possible. I hope that after reading this book you might understand why I dont not like tis book. But maybe for older kids who are smart might understand.
3,Thought-Provoking,"This was book is a good read, but definitely not one of those can't-put-it down thrillers. It presents a plot that mingles with the issues of growing up in strong monoracial surroundings.I give respect to its representation of the importance and influences of culture in such situations, and how these same influences lead to problematic circumstances. Throughout its vignettes, Cisneros portrays a character that is constantly in query and contest with her surroundings as she grasps understanding of the world around her.In summary, the book will, at best, make you take a moment to examine how the world of Mango Street is much like yours. This book definitely provides insight into how the world works, but will offer nothing when it comes to changing it. It is interesting and quick, but if you looking for excitement, you may want to take a gander at those Harry Potter books..."
4,a fave,"this book is absolutely beautiful. while it is a young adult book, i believe anyone can enjoy it. there is a plot and story, but it is so entrenched in poetic language that each chapter could be read by itself as a poem. if you like latin poetry, read this book."
5,Still sticks with me 16 years later after first reading it...,I read this in college when my best friend gave it to me and I still have never read anything quite like it. I woudld recommend this to young adults and adults alike.
3,It was a good Book,I thought this was a good book...except the fact that it had way too many vignettes that didnt have anything to do with the story. It appealed to me to see the way of life through someone elses eyes..and their aspects on life
1,its bad,This book is very bad. It's extremley boring and put me to sleep. In other words don't read it.
3,Mitchs Review,"I read the book called ""The House on Mango Street""The book was about a little girl called Esperanza and her family. The book talks about how her and her family moves from there old house to a house on Mango Street, this house was the first house they owned. As the book goes on it gets harder to follow. It skips around like she would write in her diary. The only thing that she really seems to talk about a lot is the fact that she lives in poor house. Otherwise it was a pretty good book.I give this book a 6 out of 10 rating"
3,The House on Mango Street,"This book was not as good as I had expected. Things I did like is it was cool how Sandra Cisneros wrote through the eyes of a child. It showed how more difficult it is for a child than for an adult to live in a dangerous neighborhood. I liked how the chapters were short. Some things I did not like is that it is confusing to know who is talking. There was not any quotation marks to tell if a person is talking or not. It was hard to understand because the story kept on jumping around. When I read it more carefully, I kind of understood the story. Each chapter had a different part of Esperanza's life but some of the chapters were just about people in the neighborhood, peoples hair and hips, and other boring things. The book was not as good from the beginning to the middle but the end was pretty interesting. I might recommend this book if you like this author or like reading vignettes."
1,This moderatley interesting novel settles for boredom.,"The only reason this book is not a ""1"" is because of good grammar. Otherwise this pathetic novel was written to bore its reader to sleep at night. And let me say it works. I sleep like a baby now. In the future, Cisneros, you boring author, please try to be original and write something worth at least reading a page into. Shame on you!!"
4,Wake up!,"The House on Mango Street is a powerful book and a story worth remembering. Those who criticize the use of a ""child's"" voice in cunjunction with some adult themes need to wake up. Remember Calvin and Hobbes, that great comic strip from the Eighties and Nineties? Calvin often dealt with themes and used language that were far beyond his years, and he was only seven! I'm and English major and have just completed a literary analysis of this book. Even I didn't like it at first, but by looking deeper into the text I realized how superb a writer Cisneros really is. She is a feminist, however she is not a man-hater, or at least not one without reason. Read the book. Think about what Esperanza goes through. Those who don't like it or don't understand the deeper meanings behind the simple stories need to pick their copy up out of the garbage and give it an honest and educated second read, without bias. The results will surprise you, I promise."
5,An exelent piece of work,"The house on mango street is an execptional book of literature that inspired me to judge a person differently.A poor girl who has moved from place to place trying to find a life of her own life.A person who talks about her life and how her life.she talks about her family and about her friends and about her way of life.The way that she uses literary elements such as personification,simile,methaphor and dramatic irony to show her way of life is astrophonmonminal."
3,The House on Mango Street Review,"The House on Mango Street was a simple book to read, but reflected every day life. The characters were in some ways like I'am, such as when it comes to my views on friendship, life, and love. The reading was easy for me so I felt more comfortable. There was no hard words to destract me from getting into the story. I liked the way the story was so descriptive with the characters. I got good mental images which makes it eaiser for me to understand the book. I would recommend this book to people, many of my friends are like me so I believe they will enjoy it as much as I did."
4,"""The House on Mango Street""; an odd, but good book.","The story ""The House on Mango Street"" by Sandra Cisneros is an odd, but good book. This book is written in a very different way. It is not written where there are chapters that describe an order of events. Instead this book contains many small chapters, or vignettes, that are a story in their own. They describe one subject and then the next chapter is something different. This confuses you a little, but by the end of the story everything starts fitting together. This makes it a very good book. While a person reads it they might get a little confused and not like the story, but by the end the reader will understand everything and will love this book.Fodor"
4,The great book to read,"The house on mango street is a great book because it has many things that people deal with today. The book was great it shows you the point of view from a teen age girl. Her style is great because she showed and telled what the characters were feeling at the time. The one chapter where she gets rape. Thats the part that hit me the hardest. A girl getting rape shouldn't happen to any woman, but it happens. She was not proud to tell or show where she lived they're just ashameded. I will tell someone to read this book."
3,The House on Mango Street- a journey to finding yourself,"The book began with Esperanza (the narrator)telling of what her house was like, and how others before them had been. You discover that she is not very excited to be moving to her new house, it was not what she had expected at all. She goes on to tell you all about the people and things that go on in and around her life. The point of view is good, it is a child talking and there is a certain aspect that a child has, they are not afraid to come right out and say antything. This makes the story very interesting. She gives her viewpoints and you get a glimpse of what life is like in a Hispanic neighborhood. The book touches on issues such as race, abuse, and discrimination, yet it all boils down to a girl who is trying to figure out what she really wants from life, and how she wants to make a difference in hers."
1,Mr. Negative's review of The House on Mango Street,"_The House on Mango Street_Words cannot describe this book. Oh wait, I have one, ""BLOWS"". This book blows. Halfway through the book I was hoping the girl would commit suicide and the other half of the book would be blank pages. How these pointless ebonic passages became a book I will never find out. I would rather stratle a barbed wire fence then read this book again."
2,Wouldn't recommend,"This book was a very quick read. I was expecting something more like Grand Avenue or The Bluest Eye, but was rather disappointed."
3,Not Until the End...,"At first, I really did not like this book. When my teacher explained that the chapters didn't necessarily go with the one before it, I thought it must not be very good. I didn't seem understand the jumble of stories. It wasn't an effective style of writing to catch my attention right away. I really think you must read it all the way through to understand the style. When I read the last couple of vignettes I really got into it. Esperanza seemed to grow up very quickly in the last couple of pages. I think I really became interested during the ""Red Clowns"" vignette. Esperanza became more of a real person to me, with more feelings and actions. The writing of the book was more grown-up. Up until then things were depicted in ""the eyes of a child."" It just seemed to blossom."
2,The book is written in a boring kids point of view,"DavidI believe that House on Mango Street is highly overrated. The annoying writing is enough to make you stop reading the book. Out of all the great writers out there this is not one of them. I believe some younger readers would like the book, but for kids fifteen or older don't pick this book up. There are many more books worth reading instead of this one."
1,Talk about boring!,"As I picked up the novel I was quite excited to be readinbg it, but once I started I was confused and bored. With vignettes that make almost no sense. Each one a different subject that seemed so phony and stupid. Cisceneros delivers quite bland plots for the stories that never seem to take off. The novel portays a Latino family and their community. But the stories are so obvious. I strongly recommend you stay away from this book."
2,Well . . .,"This was an OK book. I didn't really like it at all, BUT you have to give the author credit for trying. I'm not a fan of ""between the lines"" reading. But it did provide some good laughs for our class, as the teacher and everyone else saw it. The red clowns section was strange."
1,It didn't make much sense to me,"I borrowed this book from the library expecting it to be a good read, considering the fact that so many people found it unique and everything. But I found it a little bit too unique; I didn't really understand anything. Each chapter was really short and was about something completely different from the others, and it was just confusing to me. If you want a good, real story about a young girl's coming of age, read ""A Tree Grows in Brooklyn"" by Betty Smith instead. ""The House on Mango Street"" was boring."
1,Revulsion,"The popularity of this book perfectly represents the apex of a society whose only real values are the desire to include minority writers i.e diversity over quality. As a moron before said that in this book you need to read between the lined, it is impossible to read between the lines in this book which is essentialy a novel for the telvision age. A series of vignettes connected by nothing except schools' desire to buy a book by a minority author. In fact this literary window shopping is just another form of racism. Because the publishers of the book are simply adopting any Hispanic writer. This bias demeans the excellent Hispanic writers such as Lorca, Marquez and Cervantes. As an educated person, I deeply object to this broad prejudice against minorities."
1,If this book had a story it would be great,"The House on Mango Street is a collection of short stories told to you by a twelve year old getto girl. Each story is about a facet of getto life, which made it hard to for me, a middle class male, to relate to. The short length of the stories didn't help much ether. Because there was no time to build a setting the stories made you feel as if you are reading an MTV music video. Of course, all these shortfalls could be forgiven if the book had any character development at all, but sadly, the characters reminded me of cardboard cut-outs in theaters."
1,Any street,While I believe anyone who grew up in any large city could appreciate an occasional anecdotal quip...over and over and over again in the authors self-absorbed babytalk squeaking was enough to drive me to the garbage can with this audio book! I won't ever forget to play an example of a selection before being sentenced to another audiobook.
2,"Looking the ""Killswitch"" Howard Jones? Don't look here!","BHBS is a good band. They have some heavy music and fits the genre perfectly. I was recommended to them because I am a huge fan of Killswitch Engage. Howard has an amazing voice on ""The End of Heartache"" and I wanted more. Why not try his other band?<br />The thing is, he gargles a lot on this CD, not so much singing and melodic screaming. It basically sounds a lot like Napalm Death or something. I was hoping for the Howard I already knew, but I got something completely different.<br />The music is good, but this review is just a warning to fans look for more Howard--Don't look here if you're expecting the same ol' Howard."
3,INTERESTING,"This book is well-written but not really a ""feel good"" book. An interesting family with an interesting story and an interesting cast of characters."
5,Extraordinary,This was one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. I identify completly with Gilbert and his plights. Sad and funny this I belive is now my favorite book. Bravo Mr. Hedges
5,A treasure from east-europe,"This is a rare one, difficult to describe or classify. A masterpiece of beauty and delicacy from two musicians (and lots of guests) who really know what they're doing. As I see it, for all tastes and ages. This beautiful box has a special place in my collection."
5,How did the corner drug store evolve?,For those wondering about how we have developed our modern pharmacy retail this is a great book to start with. It shows how the downtowns and suburbs evolved over Walgreens long history. You can see the importance of the pharmacist in American life by watching the growth of this spectacular company. Although I would have like a little more time spent on where the future lies in this business and whether the corner drug store will continue to thrive this is a great book. For those looking for an introduction into retail pharmacy this is a great start.
3,Romantic Radiohead?,"After hearing O'Riley on NPR talking about his love of classical music, and his obsession with Radiohead, it seemed like this would be a delightful, insightful meeting of musical minds. Not so, alas! These are romanticized arrangements which make hash of the subtlety and suggestive layering that make Radiohead's music so appealing to me, a classical music maniac. Although much of the disc is pleasant, it would not be out of place in the Windham Hill or Narada catalogs. Sometimes, O'Riley resorts to plain old, ham-handed emoting. There may still be an interesting instrumental redaction of Radiohead's music to be made, but I suspect it might almost have to be an acoustic/electronic hybrid, a la one of those Budd/Eno collaborations of the 80's. This disc might appeal to those solidly in the musical middle of the road, not to hard core classical or Radiohead fans."
1,Missing the main ingredient,"Radiohead has a sensibility that is totally absent from any of this music recorded by the earnest O'Riley. Naturally there arethose who can appreciate this cd based solely on its pianistic values, but one is forced to listen to the music by trying to forget that it is 'Radiohead' music. Sort of like playing a Bartok piano work in the style of Chopin: It might sound fine asChopin, but not as Bartok. Radiohead's music works as a total sound, sensibility and lyrical package, not simply as melodies alone."
2,When Barrie created PETER PAN....,"...he was reacting to the current theatrical scene in London. He was tired of writing melodramatic, chauvinist, manipulative, and overly-sentimental plays. PETER PAN was brilliant and revolutionary because it was fantastic, escapist and playful. Unfortunately this film is almost EXACTLY what Barrie deplored! It is melodramatic, predictable, chauvinist, and maudlin. The acting is quite good, but Depp has done similiar work far too many times. He is a terrific actor but he should explore new territory.One scene does stand out: the creation of PETER PAN on stage. The audience's reaction tells all: they are either astounded, reviled, but never unmoved."
3,"Nice little film, Depp is great","But Winslet and Christie are definitely in roles that could have been better written. Winslet exists just to chase kids and get sick, and there must have been more to the relationship between her character and Depp's than that. But it's a nice family film, even if a bit slow for the younger kids."
2,WHERE WAS MICHAEL JACKSON?,"This movie might have held my attention more,if Michael Jackson were in it. I found mostof the movie to be uninteresting. I had toturn on the subtitles, to understand whateveryone was saying. Another disappointingoverhyped movie! Worth seeing once, I guess."
4,good film,"Johnny Depp,Kate Winslet&Dustin Hoffman all give good solid Performances in this film.the pacing of the film takes a while before things truly kick into gear. but the acting is what truly makes this film. the film takes on many themes&you are watching everything unfold.this was a good film with even better Acting."
2,Didactic. Bad Film.,I don't think anything about this film really gets going. I don't blame Winslet or Depp but I blame the director. The direction was like a poor salesman's incongruent speech before sale. It just didn't do anything for me. I wasn't touched. Not impressed. I don't even remember scenes. One of the most forgettable films I've seen.
5,Unexpected blessing,"In the past 18 months, our family lost 4 members. This movie handles a difficult subject with warmth, honesty & insight. It is also an interesting portrayal of a beloved author's life. I highly recommend Finding Neverland."
1,BOOOOORING....AND CREEPY!,A GROWN MAN WHO WOULD RATHER HANG WITH SOMEONE ELSES CHILDREN INSTEAD OF HIS BEAUTIFUL WIFE....CREEPY CREEPY CREEPY.OH YA THIS THING WAS INSANELY BORING TOO.
5,Stellar Moviemaking,"When it comes to The Academy Awards, I would be hard-pressed to find a more deserving movie for as many awards as Finding Neverland. Adapted Screenplay (from the original play), Costume Design, Original Music Score, Best Picture, and Best Actor are all potential winning categories for this gem of a movie (although I do like Sideways for Best Picture and Jamie Foxx for Best Actor, however).I vehemently feel that Kate Winslet was slighted by The Academy Awards after not being nominated for her amazingly mesmerizing performance as the widowed Sylvia Llewelyn Davies. She was, in my opinion, even better than she was in her nominated role from Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. In any event, Finding Neverland is anything but devoid of sublime acting from all involved. Depp is equally impressive as enigmatic playwright J.M. Barrie. All in all, one of the year's best -- period."
3,Mayhem and Chaos Amongst the Law and Lawless!,"Good show! This low budget unknown is quite good. Vigilantes set out to rid Melbourne of dealers and frustrate police from the get-go. Brutal murder after murder, with the intent of gaining a hoard of followers, the Ravor Eaters create chaos and mayhem to shake up the law and the lawless. I only gave it a three because of the lack of sound quality. It was already difficult trying to sustain the Aussies diction, but when it's muffled, it's almost a silent picture. It's definitely worth a look. I enjoyed it. And I loved the ending."
5,Toy I always wanted,It was in good condition no flaws! I have it still in the box. I was in to transformers as a kid and still am . I want to collect all the transformers I never got as a kid
5,THE BEST MOVIE IN THE WORLD,"I LOVE THIS Movie so much!!it is so funny, smart and entertaining!Please go see it! you won't regret it!the two main stars are sizzling!!AHH!"
4,"A Clever, Although Unrealistic Film","The Girl Next door is about an ex-porn star who moves next door to a nerdy high school student. He becomes immediately infatuated with her, and she develops an attraction to him. His innocent life clashes with the hardened lifestyle she has acquired within the porn industry. He gets conned by her pimp-like producer. In the end, he fights back and wins the girl. Overall, this is a cute and cleverly written film. Elisha Cuthbert comes across as a good match for Emile Hirsch. Unfortunately, she's just not credible as a porn star. Although extremely sexy, she still seems way too innocent. And the idea of a porn star developing an attraction to a nerdy high school student like Hirsch is unrealistic in itself. Still, I thought this was a fun film to watch. The story would be a fantasy come true for any young male."
2,Pass on the Movie...but check out the music,Movie was drivel but there were some excellent songs particularly David Gray's This Years Love that i was introduced to. I'm definately checking out his CD's and there were some other good songs as well. I've already totally forgotten about the movie but that song is lingering in my head.
1,completely dumb,"man, what the hell people. Dumbass movie from the word go. I know I say this but its the truth in my eyes. You got a kid whose passion is towards a girl who happens to be a porn star and thats when it goes dumb...literally. IT just spirals down into the oblivion of bad comedys and this is one of the worst of 2004. Who would of guessed Timothy Olyphant (GO, A Man Apart) and James Remar (Drugstore Cowboy, 48HRS.) in this movie? I certainly didnt until the 2 showed up on screen. You know Elisha Cuthbert is cute and all but is suffers from shear stupidity and boredom. Also starring Jacob Young (tv's All My Children), Emile Hirsch and Paul Dano (Taking Lives). Stear clear from this junk pile people...you deserve better."
3,NEXT Teen [vulgarity] Falls Limp,"THE GIRL NEXT DOOR follows in a long line of recent teen [adult content] flicks that focuses more on the bodies and less on the storylines. However, that's exactly why many of the men were in the audience in the first place. After an incredibly slow start, some laughs do eventually transpire (none of which are generated by the actual ""girl next door""). Actually, her character is used more to connect the other essential players and is almost forgotten at the end of the movie. This film barely passed the 2 star mark, but considering how bad many of the other films have been this year, it feels about average."
1,bad rip off of risky buisness,"boring plot, bad acting, bad rip off of risky buisnes, please don't waste your money or more importantly your time"
5,"Not American Pie, Not Risky Business, but stands on its own","If you're looking for the hilarious one-liners from American Pie or the steamy-greater-than-your-imagination trains scenes from Risky Business, then you're bound to be disappointed.This movie stands on its own merits. It's a telling look at growing up as a confused adolescent. It's a wild ride from start to finish. Perhaps the audience has to use its imagination to bridge some of the scenes, but it triggers deeper intellect to convey the ultimate adventure in finding out who we really are and how much effort we all take in getting to find ""it."" (Whatever ""It"" is...love, companionship, a chance in life.)Is the juice worth the squeeze? Yes, definitely. Rent this movie when you think life is in ""cruise control"" mode. We could all benefit from having a 'girl next door' in our lives."
4,A welcome change to the tried and tested format,"I'm not usually a fan of the `Teen movie' genre; at best I find them vaguely amusing and at worst painfully predictable. The Girl Next Door isn't a complete exception; we've certainly seen similar plots. However all is forgiven. It is able to pull off a `classic' teen movie plot in a wholesome, sexy, funny and uplifting way. This is achieved by some above average direction (Luke Greenfield), a good script and a superb soundtrack.(...). You may even end up liking some of these characters. (A first for me with a teen movie).This could have been quite average bit it has been nurtured with care. The Girl Next Door is able to offer us some promising new talent in the forms of Elisha Cuthbert, Emile Hirsch, Timothy Olyphant and James Remar.Good feeling presides as the credits role; I can honestly say this is a welcome change to the tried and tested format."
4,Good,"I had it on my I tune, put I lost due to reloading it! Very happy with this one! I enjoy this one!"
5,The Goddess Next Door,"I got this movie just thinking it would be another teen movie that would be good watching for a Friday nite. Boy was I wrong. Let's get this out of the way first: Elisha Cuthbert is THE Goddess! I have followed her career all the way from Popular Mechanics for Kids, through 24, and now The Girl Next Door. She's come a long way, and it's nice to see someone as beautiful and talennted as her finaly get a time to shine.Anyone who watches this movie should be suprised at the quality of it. It is not like your average teen movie, it keeps you guessing the whole way through and has a lot of twists and turns that will keep you watches (If you can take your eyes off Elisha for a second) If you are just seeing this movie for Elisha u get plenty of her, and a good story is told also. GO GET THIS MOVIE!!!"
4,Quite funny,Because this was written a long time ago modern attitudes differ widely. Can be ridiculous by modern thinking and also quite amusing!
5,Blasphemously Fast!,"this is amongst the fastes stuff i have ever heard, not for the faint of heart people who listen to Six Feet Under and Old Entombed. This is for the Morbid Angel, AngelCorpse, Nile and Cryptopsy fans. This is a death metal supergroup, comprised of Rutan (MorbidAngel) and Cerrito (ex-Suffocation). Has that low end Glen Benton feel, with few hi pitch screams, tantering on the edge of feirce black metal but staying in tune with the finest death metal. I love or(Hate?) this CD its the best deathmetal i have heard for a while. Also check out AngelCorspe, MorbidAngel, Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Deicide, Nile and Cryptopsy."
4,"Fast paced, brutal, technical death metal!","Yep -- I was definately not dissapointed here. C'mon, the two guitarists are Eric Rutan (Morbid Angel) and Doug Cerrito (Suffocation). How can't you dig this stuff, its an all-star cast. Eric rutan has a good low death metal scream that sounds really good throughout the whole album. Jared Anderson (the bassist of the band) has some cool high-pitched black-metal-ish back up vocals. The riffing on this record is EXTREMELY technical and fast. The riffs go by really fast, so that 90% of the songs are over in two minutes. Thats the only downside to this wonderful CD. Outstanding percussion courtesy of Tim Yeung and solos (obviously, we're dealing with two of death metals most influential bands!). Anyone into extreme brutal metal (ie, Morbid Angel, Suffocation, Cannibal Corpse, Cryptopsy...) BUY THIS ALBUM!!! YOU WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED!!!"
5,"you'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll kiss $ goodbye","This is a brilliant little gem of a book. Sublimely simple, hilariously clever, every one of the sparse words is perfectly placed. The crude drawings are funny & apt. Together, this teeny story of bivalve enlightenment will make you laugh out loud."
2,Good info but not much of it. Misleading title.,"There are lot's of great tips as mentioned by other reviewers, but ""Beginner"" in the title definitely refers to experienced artists who want to learn about cartoons. Like most of Hart's books, each page is taken up almost entirely by large drawings with very little explanation. This may seem to make sense considering the subject matter, but the degree to which it is done is excessive and is actually just a way to blow up a booklet into a book. If several books from Hart's series were combined into one, it might approach the value of other non-cartoon drawing books I've been using that are just as insightful and provide much more information."
3,"Part travelogue, part political promotion of gay life","The book is well-written, somewhat interesting; but, if one is not a member of the art/single/pro-gay community, then one might find it a bit of a bore... having to, yet again, read about the superior qualities of the freer/more-truly-human, gay/art/single lifestyle. For example, in this book, traditional adults (married with children) have to struggle with the maintenance of their unruly kids... Homosexual parents have well-behaved and interesting children. One does wonder why it is that these clearly superior people allow sexual drives to predominate their everyday thoughts and behavior."
5,"The Beach Got ""Heat ! ""","This album is hot ! What a great idea for an album. Every unsigned artists should want to get there hands on this. We all should buy this one. I hear why it is called ""Hidden Hits."" Score one for the unsigned artists. I hope there is a Volume 2. Maybe I can get on !"
4,Creative and different,"I'm on my second copy now, having lost the first one. This is great stuff for those who like the new generation of modern jazz artists who are evolving the post-bop tradition without going totally avant garde. Geri Allen is outstanding - check out her work on her own albums. Others I would recommend in this vein are Steve Lehman, Vijay Iyer, and Rudresh Mahantappa."
2,A nice product for a beginner...,"If you're a beginner and you need an easy to use product to burn CDs, then this is your product. A simple interface combined with a reliable burn, MyCD is the product for you. If you want flexibility and power (read as: If you're a power-user) then you'll want to pass this product up. I'm a power-user and found MyCD a bit too limiting for my taste. Things I found limiting: 1) You can't name a CDs volume name (!) 2) When burning MP3s->Audio CD MyCD scans the ENTIRE harddrive for audiofiles (if you have lots of files then this process could take a few minutes) and 3) Its support for CDRW drives is rather limited, best to check for compatibility before picking this software up. If you're a power-user use Nero 5.x, if you're just beginning to burn CDs then MyCD is fine for you."
3,It's OK,"The olives are salted, not fresh as advertised. However they are good and tasty.I will be looking for really fresh olives."
4,Rating and a rant,"This was a great deal! The amount of olives seems overwhelming at first glance but quickly dwindles after some divvying up with friends and a few parties. One of the varieties of olive did become mushy upon refrigeration but the others held their firmness. Now, I myself can't purchase them again because Amazon has declined to ship groceries to Alaska any longer. I really cant fathom why some companies choose to treat both Alaska & Hawaii as though we are located on another planet. If you are shipping from the west coast, it is the same amount to ship to either Alaska or the east coast. How 'bout cutting off New jersey's olive supply? I digress....buy the olives, have some for me."
5,Softer Fur,All 3 of my dogs are fairly young but giving them vitamins should help them live longer. After a week or two of giving these to my dogs I noticed their fur was much softer. So it is doing something.
5,I love this music.,"This is an album that I play over and over. I dance to it and (try) to sing to it. I love the lyrics on this album, they are mystical, intelligent, trippy, and beautiful. The lead singer's voice is strong yet vulnerable, and doesn't miss a note. I can't wait to hear what this singer does next, she is AMAZING."
4,Excellent value,This portfolio has come in very handy. It provides the tools to allow you to organize your materials and papers in an efficient manner.
5,No te puedes quedar atras!! Tienes que leer la continuación.,"Este libro es la continuacion de la serie Dejados Atras. Aqui podemos ver de una manera real como los autores nos meten en un mundo apocaliptico, al cual tu y yo bien podemos identificar. Con fundamentos biblicos y dando vida a versículos del libro de Apocalipsis, el Comando Tribulación se conforma, integrando 4 vidas que no tenian nada en comun bajo un mismo fin, encontrar las respuestas del por que han desaparacido sus seres queridos y conocidos. De seguro no podras dejar la lectura hasta terminar y salir a buscar el siguiente volumen..."
2,"Sorry, We Should be Sleeping","With great anticipation I got the third installment of DC-10's Monday Morning Club mix and am somewhat sad to say it didn't quite hold up to expectations. Then again, if you are looking for primarily mid-tempo and non-peak hour house, this could be the CD for you. The opening track is probably the best of both CD's and is a superb build up for higher energy. Unfortunately this energy never fully shows up. The second CD has little or nothing to write home about, while CD 1 does contain some satisfying bass lines and vocal tracks (Tracks 7 & 11). This Monday Morning mix is an excellent example of the maturing sound of house music in the 21st century, but probably should only be played before 11pm."
3,Raspberries short caked,"In 1972, weren't no Beatles, weren't hardly a Badfinger around, and the Top 40 needed perfect pop that brought bunches of kids swooning to melodies and dancing to daring lyrics while being chased and chaste.Raspberries fit that mold. ""Go All the Way"" was teenage naughty but not nasty, ""I Wanna Be w/You"" was aching and forecasting latter day bands like Cheap Trick Rubinoos and dare we suggest it paved the way for huge success for Lyndsey Buckingham led Fleetwood Mac a few years later...This is a fine CD of Raspberries hits and misses, LP favorites and it sounds like the echo of corderoy bell bottoms against a denim blouse."
5,Why is This listed as EXPLICIT ?,"Why are the sound samples listed as being EXPLICIT ? Not just 1 track,but ALL tracks are listed this way. I have this CD and there is nothing Explicit about it. Maybe someone should update the product listing ? This is an awesome CD !"
1,Not happy,This product was showcased as a purple cue stick in a purple lined case. I ordered and sent back 2 of the. 3 trying to purchase what they presented. I NEVER received one in a purple box. I finally gave up after the third try. I specifically bought this item for the purple stick and case.
1,Extremely Dissappointing,"Purchased both the Emerald Green Laser and Purple Matrix. Within 2 days the screw connection for the Emerald Green shredded and the two pieces could no longer be connected, and within a month the Purple Matrix developed a serious crack with only light use. Very poor quality in terms of workmanship and materials."
1,BUGGIEST GAME I EVER PLAYED,"I have NEVER, in 13 years of playing PC games run into one that has so many problms. It is a shame that the publisher released this game in UNFINISHED coondition. It has been in the stores since January 14th. First of all, every time you put the game in the CD drive, it wants to reinstall itself. The mouse pointer disappears during game play. The audio quality is horible. The game freezes constantly when you can get the mouse pointer to stay alive. It speeds up. It slows down. It was installed on both a WIN95 and WIN98 computer, both with Gforce 2 video cards and 128MB ram. On the Data Becker web site, they claim a patch is comming soon. Ya know what, don't bother. It's not worth the grief. Oh, and when I uninstalled it, it uninstalled DirectX. I had to reinstall DirectX and reconfigure my video drivers on BOTH computers. If this is the way they release games, these folks should be forbidden from selling, period."
2,Dissapointing Toast,"I did my research on toasters before purchasing, and this one was very highly rated. I could have gotten a lemon. It does not toast the entire slice, only the top 2/3rds. My last toaster lasted 30 years so it looks like I have 30 years of uneven toast."
2,Not what I anticipated!,"Product doesn't look like the picture at all, and it is over sized even for someone like me (fishbowl head)."
3,Decent,"This is by no means Three 6 Mafia's best release, but it does have its bright spots and the production is brilliant like always. Ever since Three 6 Mafia turned into a crunk club song type rap group, all the Twista-like fast flows are almost nonexistent. This album is pretty good but if you want to hear Three 6 Mafia at its best, listen to Mystic Stylez, Chapter 2: World Domination, or Da End."
3,maaaaaan.....,"I gotta say I was expecting a lot more from this cd. By FAR...their worst cd as TRIPLE SIX. Compared to most groups it's still a banger, but the true prophet/hypnotize followers will recognize this as the bands weakest effort as a group. I was expecting a lot more giving the amount of time we had to wait on it. If you've been down with the Prophet P from day one then you know you gotta cop it, but I just hope they start getting on point."
1,"Complete, Utter Garbage","Glorifying real word violence...robbing, looting, murdering...gee, how creative and original.Like most rap ""artists,"" these underreducated morons don't have an ounce of talent, let alone their dispicable love for violent behavior and shouting into microphones.It's so-called music like this that is a cancer in our society, and breeds more morons and idiots than we can handle.What a travesty popular music is today, worse than it's ever been, this CD isn't worthy of being one of my drink coasters."
4,Aiight,Da Unbreakbles is a good cd. But not the best. The old three six is better. The song Like a Pimp (Remix) Wit pimp c is the best song on the album.
5,Finally,Been waitin a long time for this album and its finally here and i gotta say this cd is raw as hell. Not as good as When The Smoke Clears which i think was their best cd but Unbreakables is good. Ofcourse every verse that Juicy spits is raw same for Dj Paul but Lords and Crunchy's verses seem like they keep gettin weaker but they still tight. Every song is good except 1 which is Ghetto Chick. Best song on album is either Bin Laden or The Dangerous Posse which has an incredible beat one of the best i have heard from The Supa Producers. This is a definetly must buy for 3 6 fans and even rap fans.MUTHAFUKKAAAA!
2,THE WORST ONE YET.,"This CD Has 4th Grade lyrics and what's up with the rock music that ain't gangsta they need to drop lil wigger and get back Kingpin Skinny Pimp,Playa Fly,Gandsta Blac,Mc Mack,Scanman,M-Child,Koopsta Knicca,K-Rock,T-Rock to ghost write for them again P.S go get these artist CD's thier Better!!!"
3,More of the Same,"Yes, more of the same. That's not necessarily a bad thing, because Beck's had a string of strong albums. But he's certainly plumbing on down the same line as his last disc, with industrial backdrops to yet another set of excellent solos. He certainly hasn't lost his touch for writing tasty chops. I just wonder where Beck might have gone had he hung out with musicians that challenged him more."
4,pretty funky for a white guy,"If you are looking for something along the lines of Blow by Blow then forget it. This is something new and different. Jeff's previous two albums were all about him coming to terms with techno and other types of dance-oriented music; with mixed success. He hits it with this one. The beats are great and the guitar playing is jaw-dropping as usual. He gets a nice snarling, dirty tone out of his Strat, making vigorous use of the wah-wah pedal. Most of the songs are not characterized by a melody so much as a very basic and simple riff or a sampled vocal, which Jeff then proceeds to turn into a highly bombastic and beat-laden symphony. A great CD to play in the car."
3,There and Back Again,"As a long time Jeff Beck fan, I was happy to see Jeff back out on the streets and with a new CD in fairly short order. The CD does not break any new ground and covers the same turf that Jeff has been spinning his wheels in for a few years now. Jeff said he was NOT happy with this record and is/has returned with ""Guitar Shop"" line up again for live shows. I am not so sure Jeff is ever happy with a product he has already recorded and put behind him. Jeff is (usually) onto soemthing new. The CD does tend to fall into grooves that were done elsehwere and then shipped over to Jeff to add his wondeful playing. The Apollo 440 tracks sound, well, like Apollo 440 tracks. Nothing innovative and special.Jeff needs to open up another door and not go backwards. That being said, I am always glad to wake up everyday in a world where Jeff Beck exists!"
5,The Greatest Guitarist of all time [is great]!,"This album does indeed continue in the footsteps of ""You Had It Coming"", which is very good direction for him to go. I just saw Jeff Beck live three days ago, and he just [is great](it was such a special event for me to see him live; he's my favorite guitarist). [Being great]is what he does on this album! The music overall is very well arranged. The beats are awesome. It's grooves are groovin'. And the more you listen to it, the more you enjoy it. David Torn even helped out a bit on a couple of songs.Bottom line: One can never go wrong with Jeff Beck!"
5,Neighbourhood secrets,"This is the first and only guide to Paris' 20 arrondissements - or local districts - and, though a few years since I wrote the last edition, remains the only neighbourhood guide to the city for regular visitors. Feel free to search the site for info on my more recent French travel guides, includin AA Essential Lille, AAA Travelbook France and Paris Scene."
5,"Work great, priced amazing, and sell in bulk","Bought out one vendors stock of these adapters (two orders of 30 and then their last 6 for a total of 66) adapters. With free shipping, we received these adapters in great time. We've been deploying them on two different HP desktop types, replacing dual VGA versions of this adapter.The adapters are sourced from various places but all work. We use three monitor arrangements, so we use two adapters- one with two plugs, one with one. Everything has worked fine for both arrangements. All in all, a great and cheap way to upgrade machines to DVI. Will buy more of these if we ever need more!"
5,Simply excellent,"By far the best olives I've ever tried. It's not that easy to find the olives in the stores with absolutely no vinegar or brine, just in the pure olive oil. All ingredients are just right and in right proportions. Great olives!"
5,ken boire author of Inherit the Tide,"Outskirts Press is a top notch publisher and they have put together a no nonsense account of what the business is about. Self-Publishing Simplified, provides insight from experts and does this in a direct, matter-of-fact way. The doublespeak that some publishers covet, is gone. I its place are common sense, real world, descriptions and examples. They have taken the fear and uncertainty out of publishing. Read this and you will probably be motivated to dust off that manuscript and become a published author. The staff at Outskirts Press provided valuable guidance during preparation of Inherit the Tide. Self-Publishing Simplified smoothed the way for In the Company of Fishers, a novel to be published in the near future."
5,From Publisher To Marketing Coach,"As I'm out and about at book events, bringing my orphan train to life (which I learned from Outskirts Press), many ask me about my publisher. I always tell them they deserve 5 stars. Finding the right publisher is a hard thing I'll admit. However, when we found Outskirts Press we were very pleased. The website is awesome. The customer service is second to none. Perhaps best of all is the fact that the great service doesn't stop once the book is ""hot off the press""! Coaching continues so that you are successful! It's up to you to listen or not and grasp the ideas that will work in your location, then run with them. It's up to you to be motivated enough to get out there and ""make it happen!"" However, I praise Outskirts for their many ideas and would suggest ""Self-Publishing Simplified"" to anyone who is busy but has the dream of writing a book they want to see achieved!"
5,Great Gift,This book was purchased as a birthday gift for a 4 year old boy. He squealed with delight and hugged it when told it was his to keep and he did not have to return it to the library.
5,Chicken Soup For the Funny Bone,"This is a short and sweet little book that can be read in just a few minutes, but every minute will be filled with fun! In cleverly silly rhymes Maurice Sendak takes us through the twelve months and thoroughly entertains us with his characteristic illustrations featuring the little dark-haired boy we've come to know in some of his other stories. The non-sensical inclusion of ""chicken soup with rice"" in all of the rhymes makes the months all the more memorable and easy for kids to recite, a great little device. The paperback edition is very affordable but I suspect you'll love this one so much that you'll want the hardcover in your library."
3,"Nice visuals, bad script","A well directed micro-budget film. Script wants to be ""Usual Suspects"" meets ""Resevoir Dogs"". Too bad the lead actor has too many close ups of himself that give too much away (guess thats what happens when the lead produces the film). Striking visuals & surreal tone in this film, escpecially in the artists loft. Love the snowy cemetery scene! Very quirky & interesting performance by Francesco Quinn & the other smaller roles. The producer/actor performance dies like a dog. Makes you want to shoot him yourself."
1,Oster mini max trimmer stopped working.,"Ordered Oster mini max trimmer 01-20-13. Received about 01-25-13.started using on 02-04-13. the second day of use the motor started slowing down, then stoppedoperating.So now they do not run at all. What can we do about them?"
3,Average,"Witches Knot: Triad is a decent sample of paranormal erotica. Others have reviewed the storyline pretty well, so all I'll add is that for long-time and/or prolific readers of ""menage"" erotica (paranormal or otherwise), this book doesn't offer anything new. I had the feeling throughout the book of ""been there, done that."" It's a decent book for someone trying out the genre, but not my recommendation for avid readers of such."
4,It is what it is,"Some guys have all the luck, mine smells like eggs! Anyhow, this little thing is great for your kid to use in his/her room if they are learning or messing around on the guitar and you don't want the rest of the house to hear it. I agree with others that the sound is not bad for the size and the price of the unit. If you are looking for some quality distortion effects or distortion that you can control then this is not for you. There are no adjustment knobs whatsoever. For the price you can often find Danelectro mini's at they can sure be a lot of fun."
1,Not Recommended,"I am shaking as I write this. I have never read something so biased and so upsetting in my life. I am more convinced than ever after reading this book that Karla Faye Tucker got exactly what she deserved. This book portrays her as some sort of wonderful, mislead, genuine person who made a mistake. I am stunned beyond belief at this portrayal of a murderer. It sounds to me after reading this book, that Karla Faye did not make any genuine changes, she just simply learned how to play the game, and in this case ultimately and fortunatley did not win."
2,i Hated this,This movie was one of the worst movies that i've ever had the misfortune of seeing. What makes it worse is the fact that i paid for it. The acting stunk and all around it just gives horror movies a bad name. Save your money.
3,Origional music,"It's a shame that Kenna's talent hasn't been more widley spread. He's very talented and origional, a modern musical inovation. ALthough some songs tend to repeat themselves, the lyrics are intriguing and the music is totally outstanding. Really worth the money. I hope he produces another soon."
5,not an average white band!!!,"These four guys can sing, definitely. Guess you wouldn't believe Synature is no black R&B group. They put so much heart in their music, their voices are incredible. My favourite track on the album is ""Spend the Night"", a great dance tune. Other songs like ""Nobody else"" and ""Dance with me"" feat. Beyoncé from Destinys Child keep hittin. Let's also keep an eye on their ballads, for example ""The rain"" or ""Wherever you go"", which will put you in the right mood. Too bad that Synature were dropped by their record company. I hope that we will hear more from them in future..."
3,"Too wordy, and it has been said.","Most of the logic in this book has been covered in Raising Your Spirited Child, so if you have read that, you probably don't need this. If you have not read Raising Your Spirited Child, this is a good resource. Respect your child, work with his or her personality, recognize when the child is using self-comforting techniques and try not to see them as obstacles. Or looking at it another way, suck it up, being a parent is hard.Drawbacks include that the book itself is waaaayy too wordy, and the solutions involve way too much talking. I'm never going to get to the end of most of the sentences recommended to talk things through with my child."
3,Snazzy but not great,"I was impressed by the fancy graphics and menu effects, and the novel user interface of Kai's Power Show. But I was very disappointed with the functionality in a number of areas:1. There is no built in Help, so one cannot search for the answer to a question, no FAQ list, no index. One must use trial and error to find out what the capabilities are and are not.2. The product advertises compatibility with MS PowerPoint, but I did not find out until after purchase that the newest version it is compatible with is PowerPoint 97, now over 7 years old!3. The product will not display the show full screen except on very low resolution monitors (640 x 480). Most displays and projectors are much higher resolution these days, and Power Show provides no way to up the resolution/size. It is a product that will not grow with your hardware.4. While it will play some video formats, it omits MPEG, probably the most popular of all, and also WMV."
4,Such a cute toy! Great for dress up and pretend play!,"This toy is awesome! It is so adorable! I wish you could buy extra microphone hairbrushes in lots of colors because my son (1 year old) would love one, too! We got this toy for our daughter's 3rd birthday and she adores it! It is pretty sturdy, the starshaped mirror lights up and is a safety mirror, the chair does not easily tip and the MICROPHONE hairbrush lights up when you turn it on. It is awesome! The gem shaped buttons under the mirror play upbeat/hip versions of old favs like Itsy Bitsy Spider, 5 Little Mokeys and more. There is an applause button, too! My husband did use a power screwdriver to attach the pink vanity top to the white base (with included screws) because our wimpy screwdrivers could not break through the thick plastic to do the job. But other than that assemply was easy, took less than 30 minutes. Very sweet toy and easy to clean!"
5,Learn Google--Great Reference,"I found Learn Google to be very helpful in search techniques.The use of examples makes this a terrific tool for the beginner as well as those who feel that they are beyond intoductory help books. Using the techniques described eliminates the frustration that results in many of us ""giving up"" on a search. The author makes it an enjoyable learning experience with search games."
1,No go,The viewfinder is so small that even an adult would have a hard time seeing through it - no chance for a child.
2,immature,"This novel reveals the author's fantasy. It is a glorification of criminal and immoral behavior where the protagonist personifies the successful ""player"". It is a stereotype of what inner-city youth too often aspire to, with plenty of graphic sex and violence."
2,Not A One-Handed Stroller,"As typical of Britax, the safety features/sturdiness of this stroller are not rivaled; however, this stroller is difficult to steer with one hand, akward to open & close, and recline. I have two kids, and I am unable to hold my daughter's hand and steer the stroller with the other. I thought this stroller was the answer for a compact stroller, but I am now shopping for a new one (even though my son is already 16m old)! The negatives take away from any of the positives."
4,Britax Preview,"I just got the stroller today. Easy to assemble, all you need to put on are the front wheels, the sunshade and the foot bar. No screwdrivers needed. It folds easily, but when I took my daughter out for a walk it started to close on her. I will have to see if I can fix that. Other than that she loves it and I do too."
5,ANOTHER SMOOTH RENDEZVOUS!!!,"DJ Mark Gorbulew has done it again, bringing us part 2 of the outstanding and underrated Rendezvous Lounge series that in its early stages has supassed many of those so-called chillout, hotel, Ibizan, downtempo compilation CDs by leaps and bounds. These 13 original and sexy tracks are all about mind, body and soul elevation with just the right vibe to make your bougie dinner guests wanna shake something. Rendezvous Lounge 2 sets the perfect mood for any occassion with never a dull moment at all. Lovers of jazz, r&b and electronica will without a doubt enjoy this series, done brilliantly by a man who has become one of my personal faves. Highly Recommended! (Now, Mama, can I have my CD back pleeease?????)"
4,Her Best Release in a Decade,with Mariah Carey I take a Hit&Miss stance&Mainly Miss because Her Music doesn't compliment Her Vocal Range.but the Re-Mixes here get it right for the most part.Mariah is Better Served with More Grooves in her Music&a element of Surprise than the Usual predictable Arrangements that end up as the final Cut on her records.I bet Mariah Herself is digging this Set far better than most of Her own Albums that have come out over the apst Decade.
2,Remixes That SHOULD of Been Included,"1) Someday (the version used in the video)2) Make It Happen (C+C Classic Version)3)Anytime You Need a Friend (Soul Convention Remix)4)One Sweet Day (Chucky's Remix)5) Always Be My Baby (one of the Always Club Mixes only released in the UK)6)Always Be My Baby (the version with Lil Vicious)7) Joy to the World (Morales Celebration Mix)8) Honey (Bad Boy Remix)9)My All/Stay Awhile (the version WITHOUT the rap)10) The Roof (Morales Club Mix)11) I Still Believe (Pure Imagination mix)12) I Still Believe (Stevie J Mix)13)Sweetheart: The Story (yes, there is a remix of ""Sweetheart""!)14) Underneath the Stars (the Drifting Remix)15)Heartbreaker/Love Hangover16) Can't Take That Away (Morales Triumphant Revival Mix)17) Loverboy (Club of Love Mix)"
2,"great first disc, horrible second","The first disc is full of great club remixes, and I would give that five stars. But the second disc is full of horrible guest rappers and sometimes you forget you're listening to Mariah. I don't recommend listening to the second disc. She should've put more excellent club mixes onto this cd. I recommend music box or butterfly instead."
1,mariah is getting desperate,"man she would have come off better putting out a best of mariah cd then putting out techno remixes of her best tunes this is sorry and further proof that mariah's career is washed up, c ya mariah been nice knowing you."
3,ho hum ho hum it's off to space we go,"The book is 275 pages, a little thin and so are the secondarycharacters and the plot. Most of the characters are amazinglyone dimensional. Secondary plot lines come and go withoutbeing developed. What is the deal with the model present?The basic plot is interesting and well structured but the devoidof the detail one expects from Moon. The book is complete - nocliff hanger ending although there are plenty of storyopportunities. I hope any further books in this series arelonger and richer.A Cliff Notes Elizabeth Moon book."
3,Trading in Danger,"I liked the character of Ky a great deal, but found the first half of the book slow. Ms Moon has a great writing style and a creative mind so I will try the next book in the series"
4,Vatta War 2,"Ky Vatta was a military cadet destined for great things, until an act of kindness incurred her Academy's wrath and ended her career.Instead of the expected disgrace, her rich trader family gave her captaincy of a small ship, to sell for scrap. In flagrant disregard of orders, she saw the opportunity to make a profit and save the ship. Several upgrades later, Ky is determined to retain the ship and her independence in the cut-throat world of interplanetary trading. But a threat emerges that challenges even her sharp wits and, if she survives, could leave the military forever in her debt ... {orbit books}"
4,this is great.,"This is a great album...wonderful voice..smooth music..duet wit D'Atra Hicks....Love ,Honor and Obey you."
3,not a CD version of the original album! damn! it's a live version of a collection of songs & doesn't have the title track on it!,"I hope Bon Scot comes over to haunt whoever presented this CD because it's not what it's portrayed to be. It's not the original album even though it's the original album cover. It's a collection of songs and the entire album is from a LIVE recording. I've seen ACDC live many many times, met Bon Scot and loved their live shows, but what I received is different from what I believed I would. What I was expecting was a CD format of the original STUDIO RECORDED album. This is not that.Worst of all, it doesn't even have ""If You Want Blood"" on the damn CD!pisses me off"
5,Add this to your collection; you won't be disappointed!,"I was excited to find this Christmas compilation that gives you a wonderful blend of the old time holiday favorites blended with the big brassy sound of Chicago. Sons of Champlin fans will be pleased to hear the influence Bill Champlin has on these recordings. Being a huge Chicago and Sons of Champlin fan, it's almost too much fun to have my favorites on a Christmas CD! Buy it; you'll play it over and over again."
3,"It was inevitable, but are College marching songs next?","I confess. This album is so pleasant that I listened to it up through July. As X-mas is coming up in a few months, I will probably start listening to it again in October."
2,did not work on arrival,this printer would not print correctly immediately after install. I checked all troubleshooting ideas and FAQ's. No luck the print was unreadable.
2,TN-550 Toner Cartridge a Rip Off,"My beef with the product is the toner cartridge. The manual states a TN-550, good for 3500 pages, comes with the unit. From the first moment the unit was turned on, a ""Toner Low"" message came on the screen. Fifty pages later, the cartridge was dry and the machine inoperable, necessitating the purchase of a new toner cartridge. In effect, the refurbished unit cost an extra $70. This is not a bargain. The machine is fine. Single page printing is fast, a lot faster than my HP 4000. The rate of two sided printing is about the same as the HP. Print quality is excellent. The ability to direct functions from my computer using the software's Control Center, is a plus. All function perform flawlessly. I have only Microsoft XP."
3,"Nothing Compared to ""Picaresque""","All bands have to find themselves. This album is searching. And ""Picaresque"" is finding."
1,Not what I see in the Picture,I see a Silver cutter in the picture. I received a basic black cutter. I will probably give it to a friend that needs a cheap cigar cutter.
3,pretty good,"Steven Waldman does an excellent job of explaining the substantive issues surrounding the national service bill and its corollary, student aid reform, and showing how conflicting ideals were reconciled or submerged. The detail gets a bit tedious in the last chapter, but the book does live up to its subtitle. Johnson & Broder's ""The System,"" about the 1994 health care reform campaign, is a longer but more exciting book along the same lines."
3,Not sticky enough,"This mat is okay. I use it on carpet, so as far as sliding around - I haven't experienced any problems there. However, the top of the mat doesn't seem to be sticky enough for me. If I'm sweaty at all (duh, I'm working out), then my feet/hands will often slip."
1,New Age Twaddle,"...with apologies to ""New Age"" and ""twaddle"". I couldn't decide whether this book was meant to be funny (which it isn't) or profound (which it isn't). Clumsy attempts to weave pseudoreligious and misunderstood metaphysical concepts into a present-day parable about a psychotherapist (leave out the therapist part) who is convinced he is the new Messiah because his inner voice gives him stock market tips, propel a story filled with nonsense that will only seem illuminating to those sad, grossly unenlightened seekers who get their religious ideas from Jerry Springer and self-help tapes. Only train-wreck fascination kept me going in an effort to glean some true point from this fractured fable until the accumulating insult and violence done to plot, character, metaphysics, religion, and punctuation ultimately compelled me to hurl this book out the window. One star for being a good projectile."
5,Coarse Comb Review,This comb works well. I use it on long haired dogs with undercoats and it does well.
3,Too much of a good thing...,"I'm not saying that the CD is bad, but all the songs start to run together after a while. The album starts very powerful and you know you're in for something different. I'd say they are like a christian Salt n' Peppa mixed with a little TLC. The problem is that the songs were not chosen well, so it makes all the songs sound the same. But I did enjoy."
3,Good art book.,"I will admit, I hate most Christopher Hart books. But this one is quite unique. It's not trying to impersonate a style like anime or manga. It's reviving a very unique style of art referred to as ""retro"".I love this book because this is definitely my style. But the style in this book (and some of the advice) is quite limiting. Cartoons like Kim Possible, Danny Phantom, and to a lesser extent Teen Titans the animated show really show off the retro style evolved to a great extent.I would definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a unique style beyond anime, manga (which I happened to draw all the time before this book), and Marvel Comics.But it definitely would be good to have a basic understanding of anatomy, since this book does not go into it really at all."
3,Flick of the switch review,"This album wasn't that easy to find in retail stores, or shall I say what is left of them in 2010-2011.Yeah so I turned to the good ol reliable Amazon to snag one.I really like it, of course it's not packing any hits but it doesn't suck either - the only thing I was looking for was a bit more solos from Angus but I didn't get it.Oh well it still rocks."
4,Under-Rated AC/DC album,"I love Flick of the Switch. If I had to choose between Back in Black, Razors Edge, and this..as being the best Johnson Era Album, I would choose this Razors Edge..YET..this is a very under-rated album...To my knowledge this album didnt produce one hit, yet the songs on this album are very heavy (title track smokes!!) and so does Badlands....Even though very unfamiler to people but to true AC/DC fanatics..this should be in your CD library as it never grows old and rocks hard..ENJOY"
1,Useless!,"This mattress topper is useless! Yeah it is soft, but it's like a marshmallow. It is soft, but if you put any weight/pressure on it, it just flattens out and becomes useless. It is just a big piece of foam with square edges. Mine did not come with a cover, like one reviewer said theirs did. (didn't say came with cover, just saying because a reviewer said it did) It was shipped in the packing box only and plastic. It was not packed with a retail box, no labels of any brand or anything. It also was packed so tightly that you have to rip apart the shipping box just to get it out. I will be going back to Walmart to get the same topper I got 4 years ago, that at least lasted 4 years! Please don't waste your money on this!"
3,Won't make a bad mattress good!,"Bought for my son who has an old uncomfortable mattress. Helped with the softness somewhat but where the indentations are the pad follows. Son says it tilts him toward the center. Guess you need to have a fairly good, level mattress to start with, it's not going to make a bad mattress into a good one."
1,Wholesome Fun?,"Let's see if I have this right . . . Two strangers find themselves snowed-in together at a deserted cabin. In the time it takes to roast his chestnuts and melt her marshmallows, they're falling for each other. Meanwhile, his poor wife languishes with alzheimers in a nursing home. Wholesome fun for the whole family? Call me a prude, but I think I'll pass."
4,great movie bad delivery service!!,my sistere-in-law loves the movie!!i paid extra money to have it delivered for Christmas and it did not get here until several days later.
5,One of my favorite holiday movies,"This is by far one of my favorite holiday movies! I just caught it again (for the third time) on Lifetime, on Thanksgiving night and it was a wonderful way to wind down Thanksgiving and begin the Christmas season, as the movie takes place on Thanksgiving and ends on Christmas morning. Julie Andrews has long been a favorite of mine and I was excited to see her reunited with James Garner. It is obvious that they have worked together previously and their chemistry is perfect as two ""strangers in the night."" It is charming without being overly sentimental and is just a pleasure to watch because it is so well written (you really get to know these characters within a 2-hour span)and it leaves you wanting to know more about them, more about their past and their future together. Do yourself a favor, make a cup of tea and sit down and enjoy this most enchanting holiday movie."
3,Hey it's Garner and Andrews,"A little dated and completely predictable, but still a wonderful story told by two actors who still have chemistry with each other."
4,Special!!,This could so possibly be true. Best acting and story line excellent. Both Garner and Andrews have done superb acting in this ovie.
4,One special night,"If you enjoy classic movies, this is it. It has romance, love and adventure. It has classic stars such as James Garner and Julie Andrews.I love old movies and this fits right in."
5,Appreciated,I bought it as a gift for my sister in law; she was very happy to receive the movie after reading the James Garner biography.
2,Yes just give up. Why don't we all give up?,"If I had followed the advice in this book I would have given up on my husband I wouldn't be happily married with four children. Nicely written but I find it to be a narrow-minded, somewhat chauvenistic view. Many of my closest friends got their man by NOT GIVING UP! Sometimes a good man doesn't know what he's missing until the woman in his life walks away but it doesn't mean she has to walk away without knowing exactly what it is that she is doing! I guarantee you turn around and walk away and the man, whoever he is, will most likely follow."
2,Not what I expected,"This book was referred to me by my therapist, although she never read the book. After reading chapter 1, you've read it all. I find Mr. Behrendt a bit insulting, sometimes you even wonder if he doesn't think he's Dr. Phil. Keep in mind that the book was not written by professionals (psychologists) and you cannot generalize, every man, every couple and every situation is different and the way they give it to you is way too simple. Relationships are more complex than that. For me, this book is more for entertainment than reading into the signs. Women are not that stupid, we know when a guy is into us or not..."
5,Total Eye Opener,"I just spent the last 6 months obsessing over a ""great"" guy who appeared to have every inclination of taking the next step and truly making me a part of his future. After reading ""He's just not that into you,"" All of the obvious signs were like a slap in the face! Greg and Liz spell out exactly why a man who is really smitten treats his intended like a precious part of his life, and why a man who is not sure about a girl does not. From the obvious (""He's just not that into you if he's not calling you"") to the uncomfortable (He's just not that into you if he's sleeping with someone else""), this book should get any sane girl out of any muddy grey relationship and empower her to move on with her life. A must have for every woman over 16!"
3,intresting,"only desperate women buy this crap. be a tramp and buy it to make the author rich so she can help support her illegitimate child. since there is nothing wrong with being unmarried and living with your boyfriend according to this book, be immoral and get pregnant!!!!"
3,Good but could be taken further,"This is a good book and was very entertaining to read. It could have gone further and given more examples of what to do in different situations. It's a good book to give to ""wake up"" someone that isn't getting a relationship.A good conversation book.Michael CooganCo-Author Know Your Pig - Playful Relationship Advice for Understanding your Man(Pig)www.knowyourpig.com"
5,This is the second time I bought this book,"The first time, I had a highlighter and took notes, and then lent it to everyone I knew. Which of course, means I lost it and had to buy it again. I finally have a nice man, but I'm glad I read this book, because I was falling for some of these behaviors! I'm a successful woman in a man's profession. I have a master's degree and am completely self-sufficient, but for some reason, it took this book to get me to realize I DESERVE someone great. The real lesson was what behaviors are unacceptable vs. ""pick-your-battle."""
3,Good Info,I like the info he gives. I bought it for daughter and friends to read since sometimes they choose boys without regard to the way they treat them.
4,Worth Reading,"While I don't always agree with the ""theory"" behind this book, the practice of it--walk away from guys who are wishy-washy, that don't pick up the phone, that won't commit, etc. Stop trying read minds or find secret clues or guess behavior--if they don't act like proper relationship material, they aren't. I love that message and think every woman would be happier if they made it their new motto."
1,I'M JUST NOT BUYING THIS BOOK,"This book gives misleading information about men who are already in relationships. It claims that a man will string-along his girlfriend while he waits for someone 'better' to come along. The reality is, that most men just take longer to make relationship commitments than women do. Research in psychology and neuroscience confirms this. Most mature men do actually want commitments. Many a woman who reads this book now believes that her boyfriend is 'just not that into her', when really, her guy is just on a different timeline.*I recommend books like ""What Could He Be Thinking? How a Man's Mind Really Works"" by Michael Gurian, and also the work of John Gray. Books such as these provide well-researched* insights into understanding men and relationships.Lastly, I think it's a shame that a Hollywood t.v. writer can parade around as if he were an expert in human behavior, and receive so much positive attention for it!"
2,Entertaining? Yes... Educational? No...,"Anyone that has had a serious relationship should find this humorous, but simplistic.It's all common sense, and not any sort of stellar epiphany within these series of case studies represented by supposed letters from 'women' such as 'Nikki' who seems like the most lobotomized female I have ever read about.If you have had a relationship of any kind, have self-esteem, or are over the age of 17, you should already realize that ACTIONS are what matter, and that men are not that complicated.I recommend that you buy ""Date Like a Man"" or ""Why Men Love Bitches"" as those are hilarious as well, and while also not really telling anything new, contains useful behavior modification techniques for the lay person. ;-)"
5,Hilarious,Every single woman should read this book! I had no idea men actually think this way...totally hilarious!
1,Book for Stupid Women,"I have no pity for women who behave like Desperate Housewives and then get dumped on their butts. This guide, however, may prove enlightening for those women who are clueless when it comes to men. FYI: not for intelligent women."
2,The author's guide to a girl who wants to woo him,"Greg Behrendt has written a great guide for a girl who'd like to woo and marry him. The guide is probably also useful for men similar to him. However, not all men are cast in one mold! If all women followed his advice, there would be a lot of unhappy singles walking around.Greg advises women to drop men who treat them poorly. OK, this is good advice.However, among Greg's strictures: never ask a guy out, never call a guy first, etc., etc. Basically, he is very opposed to a female making the first move. This is ridiculous for two reasons. First, many shy men would find themselves in a bad spot, as well as women who are partial to shy men. Secondly, in this modern day and age, his book simply perpetuates gender roles which are no longer meaningful to a large portion of society.Greg defines relationships with rules and games rather than understanding and communication."
2,Not really,"This book would leave one with the impression that if a man didn't hound you for 6 weeks to date you, then propose within the year, that he's not worth the trouble because he's never gonna commit.It's not without its sound advice, but I think most people are better off trusting their own instincts than a flippant book written by some dude who thinks he knows it all, and some chick who doesn't seem to have much common sense if it isn't first spelled out to her."
4,"Short, funny and oh so true","There is absolutly nothing revolutionary or complex here to learn about men; and if I'm not mistaken that's exactly the point. When it comes to men and whether or not they are ""into"" a woman, we gals do make it far more complicated than it needs to be. Men are sexually motivated, men who do not want to have sex with you are NOT into you. Really, everything else Greg says should be required reading by all women/girls prior to entering the dating world. It would save us all alot of heartache and humiliation. Honestly ladies, men like to pursue, if they're not, then you know your answer. Okay there are shy men who may require a ""nudge"", but honestly any guy who's received the ""signals"" from a woman he's interested in will be like a dog with a bone (eg. all over it and not willing to let it go!)"
4,A spoonful of sugar makes the medicine go down......,"this book is very funny--and very true, so it is like taking a dose of reality with a spoonful of sugar. Women tend to 'love too much', refuse to believe the worst and give the benefit of the doubt, to a potential suitor--or pseudo suitor. He's Just Not that Into You, is like a talk with your worldly wise grandmother, it helps to take an honest look at motive. If a man or a woman likes you, they may come around or allow you to chase them and build up their ego...but if they LOVE you, they do the work TOO--pick up the phone..etc. It is a good, simple book--simple is good too."
5,Insightful!,"Wonderful book! Easy book with lots of insight. If you really want to understand a bit more of relationships, then I would recommend to leave behind any bias opinions about men or relationships, and go full throttle digesting every word in the book. Greg and Liz write to those who need tough love, but with a very kind and loving heart. Some information is straighforward, without any hesitation. But, wouldn't you rather know now than later?! I WOULD! I definitely began the book with an open mind and was blown away by some of the ""wake up calls"" I didn't know before. This book has definitely altered my path in such a positive and profound way! I am very grateful for every single word written within the covers.(The book was delivered five days earlier than promised! How great is that! So, I was already starting off on the right path by selecting this book...)"
3,Generalised but realistic,"I remember the episode in the TV series when this scene played out and I was like Miranda where I felt it was like a breathe of fresh air. Yes I think men and women are much more complicated than the book implies, and yes, I know its a generalisation but so many times I have seen myself and my mates agonise about 'will he or wont he' and always give the guy the benefit of the doubt, by presuming that he is sick /busy/ unable to call but the truth is that if he is thinking about you and mad about you is probably going to find a way to call!! It is also good to apply this message to friendships - when we find ourselves doing all the work then that friend needs to step up, or they arent that into us either. Its a fun somewhat challenging book that gets us to be a little more honest with ourselves"
2,Slick schtick,"This book is entertaining, but shouldn't be taken seriously. When a guy is ready, he's ready. When the relationship clicks, that will be it. Both sexes have to stop looking for excuses or rationalizations and get real. When it's right, and you're both smart and mature, you will both know it."
3,Tight but right,"Like most of the reviewers have already said, it is mostly common sense (especially after ch 6) and it is a short read. But it's also a wake up call. When you fall in love with the wrong one, some times love blinds you and you don't realize he is no longer into you (This is for the ones who lost interest). I found the letters to greg to be both stupid and funny- funny because we can laugh at how dumb they are being. Yet deep down we know it's an exaggeration or either ourselves or someone we know."
2,Isn't all this stuff a NO DUH?!?!,"Come on girls... think with your heads! The problem we women have is that we think too much with our hearts, and we stop seeing what's right in front of us. Maybe if we woke up collectively, books like this wouldn't have to be written. Having said all that, the book was well-written, but for what I paid for it, I expected it to last more than 4 hours (which is what it took me to finish it). If you've been through the married man, the man that will never get married again, the relationship with no passion, and any variations of the aforementioned, I think you will find this book not quite as interesting as many of the readers do."
1,Just not that into this book,"I bought this book expecting to be drawn in with witty writing and relevent stories. I just could not get into it past the first 2 pages, and the book has been collecting dust ever since. Pretty cover design though, and good title. Still, money wasted as far as I'm concerned."
2,Not Every Guy is the Same,"Sorry, I bought this book thinking I would see and learn more about how we men think and relate to women, to improve in this area. This book shows nothing more than one type of guy, your basic dysfunctional jerk, and does nothing to help people get real in relationships. I gave it two stars because it helps women see what a careless jerk would be like, but not every guy is the same. I was disappointed in the read."
1,The title pretty much sums it up...,"Not much need to read the book if you've read the title. The author states it outright: men are not that complicated...but then we knew that all along. Food, sleep, sex and sports -- what else do they need?Behrendt tries to soften the blow with continual assurances that we are hot, pretty and deserve someone better. He's right about that, too, and if we stop giving it up for men who don't deserve us, it's more likely that we will find someone who does. So when men are no longer getting sex, they will have Behrendt to thank for it."
1,Obvious,"The ""review"" by Karen Hudson probably is better advise than anything he wrote in the book. He states the blatantly obvious and he has clearly hung out with a less than stellar croud of men. If it isn't terribly obvious that's because that particular advise is wrong 50% of the time. The best thing he said was don't chase, which if you are chasing a guy, he's running for a reason so forget him."
2,Inaccurate,"While this book was an entertaining read, it was above all inaccurate. When I finished reading this book, the impression I got was, unless he buys you a diamond ring on your 3 month anniversary, or lets 12 hours go by before calling after a date, he's just not that into you. Oh, ok. So if he leaves towels on my bathroom floor, it MUST be because he's not that into me, versus the obvious fact that he's lazy when it comes to hanging up towels.If I were a man and a woman I was interested in avoided doing any work in the relationship whatsoever to test how interested I was, believe me, it wouldn't last long."
1,A waste of time...,"There are lots of great books on relationships out there... this is definately NOT one of them. Written totally from a man's point of view (center of the universe it would seem) and an admitted ""dog"" as a single man, this book was somewhat amusing at times. However, if you are looking for real advice on relationships or dating, look elsewhere! Dateworthy by Dennie Hughes is a much better book."
4,Ran out of excuses.,"I can't believe all the things I told myself: He has a horrible father? Had a hands off mother? Wasn't loved enough as a child. Canadians have different dating rituals (one of my favorites). Just needs a woman like myself to understand his complexities and to love him unconditionally. What a load of crap. Greg and Liz are right. Either a man digs you or he doesn't. Yes, this book is common sense but sometimes common sense goes out the window when the fantasy looks a whole lot better than reality. So with the help of this book I grew a backbone and (...)"
1,Book for Teeny Boppers,"Would you believe girls need books to tell them this? I had a friend reading this and I checked it out for laughs. She told me it was weak, but she got as a gift.If your naive, live in a closet or are insecure - this is for you.If you are independent, confident, intelligent - take a pass. This is clealy a female gender book so as a guy I might be a bad judge, but it makes me think there are a lot of silly girls out there if crap is selling."
2,Pathetic!,"This book is pathetic for making women feel even more pathetic! Let's turn the tables for a moment:If a man were attempting to date a single mom with 2 teen-agers in her house, she owns, manages and markets her own business with five employees, and last but not least she is studying to be licensed as a medical professional.Now this dear lady has not responded to the gentleman's calls and/or emails in his expected time frame. Would the author dare tell this man that ""She's just not that into you!"" I think not!There are no ""pat"" answers. As mature, intelligent people you have to trust your feelings and above all COMMUNICATE with each other!"
3,Made me laugh and think,"For the most part I enjoyed the book. I think that it gave me some helpful hints and opened my eyes to somethings in the past and some issues in the present. I don't think that it is the Bible of dating but I do think that you can get a good laugh at the book and yourself for being so silly over a guy at times. We all have lets admit it, even me!I feel that at times it is okay to call a guy or maybe chat one up in bar. What I feel the book was trying to get across was that you don't and shouldn't make all the moves. Let him make some becuase if he is into you, you will not have to do all the work."
1,Don't Plan On Using This For Games,"When I first put this card in I was impressed with the sound quality. If your buying this for music or just to plug it into your stereo, it does a good job. If you wish to install and play games go elsewhere. It likes to lock up on most games."
2,Pretty but cheaply made & came with missing/broken parts,"The crib is lovely but I was disappointed in the ""craftsmanship"". The wood was split, the bumber was missing one of the ties (so it is floppy and lays down on one side), the mobile song is deffective and the mobile stars and hearts keep falling off. It also came with a piece marked for another product, so my Husband had to cut down our own piece of wood to fit.It looks beautiful in my daughters room but I dont feel it was worth the $70 we paid for it"
1,Waste of Money,"I bought this crib from Amazon LLC as a ""Santa"" present for my 4 year old daughter. We started putting it together on December 22 and discovered that it is horribly defective. Every piece of wood was cracked and/or split. It continued to split as we put it together. The bedding had a horrible odor to it and the mobile does not work. It is now 3 days before Christmas and I can not find a replacement. I bought most of my gifts from Amazon this year and I am hoping the rest are better than this. I would not recommend this product."
2,cheaply made partical board,got it around August and a few months it was already falling apart. My girls use it alot but have been careful science they had one similar before. I hate paying alot of money for something and it fall apart so soon. I have already used super glue and clamps on this. don't waste your money.
2,Bendable plastic,"These sticks are plastic and need to be straightened after a bit of use. There is a company that makes sticks made of maple, but the angle is all wrong. These two companies need to get together and work out a proper Nok Hockey stick"
5,Nice replacement set,Product arrived promptly in the mail. Quality is good and the price was fair. Would order here again if need be.
1,WON'T LAST!!!!,"Purchased this Nok Hockey and when it came it was in pieces, totally a shoddy job of construction, because the box was destroyed when un packing I was left to repair the game board the best I could with real screws and not the staples they used to assemble the board. Not only did the staples pull out but the wood was split and had to be glued and screwed back together. A total disappointment after expecting a game that I played as a kid when the board was constructed to take a beating in the playground where it lasted for years of daily use."
4,Excellent reading for engineers,"This is a great book that tells the story of a bygone era when the name Rolls Royce stood for everything excellent in engineering. Being able to produce a new jet engine during wartime in only 9 months is incredible. (no computers,cad etc then!!) A very good read."
5,you your whole crew your quick to back down!!!!,this album is real serious.the beats are hot and they go perfect wit the bravehearts flow.jungle spit good but wiz just be spittin that fire on this albumoverall its a hot debut album go cop it
2,Average,"""Quick to Back Down"" and ""Twilight"" are the two tracks which save this cd from being thrown out of my disc changer. Because these two tracks are f@ing tight makes it not a total waste. Track 2 is decent but really short and 5 is semi-solid as well, however the rest lack any solid beats or guest appearances which would help this new group solidify.Overall, the tracks featuring Nas or Lil Jon & The Eastside Boyz are solid, the rest are NOT and it takes more than 2-4 solid tracks on a 14 track cd to be good. There is potential though and I'll be back to check out Bravehearts next one."
1,Not Worth Your Money,"Quick to Back Down is the only best track on the cd and that's only because Lil Jon and Nas are on it. Other then that, this cd is not worth listening to."
5,Cute Book,"A nice biography on Aaron Carter that tells you his life story. Easy to read, had pictures, and was truthful. It was pretty good. I would recommend it to a new Aaron Carter fan or someone who dosn't know much about him. If you're a big Aaron Carter fan, read the book his mom wrote"
5,BJ-RK IS THE BEST!!!,"YAYYYY, I LOVED THIS BOX SET, IT HAS PLUTO LIVE ON HOMOGENIC LIVE, IT'S THE BEST!"
2,Great book - awful eBook!,"This is pretty straightforward - I really enjoyed ""Yes Man."" I was entertained, I was moved, I was inspired. At least when I wasn't trying to decipher the god-awful OCRed text in the Kindle edition. Chunks of it are practically unreadable. Unless you have high tolerance for that, buy a hardcopy."
5,Let's Not Ignore The Art Work,"I will not rehash what other reviewers have already said. This is a remarkable piece of music. But to this day I still think it has some of the best cover art to ever appear. The white mouse, holding onto the glowing filaments, inside a clear light bulb is just way cool. This was not an easy feat back in the seventies, before Photo Shop and digital imagery. It is a shame that it must now be reduced to the size of a jewel case. I actually have a record store poster of the cover. I think it is a contemporary work of art."
2,The worst in the catalogue? Probably yes.,"By this point in time (1985), Brian Johnson had already lost his voice (the guy chose to sing Back In Black well above its natural range, so he had to do the same in tours. Add to that his lack of care for his throat capacities - drinking and smoking - and in five years his voice was totally shot).This album was a shame, because Flick Of The Switch, although not that great, was maybe the heaviest and angriest AC/DC album ever.FLY ON THE WALL has Johnson hopelessly screaming through the songs, lacking everything. The song themselves are a caricature, the lyrics reach new levels of low even for AC/DC (Johnson phase) standards.Well, at least they did not go hair metal...Forget about it."
2,Grade D+,"Having at one time, been a great AC/DC fan, I was sadden at this release. Looking back I can see why. No new ground was made. Still the same old AC/DC, sex, drugs, and rock-n-roll, with the same old sound. Shake Your Foundations, and Sink The Pink, are the two best known songs off this cd, but that is not saying alot. Boring with a capital B. The playing is lifeless. Only Playing With Girls, seems to have any fire behind it. At least this time, they didn't produce the cd, like they did with the awful FLICK THE SWITCH."
4,Wonderful fidgeting toy,"I'm ADD inattentive, but very hyper with my fingers. I usually skin pick when I don't have anything to do with my hands and it's very frustrating because I can't stop it myself. I use this therapy putty as my ""thinking thingy"" and it really works wonders when my fingers crave stimulation!My only complaint is that the putty turns very soft and sticky when I've used it for many hours. I usually just take a new piece then and wait for the other to cool and harden again.~*~I bought three of these; one soft consistency, one medium and one hard. The soft putty has a consistancy close to jelly to me. The medium one is a bit like clay. The hard one reminds me of ""poster tack""."
2,Way TOO HARD,"I was diagnosed with RSD 4 months ago, and I go to therapy daily and use the putties. When I had to travel, I decided to buy this in order to continue some of the exercises....Oh boy, I could not, this putty is WAY TOO HARD, compared to the one of the same color in therapy....there was no way I could use it...or manipulate it, or do anything with it....RSD is a serious condition, very painful, and hard to deal with.....the manufacturers should make a softer one, for people like me that can hardly close their fingers......something they can sort of ""play around with"", very soft, until things get better and one can advance to these ones."
5,Absolutely wonderful and insightful DVD.,"I never heard anyone teach on how we are so wonderfully and fearfully made in God's imagine before...Not like this anyway. This is Awesome and in-lightning. You will be in awe of the Lord even more, after hearing just how we are created and formed in his image!!! Get it, you will not be sorry!!!!"
1,Very Poor Quality,"The ring was not the one pictured and described. Instead, the designs were very poorly stamped and the ring was not neatly sautered, plus it didn't have the antiqued effect. I had to pay money to get and then return this misleading product."
2,IMPORTANT REVIEW,"If you are short on time and happen to be short on patience as well, write the author of the book and demand an abridged version. It seems he had a mandatory work count he had to hit, because he overstated things. Alot. And then he did it again. Alot. Get my point. He used the phrases ""emerging generations"" and ""holistic worship"" a couple hundred times. (That's a tad annoying) Not only that, the book really seemed to stray from what i thought it was going to be, a book about creating worsip gatherings. If you want to read a book about how worship gaterhings were intended to be try the New Testament."
5,Emerging Worship,"We used this book as the text for a workshoop on Emerging Worship and we all found it an excellent, easy to read and understand book. Being ""beyond"" the age of most Emerging Worship groups we still found the book to be inspiring and stimulating. We ""conducted"" a short (30 minute) service for the others attending other classes and they found our service to be extremely inspirational amd planned to take some of the ideas home to their own churches to try."
4,Review of the Book Be Your Best,"This is a fairly old book (1989) about being personally effective in our own life and in our relationships. There are many so personal development books written about communicationI think this is one of the better books I've read. Why because its simply and clearly written, it amply covers the topics in the book and it's still relevant.It's one of those book no matter how many times you read it, you will still get something out of it. Most of us need to improve our communication skills. Relationship constantly challenge us and this book is a very useful tool to refer back to remind us where we went wrong and help us back on track.It cost me $15.00 second hand and its money very well spent. The book rightfully reminds us that we are resonsible for for our own feelings, and it has one of the best explanations of active listening I've read"
2,A poor scan of a decent book.,"There are many mistakes left in after an optical character recognition (OCR) scan of this book. Many maps seem to be missing. The maps that are included are small. Many times & for no apparent reason a picture of a physical page of the book is inserted.Worst, IMO, footnotes appear in the middle of the text, often with NO indication that they are not part of the narrative. The reader is left to determine from context how much of the paragraph(s) that follow are actually footnotes.The book is available free in PDF format online. Don't spend a dime for this one. (The PDF version has none of these problems.)"
3,Shipping Issues,I like these CDs ordered but the last few shipments have arrived with cracked cases. Fortunately the CDs weren't scratched. The packaging needs to be better for items this heavy.
1,Terrible packaging,"The product is fine but the packaging was terrible and the case arrived all broken, with very little packaging material, and a couple of the discs compromised too. Unusual for amazon and I was very disappointed."
3,Hollow back :( Looks cheap.,"I was hoping for a nicer charm. The back is concave, and I think that it looks very cheap. Probably not worth what I paid."
4,A Hungry Heart: A Memoir,"Gordon Parks brings the memoir to the reader almost as vividly as his photographs. I like to find the origin of the person, and Parks certainly affords just that. I can't wait to read his other memoirs. mike"
5,A Beast,This is a very impressive subwoofer. I powered it using the Kenwood KAC-9152D at 900W RMS. This thing would bump. I had it for one year and it is still going strong. Im looking to expand and would look nowhere else than Kicker. Be careful to contact the seller if you intend to purchase the 04 model though. The 06 and 04 differ in cone color.
3,Provides some relief,This is not the cure-all but it does ease pain and soreness in the neck. The effect feels similar to having your neck gently stretched out vertically (like mild traction). I'm using it in combination with a posture protector (which pulls your shoulders back and aligns your neck) and both interventions have reduced my neck pain and stiffness significantly.
4,very relaxing,"I carry a lot of tension in my neck and upper back, and as a result get a lot of headaches. I have been using the Real-Ease for about two months, and have found it very effective at releasing the tension in my neck and upper back and alleviating my headaches. I have not used it as a preventative - only when I already have a headache. If something happened to the one I have, I would definitely buy another."
3,"Good, but not Great","I bought this item because I have two herniated discs in my neck, and I was looking for something that would support my neck. While this item is comfortable, it didn't provide enough support for my neck, as it tended to hold my head in a position the tilted my chin more towards my chest than towards the ceiling, which is what my physical therapist recommended. May work for others, just not what I needed."
2,Does nothing,"This piece of plastic does nothing for me. Doesn't relax my neck, stop headaches or help TMJ. In fact, a little piece of plastic on the bottom sticks into my spine in a painful way. Definitely not worth it for me."
2,i think it hurt my neck,"Not long after i started using it my neck got sore. I'm not sure of the cause and while I don't want to blame the neck ease thing I stopped using it. My sister loves it though, and maybe I should give it another try. I've read the complaints about the workmanship, I don't have an issue with that, it's good quality. I'm just not sure it's for me. The lumbar extender is, though, and I use it every day. My posture is way better and my back doesn't ever get sore now."
2,Flimsy material not worth money,"The plastic was flimsy and you can easily get off balance if you tilt your body at all while lying down. I was hoping it would target the back of my neck, almost like a massage tool but did nothing other than lift my head. putting rolled up towels under your head may be just as effective."
3,Not what I expected,"I was anxious to try this as I carry considerable stress in my neck and shoulders. Although this device was comfortable and easy to use, it did not help my shoulders and relief was short lived. I would save my money and not recommend it to a friend. The good review is for the vendor. They were very prompt in filling my order and it arrived in good condition."
2,Didn't do much,"It felt nice when my head and neck were resting on the real-ease, but the device failed to relieve the tension in my upper back and neck (past the time I spent lying on the device). I'm about 6' tall."
4,Great tasting and natural too,"My kids had nothing but Annie's until they started school and had Kraft mac and cheese on a play date. They still prefer Annie's, which surprised and pleased me. They make both ""totally natural"" and organic mac and cheese, so your kids can have this perennial favorite without all the artificial colors and flavors. It could be a bit cheesier, but I just add a sprinkle of shredded cheddar on top."
4,Dunno,"When I was younger, I got some sea monkeys from ToysRus. They all died out though. Now I want some more. Does anyone know how long it takes them to ship a sea monkey set from toysRus to places around Quincy? Once you get sea monkeys, how can you keep them alive the longest, and make more eggs so i can have more sea monkeys?"
2,Monkey Ripp-off,"When I bought them, I put a little to much food and a couple minutes later they died. Then we got a refill and they never hatched. I strongly recomend that parents DO NOT buy this toy for their child."
3,Still Not as Good as Older Crockpots,"After reading previous reviews this seemed the best choice. The Salton I bought was horrible and I threw it out. However, I have made two meals so far with Farberware and both were not done after 10 hours on low. The last one was simply potatoes, carrots (on bottom) and 2 1/2 lb chuck roast. My old Rival I got in '87, on the other hand, gets the job done in that time. Unfortunately, it's non-stick bottom is a gonner. So I guees I'll carry on with this one and put it in longer or have the kids turn to high when they get home."
3,Obviously a burned copy,"I was so excited when I received my pkg with one of my favorite Christmas cds. Looking at it you could tell without a doubt that it was a burned copy. The songs are not in the order of the homemade label. If ur going 2 sell a burned copy, at least make it look good and let the order of the songs match the label. Ugh"
1,horrible,The c.d. was not what I expected. The song list on the case does not match the songs on the c.d. Truly Disappointed. The c.d. did not sound good.
1,not worth it!,"I purchased this product and quickly learned the reason as to why it's been discontinued. It is HORRIBLY slow. It freezes up when trying to simply search for wireless networks, or when switching between screens. Then I installed some medical programs on it and it was even slower. Finally I uploaded one photograph to it......ONE!! And the thing got stuck in a reset loop. It just kept resetting itself, and no matter what buttons i pushed or for how long it just kept turning on and off and on and off. When I taped it back up in the box to return, it was still resetting itself. I think the battery died not long after I shipped it back."
1,expensive junk,"this device is hugely overpriced with the lack of usable features it offers. The web browsing capabilities are lame, bluethooth functions crash the machine sometimes - and it doesnt play well with third party sofware. Palm killed handhelds basically a long time ago & keeps driving the spike into the coffin with this one.Handsprings were so much more solid & worked alot better. Huge corporations like Palm ruined the industry unfortunately with their non-existent technical support and lack of updates & cross functionality with phones & computers.Just wait until something better comes out."
4,slow processor - good memory,"The Palm life drive has a slow processor, though capacious memory for adding applications, and adding memos, addresses and voice messages.The sceen is sharp and noticeably superior to the Tungsten I previously used.Definately larger than most Palms, the storage case provided is useless. I purchased an after market belt case by Case Logic which works perfectly."
2,Pretty disappointing,"This is my third Palm product, after first using the Palm III and the Palm M515 over the past six years. Very disappoinging. It crashes frequently and needs hard resets once or twice a week. This never happened on my ealier Palms nor on my wife's Palm. Some of the features are good, such as a very readable screen. However, the hassle factor of having to reset the hard drive, which takes sevearl minutes to reboot, make it sluggish and unappealing. I would not recommend it to anyone."
1,The LifeDrive -- My 9th Palm and Probably My Last,"I was really excited about my new LifeDrive when I bought it in November. Now I'm not a happy camper. It crashed often, taking forever to reboot. Finally, it just quit. Won't complete a charge, won't turn on, won't reset, won't make change and is too small to be a doorstop but too big to fit in a shirt pocket.I live overseas, so I've got to wait to get the U.S. to have it fixed. I hope the guarantee (and extra one I bought) will be honored and that it will be replaced on the spot.Palm let it escape before it was ready."
3,Not different enough,"As a lifelong Palm user (ok, for a brief year I did own a Clie), I find this product nice but not nice enough. Why? Because a 4GB hard drive is simply not enough of a differentiator compared to the existing PDAs (Palm or otherwise). 2 GB Flash cards are already available and by middle of next year one will be able to add a 4 GB Flash card to any PDA. At that point this would become an oddity.My T3 plays music and videos just fine. The only reason I carry an 15GB ipod is because of storage, and a Palm with 4GB is simply not enough reason to move particularly if I can wait for another year and just add flash to my PDA. Now if they can cram a 20-30 GB hard drive into this chassis, that becomes a whole new ballgame and palm would have an absolutely killer convergence product on their hands."
1,Great product. About robust as a 3 week old apple !,"Loved everything about this product, until I paid out my cash for it. After only using it for a few weeks it must have took some sort of knock in my coat pocket (yeah, yeah, my own fault, yada, yada). It's not like I was rough with it or anything but the device developed the ""Click of death"". So it is no longer ""bootable"". To be honest if the fundamental drive aspect of this device is that it is so vulnerable to shocks then I see no reason to trust my ""Life"" to it. Yet another gadget in the Gadget Drawer Of History."
3,Review of Palm Mobile Manager,"I would have liked it to be thinner and lighter, also easier to use- For example, I was used having quick notes for things to do and appointments separately-also yearly reminders in a separate list-Contacts are cumbersome to put in- and display only one thing-either phone # or email initially-emails cannot be deleted by ""selecting all""- have to be done one at a time-Does not give you enough space to make notes- such as directions to a person's house under the info-etc or store hours for the business-Love the color display and the ability to ""sync"" with bluetooth technnology-In addition to online, I would have preferred a written owner's manual as well-Overpriced for what it does-"
5,crystal earrings,"the earrings are as pictured, they look clear until you put them on with a top, then they pick up the colors around them. they are comfortable and well made and very pretty, and they came quickly even though i live in hawaii and often have problems with shipments sent parcel post (in hawaii, that means by ship!). this sender knew how to ship and paid attention to where they were going!"
5,Stunning,These were pretty on the site and gorgeous when arrived! Would definitely recommend! They are well worth the money. Bonita!
2,Beware of Romantic Crystal Earrings,"I purchased one pair of these earrings in May. At first theylooked so pretty and sparkled. In August, I ordered a second pairfor a friend. I noticed when I received her pair they were a shinysilver and have stayed that way. The silver on my pair is a lightgrey and the settings now turn my ear lobes black. I know I storedmy pair correctly. I got nowhere emailing customer service at GemAvenue. I now own a pair of earrings I cannot wear."
4,Moving,I was surprised to see this book because I read it when it first came out several years ago because of a mention in Glamour magazine. I found it moving and a little disconcerting. I was surprised that medical science still has a lot to learn about lightning strikes
3,"If you're looking for basic, then this is the book for you","However, if you're looking for a book to tell or show you new things that you've been unfamiliar with to date, then I suppose you had better look elsewhere. I'm in my mid/late twenties, and most of what was in this book was like a health course I took in college that discussed reproduction and sexuality. On the other hand, some interesting positions were mentioned that worked pretty well when my boyfriend and I tried them. For the price, it's a good deal."
2,Not the greatest guide,"I was very disappointed in this book. My longterm boyfriend and I were looking for new and interesting ideas to liven up our sex life. This book seems to be more geared for first timers or the very timid. Also, the pictures weren't explicit at all and the positions were very self explanatory so its almost as if the pictures are not needed, like in a health book with too many official names and explanations of what each part does. My opinion would be, don't waste your money unless you are looking for a cheap health lesson."
2,Did not work well. Slid on the floor.,It did not stay in place. It slid all over the floor. It is a great idea but it needs to be softer plastic or rubber or something to stay in place.
5,Norelco Cord/Cordless Rech 110/220,Great product. Got here fast. My husband loves it. Holds the charge and shaves close.
1,Every item in this book is wrong,"Never, ever use this book for reference. It isn't just occasionally or slightly wrong, but flabbergastingly, epochally inaccurate. I don't know where to begin. Dates are off by years, sometimes decades; people and places seem to be made up...I can't even begin to imagine where the ""data"" came from. If you have a copy, shred it now, before the contamination spreads. I'm not kidding."
4,Phat and all that,I've been tryin to find spanish hip-hop ever since I 've left NY and this CD is off the hook. It was worth the money.
2,frustrating toy,"This toy is very frustrating to my 4 and a half year old son. The helmet doesn't fit in such a way that it ""snaps"" on, it sort of rests over Luke's head and falls off continuously. The light-saber is really cool because it lights up, but it is very difficult for my son to get into Luke's hand. The little space suit that comes with it is just a piece of junk, it doesn't fit his waist properly and snaps off all too easily. I'm frustrated with this toy since I'm constantly having to put the light-saber back in Luke's hand or fix the space suit. My son does enjoy putting him in the X-wing that you can purchase separately, which we bought first. But I wish we had instead bought the smaller model that comes with Luke and R2-D2. That has less parts, would probably be less frustrating for all of us."
4,Nothing But the Best,"Cars to drool over that Alan De Cadenet gets to drive. The closest thing you'll come to actually driving them yourself. Excellent history of the cars, some of the drivers, designers and makers. The weakest of the series is Ford, but the rest are strong and in depth. I want one. I want one. Gi'me gi'me. Please just one. Maybe just a Ferrari... A small one without a radio. Please."
1,Coffee grinder still a mess to clean.,"Difficult to clean and still leaves coffee grounds everywhere nearby. It sounded like a good idea, but just doesn't cut it."
3,Mark my words: The next Gentle Giant,"The latest in Seattle's keyboard heavy prog-punk trend and one of the best. These guys are remarkable live, but the cd leaves something to be desired. The opening three tracks (climaxing with the killer instrumental ""Awesomolgy"") show the band's potential, while the remaider of the album lacks a certain punch. Fans of bands like Pleasure Forever should check this out."
1,i want my money back!,"I was thrilled when i first got it, however the sound was not working at all. I took it to radio shack only to find out that it doesnt work. I want my money back because my son worked hard for that money."
3,Poor quality,"The snaps on the outside broken within a few times opening the case, poor workmanship. I will rate it 3 starts though, because you could still clip it shut with the broken pieces and it will keep the cigars well."
3,"A Bit Heavy, Bulky For Travels, Etc...","I do travel a lot. I put this in my 22x14x8 carry on Victorinox suitcase & it takes up a lot of space. This cigar caddy does seal well though. In fact, so well when you open the two snaps be careful. Don't break the skin off of your thumbs or fingers! Take the inside of your thumbs while pushing up, underneath the snap levers that hold the caddy shut. It is well constructed though. Other than that, I had wished this unit was a little less heavy and for transporting ring size 50 and up, its a bit awkward in accommodating these cigars. Mine maybe holds 7 - 8 cigars because of this. I use those Boveda 72% humification packets with this. They cost about 3 - 4 bucks a piece. What else would you use?"
2,"Poorly package, came broken.","Good product for storing cigars or other smokables. However, the product came shipped in a standard envelop! Thus, it had a broken edge piece which may prevent a good seal. I had t glue the piece back and hopefully it is keep my smokables fresh."
3,The subtitle misleads,"This book is a good read, but it is not a ""guide to designing the house of your dreams.""The first half gives a good description of what an architect thinks it will be like for you to work with an architect, and is worth the read so you know what you're in for. (Note that this book and Jim Locke's The Well-Built House - from a builder's perspective disagree on some of these points)The second half is about how he designed a house with his wife as the client. It really is a ""guide to how WE designed the house of OUR dreams"".If you're contemplating a house design, go ahead and enjoy the writing, but you won't need it to help you through the process."
1,Believe the bad reviews,"Quicken is horrible. Just plain horrible. I've been fighting with this program for the last several years and have finally had enough. No more tech support calls, no more software reloads, I'm done. I just changed laptops, loaded Quicken Deluxe 2005, went to pull up my checking account file that I faithfully back up onto an external hard drive, and poof! It's gone. Oh, there's a version from February there, but that was about umpteen thousand transactions ago. User error? Maybe. But if it's that easy to lose a file, I need a new program. Goodbye, Quicken. You suck."
5,Simply perfect.,"I have read just about every book on U2. This is shorter than gems like 'One Step Closer' or 'Get Up Off Your Knees', but the best by far. The author starts with a little personal insight into his love for U2, and then uses his credible background to spin out well organized, well written chapters on various theological topics in U2. One chapter in particular, ""The Babylonian State of Zooropa"", was about the most philosophical insight into Bono's lyrics I'd ever read. Ever. It even inspired me to teach a lesson at my church based on ""Zooropa"" and ""Pop"" (which are the 2 most underrated albums ever, as the author even seems to recognize).I applauded how much and how wonderfully this little book executed in its perfectly short length. It was small; a quick read with very much insight and thought provocation. Buy it NOW."
2,Nothing but quotes from other books,"I read One Step Closer first and found it a great book. Easy to read with a lot of insightful commentary.Then I read this book and just did not like it at all. It reads like a college term paper and is nothing but quotes from other authors. I just don't see how that qualifies as a ""new book""."
4,I love it,"Great sound and battery life. Could be more comfortable, but I think most earpieces bother my ear."
2,Jabra B8010 stereo headset,"Pros: Good sound, buttons easy to pushCons: The ear piece is large and heavy and because it is not an inserted ear piece (like an ear bud), it just hangs from your ear pushing it out and competes with your eye glass frames. It is difficult to put on and never feels like it is secure or fits comfortably.I will be retiring this to the box of back up electronics and purchasing someting else. I can't comment on the stereo use because I haven't set this up yet with my phone.Score (1-10) 4Jabra BT8010 Stereo/Mono Bluetooth Headset"
4,Great but heavy,"This is my second BT8010, only because my first unit dropped out of my pocket and was run over by a car. It works as advertised. My only critisism lies in it's weight. After an hour or so it will start to annoy my ear. Maybe less options and would make the unit lighter and more comfortable to wear, but it does get the job done. Not quite 10 hours of battery life, more like six."
1,bad customer service,"I ordered 3 of them, 2 of them came without an issue, but the 1 that had problem, it got very very difficult to get it replaced, the company I ordered from told me to go to Jabra directly, at Jabra website, after entering all the info as per requested, they simply send me an email to how to resolve it and after trying that and notify them again via email (no phone #), and I've asked for an exchange and again, they replied to ask me to do the same process again, it's never ending. Bad customer service."
4,A Book Not for Everyone,"Charles Bowden certainly writes a compelling book, full of unforgettable imagery and his strong voice. His take on America's unsettling history is a huge step away from idealized grammerschool fables that many of us have been raised with, yet necessary if one is to understand world politics and America's place in them. Although frank and disturbing in some sections, Bowdens book is a very powerful read for someone looking for another persective on America. I would only recommend this book for those with strong nerves and a stong stomache. For those people it is a great book, for others, happy with a ""sunshine"" image of America, it would be better to pass on this title."
4,"The First 80% of the Book Was Excellent, the Last 20% Was Filler","This book is a flat out excellent page turner as it goes through the general histories of the regions and winemakers involved, the competition in Paris, and the aftermath of the `surprising' wins by the California wines. Highly recommended.Then Taber spends the last 20% of his book looking at a few wineries in a few wine regions around the world, and an update on the French and Napa regions since the competition in 1976. This all seems like incongruous useless filler to get the book from 240 pages to 300.Five stars for the first 80%, none for the last 20%."
5,Simply outstanding!,"I absolutely love this CD and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys thoughtful and thought-provoking music. While listeners will likely hear echoes of plenty of music they love--the Stones, Neil Young, David Bowie, and Bob Dylan, among others--all those influences have gotten mixed, bent, and twisted in wonderful ways that give the album a very distinctive sound and feel. Tim Hurley, ex-Red Red Meat and Califone, made this album with his wife, Danni Iosello, and it captures their intimate connection beautifully. This album is a wonderful listen--check it out!"
1,Not what I expected,I thought this would improve the sound of the psp a lot more than it did...I can still hardly hear it.
4,"Comprehensive, if a little redundant","I would recommend The Executor's Guide not only to people who have been (or expect to be) named executors, but to anyone preparing a will or living trust. One of the most valuable chapters, in fact, is designed to help a future executor, by listing information he or shw would need to settle your estate -- bank accounts, location of vital records, etc. For those who are about to go through probate or distribute property held in trust, the book literally gives step-by-step instructions, all with a minimum of legalese and jargon. My only criticism is that some ideas -- even whole paragraphs -- are repeated in different chapters. But if you don't intend to read the book cover to cover, that wouldn't be a problem (and it might not bother you even if you do)."
4,Executor's Guide:Settling A Loved One's Estate,This book was informative and served as a good guide for getting started on settling an estate. It also was easy to understand.
3,Shy Child - 'One With The Sun' (Say Hey Records),"Best described as 'indie electronic' rock.Shy Child is an act that's been at it since 2000.Pretty much a duo,made up of Pete Cafarella-keyboards&vocals and Nate Smith-drums.Didn't care too much for most of the vocals here,but I think I liked the playing and song arrangements more.Some of the tunes I found to my liking were ""Sunshine""(maybe the CD's best track),""Break Your Neck"",""Echo And Throb"" the title cut ""One With The Sun"".This CD will likely grow on you with each repeated play.I've heard this duo is a fun act to catch live,as I could actually picture just that.Might appeal to some fans of Touchdown,Modest Mouse or The Rapture."
5,At Last,"As a UK fan of Love Bondage and simular material, I've waited for years to obtain a copy of this book. I can assure all wondering about the purchase that the wait was well worth it. The quality of the illustrations is exelent and there is plenty of bonus material contained within it's bulging covers. Well done the publishers, you made a UK fan very happy this Chrstmas!"
5,Well recommended,Much vaunted by the modern British Bizarre magazine and worththe outlay. It's a shame it's so hard to get hold of... Very well done etc.
5,Nice deal.,I actually just bought these just to have some new ones around when the time comes. I currently use an electric toothbrush but it's too soft so I guess I will go with these once the brush is worn down on the electric tooth-brush.
3,reach toothbrushes,"I LOVE using Reach toothbrushes, and the pricing was great on this product. It wasn't exactly the item that I wanted, I wanted the thicker/broader handled toothbrush that Reach makes. (I cannot locate that style anywhere.) This product still serves my purpose, even though it still isn't quite the one that I was looking for...(obviously I'm a stickler about certain items, and I do still 'sweat the small stuff')."
4,His best album,"Yo' forget the other review he doesn't know what he's talkin about. This album is tight. Pizzo comes tight on the mic and the beats are gangsta. My fav track is ""Off tha Hinges"" and ""Major Factors."" If you want some real gangsta rap then get Dosia ""Waiting to Inhale."" That album is almost too hardcore! But ""Heater Calhoun"" is coo. It's better than all his other albums in my opinion."
3,"Looks Great, Toasts Poorly","I purchased this toaster after returning the VillaWare Uno. I really like the design and it's much more compact than the Uno.The performance of my unit left a lot to be desired. The tosting elements did not heat uniformly, and the toast was overdone on the bottom half and too light on the top. There is also a bit too much space between the elements, so the toast ends up with a patchy appearance.If only the unit's performance matched its excellent design. I hated to do it, but I returned it.[...]"
1,Great for everything except toasting.,"Much of the time, you get what you pay for. I found this toaster to be a notable exception. While it looks pretty good in my kitchen, its actual ability to toast is very poor. The two slots on the left can be set for bagels. However, they also do not toast regular slices of toast very much. The two slots on the right side are merely passable. The toasting cycles take a long time and sometimes you need more than 1 cycle to get good medium-done toast. I am shopping for a new toaster within 6 months of buying this one. However, if you want a pretty prop for your kitchen, this is the toaster for you."
1,design over function,"what a great disappointment this toaster turned out to be! the design is wonderful, visually. but it's a lousy toaster -- especially for the price. the slots aren't long enough for most bread, so we have to squish our bread in. it takes way too long to toast. and when the toast comes out, only the bottom 2/3 is toasted. i got suckered into buying this by the sharp design and the normally trustworthy name. it's just baffling that someone in the quality assurance dept at T-Fal didn't put a stop on this low-quality product."
2,Buy this only if you want to get BURNED,"Inexcusable for an appliance in this price range. All looks, no functionality. Takes forever, and as many people mentioned, the top elements don't even heat up, resulting in burnt bottoms (for the toast as well as the consumer). My first and last TFAL appliance."
2,Looks Great But Levers Broke In Less Than 1 Year!,"Unfortunately, the little levers that you use to push the bread/bagel further up to grip it more easily have broken after less than a year. Sometimes, the lever seems to be stuck against something else so you can't depress them, other times, you depress the lever and the bread does not rise. *shrug* The toaster looks great and still does a good job of toasting but the levers should not break after less than a year of owning the item and the item does NOT receive daily usage."
1,Bad Right Out of the Box,"I bought the T-fal because of the name and the cool design. I opened it up, plugged it in, and could not get the handles to stay down. After a few minutes I was able to get them to stay down. The toasting took a long time (longer than my old one.)and when I tried to get it to toast again one of the handles would not stay down at all. The T-Fal 800 number I called was confusing, since none of the computer operated options directed me to getting answers about broken appliances. I returned the item the same day I got it."
1,hope this model is improved,"We bought this toaster 6 mos ago. From the picture it looks like they have re-done it a bit - I sure hope so. I am back online to buy a new toaster because my day is ruined just by looking at the one that we have. It feels cheap, one of the push up slots stopped working after a month or so, it toast irregularly when you have all four slots working (why have four if they aren't going to work at the same time?), and it is huge. Typically I use an appliance until it drops before I replace it, but not this time. I can't wait to drop this one in the trash."
2,Wish they were balanced better,"Purchased these to go on my normal pedals for a little extra power. They weight the pedal to the front, so when you take your foot off, the pedal drops nose down. It makes finding your footing difficult after coming to a stop, and they are long enough that taking a curve with the nose down will scrape the pavement. I plan to get some fishing weight or something to glue into my pedals to balance them better. They flex, but do seem durable enough (considering I've scraped them off the pavement a few times going around a curve!) I'd give this product 2.5 stars."
2,The Company Let Me Down,"Companies need to provide detailed information on their products so buyers outside of an ""in-group"" can decide if products unfamiliar to them might be adapted for their own special needs. From the picture provided, I thought I could use these toe clips on my exercise bike. The Delta Company failed to provide any significant information beyond a photograph. I ordered a pair anyway, thinking information included with the toe clips would suffice. In addition to having no text details before ordering, the toe slips arrived without information in the package. I cannot use the toe clips on my exercise bike and wonder if I might mount them on mahogany blocks and sell them to tourists as the miniature sculptures that are ""all the rage among art lovers."""
2,Great ... if your big toe is the same size as your little toe,"They do what they are supposed to, but they are symmetrical while most feet are not. On the big-toe side, your foot will be smushed, and the little-toe side, too loose."
1,Flawed,"This ball head is rated for 4.4 pounds but when using it in vertical position with my 200mm lens, the camera slips. My equipment weight is only 3.5 pounds, so I consider that a flaw and was planning to return it.The trouble is, the ball head is so extremely lightweight, I barely notice the weight of it, along with the Gitzo legs (Gitzo GT0531 Series 0 6X Carbon Fiber 3-Section Tripod with G-Lock), when carrying them in my camera backpack. The next size up is considerably heavier and larger, so much so that the tripod weight becomes noticeable. So even though it doesn't perform up to spec, I can't bring myself to return it.UPDATE: Perhaps the ballhead was completely flawed from the start. While using it with a much lighter 17-40 lens a month after writing this review, it slipped out of lock permanently. It's no longer usable and no longer under the return period. Looking into the Gitzo warranty it's not even clear if it is covered since ""This Warranty does not cover labor costs"". ???"
5,Seminal Work,"This is a book I read many years ago that literally changed my life. Highly recommend to people interested in Jung and particularly Marie-Louise von Franz. Penetrating insight. You'll never read ""Le Petit Prince"" the same way again."
1,Avoid this recording!,"As I listened to this recording, I had to ask myself, does Lorin Maazel hate this piece? Does he hate music? From the beginning, his tempi are unbearably slow. Where the tempi are not problematic, his approach strikes me as unconvincingly mannered.The sound is also poor. While I'm a fan of many live recordings, the balances on this one are a mess. Consequently, the glories of Puccini's instrumentation are lost.Nor can I say that the singing redeems the shortcomings I've pointed out.My advice: if this your first Turandot, shuck out the extra money for theNilsson/Scotto/Corelli recording."
5,Delicious,"I like chocolate and almonds. Like all chocolate and almond lovers, we are glad someone can finally put those two class acts together in on little itty bitty bar of wholesome chocolaty goodness."
5,Love this crib!,"I love this crib. I have twins and bought two for my boys. They are 8 months old now and I have not had any issues with this crib. Although one of the crib's siderail was harder to raise and lower than the other crib, I found that if you make sure that the legs are aligned correctly that the rail moves up and down a lot easier.Assembly for this crib was a snap! I love the color and the sturdiness of it has yet to be a concern of mine."
2,Ibook,"The company who sold me the Ibook sent it with the keys coming out, and the trackpad doesn't work; I have to use a mouse. When I took it to a technician to fix, I was told the wiring was done wrong which he had to rewire and had to pay to fix."
2,Horrible customer care,This company has the worse customer care ever. I wanted to return the computer because it ran very slow and did not meet my needs to my satisfaction. When returning the item I got one of the worst customer care providers ever. I will never by or suggest anyone buying from them
3,Nice if your an apple person,"Received this product and i had some problems, the airport card wasnt functioning so i bought a new one, then the computer needed software, which i didnt figure in having to purchase. So, for me it was disappointing, but i sold it to my sitter, and she got a great deal, she was very pleased to own an apple, i was very happy to go back to my pc w/microsoft fuctions. So, guess its up to you, if your an apple fan, and already familiar this is a great product, and for those of us who havent a clue about the apple software etc..this is a real pain to convert. I have to say it was nice and small, and for me that was what i wanted for my college work, and it was light weight."
3,Refurbished Apple iBook G3,"This iBook did not work as described by the seller. It was freezing most of the time. Also, I could not access wireless internet, and I could not watch any video on it."
2,A Good Laptop But Horrible Service,"After about a week the hinges on my Apple iBook G3 popped out. So my laptop screen couldn't hold itself up. So I tried to get it repaired but East Coast Macs said it was a ""hard"" job, so they offered a replacement laptop for $69.95 after I paid $170 for laptop and shipping. So after they offered the replacement laptop, when I called they would ignore my phone calls. But when I called on a different phone they answered. So I just got a refund. Overall the Apple iBook G3 is a great laptop but East Coast Macs is a unreliable, horrible company."
1,Below Expectations,"The two main problems with this low-priced Mac iBook is that it has an operating system (Mac OS X 10.4.11) that is too old to support any basic download (Flash, Adobe, Foxfire...); and with a processor of G3 and below 900 Mhz, it will not support an OS upgrade (even if you were willing to pay $100 - $450 for the upgrade disc).If I was to say something positive about this item, This makes a very nice ""Word Processor"" . You can use it to check email, facebook, and casual web-surfing--just as long as you don't want to watch videos (llke on YouTube or forwarded email)--And it is definitely not for ""gamers"".I would not say that at $200 it is ""overpriced,"" but don't expect to be making movies and skyping."
2,OK produt / Vendor is a cheat,"The apple computer was received as advertised, although the vendor failed to say there was no wireless card or that the OS system would have to be upgraded for most of todays technology. If you wanted to use just a word program or a few other simple programs it would be fine but did not meet my needs.Tried to contact the vendor several times to ask to return item and get money back as advertised. Vendor never called, returnned e-mail messages or letter.Stay away from the Mac Specialist!"
2,not what i really wanted,it want connect to the internet too old to use I will not buy anything else like it not satified
3,"Love the movie, but hate the voice over.","I love the movie, but hate the voice over kills the originality. I would prefer the original voice with subtitle."
1,Risky purchase,"Tried these while on holiday in Germany. Used my Iphone map to locate medieval castle from a high promentory, but was directed to look instead at what turned out to be a Baltic nudist retiree beach resort.In fantastically detailed, stable and sharp horror, I was confronted with wrinkled, hairy images that dazzled even as they nauseated.Great optics and build quality that reveal the Matrix-like horror beneath our reality.You have been warned..."
5,A wonderful Reference Book!,"After purchasing the book, I was amazed at how many applications are already available for the Mac OS X. No one can say the Mac OS X doesn't have enough software written for it. The software disk is a big plus as well. Good job Robert!"
2,EXTREMELY poor formatting,"This version of ""The Angel in the House"" is from the Gutenberg Project. When transformed for the Kindle, it is EXTREMELY poorly done. Every other line is indented per the poem's format, but in the Kindle version, this indent comes through as a series of ""???????"" presumably one for every space of indent. The result is that this version is nearly unreadable on the Kindle. Instead of a pleasant reading experience, you're constantly fighting the poor formatting. I realize that it's only $0.99, but still...live a little and spend just a bit more to get a copy you can actually read."
3,"Pretty good, but watch out for the wheels","I bought two of these for my twin daughters. One turned out fine, but the other one had a problem with the seat. Badger sent a replacement part within a few days. So, customer service is good, however, some parts of the stroller are so cheap. Watch out for the parts that hold the wheels in place. These parts are very fragile and I have already had to replace them once because it cracked when I was putting it on. Order a few replacement parts for when they do break. One other thing to be aware of is the back of the stroller seat that goes up and down from a reclining position to the sitting up position. The fabric constantly separates from the bar so you have to fix it each time. And, just a product improvement, the carrier part to the stroller does not have an easily adjustable arm so if you want it to go down or adjust it, you have to remove the side screws to do this."
4,Naive love story,"Really just a naive love story that's not exactly well-executed but enjoyable nonetheless. The first third of the movie was somewhat silly to me, but once I accepted the flaws (mainly the odd acting and not-to-realistic plot) I found it touching and sweet. It has the same sentiment as James Iha's solo album (nobody knows what I'm talking about, I know)."
4,"a good pan, but one drawback...","This pan makes it easy for me to prepare one-pot meals, and the larger surface area is really helpful in browning meats, preparing dumplings, etc. Another plus is that, because of the shape, it fits easily on the stovetop next to another large pot. The only drawback I've found is that, unlike a round pan, the lid can fall into the dish. It made quite a mess when I dropped it into the chili I was making - so I'll definitely have to be more careful next time!"
3,Could be more sound absorbant,"And after a while, a the glue on a few of the sheets failed for those that were stacked from ceiling."
1,"Excellent design idea, extremely poor engineering","The ideas incorporated in this drum key including the keychain quick-release and flip feature are fantastic, but I've had to consecutively return two of these keys within a few weeks of initially ordering it. The swivel/quick-release mechanism is so weak it will fall apart after using it only a few times. If only Evans knew who I was.... shame shame Evans."
1,"Good idea, bad drum key","The drum key is a very good idea but recently, I was walking to class and the drum key disassembled itself from where it attaches to the keychain. I was surprised because i was not doing anything to the drum key. It does move a lot when i walk, i constantly hear it jingle and jangle but i thought nothing of it. Like i said, recently the pin that holds it together disassembled and now I am wondering whether Guitar Center can fix this or should I contact Amazon (where i bought it from) and get a new one."
5,a wonderful resource,"This book is a must have for any magical cabinet. The book not only tells you what scents to use for your spells but also things to be aware of (ie. toxic oils, natural v. sinthetic, etc.) if your are going to buy only one Aromatherapy book this should be it!!!!"
1,newage sewage,"I really like Cunningham, and I really hated this book. I think it's the worst under his name.I really am not sure that this book has any use at all beyond maybe making your house smell good.It requires you to accept a number of beliefs about the power of smell with little evidence behind them...."
2,Disappointing,Didn't keep my interest. Found it hard to finish. Maybe I was spoiled by recently reading some old Grisham books. This is no comparison.
3,Chill or trip - it's your call.,"It's a shame those two Beach Boys albums didn't sell well at the time of their release. Granted, neither of them are Pet Sounds (but then again, this masterpiece didn't sell well at the time either), but they're not bad at all. Smiley Smile sometimes makes you cringe (if you ever had the opportunity to listen to the original tracks of songs like ""Wonderful"" and ""Heroes and villains"", you know what I'm talking about), but the whole ""Stoned"" atmosphere of it is never less than amusing. And Wild Honey is a fine ""back to basics"" album, with pretty good attempts at doing a bit of blue-eyed R n B. If you're at least a bit ""initiated"" on the sound of the BB, you should enjoy both of them."
1,Monophonic recordings,"My review is about the sound quality, not about the music itself. I bought this because I was curious about Smiley Smile, and already owned the vinyl LP version of Wild Honey but figured the sound quality of the digital recording would of course be better.I was wrong! Except for the very last track (a bonus track, ""Can't Wait Too Long"") all the material on this CD, including ""Good Vibrations,"" is in MONO! Even though the cover art - reproducing that of the vinyl LP - says ""For STEREO phonographs"" leaving me to suspect that Capitol Records intentionally tricked people into buying this. What a disappointment."
5,SIlver Bullet,"Excellent writing....A daring and dangerously honest dive into the inner feelings and emotions that so often enter into the trials and challenges people face, in todays rollercoaster of life. Good read for any age."
3,"Expected More ""Book""","I wasn't really impressed with this book at all. It didn't really read smoothly or keep me hooked like other books i've read, example; Pendulum Power. I was also VERY bummed to see that more than HALF of the book is not book at all! Its drawings of charts! The ""so called"" book is 206 pages long but the book ACTUALLY ENDS on page 79!! I would not personally recommend this to any of my friends.SUMMARY: If you are looking for a nice pendulum book full of interesting facts to further your learning process, don't buy this book.NOW, if you want to buy a ""folder"" full of pendulum tables definately buy this book!!!"
3,Downton Abby?,The local county newspaper said it was as good as Downton Abby. It wasn't. I could only watch a few episodes!
3,No como lo esperaba...,"Creo que este es el único album donde Jaguares pierde ese misticismo que lo caracteriza. Quizá como es acústico? En general es bueno, pero pudo haber sido mejor."
4,First Kid - with Sinbad,The Brock Pierce that played the first kid wasn't really the best and the Zachery Ty Bryan from home improvments sucked because Brock Pierce really kind of suck in his acting. But with Sinbad it made it a ok to kind of good movie.
4,Little Mommy loves it,"I gave this to my 23 month old grandaughter and she loved it she put her baby into and marched right down the hall into the tv room and back. she had no trouble turning it even though the front wheels don't turn. It is just the right size for her and light enough for her to play with. She can work the velcro to ""buckle"" her baby in and she loves the little cargo net on the bottom to hold babies bottle etc. It was so easy to assemble too and they give you extra parts in case you need them. at one point my grandaughter even sat (it clearly states not to use for children or pets) in it holding her baby and ""feeding"" it. It was well worth the money she is having a ball with it."
4,STROLLER,"REALLY FAST SHIPPING, EXACTLY AS STATED, WOULD DEFINITELY BUY AGAIN FROM THIS SELLER. SMOOTH TRANSACTION, HAPPY CUSTOMER. BRAND NEW AS DESCRIBED. MY GIRL ENJOYED IT, TILL IT BROKE."
3,Good but no Wow,"In my search for ole 60's music of worth to have in my collection I added this album for the song ""She Cried"". I was slightly dissappointed with the album as a whole. She Cried, Come a Little Bit Closer, This Magic Moment and Cara Mia are very good, Tomorrow, and others are pretty good, but i was left with no Wow, this is great. Ok, maybe I went wow on come a little bit closer. If your a big fan of Jay & the Americans from back in the day, then I'm sure you'll love this best of collection. These are the short pop tunes of the 60's variety, but with more complex (somewhat ahead of their time)big band type arrangements on most of the songs. Jay has a really gifted singing voice that delivers. I guess this is not quite up to rock n roll status enough for me and not all the songs do anything for me. However, there are alot of super songs in this collection for a solid 3 to 4 stars. If you like boy/girl romantic pop songs of the 60's than this will be a very good buy for you."
2,Okay maybe I was a little harsh,"Originally I gave this one star, but I think two is more reasonable as there are some decent moments on here. Still, I got this cd because I loved their version of ""This Magic Moment"" so I was very disappointed that nothing else on here grabbed nearly as much. At one point in the liner notes Jay Traynor says how he didn't understand why their version of ""This Magic Moment"" ranked higher than The Drifters, and after listening to this cd I would agree that The Drifters were a much better group. While I was disappointed, this guy can sing alright and I am giving one more star because I love their version of ""This Magic Moment""."
3,Oldie but Goodie,I've always liked Jay and the Americans. I was a little disappointed in this CD though. Too much music that I've never even heard before. Could have made the CD with 11-12 songs out of 28.
3,Nice classic,"I haven't had one of these since I was a kid 45 years ago. It is still fun, but not as powerful as I remembered. If you want power go for stomp rockets! It is hard for a kid to pump it enough to get much distance. An adult can shoot the rocket about 40', my 12 year old only about 15 - 25."
2,They don't build em like they used to....,"Probably good enough for young kids, but they don't build em like they used to....I was ecstatic to find this item on Amazon but this is definitely not the same little red, rigid-plastic, water rocket with a sturdy, metal-shafted pump that I had 25 years ago. For starters, the rockets are constructed with lighter plastic. But the pump is where the problems really lie.The shaft is plastic and seems like it will break. That would not be so bad except that air and water begin to leak after 5 pumps. I purchased two sets and both pumps have identical issues. The air did not leak on the older version and the rocket would travel at least 25 feet (I remember many a > 20 fooot roof-top retrieval ventures) vertically. Now you are lucky if it goes over 15 feet.The rockets are distinctly lighter as well. I remember mine crashing nose-first onto the cement with a thud whereas these flay in the wind and gingerly fall on their sides."
5,STEPHEN KING'S BEST FILM YET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,THIS MOVIE IS ABSOLUTELY THE BEST! THE MYSTERIOUS MAN (LINOGE) WAS COMPLETELY INTRIGUING AND SPOOKY...YOU NEVER KNEW WHAT HE WAS GOING TO DO NEXT!! GREAT STORY LINE TOO! ANYONE WHO LIKES A SUSPENSEFUL/ SCARY MOVIE HAS TO SEE 'STORM OF THE CENTURY'. GO GET IT TODAY!!
4,Storm Of The Century,"This movie is a slow starter. The second half of the movie is a real sitting on the edge of your seat, but for whatever reason make sure you pause the movie before you get up or else you will be totally lost when you come back."
3,A fun movie to watch,"I do not want to spoil the movie so I will omit the telling details. Let me just say that I really liked the villian in this picture, and I enjoyed the fact that they blurred the line between right and wrong... even up to the end.If you like strong bad guys, this is the movie for you."
1,Trashy mess.,"I watched this with my brother because nothing else that was on TV at the time was good and we were terribly disappointed. This is a definite miss for Stephen King, whose material I normally enjoy to watch on screen. The film was too cold and depressing for me and it also got very redundant. I could go on but I want to keep it short. My recommendation is to avoid this. If you want to see a good Stephen King TV program watch The Stand, The Shining, Salem's Lot (1979), and Nightmares & Dreamscapes."
3,Better than I expected,"Actually, I'm giving it three and a half stars. The reasons why I don't give it four, are because 1)You never find out what 'croaton' means (it seems 'cheap' to just throw in a mysterious word, never to have it fully explained) and 2) It reminded me too much of 'Needful Things', which, in my opinion, is one of King's absolutely worst works ever, both the book and the movie. Oh, and the fact that this movie took place on the same island as 'Dolores Claiborne' was also slightly annoying, as 'D.C' is an excellent true-to-life tale, and it just didn't seem right to have the Devil or somesuch visit that place.Overall, it's an entertaining movie - though I, personally, liked 'Rose Red' better...guess I'm just a sucker for haunted house stories..:o)"
3,"Storm of the Century - turn up the fire, light the lights","Even if I hadn't known Stephen King was the author of this 250 minute movie, I would probably have guessed. The attention to intricate detail which means a long movie (you can't leave anything out) is one of the hallmarks of King's work. The convention of the dark stranger who seems to know a small town's intimate secrets is a popular one with King, and although this is not a ""scary"" movie as such, it still has the suspense you'd expect. The acting is professional and workmanlike, if not Oscar material, and the scenery (of which the weather is the star) is lovely. If I could be sure I wouldn't be snowed in for days with a bad guy, I'd like to go and visit this little Maine island. My eighteen year old son and myself spent a lovely cold and miserable afternoon watching this movie."
2,Like 99% of Stephen Kings movies-a waste of time!,"The first half of this movie is fairly interesting, and does keep you wondering what is going on. But at the end as with most of Mr. King;s movies it all falls apart, and leaves you angry that you invested so much time in watching this garbage. Master of Horror? I think not. This movie just didn't make much sense to me."
4,awesome and economical,"although when filling you have to hold at an angle, this tank is awesome for developing one roll at a time!"
5,Great! Thrilling!,"It was phenomenal! This was a capturing, action filled video. It shows real stories and real videos of what happened. Buy it today!!!"
5,Terrific fun for homeschoolers,"This kit comes with feathers to make quills to write with 9looks like caligraphy when you write), Goldenrod paper to do an experiment from the scene when Harry writes in Tom Riddle's diary and the ink disappears and reappears, plus your standard clear wax crayon and watercolors wax resist experiment and a poster. Highly recommended for lots of fun!!"
3,The Ventures - Walk Don't Run,When I heard an old Ventures tune recently nostalga set in and I ordered this album. Unfortunately my appetite for their music has changed or they are simply not as good as I remembered.
1,Goodbye to the best Lemon Cake ever,"I have been a purchaser of Miss Grace Lemon Cakes for years; they were thee best lemon cake ever with rich icing and quality lemony cake. However, they have recently been taken over by Cheryl's and the difference is startling. First the cake no longer comes in a tin but a box; the first one I rec'd had virtually no icing and looked like it had been sitting on a shelf for a week. When I complained, they sent me a new one for free with a slight improvement. Sadly, goodbye to my favorite lemon cake of all time."
4,My Six Year-Old Really Likes it... Sometimes,"This doesn't get played with as frequently as I would have thought, but when she does use it she really seems to enjoy it. We got the 1st grade cartridge and that's been very popular. It has been dropped several times and been through multiple 6 year-old girl vs. 3 year-old girl tug-o-wars and seems none the worse for the wear."
1,Words of wisdon from a butcher,"In this book, Frist admits to adopting homeless animals from Boston shelters and promising to keep them as pets, only to bring them home to vivisect and eventually kill. The fact that he was a medical student is no excuse - he knew it was wrong, not to mention illegal, otherwise he would have no need for secrecy. Didn't he get enough dissection and vivisection in his medical school classes? Apparently not. I don't buy his explanation that the clandestine torture and killing of these animals was done to further his studies - if that were the case, he would have done the experiements IN SCHOOL under the SUPERVISION of a professor. Yes, it's impressive that he was a medical student - he is obviously intelligent. However, the frenzied, repeated torture and killing points of these adopted animals points to an deviant character, pure and simple."
5,Excellent Read,"This book provided a fascinating insight into the amazing world of transplants. I take my hat of to Dr. Frist and his colleagues for the amazing work they do day in and day out!!I think too many previous reviewers focused too much on the cat story. Back when Dr. Frist was going to medical school, dogs and cats from shelters were commonly used for a variety of classes in medical school - I do not think we should judge Dr. Frist's actions on today's standards."
1,Really bad,"This movie was selected because it only cost 99 cents. I overpaid, it was not worth 10 cents."
5,New life for a razor that was falling apart,"I was ready to spring $150 for a new Norelco when I decided to check for a replacement head holder. My old Norelco now works like new...and I have $130 left in my pocket. Now, that's a win..win!"
2,Didn't like what i got,I did not like the buttons much. It was very hard to find the pairs. Also some of the buttons were broken and some were dirty. I might be able to use only less than 1/3 of the buttons.
2,Something Is Missing,"The first book I ever read by Homes was The End of Alice. I went into Mother trying not to compare the topics or the material, but expecting to see some of the flare Homes had in Alice, and Music for Torching; unfortunately, it fell short. Country of Mothers is a wonderful idea, a psychologist believing a client is her long lost daughter she gave up for adoption 23 years earlier, but poorly executed. The characters have conflicting actions to motivation, and are one dimensional at best. It seems Homes had not yet found her voice or talent for creating engrossing characters and motivations. I found myself fighting the urge to flip forward several pages at a time, certain I would not miss any plot twists, since they were few and far between. I encourage fans of Alice to read Mother if for no other reason then to see the very aparent evolution of a writer, as it is obvious Homes was not at her best during In the Country of Mothers."
2,Dont bother.,"Bought this from a local wally world and it was one of the more expensive engine degreasers. It cleans decently but its hard to gauge because the bottle was out before i could even spray my entire camry's engine bay!! It shoots outs in a foam but is not enough to cover sufficiently and ledt grease marks on the engine even after following directions to the T. Spend your money elsewhere, the foam is nice but a standard spray gives just as good coverage and has more product."
2,Interesting yet boring,"The motivation for the eco-terrorist' attack is absolutely improbable and absurd. The cardboard characters lack any depth. Read this as a fast comic book type action/adventure only. The technical& science aspects are well done, especially the diving sequences, however the predictable plot and lack of characterization makes this an unsatisfying read."
1,I lost my money,"It wrote just a few words before to stop working. That's all. This is the 2nd time this happens, the prevous time I though it was a particular case, you know, things happen... but twice?"
5,Liked Celestine Prophecy? Wait till you read THIS book!,"""Quest For Truth "" is filled with many enlightening prespectives that I believed in for years as a medical Professional. This book allows you to see new ways of exploring personal growth and it offers many ideas of profound inspiration. It urges us to trust ourselves,each other and our creativity. There's a lot of good humor in this book...anytime you are doing what you love to do and are laughing, it gives you more confidence.""Quest For Truth"" has tools for everyone to ""build and repair"" their lives and to know that what you believe--makes a big difference in your life. In my work I am often helping people who are facing end-of -life issues. I*highly* recommend Chapter 4 ""Death,Dying & Religion""to both patients and health care professionals. An extraordinary book that helped me change my life for the better . These ideas can work for you as well. Elaine Glazer, R.N."
3,Re-inflated.,"It worked fine at first, but didn't stay sealed very well. After a few hours it had re-inflated, so while everything is contained in the bag (which is good) it doesn't save any space."
1,RUINED my brand new comforter!!!!!,"If I could give this a negative 100 score I would. I put my brand new (dry clean only) Tommy Hilfiger comforter in one of these bags for the summer. It was too heavy to use year round. At the end of the summer, we got it out and the smell was TERRIBLE. AWFUL. It stinks up the whole room and anything it touches. I have paid to have it dry cleaned three times and the smell will not go away. We are going to try to regular wash it as a last resort but they REALLY should warn people about this. There's $200 down the drain. THANKS A LOT"
1,Terrible,I bought some and thought they worked so I bought more but when I checked under bed the were deflated. One out of 8 worked. I had already thrown packages out so I now learned a lesson. Save package until you see that it lasts for a week or longer.
5,"If You Love Cattleyas, You Must Have This Book","The book is fantastic, well written and great pictures. It goes through the large flowered cattleyas and laelias one by one, in the order in which they were introduced to the European market. The history behind the species is fascinating and the specific cultural requirements of each cattleya species is addressed along with a brief of their use in hybridizing. The general cultural chapter is also excellent. My only regret is they didn't get to the bifoliates, maybe in the next book!"
2,Wonderful recording but terrible packaging,"This is a glorious recording of a charming opera, Massenet's best music, in my opinion, with exception of Thais.However, the cover art is trashy (the original one had lovely Von Stade in a blue dress runing (presumably at twelve midnight). This disc has no information whatever, no libretto, no pictures, no summary. Opera d'oro, much less expensive, has plot summaries and information in its cds. Too bad I don't still have my box set.But Von Stade and Welting are in wonderful voice as is Gedda and the whole opera and recording is a delight from beginning to end."
4,Just Kind of There..,"Joanna's latest album ""This Crazy Life,"" is now available. The Geffen recording artist has a mellow voice and as a whole her album falls along the lines of an early Kelly Clarkson or a Hilary Duff. This fall she will be touring with Nick Lachey.This Crazy Life,"" is a safe mix of pop/semi-rock tracks.""Let It Slide,"" is a mid-tempo track. ""Ultraviolet"" is a mid-tempo song that opens with a children's choir singing. ""Broken"" is a song which relies on strong vocals. The title track is a song with a haunting track about abuse.There is nothing really remarkable or unremarkable about Joanna's album. It's easily forgettable. It's just kind of there. I wish I could say there was that one song that really stood out. She has a beautiful voice. Hopefully on her next album she will hook up with some different songwriters and producers. She has amazing potential."
4,"Welcome back "" BAND""","I recently bought the Jubilation CD. It is a fine piece of work that only the Band could make. It brings back old time Band music but only wish we had a little Robbie Robertson on guitar, although the musicians on here are Excellent ! Eric Clapton plays on a song on here, although it is hard to distinguish that it is him playing. Well anyway buy this if you like the down home funkiness that only Levon Helm and the Band can make. My only regret on buying this CD is that I didn`t by it here on line at Amazom.com"
1,What a disappointment,This book is absolute garbage!The whole book is a tutorial with a lot of example problems for the user to solve. That's great!! The problem is when they LEAVE OUT very important measurements for you to complete the examples. So I've spent hours and hours working on one and now I can't finish it because they've FAILED to inlcude some very key data. Good job Thomson Learning!! You've successfully pushed yet another incomplete book out the door without so much as a decent proof read. Unbelieveable!!
3,"If you're into mixed bag albums, you might like this one","Don't Explain is an eclectic mix of rock, traditional pop, R&B and jazz that works most of the time. Unfortunately, the rock selections are it weakest link. Songs like ""Your ma should've told ya"" and ""Your amazing"" might prove that he doesn't have the fire for rock that he had in the 1980's. However, ""Light years"" with its sinister groove is the best of the bunch. The Marvin Gaye tribute medley is great as is his interpertation of Billie Holiday's ""Don't explain"" and ""Your my trill"" are fantastic. As a whole, this album isn't for the casual Palmer fan, but if you love his mixed bag approach, you'll like this album."
1,These are awful.,"I have had the black and the white versions, and the colored dot with the number wore off very quickly, even though it said on the package that it was ""guaranteed not to wear off!"" So, of course I called the company, who to their credit promptly sent me a new set, whose numbers again wore off. I'm still left guessing if I'm using the correct cup because now, a couple years later, there is no sign that there was ever even a number on them. I'm writing this review today because I'm finally buying a new set in a different brand. I also had trouble with OXO's stainless steel cups."
5,Great,"I really like these measuring cups. I was pretty worried about buying them at first because you never no for sure if the cups you have are accurate. They work fine and even though there plastic there not flimsy. I love the size, it's not the typical 4 size cups, and there are 6 different sizes and an egg separator. And after cooks gave a good recommendation on these measuring cups I was really satisfied with purchasing them."
4,They're accurate,"I'm a scientist, so the first thing I did was to test the accuracy of these cups. I placed them on a scale and weighed how much water each one held (1 gram of water = 1 milliliter). I'm happy to report that all of the cups held pretty close to what is stated. Since accuracy is the most important part of a measurement tool, I give it 4 stars for coming through.However, I'm not a fan of plastic, so I'm still going to reach for my metal cups by choice. Unless I'm baking, in which case, a gram scale is really the only way to go."
3,Clunky and cheap,"These measuring cups stack nicely, have grippy handles, and have six different sizes including the 3/4 cup size, which is nice to have. They are a nice scoop shape so they are easy to use. I use mine for dog food and cat food portioning. They are fine if you want cheap everyday set up cups that won't break like glass or cost you a fortune like stainless steel. While useful, I find them to be unremarkable, with no distinguishing features. I think they are clunky and ugly-looking and went back to using my Tupperware set with the sizes stamped into the cup bottom. These will make a great back up set in case my Tupperware are dirty."
5,Chloe Rocks!!!,"I received a copy of this DVD when it was only available at the Celtic Woman concerts. I didn't know thatChloe had a DVD, so a very generous fan was kind enough to send me a copy.This DVD is a must for any Chloe fan! It is nice to see Chloe in her own clothes, instead of the lovely gowns that she wears at the concerts. The DVD is shot in Ireland, and the scenery is beautiful!!! I can't recommend thisDVD highly enough."
4,Chloe's Heartsongs,"This DVD is a real treat for any Chloe fan. Chloe's singing is soft and dreamy, and her expressions and gestures natural. Her overal performance is unaffected and sincere. Filmed at various locations in Ireland, Chloe seems more Irish than I ever saw her in the sunlight, her cheeks rosy and her face shiny. Somehow she seems more Irish in these settings than in her studio photographs. The camera men could have been more imaginative, and some of Chloe's outfits looked too casual, however. I have Frank Patterson's Songs of Inspiration video, which was also filmed in Ireland, and I can't help comparing the filming of it with that of Walking in the Air. There's a lot to love anyway, though. I pop this in to watch a few songs almost every day, as it really inspires me. Great job Chloe!"
5,Cletic Woman Music Lover,Chloe is a wonderful talented singer/preformer holding up the tradition of the traditional music of the Irish Countryside.
4,Great songs but production could have been better,"I absolutely love Chloe!! (and her deep blue eyes), but many of the videos are poorly shot. She has her hair blowing in her face often, and it looks like there was only 1 or 2 cameras taping her. Some of the scenery is nice; some of her outfits are nice too, BUT... not all of them. Overall if you like Chloe you will still enjoy this DVD and hearing the songs, but the budget for this DVD was undercut."
3,Under the Desert Moon,"I found this book to be tedious and began scanning. Although it has potential, I found it lacked readability."
3,Disappointing,"There are a number of good suggestions in this book, however, I found it very long and involved (almost like a reworking of a master's thesis), reducing its usefulness for younger children (and I mean under age 13 or so). I also did not like the political overtones (pacifism as a personal and especially a national policy has limited usefulness, in my opinion). I also did not like the artwork--it seemed like the result of ""art therapy,"" and ultimately did not serve to help empower or inculcate a more positive outlook in the ""target audience,"" again in my opinion."
3,ok,I found good use for the bag I was able to salavage as one had a slow leak. I have not used it long term yet so I can not say how it is.
5,This book highlights the inner aspects of feng shui.,"The more I work with feng shui, the more I realize that ""inner"" feng shui cannot be seen apart from ""outer"" feng shui. Many people, however, don't consider inner feng shui in their work or their books; I've seen very few that do. This is one of those that do, and I'm happy to recommend it."
4,Clear introduction to an ancient and powerful science,"Mr Spear writes the way ""how to"" writers should write - and rarely do! I thoroughly enjoyed being educated - not something I often admit. Let it just be said that, after reading this, a lot of changes took place in my home"
1,Nothing New Here.,"This book, like so many others regarding the history of Pearl Harbor, seeks to place the blame for the attack on President Roosevelt. While FDR may have been culpable to some extent as the leader of the nation, this books fails to provide compelling evidence as to why Adm. Kimmel and Gen. Short still should not have been relieved of command. A reliance on unidentified sources makes this a poor history reference."
3,Ouch.,"""Where is Joe Merchant"" is a professional enough work, but one that doesn't have the wild inventiveness and manic spark of Carl Hiaasen's work or the sweet charm of Jimmy's other works. It's clearly an attempt to marry the two worlds, but if such an attempt can succeed (and I imagine someone will do it at some point), this book ain't it.In ""Tales from Margaritaville,"" Jimmy showed that he understood the short story form, infusing his tales with characters and situations that also appear on the album ""Off to See the Lizard."" Lightning doesn't strike twice, though, with this work. The settings and characters seem forced rather than charming, which is a shame, as Jimmy is certainly capable of creating settings and characters to rival the TV shows ""Northern Exposure"" or ""Ed."" This time around, though, Jimmy fails to put such on paper.This is only a book worth reading by the Parrothead completist."
3,"Fast reading, but wanders a lot","For most of the book the pages fly by...except when he takes all these detours about spirituality through one character. It feels contrived and weighs down the adventure quality of the book.With 100 pages taken out, JB could have had one of the best Florida-Keys books ever, but he chose to over-indulge and the book makes some near-fatal clashes with boredom.But, I definitely recommend it to fans of quirky mystery-comedies."
3,Relaxing Read,"No mental energy required - whatsoever. The story has some good humor and moves along at a nice clip. Lots of action with a Gulf Coast philosophy and flavor. Good character development. Yet it's really a frivolous book with some outrageous themes. Would be most appropriate for a weekend at the beach where you just want to look cool to the ladies because you're reading Jimmy's book. Wear your Tommy Bahamma shirt, flip flops, and shades while carrying this colorful title to your lounger to relax."
3,Couldn't hang on to find Merchant!,"I am a die hard Buffett fan so I'll give it 3 stars, but I really couldn't keep reading this one. I will attempt again but the different stories were not coming together for me. I've read better Buffett (A Pirate Looks at Fifty)!!!"
1,Shouldn't have left Margaritaville....,Only the most blindly dedicated Parrothead (and I thought I was one) could truly enjoy this book. I had to work too hard at trying to find an interesting plot amidst the New Age mishmash. Buffett needs to return to the short story format (like the wonderfully entertaining Tales from Margaritaville) or just go back to singing and songwriting.
5,A wonderful read,"I really loved this book. It was action-packed, full of creative plots, delightful twists and turns, and colorful characters... it even has the unforgettable romance! Wish I could read this book for the first time again."
5,Authentic Adolescent Voice!,"Sonnenblick has created a wonderful, zany teenager in Steven Alper, a full equal to Jake Moon, in Park's book, The Graduation of Jake Moon. Steven faces daunting family challenges when his younger brother contracts leukemia, just as Jake deals with his grandfather's descent into Alzheimers. Both protagonists use humor to deal with their families' issues and both reach a resolution which enriches and deepens them, as well as the reader! For a study on health issues, family issues or friendships, teachers and students will find that these authors have the teenage voice down and fine-tuned. Steven will appeal to many middle school students; he's in eighth grade, is a band geek and has good friends. But when he is first faced with his younger brother's illness, his loneliness almost overwhelms him. Thanks to his school counsellor and friends Annette and Renee, he is able to help his family hold together. I give this book two thumbs up, ""one gigantic rush."""
4,Really enjoyed this book!!!!,"I really enjoyed this book, it is a great inspirational book about cancer. A boy's litlle brother falls off a stool and sent to the emerergency room. There the doctors find cancer in him. This book is about a struggle about the family in their grief. I would reccomend this book."
5,Educator Review,"Humorous, poignant story in which playing the drums and dreaming about beautiful Renee Albert occupied most of 13-year-old Steven Alper's thoughts, until his ""pesky"" young brother is diagnosed having leukemia . . . resulting in Steven's discovering his real priorities."
4,An excellent and thought provoking book.,"Mr Griffith has written an outstanding review of WWI battle tactics that helps restore the fighting reputation of the British Empire forces in the Great War. He also restores the balance of view on the German Army, whose reputation in both wars appears to grow with every new publication (in spite of the fact that they were losers on two occasions!). The only reservation I have of the book is Mr. Griffith makes it difficult for you to agree with his conclusions because he sometimes appears to be pushing a strangely reactionary and conservative military barrow. As a citizen of a nation that suffered as much as any in the 1914-18 holocaust, his belief in the offensive sounds all to much like a justification the semi-mystical cult of the offensive that created that unnecessary disaster. But books are meant to stimulate, and Mr Griffith has created a fine work of well researched and highly readable prose that I would recommend to any history buff."
2,Didn't feel anything after I finished reading it,"I know there are some fans out there of Harvey, Joyce, etc. I liked the movies ""American Splendor"" (big fan of Paul G.) and ""Crumb"" and took a chance on this book. I started reading it a while ago but stopped. A month ago I found out I had a pituitary adenoma (a.k.a. benign, slow-growing brain tumor). While going through one of the piles of books on my floor this morning I rediscovered this book and spent the day reading it. I'm pretty much left with a ""So what?"" feeling. One of my best friends from high school had NHL at about the same tme that Harvey did. He's subsequently had several surgeries for brain lesions. Maybe I'm just not the ""American Splendor"" graphic novel type, but I can't recommend this book to anyone, even if they or a loved one has cancer. I thought the illustrations were pretty good in that they well represented the emotions of the characters."
1,lost book...?,The order stated that they shipped my book the next day but I still have yet to receive the book a month later. Unfortunately this is for my math competition preparation in less than a month from now.
2,Incomplete book,This book is far from complete !. it is superficial in all of the issues. You do not have articles in depth. You only have good pics. This book is devoted only to very beginners. Very expensive based on it.
3,OK,The book was not great. It stressed that bonsai is an outdoor activity which I think is false. The book lacked instruction on many topics.
5,Truth Is More Interesting Than Fiction!,"Very moving account of the search for Walter Starr, Jr. The energy and dedication of the searchers (especially Norman Clyde) was truly heroic. Great photos and personal accounts brought the story into clear focus. The Sierras are a wondrous, beautiful place; they are a challenge and even to the experienced climber, can be deadly. This saga brought the ""back country"" home to me again. Although I know I will never enjoy it first-hand again, I can still visit it vicariously through stories such as this. I heartily endorse this book and encourage any lover of the high country to read it. Thank you."
5,Mother Loved It.,"A big Judi Dench fan, my mother received from me for a special occasion. She said she could not put it down. I paid less than $6 new, and now see I got a bargain."
5,"An ""Uncommon Union"" that affected generations for good","Jonathan Edwards was ""difficult"" only because he was so single minded in his calling to be a preacher. Sarah Edwards was ""uncommon"" because to support him in his calling she took over the running of their home, their farm and the raising of their ten happy healthy children. Their union was tender and loving through good times and very bad times (for some years this founder of the first American Revival preached to Indians who didn't even understand him). I highly, highly recommend this book to anyone interested in a well researched, very readable history of Colonial times, Early American faith, or a beautiful and inspiring marriage."
1,Mother of mercy CD,"This cd works on my laptop fine but skips in the cd player in my car & portable cd player in my home.I bought it as a gift ...so was somewhat disappointed when I heard of the issue.Thanks,Louise Sjovold"
4,standard rotors,"they are just fine, no problem, did not over heat, did not cause any braking noise would use them again"
5,I want more!,"I must say, I was thrilled to se this show begin to come out on DVD. I can hardly wait to see more of them, because we all adore the show here, and have half worn this out from watching it.The gag reel is great, and the rest is as funny as I remember it the first time I watched."
3,Not worth the full price,"I've always loved Whose Line (though compared to Clive Anderson in the British version, I feel like it's painful to watch Drew Carey hamming it up for the camera) but this 2-CD set isn't worth $18.99. You get 10 episodes from the first season which, after skimming out the endless explanations of each game, comes down to about two and a half hours of actual footage. Some of the earlier-numbered shows are only chuckle-worthy, which is probably why they're not in numerical order on the discs. Most of the fourth-chair guest comedians aren't even worth watching (with the exception of regulars Greg and Brad).As always, there are a few hilarious bits, like Ryan pretending to be a newborn foal or Wayne's constant musical prowess, but do yourself a favour and wait for the entire season to appear in a bargain bin."
2,15 minutes of uncensored fun,"I was expecting more than the short ""add-on"" of the goofs, flubs, dirty words, etc. It would have been more interesting to see the entire episodes with the censored or bleeped parts still in. I was disappointed that there was so little! The DVD is ok as far as it goes, it just does not go far enough! You get the ""aired"" versions of the episodes and then a ""gag reel"" of the goofs."
3,Good but sTinKy!,"I was excited about giving these to my dogs.First of all, these are VERY LARGE.One trachea could be cut, with a bread knife and sweat, to provide partsfor three dogs.These are rather smelly/stinky and would best be eaten outside.I have ordered more than once, these treats last a while if you portionthem out."
1,Don't waste your money.,Very limited life for these...I found them to be a waste of money. You could do the same thing with one of those blocks with different textured sides for a lot less of an investment.
3,Good drill could be better,"Had one of these ,was a tremendous drill , very strong . That being said , that one spun a transmission within 24 months, for over $200 , that doesn't set well with me. The repair guy thinks he can get Hitachi to ""do"" something for me but it's been months and i need this thing for work, so i will end up buying another only because i already have two batteries and charger, SO hopefully they will improve the quality and they will last a little longer. All in all a good drill though."
4,Gary Morris ' What more needs to be said?,"Great voice,great music, and a great deal. This is a great addition to my collection. I don't like all music but am proud to own and enjoy this cd. Thank you."
3,Great selection of pieces with limited quality,"I'm a huge fan of this series and love Volumes 1, 2 and 3. The selection of tracks included are among my favorites. I have quite a number of opera compilation CDs, but many have chosen performances that I wouldn't consider the best. This 'Best of Opera' series has nailed most of them with superb performances. Unfortunately, some great performances were recorded using technology that doesn't stand up well to today's expectations of sound quality. While the previous three volumes did a good job of selecting not just great performances but also those with superior sound quality, I was disappointed that this volume really failed in the sound quality department. The selections are fine and a good addition to my collection, but I find the quality of the old recordings hard to listen to.If you don't mind the limited quality of old recordings, you'll really appreciate some of these older performances."
3,The Art of Feather Quilting,I received the book very quickly and in good order. The book covers the information about feather quilting very well with good diagrams and examples.
5,The Art of Feather Quilting,Very helpful 'how-to' book to create these beautiful feather designs. An excellent resource book for one's library.
1,Bleck! Invest in the metal spoons.,"I bought these a couple years ago, because I wanted a decent set of measuring spoons, and because the match my measuring cups. I hate them both! They have become horribly stained, and the measurement is placed on with a sticker that has rubbed off of most of the spoons. I have to guess which is which size, and while it's not that difficult, it's inconvenient. The ring that they are on is flimsy, and while it is easy to remove them, it's a pain. They often fall off, and I've stopped using it all together. I do NOT recommend these."
3,"A good book, although slow sometimes","This was my second book of the Harpers Series. A story about a half-elf involved with some assasinations. The main argument is good, the characters are well defined (in fact Danilo character has very good definition) but some of the pieces of the adventure don't fit. For example the battle in the marsh of Chelimber is out of the main adventure, it looks as if the author should have to fill some pages without a clear idea. Fortunately battles are scarce to find (another good point for the novel) and the main adventure has enough consistence for passing some good hours of reading."
3,Good CD but not his best,"Igor is a good saxophonist but I would suggest getting one of his later CDs. The Four Brothers Project is a good choice. He plays jazz with russian folk influence. I would also suggest checking out Lembit Saarsalu (Estonian, tenor sax, jazz with Estonian influence)."
1,not formated for american dvd players,"i cant use it, its not formated for american dvd players, i wish u guys had made it clear that it was for an british country only"
5,It is already in markets,I have just found the complete 9th and 10th seasons in amazon.co.uk. I couldnt understand why amazon.com doesnt have them yet???
5,Friends Season 9,Friends was one of the best shows on TV. I MISS IT -so I bought all of the seasons on DVD and now can watch whenever I need to laugh. They had a good run.
2,the worst season of friends,I have season 1-8 so I'm a big fan but this ninth and final season was awful. No funny jokes boring storylines and very very bad ending. It should have ended with season 8 finale.
2,Cobalt Starfish - Made In China? Huh?,"Beautiful Glass Cobalt Blue Starfish Paperweight 100% Handblown Art P137I have purchased a few other pieces of glass art from this seller, that I am pleased with, so I am regretful to have to be disappointed in the starfish. It doesn't really seem handblown. First, when I turned the starfish over, there was a ""Made in China"" sticker stuck to the bottom. As far as I know, China is not know either for products that are not mass produced or artisan glass blowing. The edges of the starfish's legs are rough, as if they were pulled from a mold and not finished off properly. Finally, the detail and design on the starfish I received is very plain compared to the picture on Amazon. There are no little embellishments or stripes - there's just a shapeless blue blob of glass in the center of the starfish. I'm afraid I'll be returning this piece. It's neither beautiful nor special, and apparently it wasn't even handmade. Bummer!"
3,Good Start,"This is a good start for a series, and Green clearly intends to continue it, since the sub-title is 'BookOne of ""The Seas of Kimoyn"". There are obvious parallels to C.J. Cherryh's 'Foreigner' series, but Green's approach is both new and interesting. Contrary to other reviewers, I found the development of plot and setting quite well done. Green includes an 'Interlude' chapter beginning on page 100 for readers who haven't been sharp enough to figure out the background from the clear and explicit information in the text. I logged on specifically in the hopes of finding the sequel."
1,BAD Deal! Too Much Fine Print,"I didn't read the fine print. After I got the phone,I found out if I wanted to keep my old phone number; I woul have to pay Amazon 250.00. I sent the whole works back. It took a long time to get cancelled before I could get another phone."
3,"Cool shirt, kinda pricey!","Dragonfly is Nikki Sixx line of clothing so it's cool looking and to have the novelty of his name associated with it is great, however the stuff is pricey and considering that the quality isn't the best I've seen."
2,Space bags,"The medium bag could not be sealed properly and I had to keep using the vacuum everyday 'cause the air was getting in. I was not pleased with this at all. Also, the zipper seals keep coming off but I managed to re-insert them. The extra large and large bags were OK."
4,Works Great!,"I am making an international move, so space saving is a high priority. These bags helped me out a lot! I was able to pack 2 large pillows, 1 comforter, 2 sheet sets, and 6 sweaters in an 18 gallon rubbermaid container! Without the space saver bags, only the pillows fit in the container.Downsides:1) They don't lay flat, so be prepared for that.2) The bags were a little smaller than I thought they would be. 2 pillows fit into the XL bag, 1 twin size comforter barely fit into the L bag, and the 6 sweaters barely fit into the M bag.Overall, Im happy with the job they did, but I will be purchasing more due to the small size of the bags. I have a lot more to pack!"
1,Awful,"The zip lock feature doesn't lock properly, the bags develop holes easily in spite of being careful. The zip lock feature is so frustrating; this was one of the worst purchases I've ever made. Don't waste your money."
1,Don't waste your money,"I purchased the ""space saver"" bags and it was a waste of my money. None of the bags held the vacuum seal, they all leaked despite ensuring that the seal was closed, and I followed all of the directions. I use them, but I don't bother to use the vacuum on them, I just store the clothes in them as is. I wouldn't buy these over priced plastic bags ever again."
3,they're okay,"I bought these to save space because I'm moving cross country and need plenty of space in my car. None of my bags ripped, which is good, however they don't stay air tight. Not enough to completely inflate, but they're not as flat as they were when I first vacuum sealed them. I'd say they're okay for temporary storage for traveling, but I don't think they'd be good for long term."
4,Interesting,I Have learned a lot about the Doris Day i didn't knowWell researched and put together very enjoyable
5,"Doris Day - It's Magic by Doris Day, Peter Graves",A great bio for a lady I wish I had met but always enjoyed her voice and on screen.
4,Heartwarming Story - Very Enjoyable Characters,"It was so nice to be able to read a heartwarming story of how true love built over a period of months between Anthony and Daphne. There wasn't the big MISUNDERSTANDING that often ruins a lot of regency romances. Obviously, there were some hurdles but mostly the relationship built up over the course of the book so that you could enjoy the entire book - not just the last couple of chapters.From my perspective, sometimes I just want to have a relaxing, enjoyable read and this most certainly fulfilled my desire to have such an experience. I am so looking forward to reading additional books by this author."
3,"Great beginning, boring ending","What a wonderful set-up for a romance: Daphne, a plain bluestocking has an incredible crush on Anthony, the Duke, who doesn't even know she's alive. After overhearing Anthony's true feelings about her (or lack thereof), Daphne decides to quit working for him and become her own woman. Anthony then tries to convince her to stay, at first because he doesn't want to lose a good worker and then because he doesn't want to let her go. The set-up is wonderful and the first half zips along. The problem is that the book goes about 75 pages too long. It becomes very repetitive - Daphne plays hard to get to Anthony's wooing over and over. The wooing itself is repetitive and... kind of boring. I would have been much happier if there had been a swifter resolution to all of it. Instead, it just made me lose my interest entirely."
4,Nice and portable,Nice portable background support kit. Stability might be an issue but if portability is your first concern then you can overcome the stability issues with weights or caution. Easy and quick to put up. I put it up by myself with very little effort. All rolls up in a nice compact bag for transporting.
4,Click!,...I'll be clicking like a pro...I like the stand...it arrived in the allotted time...condition as promised...
5,Ignis Delights,"If you like Arvo Part, Gorecki, and other minimalists, this is a great album. Like Mozetich, this composer is not well known, but on the basis of this one album I would call him a genius. It is very listenable on first hearing, and gets better with each hearing. It is haunting, and structurally complex. I would rate this among the top 50 albums I own (and I have about 2000)."
4,Easy to use,"This telescope is great for viewing the moon. I've found the controls easy to use and sensitive enough in most cases. The laser sight is mostly useless though.TIP: the entire front plastic cover comes off, not just the obvious smaller view port. This allows in much more light and makes locating objects MUCH easier."
3,Doesn't load,"I bought this game for my 5 year old son - he loves playing it, but he has to start from the beginning every time he plays it! The game will save (I have it on autosave), but when you put it in again and load it, though it states that it is loaded, it will always start from the beginning. My son doesn't even want to play it anymore because all of his hard work is in vain. Oh well I guess."
1,Not high quality,"These are just not high quality bowls; they are not very heavy (maybe compared with a dollar store) but you could easily bend them by hand. But specifically the problem with these bowls are 1) mine were already starting to rust in spots on the inside upon shipment from Amazon 2) there was damage to the top rim which looks like it originated from the factory 3) the plastic lids were terrible smelling, terrible fit and very thin and floppy. There is also only 1 hook in on the side of the bowls.I had purchased this to replace a set of similar size bowls from Ikea that were plastic and only 2.99; well these were not an upgrade by any means. They also did not have anything on the bottom to prevent slipping."
1,Not useable,The tops on these bowls simply do not fit. Do not buy these bowls unless you plan on throwing the lids out.
4,Good but cliche' ridden,"Home Is The Sailor was my introduction to Day Keene. I liked the author's hard-hitting style, but by the end this book winds up being predictable and generic, like a typical 1950s Hollywood crime movie. The too quickly and neatly-wrapped-up happy ending is definitely not in keeping with what I expect from noir and really put me off; plus, the improbable (some might say, ridiculous) mystery behind the femme fatale and murder victim is so badly and blatantly given away by the mid-point that it failed to register any impact at all with me by the time it was finally clinched in the climax... That is, other than to groan, say ""D'OH!"" and smack my forehead, Homer Simpson style. I don't regret the read, it's fast-paced, sexy and exciting enough, but ultimately falls victim to too many cliche's of the genre."
3,Classic pulp.,"Hard Case Crime made a wise decision when it selected Home is the Sailor by Day Keene to be reprinted. This book is a great example of hardboiled pulp fiction written during that particular genre's heyday. Is it great literature? No, it isn't. But it is a fast entertaining read.The narrator/protagonist is Swen Nelson, a stereotypic drunken sailor. Swen, or Swede as he seems to prefer to be called, finds what he thinks is love in the form of Corliss Mason, a young, sharp looking, widowed motel owner. But even through his lovesick, rum besotted haze, he gets the distinct impression he is being used as a patsy.Home is the Sailor is, at its essence, a crime story with plenty of hardboiled action and terse, no nonsense dialogue. The plotting is a bit haphazard and the characters are poorly fleshed out. Still, for aficionados of hardboiled crime, Home is the Sailor qualifies as a worthwhile, fun read."
3,Too short for the dollar,This DVD content was ok but not as good as others I have watched. It was very short for the money you spent but it does have some good ghost hunting segments.
3,Too little space for too many topics,"What an odd little book. I'd rather have had him dwell more on towers and stories about towers, which fascinated me. I got bored with all his inner stuff, maybe if it hadn't been so scattershot, if he hadn't tried to cover so much in so little space. Let's see... there was the purchase of the land and the construction of the tower, tidbits about other towers in place and time, his struggle with faith/religion, his struggle with vertigo, his struggle with a plethora of people he knew fighting cancer, and his relationship with his daughter and to a lesser degree, his wife. Whew! All that in 200 small pages with wide margins."
5,I'm 29 again,"Lotta Lovin was awesome then and is now. To bad for Gene that he sounded so much like the King. It is notable, though, that this is one hit that Elvis did not try to snag. There should have been room for them both. The seller was great as was Amazon (as they always are}"
5,Good for self quizzing,This is a straightforward book. Lots of quizzes and questions for easy self testing.
5,Classic!,I love the the Poirot stories and have enjoyed watching them on t.v. I can't believe how good this looks on DVD. I plan to order the rest of the series.
2,Marc's take on the New Jack Swing movement ???,"Warning This disc is for a fan only. If you like Marc Nelsons voice and singing ability you should get this. Myself being a fan of the man I enjoyed it all right but this Cd came out sounding like a poorly excecuted rip off of BBD by a fake Teddy Riley imitator on production at a time when that sound was being ran into the ground. Poor Marc was probaly at the mercy of unhip white music execs at Capitol Records trying to use a proven sound instead of letting my boy come into his own as an artist. Marc sould have stayed with Boyz II Men where he would have easily been the break out star of the group and parlayed the recognition into a successful solo career. The only songs on this CD that are remotely original are""I Want You"" , ""Cross My Heart"" and ""Summer Love"". If you want to here a solid effort from Marc Nelson I'll suggest his 1999 disc ""Chocolate Mood"". ""CM"" is more of Marc as an artist an less on the current trends."
3,not properly shipped?,"product good, too bad the plastic case had 2 cracks in it. Bought for my granddaughter, she didn't notice, but i did."
2,"I was waiting for this book, but-","I was wanting to see how the Liaden universe had began, but I really didn't get many answers from this book.The plotting is not up to the authors usual pace, and the characters are wooden. I really wanted to like this book, but I couldn't. I will skip the sequel, and wait for the authors to come back to their liaden roots."
3,Good but having subtitle would be better.,"I appreciate this high quality poetry DVD of Robert Frost. The readings by the First Poetry Quartet and the Fall scenery of New England are great.But for a non-native English speaker like myself, it would be better if the DVD can have a sub-title function to print out the words of the poems on screen if one chooses to use this function so one can follow the poems more readily. Also, it would be great if the DVD would have the title of the poems on screen rather than just listing them on the DVD cover. I hope the production company of these series can take my suggestion into consideration in making future products in this good poetry series."
4,For everyone who has an urge to visit the ATM at a casino.,Very well written book that moves along nicely. We can all see ourselves or our friends depicted in these pages. The denial and progression of the disease of gambling is very well done and in a believeable manner. A good read
1,Bad!,"I don't like this. I bought it at the store with christmas money! waste. it said stained glass but it was wax paper, and it didn't even come with the wax paper! yucky crafts thing!"
4,DOG MUZZLE,I LIKE THIS PRODUCT IS USEFUL AND CAME TIMELY AND THE PRICE WAS GOOD. I RECOMMEND THIS SEELLER AND THIS PRODUCT.
3,BEAUTIFULLY WRITTEN,"Where Brutal was gritty, street, and raw, Boundaries is polished, stylish, and very slick."
1,not as good as the old ones,These shoes do not have the moving air pocket that the old classic DMX has. I would not reccomend them
4,Scared me to death as a child.,"Return to Oz is a film I watched when I was a child and even this fantasy gave me the willies, but I couldn't help but enjoy this bizarre child-like adventure. So much darker than the Wizard of Oz starring Judy Garland, Return to Oz stars Fairuza Balk who in some ways is more connivincing as Dorothy Gale. The good and evil characters are pretty scary, so probably this film should not be viewed by children under the age of 8. There is this one scene that still sticks out for me, where all the mannequin heads come to life, creepy as can be!!! Gotta give this '80s classic a viewing, it will trip you out, enjoy!"
2,As if you can really attempt a sequal to a classic,"When young Dorothy starts having trouble sleeping and raving about how she knows her friends in oz are in trouble, Aunt Em takes her to a hospital for shock therapy.Anyway, fast forward to Oz. The yellow brick road is crumbled, the Emerald city has been turned to stone and Oz has a modern day Wicked Witch (sort of).The characters were nothing like the originals, Dorothy seemed to grow younger, and chickens can talk. Some good new characters, like Tick Tock the wind up loyal soldier and Jack, the scarecrow with a pumpkin for a head. But overall, not that terribly great IMO."
5,one of my favorite Fantasies.,"this goes on my top fantasies with Dark Crystal, The Hobbit, Howard the Duck, The Last Unicorn, Labyrinth, Wizard of Oz, Neverending Story, City of Lost Children, Big Trouble in little China, Terry Gilliam's Brazil, Stargate, Legend, Who framed Roger Rabbit, Black Cauldron, and Conan. for anyone who is a fan of these Movies should check this one out, it's very entertaining and fun as well. it maybe too scary for little Children but enjoy."
5,Just as I remember it,"Very different from first OZ. However, if you have read the books, the director does a great job of sticking to the artistry. However, not as young child friendly (lady taking off heads and replacing them is a bit much for the young'uns)"
4,My daughter's favorite OZ movie!,My daughter loves this movie as it more closely follows the book. She was even surprised that the special effects turned out as well as they did. The Rock King was neat.
5,One of the Best Disney Movies!,"I thank Roy Disney,Will Vinton and George Lucas for Creating This Spooky But Fantastic Film I Like Since ""Star Wars"" and ""Roger Rabbit""! Princess Mombi and the Gnome King are Perfect Disney Villains! Dorthey Hugging Tic-Toc is So HeartWarming to Mothers and their Childrens! and I Love Happy Endings! the Special Effects Is So Cool! Thank You!"
2,"Book is Fine for Young, Aggressive Corporate Types","This book might be recommended to young, aggressive high-earning corporate types, who perhaps are able to save extremely aggressively from about around age 25 until 45, and then suddenly retire and become hippies.However, it's definitely not for a regular person who earns an average income throughout their working career, and who is lucky to have saved enough for retirement at age 65."
1,Not happy.,"I ordered two of these medicine cabinets. Both arrived damaged. Both had bent frames and one had a chip out of the mirror. My husband has called Zenith twice. They keep telling us to take it up with Amazon and return it to Amazon. Problem is, we don't have an address nor a telephone number for Amazon. The shipping label was from Zenith. We're not sure what to do as we have two damaged products which we can't use, and the seller/shipper won't take responsibility. Hope someone can help us. We have never had a problems with any product we bought through Amazon until now."
2,Expensive,Thought we were getting something more substancial. Could have gotten the same from a big box store for 1/3 the price.
1,terrible,Everyone it seems agrees the egg crate has NOOO thickness for support and IS NOT AS ADVERTISED!It is NOT three inches. Half that is a big stretch.Husband desperately needed support and now has none yet again. this is terrible.
5,College text material,"This book is required at Northern Illinois University for a course in elemental astronomy. It comes with a handy cd-rom helpful for finding stars, planets, etc. Did you know that there is a measurement that is more helpful than light years? It is parsec. Read the book to see how to understand this measurement. Also, guess how many grains of suger are there in a quart jar. The answer is at the bottom of this page. Give up? If that and other mind blowing things interest you then read this book. There are ten billion stars in our galaxy, called the Milky Way, and there are billions of galaxies. (there are about a half billion grains)."
5,Great Camera,"The best thing about the VLAH 60U is that you don't have to worry: the lighting doesn't matter, the acoustics don't matter, the person shooting the scene doesn't matter. It always seems to come out great.We had a christening, and my mother in law came from Lithuania to be part of it. She speaks virtually no English, and my Lithuanian could be called pathetic. I gave her the camera, and with a few gestures and a minimum of words, she was able to get some great shots, despite the fact that the church was dark and the PA system sucked....That is good in a family camera.The only problem is that ..., and it has no remote or in camera charger. Those two things are very desirable and would make it even better. I'm hoping to find both someday."
5,Your best bet is this album by Pet!,"Great combination of previously released Pye (UK) and Warner Bros. albums that hold well up into the Millennium - contains a bevy of ear candy that will have you coming back to this fine disc again and again for repeated helpings of some fine 1960s songs done as only the inimitable Petula Clark can do. This is a CD to take in the car and sing along with; it's great fun to hear these memorable songs again and again. Includes a ballad rendering of the McCartney/Lennon monster hit ""I Want To Hold Your Hand,"" as well as an well arranged and orchestrated cover (most of the songs here are covers, incidentally with the exception of the obvious hits)of the Honeycombs' ""Have I The Right?"" Three great bonus tracks are included, the best being ""High,"" that was the ""B"" side of the U.S. Warner Bros. single, culled from the movie ""The Cool Ones."" These two albums plus the bonus cuts are a bargain at any price and offer over 75 minutes of music. Five stars to this one!"
2,I accidentally read this book twice...,"because I forgot that I already read it. This copy was printed in 2000 so I had to have read it within the last 4 years, but I couldn't remember a thing. I got half way through it the second time before I came across something that I recognized. The memorable piece for me was such a minor plot point, I finished the book again anyway because I still couldn't remember how it ended. It was okay while I was reading it (good enough to read twice), but it obviously didn't stick to my ribs the first time."
1,Watch out!!!!!,"Hey, Hey, Hey!! A greatest hits collection!!! As Waylon once so perfectly put it, ""WRONG!""There are two actual hit songs here in their original versions, ""On Second Thought, and Runnin' With The Wind."" There is one more song that is an orginal, ""Lonely Out Tonight."" The rest are all remakes of his biggest songs.Nothing makes me angrier than stuff like this. Before you buy this, you just assume they are the big hits in their original form.You can find ""On Second Thought,and Runnin' With the Wind"" on their original cd's, so just let this one die quietly."
3,The Night Of the Headless Horseman,"VERY interesting animation. Great for 7-10 year-olds. A bit slow, but when it gets ""scary"", it grabs your attention!"
4,book review,"Within and beyond the Writing Process by Reade Dornan, Lois Rosen, and Marilyn Wilson is an excellent find for secondary English teachers. Writing Process gives a reason to write, asking and answering the simple question of, ""Why writing?"" ""Writing is thinking,"" ""Writing is a language process,"" ""We learn to write by writing,"" and many more answers are given to tne question. One of the ways the book invites you to interact is with the Think/Write blocks. These blocks have you stop reading and write. The writing can be about personal thoughts, opinion about the prior passage, or many other interesting subjects. This book touches on the writing process, writing workshops, grammar, research papers, and much more. This book would be great for the English teacher having a hard time getting her class to love writing. The writing blocks can be used in the classroom as journal entries or essays. The secondary English teacher should scoop this book up to begin exciting their class."

3,good...,"the album was good. yeah, it couldve been way better... theyr no exploding hearts... but they're ok. the vocals have a great i dont care quality and the beats and rythms are pretty good. the lyrics shed a quality light on the way teens from portland feel about the world around us. besides,ted the lead singer is awsome."
4,"Nice, affordable edition","It is very useful to have a Kant's shorter essays on political philosophy and the philosophy of history collected in a single volume. While a larger, more comprehensive collection, edited by Hans Reiss, is published by Cambridge Univ. Press under the title *Kant: Political Writings*, this smaller Hackett version is nicely translated and much more affordable. Hackett Publ. Co. in general has been very kind to philosophy. They deserve your patronage."
5,A serious side of W. C. Fields,"Just a quick note... W.C Fields was a huge Dicken's fan, if you will. Due to that respect of his work, this is the ONLY film that W.C. Fields did that he never once ad libbed, he played it straight."
2,Think hard before buying,"It lacks small but important features like S-video output, which you expect in this age. Surprisingly , even the accessories are not able to make up."
3,They sell a lot of these in Kalamazoo,"C'mon, one review per buyer, you aren't fooling anyone.Actually, I'd take you more seriously with the first review than I do now that I see you playing games..."
5,Great Nature Movie,"This is a beautiful movie about the wondrous North and its wolf inhabitants. It is also a movie with moments of absolute hilarity. The ending is, of course, poignant and sad; as nature movies often are. But it is well worth watching! One of my favorites."
4,Don't let the Bear sway your opinion or decision,"I LOVED ""Never Cry Wolf""!!! I saw it years ago on video, but can only imagine the DVD is as good or better. I was disappointed to see that it was listed with 'The Bear' to buy together.... I love Anthony Hopkins, and the Bear was one of the worst movies I have EVER seen. Don't let the pairing with 'The Bear' scare you off. ""Never Cry Wolf"" is excellent!Sorry Tony :-) Okay, I just realized that 'The Edge' was the one with Anthony Hopkins... my apologies to the Bear! Anyway, get ""Never Cry Wolf""! You won't be disappointed!!!"
3,"Okay, but","I won't bother re iterating the story since so many others have, but I will warn others about what I wished I'd been warned about. This man is shown for quite a long time nude. It isn't done in a sexual sense, but all the same, those of you who planned on this being a family viewing movie (as we did) may want to have this knowledge ahead of time so you can think about whether you want your children in the area or not.Watch for two areas: One; after the man falls through ice, the next scene will show nude buttocks close up. Two; much later in the movie - after the man goes swimming nude, and is sunning himself there will be a long time scene of caribou running in which he is nude the entire scene, since he was caught that way."
3,Never Cry Wolf,"After having seen this movie on another DVD, I was disappointed in this version, as I believe some scenes were omitted. Maybe they were too graphic for viewing by younger children, e.g. the scenes of eating mice, etc. I will view it again and maybe I will rate it higher."
2,story line BORING,"The sex is hot the book is not. When writing on part fantasy part real life - - use a better story line, going to the moon and faraway galaxy's was ridiculous and made the story boring. I want to know when I fantasize that it could have happened even if only in my mind!"
1,poor quality,My son got this as a gift. I can't wipe the dry eraser marker off the white board and the chalk doesn't write well on the chalk board.I wiped the white board very hard with the damp cloth to try to get the eraseable marker off and I failed.
4,Spell-binding,"Carol Bennett tells a spell-binding tale that captivated me from the moment I opened Jennie's Reprisal. It usually takes me months to find time to finish a book, and I couldn't put this one down. Bennett skillfully opens readers to the possibilities that the mystical world holds while crafting a page-turning story. I felt like I knew the characters personally by the time I finished."
2,Not what I had hoped it would be,"We love Laurie Berkner and her songs, but her story was just so so. It's simply the lyris to her song, Victor Vito with pictures. There is no extra story line, and it doesn't read smoothly. My daughter (5 years old) is a big fan of the Noggin music videos and Laurie's CDs, but the book bored her."
4,I wanted more!,"When I started reading this book, I thought I wouldn't like it, but I wanted to read all three of the books about the Black Wolf's family. So, I read it and I loved it! And I couldn't wait to pick of the next book about Brenna, Robin and his lady love! Great book!"
5,In the Shadow Midnight,I am a history buff and Marsha Canham writes a believable story that could have easily have been fact. She builds the suspense with excellent interaction between the characters.
5,Perfect for language learners,"I am an elementary Spanish and ESL teacher. This book is always a hit with my ESL students who come to see me! They beg me to visit their classroom and read it to the group. It's like their ""show and tell"". The repetition is great but the subject matter is irresistible, no matter how many times they've heard it. And, yes, I do make someone eat some peas and no, no one really throws up and yes, I do take along a few plastic, but-oh-so-real-looking worms or other creepy critter."
3,pretty Good set,"I was mainly listening to this Album for Andre Ward's take on R.kelly's step in the Name of love""&He does a Good Job.I tend to like more Mid-Tempo&Up tempo cuts&this cool for this set."
1,Poor product,"I received this item fast. However, I installed it with ease, but it is way too loose and the handle still slides out the ""handle-keeper"" I still have to resort to either taping or using zip ties to secure it to the jack.Poor product from Hi-Lift themselves...."
3,E-Z Duz It...,"This is a great resource if you write standard letters regarding inquiry, payments or requests. It is best for administrative staff, accountants and small business owners that deal with vendors, accounts, etc. For administrative purposes, you can't go wrong with this software. The most efficient it has been for me to this point is requesting leave. Who wants to think about how to word a request for leave? With Business Letters Made E-Z, you don't have to."
2,Color not as pictured,"I was very disappointed when I received this vase and it was not the 'beautiful' red, black, and yellow mix of colors pictured on the site. Instead it is predominantly dark purple and mauve with hints of yellow and green. While it is a stunning piece, it doesn't match my decor. Quite a shame. I understand that each piece is unique, but I feel it is irresponsible to misrepresent its color."
2,Pricing isn't so good,"First off I bought this two years ago art Kmart for'm only 20 dollars. Sadly Kmart discontinued them so Amazon is about your only option. The tracks fell of (I was 12) but not even my dad could put them back on for my Lee tank. . the main turret fell off after falling on the wood floor ,but that was a poor job by me. It's a 3 star item because of the price is WAY TOO MUCH."
4,Good,"It was weird tuning because the strings right as u tune one get out of tune, but it can be done!! Really good violin:) good for starter"
5,FORMULA ONE PACK For the Diehard F1 Fan,"The CD has fantastic sounds-- BRM car brings back fond memories. The Pop Ups especially the Ferrari instrument panel and the F1 with pit crew is great. All graphics, photographs are 5 star quality. This is a must book for the F1 fanatic."
3,replacements,Used to have a set of these. I wore them out I like them so much. Then I ordered these replacements--it said 5 left. Now Amazon is telling me they can't ship them because they don't have them. I am really sad. They were really hot in my Neon and everyone loved them. I hope I get them soon--even if they do fade to purple in the sun and tear at the seat seam...
2,way too smaller than I expect,"I was fooled by the term 'case'. These bags are smaller than whatever carried on suitace I've known or use!To be fair, let me tell that it works pretty well. It does the job anyway."
4,An extremely helpful how-to guide,"I bought this book and three hours after opening it, I had a will written and ready to be witnessed. Denis Clifford has written an excellent resource for those of us with simple needs in ensuring our assets will go to the right individuals when we die. Extremely common-sense advice, a reassuring style, and a quick read! Great advice for the unmarried (like me), the married with or without children, and the single parent."
2,Faulty premise leads to faulty conclusions,"This is quite likely the worst book HRED has written. That said, there is still much of value. To find it though, one must wade through the author's agenda- she was in her One Great Goddess phase- and incomplete as well as unconnected examples of, well, sometimes one can't be quite sure just what she is trying to say or prove.If your starting point is the premise that there was One Great Goddess, fine, you will love this book. If you want a scholarly evalution of Germanic goddesses, you will need to go elsewhere."
3,Lego fun,This Lego Table has been alot of fun. The children are immediately attracted to it when they enter the room. The bin for legos makes it easy to clean up and keep organized. My only complaint is that the bolts won't stay in the chairs. It is a monthly repair issue and the set is only 6 months old.
3,replacement or refund,"It is a 3 cd set. Well, cd # 3 does not play at all. I get a constant disc error message. PLEASE ADVISE ON REFUND OR REPLACEMENT FOR CD # 3 I`ll be waiting for a reply. I received NO paperwork as to refund or repacement. doug.miracco@aol.com"
4,The Capitol years,"I am one of those who was around in the 'fifties when all of these albums were created and I bought a number of them at the time and I have still Come Fly With Me on Mono and it is just as good as being reprocessed.I do agree with the contributor who said that instead of getting a collection, that you should get each of the albums individually. None of them are expensive and in real terms are far cheaper than in the days when they originally came out.Believe it or not, 60p - 80p seemed a lot then to buy an album and always took a little bit of thought before one bought. These days they can be picked or downloaded for 3.00 to 4.00 which is a doddle and what a joy to be able to afford so easily these forever classics"
4,"No Disney, No McDonald's ? Please!","Cannella does an apt job of dispelling myths of Disney, McDonald's and the influence or ""American culture"" in education. If you love big corporations, coporate greed, and monopolies this is not the read for you. This book reads like a documentary movie. So.. if you enjoy documentaries like SuperSize Me, Bowling for Columbine, I'm sure you'll find yourself enjoying and frustrated at the same time by what Cannell writes.If you don't much like documentaries this book still has something for everyone. Cannella's writings provide a perspective on what ""American culture"" is, how it came to be and how we endoctrinate it into our schools- worldwide."
2,Dollar Store Stuff,"Each and every track here has been release and re-released a hundred times. All of these songs are dated and up to 55 years old (J Cash-I Walk The Line-1956). The artwork is absolute minimal with zero artists, chart or song information.The sound is fine and the selections are indeed classic but this same selection with the same songs has been offered many, many times before.Save your money.."
4,Fun Colors!,"Love this curtain. Ordering it for the second time though due to mildew, but other than that it's durable and colors are great."
4,Need them to make the Varizoom remote control heads Work...They don't tell you that when you buy one!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,You Need them to make the Varizoom remote control heads Work...They don't tell you that when you buy one !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
3,Disappointed,Fitted sheet is skimpy and barely fits my queen-size mattress. Also the top sheet is shorter than my other sheets and therefore doesn't stay tucked.
1,Very poor product,Thought this sounded too good to be true and it is. Bottom fitted Queen fits under mattress but not over top of mattress. Top sheet is much too short. To say we are disappointed is an understatement. We've used the sheets so we won't send them back but this product is made in China and should remain there.
4,All great but they wont stay on my bed,"These sheets were a great deal and were a welcome replacement for one of the sets of sheets I use. The 1000 thread count got me interested and are what sold the product to me. These sheets are soft! The Sateen in the sheets is a minor problem. The sheets start slipping off the bed after a night or two of sleeping under them. So I end up stripping and re-making the bed about 3 times a week. Other than that, these sheets are very satisfactory and were well worth the $40 I paid."
2,1000 Thread Count Sheet Set,Beautiful color - lilac. Top sheet is very small. It will barely tuck into the bottom of the mattress and is also short on the sides. Pillow cases are also rather small for king size. Other sheet sets I have bought with high thread count have been softer. This set was rather stiff even after several washings.
4,Very nice sheets,"Great product for an amazing price. Theses sheets are very nice, soft and look great."
2,Bad Elastic,Very nice fabric...weak elastic. One corner of elastic broke the first time we put the sheets on the mattress :(
2,better as a tablecloth,"If, unlike me, you're into thick heavy sheets that could double as a tablecloth or a mainsail, these these sheets are for you. These sheets are a bargain, if you think value is primarly determined by the price per pound. I have much more comfortable 600TC sheets, with better hand, texture, sheen and color fastness than these. Although I haven't put these under the microscope, I suspect what they're made of is multi-ply (i.e. twisted) thread, which tends to over-state the actual threadcount for softness compared to a sheets where each thread consists of a single ply. If these sheets were any worse, I would have returned them, but they rate a grudging OK at the price...but buyer beware."
5,"Good sheets, flat sheet is a little bit short","These sheets are beautiful, luxurious, thick silky, heavy weight, and smooth after a wash. It fits my 18"" mattress with topper but a little bit tight in width. The flat sheet is a little short in length compare to other brand. Paid $72 for this set."
1,This is NOT Greg Ginn,Be warned. This is NOT the band GONE with Greg Ginn! When you type in GONE on the AMAZON search page this does come up with Greg Ginn's band GONE but it is NOT Greg Ginn. I bought it based on the AMAZON LINK and was sorely disappointed!
2,Needs Time,"The game hasn't changed much after beta.o Not much content.o Several players now boast level 100 just after 1 month of play.o Server events pose lag issues worse than earlier games.o Regardless of hardware, frame rates are below par.o ""Skater"" and ""standing grey corpses"" as other players approach.o Dragon race is unfinished.o Observe several classes solo higher level mobso Lack of item decay keeps craftable items in low demando Quests are not very involved and lack creativity.For a list of pros/cons and all the chatter, check out http://www.tazoon.com or http://horizonsvault.ign.com. Post your question or read the commentary posted by the current subscribed player-base."
2,game with potential but vastly unfinished,"After playing this game for 6+months I cant recommend it to anyone. The graphics are nice for a little bit but have issues with ATI cards, sounds is average and the gameplay while promising is missing a terrible amount of content. The weekly events are now monthly and uninspired, very few monsters and a lot on incomplete classes/features with no ETA on introduction.The company has downsized due to financial issues and thus bug fixes and feature introduction that was tauted as in game on release are still not in with no time frame.The economy is player based totally, but is out of whack, where crafters prefer to sell to npc's than players and being an adventurer serves the only purpose to fork money over to the crafters for items you cannot get anyway/anywhere else.So much is broken in there currently it's not funny. Even dragons the major selling point are far from completed."
1,EQ re-hash with no dungeons or content,"I'm in the beta test, don't be fooled by any hype. This game has NO original concepts, you can fight boring computer monsters only, and there are no dungeons only the same boring landscape everywhere, hell your character can't even swim! Combat is so simplistic you can get up and go get a snack and it has no effect on the outcome, your auto-attack is just as good as any other power. ALL RACES & CLASSES ARE THE SAME, they are no different except in appearance. Your level 20 fighter will be the same as every other level 20 fighter, ALWAYS! Save your money!"
1,Buyer Beware,"I have not bought this collection but just want to send a heads up because whilst reading reviews of a Marlon Brando film (One Eyed Jacks) many people wrote of the poor picture quality of DVD's from ""Madacy Home Video"" which this Streisand collection is from. So make sure you can return it if the DVD transfer is poor quality. If anyone who buys it would post a review from a technical point of view, not reviewing the films themselves, that would be helpful in deciding whether or not to purchase. Better product description would also be welcome, such as does it have any bonus material?"
1,Payroll Made E-Z,"Payroll Made E-Z's name is misleading. The user must go to alternative sources for definitions of acromyms appearing in the application. The help files are inadequate and no tutorials exist. A ""desktop"" menu would be helpful, as would the ability to delete data files within the application. The application seems to have a mind of its own, as when it adds Earned Income Credit (EIC) data when none was entered/is required. Employee pay data appear on the individual timecards but fail to show up on the summary report. It may be payroll software, but it is not E-Z."
4,hard to find,she has a sweet dark voice. the album sounds very personal and i am surprized she has dissappeared with such a beautiful voice. worth finding and checking out.
2,Little White Elvis,"This recording unfortunately highlights Elvis' limitations as a singer. Allen toussaint is a tough act to keep up with, and although Costello tries hard, he just ends up sounding lame, and significantly detracts from the songs' appeal. This would have been a far better effort if Elvis had stuck to writing and playing and left the vocals to someone else."
3,It's more about INXS as a band than about Hutch as a person.,"Of course, it was interesting for me as for an INXS fan but truthfully I expected something more. I have to admit, I was looking for more about his family, friends, his personal intrests, about his childhood. I also wanted a whole, complex interview of Hutch. Instead I got a huge one of Kirk. Anyway if you want to know about Hutch as a member of INXS- this is for you. But if you're looking for Hutch as ""just a man"" you'll be disappointed."
1,This book is awful,This book is awful. As an MBA student I thought it would be a good complement to my classes. I was painfully mistaken. This book covers only the most basic valuation models and not even all of them. No mention of APV or Abnormal Earnings models. I strongly discourage anyone who has had even limited exposure to company valuation from buying this book - you will waste your money.
4,yummm,THese are very good and seem very healthy. THe only thing is you better like super crunchy because these are kind of messy because they are so very crunchy (thick crunchy to boot). BUt they have great flavor and go great with spreads and cheeses.
5,An Over-Looked Christmas Gem,I had never seen The Captain and Tennille when they were on in the 76-77 television season which was my loss. I got the Ultimate collection which was terrific so I bought the Christmas special which was colorful and lots of fun. It is hard to imagine such Talent going into a show these days in 2007! If you like fun and talented entertainers I highly recommend this DVD.
1,Captain & Tennille Christmas Show,"After reading glowing reviews on this CD and being a Toni Tennille fan I decided to purchase it. I watched it yesterday and what a disappointment! It's lame, lame, lame ! Andy Williams is much better."
2,Watering Can Broke on First Day of Use,"The other pieces of this set are okay, but the lid of the watering can snapped off the first day my son used it. The seller provided a full refund, but it is still a flimsy product."
3,"Cute, but not the best quality","We have had these for a few weeks now. My 2-year old and 1-year old have been playing with them in their kiddie pool, but have not played with them in the sand yet. The watering can did not last long before the red handle and yellow cap came off. They do not screw on. They are only glued on. I used strong super glue to glue them back on, but they came off again, because there isn't much surface area for them to adhere to each other. The other pieces have held up fine so far, but it has only been a few weeks, so I'm not sure they will hold up by the end of summer."
2,won't last long,"we've only had this beach set for about 3 months or so and the bucket already has a crack in it, the shovel is falling apart, and the water container spout top already fell off (i think the glue came undone). our son has used this at the beach a few times, but i expected the beach set to last longer. the toys in the beach set are also not very interesting. product is very cheaply made."
2,"Bad book, go to your room.","I enjoyed the Eyewitness Travel Guide for Istanbul, although I used the Blue Guide to fill in the many information gaps. However, where the ETG finds success when providing information for a city, it fails when trying to cover an entire country.This book was almost completely uselss. The Oslo section only covers with any detail the immediate downtown section. The maps for greater Oslo are horrible. The tram and bus information is wrong.Of couse my largest gripe is my own fault. I knew one skinny book would leave way to much out.One area the book got right, an area that every single other ETG has gotten wrong, was the food area. Handing the book around to Norwegians on the train brought more than a few, ""Yes, that is what I normally eat."""
1,Don't buy just place in trash and walk away,I performed several self repairs since I'm a certified tech. What a waste of parts. The display died again. This time the cold cathode element went out. And it can't be replaced. To dig down to the element requires the destruction of the display. I had been using this unit for several years connected to the docking station. Also had it on a cooling base on a desk top system. I finally decided to see about the image dropping out and don't bother. This should be labeled as disposable only.
2,Not for impatient beginners,I could not learn to speak any danish from this book.Buy Pimsleur's and Berlitz's instead!
4,Brings back a lot of memories. It's heartwarming music.,"Listening to this music brings a lot of warm memories back, my mother and grandmother young and beautiful, listening, singing. Yes, it doesn't have the sharpness of new recordings, but Libertad Lamarque's voice is clear and melodious, the feelings and the passion come through and the nostalgic and sentimental music touches within."
5,Drexler keeps on track!,"No big words in his lyrics. His arte-poetica grows in theYupanqui-style: the greatness of the small things, talking bythemselves.All what Drexler says becomes beautyfull, just because it issimply true and coming from a human, transparently and completelyopen tu us.Combined with that, are the fine sensitivity in the melodiesthat he creates, his arrangements and an evidently ""totalaesthetical control"" of the product that he presents.Try ""Memoria del cuero"", and if you'r not spanish-speaking,ask some friend to translate it for you while listening. Thistune, together with ""De Amor y Casualidad"" in his former album""Llueve"" puts definitly Drexler's name in the first line ofthe uruguayan musical concept.Only a genuine uruguayan, could write-down, compose, arrangeand compute together all this materials. And JD is still doingit for us. Cheers!"
3,Charming but outdated,"Marie-Antoinette's glittering, yet tragic life has always captured the imagination. Oddly enough, few movies give it full justice, and this ""Marie-Antoinette"", released in 1938, perhaps even less than others.For one thing, this film is full of historical inaccuracies - not to mention the heavy clichés - to the point of making you wonder if the producers ever thought of consulting an Historian!Norma Shearer is a very charming Marie-Antoinette but in a Gilbert and Sullivan type of way. At no time was I able to take her seriously in that role.As for Louis XVI, played by Robert Morley, he was once again poorly treated by the production. He may have been sexually inhibited, pathologically adverse to making decisions (which proved to be his downfall) but he was certainly not the indolent idiot portrayed in this movie.Charming as it may be, this film should be viewed for what it is: a light operetta without much substance.Marie-Antoinette's life deserves better!"
4,A Splendid Reminder of a Studio That Was!!,"A nostalgic movie of the 1930s, produced by the splendid M.G.M. Studios,sadly now defunct! Its the type of film that can be viewed comfortably over and over again, the puzzle is why such a big production with high budget income never went one more step and gave it Technicolor? Recommended for sure"
2,Rigoletto,"Je n'ai pas reu le bon disque j'ai reu plutt Rico Saccani, Verdi : Rigoletto. Quand j'aurai le bon disque celui que j'ai commmandé?"
3,Live (and long),"Well of course it's long, what does one expect from a live album? It includes some of Paul's best from the Beatles and Wings as well as some of his own. There are some songs that really shouldn't be on here, but who am I to judge Paul's work? It is a worthwhile buy, but if you are into the Beatles or Paul McCartney, you've heard it all before. There are cheaper live CDs that are more worthwhile."
4,"7 tracks here are Paul's best 'live' versions of the song, still","If you are creating a LIVE set for a post-1960s Beatles collection, you'll find six worthy cuts here that aren't bettered elsewhere: Got to Get You into My Life, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, Sgt. Pepper's Reprise, Hey Jude, Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End and Yesterday. Also: Twenty-Flight Rock would go nicely onto a Covers set. If you don't go for Paul's `conducting' the crowd during Hey Jude's coda, as I don't, it's easily deleted with rudimentary music editing software without missing a beat. You might also want to separate Sgt. Pepper and its reprise.Thank-you Paul for recording so many `live' albums that we can cherry-pick the lot."
3,Paul's anthology - live,"Had Paul's voice been in finer form (it is extremely hoarse in some areas), this might have been one of the best live albums ever. I mean, you got everything from ""Hey Jude"" to ""Band On The Run"" on here, live! But Paul totally butchers songs like ""Maybe I'm Amazed"" with his totally hoarse voice. He sounds like Rod Stewart with a cold! Still, there are some fine moments on here like ""Things We've Said Today"" and ""Live And Let Die"". And the Abbey Road medley at the end is nice, but not quite as good as he performed it at the Concert For Monserrat."
4,It's a pretty good game !,I would say this game is pretty good. It has a lot of different layouts. The only thing I didn't like is that it isn't consecutive - like when you finish one layout it doesn't go to a next one or anything like that. Most of them are pretty easy. I love puzzle games though and MahJongg ROCKS!
2,"great idea, but...","this watch (or computer) is the greatest thing ever. until, ...it crashes just like a computer. resets and doesn't keep time for longer than 2-3 days. i'm still trying to track through the warranty process, but they don't make it easy on you. especially since i recieved it as a gift and don't know who the retailer is. if, in fact, i get through the warrenty process with a good story i will post it here. but at the moment i am quite frustrated wearing a watch that doesn't keep time."
4,they came through,"once i found the information for suunto usa (not easy to do), they were very helpful. they replaced the watch in about 2 weeks. now i'm very happy."
2,If I wanted to just sit and watch someone play bass I would have gone to a jazz club,"If I wanted to just sit and watch someone play bass I would have gone to a jazz club, and I think that would have been more educational. I ended up just having to go out and buy another DVD."
1,una decepcion,"Esta libreta que cabe en la palma de la mano esta llena de ideas tan originales como estas: ""cuando lo saque a pasear, detengase para que observe las flores, un pero, un arbol, etc.""...""hagale gestos y muecas para que el trate de imitar""...""leale un cuento y muestrele figuras grandes y sencillas""...""pongalo a que se mire al espejo"". Cual madre ya no hace todo eso sin instruccion? No pierda su dinero en esto."
2,"No tab, Tom Kolb assumes you know the whole song","Much like the Acoustic version on this series, the producers and instructors don't include tablature to help the guitarist follow the lesson. Moreover the entire songs are not played in full. You hear only pieces and riffs. This is probably a function of licensing and costs, but it leaves the product deficient as a learning tool. It's like learning multiplication tables that only go up to 6. So what's 6 x7? You'll never know. Best to buy a book like Signature Licks and figure out the details of playing on your own. You can do it."
5,The more things change........,"This is a kick a** album. One of the more known hard rock bands of the late 80's/90's comes back in solid form with a new frontman. Yeah, it takes a little bit to get comfortable with the new voice, but I think Jaime St James knows how to lay down the lyrics. He certainly has the experience.This is a great album, and I am not just saying this because the mainstream music scene blows either. You could put this right up the with Warrant's early works. My favorite will always be Dog Eat Dog, but this one delivers the goods.............."
2,Didn't work very long.,"My daughter got this for Christmas and it hasn't lasted 6 months. The lever to push the toast down stopped working. She didn't play with it that much, to have worn it out... Just not made very well."
2,"Now, Nothing But A Curio","This album sounded like a monster when it came out, raw, angry and unique. The mesh of samples and dance beats and muscular sound seemed revolutionary, and the band inspired a gaggle of lesser known camp followers like EMF and Certain Distant Suns. Sadly, in retrospect the disc sounds cluttered, muddy and tepid. It's hard now to imagine tracks like `Move Mountains' and `Never Enough' causing a stir, but some albums just don't stand the test of time. Liquidizor is just such an album, if you want to here the band at it's best, try Doubt, which is more mainstream but has stood up better. If you want to hear the sample heavy dance sound at it's best, try Hack by Information Society, that's an album that still has punch. This CD just seems to drag."
3,ACD,I enjoyed the book. I didn't know to much about Cattle Dogs.Its a good basis for first books. But I was hoping it would have gone into more information then it did.
5,"A very informational book, I recommend this book to anyone.","This book has many good pictures, and if your lazy you can learn a lot just from the picture captions. But if you are a reader this book will give you all kinds of great information."
2,Where the hell?,"I have to agree with what someone said about this not being a complete Keith Sweat package. Keep It Comin, Just A Touch and And I'm Dreamin were indeed huge hits that recieved massive radio airplay, and were very popular. The CD just doesnt seem complete w/o those missing songs."
3,Armies of the Carthaginian Wars 265-146 BC,"This book is decent and one of three that I recommend buying to obtain a decent overview of the Carthaginian Army during the Punic Wars. It is the best of the three at the concept of compilation of the Carthaginian Army, but for the most complete understanding, buy all three books."
4,"I love this tool, especially at this price!","Within two weeks of it's arrival, this little tool has become a serious fave for me, whether it's for levelling or marking. I'll never drop a chalkline again! It's ease of use and adaptability are even making me less reluctant to hang wall paper again.Perhaps you can find a brighter laser, or more functionality but you'll pay a lot more for the privilege. Yes, I've seen some of the similar products on the market. The Craftsman level looks nice, but to be honest, I've had quality complaints with Craftsman tools for some time and I'm not anxious to revisit that line."
1,Great idea but needs to be more accurate,"I could think of a thousand uses for this until I discovered that the horizontal level wasn't accurate. I was attempting to align two pictures and found that when the horizontal level bubble showed the unit to be level, it was actually off by about 1 inch every 6 feet.I've contacted the manufacturer and received a reply that the issue was forwarded to the product manager. So far no response from the product manager.So like the title reads, great idea but isn't useful it it's not accurate."
1,Piece of junk,"I bought this thing from a local home improvement store thinking it would be handy to use for hanging items on the wall and providing layout lines for flooring, etc. Wrong! The retractable pins that are supposed to hold it to a wall or ceiling or whatever, retract continuously and it won't stay in place. The laser line is practically invisible so it was of no use even if I had a project where I could just set it on the floor. It does seem to be fairly impact resistant proven by the number of times the pins retracted and it fell off the wall plus throwing it across the room out of frustration didn't seem to hurt it. However, it was a piece of junk before I threw it and it's still a piece of junk. I don't even know where it is anymore and I don't care."
3,The bubble in the level is hard to read.,"This could be such a great tool. The bubble in the level doesn't match up to the lines, making it very difficult to get a true level line. I found I have to balance a small level on top of it to get a true level. Other than that, its great. Maybe the mfr will revamp it."
2,Takes 3 weeks to ship!,I just ordered this item and I was told that the delivery estimate is 2 - 3 weeks by UPS! You may want to reconsider this if you want it as a Christmas present.
4,"Not bad, for a plastic machine.","Despite all of the negative reviews about this product I decided to purchase one anyway. I don't know how to knit and wanted to make some scarves for Christmas gifts. I got it at Walmart on sale for $20. I have successfully made 10 scarves and the machine is still working perfectly. As with any cheap plastic toy from China it has to be handled carefully or it will break. I found the directions rather difficult to understand, therefore I would not recommend this for a young child. I used Fun Fur Bulk 5 yarn for my scarves. Anything heavier will not feed through properly and would probably result in the handle breaking (as I've read a lot of people have experienced). In my opinion this is a great little machine if you use it properly."
3,"ok, for a while","I got this for my 10-year-old daughter for Christmas. It seems to knit tubes OK. We knitted a pair of socks and are working on a tube scarf. In general, it didn't drop stitches.Unfortunately, when we tried to use the square knitting setting, it frequently dropped the end stitch and the yarn would catch on the needles. Also, my daughter would forget which way she should be turning the crank and it would drop stitches. I could get it to work OK.Changing colors didn't work well either because the knotted thread wouldn't pass through the tension arm. I dropped a bunch of stitches before I realized the knot was stuck.The gears have started to sound like they are slipping (loud clicking). I hope they aren't wearing out already.3 stars because it knits tubes OK. A child will need adult help."
2,I love and hate this machine.,"I love and hate this machine. My first two scarves turned out great which was exciting because I am not a knitter. I tried several different types of yarns (in case some were too thick for machine) for a 3rd scarf but the machine crank kept clicking and having issues even with the thin yarns. Like the other reviews, I believe the plastic design just wasn't created to last long. I wish this was a more durable machine because I really enjoyed it when it worked....very bummed it is no longer working after 2 scarves."
1,biggest waste of money,"I cant beleve how much this thing sucks. Its frusturating and doesnt work. If you really want a knitting machine, save your money up to buy one of good quality. Even as an experianced loom knitter, i found this to be compleatly worthless."
3,Concept is flawed,"This product is of good quality, but it doesn't do much. I understand that if you have a 500mm lens and want something to support its weight, then it makes sense, but this will not replace a tripod, in fact it does not even come close to the effectiveness of IS (image stabilizer). I was looking for something to stabilize my camera in low light conditions (using the zoom) and this does not work."
2,Disappointed,"This monopod looked well designed -- comfortable grip, light weight, extra length, easy-to-use swivel head, very compact. Unfortunately, after just 3 uses, the bottom lever just snapped off with hardly any pressure. The plastic is too brittle to support the pressure of holding the leg in place. Other users have noted this defect as well. I can't see any way to repair this. Adorama's return policy requires you to return defective products within 14 days, with complete packaging intact. I really wish this monopod had been made of more quality materials for the levers -- it really was perfect in every other way. Now it's unusable."
5,Excellent and compact... love the monopod,"The retractable monopod is nice to have at events if you don't feel like toting around a tripod. Great product, very fast shipping, very reasonable price."
5,Outstanding - and I'm very picky,"My third monopod purchase, and for being the average Dad that just wants to film his family, THIS IS THE ONE!!! By far the best value for < $30. I bought 2 other no-names from eBay that were either wobbly, or the ball head was horrible. This one allows you some movement (what I REALLY wanted), but also locks down confidently on the average camera or camcorder.Outstanding product for $30.I can only speak to my experience, but would imagine this would satisfy any expert or enthusiast's needs. VERY sturdy. Not a bit of wobble when fully extended.Outstanding!! (Did I already say that!)"
4,Instructive,It would of been nice if there had been a booklet included with this video with notes and tab. However it is very instructive to see how Bob plays the licks. He breaks it up in logical parts and plays it several times at low and intermediate speeds.
2,"Not his best, and poor recording quality","Roger Wagner was one of the great choral conductors, but this was not the album I was hoping it was. (He had a double album I've been trying to find for years; wonderful arrangements and performances of traditional carols.) But my disappointment wasn't just because it wasn't the album I hoped to find: this sounded like it was poor sound engineering even by the standards of its day -- or they used substandard equipment or processes to transfer it to CD. It sounded murky, muddy, flat, and far away, like listening to a choir practicing in another room. I ended up giving it away."
1,false facts,"This is the son of Starla. This book contains many lies. I lived in the house with Jack Barron. Jack and my mother did not have sex. There are also many other false facts and disgusting lies. I find it offensive that my mothers name has been drug into the dirt by this book. Also, just to let everybody know, my parents never finaled the divorce and are still very hapily married. I just thought everybody should know this. To the author, you're an ill informed sad example of a man and you should have got your facts straight before you wrote this terrible book. This is something I thought every reader should know. I lived with the psycho Jack Barron the author didn't."
3,This is my favorite hair product however I won't order from this company again because over half of the cans of spray that I rec,I will not order from this company again because over have of the bottles of spray that I received are inoperable. The spray nozzle is defective. I am not able to return them because I removed them from the box when I received them and stored them.
4,IT HOLDS WELL,"I JUST STARTED USING IT, BUT IT SEEMS TO HOLD WELL & HELPS KEEP THE BODY IN MY HAIR W/O THE STIFFNESS."
2,Good...While It Lasted,"The battery lasted less than one year and it is NOT replaceable. Better products at cheaper prices are available and one can replace the battery, if necessary."
4,enjoyable music,Enjoyable soundtrack to a good movie filmed in the beautiful coastal town of Beachport in South Australia.It reminds me a bit of the Local Hero soundtrack.
3,"Good, not great","I appreciate the fact that these cats don't need to cuss like crazy, and they do have skill. But I wasn't feelin the beats too much and I just couldn't connect with the lyrics that well. I prefer Jurassic 5 over these guys any day. Not a bad album, but not my cup a tea."
2,Great paper - lousy packaging!,"I've ordered 6 reams of this paper because it is the only 28-lb 'tabloid' paper I can find at this price to create my newsletter with. I don't know who is packing this stuff, but EVERY ream has arrived with the outer wrapping completely destroyed! Even the box that had 4 reams in it with the manufacturer's logo all over the box; each ream was trashed on the inside. The paper is all still usable, but how hard is it to either package this stuff better or improve the quality of the wrapper? It makes it very difficult to store the reams when they are falling out of their wrapper."
2,Fairly good paper but damaged wrapper,"I wouldn't say this is great paper, but very good paper. It is bright white, fairly heavy and sturdy and has a medium smooth surface. I was hoping after looking at the online information at the Domtar site that the surface would be very smooth as they list it as having a smoothness of 60, which is a very low number. The main problem was the paper cover containing the ream was torn very badly and wasn't even protecting the paper. There were pieces of tape on tears in the paper cover, which held up, so it seems the ream had been damaged but was sold as new. I reported the problem and asked for a $5 partial refund. The $5 was refunded and most of the paper is usable. I also asked that information regarding selling damaged goods on Amazon was passed along so that this wouldn't happen again. About 10 sheets on one side of the ream had a knife cut in the center and many have damaged corners."
1,beware of non polar dealers with super low prices,yes your getting a great price but polar wont honor warranties from non polar authorized dealers. these people buy from 3rd parties thats why the price is so low. so if some tech prob goes wrong just throw it in the garbage because you wont be able to fix the problem.
3,Touching Wild Horses,This movie is good for Jane Seymour/Horse Lovers.Service from provider was great. Delivered quickly.
4,Great Album!! 7 good songs.,"I think this is one of his better albums to date. Songs like : 1. Ring My Bell, 3. Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song), 4. Somebody's Me, 5. On Top Of You, 6. Tired Of Being Sorry, 8. Wish I Was Your Lover, and 10. Stay Here Tonight, are all great songs, it has a good blend of a great beat, good lyrics and the soulful voice of Enrique that puts these songs among his greatest yet and it rivals his past albums. I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of Enrique and a fan of good music in general."
5,Phenomenal Woman. Inspirational Story.,"I haven't yet finished my copy of this first work but just today I heard Janis Kearney speak for the third time during a series of events here in Birmingham, AL- at both Miles College & the Birmingham Civil Rights Institute. I have been overwhelmed with emotion by both the literal and symbolic convergence between myself and the author. I KNOW that each person in the audience today and the previous two identified with the author in one way or another. Her story is that of any person who has ever dared to dream AND BELIEVE that DREAMS CAN & OFTEN DO COME TRUE. For those individuals who have not ventured to imagine the possiblities let this bio of her early beginnings until today be something of a testimonial or road map to realizing the potential within you- and each of us. I highly recommend that you purchase this book but also make it a point to attend a Kearney speaking engagement if ever afforded the opportunity."
4,Great start,Get started quickly on guitar with this dvd....all basics are covered including chords and scales and styles and such that will get you going right away.
3,Nice headband despite the high price,"Very nice headband but not sure why it's $24. That seems like a lot for a piece of fabric that goes around your head. It is nice fabric, though, and looks better and stays on better than other headbands I've worn."
1,Cape Cod Reader,"Sadly, this was my introduction to Chris Bohjalian's work. His work came highly recommended, but I found Water Witches quite silly; the subject matter almost laughable. Reading it, I felt like a disinterested observer; hoping something interesting would happen. Except for Scottie, the characters were unlikeable. The story was too predictable, and I sincerely wished the ending - as foreshadowed early in the book - would have turned out differently. I took nothing away from this book, except that I felt had."
4,Water Witches,"Not Bohjalian's best book, but wonderful just the same. Good development of characters, interesting story line, unique subject matter. Recommend to adults and teens!"
2,water witches review,"This story suffered from poor writing. The author broke the cardinal rule of ""don't tell, show"". Again and again instead of showing us the story, the author told us the story. Another issue was that there seemed to be three, possibly four stories, within this book with only a minimal connection to each other. The second half of the book had little connection to most things that had happened in the first half of the book. The change brought upon the central character seems unsupported in that we didn't fully understand why he was the way he was before or after the change. The central character seems to be nearly devoid of emotions throughout the entire book so it is hard to care what happens to him. Buried somewhere in here is possibly a good tale. However, a different storyteller would need to present it in order for us to care about this tale."
5,sheets,"My husband and I love these sheets. They are a thick heavier sheet that is not only substantial but soft. I wasn't sure I would like the sheen, but they look great on the bed. I have washed them 5 times now and they still fit our bed with ease. There is also plenty of tuck room at the bottom. I now have a problem getting out of bed in the morning...the sheets feel soooo good."
3,Not the best Woody Herman. Look for songs like Bijou,"The Title misleads people. This is not the greatest Woody Herman. Make sure you get Four Brothers, Bijou, Caldonia, Wildroot, Apple Honey, etc. if yoy want the best Herman."
3,not so cool,"This is a pretty fun toy but I was a little disapointed with it. At first I enjoyed it alot but then it got boring.When I saw the comercial for it, it looked so cool. The kids made it look like a really fun toy. All it is is practically a normal ball because when you push it into a disk you don't have time to do anything with it because it pops back into a ball. But if you like it that's fine."
5,Illusion Through The Eyes of Marko,"Marko Kovacevic was incredible, adding innuendo to his character's part with the brightness or dullness of eyes, a slight change of facial expression, or merely a change of emotion. Superb acting by this young actor. The movie told the story of a young boy growing up in Macedonia, complete with his country's occupation by American soldiers, a dysfunctional family led by a drunken father, and living in fear of the local gang of boys who beat him up regularly. Marko had a bright talent for writing poetry, and he could feel his creativeness grow and become a road out of his miserable life. But as you watch this bright young mind attempt to crawl out of the everyday brutality of living, you can witness the extinguishing of that brightness as a cigarette being crushed out in an ashtray. Beautiful boy, gripping drama, decently filmed, well worth watching."
5,Excellent,This is not your usual Hollywood fare but if you are looking for quality East European cinema you can't go much wrong with this. Ultimately its about a kid that is misled into the wrong life path and the ultimate conclusion is chilling to say the least. This is not entertaining; it is rather compelling and should be seen.
3,I Agree - Not the most comfortable,I agree with previous review - not the most comfortable. I wouldn't buy these again.
2,Bridget Jones she is NOT!!!!!!!!,"""The Cigarette Girl"" was none too appealing to me at all. I was expecting a Bridget Jones type story and got some hard-to-follow mishmash. Elizabeth was a picky, sex-starved female who could not make up her mind. I'd say, folks, wait for the paperback version to come around!"
3,"Oh, those darn morals!","An entertaining beach read or the perfect way to pass the time on a long flight. I loved Elizabeth's story; I loved her phrasing and her smart, sarcastic, witty way with words (especially the way she starred in her own personal movie) But the ending ruined it for me.:::Sigh::: I was SO disappointed in her choice of settling for occasional sex with someone who has other obligations. Call me old-fashioned, but she deserves a man who appreciates the ""poetry"" in her and can commit to her alone."
1,"The sound is great, but the software...","Net MG Jukebox 2.2 is so buggy as to make one wonders how Sony dares to bundle it with such a nice MD player, and expect customers to swallow it. It effectively renders the MD player useless if you want to transfer MP3 files from a PC to Minidisc. As that was main main interest, I'm thinking in returning it."
3,fair,"The out side Plastic wrap was torn, The ream of paper had been dropped & a few sheets were damaged.PTBarnum"
3,Color Fades After a While,"I purchased this for my newborn last year, at first it was OK, but after several washes the color starts fading"
5,It's got good detail,It seems a little daunting at first to try to read but after you get the hang of it it's got lots of detail you may not find on a planisphere.
5,Must have for observers,"As a beginner, I didn't like this much. However, as I developed my observing skills, I really LOVE this! This is really a requirement if you're going to get serious about observing.If you're new to astronomy, hold off a bit and pick up a good guidebook instead, like Turn Left at Orion, Nightwatch, and Star Watch. Once you get through those, then you can find things on your own, without a computer, using this atlas. I have a computer on my dob, but it's more fun to star hop using this guide than to just type it in and push.Think of this as a map to the universe. In fact, that's what it is! You wouldn't go on a trip without a good map, would you?"
4,Still learning,"I haven't used this book much yet, because I am still a rank beginner in backyard astronomy. However, I can tell by its organization and layout I will get a lot of use out of it as I get better acquainted with the night skies."
1,Don't buy until fixed.,Loaded on Kindle but was not full screen and was hard to see charts. When I tried to load on IPhone 5 and IPad 2 it would not download using Kindle App. Talked to Kindle people for 30 minutes with no luck. They told me it would be worked on and will be calling me back in 24 to 48 hours.
2,Complicated,I bought this for my husband at Christmas because we like to stargaze (casually) and wanted something with basic instruction. This book is for somebody who is serious about astronomy - not a casual binocular stargazer.
1,Save Your Money,"Not even Adrian Paul can save this one! His part was awful, (the character, not him personally). The budget for making the film must not have included enough to pay for lighting. This movie proves that there are some things that are better in the dark. Save your money on this one."
1,Bug Filled - Game Won't Start,Bought this game and returned it the next day. What kind of game doesn't start after you install it? I have a new system and have never had this problem with any other game. Save yourself some grief and buy something else.
2,Great Module poorly done,"I loved this module when it came out. I saw this and I was thrilled. Finally, they had done what I wanted done for so long. I bought it and installed it. Started off very fun. Then I played longer. I can not get any of my quest outside of Hommlet to update. I have been in contact with Atari and tried their suggestions and they don't work. This game is just not worth the money. I had to stop playing because not being able to complete the quests makes the game difficult and not very fun. Hopefully they will try to correct all the problems they have."
3,Flawed but Fun,"The complaints about the bugs in TOEE are legit, there are some really frustrating ones here and there, but not enough to ruin the fun. The shame is that there could have really been one of the truly great computer RPGs if it had been fully implemented"
4,Not bad if you're desperate,"If you love single player, multi-character RPGs like I do, then you'll dig TEE. It's no where near BGII, but it will keep you entertained for a few weeks. The only thing that slightly annoys me is that it's turn based, which goes a little slower than the space-bar pause games like BGII."
4,If you like awesome tactical combat......,"The combat in this game is so deep you will need scuba gear. The game has wonderful graphics and the spell effects are grade A. Yes there are quite a few bugs, but a patch is coming later in October so I wouldn't worry about it. I have a 1GHz Athlon and with a 64 mb video card (Windows Me) and it runs decent, some slow up with lots of monsters on screen at one time. If you ever played the PnP version then it is a must buy! In summary, short on story but exceptional combat. (The adventure this game is based on was a hack'n'slash event, thus the computer version is also hack'n'slash)."
3,An awesome game with limitations and tons of bugs,"I would say if it was not for the incredible amount of bugs that this game is excellent. I will definately want to wait out a patch from Troika and Atari.If they added in higher levels than level tens with subsequent spells and abilities, that would help. There are bugs with enchanted item creation as well, and some of the quests cannot be completed either because of various bugs. There is also the occasional lockup or program crash, so make sure you save your game often."
3,Hold out for the patch!!,"I was anxiously awaiting the release of this game! It has so much potential! Excellent grpahics, and an interesting new take on the DnD game system set in the original Greyhawk campaign. It's too bad Atari & Troika rushed to get the game to market - the game quality is severely lacking!Items do not have full descriptions.The scrolling speed is woefully slow.Many of the item creation and skills/feats do not work as described.Do yourself a favor because I believe the game is worth playing - Wait for the patch!"
3,NO NO NO NO NO,"Oh my Godthis game could have been awesome, but there are some bugs that get SO FRUSTRATING that, while playing, you suddenly realize you're not having fun anymore, but instead you are trying to get around all the problems to win that impossible dungeon battle out of sheer hatred for your overpower enemies and reckless game producers.I have a LAWFUL GOOD cleric, worshipper of Pelor (a Neutral Good god) and he spontaneously casts INFLICT WOUNDS SPELLS!!!! WHAT THE HELL IS THIS???I sure hope a patch is coming out. If it doesn't, damn it's gonna be a shame. The game just looks awesome... such a waste."
1,Horrible,"the mapppin system is atrocious the whole game is horrible. Absolutely do not buy this game, i love roleplaying games and this was painfull just to even attempt to play. The best part is creating ur party at the beginning, however when ya get into the game to actually play its not even worth it. DOn't waste ur time or your money"
3,"Pretty good game, if it wasn't for all the glitches in code.","Coding on the disks has a tremendous amount of glitches. Even updates have bugs and generally community-developed patches should be used[1]. Once properly patched, it's a pretty good RPG (D&D3.5; rule-set) game to relax to. It allows the player to operate in multiple perspectives simultaneously. Includes single-player and online features.[1]Install the game, apply first two official patches, then add [...] patches."
3,Great game but.........,"It only works on the older Glass T.V.'s. Will not work on Plasma's,High Definition, and Flat Screens. Find an 20"" older T.V. and the game is great. I guess that's why the price went from $40.00 to $17.00"
4,PlayTV Huntin' 3,"The gun is a good size. It takes a little while to get the aiming down, but it's a lot of fun when you do. Not realistic hunting, but that's not what I was looking for, a 7-year old was the recipient. He loves it!"
3,NEED ADAPTOR,"I was buying this for a friend that was sick and couldnt go hunting. He liked it but the only problem was that it doesnt come with the easy red,white,and yellow plugs for your tv."
3,Excellent except,"I love Pooch pads. It is great to be able to use the product over and over again but the down side is that after the 2nd wash the thread around the edges unraveled. If you can't wash them and they hold together, they are not worth much. This was the second batch I purchased and the first is still doing very well. So I guess it can go either way. I don't think I would purchase unless I owned a sewing machine."
5,The best strategy role playing ever,This game is not only a role playing game it is a strategy game also. You build experience and skills as you go through the game. You also find different weapons and you have the ability to cast some awsome looking spells. You can cast the fly spell that allows you to fly all over the map. The graphics in this game were unbelievable. The best graphics for the Sony I have seen so far. This game is a must have if you are tired of easy to beat games. This game offers a serious challenge even to the most extreme gamers. It will take you about a year to beat this one if you play it every day. So the fun lasts a long time. This is the best game for the Sony. I even like this game better than most Sony 2 games. 5 stars for this amazing game.
5,Fits My Computer!,"I have a 15.4 inch widescreen inspiron 6000 from dell, and this backpack actually fits my computer! I love it. I have had a really rough time finding bookbags that weren't black and that weren't overly huge but could hold my computer and my law school books! I give it an A+ and would definitely recommend it for anyone else with a 15.4 in widescreen computer."
2,Doesn't Hold Position,"The lamp looks great, with nicely finished arms and bulb dome; however, the hinges are both very weak, and are unable to hold the dome in the position one desires. I put a smallish 40 w bulb in to reduce the weight in the head of the lamp, but invariably it folds at the center and base hinge, leaving the bulb only 16 inches or so above the desk -- not effective for lighting a large area. The hinges are just too weak to support the weight of the dome AND a light bulb. I am already looking for another lamp that will stay in the position that I set it. Price and appearance, 4 stars; functionality, 1 star. Overall, two stars."
4,"The first visual guide of Doctor Who, great!!!","This is the first of all visual guides of BBC Doctor Who.Ir shows the 9th Doctor and Rose, but almost the 70% of the Book is about the oldest Doctor's foes ! Like the Daleks. Very detail visuals about the Sliteen and other enemies of the 9th Doctor. It is a must for any Doctor Who Fan. This books are far more educational and complete than the Doctor Who enciclopedia, buy all the volumes with the great visuals and detail explanations rater than the ""Enciclopedia"""
2,3 or 4 decent songs....,"This debut from cpm 22 got some nice punk pop songs like regina let's go, o mundo dá voltas e 60 segundos...but also got a lot of mellow EMO crap and some really childish lyrics! If you want some good hardcore from BRAZIL try RAIMUNDOS or RATOS DE PORO!!!!!"
2,No replacement tires,I purchased this bike last summer for my then 3 year old grandson. He really wasn't able to ride it until recently and probably rode the bike a total of 2 times. We noticed that the tire was flat and tried to put air in it. To our surprise the tire was bad and we have been unable to find a replacement. I cannot believe that after two rides the bike is useless. Buyer beware!
3,COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM PICTURE!,"This is the second time I've ordered something on Amazon.com and received something that looks nothing like the picture. Yes, the bike I received is a Spiderman bike, but it is YELLOW with a yellow seat with small spiderman characters on it and a web-throwing spiderman on the wheels and handlebar guard. My son's favorite color is BLUE, so this is VERY DISAPPOINTING!"
2,I bought these because it had some of the best reviews but,the holes are way to small for my earrings. And I don't wear huge or even large earrings so I was disappointed to say the least. I can still use them but it is a super tight fit (really hard to get them on the posts) and just not worth the hassle. For tiny posts I guess they would be great - but I'd never seen such tiny posts.
1,Only for completists,"I purchased this because I liked a quote from it that was featured in Marshall McLuhan's ""Understanding Media.""Apparently, that excerpt is the most well-written part of the entire thing. The book is filled with every cliche one can imagine -- far beyond the ones necessary to be considered in the noir genre. It borders on stupid."
4,Good murder story,"For a first time novel this is an excellent story. It has a good plot line, and great descriptions."
4,It held my interest............,"Good read. Richly textured with nice portrayals for the Harvard area of Cambridge and vicinity. Richly developed characters as well. The author's familiarity with the business school environment makes for a credible story. Also, the increasing complexity of the tale pulls the reader in. If you like stories with people from different socio-economic strata crossing paths, this one is for you."
4,"Interesting, but poorly written","Pelton's accounts of the darker parts of our globe are interesting, particularly the cannibalism in Sierra Leone and the eerie safety of North Korea. However, I feel he doesn't collect the wealth of experience he has and weave it into gold. Rather, he writes an adrenaline junkie's Fodor book, if you will. The result is quite entertaining, but I can't help but wonder how a Krakauer or a Sebastian would have made the material riveting. That's my two cents, anyways."
3,two out of three ain't bad,Poison Ivy was great. It had the feeling of a thriller. The second one did not. I found myself fastfowarding to get passed the poor dialogue and it definately had nothing to do with the first. The third was a bit like a porno but had the feel of a thriller more like the first. Both the original and the sequels have very different plots and seem more like completely different films to me.
3,For Alyssa Fans Only,"If you love Alyssa Milano then you will love her in this movie. If you don't like her then you will hate it. Milano is absolutely stunning and does very well from innocnet Lily to seductress Lily. Unfortunatly the script is awful and the movie drags on and on.Alyssa doesn't even get the pleasure of working with talented actors which could have made the movie better.Xander Berkely is awful and unappealing as the art teacher and I cringed whenever he was in a scene. Jonathan Scheach did what he could in a role that had no substance whatsoever. This film is shot beautifully and the director does everything she can to make Alyssa look beautiful in every shot. As I said if your an Alyssa fan get this movie, if your a fan of Poison Ivy with Drew Barrymore, just watch that one again."
2,don't waste your money,"The only thing this thing does well is play dvd's and tapes. As for dubbing ,that's a joke. I've owned it for over six months and can't get it to dub anything nor record from tv. Customer service is laughable- after FINALLY getting a rep to answer my call I still didn't get an answer. Basically I paid way too much money for a player. What a piece of junk."
2,Does not work with ipad2,"Appears well made, but does not work with ipad2. May work with other touch screens. You may want to order this before the pen to see if the cost of a lamy and the refills is worth it."
5,"We are still dying, drug Co getting richer!","Few years ago I would be sceptic, while reding this book. Not now, after we find out what they did to electric car and many other scandals because they are rich and powerful corporations. I belive that they are hiding the truth because the the truth is cheap and available cancer cure! Five of my cancer friends dyed already thanks to chemotherapy and radiation. One who refuse those treatments survivied the longest. I recomend this book to anybody who is searching for truth in this mess created by rich corporation!"
5,Gran dueto Pop,Cada disco de Amaral es excelente. Definitivamente son de las pocas cantantes (en este caso duetos) en español que logran hacer buena música y no la basura comercial que sale en la radio hoy en día.
1,Significant Discrepancy,"The toy received was not as it is advertisedSinging Birthday Bear. It does not look like a bear, very skinny. face like a cat, skin looked like as a used toy. I do not recommend to buy this toy at all. The rating is not even a one start. It looks like a false advertisement. Be aware."
1,good luck,"Good luck trying to get this game to run! I've been emailing atari,compaq,creative for over a month now,installed more ram,reflashed my bios installed new mouse drivers,cd drivers,vidio & sound card drivers. I'll probably have a very large tech support bill = to several times the cost of the game.Atari was the least helpfull of the three tech supports. 1.2gig n 80gig hd n 384k of ram n it willnot run on my machine"
1,Frame shipped was defective,"I got this frame in order to match one I already had.I was very disappointed when I realized the frame wasdefective. I couldn't insert the plastic slides intothe frame without causing seriuos damage to the ""wood"".I didn't have this problem with the first frameI purchased, of course I bought it elsewhere."
5,Baroque phrasing with Hungarian expression,"I'm biased, of course, since he was my beloved violin teacher. But all his students are biased.His playing is like no other - molto espressivo but deliciously phrased and tasty.He still inspires me today! Love him to bits. What a great musician."
2,Poor level design,"I play a lot of video games and my daughter picked this up for about 10 minutes and knew she would not like it (not a picky 5 years old either). I was hoping for some interesting game play, but none of that going on here. It does not handle touch response very well and is janky on the rendering and frame rate. Plus there is no sense of ""mission"" in the game. No purpose to the story. It says ""tales"" in the title and there are no tales to be told. Unfortunate misuse of the license I'm afraid.&#8203;"
3,It is what it is....plastic,"Not good quality, it is plastic. I knew this, but it was worse optically than expected."
1,Don't waste your money,Mirror foggy at perimeter. Reflection in middle is poor. Mirror is adjustable but I didn't install since felt the quality was so poor and felt removing would be a problem. Don't waste your money on this product.
3,"cheap, functional but scratched","This works well as a cheap rear view mirror in my office cubicle. The adhesive seems strong and it was easy to attach to the top of a computer screen.The mirror surface was scuffed and scratched. The imperfections are not severe enough to reduce functionality, but they're still annoying when my eye catches them."
1,rene,This is not adjustable as advertised. Very disappointing to see that it was advertise as ADJUSTABLE....this is fixed..it will make you mad. Don't order it. It doesn't deserved even a bit of a star.
2,Reiki,I was disappointed. The book is too esoteric. Difficult to read - at least for me. Not impressed with the content. Maybe it's me: I'm a new Reiki practioner - maybe the book is intended for a level or two above me.
3,Expected more,So first and foremost I suppose I should not have bought the book based on the title as Usui was never a Dr to the best of my knowledge. It had standard information that can be found in many other places and a few hand positions that I had not previously seen. The book made mention of a few other techniques like tapping but never covered them at all. So besides learning a few new hand positions and also learning some different combinations that are recommended for a variety of illnesses there was little to gain from the book. Basically not nearly as useful as most of the other books in my collection.
1,Garbage!,This was one of the worst books I have ever read bar none! Total complete garbage!I would give 0 stars if I could!
1,YUCK!!!,I absolutely hated this book. Alex was an awful character and Zena did not deserve sympathy for her plight. I even disliked the ending which I assume alludes to another book on Alex's son - maybe not but who really cares. Don't bother reading this book unless you love to hate the main characters of the books you read.
1,Thisbook does not even deserve one star.,"I picked up this book because I wanted to try a new author. I started to read it and it was good and everything. I didn not finish because this book is just awful. All I can say is EEEEWWWWWW. Those sex scenes and the rape is horrible. Please do not subject yourself to to this book. At least in other books when the hero rapes, you know it is the woman he ends up with and she usually is willing. She is raped and fondled by awful men.DO NOT READ!!!!"
2,no way to judge size!,This product would be fine for a cat or a very tiny dog. The ad does not specify that and therefore the purpose I purchased it for is useless.
3,Not bad,"It does its job until the amount of food in the tank is low. I guess the food gradually being pushed into the bow because of gravity, hense, it just kind of stucked in the bottom of the tank but not to the bow when the amount from the tank is low."
3,okay,"i used this to make yogurt and it worked to well, (or maybe i processed too long) but i got lots of whey and a cheesy yogurt that with a little more time would be ricotta cheese. the stuff was very active. i will try to make cheese the next time. seems a little pricey as you can get a good greek yogurt to start your process for around a buck. i will try a smaller amount of starter to see if it can be more cost effective."
5,GREAT YOGURT STARTER,A Very good yogurt starter...once u make yogurt with this culture u will never go back to buying yogurt from Supermarket ever again!!!!
1,Disappointed,I purchased a whole gallon of Neem Oil and put it on my flowers. It made them look really rough at first. They are getting some better. Put it on my garden plants and my tomato and pepper plant blooms are dying. I mixed it just like the directions say to and applied it at the right time. I was really hoping this stuff would work :(
5,used for business...,Good solid shoe covers. Seem to be in line with all the others we have ordered in the past as far as quality goes...
3,"weird, sexy, and interesting.","i read this in about 5 hours. sometimes i think steinke overdoes it with the artsy-stream of consciousness style prose, but the story is good enough. frankly, jesse could use some therapy and a lifetime of prozac.i have lived in san francisco three years, and there's something about reading a book set in the town you live that makes its more interesting. and people say san francisco is not as decadent as it once was ? i guess it depends where you look."
3,It was okay,"This book was okay. I think it tried too hard to be dark and sullen. I prefer other books, such as Brass."
2,It's worth reading once...,"I got this book following in the line of this being part of modern popular literature that delves in the subgenres and subcultures currently in existance. I'ev enjoyed similar books by authors such as Allende, Welsh, Rushkoff, and of course Nicholson Baker (Vox in particular). I have an affinity for the rather broad subject area. I read through it and it really wasn't all that bad, but it was a little lackking in description and content. I wasn't drawn in like I have been with other books. I will keep the book as it is my style. I have since read through it again. The second reading did help clarify a few things, but still I don't love it. I do recommend reading it at least once. I also recommend referring it to a friend. If you get it, try finding at a lirary or used bookstore, though. Cheers!"
4,Best of Victor Borge Act one and two,Very intertaining. I got this video to pass Victor Borge down to my grandkids--- they had never heard of him but enjoyed him immensely.
2,Boring,"Mr. Borge has some great acts, but in between the acts there was alot of time taken up with him looking out at the audience and making funny faces. I would rather it had been shorter with more acts."
5,Getting Along is Matter of Type,"This is an easy read into the world of the Enneagram ... and its concepts of 9 basic personality types and their core drives and key characteristics. While most other books on the subject are more in depth this is a quick study into the notion that being you CAN make sense. Even more important, the Enneagram book tells us HOW to get along with one another with its insights into the various types and their ""wings"". Knowing tendancies along with basic character and temperament are fascinating and helpful in a sea of personalities we must deal with. Check out this guide and see what you discover about you."
3,Way too dumbed-down,"Don't get me wrong, I LOVE dummy-type books. In fact, the easier an author makes it to learn, the better. Unfortunately, this is WAY too dumbed-down. Further, I found inaccuracies in the descriptions of the types. If you want thorough books about the enneagram, buy those by Susan Rhodes. She is very thorough and inspiring."
5,"Soft, light, warm, and fluffy; I love it!","This coat is light, soft, and warm. I can't over-emphasize the words ""light"" and ""soft"". I love that this coat is fluffy. It is also waterproof and performs well in the rain. I really use it as an everyday coat. Great for short walks with my daughter and taking her to the park."
3,"GOOD CONTENT, BADLY WRITTEN","Roland Bessette's ""Mario Lanza"" is a good object lesson about the price of fame and an interesting survey course in the career of this gifted but horrifyingly troubled tenor.But attorney Bessette's book proves that as a writer, he makes an excellent lawyer. Bassette's sentence structure, confusing and contradictory information and feeble attempts at humor all mar what is otherwise a well researched work on a man about whom the author obviously cares.Here in Philadelphia, Mario Lanza is something of a diety: its good to see the record set straight. In the end, it seems his failings make his accomplishments all the brighter. If only Mr. Bessette had had what today is that rarest of all things: a good editor."
1,Garbage - Lanza deserves better treatment. Pure tabloid.,"This book makes supermarket tabloids look like great literature. It centers on, and magnifies every negative aspect of Lanza's life, and does little to give description to one of the greatest tenor voices of the century. Even when his voice is given praise, it is usually tinged with negative commentary. Much is drawn from previous biographies (Callinicos, Bernard, Robinson) which makes this a rather lazy effort that brings little else of a factual matter to light. The only redeeming quality of this work is the inclusion of rare photos which Lanza fans will enjoy. You can forget the rest as worthless."
5,Good quality fair price,"The product was nicely packaged, and the discs seem to be of good quality. Rarely do I experience a digital interruption of the kind that indicates a disc quality issue. Sound track is clear. The navigation menus are easy to use. The price is reasonable."
5,Twilight Zone Definitive Collection,Not as discribed.NO CLOSED CAPTIONED as stated. Unfortunately we only discovered it once the package was opened. I puchased it as a gift for a friend but without the captions it is worthless to her.I am going to request my money back for their infraction.:-[
4,Definitive TZ,"This indeed is complete, as it includes plot summaries, cast, and background information for all of the episodes. The only quibble is that the episodes do not appear in any logical order."
2,discs are great but...,The cases are loose and the discs fall out easily and can be scratched. The set is great and the fold up case is great but would be best if in a disc holder.so discs dont fall out
5,The Search Is Over!,"I have been a huge fan of this show since I was little and have been searching for the box set for ages! When I saw this, I was extremely excited. I have always wanted to watch this more than just on tv on New Years. The complete box set on DVD? Yes, Please! The product was shipped in hardly anytime at all and was wrapped/protected well. I couldn't be happier with this purchase."
2,Somewhat disappointing,"we have all the cars from the movie and thought our 2 yo boy would like these town items. We also bought Flo's V-8 Cafe and it is more fun...however, you do get a bunch of the more popular cars included. The tower of tires is unstable (4 subsets of tires stack on each other) and they need to create a notch for them so as not to fall over so easily. Son really not interested in them. The roof opens up revealing a lift for a car which raises up and allows the car to drive down a very steep ramp.The only things that light up are the words ""casa della tires"" above the garage door. They blink and you cannot tell if they are on unless it is kind of dark in the room.Overall, if you want to collect the town, you gotta get this item.Otherwise, $$ better spent on the figure 8 raceway or mountain raceway which goes with the set."
4,Christmas Time With Eddie Kamae & Sons of Hawai'i,It is a great CD of old time Hawaiian music. I ordered this CD last year and never got it. I really like Amazon.com and see myself using this web site to order future CD's and DVD's over and over again.
2,BriteSmile Toothpaste,"I ordered one tube of their toothpaste because I was so impressed with their To Go pens. It arrived promptly and in New condition. Unfortunately, the ingredients contain Silica; SAND, which my dentist had already forewarned me to avoid because it scrapes off the protective enamel on teeth! It Does work very well, tho. If you're willing to sand your teeth to make them white then I give it a 5 star. Sorry BriteSmile; your ToGo sticks are great."
2,inexpensive for a reason,"I bought these hoping for a less expensive alternative to ""Ace"" bandages. They are thin and not very elastic compared to ""Ace"". They are somewhere between an Ace and Gauze as far as usuability. They are, however, less expensive. I carry them in my bag to hold ice in place. The shipping took so long that I had to go out and buy some real ones locally."
4,King Werner,"This is a great ladder. My only regret is that I should have chosen the 17 foot model instead of the 22 foot. Mainly because of the weight. This is a heavy duty, and heavy weight ladder. If you don't need 22 feet, get the next model down. It will be easier to move around."
4,Fantastic Ladder (but heavy),"This ladder is everything it says it is...super easy to use, can do a million things, it is pretty, etc...Most importantly, it is very, very stable. As someone who does not like heights it provides a lot of confidence that it is solid and stable and safe.Literally the only downside I can find (after about 3 months of use) is that the thing weighs a ton! I don't think there is any way to make it lighter other than, perhaps, making it out of carbon fiber...there is just so much material there. If you're just using it around the house, the weight probably is not a big deal. If you will be lugging it around a lot, however, be sure you can carry it...Gave 4 stars only for the weight issue. I really love this ladder!!"
5,great ladder,"Excellent ladder, very sturdy in all configurations. Love the stability. I would definitely purchase this one again (but I doubt it will ever wear out)."
1,Heavier than Expected!!!,"This ladder was significantly heavier than advertised (42 lbs on Amazon page). The shipping weight on the packing slip was listed as 78 lbs. And, it felt like 78 lbs! I could barely move it from outside the front door to the inside (barely a few feet) without straining my back.Currently returning this item because of the excessive weight.Definitely more of a commercial-use product. I opted for the ClimbTek instead which is MUCH lighter and easy to carry. Plus it packs a bit smaller than this ladder for storage."
1,Don't Bother,"This ladder is okay if you don't have to use it everyday. It is way too heavy. Gorilla and Little Giant are two brands that make models with the same capacity and length that are lighter. I just returned mine to Home depot because the hinge began to bind and metal shavings were coming out of it. The hinge got so tight I could no longer open or close it. It is probably okay for a homeowner, but not for somebody who uses it alot for work as I do, an insurance adjuster."
5,Warner MT 26 Bringing me to new heights,This is a great ladder. This is a very steady ladder and is easy to adjust. It is a little heavy but that was expected given the lengh of the ladder. I did recently buy the shelf as an extra so it is easy to hold things while working.
2,Very Heavy!,"I am surprised that this ladder has such good reviews. It is a very stable ladder that makes you feel safe when you climb it, but the weight of the ladder makes it difficult to maneuver. I think it would be extremely difficult for most elderly or women to use this ladder. I can barely stand to carry it myself!"
4,"Sturdy, easy to use, versatile ladder","Just got this ladder for my home and have used it for several jobs including wrapping the A/C, changing the bulbs on my outdoor floodlights and cleaning rain gutters. It is an excellent ladder at a good price. It is easy to use with no need for instructions. The ladder feels very sturdy and secure in every position without any shaking, creaking or wobble in every position from step ladder to fully extended straight ladder. The J bolts that lock the telescoping ladder in place are thick and feel well made. The telescoping motion is smooth and the spring-loaded J bolts allow me to lengthen the ladder while it was upright without help. It also folds small enough to fit inside my minivan's very small trunk. My only complaint is that it is fairly heavy ladder but that is the cost of sturdiness I suppose."
5,werner mt-22,"This ladder rivals the Little Giant in strength, versitility and quality and beats the pants off of it in price. I've been looking at these for some time and the MT-22 fills the bill. As a retired painter quality and stability have always been a priority in selecting ladders. I can store this in half the space as an extension ladder, yet can still reach the peak of my split-level home. I use the twin steps for scaffuling quite a bit, and I really like the ability to use this on a stairway or over top of shrubery."
4,rock solid,"this thing is HEAVY but rock solid! high quality, sturdy, and adjusts for different needs. I would give it 5 stars if it was a little lighter"
5,Great Product,Purchase this ladder because my extension ladder was to difficult to move around as you use it. The Werner MT 22 is great and works with all the projects needing a ladder
3,Werner Ladder,"This ladder is well made and sturdy. I'm sure it will work in all the configurations it has. My only problem with it is that it is so heavy. May not be the best choice for seniors. But if you are in the trades and accustomed to heavy lifting, this is a great ladder with a lot of flexibility."
3,Werner MT-22 Ladder,This ladder is very well built and adjusts nicely. Only drawback is that it is heavy to move around. Great buy compared to the little giant.
2,Made In China,"Not sure why this wasn't mentioned in any reviews.I thought I was getting an American made Werner ladder like all the others I own,not true. I also agree with other reviewers; too heavy and awkward to position and the height adjustment mechanisms seem cheap, flimsy and doubtful to last. Not sure if I feel comfortable ascending 26 feet off the surface of the earth on any contraption made in China. Disappointed in Werner."
1,Werner Ladder,Excellent. Does what I want and need and it does the job I expected. Nice piece of work Yea Yea
5,A good versitile ladder,"I have had this for about a year and used it on several different types of jobs. It is very stable and the ability to fold into a small space makes it easy to move around. The construction is sturdy and it certainly does not feel cheap at all. The hinges take some effort to lock/unlock, but not too much. A good product and worth the money."
3,ladder,"The price for the ladder was very good, I saved over $50.00 from what I could get it from a retail store like Home Depot. It had free shipping and no sales tax. The ladder was what I wanted as far as a versatile ladder that can perform several job functions. The only problem I had was it had been treated fairly rough in shipment and had a couple of dings in it, more cosmetic than anything else. It was also missing a rivet in one of the cross braces -possible manufacturing defect. I needed the ladder for a major project I was doing so I put a small bolt and nut where the rivet was missing and figured the dings wouldn't hurt anything in the long run. If I hadn't been in such a hurry for the ladder, I might have tried to get a replacement."
3,works great but is heavy,"The ladder is great. It telescopes to heights I couldn't reach before with a standard 8 foot ladder. The best part is it folds up for easy storage when finished. However, this ladder was much heavier than I realized which makes it more difficult to move and my wife wife cannot use it on her own. In addition, there isn't an easy way to carry the ladder because of how the steps are made and positioned."
3,Bent legging. & heavy!,For actual use its a great ladder. The few spots I dislike is the hooks used to secure your adjustments. I feel they were poorly thought out. Hard to pull out and adjust and when weight is applied the torque and don't sit perfectly in not h. To use this ladder you may have to have help. It's truly a heavy beast. I'm 6'3 230 and this thing gives a run for the money. When in operation it's works great. I love the versatility. If you are someone who will occasionally I'd recommend this. Frequent users be Leary. I bought this for 160 so great value here.
5,Great ladder,I've been in the market for a ladder for over a year now. We did a lot of online and in store shopping and this ladder was the biggest one for the money. Handles all of our needs from 'A' frame to extension. We have 18' ceilings and this ladder reaches that and more. Out side the roof is high and the extension part does it's job. This ladder is easy for one person to handle and move. We are very happy and thrilled with this purchase; it was like hitting the lottery. Better than anything I've SEEN ON TV!!! For less money too...
5,Werner MT-22 Ladder is built like a tank. Awesome value for $149,"This is a really nice ladder. Sturdy and very strong. Bought mine at Lowes for $149. I can't imagine the rationale for paying $450 for the comparable Little Giant Ladder. The Werner is very tough. I did buy the wheel kit from Little Ladder Giant ($29). The wheels installed easily on my Werner MT-22. Once the wheels are installed it's easier to push the ladder like a wheel barrow, as opposed to towing it like a wagon.Little Giant 10940 Retrofit Wheel Kit"
5,"fantastic for going up, and down.","It's versatile, tall as you'd ever want and seems sturdy enough. I think it was worth every penny. Two words. ( sorry, thats what was needed to complete the review)"
3,Good But Not the Best,My dad has the Little Giant which I love but can't afford. I tried out a friend's Werner and then a Gorilla at Home Depot. The Little Giant is by far the the smoothest operating. The Gorilla comes in a very close second in operation at half the price. I found the Werner's welds less well done and noticably less stable than the Little Giant or the Gorilla.My decision was to go for the Gorilla. It is nearly as good as the Little Giant. Half the price than the Little Giant and about the same as the Werner. The improved stability of the Gorilla over the Werner clinched it.
2,"Not ""multipurpose"" enough!","Materials and build are good, price is indeedWerner MT-13 300-Pound Duty Rating Telescoping Multi-Ladder, 13-Foothigh, but most importantly this shelf only works with the MT-13 ladder in its stepladder configuration, that is, set up like the letter ""A"". If the ladder is used straight-up, even at the identical angle (about 70 degrees from level) the shelf sharply slopes and is unusable. Since it is when one is up a ladder that a shelf would be most welcome, this is a bizarre design flaw. If the shelf's support brackets had been made adjustable there would be no problem. Back mine goes."
1,Not a 22' Ladder.,"Warning - THIS IS NOT A 22' Ladder!!!!As mentioned elsewhere, the full extension of this ladder is 18' 11"" and it will not reach my gutters!I had to open it to find this out, so how do I return it?"
3,Damaged when received,"I'm sure the ladder is great, but do yourself a favor and make a trip to Lowes, instead of ordering online. I ordered for a xmas gift, because of the free shipping, and it came with packaging all ripped and ladder is dirty and scratched. Now, i will have to return and go to lowes anyway!!"
2,No glow,"The butterfly is larger than any of the other Echo Valley products that I purchased, but as far as glow-in-the-dark is concerned, forget it. As with the other products I purchased (dragonfly, crescent moon, gazing ball), none of them glow-in-the-dark. The paint is really cheap and doesn't work. I put them in one of my gardens that gets full sun for at least eight hours a day. And yet, even with full sun on the most glorious of days, at night there is nothing. You have to get right up on top of them to even notice that there is something there trying to glow. I will not be buying anymore Echo Valley products and I am sorry for the ones I did purchase. For the price, they are certainly a rip-off. Do not waste your money!"
4,Canon EW73B Lens Hood for the EF-S 17-85 f/4-5.6 IS USM SLR Lens,"Good product, good and fairly well made, with a small price, get pleasure from using it."
5,Very usefull,"This small and cheep hood can save you realy a lot of money. It's doeing it job wonderful keeps you pictures brigth and clear, but also the hood protect you lens from a lot of things which trying to hit you lens."
2,"Vignetting, flash use, and manual focus are all a problem using this.","I bought this because it was inexpensive and a Canon product; compared to some of the other hoods on Am. However, as the title states this hood causes some serious vignetting especially when using the cameras build in flash. You will see shadows of the hood in your pics. The other huge problem was that at lower focal lengths when the hood is in reverse you cannot access the manual focus ring. Of course this depends on what lens you are using, but I would have imagined that this would have been considered in designing this hood. I'm not impressed with this. I would recommend this if you know what your getting into. Be warned!"
5,Useful shade,"This shade, made by Canon is much better, a better fit and more sturdy than a generic shade sold by a famous NYC store. It is well worth the price, and does not interfere with the use of filters."
4,Good Weather Station,"After reading some of the other reviews and having just purchased the WS-2315AL I felt I must share my thoughts. I have owned other ""professional weather stations"" that were not as high of quality or provided as much information as the WS-2315AL. I found it easy to install and use after reading instructions. At $100.00 it is a great buy but don't expect it to be a $500.00 weather station either. For the serious weather watcher it is a good weather station."
