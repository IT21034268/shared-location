4,Soylent Green,"My husband thought it was dull and boring, maybe so by todays standards but it scared me when I was kid thinking we might end up this way in the future at the rate the economy is going can it still happen? Scary!"
4,Another Cult Classic,I am a fan of the 70's Doomsday Genre and really like movies like Logan's Run (probably the best one) and The Omega Man. Soylent Green does not dissappoint and the ending scene is one of the best in Cinematic history as you discover what Soylent Green really is!
2,O.k. sci fi film of the 70's with a good twist,Ok if you are reading this you proboly know the secret behind Soylent green becouse that's the only reason this film is still talked about. The secret of Soylent green is the best part of the movie and even that leaves lots of questions to the movie. The story is ok a detective tries to uncover the murder of a man who learned the secret of Soylent products. Almost everyone who discovers the secret dies. The film is a good image of the future and a haunting image of what we eat. The film just ended though there is no ending that mad me mad but I have a good guess of what happend to me Heston (you'll know when you know the secret of soylent green). Overall it was a ok 70's sci fi film.
3,The future is coming,"I remembered seeing this move back in the '70's. I could remember bits and pieces of it. So wanted to watch it again. It was in the theaters in 1973 looking into the future of 2022. Boy, how did they know about Obama care way back then. The future is not that far off. It is a low bucks movie, but who didn't like Charlton Heston back then. I have watched it several times with different people and the reactions are all about the same. ""Oh my gosh that is now"""
1,Population control [gossip],"This movie was made at a time when Paul Ehrlich's ""The Population Bomb"" was causing alarm throughout the academic and cultural elites in this country. Anyone who has taken the time to research will find out the scenarios portrayed in that book have not come to pass. Instead of mass starvation, we have a crisis in obesity in much of the world. The famines we have are largely human-engineered, the result of war and population displacement. It is ludicrous to believe New York City or any other place in 2022 will look anything remotely like it does in ""Soylent Green""."
2,Anohter outdated picture.,"This movie is just all around outdated. Bad acting, Cheap effects, Slow moving and cheesy. Overall: BAD"
5,The Secret Ingredient to Soylent Green ? The Story Itself,"One of the most impressive aspects of this film is how the director or conceptual artist avoided using ""high-tech"" looking props or sets; After all, Soylent Green takes place in a pessimistic future. Instead, the entire story and plot focus on two issues: a murder investigation, and the enigmatic ingredient in the Soylent Green wafers. True, the story takes place in a disintegrating global and human future, yet other directors or creators in other similar sci-fi themes tend to go with the glitz and high tech toys (Bladerunner---though, the use of such props was vital to the story itself as well).This film is highly recommended for those who enjoy science fiction on a more mental than visual level; It does make one think of the future of humanity !"
4,Soylent Green days are coming...,"For Sci-Fi enthusiasts, this is a must. Based on Harry Harrison's ""Make room ! Make room !"", the movie shows an apocalyptic (..but indeed possible..) situation in year 2020. Don't miss it !"
2,Not a fan,"This might have been a good movie several decades ago and the subject matter of overpopulation remains timely. However, the plot loosely hangs together through hyperbolic accusations against an evil Soylent corporation, accusations that go unresolved by the end of the film.If you want an old Heston sci-fi flick, go with Omega Man. Soylent Green will disappoint."
2,Weakest Entry of the Grand Tour Series,"After ""Jupiter,"" which was good, ""Saturn"" was very disappointing. The title should actually have been ""Journey to Saturn"" since precious little time is actually spent AT the ringed planet. I'm sure this is because Bova had ""Titan"" in the hopper and wanted to get a two-fer on Saturn. It's too bad that the author didn't deliver on the title. I wanted Saturn, not this soap opera about a group of malcontents traveling to Saturn. This can only be called science fiction because it takes place in the future and on a space ship. In reality, it is a middling melodrama with Bova's standard-issue corrupt, right-wing Earth government.Read this book if you want to continue to follow the the grand tour series (which is getting long on the tooth but I am hooked...what can I say). Otherwise, avoid it."
1,out of gas,"Dismal writing performance. Just as blah as Clarke's Rama series. The good SciFi writers have all run out of gas. I picked up the book thinking it would be a science adventure like Foster's The Dig, only to discover it was about politics as usual, and maybe 10% reference to things of science. The characters were stereotypical, and you could match item for item how the story was put together with his own SciFI writing method he published. For an early teen audience."
3,"Interesting Premise, But Not Bova's Best Work","I'll certainly commend Ben Bova for his fascinating exploration of the space habitat Goddard as it traverses interplanetary space from the Moon (Selene) to distant Saturn. His prose is most memorable when he describes the layout of the colony and its ten thousand inhabitants. Unfortunately less memorable are his characters, which are not as well drawn as those in his earlier work, most notably ""The Kinsman Saga"". Yet fans of hardcore hi-tech science fiction may not be disappointed with this work, enjoying its vivid descriptions of the colony and its journey across the Solar System, especially its trek into Saturn's vast network of rings and minor satellites."
4,Sweet,"If you love romance inits simplest, warmest, most satisfying form, this novel will be candy to you. Morsi is an expert at giving readers exactly what they want. It offers few surprises, but it delivers exactly what it promises: sweet sexy romance. A pleasant way to spend a rainy Saturday. Oh, and it finally offers a heroine who is able, even encouraged to manage her own life, not become subservient to a man."
3,Pretty decent read,"Sex is pretty explicit, but I liked the plot, it was interesting and well written. I hated the name of the heroine and the fact that people even her lover called her Miss Gussie. It irked me. But other than that it was okay."
1,Not Good,"Did not like this product, had no scent when burned. I think the candle was old. I thought that was a high price to pay. I'm willing to pay the price for a quality product and this wasn't it"
1,Bigger is not better,This massive volume is massive because it is printed in large type with a lot of space between the lines. It is so big it is hard to handle and the same content could be available in much less space if it had been laid out properly. In addition it lacks the numerous photos and particularly the kitchen layouts one would expect in such a huge tomb. Sometimes a layout or a photo is worth a thousand words. Quality of a text is not decided by the weight.
1,A list of questions is what it amounts to.,This book might be of value to someone who does not know what they want to do and has not gone beyond getting an idea in their head.
1,plastic cracked - poor quality,I used this once and the plastic cracked the first time we used it. Do not use this unless you are moving light materials - like mulch or soil. Forget about using it for rock.
1,"""Playground"" Wheelbarrow","This purchase was made for a residential home. While our project is larger than average; 10 cubic yards of gravel, 20 cubic yards of soil, and 10 cubic yards of mulch; this wheelbarrow is far short of commercial quality (other than the plastic container). When I moved soil the wheel bar bends when you move it. The front support braces have bent to the shape of the front wheelbarrow container. We were surprized they haven't broken yet! We will not buy replacement brace parts, instead, we will go to local garage shop and have them make new heavier ones. The load balance is not what it should be either for this contractor product. I don't expect this product to last through our spring project; VERY disappointing."
1,Great disappointment,"Opened box and ran hot water through unit as directed. Paid little attention until most of water was in carafe at which time a large amount of water was on counter top. My first thought was that I had not put the unit together properly. After two more attempts, I determined that bottom of unit had leak - poor workmanship."
4,"great movie, needs more special features","I have always loved this movie and was very excited to see it on dvd with an audio commentary from the actors. It is scary although you never see anything. Your imagination does everything for you. It is also much closer to the book than the cheesy 1999 version. I would have like to see more extra features. Maybe interviews with the cast so you can see what they look like now, or something of that nature. But other than that this movie is a must have for Halloween or late night frights. And fairly fun listening to the cast tell stories about making the film."
2,Repugnant acting ruins the spooky atmosphere,"Some of the most irritating and mean-spirited people are gathered in a bona fide haunted house for the benefit of a professor's obsession to find something truly supernatural, and the effect, although occasionally eerie (e.g., the breathing door, the doppler knocks, the cold spot), is in the end, one of major disappointment and sympathy for the house for having to be invaded by such spiteful boors. Julie Harris in particular, as the unstable Eleanor, can bring out the homicidal instinct in a viewer, a death wish for her prudish disposition and her whining self-absorption. Shirley Jackson could have been better served by more appropriate casting. Hill House out-acts any of them."
4,HORROR MOVIES,Vary will made at that time it was made.over all vary good old time horror movie.thay don't make these any more
5,TRULY SCARY,"I ALSO SAW THIS WHEN I WAS YOUNGER, AND IT STILL GIVES ME THE TINGLING DOWN THE SPINE. THIS IS SO MUCH BETTER THAN THE REMAKE. I WOULD DEFINETLY RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO PEOPLE WHO PREFER THE SIMPLE, HORROR CLASSICS TO THE HIGH TECH JUNK THEY HAVE OUT NOW."
2,MEH,"I was waiting for it to be more creepy, but instead it felt short. Good suspense. Scary? The music effects were. I like the new one best, sadly."
5,Simply The Best,"There's probably only one time in my entire youth that my brother and I were in total agreement on something...the day we walked out of the movie theater in Brooklyn in the 60's, after viewing this film. We both were scared out of our socks and thought it was the most frightening movie ever made, challenged perhaps only by the incredible CARNIVAL OF SOULS by Herk Harvey. Either of these would make great Halloween Movie Party Night selections, but I would recommend screening YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN afterward; otherwise you'll never get your guests out from under the couch!"
4,Even good for teens,We liked this movie. My teenagers are usually quick to mock the movies I thought were scary at their age but they got into this one and enjoyed it.
2,Way overrated,"Hell hath no greater fury than this film slighted; the almost unanimous raves are sufficient to compel viewers with the slightest pretension for intelligence to fawn in servile prostration to its supposed greatness, apparently.Granted, The Haunting might have been scary in its time, but to a jaded modern audience it is nothing more than a test of stoic resistance to irritation--truly a pathetic loss considering what a great film it could have been had the execution been a bit more finessed. The technical aspects surely could be excused, but it is the directorial decision that is on trial here.With a whiny protagonist impossible to commiserate, annoyingly repetitious voice-over, contrived and stilted dialogues (did people really talk like that then?) The Haunting is interesting only for its attempt to occasion a refreshing change in the horror genre. As a piece of cinema it is a relative success; as a timeless movie for entertainment, it is an unnecessary failure."
2,Black and White in a Gray World,"Very Good Photography inside a Fancy House. Too old school! The ending is lame and the special effects are non existent. Acting is stiff! Get the 2003 remake. That one is MUCH better, MUCH more lavish and MUCH more ZETA-JONES!BOO!"
3,They've done better covers,"The title track is the only reason to buy this single really. There are two versions of the same mix both better than the one on Achtung Baby. As for the covers, these are perhaps the worst 2 that U2 has ever done especially Fortunate Son. It is hard to accept U2 doing Creedance. If you want U2 doing covers try the Rattle and Hum singles or even the One Single for a great version of Night and Day."
2,An over-rated single.,"It would appear that this single is being grossly over-rated here. Four stars overall? Yes, the different versions of Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses are pretty good, arguably better than the original, but the cover of Fortunate Son is without a doubt U2's worst cover ever. U2 have done some fantastic covers, most notably Dancing Barefoot, but Fortunate Son is a disaster. It sounds promising initially but Bono's vocals are terrible. Personally, I find Paint It Black to be enjoyable to listen to, but objectively, it's not a quality cover either.Only for the collectors."
2,Does not ship well from amazon.,"I had to return this item 3 times before I finally gave up. So this is more of a review of the overall amazon experience on this item. Each and every time I received this, the ballast was broken. The problem is in the way this item is shipped. The bulb, which is very heavy is screwed into the ballast when shipping and has no other support. What that means is that there is a 3 inch space between the bulb and the shade so the normal jarring of shipping wear and tear breaks the ballast because of the lack of support. It was a very frustrating affair to say the least. Amazon handled the returns very well at no cost to me but it was still a hassle to pack and ship this 3 times. You may be better off finding a retail outlet for this item. I saw one at Alsip nursery here in Indiana but it was WAY more expensive that the amazon price. So buyer beware. If you order it, check the ballast real good!"
1,Great light when they arrive intact,I tried to get these shipped but cant seem to get one that is not damaged in shipping.
2,Buy a 150w HPS instead,"I used this light for 9 months before the bulb burnt out with my biggest complaint being it doesn't produce nearly as much light as my sun system 150 hps (8,000 lumens vs. 16,000). Then I went shopping for a new bulb and realized this is where the 150w hps wins hands down. The Feliz 125 CFL (6500k) I found was $40 plus shipping while a new Ultrasun 150 is $15 plus shipping. So for more than twice the price you get half the light. If you're worried about vegging in the red spectrum, don't be. The lumens per watt and cost savings on bulbs more than make up for it."
3,Gimme my 11 minutes back!,"First, I must confess I'm not a Deep Purple fan. However, when I first listened to ""Third moment: Vivace Presto"" on the radio around 1999, I was thrilled. So I got the recording, and I can truly say to you that this DVD has almost ELEVEN MINUTES CUT OFF the First Movement. This completely ruins the continuity of the music, in much the same way as Disney did with ""The Sorcerer's Apprentice"" on Fantasia."
1,dead device- no customer service,"I purchased the Visual-land 1GB MP3/MP4 player in April 2006. I was pleasantly suprised at how easy it was to download music to and used it 3-5 times a week while walking to work. It was very genlty used & never dropped. It was recharged over the weekend, but it appeared that the charges did not last more than 3-4hours. Then on July 7th 2006, it died. I sent an e-mail to VisualLand, Inc.and have not received a reply. To date I have sent 3 e-mails & still no response.I will never purchase another electronic product over the internet and maybe it is not the fault of the internet but of the manufacturer.I would not recommend this product because if something goes wrong they don't appear to support their product."
2,Dimelo Tu,"I ordered this book for the University of Arizona. When i got the book it only had three of the four CD's that were supposed to come with it, which i needed for the class so i had to purchase a whole new book."
5,Granna Reads,"I got my copy of this book right before it was put on the ""banned book"" list while I was in college and taking Children's Literature. I've loved the book and so have both of my daughters. I recently purchased it for my two year old granddaughter, and she loves it as much as both of my daughters and I. It has a sweet story and the pictures are amazing. Garth Williams puts so much expression on the rabbits' faces that you can't help but empathize with them. You can't go wrong with this book."
2,I feel silly too...,"I feel kinda silly for having purchased this item, as do many other reviewers. I can't say that it doesn't work, but it's a lot cheaper than I expected given the positive reviews. I was disappointed, and I even gave one as a gift, unfortunately."
4,wish i would of known about this decades ago,I usually cover my food with paper towels before heating it up in the microwave. I like this because it is so lightweight & easy to clean. I either hand wash or put in the top rack of the dishwasher.
5,Great product and saving from wasteful paper towel usage.,Great product! As a bachelor this is really handy as we tend to forget to go shopping now and then lol. So I find myself without paper towels often. It works very well and drys pretty quickly. No one likes cleaning out a microwave with baked in splatters what a good idea and it's made in the USA!
5,It is great,Bought this to use with my microwave bacon cooker. I use it and the covered vented top offered and there is absolutely no splatter. Cleans easily with hot water and dish soap (Dawn). I recommend this!
4,works better than it looks!,"This is a good product that works really well and especially cleans up easily and dries VERY fast.Here are the pros and cons in my opinion:PROS: lightweight...really fast & easy to clean...very fast drying...fits every kind of bowl or plate...non reactive to food and food safe.CONS: looks ""cheap & flimsy"" (but looks are deceiving, works very well)...occasionally, if bowl is wide across, the cloth will ""sink in"" a little and touch the food (the red dot tabs on the sides need to be a little heavier).CONCLUSION: The only con I can see is that the red tabs around the edge could be a little heavier, but other than that, it works surprisingly well. There is not a day that goes by where I haven't used it. I am even planning on buying one or two more for family members."
5,Great!,I have been using this splatter screen for years. I have not been able to find where to replace it until today and I was really pleased to find it! Thank goodness for the Internet and search engines! I would recommend it to everyone. Cannot imagine why someone would not find it wonderfully helpful! Saves on paper towels and washes up easily.
2,I feel stupid for having bought it.,"Before I bought this, I read someone's comment that essentially said this product was a rip-off, because you could just make it yourself so much cheaper. I dismissed the complaint as some cheapskate who probably wore a garbage sack for a raincoat.Then I received and opened the item and realized what a joke this is. It is literally nothing more than a small square of flimsy cheese-cloth with six ""bedazzler"" jewels from a craft store super-glued around the edges. I don't know how this could be enough weight to protect anything since a light puff of steam could probably send it flying across the room.It's not the dumbest idea ever, but I feel awfully dumb for having paid actual money for it. You'd do just as well to put a paper towel or napkin over it."
4,oldie but goodie,i watched this years ago and for a old film it still is a good one would recommend this film for anybody that like this type of movie
1,Numbers on keypad get stuck and battery life shortened significantly after 1 year,"After about one year, I experienced several problems with this phone:- The numbers in the dialing keypad get stuck and I had to redial phone numbers several times.- Several times phone calls get dropped sporadically.- The battery life was shortened significantly. I can no longer stay on this phone for more than 30 min because the phone call would get dropped.I am stuck with this phone which I rarely use due to the issues mentioned above."
5,Highly Recommended For Beginners,"It has a good spin time of about 15 seconds. Plus it makes a good spinning sound.I love the auto return feature. It takes about two+ hours of practice to fully master the ""correct"" way to throw a yoyo (inward arm curl) before you learn how to make it sleep."
5,Great Dad and Daughter Book,"My daughter and I have enjoyed reading Green Bear for over 9 years. When she was just a little child we had so much fun diving into the pictures, now even when she's 10 years old we go back and visit the book and remember the quality time. If you don't have the book you need to get it. The word ""Snip"" will bring smiles and laughs for years to come."
4,I LOVE BEING A DISSENTER --,ARACHNID was pure entertainment and never claimed to be any thing else.Giant spiders? ya'll should meet them. See how far you run.Silly gal looking for her brother. Most plausible.Natives did a good job. Just enough skin not to be obnoxious.I liked Chris Potter [only reason I bought it] after seeing him in a Harlequin Romance movie - excellent acting there.Enjoyed the idiots getting killed off. Some gorgeous scenary - chuckle action - nasty gorge -- all in all pretty decent entertainment. <g>Seeing is believing -
1,Jan!!! You need To Quit It,"I'm a huge fan of Marvin Gaye and his music. But...i was dissapointed by the way they Try to down David Ritz..David had did a excellent job on Marvin's biography. He had captured the very last years of his life. i continued to read this book for 18 years now, and i'm still learning from it... ..This book by Marvin and David is like music bible. it is so detailed, more i can say about this B.S. DVD!!!!"
1,old man ted,"Dont get fooled, this is an older Ted trying to cash in! The sound is pretty good but its a concert recorded 2001,2002 with clipps of his rambleings thrown in. Nothing that would be watched a second time!! decription of this dvd is different than what it actuality is.At times it does get boring listening to him brag about how great he is. Also the first dvd is very short! Why two dvds! How about putting out something from your time Ted, like from the 70s or early 80s dumbass!"
5,Best Baby Lotion!,"Penaten is a great baby lotion. It smells really good, but not too strong. It is not too oily and my daugther's skin is never dry. I grew up with Penaten and I still love it."
5,Great idea,"Heard about this book from a friend. I think it's a great idea what they have done. I'm a slow reader, since I subvocalise, but reading this book helps a lot, by getting me to continue reading, and get the bigger picture of the story."
5,No more wiggly toilet seat!,Replaced the toilet and no matter how I tightened the bolts the would very quickly loosen and the damned seat would shift. Was told about these bay Lowes employee (whoever you were- thank you!!!) and found them on Amazon. Quick & painless to install and haven't looked back since. The seat stays rock solid just like it should.
5,Johnny Depp IS HOT!...oh and if you like romance,"If you like Romance, I advise you to buy this movie. I mean, sure, his character is quirky...Johnny Depp acts very well in this..he's good at quirky!...And he's hot! I'm sorry but when it comes to romance and quirky, Johnny Depp rules....In fact, I'm buying this myself!...Buy it!"
3,watch it with your man/woman (it's even better),"Aside from really liking Johnny Depp who plays the perfect romantic, this movie is adorable, filled with love, humour, poetic dreaminess and dramatic flair. Don Juan DeMarco shows the doctor how to stay young and passionate at heart, though a little bit corny. If you watch this by yourself, you will be sorely missing your significant other (or wanting one). And you may wonder if the genre is romance or comedy - at Blockbuster it's a comedy."
4,Look Depp into His Eyes... and Melt,"Back in 1994 no one called it guyliner, but Johnny Depp wears it well as a delusional seducer (one of his early soul-melting lothario roles) admitted to a Queens mental hospital. It's great fun to watch him play against the massive talent of Marlon Brando's psychiatrist. And then there's that Bryan Adams song..."
2,Trashy film with lovable Brando,"The film was utter nonsense and the worst part about it was Johnny Depp! It is extremely unlikely that he could have any effect on women whatsoever. Every time he appeared on the screen I wanted to skip the scene. Marlon Brando, as fat as he was, would have been a more convincing Don Juan! To be honest, I'm a huge Brando fan and I think, even with his handsome looks gone, he has such a magical aura around him that you can feel it coming from the screen. Doesn't matter how unattractive Brando is in this movie, he is the most lovable character in it and the only reason I give the film 2 stars."
5,Updated Version of a Beautiful Book,I bought a copy of this book in 1978 and love it--both the poem and the artwork. I discovered the artwork had been expanded in 2001 (although the format was reduced) and wanted that copy also. Beautiful book!
5,Simply beautiful...,"This particular poem is my favorite Robert Frost poem, and is one of my top five favorite poems. I was hoping that this book would portray the simple beauty and nuances of this poem, to read to my granddaughter. It more than met my expectations. Even my husband, who is a photographer and who doesn't read as much as I do, found the artwork in this book to convey beautifully the words of Frost's poem.This poem was not intended for children, and has many facets to it. But good poetry must be taught and appreciated early, and this book will help parents and teachers to show appreciation for poetry. If it doesn't start with the parents and teachers, then the children are never exposed to it.Whenever I read this poem, and now this book, it conveys a sense of peace, a sense of being quiet, of learning to look for the beauty in the world around you. This should be a classic.Karen Sadler"
4,Buy used and get the larger edition....,"I think it's wonderful to have this poem illustrated in a format that makes it more appealing to children. I think it's wonderful to introduce children to poetry, and I have read this to my three older children in the 4-7 1/2 year old range, and they enjoyed it. I wish there were more poems presented in this children's book format.The illustrations in the large-scale (8.5 x 11) version are crisp and enchanting. Something is lost by shrinking it down to the 8x7 format. I plan to give this book to my nieces and nephews, but I will look on the used market for the larger-scale version. That version I would give a 5-star."
1,Don't waste your money on a cheap rock polisher,"We bought this for Christmas for my son. Before it could finish one set of rocks, it broke. Made this horrible gear-sliding sound. We sent it back and Discovery sent us a new one that wasn't gyroscopic. Apparently they didn't sell it anymore. The 2nd one was just a normal tumbler. And while it did finish polishing the rocks, it leaked a little. But at least it finished!If you want to start a new hobby, take my advice, buy a ""real"" tumbler, not a toy one. If you just want to try it, go ahead and get a ""children's version.""This one was a failure..."
2,A Major Dissapointment,Ray Bradbury has never been lucky at the movies. Read his science fiction classic instead of watching this dull adaptation.
1,A Cheap Imitation,"Save your money! This movie lacks Bradbury's fast-moving style. The movie drags by, due to such unnecessary additions as the narrator swimming naked and the ""relationship"" between the illustrated man and the witch. Steiger and Bloom are dimensionless in their portrayal of a variety of characters. I could not empathize with the characters as I had done with the book. I believe in literary license, but Smight's should be revoked!"
3,.,"This is an interesting movie. Rod Steiger is well cast as the carnival worker who gets ""illustrated"" by a mysterious women. She had been to the past, she had been to the future and she put it all on him."
2,"Too slippery, getting holes after 3-4 uses","Even after wiping down the mat, it is hard to work on because it is so slippery. After 3-4 classes, the mat is wearing down and has holes in places. I got this as a gift and will be upgrading to a higher quality mat as I am an advanced yogi."
1,"I laughed till I tried to sleep, but couldn't stop laughing!","I'm laughing now because the maximum amount of words that I can use to describe what obvious absurdity this movie was, is a 1,000. I won't give whoever was a part of this joke of a movie the satifaction, except if you want a clean, fun, laughable night of what happens when actors (I almost said good actors) sell out to this dribble. I would love to know how much Rutger Hauer made on this movie. I really wanted to keep Rutger Hauer out of this, but he keeps failing me, as I try to still believe that he can actually act; beyond Blade Runner and The Hitcher, (he is getting bigger though). I'm starting to go back on me not writing more than I said I would, but now I can't help it. Thinking about this movie and writing this review is making me laugh again. Thanks to all who put this ludicrous flick together. If their is a part two to this movie - oh no - I'm starting to laugh... again..."
4,Looks good and the material is good but heavy,"One beautiful watch that draw a lot attentions. The material is durable but the chrome finish show scratches clearly. It's kind of heavy compare to my other watches so take some time to get use to it. It's precise in keeping time and visible in the night. For that price, it's a good value for that money."
1,liberal prescription,"This book is no help in understanding the misuse of political institutions in the U.S. It has absolutely no focus, meandering from essay to essay with no apparent methodological fraework. The various essays seem to be readily accessible virtually anywhere else in the literature. The editors do not demonstrate a sense of historical analysis, the power of corporate economic interests in shaping the political system,, nor an understanding of the efforts of the upper class to use politics as a means of advancing their interests. Even if one were to accept the reformist notions proffered here, the writers do not present how reforming the American political system will work. The prescriptive nature provided by the authors does not shed light on radical alternatives. The editors succeeding in advancing a right-wing political and economic agenda by offering hope where none exists."
5,An excellent soundtrack,Leonard Rosenman found a perfect theme for Charlton & son Fraser's bold undertaking of presenting the Bible in the unique way that they have. From the stirring Main Title to the Resurrection of Christ the music gives a musical account of the stories from the most influential book of all time.I highly recommend it to anyone who loves brilliant soundtrack music.
3,such an old way of putting things,"I was able to find many ideas that were meaningful to me in this book. My current political outlook has been influenced in many ways by reflecting upon:Liberty, equality, fraternity, vasectomy.Fourier had some ideas about free love that produced the comment in the Epilogue, ""It would never have occurred to Fourier that there was a contradiction between the universal love which binds mankind together and the multifarious individual loves."" Published by Harvard University Press in 1962, this book set the intellectual stage for revolutions in consciousness that seem to spring up all around our misunderstandings of the comic influences in our lives."
4,Twisted is only the half the Story,"""So many questions, so many conflicting answers."" Twisted is a mind-bending novel of forgetfulness with a plot which well exceeds the title, Twisted. David Robbins based his novel off the motion picture screenplay featuring Ashley Judd, Samuel Jackson, and of course Andy Garcia. This novel features a girl born of a serial killer, who's purpose now is the defense of innocent lives. However, this is only a memory of her life, but when a distant lover is found in the San Francisco Bay, its what she wants to forget which becomes the plot of the story. Overall, I rate this book with 4 stars because of some shady characteristics, and details which might confuse the reader."
5,GARY SUPERSTAR,"At last, this classic Delmer DAVES western comes to life through Warner Archive Collection, as we all expected, in widescreen and gorgeous Technicolor. Forget all the previous european editions in fullscreen and soft colours, and buy this one at once. Gary COOPER has never been so good, as Dr FRAIL, so is the rest of the cast (wonderful Karl MALDEN...)A must for moviebuffs of the 50's !"
5,Excellent Reference,"I learned to ride and show back in the 1970s and show grooming standards have surely changed a lot since then. In the 70s, you wouldn't even think of setting foot on the show grounds with your mane unbraided, and today I see the majority of people showing B and C-rated shows without braiding. That said, you cannot go wrong by following the higher standards of this book. These are tried-and-true grooming standards that will show the judge you care enough to put forth effort into your presentation.And you can't go wrong with Susan Harris either - she is a tried-and-true source who (literaly) wrote the book on horse care, stable management, grooming, and all other things equestrian!"
5,Great Product,The purchaser shipped my item on time and it was in pristine condition. I would definitely recommend or order from this purchaser again.
1,WEAK,"IM A BIG SLIPKNOT FAN,SEEN THEM IN CONCERT. I GOT THIS DVD USED JUST TO SEE IF IT SHOWS THE FACES OF THE TEAM AND MAYBE SOME OTHER COOL STUFF. WHAT A WASTE, IT SUCKS!!! ""BEHIND THE MASK"" IS A TOTAL WASTE OF MONEY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE ANY SLIPKNOT DVD'S,YOU CANT GO WRONG WITH DISASTERPIECES. I LET MY FRIEND BORROW THE DVD, ANOTHER SLIPKNOT FAN, AND I DONT CARE IF HE KEEPS IT AND/OR LOSES IT. IT SUUUUUUUX!"
3,I wanna get lost in your rock and roll.,"This is the second collection of songs from throughout the Neville Brothers' careers. It features songs that apparently weren't considered good enough to be on the first(double CD)Treacherouscollection. Which is not to say that they aren't good songs, because they are. Just not as good as the songs on Volume 1. Fans of the Neville Brothers will dig this CD."
1,no camera case,"The main reason for ordering the accessories package was because it had a camera case. The product arrived without a case. When I called Ace Digital they said I was scheduled for a shipment in a couple of days. When I called over a week later, Ace said they did not have the camera case and did not know when they would have it. It has been weeks now, and still no camera case. I don't even know if I will ever get the case.For me the accessories package was a waste of money. But it is a Christmas gift for someone and with Christmas days away I want to give them their present. But I am very very disappointed and surprised Amazon doesn't have better control over their vendors. Obviously what you see is not what you get. Buyer be warned."
3,Pretty cool unit...,"It's always tough reviewing something after changing over to new software or hardware, or both. But this unit seems to work really well with Mac software, Logic, Garage Band, etc. Little setup time, lots of features. It comes bulked with a mind-blowing stack of demo CDs and software, all pretty much useless trials and CD's trying to get you to buy software, so if you have nothing to run it with you will need something for sure.Issues with the unit? The only thing is I have no idea how to turn it off, I emailed Focusrite' support and they said there was none. So when not in use you will need to unplug the firewire cable, and or the power cable, it's sort of a silly little flaw that can get annoying."
4,Worth buying. This book will help you understand.,This is a good book if you struggle with anger. the book is easy to read though I must admit that the diagrams in the book are hard to follow at times. I liked best the fact that the book made good effort to link the source of your anger to the past or wherever it is coming from. The book took me a step closer to overcoming anger.
1,so bad it hurts,"This is really a bad book ..., I wonder if someone ghost wrote it. It is flat boring and depresing. There is no fun. horrible. I...Moorcock can be the #1 writer of sword n sorcery when he's on, ........ Moorcock usually get me into his writing when describing the baddies and their plots. There is too much simplicity in thsi eries and it is too quickly ended. ..."
5,Great product,"The BagButton is one great product and it does make space bags from plastic bags. BagButton is comming out with there own garbage bag, can't wait to get them."
1,Way overpriced piece of plastic,"Shame on me for believing Larry Storey's review, above. From a quick search on Google, it seems he's one of the founders of the BagButton company.I'm unsurprised his ""purchase of the Bag Button has been a prime example of how an online purchase should be experienced."" since this being the case, he could grab one off the shelf. I am surprised he would write such a review without mentioning the fact.For anyone considering buying this, I suggest the following free, yet equally effective and quicker method:Take one garbage bag, thickness not important and fill with your stuff. Twist the top closed a bit, though not enough to entirely prevent air escaping. Then kneel on the bag to get the air out. When satisfied, twist it some more then tie a knot in it."
4,Cute diaper bag!,Lots of comments on this cute but useful diaper bag. Could maybe use a zipper close rather than just the buckle. Things can fall out if you lean over.
1,Don't buy this bag!!,"Totally not worth the price. After using it for only two weeks the side seems started to split. After several attempts to contact the manfacturer reguarding replacement. They advised I would not only have to pay to have the bag sent to them, but also include a $12 check to cover the shipping of the replacement. All because I did not purchase dircetly from them. Don't by this bag!"
4,White does not equal blue last time I checked,From the photo online I thought the bag would be ivory or white and chocolate brown. When I got it it was ice blue and brown. Still a lovely bag and I decided to keep it anyway but I just wanted to note that the color was not what I expected....
1,Worst Reader I've Ever Heard,"This is a rating of the AUDIOBOOK VERSION ONLY. I've listened to the first 45 minutes and can't take anymore of this reader. I've heard elementary school students read better! Does he even know what punctuation marks are? It seems every sentence, he reads the first 3 or 4 words, stops (as if a period) and starts again as if a new sentence. Most is monotone, and what inflection he does exhibit is in the wrong place!It's so awful I simply can't follow the story line. I liked Saucer and so was very much looking forward to this sequel. I guess this will just have to be one of the ones I actually READ rather than listen to. Darn! (Besides the fact that I wasted money on buying this audiobook version.)"
2,Heavy breathing?,"Okay, two stars for this work isn't really fair... but I just want people to be aware that through most of this disc, you can hear the performer breathing. It's very low-pitch, and always seems to happen during the crescendos of the music. Another reviewer likened it to a 'hum'... I disagree... a constant hum wouldn't bother me at all, but the intermittent gutteral sounds drive me up the wall. Couldn't they have digitally edited that out? As for the music on the disc, it's excellent (5 stars). Call me paranoid, but I find myself focusing on the breathing, and it really jars me. I've found the only time I can listen to this disc is when I'm in my car, and the drone of the road (hey, I drive a Civic) cancels out the breathing noises. Then I love this disc."
5,Dreams like distant Thunder,"I first heard Patti Larkin live back when she toured with the Bitchin Babes. With them she was funny (""Not Bad for a Broad"" cracked me up!) and talented. Then I found this CD at the library, and discovered that he was SO much more.It's the kind of music that is so powerful, so real, so from-the-gut that some days you just HAVE to listen to it. And some days, you just can't, because it cuts too close to the bone. Each phrase is finely etched poetry, each emotion seems taken precisely from your heart at some time in your life.Today I woke up with a tear in my eye and ""I Told him that my Dog Wouldn't Run"" going through my head and admitted that it's time to toss my bootleg library tape and buy the CD."
5,Terrific Album!,This is a terrific album by a singer/songwriter I really admire. Reminds me of my college days! I would highly recommend it!
3,The memory is better than the reality,"I remember this being a great movie when it first came out, but now this creaky old version of High Noon in space is showing signs of rust at the edges. The tech is remarkably dated. The physics is completely wrong and Sean Connery is really just marking time until the golf course bar opens.No real extras to speak of. A very perfunctory release."
3,Wiggles Live,"My daycare kids love the Wiggles but this cd had too much talking and not enough singing, it didn't hold their attention."
3,"They do the job, but....",I bought two packs of these can top covers last month for my 6 year old to use and was ok with them exept for the fact that they are kind of hard to snap on.The drinking hole opening sits up kind of high from the can opening so you end up with some soda floating around the top of your can.They are not spill proof either when you have them closed so don't expect that.But as far as keeping them bug free or fresh in the fridge I would say they're worth the money.
3,good for a cocktail party,"about the only atmosphere i would enjoy this in is at a cocktail party. it is not terrible, just not that great either. Other than the opener its very forgetable.i forced myself to listen to it last night all the way through (in other words not fast-forewarding through tracks) and it showes a great mixing style, (it was recorded w/out the use of comp. programs) he actually dj'd which is rare these days for a cd, so i have to give him props for that.all in all if you like funky jazzy house just for the sake of liking funky jazzy house then you will enjoy this cd. me, i like house that has a message behind it (if you know what i mean) and is more versitile than just house music for 1 function and that is to impress your friends with music that they can't understand."
5,Light and useful,"Bought this item for my husband for travel use. It fits great inside the carry-on luggage. He loves it, so great purchase."
3,very unrealistic,"it is fun but it has many flaus. very unreall you can only have one employee do something. if you want to have your prouduct advertized it wont let you because your prouduct isn't finished. do you know why? because it will never finish,i'v owned it for 3 months and my proudct hasn't been finished."
1,Basically a book about a man who cut carbs and lost weight.,"""My Journey from Fat to Skinny in One Year"" is on the front title of this book, so for anyone to think it's more of a medical/diet book, please don't be mistaken. This book was not written to be a medical book, but more of a story how Jimmy lost weight in one year, using the low carb lifestyle.I don't give the book a one star because it's not something I expected, but because of the nature of the writing. As you will see in many posts, many discuss the ""conceited"" or ""self-righteous"" nature of a book. This is true, but the man is writing about himself, which should a tone of this should be expected from anyone who writes a book about them-self.So, if you're looking for anything more than this, this book probably isn't for you.I just didn't like the book. It didn't keep my interest and I didn't enjoy the nature or the tone of the book.Hope Jimmy continues to maintain and lower his weight overtime."
1,Snore me to death...,"Jimmy Moore has the most obnoxious, self-serving blog. It is full of hype designed to promote this book.I strongly recommend that you spend a few minutes reading his longwinded blogs, and you'll soon realize what this regurgitated book is all about: himself. It truly is a nice story, but not required reading. Save your money and take a pass on this ""inspiring"" business man."
2,Kinda boring,"I like the pietasters, but this disc is kinda boring. The lyrics are really cheesy, and the music is monotonous. Check out some of their other discs, before buying this one."
3,Better Than Willis (That's not saying much),"A return to more soulful ska and less of the stupid howling that marked Willis (which pretty much is awful). I've been a fan since their first album, followed them from Slugtone to Moon to Hellcat, and I just wish they'd come closer to catching the perfection of the first two albums. A definite improvement from the last one, though."
4,Fantastic product but very slow shipping!,You almost cannot find a bow saw that is not made in China now days. This product is very high quality and the exception.Shipping was very slow. Product did not show up until a week after expected delivery date.
2,Hold Up,"Ok, personally I love Ashley Ballard. But, this was the first song I heard by her and when I did, I just thought she sucked. Actually the song she has on the ""center stage"" soundtrack is awesome... and 'It Was You' is really good too... so basically she just made a very very bad choice of a first release. In anycase, this song brings down her ratings... don't hold it against her."
2,Annoying,"I read about this song through recommendations from people who bought Amanda's ""Everybody Doesn't."" I was expecting something decent like Amanda's song but boy, was I wrong. Ashley Ballard sounds like any typical teen singer. Sorry, folks, there's nothing that great about her voice and the song grates on my nerves. In fact, her voice reminds me of that girl from Dream.The lyrics are juvenile (I agree with the reviewer before me). I mean, ""You can be my hottie, hottie; not just anybody body."" Even if you're not looking for anything thought-provoking (oops, this is pop), this is a bad song. Don't waste your time like I did."
1,"Oh yum. British food. Uh, hooray.","Um, there's a reason people order Chinese food, Thai food, Italian food, Mexican food, Greek food, Japanese food, Indian food, and so on... yet you never hear someone excitedly say ""Ohh... let's order British takeout!"". Yeah. British food isn't exactly a delicacy, so why would one want to get a British cook book?As a 'queer' book, this falls flat."
4,Activist talk,"Let me put a reservation on this little review and say that I am particularly interested in those chapters that treat the subject of journalism, while I have only skimmed through the rest of the book. Kofi Buenor Hadjor has for many years practiced journalism in various settings, both as a reporter, as a journalism teacher (Tanzania School of Journalism) and not the least as the editor of New African. His approach to journalism is controversial because it is an activist and liberation approach which he calls 'committed black journalism'. However, this type of journalism must be understood against the political context of the liberation times of Ghana and other African countries from the 1960s and onwards. Towards this backdrop, Hadjor's book represents an interesting and thought-provoking comment on the journalism profession in African contexts. I can recommend the book as a path to understanding the pre-conditions for the emergence of the independent African media."
3,"Wonderful, often-overlooked modern classic- but no DVD?","This multi-faceted film is so rich with texture and characters, so effective in invoking Hollywood of the 1930's; but I'm shocked that Paramount hasn't spruced this up for a DVD release. The film itself gets ""5 stars"" from this avid viewer, while Paramount gets ""1"" for allowing this to languish in a faded, horrible pan 'n scan VHS version.This film deserves more than the ""3 star average"" Paramount bestows on it."
1,Squirrels love it!,This feeder is only squirrel proof in that the feeder holes are protected by metal and they can't chew them.But squirrels have absolutely no trouble getting at the seeds and will empty this feeder out in no time.
5,great book will open your eyes,The book has amazing photos proving all along that the Bible is true. Events did happen as the Bible says
4,Long reach,"This rake certainly helps to get at that pesky top residue on the pond. It reaches out quite far and is and excellent choice for the shoreline task. Remove the extension and you can use it from the boat, but have a plan for where to put the raked up residue when you are not on shore. Overall excellent for the task and well designed. A little pricey, maybe 15% over what I believe it should cost, otherwise excellent product."
4,good design,"This works pretty well. The only problem is that it may lose sticks and rocks when pulling from a longer distance. So if the head was a bit heavier it may be better. But, it works great for weeds which is what it was designed for."
4,Works well,"I haven't used this with the flotation tube attached, so I can't comment on that use. For raking weeds off the bottom, it works well. One exception is lily pads. I think lilies need something with a cutting blade."
4,The Movement Toward You,"A bright new dark star of the indie set is shining and his name is Jett Brando. He is a crooner frontman of his own band which successfully combines the looseness of Pavement's best efforts with the hazy quality of early 90's Shoegaze. This is all filtered through a pure pop package. The songs on this release were recorded a couple of years ago, but they are immune to time since they're from an old school of classic writers such as Cole Porter. It's a melancholy album overall, but with hope somehere deep within. Highlights include: The Center of Gravity(Sink Right Down); Well, Well; Athuna; In The Dead Hot Sun."
1,Really? Album Only?,"I can't write a complete review for this CD, but for the marketing which is a large piece of any product. My child hoped to have a song from this collection, but it's ""album only"". Really? The whole CD comes with just over thirty minutes of music. Six tracks are songs, the other seven orchestral music. And the one song that is popular is ""album only"". So I'm supposed to buy this song for ten bucks. Not likely."
5,The last word on the gift of tongues,"John Sherill has done an amazing job of thoroughly covering this sometimes controversial subject of the gift of speaking in tongues. He's studied it from every possible angle, just academically in the beginning, but in the process he discovered God had a life-changing experience waiting for him! Based on scripture, this work knocks down the blocks and arguments against tongues for today."
5,Good Product,I am actually fairly pleased with the bulb. I have been using it for 2 weeks now and my plants are very dense and bushy. Produces very little heat also.
2,Tedious and Academic,If you are an economist you might find this book readable. If you are not trained in the dismal science you might just find this book to be dismal itself.Far too often the author asserts points and then asks the reader to take his assumptions on faith while he builds up to his grand conculsions. This can serious hamper the lay reader in being able to follow the arguments made. Those with a more in depth understanding of fiscal policy might just find the conclusions themselves to be faulty and un practicle.Written in 1996 this book is already out of date and rapidly becoming more of a hostorical document than a current events book.
3,Not as good as I expected,"I listened the CD once and I didn't put it on again. I am a big fan of Yes and Jon Anderson but I don't know why I have no motivation to listen this CD. Jon Anderson's singing is great, no doubt about it. Maybe I have to try harder to get in the mood the second time. Out of all Jon Anderson's CDs, I still like the ones with Yes and Vangelis."
3,not to shabby,"Jon Anderson is good, but not great on this one. The album does have it's moments, especially the third and fith tracks but i would recommend holding off on this one and waiting for the next great one because Jon still has some good stuff left in him after all these years."
1,listen before leaping,I bought this title based on reviews from this site. What a disappointment!! I love Jon Anderson but what is this?....very very unhappy customer.
2,while these are good you do better getting the best of scooby doo movies set instead,my boys got this one very soon after we got them so we watched this one many times and have enjoyed it. that said you would do better getting the best of the scooby-doo movies on the dvd set and you get these plus many more of the scooby movies.
2,Not So Funny,"I'd never heard of Bruce Cameron before, but the title and the cover made me want to read this book. Some of the reviewers have compared him to Dave Barry.. but I don't think he's as talented or as funny. This book wasn't purposeful so much as it was just a lighthearted look at men and how they are. Some of the chapters were funnier than others... but overall I wasn't impressed. I wasn't expercting a 'serious' book, but even so this didn't live up to expectation. The good thing about the book is that the chapters are independent of one another so you can skip around and read just the ones that interest you most."
3,The Original Soundtrack It Is Not.,"Well, I grew up on the Original Soundtrack to HEY LET'S TWIST, and it included the best of these AND some dynamite blues and jazz cuts that have been deleted for this release. I suppose this is a great CD for hardcore Joey fans, but it was the film and the texture of that period that I cherish, so I came away highly disappointed, thinking that I was getting the original soundtrack released on Roulette way back when."
1,Have to buy a different guide because this one is so bad,"I liked the look of this one in the shop and at a first glance it looked like it would have all the info we needed for our cruise on our sailboat through the Bahamas. We found that some topics were ridculously written about, e.g. Gulf Stream Crossing. We agree that this is an important mention but the advice was completely a no brainer. Real advice like, what to do if your'e caught in a norther in the Gulf Stream might have been useful. We also found the author to be non-chalant when talking about passages and channels. We had a terrible experience because of this, read the North West Channel LIght - we encountered 10 foot chop there! Also, the Whale Cay info is not highlighted enough. This is an extremely dangerous area that you MUST study and know before crossing here. We found much of the info for the islands innaccurate. A complete waste of money! We are now looking to purchase the Yachtsma's Guide instead."
1,I have no idea how to rate this since I never got it.,Waited several weeks before I was told that the item was not available and was on back order until December (I believe). Didn't want to wait.
3,Terrible,I really tried to make this product work but I just couldn't. It was awkward at best and sometimes painful to use. I found that sport tape worked alot better.
2,Slips off,"This strap keeps slipping/moving around when I exercise and sweat. Hence, it doesn't really work because it doesn't stay in place to support my knee! I would recommend it to people who would wear it to just walk around or for very low activity. It's better to buy the knee brace if you will be moving around a lot like exercise at the gym, etc."
3,A compromise for relief during activity,"I was looking for something that was not as bulky as a Cho-Pat or McDavid to wear while cycling, and this fit the bill. I can tell you that the relief isn't as great as the McDavid that I also use, but it's better than nothing at all, and it's not nearly as bulky, so I guess it's a tradeoff. 3-stars = It's okay, but I'd debate wearing this over the McDavid depending on how much my tendonitis is flaring up."
3,Support is moderate to weak,Because of the way this item designed it is difficult to close it on your knee well. you have to hold it tightly with both hands and manage the closing tape while your hands interfering each other. Look for item with metal loop at the end.
5,it does help,This simple strap does help with my knee issue. I can really tell the difference when it is off. It has been durable and stays put.
3,"Works at first, but not a miracle solution","I've been having issues with pain below and by the kneecap, so I've been using this when I run. It does help the pain, but eventually the pain gets bad again and I need to stop. I'm still not able to run farther than 4 miles."
3,Green is different from the picture!!,Product is as ok ..size shld be fine for wide ranges. (Xs to XL)Turns out to be dark green..I dun think they ship it wrongly!! Super misleading
4,Try this before going for surgery,"I'm 33 old and all my life was an avid soccer player. My faith was ending with osteoarthritis after 4 knee surgeries and it's very difficult to me cause always been used to do sport all days.After my 4th surgery I almost lose my expectations of doing exercise again. I've seen the knee straps for along time and always thought it might help me, and it actually does. Using this strap have left me exercise again, not as always but without this I hardly can do some exercise and with it I can play even soccer once a week and go to the gym 2 more times a week.The only thing I give it 4 stars is because it wears out kind of easy, I've been using it 3 times a week for two months and I had to start using one new today cause the other just stop giving me relief."
4,Almost instant relief,"Bought this to relive tendonitis I got backpacking. I was skeptical that such a small thing could help so much. Within hours I felt the pain and discomfort going away. I wore it for a few weeks while working, and even got back to running with no problems.Easy to adjust and not too bulky.One complaint would be the GIANT white MUELLER logo. But Im walking pain free again."
4,Excellent read,"As a mindfulness based psychotherapist, author and teacher, I found the advice in this book to be very helpful. I find that when such good strategies as presented here are combined with mindfulness meditation, which provides a way of of establishing a healthy, non-reactive inner therapeutic space in which difficult emotions, depression, anxiety and trauma can heal. If you would like to couple this sound advice with the healing power of mindfulness, then I also recommend 'The Path of Mindfulness Meditation' available through Amazon."
3,This book is a good one for children stuggling with Math,"Saxon provides a good instrument for learning math if the student is not very good at math. It provides a lot of review and does not shock the student with too much, too fast. The only drawback to Saxon is that the child gifted in Mathematics may soon tire of the repetition that is so vital for the average student. This book may turn on a marginal math student and may turn off a brilliant one. One must also note that this text is a minimum for 7/6 grade. It is not an advanced textbook."
4,Solid Basics,"Saxon Math 76 is a good text for a grade level student. Having formerly been a math teacher, I did a lot of math work with my own children. My son is now in 5th grade and is bored by our district's adopted curriculum (Bridges, which BTW is a horrible thing to do to children. If your district uses it, you ought to start protesting now before it's too late). His teacher gave him this text to work on outside the classroom in addition to his classwork. Unfortunately, it's been nothing but busy work for him. At no point has it been challenging and it is mind-numbingly repetitive for the advanced student. I tend to agree with Mathgod's review. It would be a good text for the grade level student, but not if you are looking to callenge a child who is ahead of the math game. I would be very happy if our district were to adopt this as their math curriculum."
1,"Useful collection of documents, flawed by serious bias","This would be a useful book, if the author were not so strident in his assertion, implicit in the title, that the native Americans in the middle states are in fact Negroes. My own research and that of others (notably Helen Rountree and Lea Dowd) has demonstrated the veracity of claims of Native American descent among the remnant groups."
4,As deceptive as the film..,"Yawn.. the first thing I say when I hear Paul Oakenfold, but after the film it turned to wow.....This soundtrack manages to capture the underground tech scene perfectly.. With remixed version of Muses amazing ""new born"" and other great tracks like ""The word"" (hmm which film did that inspiration come from?). Without going on about its amazing mixes, general wowness and modern tech feel all Ill say i that it captures the films essence..Whole."
2,Don't beleive the hype!,"Dodgy movie...dodgy soundtrack. So much money has been poured into marketing this movie as a hip, cyber thriller...the idea of commissioning the most commercial and sold out dj in the world only makes perfect sense.The soundtrack sounds like a carefully orchestrated plot by ""Oakey"" to break into film soundtrack work...Probably an idea whispered in his ear by some fat cat Hollywood producers during a schmooze fest.Miss."
3,High Voltage--The Frank Popp Ensemble,"One of my favorite Ciber Type Movies. Music, Guns, Holly, Computers--I'm in heaven. The mystery song (50,000 watts of...), which is not on the Sound Track is High Voltage by The Rank Popp Ensemble. You may find it on the Ride On album."
2,WOW,"I was really excited to get this mp3 player. When it got to my house i couldn't wait to put my songs on it. Alot of people liked it too BUT a couple days later my play button got like jammed which was annoying to me. then maybe a day or two later something became loose in it and when ever you move it that thing shakes around. this is extreamly annoying and i cant even take it out anymore. you might be blaming this on me, but i would barely let my brother touch it. So i would not buy this mp3 player go to some company that people actually know. Visual land??? god id rather have an ipod right now!"
2,It gets worse.,"Horrible riff. The fact that it was written for the movie shows in its poor quality. It sounds like a cliched thing to say, but if you want Metallica then buy anything with Cliff Burton on it. Everything else (yes, including Justice and Black) didn't cut it."
1,total rip off,"I could only get a trickle charge if you can call it that. they said that i did not have enough wind, although it was churning like mad. Sunforce sells misleading products that do not work as intended. They're banking on you taking a long time to install it and going past the return period. Or you get so tired of getting the runaround that you just give up. If you are stupid enough to try one, test it first right away by turning it with a drill to see if you get a charge. make sure that you can get the rotations per minute that you need from the wind. if you can't, don't bother installing it and return it right away before you get ripped off."
3,confused,"All your thoughts are very interesting and helpful if you have a BS in electrical engineering, however, for me I was just confused. Like most Americans, my husband and I want to find realistic alternative energy and have been tossing about the idea of a wind generator for our home to subsidize what we get from our electric company. None of the reviews I read gave me any indication as to whether or not the wind turbines advertised here were worth the price. Come on people, remember some of us have our BS degrees in sciences that do not require a lot of math or calculus."
1,Totally useless!,"The StreetGlow's lightis inadequate for map or book reading. I purchased one, and it was a complete mistake. I assumed that that it would emit enough light to read a map as that is how it was described. It yielded less light than a keychain light."
5,SWITCHING PLACES =),A good moral book. I agree! It talks about how these mouse familys switch places to see how eachother lives and to see what it is like to live like eachother! A GOOD BOOK!
3,"Jan Bret's Town Mouse, Country Mouse",It is not a bad story.I prefer the one from my childhood.the illustration was great.
1,Chicago Gangster Costume needed to be returned,"Costume arrived with an unsewn seam in the crotch. Appears to have been a quality defect from the factory. Returned to Costume Craze at my expense. Apparently because of the halloween rush, lots of returns and my refund continues to be delayed. I should have purchased a costume locally. Several weeks waiting, still without my refund processed is unacceptable."
2,On and on it goes where it stops is boring.,"Nobody buys that Jack Nicholson is some sexy god beyond aging ok? He definately is a cool guy,but come on sexy?!? Gimmme a break. Keaton comes off as some self righteous kook, and this movie is about 45 minutes to long. Not to mention that her plays seemed trite and trivial,a playwrite genius? I thought that overall there were a few funny moments, but this film is just to pretentious to be valid."
5,You'll find yourself laughing through the whole movie!,"This movie was just fantastic. Every scene was yet another funny one. The story itself was hilarious, and to top it off, two amazing actors, Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson, really make the movie worth buying and having it in the house to watch every saturday night!"
4,It's pretend!!!!,"In this day and age of beautiful people, it was refreshing to see two &quot;older&quot; folks enjoying life. This film gave me hope that even the most ego ridden males can come down, put things in perspective and figure out there is more to life than sex and money. I spose, that goes for women too."
3,Funny yet longwinded,"Something's Gotta Give was not exactly what I expected from watching the movie trailer. I expected a movie to just knock my socks off especially since Jack Nicholson of all people was one of the leading actors. Overall the movie was funny but what kind of woman in her right mind, 50 or not, would pick her daughters ex boyfriend over a handsome doctor that was obviously madly in love with her because of who she was. Could you imagine sleeping with your daughters ex lover, icky! The crying scene seemed to last forever, I remember laying in bed thinking is this movie ever going to end. I don't mean to give this title a bad review just pointing out the obvious. Definately a good movie to watch but I don't reccomend buying it."
2,Movie-goers can&#65533;t handle the truth??,"That's what the writers, directors, producers, etc. of this movie must think. They expect us to actually believe that a leering old coot like Nicholson would hold some sort of appeal to the character who plays Diane Keaton's daughter. I know lots of younger women would have gone out with him, but only those who are interested in his money (& presumably, that's not the reason for Keaton's daughter's attraction to him). Even the attraction of Keanu Reeves's character to Keaton's is unreal. Spare me the diatribe about her being accomplished, intelligent, blah, blah, blah. It just ain't happenin' in real life.It was cliché (in a ""PC"" sort of way), predictable, and preposterous. While it wasn't the worst movie I've ever seen, it was definitely a waste of time."
5,Amusing,Amusing film. Well depicted as always. But for me the reason to watch is the architecture!!LOVE her beach house in every detail and I watch it over and over to soak it in. Well doneto the set designers on that one.Story line a nice change from the usual blockbusters full of weapons!!
2,Tribute to Aging Yuppies,"Yes, Keaton and Nicholson do a great job. But the script has at least 3 cliches per second and everything is predictable, even the food they coose to eat."
4,"Bad decision, Erica!","We all remember Annie Hall, but somehow in the intervening years Diane Keaton has become a very sexy lady. Her goofiness, which seemed just goofy when young, is quite endearing in a 50-something woman. Nicholson is charming but I'm not sure I saw the ""thing"" that made ooddles of women fall for him. Frankly, Erica, I think you made a mistake--as a 50-something myself I'd have gone with the doctor any day!"
4,Surprised how funny this movie is..,"When I saw the cast of this movie I didnt know what to think. I am not into chick flicks, so I took a chance on this one and it is one of my favs. Hilariously funny movie all the way to the end. Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton were terrific together. Who would have ever thought Jack N could play a romantic yet funny role. I highly recommend this movie."
4,Enjoy,Ya gotta love Jack. Sit back and enjoy professional entertainment deliver some laughs. Doesn't happen that much anymore.
1,Jesus!,"After fast-forwarding through about 20 minutes of previews I had no interest in, the flick started. And I was gloriously plunged into a plethora of YOUNG beautiful female bods strutting along to some real live 21st Century ""artists"" and their rap crap! Watched about a minute or two, took it out, saved the case, and threw the disk in the garbage where it belongs. Art is dead. Diane Keaton? Jack Nicholson? What a waste. What did I miss? Over two hours of ""artists"" ""singing"" at significant moments in the movie? I've been that route before. And hated the living hell out of it!"
1,Its a SNOOZER,hey for all you older people out there im not hating on this movie i just think it was a lil slow oh who am i kiddin!this movie is good for helpin u get to sleep.i mean i geuss there cudd have been some funny jokes that i didint understand or no one under 35 cudd understand.Jack nicolson can be rele funny like in ANGER MANAGEMENT but this movie is for old people. its about a older man who dates girls under 30 and he happens to date the daughter of the single old lady who writes poems. the daughter break up with jack bcuz hes too old and her mom needs sum1 and she thinsk they should hook up and they do and you get to see a 57 year old lady copmpletely naked !!! yes evrything shows even though its rated pg 13 all this movie gave me was nightmares from taht nude scene THANK YOU
2,"Guys, stay away!","This is a chick flick through and through. I agree that its lack of intensity make it a movie you could play as a side show in your living room while entertaining friends over popcorn. However, it's way too long and though Amanda Peet's a dish, she needs acting lessons. Jack's the best! . . . this was beneath him. And sorry casting consults, Diane Keating doesn't cut it as a playwright. Oh, and one other thing, I'm done with Ebert & Roeper. This movie did not deserve ""Two Thumbs"" - No way!"
2,snooze years,"a silly and contrived exploitation of the ""Golden Years marketing potential"" of Diane Keaton and Jack Nicholson. Yes, they are smiling all the way to the bank off this hopelessly soporific and pointless film.Boring."
5,Jack and Dianne,"Watched this movie on television, went out the next day, bought this film. It's simply a FUN and wonderful story. Your DVD library needs this one!"
4,Hard for old dog to learn how to trust and love...,"Harry Sanborn (Jack Nicholson) is a 60-year-old businessman that likes to keep his women young as he is about to spend the weekend with Marin (Amanda Peet) at her parents family beach house. The trip to the beach house leads Harry into a new phase of his life as he has a close encounter with death as he has a heart attack. This phase opens doors to a new world for Harry as he discovers what he has been missing in his life, yet he is an old dog that has a hard time conforming to his new ideals. Something's Gotta Give is an amusing film with serious undertones of love, trust, and age that is well-balanced by Meyers."
2,Drivel,"""Something's Gotta Give"" is a much over hyped film that plays on the marketability of its two main stars, Jack Nicholson and Dianne Keaton.After watching trailers for this film, I was given the expectation of a witty, clever film. Unfortunately, it is little of the sort. The handful of amusing scenes or lines are in the trailer and the film itself drags slowly to a maudlin conclusion. There are no high points. The film simply encourages the view to keep checking to the time in the hope that a merciful end is close.Both Nicholson and Keaton are better actors than this film allows them to play."
5,Jack at his best!,"This is Jack Nicholson at his best! It is laughter all the way through, but take a kleenex because you'll be laughing so hard,you'll cry!Who'd-a-thunk it with Jack Nicholson and Diane Keaton?! They make quite an interesting but uneasy pair in this romantic comedy. Two people thrown together by the ""good grace of a heart attack"" and the story just rolls! You won't want to miss it!"
3,Dangerous Melbourne,"About-forty white South-African-turned-Australian kills everyone he wants in Melbourne with a very similar batch of neo-Nazi mates inclined into S&M; - and all these his accomplishers before leaving Australia on a private jet to an unknown destination, a multi-million dollar-filled case in hand.This low budget movie is highly recommended for enjoying muscular lads hard f...g gals-dominatrix. Something like Chapters (an Australian TV set) but much more explicitly-embedded from a notion of lacking of elementary moral and sense."
5,Simply a Great CD,"The songs vary from upbeat to soulful, but they always have something to say to the listener. I feel ""Part of Your Own"" is an absolutely beautiful expression of a son's feelings and worth the price of the CD by itself, but not, by any means the only song worth listening to on this outstanding effort. Warm is exactly the right way to describe Gorka's voice as he makes you feel the emotions of the songs he has chosen for this album."
5,Mickey Mouse Roll Call!,"At last, I have it in my clutches! All the music from The Rocky Horror Picture Show. The first disc is the original release of the soundtrack. It has all the limitations of the original release, including missing a couple of songs. The rest of the songs from the movie are included in the ""International"" disc for some reason. If you are creative though, you can piece them back together on the back-up disc you make. I recommend doing this since you will most likely wear out a few discs listening to this soundtrack over & over again! The other two discs are worth checking out for their novelty value, but chances are that you will only listen to them rarely. Oh, and no poster with this product. :("
3,Good but.........,"a bit boring.... I don't know the musicians here. They are very good technically. Empathy, melodies, swing, ballads (good mid-tempo You and the night and the music). But, this is the kind of piano trios that can be boring, I'm sorry for the pianist fans. They have a rather good chemistry but not that much. Sometimes this recording makes me think of the least interesting works by Keith Jarrett. What do they tell ? What do they say ? What's the message? If you like space, wilderness, disorientation, creative urges, skip this one and try other piano trios, like Uri Caine's, Kenny Werner's."
1,Do not watch this movie,"I am a huge Kevin Smith. I love just about everything he has ever created. As such, I was suckered into watching this movie one day when I saw the View Askew stamp on the cover. An important fact: KEVIN SMITH DID NOT WRITE THIS MOVIE. It is not funny in anyway; in fact, it's the complete opposite. It's one of the most disturbing films ever made. It was only allowed to be made because the writer (Bryan Johnson) is a good buddy of Kevin Smith. His skills as a storyteller pale in comparison to virtually anyone else who works for View Askew. Hopefully Johnson will stick to what he does best from now on...selling comics and playing the role of Steve-Dave."
1,Simply Terrible,"As I am often surprised by the clever dialogue and offbeat humor with which Kevin Smith's name is associated, I approached this film with a certain degree of optimism. Though Smith did not take a direct hand in writing or directing, I felt it reasonable to expect something of value. While films such as Mallrats and Clerks found a certain charm in their lack of slick production, Vulgar is without a single redeeming quality. It is poorly written, directed and acted. I can only wonder why Kevin Smith (or anyone for that matter) would want his name associated with this film. Should it ever develop a cult following, it will be a cult of sheer mediocrity."
4,Very Interesting,"My boyfriend and I went to rent this DVD yesterday, after searching in every isle at hollywood video we finally found it in comedy, which I am pretty sure is a mistake lol.Despite the touchiness of the subject I thought this movie was very good. Some of the acting left a lot to be desired (specifically the mother, it didnt help that our copy had the audio a few seconds before the visual.) But the script and direction were both amazing. In my opinion it kind of gave Will/Flappy too much of a hopeless life in the begining. It was almost like Kafka's Metamorphasis or something. But the way everything played out was pretty neat. I especially loved the ending... it was very unexpected and brupt.Despite some of these flaws I do think that if you arent easily offended you should at least see this movie. It's very different.. a nice break from the ordinary. Just don't expect to be seeing a comedy."
4,miss spider book,"I love any of the miss spider books!! They are such great stories...such colorful, beautiful pictures. I love the rhyming in the storeis as well!! These stories definitely keep the kids attention!!:):)"
4,Caution:,"Most excellent, oil painted illustrations and easygoing rhyme! Nice lesson in helping/kindness. Just misses the mark due to off-color (though true) reference to bugs in ""dung""; children pay special interest--please at least spare us the detailed list of ""students"" with dung-related names!"
1,"Awful, pandering, tripe","This movie is so bad, it is pathetic. It is a slap in the face of anyone that has served as a Marine. It is full of stereotypical redneck haters that only a Leftminded out-of-work scriptwriter could dream up. Really terrible continuity, ridiculous fight scenes, silly PTSD flashback foolishness, and a totally unrealistic plot--horribly acted by a puffy 50 year old Kilmer. I mean just wow...it sucked!"
5,Love this version of Phase 10!!,"With this version of Phase 10, there are only 2 skip cards. You can save 1 card per round(which can come in quite handy). After looking at your hand, choose which phase you want to do, even if you did not complete you phase during the previous round. This version seems to go quicker than the original, and is more fun since you don't have to be stuck on the same phase over and over again."
4,Awsome Fun,This game is very intriguing when you first play. As it progresses the challenge becomes greater! The game becomes more intense when you are down to the wire or close to gettting your spread.
3,Mediocre Quality Game,"I've owned the original Phase 10 card game and thought I'd try the Masters Edition. As other reviewers have said the quality of the cards are inferior when compared to the original ones. They are flimsy, very slippery, and difficult to even hold all ten cards because they're so thin. I was suspicious of the low price and I guess the saying ""you get what you pay for"" applies. Fun version but the material of the cards needs improvement."
4,Math History,"An excellent stool for middle school age students. However for the student who is more advance in Math, a more detailed explanations of the equations would have been more useful."
4,Ackerman does it again!,"Although Ackerman's Natural History of Love is by far my favorite book, this latest work comes in at a close second. It is a beautiful, moving exploration/explanation of our need for ""deep play."" Trust me -- four sentences into it, you will reach for your highlighter/pen to mark certain passages/phrases and take notes in the margins. Loved it."
4,Whicked,"This is a really good CD. Loads of good songs.Exene has a great voice and the lyrics areawesome. I cant really explain why, but thesongs sends shivers down my spine. My favouriteis definatley Biggest Memory, it makes me sohappy. I just smile and sing at the top of myvoice."
4,Great Album but...copy cats.,"This album is great with some awesome songs. One of the best songs of the album - ""The Prophecy"" - starts of with an awesome guitar intro, which unfortunately has been ripped off from ""Wings of Destiny"" by Gamma Ray. Gamma Ray released their album Power Plant way before Dragon Slayer and I was only disappointed when I found out that such a great band had copied their music from another great Power Metal band. I can't give them 5 stars for this. Great album but if you really want genuine Power Metal, listen to Fredrik Nordstrom's previous band HammerFall...they are undoubtedly the best Power Metal band."
2,Mediocre,"The jacket states ""The techno-thriller that out Clancys Clancy!"". The ""techno"" content in this book can at best be limited to one page. This guy has a way to go before he can look up to Clancy. Weak."
4,Shades of Simon Gray,"I really enjoyed reading this book because there was never a dull moment. It was also a challenge with the constant change of perspective between each of the four main characters. McDonald kept the suspense high throughout the novel, keeping you guessing until the very last page about what might happen next. Many of the events that took place were closely related to my own life as a teenager, because everyday I face the same problems that each of these four students faced while nearing the end of high school and beginning life on their own. This book is directed toward young adults, but would be an awesome book to read at any age, inspiring the young and the old to find truth within themselves."
3,Bulky radio with bad range,Compared to other motorla two way radios (Eg. 5 miles range) this is a more bulky and heavier version. The 2 extra mile range are difficult to appreciate...Even that in a city where you expect 3 miles at least for this radio...you don't get it even with full battery charge. I know the price is similar to one of 5 miles but the reception is similar and this equipment is bulkier so better buy a 5 miles range. I know the 7 miles range is under optimal conditions...but it seems to be the dessert without mountains of sand....in the city it works up to two miles.
3,A masterpiece?,"I'm not sure if I would call this one a masterpiece. Than again I thought peeping Tom was hilarious. Anyway I watched this movie because it was free and I like supenseful, horror movies. I'm not that into that much gore. So I gave it a shot. It was alright. The musical score was incrediably creepy. That scarred me the most; it's a carnavial theme. I hate clowns!! Anyway the ending was haunting regardless of what some other people say. The daughter to me is the most creepy not because of the disfigurement but of how she walks around the house like a ghost. Anyway it's a short film and it beats boredom."
4,Poetic Horror,"Georges Franju's version of a mad scientist trying to play God tells about a brilliant but controlling and obsessive doctor who is trying to restore the face of his own beloved daughter that was horribly disfigured in a car accident caused by his reckless driving. He requires tissues of recently deceased young women that look like his daughter and he is not going to wait for them to die in an accident - he creates the accidents with help of his loyal secretary/nurse/lover/former patient Louise (Alida Valli of ""The Third Man"") who kidnaps the unsuspecting girls and brings them to the secluded mansion in one of Paris's suburbs where Doctor Génessier is ready to perform the fascinating and horrifying surgeries.""Eyes without a Face"" is a very impressive, classy picture that has inspired many later horror movies. The music by Maurice Jarr adds to the uneasy and creepy atmosphere - it makes you feel like on the never-stopping ominous merry-go-round and you can't get off it."
4,Cool Movie,"A great scary tale from the past, some one should remake this maybe the booth Brothers?Check it out"
1,Hate to say it but... :(,"Hate to say it but, this was wwwaaaayyyy to confusing for me. I'd read the words, but my brain never put the words together. It was just a jumble to me. Sorry for u all, but eeekk!"
2,Funnel Zone,"A very weak compilation. Avoid this one. The only highlights are the early Marilyn Manson tracks, but even those suffer from poor sound quality."
5,Classic Bonsai of Japan,Wow! This is what a Bonsai book should look like! The photos are superb. The story on each tree is very helpful I didn't even mind that they were in the back. I could more of this type of book because the photos were high enough quality to be able to see forms. Anyone interested in seeing quality trees should own this.
4,Mastering Medicare Reimbursement,"This a book that I needed for work, I was really glad to be able to get it on Amazon instead of waiting for 2-3 wks. The information is easily accessed and it is easy to read."
2,General Overview,"The book really wasn't what I was looking for. It was as it stated an overview of the medical billing and reimbursement process. I don't want to give it a bad review but if you're looking for specific software instructions, this is not the book for you. The UB-04 internet guidelines were more helpful to what I needed."
4,Not Completely Honest Compilation but Good for New Entrants,"If you're a new entrant in Nancy Wilson's scenario and want to get an overall view of the important times of her career (Capitol EMI Records), this is the 2-CD pack. However it's not honest to repeat some tracks from other albums which are currently available. First CD is the best one because covers her early times with great musicians and repertoire. The second CD covers R&B and pop hits from the 70s. I would fully recommend you listening to her extraordinary performance on ""Don't Misunderstand"" (arrangement by Don Sebesky) from the second CD besides her old greatest hits on the first CD, like ""Face it Girl, It's Over"" and ""Guess Who I Saw Today""."
5,voice and stylings like no other,"This wonderful Anthology by Ms. Wilson is to say the least ""simply beyond description""No one, absolutely no one, can phrase a song with the style and range that she can.Each Disc bares her trademark range with such simplicity that I swoon everytime I hear her. I have re-introduced Ms. Wilson to my friends who are much younger than I and they have fallen in love with her. We just wish that she toured more often, but understand. Thank you Ms. Wilson for your talent and the wonderful way you sing to all of us and make us all feel our emotions to the nth degree. Like I said, there is no other."
5,Their best album!,"""Hip Hug-Her"" is the best MG's album. ""Soul Limbo"" is their second best. ""Hip Hug-Her"" is where all of the elements of their sound came together to their fullest potential. There's not a bad or weak song. The mix of covers and originals is perfect, as is the mix of up-tempo songs with slower, more atmospheric tunes. Newcomers to the MG's ought to start with ""The Very Best of"" on Rhino. Once that CD grabs you, this is the next step."
1,"Let the dead man die, please","This book definitely has a central idea but I think that Marvin Bell works the far too hard. ""The dead man this"", ""The dead man that"", blah blah blah. My eyes glazed over and I stopped caring about the dead man. To be sure a lot of other people love his work, but I found the constant appearance of the dead man to be painfully repetitive."
3,Force yourself - then enjoy the rest of the trilogy,"Although it was quite a mediocre book on its own, I would recommend reading it in order to more fully appreciate the remaining two books in the trilogy, which I thought were excellent"
4,Murder mystery in space,"One of my favorite sub genres of science fiction is the type where scientists are investigating new forms of life. This book is about an expedition to investigate the life that lives in our own sun.But, to make things more interesting, it is also a murder mystery. There are also strange life forms, political discussions, conspiracies, alien technology, unexpected alien ""super powers"", and characters with multiple personalities. There is even an alien that looks like broccoli. How cool is that?I really liked this book. There was lots of action in between the solving of mysteries and scientific investigations. There's pretty much something for everyone.The thing I'm most excited about is that many of the reviews say that this is the weakest book in the trilogy. I really look forward to reading the other 2 books."
3,They Get Better From Here,"The first book in the Uplift Saga is the weakest of the lot. It's a murder mystery with lots of aliens, essentially. Read it for completeness, but if it isn't your cup of tea, know that ""Startide Rising"" and ""The Uplift War"" are absolutely wonderful! (As are the next three books in the saga....)"
4,Loved it!,"I loved this book for its originality. I liked the characters, and the relationships between humans and ETs. I do think that this book rates a good edit and some consistency help. A glossary wouldn't hurt much either, which the publisher has put in Startide Rising. For those who say you don't need to read this first, I agree, but I think you'll better off if you do. The uplift concept is conveniently explained here, where it isn't in SR. Even when the dialog is at its tackiest (and for SF, it's low in tacky dialog), there is a legitimate reason for it...at least I think so. A fun read. If you're looking for hard SF, you might be disappointed. For a mystery, it's right up there with Scooby Doo. For adventure and interesting relationships with other life forms, this is awesome."
3,"The idea is unique and worth of more attention, but...","Sundiver is book one of the Uplift Saga, in which the galaxy is filled with races who have genetically engineered intelligence into non-sentient beings thus ""uplifting"" them. The uplifted races then must submit to a period of indentured servitude (100,000 years or so) to pay their patron race for their uplift. This process has apparently been going on since the first intelligent race uplifted a client race. The human race however managed to uplift itself, that is, has intelligence without a patron. While humans are not the first ""wolfling"" race, they are generally looked down upon by the galaxy's glitteratti. What follows is intrigue (to some extent) and mystery as some our of Earth's benefactors are in fact trying to diminish humankind. A bit too slow at times and not terribly compelling. Still, the idea is unique and worth of more attention. I plan on reading the next two in the series to see how it goes (there are 5 so far)."
2,"Mediocre writing and long, boring story","I tried to give this book a chance, really I did, because of all the good things I had read about the Uplift War series, but the interminable internal monologues, pointless philosophizing, Star Trek-style menagerie of aliens, and unsympathetic characters put me off for good. Too bad, I had hoped for some excellent sci-fi, but this isn't it. Maybe the rest of the series is gold, but this is a poorly-written and incredibly dull novel that took me months to finish. Not recommended."
4,Book one in a unique trilogy,"I found Sundiver after experiencing Star Tide Rising a year or so before. What struck me most about this book is it's ability to stand alone, as each book in this series is able to do in it's one time and place joined only by the Universe that is set and the all encompassing Library. It's plot is simple, but that is what makes it so enjoyable. What is not simple is the questions that it addresses indirectly. How will Humanity be looked at by Others? What is the place of genetics in our future? Where will it take us? Important questions that more of society needs to recognize are being asked more and more each day."
3,Should be called a 6 piece set.,"These bungee cords appear to be of decent quality, and there's a fair variety -1 24"" cord1 18"" cord2 12"" cords2 6"" cords (thick)2 6"" cords (very thin)Please note these measurements are approximate. The reason I gave this 3 stars is because of the 2 tiny 6"" cords that are so thin, and the hooks so small, that I just KNOW I'm not going to be able to use them for anything. You might as well just use rubber bands! The bungee material on the smallest cords are also not as strong as the others, so I don't think it'd hold anything down very well.For the price it's a decent six piece set, but the 2 throw-ins are completely worthless."
3,Its a Mouse PAD!,"If you need a mouse pad, buy this one. It does what it is suppose to, and nothing else. I mean its a mouse pad."
3,OK,ok for right now type of thing after a month of use it basically start showing wear and tear after 3mos it basically had been needed to be replaced. more stars if was more durable[O:]
2,feels super cheap,"This is just the cheapest mouse pad I've ever seenthe bottom isn't textured or anything, Its basically a piece of foam with thin jersey fabric on top.It works better than using no mouse pad, but definitely wasnt worth 3.50, i dont understand how some people say this is ""The best mouse pad""next time I'm going to an office store.(I have an optical mouse, so i don't know how this works for mechanical mice)"
3,Unoriginal but well told,"Pretty well everything about this movie is standard fare but it is done well enough to make watching it a pleasurable enough experience .All the ingredients you would expect in a submarine movie all are present and correct here.There is the new skipper ,still finding his feet in an operational situation (Casper Van diem);there is the first officer who feels he should have got the job ,a mutinous or potentially mutinous crew and an outside enemy -this time North Korea.The direction by Jon Cassar is tense and tight and the cast do fine in their relatively undemanding rolesThis is a good way of spending 90 or so testosterone fuelled minutes and confirms my view that Van Diem is worthy of more prestigious projects and bigger budgets"
5,Get Inside The Mind of Todays Teens,"Class Dismissed! is easily the best book of poetry I have ever read. It is full of emotion;sadness, relief, fear, and hapiness. It shows how overwhelmed high-schoolers of today are, and the problems they deal with everyday. It brings topics that are often hidden into the light, and discusses them in a blunt and descriptive manner.It is brutally honest, and truly a whorthwhile read.Every parent and teen should read this book."
5,"My ""Bible""",After 15 years I have returned to the Welsh Craft. I kept my original copy of The Way all that time. But only last month did I discover it in the bottom of a box I had packed away. Fantastic. How could a book take on such meaning when I had packed it away as a curiosity seven years ago. Very valuable book.
1,rubbish,that's it - rubbishhe's obviously read a lot about witchcraft etc. but he doesn't know a thing about Wales. He made it all up - some of the reviews who claim to be Welsh can't even get the name Llywelyn right. EVeryone in Wales knows how to spell it. It's just the author writing reviews of his own book - look at it it's all the same style.I read all the words for there implements - in Welsh - I heave never seen so many misspellings.I belong to a group called rhuddlwm@yahoogroups.com and they are easily and successfully exposing the hundreds of lies in these books.sorry - but rubbish
4,Aquatic Weed Eradicator Rake,The rake worked as advertised. Easy to put together and easy to use. One can pull out weeds effortlessly. You can make a lot of friends by sharing you rake with your neighbors.
1,Wow.,"This guy has got to be kidding. He's not a posterchild of faith, he's a posterchild for the loony-bin."
3,"I don't drive, but I got them anyway . . .","I wanted a light glove for warmer weather, but gloves might still be needed. I got the gloves, in Rose, in size 7 according to the sizing chart. When they arrived they felt snug. Also, the color is more of a light brown not a Rose, another disappointment. I followed the instructions to exchange them for a 7.5 and the exchange was handled promptly which is a plus for the company, only the gloves still feel snug even though there is now some room beyond my finger tips. The main trouble is putting them on, not when they are on my hand. I realize that this is because there is absolutely no lining inside the gloves and this makes them difficult to put on. I feel buyers should be aware of this. I will still keep the gloves."
5,"No farting allowed, we are in a windowless void","I remember watching Bad News the first time in the eighties when MTv was still a valid channel and showed videos of merit. Shows like Young Ones and Comic Strip Presents were available only on this channel in the States. I have followed Rik Mayall's career from Kevin Turvey in 1984 to Bottom Live 4 in 2002. Everything in between is worth seeking out.This CD differs from the cassette version with extra cuts, also if you can find the 45 of Bohemian Rhapsody or the Bad News Live Bootleg it is worth it at any price.Brian May should be knighted for his undertaking this fictional yet talented group."
2,Looked Cool. Wasn't.,"This thing just didn't work that well. It looks like the balance would be perfect and it would ""fly"" for more than just a few seconds, but it really just corrects itself almost instantly. It's a pretty boring mobile if you ask me, but hey, I'm not 6 months old so what do I know..."
1,bad protection.,"the case was all broken, and the paper cover was ripped.. looked like they threw in there with no wrapping and just sent it on its way.. bad bad bad."
5,Excellent service,I ordered this the week of Christmas and didn't expect to get it until well after the holiday. I couldn't believe it when I received it in time for Christmas. Service was awesome! The item was just as described. I'm very happy with this Seller.
4,"Ok, see my reason why.........","When I first saw this film, I hated it. After seeing the superior ""Kingpin"", and ""There's Something About Mary"", I decided to give this one a second try, and to be honest I LOVED IT! I don't know what did it, but I laughed until I cried, and only Monty Python can make me laugh like that. I wouldn't recommend this to evryone, but I would recommend it to fans of the movie ""The Jerk"", and all fans of the Farelly Bros. movies. To sum up: NOT for everyone, but GREAT for fans."
4,So stupid its funnny,"Again Jim Carrey makes another comedy movie, but hes really dumb and stupid in it,he makes himself look like an idiot but he doesnt care he just likes to make peaple laugh, and it works.There are alot of scenes that will make u laigh so hard u will fall out your chairs."
1,Not what was described,"It is in english with english subtitles. There is no menu to change that. The description says French or English with english, spanish or french subtitles."
5,"As expected, Classic.","Love the movie to begin with. No issues with DVD, worked as expected. If you haven't yet seen this movie, it's worth the buy. Hilarious!"
5,"If you have a sense of humor, you'll like this one!","I don't particularly like slapstick humor, and I'd heard horrible things about Carrey's ""Ace Venture"" series, so I was pleasantly surprised at how funny this one turned out to be! Some of the humor was a bit coarse, but it wasn't anywhere near as tasteless as, say, ""There's Something About Mary""."
1,GAG ME PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"THIS MOVIE WAS SOOOOOO GAY! IF I EVER SEE IT AGAIN, IT WILL BE TOO SOON!! I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS MOVIE TO MY DOG! I SINCERELY HOPE THAT NOBODY EVER MAKES ANOTHER MOVIE AS RETARDED AS THIS AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!"
3,gift item,"i like the movie, but i bought it as a gift so it wasnt for my pleasure. i do recommend it if you like dumb-funny movie and jim carry as an actor"
5,Best Comedy of All Time!,"This movie cracks me up every time I see it! Jim Carrey plays Lloyd Christmas, a limo driver who has just dropped off his dream woman at the airport to fly to aspen. When she leaves her briefcase at the terminal Lloyd decides to drive all the way to aspen with his buddy Harry Dunn (Jeff Daniels). The rest of the movie follows their adventures as they travel across the United States.Jim Carrey and Jeff Daniels were born for these roles. The script is fantastic. There is never a dull moment or a lull in the hilarity that surrounds these guys lives. Each time I watch this movie I find something new and funny.Don't let the script fool you, this is a very good comedy, in fact, it is my favorite movie of all time! Buy it, you'll be sure to love it!"
4,"Stupid, but funny!","This has got to be one of the dumbest movies made, but it's so funny. I could watch this movie over and over again if I had the time! However, that's me! I've found that the general consensus of people I talk to is that they either love it or they hate it."
4,Really very funny,"Ok, this isn't another Gone With The Wind, its not a total classic, but my god is it funny. Real slapstick sillyness to make you feel good. The two male leads are great, and they keep the pace with lots of laughs. Lauren Holly looks fabulous as the ""love interest"" and plays this excellently. Great van chase, great van, great film"
1,STUPID AND RETARDED!,"If you liked this movie, this describes you. Good thing theymade a sequel, keep your undeveloped brain entertained! I loveJim Carrey, but this movie is too stupid even for him!"
5,YOU SOLD MY DEAD BIRD TO A BLIND KID?,"OK THIS IS REALLY FUNNY. I LIKED ALL THE PARTS IN IT, BUT THIS IS MY FAVORITE, OKAY LISTEN UP:""C'mon , lets go find mary and deliver the briefcase to her. If i knew her any better, she would invite us in for tea and strumpets."" ""okay where does she live,?"" ""I dunno,"" ""Whats her last name, i will look it up,"" ""ahhhhh, you know i dont really recall. .... IT STARTS WITH AN S. sammy, slappy,swammy, swanson? swanson?"" ""Look on the briefcase!"" ""Sampsonite! I knew it started with an S! ""BUY THIS MOVIE"
4,"For Stupid/Funny, this is one of the best!!",The bathroom scene. What else do you have to say? Classic!!
5,Good Advice by Strunk & White courtesy of Amazon,"Help fight the ""rot"" which has invaded our language: Send a copy of ""The Elements of Style"" by William Strunk, Jr. as updated by E. B. White (remember ""Charlotte's Web""?) to anyone you love. Tell them to read its 95 pages once or twice and post a copy of the Table of Contents over their desk. Strike a blow for quality communications!"
2,A disappointment this year,"This 2006 edition is a disappointment compared to the previous two editions. It doesn't look like they put much effort into it this time around. The models are not posed in interesting locations, it is all done in a photo studio so the poses get repetetive - just standing in front of a screen or wall mostly. The music will put you to sleep - it's dainty classical French parlor music. ZZZZzzzzzzz. I suppose they don't have to pay royalties to anyone that way. The models this time around are uglier and heavier for the most part (Julien Arias being a delightful exception). Overall, they are not attractive. There is no music video this time around, either. I hope they put a little more effort into making next year's more interesting. They got very lazy this year."
3,Peu de Dieux,"Good background film for a party. However, I don't think this one is as good as the first or second. The symphony music throughout is a little boring. I think that only two or maybe three brave souls bared all. But all are pretty good looking. The dialogue throughout and interviews make this different to numbers 1 and 2."
4,Good beginner/intermediate book,"I picked up the book when moving to Red Hat 8, which includes Apache 2 by default. My knowledge of web administration is limited to Apache 1.3 and this book does a good job of explaining what has changed which is what I was looking for. The book covers everything you would expect from a beginner Apache book such as installation, configuration, logging and some others that I did not such as PHP, mod_perl and Tomcat. I only use PHP, so I cannot comment on the others. I liked the simple, no-nonsense approach of the author to the topics and you can also tell he knows his stuff.The SSL chapter is the best one I have read on the topic."
3,They FINALLY Made A Decent Vanilla Fudge Album,"It took over three decades but they finally made a Vanilla Fudge album worth the price of the ticket. But even here they managed to make one or two screwups - would it BE a Vanilla Fudge album without screwups? And they were? Easy: 1) Leaving off their version of ""The Windmills of Your Mind"" (originally on their ""Rock and Roll"" album), on which they finally nailed down what they were trying to do with their first (and best selling) album and did it without going so far over the top that they needed a rescue party to retrieve them. And, 2) Including ""Shotgun"" - if there were any justice, Jr. Walker's estate should be able to get them prosecuted for murder for what they did to that song."
3,rivers edge mailbox,We received our mailbox very quickly and we are very hgappy with the quality of the box. The colors are a little disappointing.
5,ABSOLUTLY FABOULUS,THIS MOVIE IS SO GREAT. IT KEPT ME GOING FROM START TO FINISH. I THINK ANYONE WHO GROWED UP GOING TO DISCO'S WILL LOVE IT.BUY TI
4,flashback disco,"If you like disco in the least bit this will be a great buy. There is a good storyline and it lends itself to a good feel. Dancing queens, big break letdowns and young hottie bar tenders give a good idea of how the club of clubs delivered promise to an era. It's a good movie that you can watch with older family members. There's not a great deal of nudity. Think HBO. Not a rated X sex flick, but they do use drugs occasionally."
4,Very Nice,I really liked the movie. The Cast (especially Ryan Phillippe and Neve Campbell) did a wonderful job !!!
4,Loose ends,"True- It' s an interesting movie, but it's more about the club than the characters. It gives an overall idea of what those times were like and what it would be like to live out a fantasy. The story line is somewhat irrelevant, b/c the characters aren' t intertwined nor defined. The major climax is when the club closed, so the plot is sketchy. The music helps to carry it along and it lets you behind the impossible red ropes and you get to stand back to get glimpses of the regulars. If a great movie only needed beautiful people... Maybe. It's still a good cure for late night tv blahs and infomercials and there's always the music."
1,"So sad, REALLY sad","I was looking forward to seeing this film ever since i heard of its being made. Studio 54 is a place that i always held interest in. I very well studied up on it and it's characteristics and i was truly dissapointed at the results of the film. It seemed so chopped up and uneven, that it was allowed no chance to speak, which is exactly what a film of such a subject matter should posses. I was so let down with this film and i would assume it would do the same to others that feel the same ay about such an astonishing place as i do."
1,Disco is Dead.,"If they EVER release this film on widescreen i think i'll keel over and die just like that old lady did on the dancefloor. (which was the only good part of this film). ""54"" lacks style which is an absolute essential if you are making a period piece.. If Spike Lee directed this movie, i think it would have come out so much better. Not only was the acting lousy (did they actually think Mike Myers was oscar material here?), the entire premise of the story was way off base!I did not feel like i was being shown an authentic glipse into the 70's. I felt isolated and unattached to the characters as well.54 is a lost cause. I felt like i witnessed the night disco died. They didn't even showcase half of the songs that made that era what it was! What a crime! Blondie is probably all up in arms over that! 54 had no emotion or feeling and did not live up to the prestige of it's own namesake. Your better off watching Saturday Night Fever AGAIN. Oh well."
4,Grows on you,"The first time I saw this movie I didn't think much about it. Now I've seen it about six times and its actually better every time. The best line - ""Let me get this straight. You want a job. Shouldn't I be taking MY pants off""?I am the same age as Shane in the movie, am from Jersey and moved to the Big Apple, just like him. I did go go discos but never to 54. I wish I had."
3,Batteries Shipped Different from Picture,"Here's what I just got: green 2500 mAh batteries. Here are all the numbers off the packaging:kaardc-4, cat 890 9012UPC CODE: 0 4177890901 0Clearly, they do not match the picture. Don't know how they work as they're a gift.3 star rating simply based on the fact that what was sent is not what is pictured. More a reflection on this particular listing than the product."
4,Difficult,"The pre-filter was very hard to cover the actual filter...I actually ripped a chunk out trying to put it on. After the fight, it works fine."
4,Italian cantata,"Whichever of the three competing versions of Apollo e Dafne you choose you can be assured of great music. This is one of Handel's early works but doesn't show it. The McGegan version benefits from the ever popular Kirkby-Thomas pairing, but the Standage version has tighter orchestral support. The Harnoncourt version on Teldec comes in a poor third, with Teldec not even bothering to include a libretto."
4,Vietnamese love and political triangle,"Michael Caine skillfully portrays Thomas Fowler, an aging British journalist based in Saigon during the French-Indochina conflict in 1952. Caine and his alluring concubine, the bewitching Do Thi Hai Yen are introduced to American medical technician, Brendan Fraser. The three soon become immersed in a love triangle with the conflicting forces vying for control of Vietnam as a backdrop.Caine abhorent of French colonialism is at ideological odds with Fraser who is fervently anti-Communist and is secretly working with factions within the country.The character conflicts ultimately reach a fever pitch, paralleling the strife and turmoil within the country itself. Interestingly the seminal stages of U.S. involvement in the seemingly endless warfare in Southeast Asia is chronicled as the initial pathway to the Vietnam war."
4,Realisms of the times,"""The Quiet American"" accurately desplicts the harsh realisms of 1950's Vietnam. Reporting the news proves harsher. Michael Caine expresses these emotional times in one of his finest roles in his long career, as Thomas Fowler. Though Fowler is married, the love scenes with his Vietmanese mistress are beautiful. As he stands in the middle of the political war, he slowly learns that no one can be trusted. His friendship with Alden Pyle, played by Brendan Fraser, proves this the most true. As the plot builds, the audience's eyes become closer to the movie. The ending will leave everyone breathless."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:The movie's decision to start at the end robs The Quiet American of much of its suspense, but Michael Caine is so good and the story is so interesting that it's not really a big deal; if you like Michael Caine or are interesting in Vietnam, this is a movie to see."
5,A Bete sourcebook for Werewolf: The Apocalypse,"Nuwisha are were-coyotes. They are Tricksters and warriors for Gaia. This sourcebook includes everything needed to create and play a Nuwisha character. History, culture and myth of the Nuwisha, and much expanded information about Nuwisha magic and Totems is included. There are also ready-to play character templates"
3,Better Than The Critics Say!,"I wouldn't call this a great masterpiece,nor would I call Dylan a great actor-but still...Masked & Anonymousis a good movie!It's hard to say exactly what it's really about,as it twists and turns many different ways-touching up on politics and plenty ofhidden metaphors.Bob Dylan plays a character who isn'tmuch different from himself, so it'snot a big leap for him to get intothe role, as Jack Fate; he's an old music legendwho gets out of jail to play a benefit concert.The time period is rather confusing,as we never really find out what yearthis is supposed to take place in.It's like the past, present and future-all rolled into one.The dialogue is often poetic,and things aren't always what they seem.Only true fans of surreal drama will enjoywatching this, and appreciate it.Even the average Dylan fan may have troublewrapping their mind around this rather odd movie.All in all....Masked & Anonymous is an interestingpiece of work!"
1,awful,"Painfully bad. I want my money back.Listen to Bob's albums, but stay far away from this movie. So many great actors, but the story is nonsense. The characters are just a random assortment of stereotypes. Unnatural dialogue. Poorly lit. Poorly directed. Poorly edited.And Bob couldn't act his way out of a paper bag. Stone-faced, frail, semi-catatonic; completely devoid of charisma. It's his vanity project, but he comes off looking ridiculous. Even his musical performances are only so-so.The movie was shot entirely inside a Hollywood studio (except for a few 2nd unit shots of downtown LA), making it look fake and crowded.A case in point: Jeff Bridges and John Goodman. Amazing together in The Big Lebowski. Both appear here as flat, irritating, one-dimensional characters.It's a bummer, man."
1,Don't watch this unless you 'get' Dylan,I don't know much about Bob Dylan but I do know that I did not enjoy this movie one iota. Some movies make their points so subtly that you can't seem them or understand them - maybe this one does but after about an hour I no longer cared. If you enjoy labourious philosophical debate in every conversation you hear you will most certainly enjoy this. I have a feeling that I shall remain happily in ignorance of any hidden depths this movie may have.
1,Lame I'm sorry to say,"Well I like Bob Dylan, maybe even a fan, but I didn't like this. I found quite a few embarrassing attempts to be 'deep', a poor story line, with occasional amusing episodes. To compare books with films, a Tarantula rather than a Chronicles. Certainly not matching his best songs."
2,Conversion problems!,"This product constantly has problems converting the data into a usable pdf format. It is pretty frustrating when your child is using it to turn in homework on which they have worked very hard, then not being able to do the conversion to pdf with any level of confidence. Very disappointed in this product."
3,Good except for Dino's,"This book would be useful for someone wanting a first-glance look into the upper level model collecting. Hopefully, a high end collector will be using many more resources than a single publication however. The relative distain for 308's is apparent but even this is an interesting view into exotic car snobbery. All part of the fun actually. My one consern is the relative timeliness of some of the advice. The exotic car market can swing rapidly depending on market whims. Many of the articles are over eight years old. Still, it gives an overall feeling for what kinds of things can impact value in such rarified air."
3,"errors, but very cute","I'm knitting my first sweater, ""jesse's flames"" from this book and found a ""duh"" mistake in the pattern. I assume that when she says to change to the main color, she really means contrasing color 2, to match the stripe in front with that in back.There are more mistakes, like in the razor's edge poncho lace pattern, which was completely rewritten. There were some problems with her first books, but mostly stuff that can be worked out with a change of a word or two, but most of the corrections in this book are long. fix the errors, and you have a five star book. And check out her website before starting in on any of that patterns."
2,Disappointed,"I found ""Stitch 'n bitch Nation"" to be simplistic and more wordy than informative. I'd expected an intermediate level of instruction and information but feel it was on a beginner level and spent a lot of words just to say that. The patterns were mostly ""fluff"" items - things people make but, imho, most recipients don't really use. While I've read opinions noting the errors, truthfully I'm donating it without working any of the patterns."
3,Stitch n' Bitch Nation,"Most of the instructions are good, but there are mistakes. I am not inspired by the projects, for the most part. I don't have any desire to a poncho (very '70s), fishnet stockings, a mini skirt or a tankini. I already have lots of scarf and hat patterns."
3,"Nice, but not as good as the original","This book is excellent with a lot more fun projects. Some basics-sweaters, hats and gloves, some a little different-rock star dolls and pet toys. All are a lot of fun and a creative take on things like baby pants with a devil tail and gator mittens that you know you probably had as a kid.Some of the patterns are harder than they look and employ techniques like felting that not everyone gets right away.This book also has a wonderful section about making each project your own... and a good section on sweaters and shaping and such that pick up where the last book left off."
2,Disappointed,"This is an excellent motivational book. The book is out of print, so I had ordered a used copy to give as a gift. I was disappointed in the book I received. Its description had been ""like new,"" but it came to me without a dust jacket, with an inscription written in ink in the front, and with green marker on a few pages. The book was to be given as a gift, so having an inscription already written to someone else in the front made that impossible. These things should have been noted in the product description and would have made a difference in my decision to purchase. I probably won't purchase from this company again - and, in fact, it's made me question the wisdom of purchasing used books sight-unseen over the Internet. Be careful."
5,BEST TISSUES ON THE MARKET...,"Kleenex is the only brand of tissues that I buy. They are very soft and do not chafe or irritate one's skin. As they are fairly substantial and resilient, they do not fall apart easily when used while blowing one's nose during a bad cold. They are also quite absorbent, as well as durable, given the inherent fragility of such a product. While other tissues may be cheaper, one would not be as happy with them in the long run as one would be with the Kleenex brand."
3,Good but volume on the episodes is bad,Everything I remember from being a kid. We had to buy these for our daughter to watch in the evenings before bed because the cartoons on TV these days are horrible. She loves them. The problem with this set is the volume. IT can be heard but the volume has to be all the way up.
4,Partly what I needed,"I originally bought this item, with the soft ring included and only cancelled it when I saw the same thing, or what I thought was the same thing for half the price. Unfortunately when it came in, it was only the adapter. My fault, I guess I didn't read the fine print. Ended up paying shipping and then having to go buy the soft ring to go with it. To add salt to the wound, the local RV place had the complete set for $12.99. I spent $20 with shipping and purchasing the soft sewer ring seperate. Haven't used the item yet, but I think it will be perfect for our pop up camper. I rigged the Shower and Sink drain together and will use this to hook to the camp ground sewer."
3,Pretty good.,"The laminating pouches are great. The plastic ""cord"" that attaches them to a bag is bad. They're just bulky and don't tighten to either the pouch or the bag, well. I love the pouches, so it was worth the purchase, but I just opted to use string/ribbon/yarn/etc. to attach them to the bag."
1,Very poor streaming from Amazon,Ordered over a Roku HD device: film started and stopped every two minutes. This was especially annoying here because of theendless rapid dialogue.
1,Ear Bleed,"Purchased this CD on the basis that Dusty in Memphis was one of the greatest albums of all time. That may be true; however, Rhino records doesn't have a clue on how to record a quality CD. The 1999 Rhino version is one of the worst sounding CD's I've ever heard. It lacks music dynamics, is shrill, noisy, and distorted. Don't waste your money on this version. From what I've read, earlier versions such as Phillips is high quality and more enjoyable to listen to. I'm thinking of returning this CD to the seller just for the principle of the thing."
3,Not what I'd expected,"I'm all for some great 60's music. I expected a peach of a record from the reviews here but was disappointed. Somehow the vocals are just too thin, generally, the music isn't as dynamic as I'd hoped. Nice but no cigar. Not sure if I'll ever play it a second time. I remember being in my 10 to 15 year old years and hearing her and thought maybe it'd still be great. Nope. Least not to these 57 year old ears. Oh well."
5,Sweet lass,"Put on this album and you'll hear the sweet tones normally reserved for morning bedroom chatter. Dusty's voice glides through the speakers and makes you want to wear sundresses and overalls, watch the moon rise, and chat with the farmers after dinner. Every time I listen to this album, I feel like I'm waking up in the countryside in de arms of a lover. There is just something ecstatic about this album. *__* Dusty sounds like sugar, honey, Werther's Original, brandy, and a flock of songbirds. Okay, that's dramatic. But listen to the first track and you'll want to fall in love. Compared to her ultimate anthem of loneliness (""I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself""), this album is a slow explosion of seduction and confidence. You wanna listen to every word she says. Whew. Get the 1999 edition from Rhino -- it has about another dozen tracks to extend your stay in Dusty's faux-Southern paradise for days. Peace y'all! ⊂(&#12539;(&#12455;)&#12539;)⊃"
1,Extreme sibilance,"I would not recommend this pressing from '4 Men With Beards'. Sound quality is bad an there is extreme sibilance.Find another pressing, as the songs are worth having!"
5,VERY VERY GOOD!,Mostly a lot of good songs. Never knew she was this good.Buy it and you will love it as much as I do.
1,Buy with caution,I purchased one which worked fine for about 6 months. Of course their warranty is only 90 days! Now it is not recognized on the network. Several emails to Keyspan customer support have gotten NO RESPONSE. Also had frequent problems with it connecting properly to a printer when I sent a print job to it through this server.
3,Limited to 110 Volts,"The USB hub is a great, easy to use device, with only one drawback.The power adapter is for 110-120 volts only.These days pretty much everything comes with a universal adapter to handle everything from 100-240 volts, but unfortunately not the Keyspan USB Server.It would be extremely helpful if in the product description it indicated that the device has this voltage limitation.Otherwise it is a great device."
2,Not worth it.,"I thought this device would be the answer I was looking for, allowing my wife's computer and my laptop to print to the same printer. I've had it for almost a year and as far as printing goes, it has never worked from my wife's desktop (XPSP2) and only works sometimes (rarely w/out a reboot) from my laptop (XPSP1.) I can only get three ports to show up, but it does work just fine with the other devices (a memory card reader and a thumb drive). Tech support has been no help the one or two times I've actually been able to get them on the phone. My advice, save your money and buy a Network Attached Storage Drive with built in print server."
3,"Olongapo, Barrio, and Subic","This is a novel written by an honest, hard-working seaman, who undoubtedly decided to leave out some of the nastier parts associated with our occupation of The Philippines. All in all, it's a well-written novel and it takes you back to how things were. I visited Olongapo 5 years after the Base closed down, and walking down Magsaysay, I saw the Subic that used to be in the form of ancient ruins. Many of the buildings, bars and discotheques long abandoned. This novel let's you relive the sights sounds and smells of the ""Old Sailor Town"". I only reccomend this book to people who have been there."
3,Not bad at all,"I have seen a lot of bad horror movies but I really liked this one. Of course, you had to suspend belief quite a bit but I felt some true scares and some of the deaths were innovative. Same old ending set up for a sequel though. Give it a try...you could do worse."
1,Defies Belief!,"I thought the original Boogeyman film was suspenseful, well paced and really scary. This 'sequel' is total drivel. It's not even a sequel in the true sense of the word - the only similarity to the original is the title and is nothing more than yet another pathetically bad 'Scream' clone! There should be some trade description law prohibiting vague and tenuous cash-ins on original titles!"
4,Are you afraid of the Boogeyman?,"Good movie for all of those who have feared the BOOGEYMAN at some point in their lives. It was interesting to see Tobin Bell in a Non-Saw movie. He is great as the doctor who runs a clinic where people are made to face their worst fears in order to overcome them. Runs well and has a ""never saw it coming"" ending. A bit gory at times but not overly bad. I have not seem any others in the series so I can't compare them to each other."
3,Boogeyman 2,"Boogeyman 2 starts off with a girl at her birthday who witnesses her parents murdered by an unknown force known as the boogeyman. She is sent to a hospital that is run by Tobin Bell of Saw fame. It's kinda like Nightmare on Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors minus the dreaming part or the big budget. Most of the kills are creative and gory, the boogeyman looks like a guy who fronts a metal band or the creeper from Jeepers Creepers. It was a good movie for what it was. I'd recomemnd this even if your like me and have not seen the first in the series."
5,excellent,"This book deals with the perennial question of whether man's true nature is good or evil. This book says they are opposite faces of the same coin. Thus, people have both good and evil tendencies. Only one's self-control, or the lack of it, against eternal sins makes one or the other to prevail.<P"
1,New Age Hot Air,"Give me a break. This book is so simple and so obvious to the point of being insulting to the reader. Layer on top of that the fact that is not well written. Another ""inspirational"" book not worth the cost of admission. Take a long walk or meditate for five minutes, you'll get more out of those experiences than you will from spending your time and money on this."
1,Nothing Special,"Nothing special in this or his other book. I have been trapshooting for a couple of years and really didnt find anything in either of the authors books that I haven't already learned just from shooting or other books that are out there. I looked on the ATA website to see the authors averages but could not find a listing for him so it kind of makes me wonder just how much actual experience the author has. To me that is important as there are a lot of opinions from the author in the book that are hopefully backed by experience and not just someones own personal theories. I would recommend spending your money getting lessons/books from an accomplished, well known shooter rather than on this book."
4,More breaks!,"Outstanding book! While reading I recognised several things I was doing that was causing lost targets. The sections on concentration techniques and target aquisition have definitely helped my game, and by following his advice, my handicap average jumped from 21 at the 16 to 24, and from 19 at the 25 to 22. His practice tips for both home and field, if followed, will help anyone improve thier game. The guys at the range asked me how I made the jump, and well, I'm not telling them!"
2,Boring,"I purchased this book, and it has some information that was helpful, but not a lot. My biggest complaint is that all the illustrations are in the back of the book, so you have to keep flipping back and forth."
1,Plodding...This is no Glass Lake,"Typically, Maeve Binchy unravels her characters lives in such a way that the reader is practically forced to enter the story. With this sad collection of short stories centered around the many facets of travel, the frequent Binchy reader may well be disappointed. It is hard to ""feel"" a character in a 6-7 page story, though some writers have the gift that allows this to happen. Unfortunately, Maeve fails at this feat and I find myself finishing the book simply on principal. Binchy fans should stick to her old standbys like Glass Lake, Firefly Summer and Circle of Friends."
4,Slices of life,"These slices of life are real, easily read, and poignant. I saw myself in some, saw friends in others, and just enjoyed the rest. Quick reading, fun, and real."
3,Surprize,"The product was as adverised. In good condition amd arrived in good time.I only wish it had been called a book of ""short stories"". I generallydo not buy short stories and probably would not have purchased this oneif I had known."
2,Doesn't work too well,"Out of 20 pictures I took using this diffuser, may be only about 4 turn out with the zoom effect shown. The rest of the pictures are all blurry. This filter doesn't work in the day at all, only work at night when there is spotted light source in the surrounding area and sometime this filter will shown a fresnel lens effect on picture ( Having a lot of concentration ring equally space between each other)."
5,Very helpful for getting started,I've started reading it and I believe it was a worthwhile purchase.
1,Dull and pointless,"This film is excruciatingly dull and pointless. It seems to be about the French Foreign Legion, and an officer's obsession with a young recruit. That's about it."
5,This is one of my All Time Favorites!,"This is such a re-watchable movie, and one of my all time favorites. The Turner Classic Movies channel has been showing a nice widescreen transfer of this film, and there is an MGM logo at the end of it. So MGM studios, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE release TerrorVision (1986) on DVD in 16 by 9 widescreen, maybe as part of your ""Midnite Movies"" series. All of the many fans of this movie will be very grateful."
3,A Little Cheese Goes A Long Way,This movie is honestly of the best 80's cheese horror/comedic films of all time. Where else could you get Medusa and A big mess that comes out of the TV to kill you? LOve It Love It
2,Does not hold up,"I purchased this item in April, put it on a pole and by October much of the paint was coming off the sides and roof of the house. It was in a spot that got maybe 4-5 hours of sun. Almost seems that they painted it with interior and not exterior paint. If you buy this you might want to put another coat on it otherwise it will come off."
2,disappointed,"As others have mentioned, the print is much too small. There was no need to do this, as the book only measures 5 1/2 by 6 1/2 inches.What is more upsetting, however, is (so far) everything I've looked up in the index gives the wrong page number. Since the book isn't alphabetized, and I have no desire to spend hours browsing through it in search of what I'm trying to find, the book is next to useless for me. Don't waste your money."
4,Awesome Collection of ASU,"All Star United has done it again. Although it is not a release of new material, it brings the old hits back to life for another go-around in CD players. This should be good enough to hold people over until an album with new songs come out. If you like this, I suggest their self-titled first album and ""International Anthems for the Human Race."" God bless!"
3,Mediocre historical work,"The book does a so-so job of detailing President Johnson's War on Poverty, especially in regards to administration and how little rhetoric matched reality. Not anything special or great, but a decent history on the topic in everyday language, not scholarly prose."
2,Not quite the real Ludlum,"While this book was entertaining, using Ludlum's name to sell it does not do Ludlum justice.The storyline and political backpedaling are well developed. However, the author does not do a very good job of keeping the reader in suspense. I believe an eight grader could correctly guess what is going to happen next.I believe Jon Smith's character is a real stretch. The combination of being a top level biological scientist and a James Bond type agent doesn't make sense. The first story he was introduced in was believable. This one is not.The author spends way to much time trying to weave suspense into catching a slow moving ship. I cannot believe any government would allow that ship to get very far without being blown out of the water.The sub story regarding Castilla's father really didn't work in this book.Since the ending of this book was telegraphed so early in the novel, there was very little suspense left for the conclusion."
2,Frustration,"It is obvious that the plot and characters are very good. Ludlum was a master of putting a good novel together. The problem comes when another author picks up the outline and tries to create the story from it.At times, the book is very readable and the action moves along, but other times the author decides to try and describe characters you have already been introduced to and seemingly has an inability to create a different description for each, as much of the wording is identical or very close.As others have mentioned, there are times when the author seems to have difficulty writing a particular passage and the words come out a bit jumbled. I would have expected a proof-reader or editor to catch some of these snags.If you can ignore stinted and misplaced descriptions along with poorly phrased sections, the story the author is trying to craft can be quite decent."
2,A Poor Work for the Ludlum Name!,"This will be short. The shortcomings of this book are previously mantioned-if you love Tom Clancy but hate 'his' ""Op-Center"" series, you'll know just how Ludlum's name is being used in this series. Just like Clancy's name shouldn't be on the Op-Center books, Ludlum's name has no place on this one. If you're looking for Ludlum, buy one he wrote."
5,Fantastic!,"This book was wonderful! Timely with its issues, keeps you locked to the page, rich with information and characters - you move through this book at a frenetic pace, devouring page after page until the end - an oh what an ending! From the cover, it looks like this was written by Gayle alone based on the series with Ludlum and to be honest, I think she's outdone the master! This one will keep you turning the pages until well in the morning. Bravo Gayle! On another fantastic read."
2,Torturous,"I stopped reading books written by Robert Ludlum approximately 20 years ago. I found them too complex and intricate for my somewhat simple mind seeking escape from my own complexities and intricacies.When I saw this book, I decided to try it - a new series conceived by the master, but written by a new author. I could understand the plot. My problem with the book is it was not worth the effort expended to do it.To end on a positive note, I finished reading it, so it rates two stars."
2,"Ok, but not Ludlum.","The story is ok and is classic Ludlum but the ghost writing is horrible. Ludlum never dressed his characters in ""bespoke"" suits before. Also lots of errors in choice and use and description of various weapons. Needs to be written by someone who has actually read Ludlums past books. If you are anal for the details you will find the new writer very distracting. If you just read for the story you will be very pleased."
2,Not a 64 minute rock concert,"hi. know this: paul talks for 22 minutes, the notes say. i think it's about 18.5.so, the songs: 13 songs, 64 minute concert, NOT SO!!!!the concert is 39 minutes, all those old 2:50 songs,as Townsend puts it, so the after interview w/ paul,yes, is 24 minutes and has some ok video footage, recollections from the concert songs, but not other stuff.it's a 39 minute concert, w/ some footage at end.it's ok....."
3,Not the best Choice,Well the product was received opened not a good thing. Items could have been missing or damaged lucky for me it was not damaged or any missing items but should be better sealed. Well first off when installing the tonneau cover I found it to be difficult because the instructions were poor at best could have done a better job. I did do some minor damage to the front of the bed rail when installing the clamps so be careful with the clamps take your time harder than it looks in the instructions. Not much room to work with when trying to install the front rail to the clamps on my ford F150. Well as far the the cover itself a little difficult to install but not bad. I can't really recommend the cover because of the instructions and the damage done to my vechile. I had a cover on before this one that I installed my self with no damage to the truck so hope this helps.
3,Early Years,"This is likely a reissue of their debut ""The Magnificent Moodies"" from 1965 with the original lineup, including Denny Laine, Milton Bennett, the now retired Ray Thomas, and sole remaining original member Graeme Edge. There is almost no mention of this period whatsoever on the official site, as most people only know the material with Justin Heyward, John Lodge, and even Patrick Moraz. ""Go Now"" is the standout track, as Laine would continue perfoirming and re-recording it, even with Paul McCartney and Wings, whom he's best known for working with. The sound quality is fair, as it sounds like it was taken from an old LP, maybe even virgin vinyl. For loyal fans only!"
4,Spinner,Purchased this item a couple of seasons ago. It still provides hours of enjoyment watching the inside spinner and outside spinner with the wind. Coat the surface with a car polish if hanging outside. I did not and some rust has appeared at the rivet points. Make sure to hang it one diameter from any obstructions. In a heavy wind it will move this much.
2,"Informative, but lacking direction","I had high hopes for this book. It didn't meet them. For one thing, the book is not broken down into chapters, but consists of two sections with each section having one subsection. This causes a lack of consistency in the presentation of facts. The book seems to wander at times and doesn't really seem to get its point across. Also, there is no index to find information you need.Then, when it comes time to discuss the mystery of Lucifer, there is a breakdown. Some information, such as the pagan origins of Lucifer, which it would seem should be given are only vaguely footnoted with a suggestion of seeking another source for the facts. But they are key to the arguments of the book. All in all, a difficult read. There is a good amount of factual content, though."
4,The Next Karate Kid,Movie was OK but not as good as the first ones. The package arrived and the plastic case was cracked. I had to put it into my own jewel case. Other than that the CD worked just fine.
2,Hillary Swank is grate in this movie.,I think that it a boring so so movie no wonder this movie is barley reconised but I just saw it because I really like Hillary Swank and her peformince in boys dont cry got grate reviews so I figured I would see this first before I waist my money in the theter sinse that is more money. And know I really want to see that movie because her perfomince is grate.
1,"Terrible movie, but I love it","Taken seriously, this movie sucks. The story is forced, the characters are ridiculously over the top, and any scene with the monks is just bad. It's almost painful to watch this movie. Some of the lines are laughable. When Julie (Swank) challenges the bully to fight, she says, ""If I'm ever going to respect myself, I need to do this."" Um, okey dokey. There are several lines which are just as bad. The villain characters are laughably unbelievable, especially Col. Dugan. Why would any school have a team of bullies like the Alpha Elite? Nothing makes sense in this movie. The bowling part with the monks hurts to watch. Swank looks pretty hot at times, manly in others."
3,Isn't Designed for Senior Citizens,"I am new PS3 game player and a senior citizen. While controls for the F1 racer might be realist, they are too sensitive for my motor skills. Plus, the forward view while racing is too limited for my reaction time. Maybe these features are adjustable but I have not found the way change the adjustments."
4,Great Game for F1 Fans,"If you're a F1 fan, this game is great. It's not 100% accurate, but captures many of the F1's particulars - standing starts, pits, fuel strategy, etc. The detail is awesome if you're on HDTV. Driving in the rain you see rain splash and rooster tails."
2,huge dissapointment,"I hear non-stop praising of the graphics capabilities of the ps3, so I finally buy one for the single purpose of driving simulators, as I did with the ps2. since gt5 is yet to be released, I forked out 60$ for f1 ce as I am a huge f1 fan. graphics are amazing, the sound is accurate, the tracks are accurate, but as a simulator, this is the worst game I have ever played. there is at least a .3 second lag between control input (with a logitech dfp wheel and the sixaxis). this makes the cars close to impossible to drive as I am used to both the feel of a real car and the instant response of gran turismo. despite the graphics and getting to drive tracks like monza and suzuka, I find this game miserable to drive, and I end up playing the free gran turismo hd demo instead after getting bored struggling to keep the car on-line. if you want an arcade game, go ahead an buy this, but if you are looking for a realistic simulator, your only choice seems to be gran turismo."
3,Researching Identity?,"This is a very literary book and an entertaining story, but you have to be in the mood. It is saturated with in-jokes. The long biographical bits can be very tedious if you don't like random bits of curious facts. It can easily be seen as pretentious. What grabbed me was that this novel is about the obsessive need to understand and possess another's identity. How much do we need to know to understand someone and what do we do when that understanding is found? Is history fixed or malleable? No answers are possible and this novel concedes to that point. It conveys a deep understanding that all this knowledge that we desperately acquire to know another must be gathered and dropped simultaneously if we are to gain any idea about another person's identity."
2,"Unfortunately, these do not last very long.","These rubber furniture tips are good looking and correctly sized.However, it has only been 2/3 of a year and they are already cracked. I'm using them on patio furniture, but the weather here in California is very mild so they should be OK.I'm disappointed."
1,Wow this sucks Sandisk trys to trick the weak minded again.,"Just as they lable ""PSP Specil memory sticks"" there is no difference just buy a Sandisk or other trusted brand 4 gig 35$ digital camera memory stick pro duo and format it from system settings. THIS IS FOR THE WEAK MINDED THAT ARE TO STUPID TO KNOW THAT ALL MEMORY STICK PRO DUO WORK WITH THE PS3/PSP!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Superficial,"Based upon the ""Three Perfect Days"" series in the United Airlines in-flight magazine, this 30-minute video simply doesn't cut it. Instead of focusing on the more enduring sights of Buenos Aires, it takes the viewer into a never-ending stream of hotels, restaurants and shops, accompanied by a series of slick narrators, presumably added because of their ""sophistication.""And Lauren Hutton? If, like I, you once considered her to be one of the most natural, and beautiful, women in the world, you're going to be disappointed by her performance here. Coiffured in one of those god-awful onion-ring hair-dos popularized by Nicole Kidman, and speaking in an affected manner, she comes across as a first-rate phony. She could at least have learned how to properly pronounce ""Buenos Aires.""Unless you're a masochist, skip this one."
2,Good older movie,"This is a good movie if you like older movies. My husband likes Charles Bronson movies and had been wanting this one for some time. However, this particular one has proved to be defectived with noisy audio and blurred visual in places. We are in contact with seller at present. Will update with results."
5,Geat introduction to paleolithic nutrition,"I gave this book a five star rating because, within its scope, it cannot be significantly improved. I came to this book having already done considerable thinking (and practice) about the subject. And, so, I can say with confidence, that this book easily passes muster. Ray will give you his ten commandments of eating (5 do's and 5 don'ts) which revolve around simple, easily acquired foods. I know that since I have been eating a lot of fresh meat every day I feel much better, both physically and mentally. While recommending this book without hesitation, I do have a nit to pick. Ray says to avoid foods that are acquired through technology. Since any technique is, ipso facto, a form of technology, this is hardly useful or even meaningful advice. Better, in my opinion, that he should recommend avoiding foods that are intrinsically the product of mechanized labor."
5,Finally a rational diet-lifestyle book,"Not just another weight-loss diet guide, NeanderThin presents a rational case for how humankind's digestive genetics have not caught up with the radical changes in diet since the start of the Neolithic era (10-20 thousand years ago). A clear, well-stated argument is made for elimination of modern foods that need to be cooked or processed to be edible, or which couldn't be obtained by a hunter-gatherer on the savanna, 'naked with only a sharp stick.' Well done, and totally workable recommendations without demanding too much in the way of dietary sacrifice or lifestyle change. It works!"
3,Good - but with one error,"A pleasant mix of hits and misses that will, overall, please any fan.Note: there is one manufacturer's defect in the song list. Track #8 is erroneously titled ""Love Me Or Leave Me"" when in fact it is ""Penthouse Serenade (When We're Alone)"""
3,Waits is like good wine,". . . gets better with age. Still some wonderful stuff here. ""I Want You"" is one of his best."
4,Outrageously underrated,"A sadly obscured, yet high quality album. Is there any bad MES album? But, to give people the feel for it, I would say the songs largely resemble that of 'Athlete Cured' from the Frenz Experiment. Slightly more subtle with techno intermixed here and there. But of course the same wonderful MES stream of consciousness vocals. Deserves to be in any fan's collection."
5,very good,"I love this product! The fragant is not too strong, too sweet, but has powerful flower fragant. For those who love natural fragant, I recommend it!"
2,Learn to write,"Hard to read because citations appear in text rather than footnotes or endnotes and it breaks up the reading. Also, making it difficult to read, is less than perfect grammar and questionable sentence and paragraph structure. After you get past all the problems, the information, what's not lost in the read, seems useful."
2,ZZZZzzzzzz......,"Even though no one will probably read this, I feel I have to warn Holmes fans if they find this book and want to read it. I'll put it bluntly, it was very boring. I had to force myself to finish it, mostly because it was due back at the library soon. I have no idea what the author was trying to do writing this book, since it obvisously didn't get much attention. The book is not really a biography, he (Holmes) does not start out saying where he was born, in fact he never goes there but sort of skips to his childhood in the middle of the story to explain why he never talked about his childhood with Watson. Which isn't reason enough to read this book. Some things that annoyed me was the fact that the author tells us that ""the woman"" was actually a famous (or is that infamous?) prostitute; Holmes had never gotten married because the type of women he liked were of ""a certain occupation."" Holmes? Never! All in all a very bad, boring, and not worthy of Sir Author Conan Doyle."
5,Good Movie,"This is a really good movie. It is fun for the whole family. funny, good values and very entertaining. Love it"
4,"Solid, but perhaps too broad","This is a somewhat high level walkthrough of all Linux related security issues, from basic networking and operating system issues, to web server configuration and scripting language security. At about 500 pages that's a tight squeeze, even for O'Reilly. Some of the coverage suffers, specifically I found the security information on PHP to be very scanty given the popularity of the language and how often web applications that use it are fraught with SQL injection vulnerabilities.That being said, the writing is excellent, and the coverage that is there, which is at a reasonable level of depth, is solid. In addition, security is something you have to work at, so having an introduction to get you down the road is probably a good idea anyway. I'd like to see the next version have deeper information on web server security, but in the meantime this is a solid walkthrough of Linux security."
3,Better than The One,"When I saw this movie I thought it was pretty awesome except for when the characters started acting. The action scenes were excellent the best part of the movie is when he makes his way up to the head bad guy in the building at the end. When I saw the trailers for The One I thought it would be totally better then KOD but man was I wrong. The action doesn't start till the end and they were too busy with the special effects. I think Jet Li's biggest mistake was turning down the lead role for Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. If Jet Li doesn't start getting better directors and better scripts, he's going to end up like that Jean Claude something."
3,BIG ENDING WORTH THE PRICE,"There's no denying Jet Li's physical charisma. In ""KISS OF THE DRAGON"" (CBS/Fox) he's a Chinese secret agent fighting his way through the entire Parisian Police Bureau after he's double-crossed in a sting operation. Extreme fight sequences and a climax that alone justifies the rental if not the purchase of this disc. Luc Besson co-wrote the screenplay that needs a whole lot less talk and even more action. Bridget Fonda gives her all in a thankless role as an ex-junkie hooker from heartland America. Stars Jet Li and Bridget Fonda join director Chris Nahon in a loose, entertaining and interesting commentary. Additional bonus material includes four featurettes, two storyboards analysis, still galleries and more."
3,It's average,"The fighting is definitly the strength of this film, fast paced and brutal. Li uses everything that he can get his hands on and proceeds to give all the badies a lesson smiteing.But aside from the fighting the film is sort of flat. The plot is very thin and not new. They have a wonderful French actor as the villain [can't remember his name.] But they fail to use his talent. He comes across as the average run-of-the-mill lunatic. There was nothing special about his character at all. That is such a shame as he is so good.Fonda was ok, but her character seemed odd to me for the entire film. Never quite on the same level as the plot wanted her to be.My favourite character was Li's china contact [Kato in the old Pink Panther movies.] He had deapth and good lines.Overall it was an enjoyable film and well worth the watch for the action. Just don't expect too much."
4,Flying fists in France,"Jet Li stars as a Chinese police officer sent to Paris to assist their authorities on breaking up a drug smuggling ring. Upon arrival he quickly finds himself ""set up"" by one very corrupt policeman. Throw in a prostitute with a ""heart of gold"" (Bridget Fonda) and you have all the ingredients, corny though some of them may be, for a terrific action film.With Mr Li doing what he does best, without the aid of Industrial Light and Magic, aided and abbetted by a very sexy Miss Fonda the film is a treat for connoisseurs of the genre. The film is spoilt only by whoever it was decided to cut bits from specific fight scenes, making them appear jerky and slightly disjointed."
3,ONE OF JET LI'S BETTER U.S. FILMS,"A CHINESE COP [JET LI] GETS FRAMED FOR A DRUG OPERATION. AND NOW HE MUST FIND A WAY TO CLEAR HIS NAME. AN OK MOVIE. HAS SOME PRETTY GOOD FIGHT SCENES AND AN OK PLOT. THE ENDING IS PRETTY COOL. BRIDGET FONDA PLAYS AN EX-DRUG ADDICT/HOOKER NAMED JESSICA. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF JET LI, YOU SHOULD LIKE THIS ONE A LOT."
1,Pitiful!,"Going to see this was one of the biggest wastes of my money. I am usually pretty forgiving when it comes to movies, Kiss of The Dragon really demostrated how bad of an actor Jet Li really is (in fact all of the acting in the movie was bad). It proved how much Romeo Must Die (an excellent movie) really depended on good actors (and actresses). The fight scenes were overly violent and made me cringe at times (and i usually don't mind excessive violence). The plot seemed like it was made in a matter of 15 minutes becuase there were so many holes that by the time I left the theater I was angry about wasting my time and my money.I recommend that you save our time and money and leave this one on the shelves"
1,Kiss of the Dragon (Blu-Ray),This is has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen . It ranks up there with Godzilla 2000 ...
4,Pretty woman meets Leon.,"I thought this was a good action movie with a reasonable plot and better than average acting, with a budget probably no bigger than an average Jackie Chan movie. The ending was novel and Jet Li’s use of needles, to supplement his martial arts skills, added a fresh touch.Jet Li looks convincing, with respect to his characterisation. And Bridget Fonda looks good too."
3,Jet li in one of the best fighting movies.,"This movie has a lot of things going for it.screenplay by Luc Besson the guy who directed fifth element and leon.the story is simple but well made,fights are AMAZING and so good.acting is superb, the villen is great and so is jet li here.if you love action films, this one is for you.Jet li is super good in this film, evem his english just makes him sound and look bad ass here.he is brutal in his fights, and there are a lot of fights!fun to watch indeed!"
4,Love Story - Film Noir,"Klaus Menzel's debut as a director is a compelling combination of a Film Noire and a tragic lovestory. ""Fascination"" is more about the consequences of a crime than crime itself. It deals with obesession, distrust and intrigue that change the perfect world of a high society family into a living nightmare. Grand actors like Jaqueline Bisset and Stuart Wilson but also the newcomers Adam Garcia and Alice Evans convince as lead characters in this ""dangerous"" lovestory. The soundtrack contributes perfectly to this exciting and unconventional thriller that made the audience hold their breath until the very end."
5,"Goo see ""Fascination"" - You won't be disappointed!!!","I just saw ""Fascination"" because I liked the DVD cover and had seen pretty much everything else new. Wow! What a film. It's a brilliant thriller that really draws you in and spits you out again. You start thinking it's going to be just a usual film about a man who gets murdered and the people in his life trying to deal with it: then it becomes a murder mystery and then suddenly a really hot love story. I really believe this film should have been shown in theatres and not be on DVD. But the best thing is Adam Garcia, who I discovered with this film. I now have to see everything this beautiful man has ever made. Dind't like the girl, but maybe that was just jealousy. Go see it: you won't be disappointed."
4,Catching the bad guys,"I read this after reading Donnie Brasco, so I was a bit disappointed in the comparison in the style of writing. But after setting that aside, I found this to be an excellent book with incredible detail in the 'catching the crook' process. Bravo Jules Bonavolonta!"
4,Like revisiting the old hits,"This is a fun album, great pop! ""You Took Me All the Way"" is a ""Go All the Way"" update, just as ""She Remembered"" is pretty much the flip of ""I Can Remember"". ""I Wanna Hear It From Your Lips"" and ""Maybe My Baby"" are fun to sing with, while ""I'm Through With Love"" and ""The Way We Used to Be"" are great achy ballads. The cover photo with Eric with the cigarette in his mouth always makes me shudder, but if you enjoy melodic music with great harmony, you'll love this."
2,"HEY, AMAZON!","After reading the reviews for this 1984 Eric Carmen bowl-bobber and those for his excellent 1975 debut, I've come to the conclusion that AMAZON HAS LUMPED THEM ALL TOGETHER!!! The original doesn't deserve to be paired with this piece of trash. They're two very different albums, one done before Eric began doing music for the prematurely comatose, one that was the start of the coma."
5,One of the best,Tommy Lee Jones had the sense not to change anything about Elmer Kelton's great book. This is a simple story well told. The scene with the dog had me laughing so hard there were tears in my eyes.
3,Good ole Boys,I was somewhat disappointed in the quality of the video. Was it the quality of the manufactor or highly used video? I knew that it was a used video but still enjoyed the movie and was glad to get a rare movie.
5,Excellent 'Nazi hunting' movie! Well paced and done!,"I truly enjoy almost everything that Michael Caine has done. The man is a 'class act' and first rate actor extraordinaire. The acting and directing in this film was top notch, and the film kept me riveted for it's almost 2 hours. One can tell that Norman Jewison is an exacting, detail oriented Director just by the pace and cinematography of this film. I find the subject itself intriguing, and the whole movie was very well executed. To what extent was the Catholic church implicit in covering up and protecting Pierre Brossard? Was Brossard going to be murdered by a Jewish war crimes revenge group? Or was he going to be finally arrested and tried by the French government for war crimes? The ending was excellent, by the way!"
2,Story line moved at the speed of Michael Caine's walk,"Did someone say political thriller? Lopsided? Yes, it was lopsided. It lopped on the side of a slow crawl and boredom. I'm sure that's how the plot was mapped-out, a slow, deliberate pace to the conclusion. The funny thing was how short Matt Craven's part was, before he got blown away very early in the film, by Caine (Pierre Brossard) the French WWII Nazi Sympathizer. Tilda Swinton (Annemarie Livi) was very good as the judge, trying to get Brossard before the Jewish ""hunters"" rub him out.I guess I was looking for a little more excitement, but you can't expect that with Michael Caine now having reached the senior citizen level and moving at a snails pace. Even though he is fast on the draw - fast enough to blow away two ""hunters"" attempting to kill him.Charlotte Rampling makes a short cameo appearance as Caine's wife, Nicole. You may recogniza Ciaron Hinds as Pochon, the leader of the Nazi hunters, who also starred as Carl, in ""Munich"""
3,Somewhat enjoyable read,"This book was just okay in my opinion. I absolutely loved the movie and was hoping the book would be better.... to me, it wasn't."
4,Enjoyable read,"I loved the movie and I loved the book, although in differnt ways. The book has a slew of minor characters that would be too confusing for the movie. If you are a fan of Southern fiction, this book is a must. Even if you're not, check out this title."
4,"Hard to follow, but still very good","Fannie Flagg is such a gifted, talented writer. I could read her books over and over again. However, this particular writing style, jumping back and forth between time, was a bit confusing. It would be 1986, then 1944, back to 1986, then drop down past 1944 and go to 1936. Huh? What came first?! Oh, but after a while I got used to it and rather enjoyed the book and the mystery. Not as good as Daisy Fay but still a readable and engaging novel."
2,I remember the movie being better than this...,"I saw the movie when I was very young (9 or 10) and remember loving it. I have not seen it since then and did not even know it was based on a book until recently, at which time I picked the book up at my local library and read it.I was, well, a little disappointed.I think maybe I need to see the movie again to see if I even like it now, as an adult, as much as I liked it as a child, but as for the book...it was just way too all over the place and simplistic for my taste. The timeline jumped around so much that half the time I wasn't even sure what decade the chapter I was reading was taking place in, and I didn't feel as if I got to truly KNOW any of the characters because of this.I think that the book has some good messages, but all in all it just wasn't what I expected from what I remember feeling for the movie."
3,okay book,"I ususally enjoy the book more than the movie , but when it comes to Fried Green Tomatoes I definiely enjoyed the movie more. I saw the movie about 12 years ago and instantly fell in love with it. I think Jessica Tandy and Kathy Bates are some of the most talented actresses ever. In the movie you get the impression that Ruth and Iggie are just great female friends, almost sisters. In the book, it sound like they are homosexual lovers, or atleast that is what Iggie seems to want. I was sad to see that once I read the book a year ago. However, it was definitely an interesting and sometimes downright hilarious book. You definitely get to know the characters better from reading the book. It made me want to take a trip down to Alabama. I think kids over 15 would enjoy it."
5,"Beautiful, Inspirational Story","This book changed my life. It's practically my Bible. I love it because it has so much faith in people. The underlying philosophy is that people really are good and can do great things. It makes you feel like you can make a difference, if you're good to be people and love and care about people, which is something anyone, rich or poor, old or young, can do.A wonderful, rich plot with a colorful cast of characters, this book is perfect except that it fudges up dates sometimes. But that is not enough to take away a star. This book is essential for all women, and for all men who are cool enough to read abook that is mostly about women."
5,A Southern Charmer,"This book is a refreshing cool mist in this southern summer heat that I am currently living inIt's a whooping 99 degrees here is Savannah Georgia but that's beside the pointFried Green Tomatoes... is such a heart warming book, based upon friendship ,courage and the strength to just keep on living. I enjoyed the movie and watch it when it's on the t.v. but the book holds the prize the blue ribbon so to speak the best hog in the fair the best pecan pie and so on down the list of southern talk. I recommend this book 100 percent"
5,Can you please direct me to the Whistle Stop Cafe...?,"After reading this marvelous book again, I want to say like Ninny Threadgoode that I might be here, but in my mind I am over at the Whistle Stop Cafe having a plate of fried green tomatoes. I would go on a road trip in a flash if I could just find the place...and Idgie, Ruth, Big George, Sipsey and the southern food. This is the thing with this book: it just pulls you in and although terrible things happen, the people with their love and friendship and loyalty make the world a safe haven, also for you, the reader. So, this time around I am going to make the fried green tomatoes...I've got the recipe...it is there at the end of the book. I've always lost my hardcopy, probably lend it to someone. Now, I've got it as an e-book, so I read it again...in a few month's time. One of my all time favorites..."
4,good book,"I watched the movie Fried Green Tomatoes about 400,000 as a kid and loved it. The book can be appreciated on its own but you have to divorce your emotions from the movie. I really enjoyed that the lesbian relationship between Idgie and Ruth is much more clear-cut in the book. The softened it up in the movie so it was kind of up for interpretation. The book makes it clear."
5,worthy fiction,"I read very little fiction, as a rule, because most of it seems to be cut from the same cloth. However when I realized that one of my favorite movies was based on a book, I had to get it. I was not disappointed. Although the movie and book differ in many ways, the true essence of the story is the same. This is the ""feel good"" book of the century!"
2,Not one of his best,I'd have to say that I was very disappointed with this movie. The fight scenes were hard to follow and the story was pretty weak. The bad guy played a pretty good nut case and I'm a pretty big Speakman fan but overall I'd have to say that this wasn't a very good movie. The one thing that I'd have to say I liked about the show is the first couple of minutes where you can see Jeff performing some of his Kenpo techniques. That is really the only reason I ever put the tape in the VCR.
5,Amazing,This is an awesome guage. I work in the tire business and this guage is very accurate and durable. I have used it regularly for a year and a half and will be purchasing another when this one finally does go.
1,dies fast,"of the five guages i bght, each and every one has died! they worked good for several times, but after a month of maybe 6 uses each, each passed on to wherever cheap products go to. wasted my money..."
1,Worthless Fluff: a Toothless Vampire = No Vampire At All,"I can hardly believe this book is receiving positive reviews and is selling so well. The book I read was an embarrassment, weak on every front, academically non-existent, informationally void, with absolutely no ""bite."" The author writes very poorly and presents neither useful information nor entertaining anecdotes, simply throws together a bunch of lame facts, observations, and personal opinions in a lackluster fashion, and then presents it as a work of substance. Most surprising of all is that it comes from Llewellyn, a publisher that used to have some discernment, but apparently is now only interested in what sells. Don't waste your time or your money."
1,why oh why?,"Mariah Carey is already a millionare... why does she have to release this album again? With very few new material...She could have simply released a CD Single for ""Don't Forget About Us"", and it would be better if named ""we belong together - part 2"" or maybe be a little more original and go with ""we still belong together""! Plus having a song only on a CD single, people would buy it a lot! and it would reach #1 on the HOT 100, just like we belong together did...now releasing another version of this album just because of a few more tracks is just low... a cheap attempt to make it bounce back to top 10, so that the new TV ads can say ""after all this time she's still top 10!"" that's CHEAP... LOW..."
4,OK but not perfect.,"All of you haters need to get a life. So what if Mariah wants to release this CD for the third time or even for the 10th time. I mean artists rerelease albums all the time. This CD adds 4 great new tracks but leaves Sprung and Secret Love off, a bad move on Island's part. However, if you don't currently own this CD, then this is the version to own.I really think that kid's should be banned from reviews. I mean what does her weight have to do with the quality of an album review. These reviews should be from people who actually have heard the CD. How fat she is or how much she eats has nothing to do with it. Period."
2,Should have kept my old one,I bought this for my husband to replace a 35 year old avacado grren one that I inheritied from someone. I should have kept the old one. I find the heat extremely difficult to control. It gets hot too fast and takes a long time to cool back down. A disappointment.
4,Cord could be longer,"I like this product for the most part. I bought it so I could use it on my dining room table, but the short cord didn't allow for that without using in combination with an extension cord. I noticed that for fondue for two, you have to keep the temp pretty low, and raise now & then to keep the cheese smooth. Probably works better for a larger amount, the bowl is significantly larger than the double boiler types used in fondue restaurants, so it'd be great for a party. Overall it's a nice unit, easy to clean."
2,It doesn't last,"My husband and I received this as a wedding gift seven months ago. After occasional use, the cheap plastic handles and legs have broken off, and can't be glued back together. This is very upsetting, since it was wonderful for cheese and chocolate fondue before it broke."
2,Disappointed,"Not very impressed with the quality of this product. Actually I was quite disappointed since I had some experiences with Tinker Toy sets from past generations. The new one my son got for Christmas has been breaking & we haven't been rough on it at all. The ends of the rods break off, some pieces don't fit in & some just fall out, plus some of the round pieces are splitting as well. I was very surprised to find out how poorly made this new generation of Tinker Toys is."
4,High price,"Tinkertoys are good classic toys. The product is advertised as a Jumbo set for $120 plus shipping. It is a standard can of Tinkertoys of 102 pieces. A comparable toy at the toy store would be about $30-$40. A Lego set that costs $100 is a large complex set. I am glad to have gotten my grandson Tinkertoys, but the price is too much, and not a good use of toy money. I should have been more careful in my shopping."
2,Poor Quality,"My 3 year old loves this toy, but the pieces keep breaking, chipping or splintering. Nothing like the quality of the Tinker Toys my generation grew up with. I'm very disappointed in the quality of this product!"
2,Fun Toy ...Horrible Quality,"I had Tinker Toys are a kid and they were awesome. I bought some for my kiddo for Christmas and what a disappointment! Six pieces broke the first day! The wood is soft and cracks very easily. Additionally, the holes in the spools are inconsitently drilled so some of the sticks either don't fit or slide right through. I wish I still had my old quality American Made Tinker Toys for my daughter to play with. Don't waste your money on the new Made in China version. They'll break right out of the box."
5,Just like when I was a kid!!,And so now my grandson can build stuff just like I did when I was his age. Helps with all types of early learning skills. Probably more productive than playing computer games all day!!!!!!!!!!
3,Cute and Grippy,"I bought two of these to offer a bit of privacy between rooms. They work great in that respect. However, if you're using these in the same manner as my purpose, keep in mind that shells are a big edgy. They're small and round but they have sharper edges than, say, a bamboo curtain. Walking through without opening a space for yourself will certainly get your hair pulled, jackets tugged, and bags caught. It's worth it for my home since the room they block off isn't used enough for it to become bothersome. These would make fun window treatments or shades, for certain.The colors in the picture are NOT what I received. The shells were entirely gray. Also, there is a bit of plastic string here and there that I had to trim off, but for the price who can complain? They do not come with any sort of hanging hardware so you'll have to provide that for yourself."
2,"Enjoyable, but utterly predictable","This is some lovely brain candy; a decent way to waste a day curled up with a book. There really isn't much here that's shocking or surprising, but it's a good story, although the hero protagonist is the best swordsman, the best ship's captain and the most beautiful woman in the universe. If that kind of character doesn't annoy you, then you'll enjoy this novel."
4,A nice book for a newbie (2 years exp) in Logistics Industry,"Very useful book for me. Contents are related to my job functions, it is like a little logistics bible. :)"
3,Not so easy to size,"Be cautious if you are tall. I am 5'8'' and wear a 32 DD or DDD. I have wide shoulders and the diameter of my chest above the breasts is much larger than the diameter below the breasts (V shaped). The problem I had with this bra (32/24) is that there are no adjustable shoulder straps. Basically it is too short from top to bottom and rides up, pulling my breasts up under my chin. I am thinking of cutting the shoulder straps and sewing in an elastic extension but haven't gotten around to it."
1,You get what you pay for,"All three lids have chips from minor drops, very cheap material and the ""warming"" tray takes forever to ""warm."" Very dissatisfied."
1,Warped Mallets,It is too bad that you can not inspect items before they are shipped out. I got my mallets at a good price and to me in 2 days. I suppose the reason I got a good price was because the sticks for the mallets were warped and not straight. Shame on me. Maybe next time I will just buy them in the store so I know what I will be getting. Beware you may get factory seconds on these if you buy them from Amazon.
4,Tricky set up but works fine for me,This is a great little addition to your pocket PC. I am a college student and can't afford a real GPS for my car (not that my car deserves anything new!) and this has been awesome. It is small enough to go everywhere with me. It runs for a longtime before changing batteries. One of the best features is how fast it will re-route you if you get off your route. I feel a lot safer driving my old clunker around in unfamiliar territory! You can't beat it for the price!
2,I wish I listened to the poor reviews - Waste of money,"I'm a avid hiker and enjoy watching this type of documentary. I was very dissapointed in this DVD. Aside from a few hikers whom I found semi- interesting, I didn't really care if these people made it or not. The film skipped A LOT - most of the trail actually.The film showed a few guys partying, a lost dog growling (milding entertaining) and some hiking. The most entertaining part was one of the bonus features. The most interesting guy went on a rant for about 5 minutes. It was by far the funniest part of the film.No, I didn't buy this film to laugh, but do enjoy humor and entertainment while learning. I was not entertained nor did I learn anything about the AT or hiking that I didn't already know.I first got hooked on the AT after channel surfing and stumbling upon PBS's Five Millon Steps. This was much more interesting than 2000 Miles. Read the poor reviews and seriously consider them before purchasing this DVD."
4,A story about Hiker to Hiker interaction.,"I liked this DVD. I would have given it 5 stars but it left out alot of trail. I would like to have heard more about individual stories. About how people came to hiking. What their life was like alone on the trail. The difficult times. Good times. etc. There wasn't much of that. Most of the DVD is about hikers interacting with other hikers. The interviewer gives open general questions. Like - ""Whats going on now?"" - ""How are you feeling?"". Hikers just seem to give their impressions of the momemt. Not much reflection on yesterday or vision of whats ahead. The story seems to follow one individual in his quest to reach the end of the trail in Maine. I liked this. However. Seeing the isolation of this person. The tired and worn expression. I won't tell you what happens in the end. I will say. Now I know why people quit the hike before completion. Overall a good DVD."
4,tastes real good,"Not sure if it works or not, but I haven;t been taking it like I should, but when I do, it tastes real good."
1,Horrible- don't purchase!,"Caused intestinal problems- find another shake, definitely not a winner. Have purchased many different shakes over the years and this one was not a go."
2,No scooper?,"Alright, either this thing has no scooper or mine came with none which is really lame. There is nothing in my house that measures in grams so I don't technically know how much powder to put. This is extremely annoying. Other than that, it tastes great."
2,Disgusting,"Look, I know there are nasty tasting whole earth raw shakes out there that are seriously nasty, and as an industry we've come a long way in flavor with these, but this vanilla ice cream powder is so nasty that I cannot describe it other than to say that it smells like a cheap ""buttercream cupcake"" candle, and it tastes like a whole truckload of quarters and fake Splenda sweetener rusting in your mouth...the way your mouth is cold when you haven't slept all night, like all that nasty at the same time.Now with all that said, the chocolate ice cream flavor is the best ever!! I make it as an after gym hot chocolate breakfast and it's just delicious and it works like even I can't believe. Get the chocolate and give it a little more water than it calls for, it's great.Gonna try the strawberry one next, hopefully it's like the chocolate one."
1,Misrepresented item,"This retails for $42. They have it listed under diaper bags for their baby deals, but it's not the diaper bag. If you are looking for the diaper bag, look for Tiffany in Blue Tote Set. It will have a button closure at top. To say that this retails for $143 and selling for a DEAL at 42.11 is LYING... and obvious from the last review in February, this problem has been there for awhile.Now, is the purse good? Quite likely if you like open totes, but don't be fooled into thinking this is the higher priced diaper bag."
4,TIGHT!,"This movie is of the hook and amazing in so many different ways. The story was alright a crew tryin to make some money and a guy named Elgin tryin to provide support for his family, as simple as it is the moves in this movie either it's the battle's crew against crew or it's the moves on the court with basketball. The only thing I did not get was Emrald, A buisness guy but thats not the confusing part the confusing part is what elgin and b2k's boy david who is played by omari has to do for this guy. The greatest battle was the very last one the Lil, sanits verses wades crew. With its combination of breakdancin,hip hopin, and somewhat of some drama this movie was tight. If you a gangsta kinda guy get this right away."
4,For the KIDS,"I am laughing at the reviews that are present. I am a mother of three and no I did not go see You Got Served when it was at the movies nor did I rent it for MYSELF. But for my kids I did. When I was younger we had movies that we thought were the best thing since sliced bread and here this movie comes along, clearly intended for teenagers to enjoy and there are a bunch of adults trashing it.I saw no harm in the movie so called plots, the frequent unlimited dance moves or anything at all simply because the movie was not targeted towards my generations. When New Jack City came out, my parents didn't want to watch THAT!Over all, for the kids, I think that movie proved its point. It had the hot guys in there that the teenage girls love and the beautiful girls in there that the teenage boys loved mixed together with some dance moves that only THEY can do... priceless!"
2,I Got Served Rubbish,"The storyline of ""You Got Served"" is a little too similiar to ""Drumline; two groups competing with each other and a contest at the end hosted by some so-called celebrity. At least ""Drumline"" was interesting, but ""You Got Served"" was corny and boring. The dancing grabbed my attention, but nothing else did. Everyone had dancing skills, but no one had any acting skills. Jennifer Freeman is a total floozy. Anyway, don't rush to watch this movie."
1,There had better not be a sequel.,"Because one star is the minimum, I'll give it that. But I find it quite hard to believe that this movie is rated so high. There is absolutely no plot, there is no proper acting, the whole movie basically, for lack of a better adjective, 'sucks'.The dancing is good. I guess. But how much breakdancing can you take before it starts to get on your nerves? I was so bored during the movie that I even started to play on my cell phone in the theatre.The story line is predictable and boring, the acting is flat, and even the dancing was drawn out and repetitive.Don't watch this movie unless you have nothing better to do."
1,WOW! TERRIBLE!,"sooo, this movie is pretty bad. i was pretty bored so i flipped through channels and for some reason i just watched it. sometimes you just watch movies to see how bad they can get. anyways, its pretty corny. oh and when theyre dancing in the rain and theres lighting, wow. that was bad. some of these ""dances"" are just f'n retarded. im not even done watching it yet, but what does that matter. this movie is terrible. i wish i couldnt give it a star but thats how the economy works. dont watch people!"
1,Kill me now,"If you are going to watch this movie for any reason, watch it for the dancing. just be ready to have your remote in hand to fast forward through everything else. Because everything else is COMPLETE garbage. I've read about how some of the fights in the movie between the dance team were actually real fights, and instead of making me think ""oh wow, it makes it so authentic"", all I can think is ""How horribly unprofessional."" I mean really, the actors can't even control their rage while shooting a movie? Thats the kind of stuff you see happening on a high school campus, not on a movie set.Amazon asked me ""Under 13?"", and for a reason. I have a feeling this movie can only be tolerated by children 13 and under, and anybody who enjoyed it who is older, well, I don't know what to say."
3,"AN ""A"" FOR EFFORT","I might be a little bias because I am a huge fan of Omarion, J-Boog, and Marques Houston but I felt that the movie was pretty good. The dancing was excellent the acting is what put a hardship on my rating for this movie.It almost seemed as if the actors were trying too hard. You could definately tell that they were not experienced actors. The scenes that were suppose to be dramtic were a little over done. But they did give it a good try.This movie is worth buying if you are a fan of the actors and enjoy watching good dancing, but not if you are expecting a movie with excellent actors and a deep plot. It is almost as if the people filming the movie ran out of time and did not get to fully develop their ideas for the movie.This movie could have truly been excellent, but it unfortunately fell short, but it is definately watchable."
2,Is This For Real?!?,"This movie is hilarious!! The problem is ... I don't think it was supposed to be a comedy. The acting, if you can call it that, is laughable at best. The paper-thin story lines are contrived messes that were simply ""borrowed"" from better produced, more cinematic urban films. The only shining spot in this abysmal mess is the stellar dancing!! Most people think Wade Robson was the main choreographer for the film. Turns out he only played a minor role with the dance sequences. Most of the kudos goes to Dave Scott and Shane Sparks, but they're not famous like Wade is, so they're not getting their due respect. I suspect they will in the near future.Bottom line: the dancing is the only reason to see this film."
1,Are You Kidding? This gets Zero Stars!,"What I would like to know, is who exactly is funding these types of dumbass movies? And in what universe did someone decide this crap was worth the paper/disk the screenplay was written on and the film it was filmed on? And what's even more disturbing is that this movie was #1 the first week it came out! Which makes me only wonder what kind of people would pay money to see this? This movie was ghetto crap...yes I said it! It had to be said."
3,Not That Good,Sure the dance in the movie are exciting but thats the only part of the movie that will make u get into it.
5,rumble on!,"This is superb,! the best 60s instrumentals. I am going to swap my Fender for a Danelectro ! The Batman theme is dynamite"
5,YUM PURRRRRR,"Our Mamma bought our food from Amazon cuz she was able to get 2 bags delivered right to where she works without having to make a special trip to the store just for us kitties!Thank you, Meow-ee New YearMittens and Boots"
2,oilier skin,my skin is oilier with this . I use maybe once a weekSince I can't return it . It leaves my skin smoothBut within an hour or so I touch my face andIt's all greasy. :-( I wish I could get my $$$ back.It was not worth what I paid.
2,Full-Room Oscillation Coverage...false advertising!,"It advertises ""Oscillation for full room coverage"". The box it comes in shows the heater in the middle of rooms. All suggesting it must oscillate almost all the way around or close to a 360 degree rotation. However, it rotates a mere 30-40 degrees which is less than half the circumference between the two front legs! ""Oscillation for full room CHILL"" is a more accurate description. It goes back to Walmart."
4,Nice little heater,"I have had it for a few months now and overall it is pretty nice. You can only set the temperature in 5 degree increments. 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, and 85 are the options. I have it set at 70 degrees and it keeps my place 71-74 degrees. It doesn't turn all 360 degrees, only a little under 90 degrees. It stays cool to the touch, except for the metal screen. That part gets very hot but the rest of it can be touched even when the unit is on (my dog knocks it over sometimes), although 80% of the unit is cool. It also doesn't shut off automatically if it falls over. It is not loud, I rarely even notice it is running; it is much quieter than my other space heater. Well worth the price in my opinion."
5,life saver,"This little darling is saving my butt this winter! I have a mobile home and have closed off all but two rooms. My heating system is a heat pump which cost me a bundle last winter. So far, I have used only this little heater to keep me warm. I'm waiting for the next electric bill to see how much it has saved me.I purchased a second Lasko for my bathroom this winter as the first heater worked so wonderfully. I can't say enough good things about this little heater. For someone to give a negative rating simply because they had to push the temperature buttons to the desired setting tops my list of lazy.I love that the heater turns off once the desired setting is reached.It did end up cutting my bill significantly."
4,not enough heat,"After reading other reviews of this product I purchased. Generally I do very well with purchases based on other reviews. However this was disappointing. I expected this to take the chill of a room, not even heat it, however unless your sitting directly in front of the heat it does very little. This might be good for a very small room but not much for a family room.11/15/2011 Update - We moved this heater to our bedroom which is a decent size and can be very cold. We used it each night last winter and have begun using it this fall for a couple of hours a little before we get into bed and then for about an hour while in bed. The timer is great, we set it for 2 hours @ 75 degrees the rooms warms up nicely and it shuts off as we fall asleep."
3,"Good materials, moderate workmanship, questionable packing","Unit was delivered promptly. Package had extra tape, which could indicate prior opening and re-closure. Top of unit has long scrape mark, marring finish but not penetrating below color. Vertical partitions do not fit holding grooves well in vertical direction; gaps are obvious (offset corner cut back too far from end). Back panel was cracked near one corner but still usable. Panel damage was likely caused by either poor packing plan or incorrect repacking. Some scratches near ends of vertical panels indicate possible prior assembly. Some dowel holes are oversize, so dowels fit loosely and don't provide much support. Unit will serve its intended purpose, which does not require a highly visible or attractive piece. Outside finish is OK. Piece is OK for the price. (Photos of damage available if desired, except for dowel holes.)"
1,JUNK,"Came with mounting brackets that were broken,and one light didn't work.No satisfaction w/seller,threw in the garbage.Gave one star because you have to fill this field."
2,Poor quality.,"I did like these headphones while they lasted. I purchased the pink and white version from Amazon a while ago and they lasted barely a month of use at home while on the computer before the wires came loose. That was that! Unfortunately, my experience with Skullcandy products hasn't been good, in spite of the fact that I love their designs and keep trying my luck. If they could get their product quality to consistently match the aesthetic quality, we'd have a real winner."
3,Not to be confused with Tito Puente & Hector Lavoe!!!!!,I bougth this DVD thinking it was a compilation of Hector LAVOE and Tito PUENTE. Boy was I dissapointed. Not on the young kids but on my need to get eye glasses. I didn't bother watching this DVD. I'm sure it's ok. The three star is for the misleading title. These rappers are young. They've yet to make History! :(
2,Not an easy fit,Extremely hard to put over the Mecco grill I purchased. This would be better if the cover had a drawstring it could be loosened befoe trying to put over the grill.
4,Great fit,I am very happy with the guality and fit of this cover it works perfectly well and provides the protection my Meco grill needs
5,Awesome,"I have many Documentaries. This one is by far the best. The Blu-Ray display is exagerated, and when they look at a straight drop, you may feel ill. They travel through Europe and scale many Mountains. FUN!"
2,Visually stunning...just be sure to mute the volume!,"Cliche breakup scene from 1983 called and wants it musical score back. Seriously, the sound track pretty much ruined an otherwise, decent documentary. My wife and I couldn't stop making fun of the music long enough to pay attention to the movie. One positive is that it was absolutely visually stunning as should any IMAX equipped documentary in the setting of the Swiss Alps and it was a somewhat interesting story but was it just me or did Harlin's voice overs sounded a bit disjointed? And by disjointed I mean sounds like he's been sniffing paint for 20 years?Here's a bit of advice. Edit the film and release a new version, swap the musical score for something more mountaineering documentary and less cheesy 80's lead guitar, provide Harlin some public speaking lessons and then rerecord his voice overs. Repackage and sell film as ""The Alps Without the Dream Theater guitar licks"" and then and only then, you may have a 3 or 4 out of 5 documentary."
1,First disappointment for Belkin product...,"The other 2 reviews pretty much sum up the problems. My addition is I have always purchased Belkin cases for all my personal/portable electronics and this is my first disappointment.Whether that is Belkin's or Microsoft's responsibility, I'm not sure.For Zune owners who want a case that can move from office to club to home without the necessity of removing to charge or connect, this case is not it.BELKIN DEVOTEES, PLEASE NOTE: while not included in description, dedicated Belkin customers might expect the excellent belt clip Belkin is famous for. This case has NO belt clip.Enjoy the Community, fellow Zune owners!"
3,Used in class,"Orginally purchased for class and it was actually used. Was not too bad of a novel, better than a textbook."
3,Not what I expected,"This anthology hasn't held my interest. I couldn't get through the first story. The concept is great, the stories are slow. Anita Bunkley is best known for her work in historical fiction. She makes a good effort with her piece however she lost me. I wish Micere and the brother would get together, get rid of her ex-hsuband and relocate and move on to the next author. Maybe I will try it again during the winter."
2,Long and Drawn Out,"I had to struggle through this book. I like the premise but the story line was sparse and it was too long and drawn out for me.Fluffy read with a little bit of a naive plotline, where the protagonist, portia flits between two enemy lines...."
2,Not very good,"Purchased this phone and am returning it since it ""hums"" whenever there is a call. I even tried it at my vacation home in a different state but experienced the same problem. Not worth the hassle."
2,Be aware of what this is before you buy it,"I was disappointed by the content of this collection. Granted, I should have done more research into what was actually contained in the DVDs. I was looking for a recap of every goal, both in the group stage an in the playoffs (or, at least, a bit of every match). Instead, this series, for the most part, shows only highlights of the main games of each world cup. Team celebrations, arrivals at the airport, bus rides, fans partying, locker room talks, and, in some DVDs, even the personal stories of stadium workers are heavily covered in these documentaries. Nothing wrong with that if you are interested in the ""behind the scenes"" aspects of what goes on in these torunaments. In that case, you may find these DVDs interesting. If, like me, you want to see the goals and summaries of the matches, you probably do not want to purchase this product."
2,Disappointing,"I've found that this skillet heats unevenly, therefore making it necessary to frequently stir things to assure uniform cooking. Moreover, there is virtually no ""simmer"". If a low temperature is set, the heat goes off and eventually comes on again briefly. Cooking items that require simmering requires close monitoring and regularly reseting the heat, a real irritant."
2,Disappointed,"Hey Amazon, what are you doing? Yesterday there were 2 reviews for this product and I submitted a third, which was very unfavorable. When I checked this page today, I found the notification that there were NO reviews for this product. Is this some kind of shell game that you are pulling? So much for Amazon's credibility!!"
2,Not Great,"This book is adequate as a textbook, but it's not a great resource for what's really going on out in the world. I felt it was very academic--which can be a good thing, but I think high school students will want something a little more practical. ""Street"" Law should be something more connected to the streets....I just didn't think this book did the job."
4,My first fishbowl,This toy was displayed with water between the plastic on the sides of the bowl. It did not arrive as the display or picture showed and was a disappointment.The toy is cute but the water would have been fascinating to an adult or baby.
3,Stitching on clam came apart,"A friend bought this for my daughter when she was 4 months but I didn't bring it out until she was 6 months. I thought it was going to be a great toy for her since the star fish/crab/fish/clam all made different noises and had different textures. My daughter also loved to grab and chew on the fishbowl itself. Unfortunately, the clam's stitching came undone after she had been teething on it. So now I just try to keep the clam away from her and watch to see if she will tear into any other of the sea-life."
3,a little advanced,the fishbowl is adorable but my granddaughter did not stay interested for long. She is 7 months and I think it was a little too advanced for her. She did not even try to put the sea critters in the fishbowl--all she did was put them in her mouth. Her mother put it away and will try again when she is a little older.
3,cute,This is a very cute toy with different sounds and textures for baby to explore. My kid never understood the in and out concept. Even now that she's 2 she pretends she drinking the water from the bowl rather than putting the toys in and out.
2,Not as Described!,"Was supposed to come with ""Water-trapped sides of bowl with mini-sea creatures"" but didn't and when I went to return it for a replacement I was told I could only get a refund. I just want what I ordered and expected to get in the first place."
3,A good book for examples,"This book is exactly what it says. I would not have bought this book if it wasn't required for a class. For one, it is just a list of fonts on every page with different point size examples. Two, it will not help you with typography in any way. I prefer to make my own style books based on the fonts that I own. It is frustrating to look at fonts in a book that has fonts that I do not. The best thing about this book is the fact that it is what it is, a font style book. I will probably never open it again and will probably just use it to buy time with a client that doesn't know what kind of typeface they want."
2,Not what I expected...,"Bought this to use with my art class as a lettering reference.Was ok. I expected the book to be larger, with larger typeface, so the kids could trace the letters.It arrived on time and in good condition. No complaints about the seller."
1,FICTION,"Warning: This book is not a history book. It is a historical novel, and a badly written one at that. Whoever marketed this seriously needs to make that clear before other people get duped into buying a book on what is a very interesting time. For a real historical book on this topic seeStephen and Matilda: Civil War of 1139-53 (History)."
4,Well enough,"After reading the Muirwood series, I went forward with Landmoor, as some have said, we have the Elves and Dwarfs or what appears to be them being called something else with a separate history, so be it.Seems to me that Mr. Wheeler gives us a bit of Religion, SciFi and Fantasy and I like it! The story was interesting, although the main hero was a bit ""weak"" in my view, but I guess this is a ""coming of age"" story. The story and plot was interesting and the writing itself, excellent! Mr. Wheeler has a way of moving the story amd plot without all the boring ""middle stuff"".Am now reading Silverkin"
1,Street glow which is dim indeed,"The image misleads and much as the title: there is a bare glow and a faint 'projection', if one calls it that. I have been had....."
1,Too descriptive... inappropriate for a Christmas gift.,"I gave this book to my 70 year old mother for Christmas based on the reviews I had read from another online store. Unfortunately, these reviews did not start out like the review on Amazon. My mother called me up to describe the book and I was horrified. She read me the table of contents and I cannot believe I sent her this book. I appreciate Amazon's description of the book and would not have chosen this book for the gift had I read those descriptions. PLEASE be warned that this book is not appropriate for most readers."
1,Indigestion,"It seems, reading all these other reviews, that I am not the only one who has a limited tolerance for Burroughs' schtick. He obviously doesn't know how to get off it. He obviously has gained no real perspective on himself and the toxicity of his world/life view. Sad.Just not something I care to ingest any more. Maybe when he comes out with a book in which he laughs at himself for having been so juvenile for so long...NCM"
5,Loved it...,"I haven't laughed out loud while reading a book in a very long time. How a person could emerge from an abusive, depraved, drop-out background and create something so great is a mystery, but he has achieved this. Many may wonder how they can actually like a person with these qualities and feel empathy for him, but the fact that he HAS survived, and still has the capacity to love another person makes it honorable. He does love, and he does get help. Anyone who could write something like ""Debby's Requirements"" or ""Key Worst"" is my hero. His book ""Dry"" is very good too but more tragic (and yet, more hopeful)but it gives better insight into Burroughs' psyche."
2,Jumbled,"Building on ""Running with Scissors"" or ""Dry,"" you could easily feel that this book might have even more to offer about this author's life. However, while I felt the stories were mildly amusing and Burrough's has a talent for sarcastic writing (like Bill Bryson or Mary Roach), this book I found overall chaotic and without merit. Why aren't the stories in chronological order at the very least? What is the point of this book? It seems almost as if you're listening to a friend talk endlessly about himself with no regard for what you might like to hear (or pay for). There's no cohesive bond to hold the stories together other than they are about the author. Perhaps it's time for time for Burrough's to show a little versatility and less self-indulgence."
5,BEST BURROUGHS BOOK,"This book is charming, funny, well written, and my favorite of all of Augusten's work!!!"
5,Loved it,"I personally liked part Ip Man 1 better, but this one is Kick Ass fun too, i really wish that the Lee family (Bruce Lee) would have allowed this movie to cover the father/son relationship between bruce and Master Ip...but all in all i am hooked on the Ip man series, i loved the hell out of the first one and i also love this one."
4,IP Man 2 Review,"This follows the story of the first movie, IP Man. It has a good story line but not as strong as the first. It follows IP Man, and his family as he transitions into starting his own school and the merge with the British Empire. Donnie Yen gave a great performance again. Has great martial art fight scenes like the first, just shown in a different light. I highly recommend this movie, but you should see, IP Man, first."
5,ip man2,I received this dvd on time and in excellant condition. The movie I would recomend to all action fans and those who especially enjoy martial arts.I give this 5 stars.
2,Below Average,"In one scene, Ip Man (YIP Man) fights off 20-30 people with machetes and in other a westerner who plays the sport of boxing gives him a run for the money!! It cannot make sense to anyone even with a peanut for brains. They create a whole drama of Chinese Kung Fu vs western Boxing. One is a martial art honed over 1000s of years while the other is a sport. And in the end, they call both forms of fighting almost equal!! It is simply ridiculous.Below average movie in all regards."
5,Awesome,This movie was seriously awesome. I did not expect it to be this good. Great pick. Everybody should see this. On the same level as Ong Bak
2,Not Squirrel Proof,If you don't really care if your feeder is squirrel proof or not then this is a nice feeder. But I bought it mainly to stop squirrel's from stealing all the bird feed and this doesn't do it no matter what strength you set the spring at. I find the squirrels put three feet on the ledge above the perch therefore most of their weight is on the ledge so the cover does not close all the way and they can lean over and munch happily away.
1,Not Squirrel Proof,"The concept was good but not good enough for the squirrels. I have this bird/squirrel feeder. The squirrels hang from the top with their feet and avoid the lever while eating the seeds. After spending that much money on a birdfeeder, it was very upsetting. Don't buy it."
2,Disappointment,"We purchased this book after my toddler daughter read some of the wonderful Bartholomew and George board books (""Be Gentle"" and ""I Love You Just the Way You Are"") at the library. These stories were sensitive and age-appropriate tales of a toddler learning proper behavior.This collection (unabridged) included these stories in addition to some new stories we had never seen. These turned out to include ample examples of bad behavior. For instance, in the ""Eat Your Dinner"" story Bartholomew only eats dinner when he knows he will get dessert. In the ""Go To Bed"" story, Bartholomew fights with George every step of the way. Our kids may do this on their own, but I don't know what we gain by demonstrating bad behavior in books. If you want to buy ""Ba and George"" books, try to buy them individually so that you can be selective."
5,Quality Light,"This is the only light that doubles as a safety reflector. It comes with a variety of mounting options, rear rack, trunk bag, and seatpost. It is very bright and has continuous and flashing modes. Overall a well designed and functional light."
4,good at night only,"the light looks good, uses AAA batteries which are easy to install and I'm sure cheaper that those overzised watch batteries the other blinkys I have use. its nice and bright at night(which is what I use it for), just wish it was bright during the day or cloudy days(cant have it all)."
5,Great Book!,"I had never used GoLive before and was kind of freaked out when I first opened the program. Then I went to an Adobe seminar and one of the authors of this book was a presenter. He was really excellent and knowledgeable, so I decided to buy the book. I'm glad I did! I've now created two Websites and am starting my third. This time I'm getting paid! I know I still have a lot to learn, but this book got me up and running FAST. The best thing about GoLive is the way it works with my Photoshop files. If you haven't used this yet, check out the convert to banner trick!!!! Saves you tons of time!!!!!"
2,So So,This was a So so book for the beginner and not as organized as Classroom in a book. I was a bit disappointed as a beginner.
1,I was cheated,"I received the WRONG creams...returned them and NEVER HEARD FROM YOU OR THE COMPANY. I called them and E Mailed them and returned the wrong creams. I have never heard from THEM or YOU! Shame, shame on Amazon! Barbara Buckner What a bad deal! I was charged quite a bit of money for NOTHING."
5,World Without Gravity,"I was first introduced to the Jim Carroll band through the movie Tuff Turff and was instantly hooked. I searched for quite some time before finally discovering this CD on Amazon. This is one of those rare albums that you won't want to skip any of the songs. If you're unsure of the music I recommend previewing a few songs, I prefer YouTube for this. In conclusion I find this to be a god value for the money."
1,Low Quality - Might fool very young kids,"This is a very low quality item. It might fool a 4-year old, but anyone older can clearly see it's not a real scarf. The fabric from the red side continues over to the green side, so you can't show the entire scarf, which basically makes the trick impossible to use on any over 5 or 6. As the previous post said, though, it's cheap and for kids."
4,Different Twist,"This was a different twist on the boy gets girl, romance novel. Easy read, holds your interest. Some of the language in this book while acceptable in most circles, was unnecessary."
3,IT'S ALL RIGHT.,"This is not a bad book. Perhaps I went in with too high expectation, I don't know. But it didn't grip me as much as I had hoped for. Over all, it's an okay read, and I will recomend it."
5,Great mirror,"I did more research than perhaps healthy on this one. Every other unbreakable mirror has a weird circus-like distortion, but this mirror has a much cleaner/accurate reflection. You can use it multiple ways. It is a simple toy, and a definite enhancement to tummy time, helping to build neck and arm muscles."
1,Distorted reflection,"When I received this item, I was hoping my 7 month old baby would be able to see a clear image of herself. She loves to smile at herself in our bathroom mirror when we're holding her. I know that it's a safety mirror, but I felt like I was looking in a funhouse mirror. It made me dizzy! I don't think my baby would even have recognized herself when she looked in it. Not recommended if baby wants to see a clear reflection."
4,get it!,"This EP is not as produced as some of the other P5 stuff, but that's part of it's charm. It's also more rocky and less poppy. And it's only $6.00!"
5,perfect,"This was purchased as a gift for a 4 year old little girl. Excellent quality, very soft and cuddly, and very nice for the price!"
4,Great resource,"You know, I read all of the previous comments and was reluctant to buy the DVD as a result. However, there just aren't that many DVDs on France available at Amazon so I decided to take a chance any way. Frankly, I'm glad I did.I was specifically looking for a resource that highlighted each region of France and that's exactly what this DVD did. So what if the clothing or hairstyles are a bit dated? It is still a wonderful introduction to the country at large.I'm a teacher and I developed a lesson plan for students to study the various regions of France on their own. This DVD gives a great ""taste"" of each region without going into too much depth. It's just enough to spark curiosity and research. Do not be fooled by other reviews, I thought the DVD did exactly what I was looking for.There are also extra video segments on the DVD that can be used as well. Again, they are a bit dated, but again they cover the essential France. I loved it!"
2,NO MEDLOCKE NO BLACKFOOT,"i bought it, and could not get past the fact that ricky medlocke and jakson spires are not a part of this. the vocals are not even close,nor are the two new guitarists trying to match medlockes ability.the new lineup gives it there best shot, not a total waste of money, butfor me blackfoot is and always will be fronted by medlocke."
3,Not sure,My six year-old received this for his birthday and hasn't given it a second glance. But he was the same with Lincoln Logs a while back and now loves them. So I haven't given up hope yet.
1,A hostile witness' unfriendly report,"Kimmerling is a political science with an agenda.For many years he has been a firm supporter of Palestinian Arab nationalism, and his writings continually work to undermine the state of Israel, and especially its Jewish character. In this work he ignores those researches which point to the fact that the overwhelming majority of Israel's citizens share basic values, as to the Jewish and democratic character of the state and tries to argue that Israel is falling apart into seven different socio- ethnic tribal groups.The real point is that Kimmerling aims at helping produce the disintegration he is claiming exists.My suspicion however is that the state of Israel will be thriving long after Mr.Kimmerling is no longer available to deliver us his awkwardly written distortions."
2,Poor,"I have been a fan of all the ""Classic"" escape movies of WW2 such as the Great Escape! After reading several books on ""Colditz"" and the exploits of the POW's, I could hardly wait for the movie to arrive. After watching the Colditz story I was very disappointed at the lack of escape attempts outlined in the books such as the ""Glider"" I also found the humor of this movie very corny. The German guards are portrayed as idiots without a clue as to what is going on which made the move even more unrealistic. The various books written about Colditz are not done justice by this movie."
3,vent lid,nice lid. easy to install. the descripions page could use more information on ID measurements. i would reccoment this vent lid
3,"Absurd, yet kind of fun...","This is a tough review to write. I actually enjoyed large chunks of the book, but the last 150 pages were nutty. There is too much set up for a less than enjoyable ending. Concidence, tragedy..how many people can die? How many people can believe this silly concidences. Yet, Archer captures boarding school well. I certainly had fun reading the novel, but they saw Archer is capable of much more. I hope so. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. A decent cheap read."
2,How dows this affect women?,"How is it that Archer can be deemed, ""one of the top ten storytellers in the world?"" Through out this book there are young women wanting to get pregnant and married all before graduating college. One character shows her love for her boyfriend by telling him that she'll give up her education to support him in his career. What message is this sending?? Does Archer have a daughter? Is this what he wishes for her? Authors today need to better understand social responsibility."
1,Hard to believe this is actually written by Archer,"I'm not going to waste a lot of words repeating what everyone else has already said, and to be honest, I only managed to read the first 200 pages before tossing this book aside. I found the characters indistinguishable from each other. In fact, I kept having to flip back to the beginning of the book to remember the differences between Nat and Fletcher, Tom and Jimmy.Actually, the characters are so uniformly flat, it seems even the author himself couldn't keep them separated. On page 70 of the soft-cover version, Archer has Jimmy replying to Nat (he meant to write ""Tom"" but obviously the editor of this book had fallen asleep by this point too). Archer goes back to using Tom after the first error -- but it just compounded my frustration with the boring, similar characters.Enough said.Avoid."
2,Find the coin toss,"I agree with the disappointment of the factual errors in the book. However, for those that skimmed pages you missed the clue to the winner of the coin toss at the end. What frustrates me more than reading the book to its end is that I have to go back through for one more painful journey to find the coin toss reference that happened within those pages. It was there, and I remember reading it- that ""he"" always guessed ""heads"". Where was it? at the beginning of a debate? a game? darn!I invested far too much time getting to the end to leave it ""unfinished""."
4,An Allnighter,As a Jeffrey Archer fan I expected to enjoy this book. There were several shock sections and a lot of jumping from one main character to the other. I find this difficult when using my Kindle as I can't flick back in the book to check on some detail I hadn't absorbed. This is one of the disadvantages with E-Readers. I was disgusted with the print production. It was almost like it had been translated (inaccurately) from another language with many words incorrectly written making no sense at all e.g. trick as bick. I don't expect to have so many spelling errors in a book I have paid money for.
2,Microwaved Jeffrey Archer,"Archer is one of my favorite authors, but Sons of Fortune is nothing more than Kane and Abel nuked in a microwave. It has none of the emotion or well-drawn out characters that make Archer such an enjoyable author. It has all of the hallmarks of Archer books (two protagonists, a antoganist that stretches back to childhood, lots of women, business takeovers, etc.) with none of the juicy storytelling that allows Archer to rise above being a supermarket-rack novelist. The ending (last few chapters) is entirely implausible, as Archer allows the story to careen out of control. The end of the book turns into a Perry Mason movie. Archer needs to get off the two warring protagonists kick and get back to writing other storylines. A promising start turns into a disappointing finish."
2,look at a map,"I agree with the other negative reviews. One more comment: didn't Archer or any editor bother to look at a map? The book repeatedly refers to traveling ""up"" to NYC from Connecticut, and ""down"" to Conn. from NYC! I'm dizzy ..."
2,Zero Vietnam Research,"His total lack of knowledge regarding Vietnam military operations, equipment, and terminology show that Archer didn't bother with basic research. Lazy, lazy."
2,Disappointing - but great reading for transatlantic flight!,"Intriguing idea, but Archer disappoints. Elliot is a great villain, but there's no revelation on his motivations. Improbably, Nat and Fletcher do not even react when they are told the BIG NEWS. Archer fails to explain the thrust behind Nat's and Fletcher's political leanings, in spite of introducing ambiguities surrounding both of their politics during their high school/college years. Get this book if you need something to distract you during a flight... otherwise, I would give it a miss."
1,What was he thinking?,"As a true Archer fan, I couldn't wait for this book to come out. I had to have it the first day and what a waste. I was so disappointed with this book. It was so predictable that it is not worth the paper it is written on. This had to be one of my all time worst reads. I skipped a few pages here and there and I didn't miss a thing. IT IS TERRIBLE!! Don't buy it and don't even waste your time getting it out of the library. Disappointment to say the least. I wish I could get my [$] back or my time."
1,reason alone to extend archer's jail term,"this was AWFUL. the story is mind numbingly uninteresting but the dialogue is insipid. it is written like a bad soap opera script and the court scene is so preposterous it is hard not to laugh, all the while kicking yourself for wasting time and money on this [junk]. they should keep this guy in the slammer for eternity for writing this trash!"
3,Brando is awful....,This must be one of Marlon Brando's most lamentable performances. He is ghastly. Despite that the film has much to commend it and the transfer to Blu-ray is very good. The Tahitians are excellent and the scenery magnificent. By a whisker I prefer the Gibson version of this epic tale and hopefully that will come to Blu one day. In the meantime if you can stomach Brando and the price is cheap this is an interesting view.
3,Pretty Good,"Mutiny on the Bounty is a lavish remake of the 1935 classic. This ok remake is wonderful to look at and it is good until up to the ending. The landscape is visually beautiful, and also Tarita is a pure vision. PLEASE SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS."
5,If you want to make policy...,"I'm the director of the Masters in Advocacy and Political Leadership (MAPL) Program at University of Minnesota Duluth. Ours is a weekend program, aimed at young and not so young people who wish to learn how to change policy--in whatever direction they wish to see it changed. Policy Paradox is the first book our students study and it sets the tone for our program because it is both analytical and realistic. There's nothing else in the field quite like it. If you want your students to understand the reality of policy decision making, Policy Paradox is the book you want. If, on the other hand, you want them to learn how to build rational choice policy castles in the sky, you'll have to go elsewhere."
3,Bored of Boards,"3 pretty darn good tracks in between a lot of boring flutter and purr. Good for studying, and impressing your friends. Bad for your wallet! ...."
3,Weirds me out,"This album really weirds me out. Also, note that this is the only album released by Boards of Canada. The tracks on this album remind me a lot of my childhood. There's a lot of whispering and stuff like that. Really gets on my nerves. I will admit that if I could somehow get over the weirdness of this album I'd listen to it all the time, but I just can't. - so only 3 stars instead of 5... you might want to give it a chance - I think it's just my personality that prevents me from enjoying this."
5,AMazing!,"luv it. every song has something to offer. no boring discomfort while listening and a yearning for more, more, more. i'm a youngling in this type of music so i can't go into details. but try it, try it!"
2,"No music, just random sounds and voices","As a kid, playing with a tape recorder sure was entertaining, replaying phrases and sounds over and over. It was not as entertaining when someone else did it though. That's what this CD asks of you - to listen to someone's high tech recordings of sounds and words repeated over and over again. To take something away from this CD, as other listeners claim, baffles me."
4,Good stuff from BOC...,"I am rapidly turning into a Boards of Canada junkie after buying their ""Campfire Headphase"" album. ""Music Has The Right To Children"" is an earlier work but still has the goods in it, being a little more light hearted that the darker Campfire. Get ""Campfire Headphase"" first and if you like it then get this one."
4,Board-er line brilliance,"Disconcerting, disturbing and curious are not words that lend themselves to great music readily. In the case of Boards of Canada, however, there are few more suitable - the whole album has an otherworldly feel to it, with hazy beats underpinning snatches of sampled speech, children's voices and keyboards. The creators live up to the mysticism that the music evokes too - members of the cult of The Purple Octagon Sun (whatever that might be), they are extremely elusive and media-shy. The album has no obvious beginning or end, with tracks that blend into one another leaving no obvious boundaries. Mysterious and enchanting, this is music everybody's children have the right to hear."
4,Boards of Canada,"Good album. Despite the name, these guys, a Scottish duo are not Canadian. Oh yeah, the keyboards on this album are reminiscent of early 1970s Brian Eno Music for Films era.--Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, 2001"
1,:oP,"Methinks the impact of this cd is exaggerated a tad. The impression I got was that this would be the kind of stuff you would hear played in the background of some venue that attracted very pretentious people. The kind that continuously shift their opinions in accordance with what got thumbs up from the latest edition of an entertainment magazine. I guess if that is what this kind of music is aimed at then yeah, it does a good job, but life changing it most certainly aint. Interesting, it is not. Nostalgic, no. Uneventful....? Yep!Oh, and that piece going on about censorship, is sucka$$weak.I didn't like ""music for cats"" much either but I recommend it over this. At least mfc delves into depths of emotion more effectively than this does."
5,Boss paid the Cost,I love the album. I was only 13 when it first came out and believe me I had enough taste to still enjoy Born Gangstas til this day. This was the first tape I bought for myself after seeing the Deeper video. This is still a legand to me. Still livin' loc'd
1,They pretty much suck.,"I bought these specifically for using on a 7-day cruise. Had I paid any more than $45, AND if there was anything better out there, I'd be sending them back.The range sucks. You can't communicate from Carlos & Charlies to the Forum shops in Cozumel. You can't talk between the gym and the outdoor pool bar on Rhapsody. If it's quiet, you can talk between the Casino and the theater or between the Solarium and cabin 7574.The sound sucks. With ANY background sound you can't hear the speaker. With no background sound, you can't hear the speaker unless the talker is exactly 12.72 inches from his/her unit when speaking.The battery life sucks. It won't last all day.The charger sucks. Even with the charge light lit, it sometimes doesn't charge.The red screen lighting sucks. It's too dim to see unless the moon is NOT out.Other than that - when it's very quiet and the other party is only around the corner they're not bad!"
1,"I read this for my college comics as lit class, even did a project, so i have a good understanding of the subject matter.","This book is just slap stick with no plot bad dialogue, 0 intrigue and completely flat characters. I wish i could still return this book. If your 12 and you love the fact that you can act like your 12 you might like it because its straight forward action with nothing to understand or dig up. If you want to find meaning in this book you would have better luck squeezing water out of a rock."
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,"Reading this book evoked emotions equivalent to the experience of purchasing a vehicle at a car dealership. A lot of convincing sales talk leading to hollow results. The concepts presented are not new, scientific, or innovative as sold. The concepts are simply gift wrapped in expensive paper. And many are false, deceptive, or simple common sense.Other points of interest: originally written over a decade ago and contains extensive outdated information, lacks focus, discusses unhealthy dietary practices, and ? If you are looking for a motivation book - don't waste your time or money. Look elsewhere..."
3,Good Ideas,The book is easy to read.It does not lecture you but gives you good ideas on how your mind works when it comes to behavior and discipline.
5,"To be your best, you must first learn how and why.","The biggest key to life and success is learning how and why things work. If you are able to learn and APPLY this you will get anything you please. This book teaches you that. It assisted me in my understanding on why things happen, internally and externally, and how to control them instead of letting them control you. If you are looking to make a change, you are definetly looking in the right direction."
1,The dumbest guy in the room,"This book is written by Chris Lincoln, a former college soccer player who was admitted to Middlebury with 980 SATs. He hastens to add that in the re-centered SAT, his scores would be 100 points higher. The basic argument of his book is that recruited athletes are less academically capable than other Ivy League and NESCAC students even though all available statistics suggest that they are. The book is a response to William Bowen's excellent work on athletic recruiting in the Ivies and other elite schools, 'The Game of Life: College Sports and Educational Values'. Lincoln meets Bowen's sophisticated statistical and social analysis with anecdotes and quotes. Bowen says that athletes underperform in these colleges; Lincoln find one guy who did not. Bowen's book is widely acclaimed; Lincoln finds one guy who does not like it. Worse Bowen either does not understand many of Bowen's arguments or has willfully chosen to ignore them. This is a sloppy book."
4,Watered down but remains true to the original,"It's sad that today's youth (and myself included at that age) are really ill-equipped to handle Shakespeare. That being said, however, O with it's tragic ending seems just a little bit unrealiistic in a modern setting. But it certainly is imaginative to have it set in a modern day prep school with the title role transformed into a black basketball star in an all-white privileged environment. Unfortunately something is lost in the translation. Yet the jealousy and deception remain.And I just have to comment that athleticism is something that just can't be faked on film. And as much as I admire Mekhi Phifer as an actor his basketball talents leave much to be desired. Plus the 8 foot rims were a little ridiculous. Mekhi 'O' gives a credible performance (as he always does) just not over the top.A good introduction to the Bard for our younger viewers."
2,"SEE IT FOR SUPERIOR SILENT GERMAN ""OTHELLO"" ON DISC","Shakespeare's tragedy ""Othello"" set in the world of highschool basketball? That's ""O"" (Lion's Gate), an interesting experiment that somehow does not quite jell.Mekhi Phifer plays the titular basketball hero, Odin ""O"" James, Julia Stiles is his steady Desi and Josh Hartnett is the double-dealing Hugo. This two disc set features a modest commentary by director Tim Blake Nelson (the half-wit convict in ""O Brother Where Art Thou"") and cinematographer Russell Lee Fine, a look at the elements in setting up the basketball scenes and interviews with the stars.But what makes this DVD worth considering is an incredible bonus feature, the extraordinary silent German version of ""Othello"" starring the electrifying Emil Jannings. This restored, mostly forgotten German expressionist film blows away the contemporary take on this tale of a deadly jealous rage."
5,great cast,"This movie is the best remade, Shakespeare movie I think I've ever seen. It doesn't have Shakespeare's script, but it is based on the play very well, except that it is modrenized. Odin, which is the character based on Othello, is played by Mekhi Phifer, and did an excellant job protraying him, is a star basketball player, at his all-white school. Julia Stiles, (Save The Last Dance,) plays his girlfriend Desi. Hugo, who is played by Josh Hartnett (Pearl Harbor,) does a wondeful job of playing everyones friend, and making Odin jealous, becuase he makes Odin think that Desi is cheating on him with his best friend Mike, who is played by Andrew Keegan (10 Things I Hate ABout You / 7th Heaven,) which starts this whole plan to get revenage on Mike and Desi. Very tragic ending, and very well written."
1,Horrible,I would have given this movie zero stars if I could but it wouldn't let me.I must admit I saw this movie because of Josh Hartnett being in it but that was the only perk and even that wasn't saying much because his character was horrible.If you have had a bad day defintely do NOT watch this movie. It leaves you feeling depressed and it is a complete waste of time.
1,Bland and boring,"I was not going to bother with a review of this book and just agree with Tregatt's excellent review. But, anyone looking at the star rating for this story might think it has potential as a good read. It is not a good read and Tregatt's review explains why. Bland, unfocused, sometimes irritating and totally boring."
5,Another Gem from Tolkien,"The title of this book should say it all. Certainly a book designed for die-hard Tolkien fans, 'Sauron Defeated' hardly represents interesting reading for people unfamiliar with the Lord of the Rings series. That said, the thick volume is still essential for anyone who has read the previous three chapters of the History. Although some parts of 'Sauron Defeated' are better off left out in its next edition, it presents enough interesting information in its 482 pages to make it a worthwhile (not to mention impressive) presence in your Tolkien library."
1,Not well laid out,I bought both the German and Spanish Pro software packages. I opened the German first and found it very confusing and poorly laid out. There is no clear lesson plan and there are no steps provided for LEARNING the language. They might as well just drop you in the middle of Munich and expect you to start learning German that way. Needless to say I didn't open the Spanish Pro software and returned it... Unless you already speak German and want to brush up (even then pick something else) you might want to think twice...
4,Fun movie with an 80s feel - but Amazon streaming sucks,"Finally had to go out and just rent this from a Blockbusters, because somehow between my mac, my girlfriend's PC, and every major browser on each of these (and the Amazon Windows app, which was crap) we still couldn't get it to work in anything above completely pixelated, blocky crap quality. Now we're on a 30mbps pipe, and Netflix has always worked fine on both our computers, in high quality without any glitches. So it was a wasted $4, and I'm just surprised Amazon's product failed so comprehensively.Oh the movie? It's a fun flick. Not much depth but an enjoyable ride. Definitely feels 80s -- but that's part of the fun. Switch off your inner critic and your 80s hairstyle detector, and you'll enjoy it."
1,Most overrated movie of all time...,This thing was terrible and I thought it couldn't get any worse until I was forced by my wife to watch Speed 2!
5,Best album I own,"After reading reviews of the album on this site, I was a little hesitant to buy it, but since I already had the other three and adored them, I figured it was worth it, but I wasn't left with high hopes. Well, thanks to those who said ""it's not their best, but..."", I ended up being thoroughly impressed and placing it at the top of my list of best albums I know of. Just about every song is flawless. Best tracks are ""Bless The Child"" and ""Ever Dream."""
5,Nightwish at their very best.,"Entire album's a masterpiece. Tarja is an amazing singer, Oceanborn and Wishmaster are great but her voice was a little over the top. She sounds a lot better vocally on Century Child. Marco does some lead vocals also and it's their first album with him. It has a more mature sound than their earlier stuff and it's a little heavier, more symphonic metal than power and more diverse. It has a few ballads like Forever Yours and Ever Dream, it also has one of their heaviest songs to date Slaying the Dreamer. All of their albums are good but this one's amazing and it's one of the best albums I've ever heard. It's between their unique sound and heavier, more mainstream direction. Their most complete album to date. Feel For You, Forever Yours, Ever Dream and Slaying the Dreamer are the best and I'd recommend this album, it's not worth missing."
4,Disappointing - but still a good CD,"The new CD from Nightwish is pretty good, but nowhere near as good as any of their old CDs. Tarja is still great, and I do like the addition of male vocals as a change of pace. But the guitars on this CD are a huge letdown after their first 3 phenomenal CDs. Tarja's voice alone just cannot carry this band with weak guitars and keyboards.However, this CD is still pretty good, so if you've already got their other three and you love them (of course you do), then you'll want to get this one too. The best songs on this CD are Slaying the Dreamer, End of All Hope, and Dead to the World.But if you're new to Nightwish, buy their other three CDs first - Wishmaster, Oceanborn and Angels Fall First. They are all amazing, it doesn't matter which one you start on."
5,Best of Symphonic Metal - ever!,"""Nightwish"" has released some albums after ""Century Child"", but however non of them can compare to Century Child. Many say ""Wishmaster"" is the best Nightwish album ever. -I say they for sure have not even heeard about Century Child!""Feel For You"" will take you away to a mysterious place and ""Dead to the World"" must be one of the most powerfull songs troughout history! The power of vocalist ""Tarja Turunen""s voice is enormous!If you buy Century Child you'll definitly will get the best of Symphonic Metal."
1,A pathetic piece of vanity publishing,"Books published at the author's own expense really should contain a warning on the seller's site. If no reputable publisher will touch it, it's likely to be pretty bad. And this one is. I was unlucky enough to buy the book before it was reviewed on site. How I wish I'd waited! It truly is appalling. I didn't know enough about the subject to recognise the historical errors, but the bad grammar, patronising style and nauseating 'folksy' wisdom made reading it a very unpleasant experience."
1,"Blah, awful",The only good thing about this movie was Lauren Bacall. She was great as usual. The sound quality sucked on this one. The story was very slow. Don't waste your money.
2,A dreary trudge through personal agendas,"Susan Bordo obviously knows how to write well; she also demonstrates a respect for research. Perhaps expecting more illuminating philosophy from these givens makes this endless tome all the more disappointing. Bordo seduces our attention with a few sentences at the beginning of each chapter, only to fizzle out with dreary recountings of her own experiences with the Male Body. While she has a few good moments in defining the spectrum of male/female role-play, this overworked dissertation is a difficult book to complete. And it is hard to make this topic boring....."
3,"Not as good as ""Dress To Kill""","""Circle"" is OK, but I wish I rented it instead of buying it. Highly recommend ""Dress To Kill""."
3,Just ok,"Compared to Eddie's other brilliant master piece 'Dress to Kill' I found this DVD to be rather disappointing. I consider D2K the best all time Standup comedy dvd, so I guess it's a little bit hard to compete with, but it's after all himself who is doing it. He lacked pulling in the New York audience in the way he did with the San Francisco one, and he was not as vibrant. I've seen other unreleased DVD's which have been much better also."
3,Average Izzard,"Not as funny as Glorious to Dress To Kill. The show does have it's moments, especially in the end when he talks about the Death Star Cantina. Very funny bit. It seems like most of the show are spinoffs and rehashes of previous materials with similar setups and punchlines. Not his best stuff. Watch Glorious and Dress to Kill before buying this one. The bonus material, however, is very interesting to watch. It contains a behind the scenes look of the cirlce tour as well as a trivia bit which pops up during his act ala ""Pop Up Videos"" (trivia bits like how New York City got the nickname ""Big Apple"" and the length of the Statue of Libery's index finger)."
3,Pretty funny but..,It's always good to see Eddie Izzard and there are some very funny parts and some not so funny parts - but it had me laughing out loud. But what is wrong with this DVD ? It is supposed to be wide screen but the picture is way off on my TV and the sound is out of sync with the picture. It made it very hard to watch.
3,"Not the Best, but still Good.","Although Bim has had better albums this one is still worth buying if you're a big Ska fan. Bim Skala Bim has definately done very well with their music, and have made a small name for themselves in the world of music. Songs such as ""Eyes and Ears"" have a catchy feeling to them, but they don't last forever. If you're a big Bim Skala Bim fan get the CD just to appreciate it, or if you're a ska fan give it a spin just to say you've heard the CD before, and enjoyed it for its brief amount of glory."
4,A solid original argument for tranactional privacy,Dr. Rahn argues persuasively that the danger of nosy governmental scrutiny of private digitized transactions far outweighs the potential for criminal misuse of this new technology in the age of cyberlife.
1,makes your laptop slow or freeze,"it does not work, after one week made the laptop slow or frozen and I have to plug the adaptor all the time.it is a mistake to buy it especially because the seller-BrilliantStore- covers only 30 days from the day you order the item."
1,this program is clumsy,I brought this program for my relaitves who came from India and I found it very clumsy and difficult to navigate and use. The applications on the different CDs are not cohesive and I find the whole process of using the applications difficult to use 1) I can't click on the different options too well 2) It teaches only very basic sentences 3) Does not teach any grammar. I was better off teaching my relatives by myself.
4,An Okie event,"I would have rated it 5 stars, but it moved a little slow at times. A good friend of ours was the ""losing"" coach in this movie and we had the chance to see some of the filming. It was heart-warming to see how the town of Nowata rallied around the movie-makers. Many of the actors were Oklahomans and the extras were Nowata citizens. It was indeed an exciting event. I was very pleased with the finished product. It trully reflected the small town life in Oklahoma and lifted the spirits. No cussing, no sex, just pure down home fun. Even our 14 year old son liked it, although he probably wouldn't admit it now. I plan to buy it as soon as the price drops."
3,Singularity,"The author over explains some fairly simple physics about singularities at the novels beginning, and his descriptions of goverment agencies and private corporation skullduggery is somewhat heavy handed and inauthentic. People are a bit cartoonishly sketched and the writing is non-engaging. As the climatic scenes unfold finally there is some imaginative physics and hard science based action to offset the distinctly third rate writing skills."
3,Not worth the hype....,"I purchased this book because it was recommended as a ""good read"". I was very disappointed. The concept is interesting but found the characters and the action to be flat. It seemed the book was disproportionately devoted to building the relationship between the two main characters at the expense of plot. I tended to skim over much of the book and it wasn't until the final chapters that it started to get interesting."
3,workout,It was pretty fun. If you're really in to working out it's a nice change of pace but the work out feels one sided like your body isn't getting the same work out on both sides of the body. I thought it was fun but and I learned some new moves but I rarely do it unless I need an ego booster work out.
2,It works ok.,"I bought this unit with the expectation that it would work really well. I followed all the recommended cleaning instructions, and when I cleaned a ring of mine per the directions, it looked as if it was never cleaned. Wiping the ring down with a soft cloth made the ring sparkle more, but I could still see the build-up on the stones and in-between the stones. I am not sure if a good ring cleaner and a small soft brush wouldn't accomplish the same job."
4,Classic Hans Zimmerman,Well done score. I didn't care much for the movie. But the music creates a nice mood. It's nice just to listen to while working or playin' on the 'puter. There is a nice mix of the culture of where the story is based.
3,2 songs missing,"It's a good CD, but I was really disappointed that it didn't include 2 songs I was looking forward to. The first one was ""JumpAround"" by House of Pain, and the second one I don't know the title, but it was the one when they were about to do the mission and they were loading up on the helicopter. That one guy that came up to them and said ""leave no man behind"", and the song started playing. It was a bummer, but the rest was good."
4,Historical photos,"This book gives a basic description of the differences between the cars, for each year. But it is not a detailed technical description. Just a general discussion focused on the marketing aspects of the changes. The pictures are all black and white historical photos. I would have liked to see some color photos and paint schemes."
5,A Great Quick Read! NOT filled w/advertisements!,"I began buying this back in the summer EVERY Friday when it came out, mostly because I was buying US and People and for way too much $$...this is $1.99 on the newstand and it's great! The stories are to the point, good and factual. Even my mother who isn't very much into these types of magazines started buying it. It's sort of being a bit nosey and keeping yourself up on the celebrity scene. I literally read this cover to cover and keep it by my bed. I can usually read enough stories before falling asleep...they don't go on and on and on. I'm subscribing!"
4,From the East BUT has tha Style of the almighty West Coast!,"This album is tight,them being from the east wont ruin it cuz they got tha flows an beats of most west coast underground artist,strickly for you hip hop heads,this album has tha lyrics that will make you wanna hit rewind,an tha beats are all lined up for your ears to digest.buy this album!its freshalicouse."
2,XL Denali Road Bike,"Cheap price but you get what you pay for.Brakes are the antique caliper style that can be upgraded to side pull cantilevers with a little work.Gears are generic gripshifter style but nothing close to the Shimano 105 standard.Bike is all aluminium and is quite heavy.Also the front cogs are small, good for hill climbing but not great on the flats.The handlebars can't be raised any higher also. They are fixed.I would not buy this bike if you are taking road biking seriously but it's OK for a cheap introduction to the sport before you get serious and upgrade with a new bike!"
2,TRIPOD FELL APART - MISSING PARTS,"I fell in love with this tripod as soon as I saw it. I got it for Christmas and when I pulled it out to film with it, one of the legs came off. Fell right out of it's fitting. So I had to put it back in and use it like it was. Then I noticed my camera wasn't staying upright. It was falling slowly in a clockwise movement. I went to tighten the screw that keeps that part in place and there is no screw there to tighten. You can see where one should be, but that part was missing. Now I have a broken leg and a box of tooth picks keeping my camera in an upright position. Nice.I am calling Calmulet after New Years Day and asking what they can do for me. $179.98 and $15 to ship is a lot to pay for broken parts and missing parts. I will keep you updated. Today is 12/31/09"
1,The typical formula dog book,"This book was one of the first Beagle books I have read and I was not impressed. The book is formula based... right down to the generic dog care chapters. If you want to be an informed dog buyer, this book doesn't cut it. I feel that the average buyer needs to also be informed about more complex issues such as responsible breeders and genetic diseases (more than a small paragraph). It is important to know what a Beagle ought to look like, some background (this is a hunting/pack animal!), and how genetics actually works. I recommend the New Beagle if you want to know more about your dog than what you could easily find out by reading the encyclopedia. The New Beagle not only spouts off the standard but helps illustrate it. I feel the average reader is more intelligent than formula books give them credit for and the The Beagle : An Owner's Guide to a Happy Healthy Pet just doesn't cut it."
2,A reel sleeper.,"This is a weird, artsy film containing no meaningful story or plot. Something ""they"" would have MADE us watch in high school or college. This film follows two young women who find in each other refuge from the rest of the world. A world full of evil parents, evil schoolmates, and your basic evil Christians. I could not relate to the characters in any way, and certainly not their ultimate agreed-upon goal at the end. A complete waste of time."
1,"""This movie sucked!""","This was a bad, bad, movie. They never showed the girls getting arrested, no trial, no nothing. They didn't even kill the mother until the end of the movie and that was it. A couple of giddy future lesbians having the time of their adolescent lives."
4,HIDEOUSLY HEAVENLY --- but what about the future,"Heavenly Creatures is not really the kind of movie you could ever really admit to loving as it's sick consepts barely leave you with any grip on reality - similar to the feeling one gets after such movies as Schindlers List. However while Kate was as convincing in her rols as ever, I would like to see a sequal... Surely after all these years in the real world the two friends/lovers would be permitted to reunite! I am aware that it was part of their contract but surely it could be reviewed. I believe Heavenly creatures was a love story - Romeo killed for his love and we call it the essence of romance so why don't we consider this the epitimy of love and friendship?"
3,Do NOT buy this poduct for the Surebonder 9600!,"Please note: This product (300-38-5M 3/8 Inch 22 gauge staples) will not fit the Sureboneer 9600...this product is for the Surebonder 9610. There is a difference in size and I did not find this out until this product arrived and stated on the staple box for model 9610. Thus, with my Surebonder 9600...I went to my local hardware store and purchased some Arrow T50 HD staples which worked just fine."
5,This game is tactical and fun,"I have been playing real time strategy games since Command and Conquer and and turn based games since civilization. The pace in the demo of RTW was not very fast as the front line usally holds for several lines as u attempt to flank your enemy. If you are worried about this game requiring twitch skill ""the ability to move the mouse fast and accuratly"" it is not and if someone is that bad with a mouse they should stick to turn based rpg's. Now that the demo is released i can say without a doubt that this is a superb strategy game even without dipolmacy. This game has great graphic smooth controls and alot of strategy. So if your looking a good RTS look no further."
1,Almost there,"RTW is ALMOST a wonderful game. It's full of great ideas but it's seems finish in a rush, and it's shipped incomplete. It seems that 80/85% of the things in the game are complete, and in the others are plenty of bugs. The worst it's the load game bug (well, 'feature' in the Creative Asambly termonology). The AI lost of this long-term plans after a reload and play dumb for one or two turns. Of course, CA denied this and have no support/no acknowleged about this bug.So, it was a pity. RTW is almost there, in the edge of be a great game."
1,poor tactical battlefield,"in order to command well, you have to use a pretty far away view, then all soldiers became so small, like a group of ants.Though impressing when stationary, however, when in action, the 3D soldiers act so awkwardly, like puppets. For those interested in the Roman genre strategic games, I'd rather recommend other games like ""Nemesis of the Roman Empire"" or ""Legion"" by Slitherine."
5,Worth the time and the money.,"Before buying this game, I had played all of the previous Total War programs each of which was better than the previous. This game follows the same pattern and is better, by far, all of the other versions. The graphics are excellent, the interface is simple and the sound is great. I am glad that I ignored the negative reviews that have been posted about this game and bought it anyway."
4,Typical review from an individual who enjoyed the game and has very little else to say,"I would heartily recommend this game to any fan of Strategy games of any sort. I say this simply to elaborate and reaffirm what has been said in other reviews: I am a real customer, and I enjoyed this game. The only issues I spotted were minor issues with the AI and following orders during a battle. However, these issues are nothing in comparison to the great fun to be had while playing this excellent addition to the genre."
2,Smell the pretty flower.,"It is always true, that the more one plays a game the more problems they should see. This game's pretty graphics can easily hypnotize some gamers. Some other games have also coasted to perfect scores through visuals alone regardless of actual gameplay. Sadly for gamers, the main game hides many serious issues unless one is attentive to what is actually going on around them in the world. [...] Early on, these player could see the poor AI and problems with control of units. These troubles alone should have pushed RTW down to 3 stars. Now other major problems and bugs have surfaced that simply end the game for those aware of them. These issues are very serious and kill the whole POINT of the game! Remember - A flower may be pretty, but that does not amount to much if it also STINKS."
1,immense potential... squandered,"This is a painful review to write. I really love this game. I really do. But it's like loving an abusive spouse. The way the company chooses to support its product and the way they have gone about public/consumer relations is deplorable. [...][...]It is a shame because I loved Shogun:Total War, and I really had faith in the developers. No longer. If they cannot even admit that the save/load function is severely flawed, let alone dedicate the resources to fix it, what response do you think they should expect from their end-users? The saddest part of all this is that there are obviously very good people in the company, and you can see they poured their heart into what easily could have been one of the best strategy games ever made, only to have that vision squashed by whatever corporate maneuvering has occured to bring us all to this low point."
1,Sluggish & not as much fun as TW: Medieval,"This game is very difficult to control via mouse, even though my computer exceeds the system requirements by a long shot. There are times during battle when it's almost impossible to select a unit, because the mouse takes several seconds to move.Very clunky, and a disappointment after Total War: Medieval."
2,Two stars at the $16 price!,"Horrendously expensive erotica for what it is.I bought The Switch on the recommendation of a friend in my book club, as I like my doms to have moments of submission...especially in romantica. This is sexy for the most part, though it's a bit flabby in the middle and could have been trimmed to make the story slightly more interesting and the sex slightly less repetitive. That said, I bought it for my iPad, and it was INSANELY expensive. $16? What?! There's so much other great switch erotica out there...SO much cheaper and much more romantic! (If it had been 5 dollars, I'd have given it 3.5 stars)Skip this and head right over to Allyson James's Shareem books. They're cheaper and better written, and there are several that have switching` heroes."
2,Unlikely to appear on the Book Snob*s list of great sequels,"While the Rock Snob book was both an interesting encyclopedia and a witty critique of a sub-culture, this just seems like the employees' manual from a slightly above-average video store. It doesn't seem to get the cineastes, the gorehounds, or the fan-boys in it's scope. It just seems a MEDITATION ON the slightly off-beat with a nod toward the classic.It's probably this year's gift of choice for people you don't want to drop $30 on a Criterion DVD for. But they won't find it amusing."
5,Stress Reliever,Keeps your head up and back straight. Makes your laptop usage more productive. A must have for the small home office.
2,Es un teclado costoso y pesado,"Este es el analisis del productoCONTRA:1 - Es muy pesado2 - Solamente tiene una altura, por lo que no ayuda3 - No trae la fuente4 - Por el mismo precio puede conseguirse un teclado inalambricoPRO1 - El teclado responde suavemente al tacto"
1,DON'T BUY FOR MAC NOTEBOOKS,"The mechanism that props the notebook up is not adjustable, and will not lay flat enough for MacBook / Pro notebooks to angle the display properly. The rubbery finish attracts dust and dirt like crazy, the feel of the keyboard is repulsively squishy, and the overall design of clasps / inputs is simply sub-par. For $70, I was expecting a higher-end piece of hardware, not this total piece of junk. Don't buy it--it's a gimmick."
3,Great stand & keyboard but absolutely useless USB ports,"As title said, especially I like the keyboard. No software needed for special keys, like volume control. The only withdraw is USB ports. Like other people mentioned, no power cord is included. If you plug in anything into any of the USB ports, it won't work as long as the device requires electricity. With this price, I do believe the power cord should be included. And because of the price and the withdraw, I think it is worth 3 stars only."
5,The BNF,This is an exceelent book for any one wanting to find out more about the drugs we take. I am a psychiatric nurse who wants to up date on recent medications. This is the best drug book available.
4,DAILY STRENGTH,THIS IS A VERY GOOD BOOK AND IT IS VERY HELP IN EVERY DAY LIVING. I WAS GLAD I CHOSE THIS ONE.
1,"Horrible, horrible, horrible!","If I could give this 0 stars, I would. The Albert Finney version is so far superior to this trash that I hardly know where to begin the comparisons, but I'll try. Max Beesley is not remotely believable as a seducer of sophisticated women, Samantha Morton's Sophie is too silly for words and nowhere near attractive enough to drive a man to distraction. Brian Blessed was scarily manic rather than funny as Squire Western. All in all, this production was an incoherent mess.I don't always go along with professional reviewers, but I have to in this case (they hated it too!). Rent the Albert Finney version and enjoy (especially the scene at the inn with Mrs. Waters!). There is a reason why A&E never showed this again; it is a waste of time."
5,classic,His best serious album. Amazing what Zappa can do when he 'plays' an orchestra as he would 'play' his rock bands. In the classical charts for a year and it deserved to.
3,"It's ""okay""","My kids played with it a few times then forgot it about it. I thought it would have more vibration or ""boom"" to it. Banging pots and pans is more fun."
5,"Marvelous product, near nonstick","The precise temperature control offered by this product makes it a delight to use. Don't be alarmed by the suggested stickiness in the previous post. In fact, stainless does not need to be seasoned to perform like non-stick cookware. Proper technique, which consists of1) heating the surface to the desired temperature (1 min),2) adding oil,3) waiting briefly for the oil to come to temperature (20 sec),and, finally,4) adding ingredients,will ensure outstanding results. For professional-quality food preparation, stainless steel cannot be surpassed, and this dishwasher-safe product makes the experience painless even for a novice."
4,Urban Legend,"This movie is a great source of camp, and one of the only movies out there that unintentionally serves as its own satire.I heard an urban legend that perhaps someone more knowledgeable could clarify for me. It goes something like this: Prior to this film, marijuana was legal (or, at least, not illegal). A chemical company (that still exists today, so I will refrain from using its name) made a chemical used in the process of making paper from wood pulp. Paper made from hemp (marijuana), however, did not need this chemical and was thus cheaper to produce. The chemical company, therefore had a great financial stake in demonizing (and eventually outlawing) the marijuana plant so that it could sell its chemical to paper manufacturers. It was this company that financed and distributed Reefer Madness, which was part of a propaganda campaign to make marijuana (and thus hemp) illegal.Does anyone out there know if this is even partially true?"
4,The movie we all laugh at now,"This movie was made to scare its generation away from marijuana. Now, its extreme exagerations and ludicrousy make it cult classic. From saying that the new ""drug menace, marijuana"" is far worse than cocaine or heroin to an introduction that states the film will only be a success if you are too scared to ever think marijuana has any good intent, the film goes too far to ever be considered serious. The film fails at its mission of scaring the public away from marijuana, but allows us to laugh at just how far the US Government went to continue the prohibition. All and all, the film is best if you see it with you ""buds."""
3,A gov't commissioned film re: the evils of marijuana,Hillarious in the beginning however does drag later on. What makes this film so interesting is that it was commissioned by the government to inform the public of the dangers of marijuana. The film however is based entirely on falacy and simply was a ploy to scare people into not smoking the drug. A wonderful display of gov't integrity - HaHa. It's pretty funny.
3,Viva La MST 3K!!!!,"I havn't seen this kind of ... since the last Tony Danza Marathon. This movie is chocked full of propoganda against the ""Evil Drug"". Not that I think smoking ""The Reefer"" is a good thing by any means but I don't think it will make you go crazy and go on a killing spree. Through out this movie we follow Bill, Jimmy and Mary. All fine upstanding young children until they get wraped up in the wrong crowd (stop me if you heard this one). Jimmy introduces Bill to the wonders and horrors of sweet, sweet cheeba. Inevitably Bill becomes a ""Reefer head"" and starts to sluff off in school. Jimmy meets a worse fate when driving under the influence of ""The drug"". This movie shows all of the terrible things that can happen to you when you indulge in the weed ranging from sex, murder and PERMENENT INSANITY! I thought it would be more funny but it was a good laugh all the way around. Worthy for the likes of Crow and Tom Servo."
2,I need rehab after viewing this.,"I'm sorry to say I really didn't like this movie. I know this old B&W titilation flick disguised as an expose' is supposed to be campy and funny - it's not. It's grossly acted by a company of hams who weren't aware of the term ""moderation."" Had the actors been doing this movie tongue-in-cheek, well, maybe then it would have been worth a chuckle or two. But you just know they were playing this thing straight which makes it painful to look at. Watching a person unknowingly making a fool of himself isn't funny to me. Watch this only if you are smoking reefer, or to say you've seen it, or to get your Hacker Card punched. If you must watch it, watch it for free. Don't spend your hard earned money on this relic."
4,Very Good film noir (almost),"This is a frequently overlooked good film with very good acting about a woman who has psychological problems and although it woud be considered film noir due to subject matter, it isn't because it's shot in beautiful color (something I normally find objectionable, but not in this case). It's a good movie that desrves to be watched by more people."
5,I WAS THERE,IN 1952 A SECOND LT. BY THE NAME OF JIM BRADY JOIN THE CONPANY OF A MARINE CORPS FIGHTING COMBAT UNIT. IN HIS DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT ACTUAL HAPPEN DURING HIS STAY WAS AS THOUGH YOU WERE WITH HIM. HE DESCRIBE THE THINGS THAT A COMBAT MARINE GOES THROUGH JUST TO SURVIE. HE DID NOT MAKE THINGS UP TO THRILL THE READERS BUT WHAT ACTUALLY TOOK PLACE. SOME OF THE EVENTS THAT HAPPEN WERE TO HIMSELF AND JIM PULLED KNOWE PUNCHES IN WHAT HE DESCRIBE. LOTS WERE OF THINGS THAT HE WROTE ABOUT WERE NOT OF THE FIGHTING BUT WHAT A MARINE GOES THROUGH WITH IN THE LIVING CONDITIONS FOR PERSONAL SURVIAL. HIS SCOPE OF WHAT A COMPNY OF MARINES DOES TO CARRY OUT THE MISSIONS OF A BATTLE IS LIKE BEING OR LIVING WITH THAT UNIT. IT IS A BOOK THAT ONCE YOU START READING IT YOU FEEL LIKE YOU ARE WITH THIS COMPANY OF MARINES AND THEIR STORIES OF CARRYING OUT THEIR ASSIGNMENTS THROUGH VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT TIMES.
3,More propaganda and newsreel footage than serious documentary....,"The Korean War has been terribly under-represented in both print and documentary. The late David Halberstam's work, ""The Coldest Winter,"" should hopefully rekindle some interest in it. This war certainly deserves better than this documentary. As typical of Timeless Media, this is really a series of newsreels of with a heavy dose of propaganda (decisively anti-Communist as a sign of the McCarthy era) trying to pass itself off as a ""documentary"" to the unsuspecting buyer. While slightly better than ""The Great War: WWI"" another disappointing production of Timeless Media, it is, by no means, definitive.Those seeking a more comprehensive examination of the Korean conflict would be better served by other series available elsewhere like, for instance, ""The History Channel."" Buyer Beware...$9.99 is too much to pay for this set; I purchased mine at Ross-Dress for Less for only $4.99."
3,What a waste of money!!,The only thing good about this is the sea shell bed case for baby Krissy. The Barbie's tail does not move or bend. She can not sit down. The other factor for my bad review is my child has trouble holding her fingers on the contacts to light up the tail in the water. I am glad this was a gift and I did not purchase it myself.
1,Don't Waste Your Money...,"I started to buy this doll for my daughter for Christmas, but then took a good look at it and noticed that she wouldn't even be able to dress it. Mattel sells a Barbie mermaid outfit .... My advice? Do what I did- Buy a regular Barbie doll with LEGS so that the child can have more play options, and then just buy a mermaid outfit for the doll separately."
2,Disaster,"Very limited content, no pictures and double the price you are supposed to be paying. No thanks, I'll pass on it...."
2,un prix exorbitant pour un monde aussi austere !!,"lecteur regulier du monde papier, la version electronique semblait un bon complement. Il semble que le journal prenne ses lecteurs pour une vache a lait !"
4,"Le Monde je t'aime, mais pas de photos!","I love the convenience of being able to download and read a current version of Le Monde to my Kindle when I don't have access to the Internet, or when I'm in the mood to practice my French reading skills. At a price of $0.75 / edition, it's a bargain, compared to the cost of $6 to buy a two-week old edition at my local Borders.My only complaint...and it's more of an annoyance, is that I'd like to see pictures, just like in U.S. newspapers, such as the NY Times. Is there anywhere we can make this wish known?"
5,Lineage of this Sherlock Holmes pastiche,"Curse of the Nibelung is now in a new, revised reprint of the 1981 edition originally published under the Marcel D'Agneau psuedonym but now published under the original authors name Sam North. This book is hilarious, at the same time it is very faithful to the Conan Doyle spirit. North/D'Agneau also wrote the very funny pastiche of John le Carre's spy fiction 'Eeny Meeny Miny Mole' - an affectionate spoof of 'Tinker Tailer Soldier Spy'. Curse of the Nibelung is worth adding to any Holmes collection and it would make a wonderful crazy film. Recommended."
1,USE CAUTION!,"My boyfriend's cat has been eating this food for six years. When I switched my cat over to it, she developed a UTI and has been urinating all over the house. She also gained a ton of weight. Other reviews I have found online show that cat owners have had similar problems with their cats getting sick from eating this food. PLEASE use caution! This could make your cat ill. If your cat does eat this food, always keep an eye on him or her. I always thought male cats were more prone to UTIs and yet my female cat was sick. It cost me over $300 in vet bills from feeding her this food!"
2,Watchable but disapointing,"I honestly was looking for a typical Adam Sandler comedy. With the lineup this movie boasts, I was ready for side splitting hilarity from title to credits. This movie did NOT deliver. Aside from a couple funny moments inserted to break up the drudgery, this movie is not worth watching. Unless of course, you feel as though you need a lesson in Gay rights, which is all this movie is about. Essentially it's a public service announcement for liberal gay tolerance, which I have absolutely no problem with. Where I do have a problem is when it's billed as a comedy, and I paid to buy the movie thinking it was something it is not. The plot has so much potential, but instead of going the typical Adam Sandler route of crude adolescent humor, it takes a turn in a completely different direction. Happy Gilmore fans will not enjoy this film.If you rent this and it looks blurry on you're screen, you need to buy a monitor with a faster refresh rate. It's you're screen, not the film."
3,It was just ok,"Over the years I have grown to Love Adam Sandler's humor and off-beat comedies. When this came out I was so looking foward to another Adam Sandler classic. So, how was the movie, it was just ok. To be fair the good intention of the same sex driven humor was evident, but there was something that was missing. All of the personalities were extreme without the payoff. The ending resolves all of the relationship conflicts as a movie should, but after just making it through the movie once you will likely not need to do it again. Wait until this is on cable, you will appreciate it more."
5,Very cute,"This movie is just as cute and funny as any other Adam Sandler movie. Of course I wasn't disappointed. The story is fairly predictable, but there's comfort in the expected and in just watching an enjoyable movie for laughs. Funny moments that make you laugh out loud and then repeat funny lines later with your friends. The ""homo humor"" isn't offensive and even some homophobics will find it a cute movie."
4,very funny movie!,I went and seen this a few days ago. My friends and I laughed all the way threw it. This is a must see from any fan of Adam Sandler and or Kevin James. Can't wait for the dvd release.
4,Another typical Happy Madison production,"This movie is ALOT better if you live in a place where you can enhance your mood before you turn it on...Adam Sandler has found a great formula for making profitable movies...Get alot of funny people to star in them and then letting them adlib alot to find unique and funny lines that will make you laugh...Add this film to your Adam Sandler, Kevin James or even Ving Rhames collection."
4,Pretty funny stuff,"This is somewhat of a drama-comedy blend, given its running time and some of the seriousness that underlies the comedic situation. Chuck and Larry are hetero friends who decide to fake a gay marriage for financial reasons.The performances from Sandler and James are quite good, and Dan Aykroyd turns up as their boss.It is not all that memorable but good for some laughs."
3,Adam Sandler,"I like Adam Sandler, I've loved his movies since I was 5. This film has it's funny moments, but I'm not a big Kevin James fan."
3,A Few Good Chuckles,"I enjoy Sandler and James I thought did a decent job as well. The story is about two firemen that try to get around a death benefits law by pretending to be married. Overall watchable just not their best. Sandler has had a number of funnier and James was best in ""Hitch"". So I suggest this one for a rental first. Not particularly a family comedy and some of the jokes go beyond good taste. My wife made it very clear I was not to buy a copy of the DVD. It is rare she makes that kind of request. I would have to give it low marks for replayability."
4,Really funny movie!,We really enjoyed this movie from the beginning till the end. I had my doubts at first but I am so glad we bought this movie. It has been awhile since I've had some good laughs. Def recommend this movie!
1,"BEWARE, NOT A HAT BUT........",THIS IS NOT A HAT!!!!!!! IT IS A VISOR WITH A FABRIC BACK AND NOT A CONTINUOUS BRIM WHICH MAKES ITS UNCOMFORTABE AND ULTIMATELY USELESS TO ME.YES IT COVERS THE NECK BUT THE FABRIC SITS RIGHT ON THE NECK WHEREAS IF THE BRIM WAS CONTINUOUS THE FABRIC WOULD DRAP AND FEEL LESS HOT AND CLOSE.NICE PEOPLE GOOD COMMUNICATION BUT IT IS A REAL BOTHER TO RETURN ANYTHING FROM MY POST OFFICE AND I DID NOT WANT TO BE IN THE POST OFFICE RETURNING THIS SO AGAIN BE FORWARNED THIS IS NOT A HAT BUT A VISOR WITH A FABRIC AND ELASTIC BACK VERY DISAPPOINTED AS I NEED A BIG BRIMMED HAT BUT CANNOT AFFORD THE TILLEY.JUST GOIN TO FILL THE CLOSET I GUESS.....
1,Awful! Don't waste your money,"This is the most awful stomach work out DVD I've ever had--6 work outs is a great idea, except when most of the work outs don't target the stomach muscles! The dance work out was just plain strange. I'm actually putting this DVD in the Goodwill box, something I've never done before with a work out video. I'll go back to my ""Abs of Steel"" series!"
3,David Bowie as a vampire--how hot that could have been,"I wasn't really expecting much, I just wanted to check out David Bowie, but to my surprise, the movie actually started out interesting. I was really excited when Bowie's character, John started to age right before our eyes as he waited for Dr. Roberts in the hospital. Unfortunately, I was interrupted by a phone call just as Dr. Roberts came to visit Miriam to enquire about John. When I resumed, lo and behold, Miriam and Dr. Roberts started going at it.I'm not at all offended by the lesbian sex scene, it's just that it came out of nowhere. The plot headed in a completely different direction with Bowie/John M.I.A. in the second half of the movie.Some other things were happening in the second half of the movie with no clear explanation for what was going on, but by that time, I didn't care anymore. Too bad, this had the potential to be a cult classic."
1,Below par special effects + No suspense + Choppy flow + Wooden Acting = A huge waste of money and time,"This movie was released almost 30 years ago and it shows its age. The special effects look like those of today TV shows. I mean they look obviously fake. There`s no suspense. The flow is choppy. The acting is wooden. Some scenes look more like a musical show than a movie. I mean they look beautiful but they had no substance. In short, this is a huge waste of money and time."
3,Zero plot- otherwise enjoyable,"David Bowie as the aging vampire, Willem Dafoe as the street thug, Bauhaus in concert at the beginning, Catherine Deneuve and Sarandon in bed together- essentially, the film is a good collection of flashy shots. I like it in spite of myself."
4,Almost Perfect,"I was looking for a remote PowerPoint presentation controller but all the dedicated ones I found had too little power and their built-in laser pointer drained the batteries much too quickly. If I was going to use a separate laser pointer anyway, I may as well get a controller to use for other things as well - like a small RF mouse! This one looked great because it was small and had good range. However, if you look at the USB cable you'll see it only has two conductors - Power and Ground. It is used for charging ONLY. You cannot use this mouse as a normal USB mouse. It ONLY works through the RF dongle. Yes you can use the mouse while charging, but the RF dongle needs to be plugged in. On a long plane trip, this just adds to the battery drain. This seems like a silly design limitation to me. I give it only 4 stars because an RF mouse with a USB cable should be operational as a USB mouse when plugged in."
1,Sole fell apart,"I bought these from Champs and had about 2 weeks of wear. The rubber sole is thin on the ball of the foot and it split apart. Champs looked at them and declined a refund. This is not considered a manufacturer defect. So if you want to spend a 100.00 for a few weeks wear....go ahead. The Tornado 3 sole is completely redesigned with a more substantial rubber layer. Do you think they realized this was a problem with the Tornado 2????? Very unhappy with this Mizuno product and Champs response.3 days after listing this review, Champs decided to give a full refund. So I do sincerely appreciate their ""new and improved"" response. Thanks Kim!!! I still recommend the Tornado 3 instead....you will get better wear on the sole."
5,works great,"I lost the little charger attachment piece for my Rino, so I was unable to charge the battery. Although I did not need a new cord, this set has been a ""lifesaver"" for me. Absolutely no problems with this product."
5,Excellent program for someone with some basic French.,"I loved this program. I had taken French thirty years ago for a semester and a couple of adult education courses before starting. The CDs have learning tools for comprehension, vocabulary, present and past tense, speaking and dictation. It uses a video to begin the lesson with both spoken and written dialogue. One can follow along with the written until familiar. The lessons build on the video. There are different games to improve skills and exercises that require one to repeat words, rearrange sentences, fill in blanks, match words for meaning, and answer questions. The variety kept me interested. There are tools to assess how well one is doing. I would highly recommend it for someone with some basic vocabulary and verbs."
2,not firm at all,"i got this thinking it'd be a good option instead of packing up (and possibly losing) my pair of goosebumps, but this is definitely not comparable. while it's prickly (which is good), the ball feels like it's not fully inflated, so i'm not getting a strong massage when i'm rolling it under my aching feet. so disappointing. guess i'll be picking up another pair of goosebumps after all."
2,A little too sharp,I think the spikes on the ball are a little too pointy. I have used other balls for foot massage that I think are a lot more suitable...
1,Spikey/painful,"SPIKEY AND PAINFUL TO THE BARE FEET. I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING TO BE SOFTER. AGAIN, IT FELT LIKE NEEDLES ON THE BOTTOM OF MY FEET. NOT SOOTHING AS I WANTED IT TO BE FOR MY VERY TIRED FEET."
2,Very hard to press,"I bought it because I have pain in my arm because of working long hours on computer. But did not find it very useful. It is hard to press the ball. I expected it to be suited for massage so I could press more confortably. But since it is so hard, I am not using it much."
3,May not be fair to the product,"Believe it or not, I ordered this product for our dog. When we got her, she brought her favorite toy (a blue ball similar to this one). I wanted to make sure that she had more when her favorite one wore out. Not only does she keep it with her faithfully, but she loves to play catch with it at every chance. However, it turns out that the one that she had was actually one of the dryer balls. So this one here was too large and too hard on her teeth to catch. So, I don't feel that my opinion would be fair to the product."
4,Good saw,"I like this saw very much, bought it for one job that had seven doorways for 250' of tiling in a kitchen/entryway. Worth every cent for this one use. Makes accurate cuts quickly, can't wait to need it again! I suggest an extra blade on hand for those sneaky finish nails you might miss in the door jamb that can dull your blade. Smooth operating, 4 stars for room for improvement."
4,The Massacre in Gish,"In Blood Brothers, Abuna mentions the massacre/mass grave in Gish very briefly. Abuna's motivation has been, and continues to be the search (and work) for peace. Yet there are those who dispute him because the truth is too hard to swallow. Abuna does not write a polemic and is not apologetic in his views. He simply and deeply wants peace. I am not a religious person at all, but I am from Gish. Members of my family in 1948 were instructed by jewish soldiers to collect the dead bodies from roof tops and narrow alleys and move them to the mass burial place in Gish. All of us kids [of Gish] knew where that spot was and we never played near it. Some people will accept the truth only when it fits their beliefs. But unless we learn from history and come to terms with certain atrocities (both palestinian and israeli), peace has no chance."
4,Oldies but Goodies!,"When I bought this video I wasn't to keen on getting ""Golden Oldies"" performances! But anyway I pressed on and watched it, and I loved it. Now it is one of my favorite skating videos that I own, and I have to watch it at least once a month! My favorite performances on the tape are Torvill&Dean's comic tango, and Scott Hamilton's When I'm 64, routine!"
4,Great Performances/Bad Audio,"This is a great collection of performances by some of history's greatist skaters.If you can get past the beginning,I'm sure you'll enjoy this video.An awful,loud and annoying announcer is heard during the first couple of performances with the music being very low.Afterwards,things pick up.Former skater,Jo Jo Starbuck does a very nice job commenting.Video quality is very good,especially for the age of some of the footage.All performances are firt rate.A nice surprise for me was a routine by Rosalyn Sumners,who was not listed on the video package.She is one of my all-time favorites.This is a must have for all long time figure skating fans."
3,The Spy who came from the Cold,"The Spy who came in from the Cold is a great movie, maybe Richard Burtons best. However, I do not like the closed caption."
4,"Dark , brooding and ironic ,","The Spy Who Came In From The Cold is a dark brooding spy saga about Alec Leamas (Richard Burton), a burned out, cynical, alcoholic and rather depressed former MI 5 agent, who has been `discharged' from the service.Working in a library, he forms a romance with Nan Perry (Claire Bloom), a young English librarian, who finds meaning in her life, with doctrinaire Communist views, and her activities in the British Communist Party.Leamas is later asked by the service to help cover for a East German spy, secretly working for the British, and is asked to make contact with East German agents in Holland, before being taken back to Berlin.A rather ironic and slow moving film, with some brilliant dialogue and little action.The end gives some more ironic evidence of how the Communists devour their own , how those who devote their lives to `The Party' often end up as it's victims."
2,Hard to follow,Couldn't understand the dialogue due to the British accents.Very difficult to follow. Didn't mind the black and white butthey should have had sub-titles for Americans.
2,"Not a great book, worse movie","I didn't like the Le Carre book. I liked this movie less. My issues are probably more related to the genre than this particular work. I just don't understand why people are so fascinated with spy novels. I've never been that mesmerized by savvy people playing it close to the vest and by endless treachery. The only enjoyment I get out of these types of works is related to the geography, history, and politics that form the settings."
1,Disapointing,"The authors seemed to have rushed this, and so did the proof readers. There are several mistakes in the Q&A sections, and some areas that are treated quite superficially. I suspect that there are some gaps in the authors' knowledge - this may explain confusing and at times incorrect statements in the text, such as their explanation of VTP Pruning. Look around, I'm sure you'll find better than this."
1,Book has several errors and the test is plagued with errors.,"I would be careful when reading this book there are several errors, and if you don't know what you are doing I wouldn't even bother using the self test as it will put incorrect answers in your head. There are at least five questions that are just obviously wrong. If you take the self test I would go over to CCO online, and verify that any answer the software gives you is correct. I am amazed that they allowed so many errors to make it into the final pressing of the CD."
4,"Easy to follow, but lacks detail","This book is not very in depth. Some of the important topics are covered very poor. If you really want to know the stuff and pass the BCMSN exam, get the Cisco press book on the same topic.Happy studying."
5,Must have,"This is a must have for winter fun in the snow. Very durable, hard plastic. Many kids will enjoy making the snowballs."
5,Great Toy!!!,"We have truly enjoyed this toy! Very easy for my 5 and 3 year old boys to use. It makes such a great snowball, we have since ordered more!"
5,AMAZING!,"THIS ALBUM IS AMAZING> AND EVERYONE ELSE THAT HAS BEEN GIVING IT A 1 STAR IS JUST UPSET BECAUSE SHE IS THE BIGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGEST SELLING FEMALE OF ALL TIME! AND DONT FORGET ABOUT US IS GOING TO BE HER 17th NUMBER ONE SINGLE! MORE THAN ANY OTHER FEMALE EVER! SO MADONNA FANS>.... DONT HATE CAUSE MADONNA CANT SING!! SHE COMES OUT WITH CLUB MUSIC CAUSE HER VOICE SUCKS!!!! SHES LOST IT 10 YEARS AGO! GET OVER IT! AND J Lo FANS! PLEASE!!!! J LO CANT SING EITHER! HER ALBUM 'REBIRTH"" ONLY SOLD 700,000 COPIES IN THE USA! HAHAHAH THATS A JOKE!-Marjan"
1,Cliché is written all over the album.,"The new songs included in the (originally fabulous) ""Emancipation of Mimi"" should be considered as old songs, not new. Mariah Carey brings once again more of the same which bores pretty fast, if you buy it, it will be for a very short term usage then you'll be wanting to get rid of it as soon as possible."
1,The Sound is outdated,"And the album being at place 49 of sales (at the date that this review is written) is the evidence.Also, it's a very cheap move to make a 4th re-release of the same old album with just crappy remixes that sound like the original themes."
1,Career Suicide?,Alot of us were thrilled to see Mariah back on top after years of releasing flops. It was like watching a phoneix rise from the ashes. Now its like watching an ungrateful glutton going on a rampage re-releasing the same album over and over just to garner more sales. Using your fans and their love of you just to make more money and sell more. You should be ashamed.
1,greedy pig or cash cow? BOTH!,mariah is one greedy pig who prances around like a cow and wants more money in her piggy bank so she rereleases the best selling album of the year just to get more sales because she's afraid of having another breakdown. Don't fall for the hype just buy the original mimi if you must it was a great album...until now
1,Mariah Scarey doesn't care about her fans.,"Well done, Mariah, for making all the 4 million people who bought your successful comeback, buy it all over again."
1,Desperate attempt for more sales,"I nearly bought ""The Emancipation of Mimi"" the original version... until i heard one particular song a few thousand times too much!! Yuck!! The rest of the album is filled with horrible production, wailing, and rent-a-rappers.And this steaming pile of you-know-what is just a desperate attempt to get Mariah to acheive Diamond status in the U.S.IT AIN'T GONNA HAPPEN!!"
1,"Way to go, Mariah.","This is yet another cash-in. The Mariah fans, and her lambs, should just be honest. The original edition of The Emancipation Of Mimi has gone platinum four times over in America, so way to go, Mariah. Why? For making all the people who contributed to your SUCCESSFUL comeback, buy it all again. As I said, way to go. I LIKE this album. When you think about it, Don't Forget About Us is already available as a single, and there are similar versions of We Belong Together out there. Finally, when she releases a music videos collection on DVD, the four music videos included here, will be on that. Cash-in? Yes, certainly.AAAAAND.......for the record, Madonna is the QUEEN OF POP. Madonna has also sold more records. Period.As for The Emancipation Of Mimi, just keep on buying the already-successful original edition, and maybe that will teach her a lesson."
1,Most returned album,I work at a record store and this album gets returned on a daily basis from people who are so dissapointed in it. Dont be fooled like these people were.
5,It's not a comeback...,"People use to criticize Mariah'a albums from 2001 until 2004.But they never heard Charmbracelet's wonderful songs, nor have they realized how Glitter is a nice album. Okay, a horrible sequencing, but, nevertheless, it's a SOUNDTRACK ALBUM, it was made to fill the movie's needs. Guess if you first listen to Glitter and watch the movie later, you will like it.But we are here to talk about the Emancipation of MIMI.Great songs... But SO LONELY is definately the greatest song EVER! Though I prefer Twista's The Day After's version, I found myself amazed with the new lyrics. Anyway, this is the BEST ALBUM OF '05 AND IT WILL REMAIN THE BEST UNTIL SHE RELEASES ANOTHER ONE."
5,MARIAH IS DA BEST,DIS REPACKAGED CD IS AWSOME. NOT ONLY DO U GET DA 4 BONUS AWSOME TRACKS BUT DA DVD WITH 4 VIDEOS AND A WEB LINK WITH DA DONT FORGET ABOUT US VIDEO PLUS AN INTERVIEW. LUVZ IT.
1,We'er so glad U2 upset this skank,"Blue Racer: Mariah Carey is one ugly tramp and only came back as her label people paid radio to play her but the great U2 upstaged her. Japanese Beetle: Serpent son, this woman makes Yoko Ono look like one talented woman and if I saw Mariah I'd karate chop her. Blue Racer: I hate every song like Don't Forget About Us, We Belong Together and It's Like That. Japanese Beetle: I would chop her up LIKE THAT, HAASAH(chops Mariah CD in half and bows). Sayonara!"
4,I like this one!,"It's great to see that in this edition you will own a few more songs and video as well but I hope that Mariah also can do the same thing to her Charmbracelet album. I just hope that Mariah will re-released her Charmbracelet which will includes a few extra her songs such as there goes my heart, got a thing 4 you, miss you and i know what you want and videos such as through the rain, boy I need you, bringin' on the heartbreak and I know what you want. If she can do to the Emancipation of Mimi, why not Charmbracelet?"
1,CRAP,"Unless you REALLY like (you must be crazy if you do) such lyric GEMS (yeah, right) like ""Them chickensis ash and I'm lotion Baby come and get it""Don't buy it not even if it's the last thing you do on your life. But J'Lo instead."
1,Greedy Ass B*tch,"Get the **** outta here. Mariah is the best selling female artist of all time but she's re-releasing an album that is like 5 million platium, are you serious? Honey how much money do you wanna steal from people to be satisfy? I can expect something like this from Usher but Mariah come on. She gets a little success and she goes overboard."
1,Yoga Nidra Meditation Dr. John Mumford,"Contents of practice is useful. However, the tape recording of the practice is ancient. Not easy to understand which spoils the entire process. I would only recommend this for people looking for some inspiration in their practice but not to use as a tool of practice."
2,"an anecdotal collection, no ""true scientific research"" here","One of the first clarions of the so-called computer ""Productivity Paradox"", this report is often cited by other unsubstantiated, anecdotal ""studies"". But there is no ""true scientific research"" here. Written in 1994 (or '93), published in 1995 (with the fourth printing in ""97), it must necessarily ignore the enormous impact of the Web. And like similar tales of ""Productivity Paradox"" it fundamentally ignores that their incorrect conclusions are based on more than twenty five years of data ""category error"" (insufficient definitions). Hence the recent NAICS data corrections reflect the enormous economic impact that previously was denied."
1,Not what you think it is...,"It was a very uncomfortable experience for me to have read this book (In truth I read forty pages) because I was totally unaware of this subculture on the Internet. Maybe the intent of the author was to inform and to poke fun of this odd group of social misfits but to me, as a parent of two late teenage boys, it was a wakeup call to pay more attention to their Internet habits. While it may be entertaining to some it was not very funny to find out how easy it is to find predator-like weasels out there just waiting to engage in a written format with anyone who has time to waste and has humans they so want to find and peform perveted garbage in font of. I cannot recommend this to anyone who has any kind of intelligence. Do not get this idiocy! Maybe the police or NBC Dateline will perhaps find this more interesting than the book reading pblic."
2,oh come on...,"[...]This Internet ""dating"" book is not good, is not well written and is very short sighted on intelligent commentary or dare I say...humor. And just because the author uses a caveat to dispose of his il-literal inabilities, so what? Just because I can write a review does that now mean I can get published? I'll run right out and get some software to do just that.What then is its purpose? I DID date this guy. He DID show me the method with which he used to gather and 'create' his `wonderful' thesis and IT is bad. [...]"
4,"Cute, silly, sexy, not a Pulitzer award!","I guess since I'd never heard of the author previously, that this would be his first effort at writing a novel. It shows, but to be fair he states that ""this is no literary work of art.""Despite that obvious deficiency the book has a nice flow, has some hilarious moments (some that are painfully similar to my own misadventures) and chapter ten left me shaken, stirred, and wet in dubious locales.While I might not recommend Interknot to my book of the month club, I do sincerely recommend it to all who have sailed the gritty waters of internet dating, or any who would dare to in the future.Not too bad at all sir."
3,herbal know-how,"Susun Weed's book about herbs and the ""Childbearing Year"" left me with more questions than answers. I feel that it is not for someone beginning to take an interst in herbs in pregnancy."
5,"Excellent Resource! A ""MUST OWN""","We have found that the Warehouse & Logistics Software Directory to be extremely helpful. It is a thorough list of what WMS solutions are out there making it unique from the small lists of WMS software that one can ind here or there. Since the directory has WMS listings by operating system, it was easy for us to focus on both Unix & NT solutions. A big time saver!"
3,"Instructions could be better, some damage, critical unprepared pieces","*** If you don't have some assembly experience, a drill, and ""know how"", I'm not sure you should get this one. ***Another reviewer seems to complain about the same thing: The upright board behind the three drawers is not possible to install by using the pieces as-is and following the instructions. Three (pieces) are not prepared properly. I had to drill my own 2 holes in one piece--luckily you can use another piece as a template. Two other pieces should have pilot holes. You will not be able to put this together with only the tools provided.Also one hidden part was broken off and I was required to leave a shelf bracket in a pretty shoddy state. It should work fine, but again if you're not handy this might cause you grief."
3,So/So product.,As has been said the instructions are far from the best I have ever seen. They tell you to use pins in places there are no holes for pins and in the case of two screws they actually tell you to use the wrong screw. There was some minor damage to of the pieces mostly in places that are not seen but there is a gouge in the top back rail that kind of bugs me but does not affect the product. Again not a terrible product but I would probably pay a few more bucks for a better one if I had it to do again. Although I was able to put it together with only the included tool and a phillips screw driver. No problems with the holes not lining up or needing to drill.
3,Missing magic,"Like Eno himself described it, this album lacks the magic and inspiration of their first two collaborations. What was revolutionary and avant-garde in the 70's is no longer fascinating today. More reminiscent of Fripp's solo work, this album mixes both his early guitar styles and the newer 'Soundscapes' which I was fortunate enough to experiment live on his solo tour a few years ago.The first five tracks are excellent, subtle, mysterious and appealing. The latest two tracks should have been left off or replaced by better performances."
1,Nothing at all like the originals,"I absolutely love ""No Pussyfooting"" and ""Evening Star"", which are two of my all-time favorite albums. This album, however, is nothing at all like them, and is truly boring and unengaging. Extremely disappointing. Anyone who says otherwise is a mindless zombie that can't keep themselves from buying music with Fripp and Eno's names on it. Unfortunately, I am also one of those people, except for the mindless part..."
1,Less than Ambient,"What do you do when Ambient Music seems too loud? Try this. This recording sets a new standard for Minimalism. There's so little here to listen to, that it's impossible to become engaged with it on any level, not even as ""background music"". For two talented artists, this is a very lazy effort, and an insult to their audience."
1,So boring,I couldn't even finish this movie it was so boring. Also alot of the guys in it sound like they are full of bunk. One person in the doc said his cousin lost 100 lbs by taking 12 dumps a day and in one day lost 15 lbs. PICS OR IT DIDN'T HAPPEN.
2,Propagandistic,"The approach is too agenda laden. It was not a balanced view. Rather, it proselytzes, ""raw food is good because enzymes are there...."" Well, foodborne pathogens are one reason we must cook food, so we can avoid death and severe pain.It is so biased that I don't think any fence sitter would be convinced to join. Rather, it turns me off.The purpose must be to preach to the choir. Really, it is so pushy that it is not persuasive."
5,Great DVD,"Actually watched it already, but wanted to get my own copy to share with others as I teach about healthily living... A must see for all the health conscious..."
1,I got burned,I bought this trusting its saying that they have the best method and did not learn anything before giving up. I also bought it in a store and was not allowed to return it because of their crapy return policy (I am now considering a boycott of Best Buy). I am looking for a program that will teach someone who has no knowledge of Spanish at all. If you know of this please email me at Benny365@hotmail.comThanksBen
2,Pricey and Boring,"This book is very difficult to understand because of how the author word's her sentences. She should use simpler terms instead. She also writes it so boringly. This book isn't much of a help, although there are good references of the faery times and dates and the times of the archangels etc.You would think that a book that is called 'Fairy Spells' would actually give you spells. This book doesn't really give you enough spells to actually be a spellbook. The spells are very complicated and need herbs and items that are hard to get your hands on.[...]The art on the other hand is very beautiful and colorful. I think the best part of this book is the art. Just the cover has a beautiful faery holding a wand. Look inside for more pretty fae pictures. Because of the beautiful pictures, I give this book 2 stars, or I would have given only 1."
2,Look before you leap,"This book was very disappointing. Much like the title says, this book is a jumpstart. A jump into ASP.net but you the reader better start MSDN to look up fixes and explanations of best practices. I have been using asp.net for 3 months and was looking for a book that would help me establish good coding techniques and explain the Microsoft recommended ways of using this new technology. This book is not it. I can say that the guy on the cover is how I felt after reading this book, and it was a bad landing.Try reading Microsoft Asp.Net Step by Step instead."
2,SAMPLES DONT WORK,"The book looks great, however when you download the samples and install everything, you get errors, and errors, If you write them and ask for help, you will lose your time. I prefer use CD ROM next time."
1,Product DOA,"This product was designed well and would have been exactly what I needed. UNFORTUNATELY, It was shipped already damaged from Amazon. This was not damaged during shipping, but BEFORE it was packed. I can not believe that someone would pack this away in this condition. It was the last one that they had in that model...I wonder why?But, Amazon did make good by issuing a full refund promptly and sent me my second choice from Plano, a different manufacturer. I wish the first one wasn't broken. It would have better served my needs as I don't really like the new one."
2,Where to go?,"This software is confusing. For beginners it is difficult to know which direction to go in, as there are many. Clicking on the introduction icon resulted in continuous recording without an exit except the escape key. Also, although the speech was in English, the examples were in French. It was very hard for us to understand the concept of how to use the software, without regard to the language. Our experience with the Learning Company on language is much more straight forward and easier to comprehend."
1,How sad.,"I've been waiting months for my computer to be set up so I could get to work on learning Italian; something I've wanted to do forever. What a tremendous disapointment it was. They need to just skip over or toss out that ""Beginner"" fantasy. I've never been moved to review anything before, but this disapointment has got me typing. I just wish I had read the reviews before my impulse purchasing at the store.If you are a beginner, move along, nothing to see here. Find something a little more beginner friendly. Or a LOT more."
4,Very Complit,It is a great instrument for starters in this world of cocktails... is very helpful and I am enjoy every minut of it.
1,This book is awful,"This book is not funny. I was appalled when I saw the title of the book. People don't seem to think twice about bashing males. What if we change ""boys"" are stupid to Gays, mexicans, girls. How many people would be laughing about that. I don't think many would."
4,Like being born inside a warm melon,"my ears have yet to taste the ""smoke"" but if it smells anything finer than carbootrack #5 then I will surely have tiedied and gone to heavenly :o"
1,To little for a dvd,"...two shows on a disc is not enough. Tapes could only hold somuch, and so can dvds but I'm sorry, anyone who buys these are gettingripped off. The Stand miniseries is on one disc for pete's sake. You could easily fit the ENTIRE series in say a five disc set. Honestly...Even a hard core fan isn't going to buy every episode on dvd when only two episodes are on it a piece. But even a casual fan couldn't resist the entire series in a box set of only a few discs... Hardcore fans already have the shows on tape, and new fans don't waste your time. Watch the re-runs. END"
1,There are 40 volumes?,That's $800! Who thought of that? Bad! There needs to be a box set! Who would buy all of these? It's absurd! I love the show but I have to give this collection a low rating.
1,NOT ENOUGH SHOWS!!,"I love this show and have all the episodes on tape from Columbia House...but I can't bring myself to buy these dvds. Yes I want them badly, but TWO episodes per disc?????? I'll wait till they bring them out in complete seasons, or when ever I hit the lottery."

5,Fahey's masterpiece,"That John Fahey considered Volume 1 of this project more than just a Christmas album when it was first released in 1968 was evident from his liner notes, which linked its purpose to the writings of historian and theologian Paul Tillich. A Volume 2 was recorded a few years later, but the original recordings soon went out of print and Fahey confused the issue by re-recording and re-issuing the original titles some years after that in completely inferior versions. This cd release resurrects the original recordings, and we should all be very grateful! This is a great classic of the solo acoustic guitar, not to mention Christmas music, and it warms one's heart to listen to it year after year, knowing that one can, when all is said and done, yet ignore the tons of schmaltz that is always being foisted on us in the name of commercialism and nostalgia. Only people with little imagination could not like this wonderful work."
1,Do Not Buy This Book,"This book is dangerous and filled very bad, dangerous advice. It was written in 1998, so giving the benefit of the doubt, perhaps our thinking about homing a rescue dog has evolved, but this book is extremely outdated. It recommends using the dog's crate as a place for punishment -which we all know is wrong. It further recommends ""pops"" with the leash to jerk your dog into obedience and ""staring down"" a dog into submission -again, outdated, inappropriate concepts. It is a very high level, superficial, quick read riddled with inappropriate advice that certainly does not speak to how one goes about brining a new, most likely scared, rescue dog into your home."
5,Second Hand Dog,"Such a sweet sensitive book for parents or would be parents of a second hand dog. It reminds us that this special dog had a previous life before he met you,and so to be extra patient and loving with him. I highly recommend reading this."
5,An Accidental Engagement,"Back cover reads:While she was sleeping...Claire Farley wakes in hospital to find her memory has deserted her. Yet the biggest shock is her discovery that she's wearing a diamond engagement ring! Claire's fiance is the wonderful Tye Kershaw--he's perfect husband material: caring, kind, not to mention handsome!She accidently got engagedBut when Claire's memory floods back there's one peice of the jigsaw that doesn't slot into place--she's never, ever laid eyes on Tye before. So why is she now living in his house, wearing his ring--and sharing his bed...?"
3,Way cool alarm clock,"For $20 here's a nice looking clock that always keeps exact time and projects red LED-looking time on the wall or ceiling.Way cool! - even cooler: you can rotate the projected display with the click of a buttonOn the negative side - the controls are cheapo and not very intuitive, plus the instructions seem to have lost a little in translationWay negative: OK, the snooze bar works intuitively, but how do you finally turn off the alarm? It says to push any button, but I can tell you pulling the power plug works just fine - then on the plus side again, when you plug it back in you don't have to set the time - it automatically sets itself"
4,Great Features,"This alarm clock has some nice features. It has two separate alarms, and each one makes a different buzzing noise. It also tells the temp., and shows different time zones. The only draw back, as other reviews have pointed out, is it does not project well with light. This doesn't matter in the night, but in the morning it would be nice."
3,"A good premise, but...","I have to say, I thought I'd really enjoy this book. It seemed to have a lot of the kind of stories I like, about exotic countries and adventures. The stories themselves were very good, I can't say believable, because they weren't, but they are all true. It is organized roughly chronilogically, but in places it tends to bounce around a little.I thought his descriptions of life in the book were excellent, and often hilarious. Especially about the car trip, (hark to all kids who have mother's who love to grip handles when the fathers speed)! However, for some reason, I couldn't get into this book. It took me over a month, in between reading about 10 other books, to finish it! Maybe it is because it is divided into about 16 unrelated stories and I tend to like books that flow, rather than short stories. Anyway, it's a good read if you like this sort of thing, and worth a try to anyone!"
4,It is a good book for the Neurology Boards,"It is a concise neuroanatomy book for neurology Board prep. The strength of this book comes from the discussion of cases presented following each section, making it easier to memorize. Rote is made palatable, thanks to this brain-wave."
4,well written with some slammin' tracks,"Although he has sampled some oldies but goodies, Montel has written another good album. My favorite Montel J. song was ""What's on tonight"", but now it's definitely ""When you get home"", that song is soooooo butta! I wish he had chosen some more well known rap artists from the East coast , to also appear on his album."
3,A good reference book,"Even though this book was very good in it's reference stylings, the pictures would be an insult to any Shar-pei lover. Not only are they black and white, so you can't tell the color of the animal; the pictures are not even clear enough to see the animal."
4,Hits the Perfect Chord,"I've always enjoyed reading stories that are off-center, but still depict a hidden reality. The main character, Peter Woody, is a very strange and very realistic character. His journey through this story reminds me of a Charlie Chaplin movie--humorous but tragic also. And the writing has a touch of ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" to it. No doubt Peter Woody and Dr. Hunter S. Thompson would be partying buddies. The drug and sex scenes are shocking, but in the very best way--to be read over and over. That's what I plan to do."
2,Disappointing,"This book is nowhere close to the original ""Stick Fighting."" It seems that it is attempting to pry into on the reputation of the former book. When comparing the two books, this should not be entitled ""Stick Fighting 2"" but something completely different. Buy it only if you plan to sell it later or are adding it to a Hatsumi collection."
1,A True Master of Deception,"Hatsumi does it again. As the quintessential master of smoke and mirrors, Hatsumi once again attempts to sell nothing as something. What else can be expected from the self-procaimed master of kyojitsu tenkan-ho?"
2,Great Photos - Shame About The Writing,"As a photo-filled scrapbook of an unexpectedly magical season, SOUTH SIDE HITMEN will definitely jog some happy memories for Sox fans who were there in '77. Unfortunately, Helpingstine's writing is clumsy, repetitive and not particularly insightful, and his interviews with former players Steve Stone, Oscar Gamble and Goose Gossage seem to have produced little of value -- which is odd, since those guys were some of the most interesting and opinionated players from that era. Also, this book really needed an editor; not only is the same picture of Bill Veeck and Bob Lemon run twice, but misspellings abound. Was Reggie Jackson really a ""Marquis player""? Was Jim Essian really traded to the A's for Pablo ""Rorrealba""? Also, that ""Red Sox player"" posing with Reggie Jackson and Richie Zisk at the '77 All Star game is quite obviously Carl Yastrzemski..."
3,In need of update,"I find the guide useful in my recent travel to Tunisia but many places need updating, particularly the ""where to stay"" and ""where to eat"" sections the comments in which I find run-of-the-mill and, in some cases, outdated, e.g. one hotel was closed down more than a year ago despite its mentioning in the guide. I find these two sections disappointing."
4,great plot,"Although I wouldn't recommend this for an introduction to Agatha Christie (try Ten Little Indians, Murder in Mesopotamia, The Murder of Roger Ackroyd) I think that the twist at the end is one of her most believable. As Poirot says, everything clicks into place. I agree with another reviewer that the beginning isn't that great, Mrs. Oliver saying she suspects something, but I think it DOES work for the book's atmosphere of something faintly wrong about Nasse House. I love the ending. It's so much more centered around the characters and the character of Mrs. Folliat is very touching. The comic relief also works: Mrs. Oliver, the ""bloodhound-like"" Mrs. Masterton and her husbands' horsy agent Captain Warbuton are nice touches, as are the hapless girls from the hostel and the foreigner-hating Constable Hoskins."
5,A Masterpiece At Your Fingertips!,"Agatha Christie at her very best! Once you pick up the book you just won't be able to put it down. It starts off a little slow, but once Poirot arrives at Nassecombe (the setting of the crime) the excitement and intrigue really begins! Just when you think you know 'whodunnit' Ms. Christie turns the tables on you. It's a total thrill-ride and will have you begging for more! If you only read one Agatha Christie book this is the one!"
4,This writer is always solid,"This was a typical book for this author, which is a pretty good thing. Her stories aren't especially gripping but she always delivers a nice love story, this time about a male firefighter and a divorcee who previously has only married/dated wealthy men. There is also a very good teenage daughter in this book who also needs the firefighter's help and affection and a great dog."
1,Poor design,Cleaning it every time after #2 is just getting old. Problem is worse when child using it. I searched online to find a solution on how to raise water level in a basin and no luck. Tried adjusting water level in a tank to a max and still same issue. This is just poor design and there is no way to fix it. I have other Toto models and they work great but this one I would never recommend to anyone unless you enjoy cleaning your toilet on a daily basis.
5,Great Toilet!,"Everyone agrees that the Aquia III Dual Max Toilet is a great new addition to our home. I got the soft close seat as well and it fits PERFECTLY (contrary to others' reviews, it is exactly as pictured and fits the unit just right). My installer had some stress figuring out how to put it in but by the end was convinced he needed to go order one for himself! One note of caution: If you have a wood floor (mine is in a powder room), be aware you may have a small area to sand/refinish because of the change of the base shape from a previous standard toilet. Also be aware that the height is higher than an old ""standard"" size (could impact wall hangings/ shelves if anything hung/attached to wall above the old toilet) Worth minor repairs to a fancy wood floor for the addition of this upscale toilet! Amazon.com free ship and no sales tax -- made the entire experience flawless. I would DEFINITELY buy this again."
3,Not the best use of your money,"No doubt this WGBH documentary can be an eye-opener for people who have not had a chance to hear about the last 20 years of brain research, but as a teacher who works with children with learning differences, my advice is to spend your money on one of Mel Levine's books (One Mind at a Time or The Myth of Laziness). That way you'll actually get some concrete advice instead of just hearing about how bad it's been for other families. And you won't have to watch a doctor tell distraught parents that if they don't put their 11 year old daughter on Ritalin she'll probably grow up to be a drug addict."
2,please press stop,"If I wasn't sure untill now if it was time for the old rockers to bow down and let the younger generation face the crowds I do now, thanks to ""Just Push Play"".After listening to sticky sweet pop melodies such as ""avant garden"" or ""sunshine"" I feel that Aerosmith have forgotten what music, espacialy rock music is all about.It sounds as if the guys just made the c.d to sell- it's a well edited replica of the recent pop trash that has been comming out lately. It's too bad Aerosmith couldn't take going out with a bang -before ""just push play""..."
2,Walk Away!! Walk Away! From this one!,"Aerosmith has proven they have lost their edge. Everyone saw it coming when they sold out to play the Superbowl with N'Sync and Britney Spears. And just like that Aerosmith sold out. In all honesty, theit last good album was Pump. There are about two decent tracks on Just Push PLay but the overall sound is very hollow. There is just something missing. It could be that musical integrity thing. But there is something missing on this album. Their last few albums have been going south but this one hits rock bottom. Most of the songs all blend in together and you can't tell song from song. Lyrically it's bland as well. With such songs from albums like Toys In The Attic, Pump, and Permanant Vacation, The Album Just Push Play doesn't have one song good enough for a classis Aerosmith album."
4,AEROSMITH STILL HAVE IT!,"I DON'T WANT TO BORE YOU WITH A LONG REVIEW. I AM A HUGE FAN OF 1970'S AEROSMITH & ""ROCK AND A HARD PLACE"" & ""DONE WITH MIRRORS"". ON ""PERMANENT VACATION"" THEY STARTED TO LOSE THE CLASSIC SOUND. YOU HAD A FEW CHOICE CUTS AND THAT'S IT. THE NEXT ALBUMS TO FOLLOW ALSO HAD JUST A FEW SONGS TO SATISFY THE CLASSIC ROCKER. ""JUST PUSH PLAY"" IS GREAT. OUT OF 12 SONGS, 2 DON'T CUT IT. ""FLY AWAY FROM HERE"" & ""LUV LIES"" I CAN SKIP OVER. EVERYTHING ELSE IS GREAT. A TOUCH OF PYSCHADELIA AND A LOT OF CLASSIC AEROSMITH ROCK. IF YOU DON'T OWN THIS AND HAVE ALL OF THE OTHER CLASSIC ""'SMITH"", GET THIS ONE NOW. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME."
4,New Sound For The Boston Boys,"Well, Steven said in a recent interview that this was their greatest album yet, I still have to hold them to ""Pump"" as their greatest. However, ""Just Push Play"" is not to far behind. The sound is very different from their past work. It sounds like that they are trying to go with a kind of a ""Nine Inch Nails"" industrial sound. From what I have heard so far most the songs are pretty ""raw"", while there are a few on there that are kinda new. But i guess that they have to make the album appealabe to the younger crowds as well as the older."
4,Not Their Best,"First of all, this is not their best album. Honestly, I enjoy their older songs and style. But the album is still good. It's not as hard as previous albums, but it has good lyrics if you really listen. In my opinion, Jaded is not the best song on the album. Fly Away From Here and Luv Lies are both better, in sound and lyrics. Aerosmith's sound is definitely changing, in some ways for the better, some ways for the worse. But overall, not a bad album."
5,One of the best Aerosmith works ever!!,"I absolutely LOVE this album! Aerosmith has once again redefined their style to fit the times, and this is their best ever. Some of the songs are absolutely moving. Just Fly Away almost made me cry because it was so beautiful. Most of the songs are totally unlike previous Aerosmith songs so it's a totally new experience. I've seen this album compared to Get a Grip, but it blows Get a Grip out the door. I never thought I would like a modern Aerosmith album over one of their 70s albums, but Just Push Play is the exception. In a time when rock is threatening to die, Just Push Play is a much-needed awakening."
4,Let the Consistency Continue,"This may not have as many guitar-charged rockers as ""Nine Lives"" but it more than makes up for that with its infectious tunes. What I like most about this album is how happy the band sounds doing their thing. In that sense, it's their best since ""Pump."" With brilliantly executed tracks like the title track, Fly Away From Here, Sunshine, and Avant Garden, this album forces you to pick a new favorite song every day. I like to put the groups albums into three phases; The Strictly Rock Years(Self-titled-Done With Mirrors), the Rock-Pop Years(Permanent Vacation-Pump), and the hybrid years(Nine Lives, JPP).This album definitely shows the band experimenting yet still not forgetting about their roots. A listening pleasure."
1,One of the worst albums of the year,"Give me a break. Aerosmith rapping? This is a poor excuse for a pop-album.First you see Aerosmith perform with Britney Spears and all sorts of other rappers, now this.. Hello ""sell-out""This album is full of bad filler music. go spend your money on something worthwhile that you'll play more than 2 times"
1,"Aerosmith said, ""Let's 'just push trash' on people to make a buck.""","This is so not Aerosmith. How could ""America's Greatest Rock 'n' Roll Band"" sell out and go pop? This is really sad. The music is poor and unoriginal.In addition, it's not just me who believes this CD is no good. I tried to take it to a local used CD store and recoop something from my loss. The guy at the shop wouldn't even take it off my hands. He said, ""Sorry, it's not worth anything.""So Aerosmith pushed this trash on the music world. But now, at least there's one more copy of this CD sitting where it belongs. Don't buy this CD, buy something from their pre-corrupton days."
5,Just Push Play-Aerosmith,"This cd is so up beat, rock me out. The entire band is so connection to each other. Steve's voice is wonderful and those solo guitar licks by Joe are out of this world. That cd keeps me so uplifted and feeling sooo good!"
3,Formulaic on the Fredriksen/ Hudson numbers,"While this is a good Aerosmith album, it is their most formulaic, even on the Fredriksen/Hudson produced numbers that the band did. Jaded would have sounded good in 1989, when Pump was a hit, but it sounds so out of place here. The rest of the numbers fall to the same formulaic trap without them experimenting a bit more. Three of the songs should have been dumped, especially Just Push Play, which sounds like a faster Walk This Way that P Diddy could have done a remix on. The album's stiff sales performance in 2001 can be blamed for the music. Steven Tyler lacks passion on half the album, Joe Perry's guitar leads don't stand out, and the other band members don't bring anything new to the mix--they seem stuck in a 1988 mode. Aerosmith had made a few duds out of the greats, but this is the worst album of their post-1987 sobriety period, as forgettable as 1984's Done With Mirrors."
1,The Worst Aerosmith Album,"Save you money and see them live - go get a soda when they perform the drecht from this disc. Bad bad BAD! They've needed colaborators in the last few years, but now they've out done themselves in badness - it's like they're trying to keep one imagage while appealing to another. In the mid 70's the band didn't go disco, so why are they leaning towards techno-pop. You like Rock n' Roll? This isn't for you."
1,Not a good one!,"This book is not one that I would recommend to read. It was incredibly slow and depressing!! I was very disappointed with this book. I have read other books of hers, and thought they were great, but definately not this one!! Sorry Julia!"
4,sweet romance,This is a nice and sweet romance about one of the brigdertons children. If you like the others you will probably like this one too.
3,Its' OK.....,"The clock keeps time well as it should, so that's good. HOWEVER, twice a year, when we have to switch time for Daylight Savings, I have trouble with it. It's supposed to ""KNOW"" it and change automatically, but it doesn't. When it doesn't it's supposed to ""KNOW"" it when placed by the window - it doesn't. I try to manually change it, but then it would change itself back to 12 o'clock. I would have to try it a few times to make it ""STAY"". So It's OK. It does have the clean look; very simple, easy to see the numbers and it looks very appropriate in the office. It also keeps time very well, so I am keeping it."
2,Problem with La Crosse,This is the 2nd La Crosse clock I have had. BOTH are OFF on the time. There is NO dial to fix or reset the time so you are stuck with whatever shows. The first clock had a problem with the actual hour hand. It NEVER showed on the hour-always between the hours. This clock is OFF 3 minutes. I notified the company and they sent me a list of things to do to re-set the time. This took over 3 days to do-but to no avail-the same problem happened. The company said that if this did not fix the problem-to mail the clock back to them in the original box etc. At this point it was literally cost and time prohibitive.
2,Generally Poor Quality,"WHen this clock arrived in the mail, I unboxed it to see that the second hand had fallen off and was just laying there between the clock face and the glass. I shrugged off the defect at first, hoping that the clock would otherwise function well. It didn't.Upon inserting a battery and selecting a time zone, the clock cycled (incorrectly) to 4:00 and stayed there for the next four days. Over the coming week it took several attempts with new batteries and changed timezone settings for it to finally set itself overnight. I've yet to see how it handles a DST change, but I'm less than optimistic.Overall, the product sounds kind of cool, but when you consider how low-hassle it is to just set a clock twice a year, you're way better off just buying a normal analog clock and not having to worry about wrestling with this shoddy product to get it to work as advertised."
2,Second Hand Stops Moving,"This clock does a nice job keeping accurate time, but I have gone through two clocks and both second hands stopped moving. If I pull the batteries and restart in an hour, the second hand works for about a day. One of the reasons I wanted an analog clock was for the second hand movement. La Crosse customer support is horrible...no return calls for any of the three calls that I've placed."
5,The Next Best Thing to a Wife,"Okay, that was kind of a sexist thing to say, but I love coming home from work and having a house that smells like freshly cooked food. That's what you get from a crock pot. Mine was put away for years after I became vegan, and taken out again when I got this crockpot. Not only does this book help simplify your life and make coming home a pleasure, but the recipes are easy to follow and result in delicious food that even meat eaters would love. This would be a great house-warming or even shower present along with a nice crock pot."
1,Bland and Blah,"Every single recipe that I've tried in this book has been a huge disappointment. Everything comes out bland and mushy and downright gross. I gave it one last shot this weekend with the Mushroom and Barley soup recipe. My kitchen smelled wonderful for a few hours, but I ended up dumping the whole flavorless batch down the garbage disposal.I would not recommend this book PERIOD."
2,bean lovers cookbook,Rather disappointing. These recipes requiring cooking a lot of the ingredients before putting them in the crockpot and most of the recipes revolve around beans. I'm a vegetarian who realizes and am very glad that vegetarian doesn't mean you eat mostly beans.
3,Kids love them but overpriced,"Kids love these Bruder trucks because they are nice to look at. They just are not terribly durable and they don't have any bells and whistles. No fun doors to open, just a couple of barely moving parts. They can be fun in a sandbox if they child has an imagination but next time I will go with a less expensive, more durable toy."
3,Not very durable,"I bought this for my 2 1/2 year old son. It has small pieces that can, and have, broken off. When the toy drops onto the floor the treads usually come apart causing me to have to hook them back together, I figure eventually they will wear out and not stay back together. This is a rather small toy and seems kind of pricey. On the other hand, my son loves bulldozers and he really like this one."
5,Bruder Quality!!!!,"I cannot say enough great things about Bruder toys they are made in Germany and have such great quality and are very realistic.Our grandson loves all his Bruder trucks and diggers I first encounter the German line when our grandson was only a baby and a local toy store was having a sale, we have three girls so I was not very knowledgeable about what to get the first Grandson!I ask the owner what toys do people repeatedly buy for boys and ask for again and again and she showed me the Bruder line at first I was like ok they look sort of like old hard plastic not really tuff stuff looking, but we purchased the red and green dumb truck and what a purchase it has been.The grandson is four now and has hauled blocks, rocks sand and so on in his dump truck,the Bruder toys still look like new!He loved the caterpillar he got for Christmas he is in the process of building a road in the back yard and is asking for the Bruder Cement truck for his next Birthday."
2,Broke and my son wants another one,"When he was 3, he broke this. and now he wants another one alot. he save his money in his bank all day. for x-mas"
2,not sturdy for child,Toy is not sturdy it is very beautiful and looks authentically nice but my child broke it first time he used it
4,Lovingly Convicting!,"Seeking to understand an intimate and right relationship with a Triune God? Me too! This book that will guide you to that place but, expect to be convicted of wrong thought processes and religious traditions. I enjoyed this book and will reread as I continue my Faith journey."
4,Good but lacking scriptures,"I am really enjoying this book, but I just wish that he would make actual scripture references for the statements he makes. Deep book with nice, short chapters"
3,A great book but poorly formatted,"I enjoy reading A.W. Tozer a lot and to learn that this book was now available at kindle was very much to my delight.The book is as great as it's author and the insight given into the knowledge of the Holy is an eye-opener and heart-changer.Unfortunately the formatting is disappointing. There is not even a TOC, not to mention direct links to the starting page of each chapter. If the formatting would ever be changed and a TOC / chapter-links added, I'll change the rating to full five starts. Until then the paper version is much preferred."
5,The Knowledge of the Holy,An excellent book for anyone who wished to be more involved with God. Gives great insighs and explains a lot about the Holy.
5,Excelente!,Acabo de terminar de leer esta novela. Como he llorado! Me ha dejado un vacio enorme en el alma. Genial libro! Gracias Julia Alvarez por remontarme a esa epoca de tiranismo y conflicto politico. Gracias de una u otra manera por haber nacido en un pais privilegiado CR.
3,an ok read,"I like the book but I can't help but think that the heroine was too soft and didn't consider the feelings of the hero enough. I also agree with the last reviewer, there was lots of violence but not enough true romance."
4,Works great,"Works great hours of fun for my son with his new power wheels battery. Very durable, fast shipping, I would definitely recommend"
5,JPower Wheels 12-Volt Rechargeable Battery,My granddaughter will be a very happy little girl. I have totally rebuilt and repainted her Harley and it will be a very big surprise to her that she will be able to ride it. I am giving it to her for Christmas.Thank you very much.
4,Like new again,After five years the battery in my daughters' Barbie Jeep was showing its age and eventually failed to charge at all. This battery is an OEM direct replacement and works as well as the original battery did five years ago.
5,Battery works great,I ordered 2 of the Power Wheels 12-volt rechargeable batteries and both work great. I'm unsure of the reviews saying they don't hold a charge because I have had no problems with them. If you follow the directions for charging you will be fine.
2,Battery a dud,"After charging the battery twice, it lost it's charge. My son received a ride on for Christmas and the first battery went out within 3 months and I had to buy him a replacement. We followed all the directions on how to long charge it, etc. and still - dead. Second one in 4 months. It's too much money to keep replacing the battery so my son can ride the 4 wheeler with trailer. Poor kid."
5,Great Product,"After charging this battery once, my two year old has been having non stop fun. Buy it!"
5,Works great,My daughters use their power wheels toy all the time. This new battery holds charge wonderfully. A great replacement so they can still use the toy they love
1,"One use, then would not recharge","The battery I bought last year worked fine for one season. Although I did recharge it once every month through the winter as instructed, it was no good come Spring. (I'll try keeping it out of the cold garage next winter.) This spring I ordered another battery. This time, the battery would not recharge after one use. You cannot return the battery, but Amazon did provide a full refund. Guess I'll have to take my chances and order another. Wish I had an alternative brand for my Power Wheels battery."
1,STILL WITHOUT MERCHANDISE!!!!!!!!!,I have yet to recieve the item that I ordered from Amazon ... I have paid for the product without receipt ... Please advise as to status ... It has been at least 2 months since my order ...Robert G. Bradley
1,Extremely disappointed,"After the intial battery died within 3 months, i purchased the replacement battery on Amazon. I followed the charging instructions exactly, and the battery still died within a month. I would not recommend this battery to anyone."
4,Solid recording,"Technically this recording is excellent. The Deller Consort sings with excellent pitch, dynamics, etc. The only reserve I have about it is, probably, an issue of taste. I'm not too fond of the tone they produce. I guess I'd have to say that it's not rich enough. I much prefer the sound of the Hilliard Ensemble singing these pieces. The hymns included on this album are, for the most part, not widely recorded, so this recording offers some material you probably haven't heard before. Recommended..."
2,Died,"Died after a few years, curiously within a few weeks of when my similarly-aged La Crosse outdoor temperature sensor died. I'm now rather skeptical of La Crosse's design quality..."
2,Not as Advertised,"My clock was a cedar color, very light compared to the one in the photos. Then I poked around amazon and found out the manufacturer, La Crosse Technology, used the EXACT same photo for this clock that they used for the cherry colored clock. Their lazy use of generic photos for their product gave me a clock that doesn't match my furniture. Buyer beware. I am done with this manufacturer.Edit: Going from 1 star to 2 stars because the refund was easy and efficient."
2,Very disappointing!,"I have read all of Cheryl Holt's books and have enjoyed them very much. This book, however, I cannot recommend to anyone. It was truly awful. I actually felt the author insulting my intelligence with this wafer thin plot. I can't begin to tell you how many times I wanted to scream at the characters. JUST TELL HIM WHAT'S GOING ON, YOU MORON! Seriously. This is just an awful book. It would like to be erotic but after about the first 50 pages it is not; it would like to be romantic but the most believable romance in the book is between the older characters; it would like to be suspenseful and unpredictable but if you are genuinely surprised by the ending then you obviously don't read much.I truly felt this was an awful book, poorly executed, and obviously written only to satisfy a publisher and not a loyal reader. I have given it 2 stars because Cheryl Holt is a better author than this book would indicate."
4,The movie IS TOO better!,"Good album, but amazingly great film. Maybe the previous reviewer saw it on a small screen. This is a good album for those like me who were previously unfamiliar with rap/hiphop. Because Chuck D. is so obviously brilliant it provides an on-ramp into a sometimes disturbing form of music. The thing about pe is the ability to be absolutely serious and hilarious at the same time. No shootin' and rapin' like DMX. Chuck D. and Flavor Flav are like a buddy movie with Charleton Heston and Jerry Lewis. Even geezers like me can like this stuff! Be careful in the stores - you might accidentally buy the Aaron Copland soundtrack that has a similar cover. Buy it here and they'll send you the right one."
1,YUK!,"We shut this movie off. It was ridiculous and embarrassing for Denzel Washington. It could have essentially been a good story, but the graphic unrelated scenes distracted from any value the movie may have had."
3,"Movie had great potential, but overall three stars","This movie had great potential, but much of it didn't make sense, especially all the background music/sounds. If Shuttleworth can get his son to go to the alma matter of the warden, then his time will be reduced. Throughout the movie, his son (Ray Allen) is tempted by outside influences to attend different schools. He hates his father because he accidentally killed his mother when he was child. The movie is okay, not great, but okay. I remember this movie when it came out, so I decided to just add to my blu ray/DVD collection. Not the best acting ever, but we all know this...........the future HOF Ray Allen, the icon Denzel Washington.............they both got game."
5,The indispensable authority.,"If you have a question about a legal word or about legal writing, look it up here. You'll find the answer, and you're also likely to find a lively and intelligent discussion on the point. But the best thing about DMLU2 is that it's correct. So use it for back-up when you need to be right. Every lawyer should have it."
5,Makita 18 volt Lithitum-Ion Cordless drill,"This is the BEST cordless drill I have ever owned or used in my 27 years of remodeling experience! It's hard to believe this drill is so light, yet packed with 18V of power. At first I thought I would not like or even need the built in light, but after several weeks of use I've changed my mind. What an ingenius addition to a great tool! The 15 minute charger is great also, no long recharge times. The clutch-lock on the chuck is very nice also, it helps make bit change faster and easier. I have used this drill for more than a month and highly recommend it for heavy duty construction/remodeling work."
4,Makita BDF452HW - okay,"The Good:The battery is powerful enough and recharge is very quick.The power to size ratio is fantastic. This drills just as well as my old 14V DeWalt. Let's see if it can survive a couple 9' drops as well...It fits very well in my hand; about like my 9mm Beretta, solid and comfortable.The Bad:I was disappointed at not having any on board bit storage. There is an add-on that I found for $14.I have had difficulties similar to another reviewer in that the directional switch is a bit too low. I bump it very easily when trying to re-establish my grip. This locks it or reverses it.The LED is great, but does not shine right at the point of contact; it shines a bit lower. So in no-light situations, I have to tap the trigger to turn on the light, line up the screw, and then find the head of the screw with the bit in the half-light."
5,Makita Battery drill,I've used Makita tools professionally in my shop for over 20 years and they have proved to good performers and durable. I have an angle drill that is over fifteen years old that's still going and the batteries are still recharging (and are still available). This new drill has a lot of torque in a compact package. Unlike other battery drills that I've had this one has a 1/2 inch chuck capacity.
3,Poor Speed Control,"The first thing I did after buying this was replace a bunch of door hinges in the house. The old hinges had straight-slot screws and had been painted over many items, so even after scraping out the slot, it was tricky to keep a bit in there and remove the screw. I used the slow gear setting.With this drill, it was even more difficult, because it's turning full speed with just a slight press of the trigger. It's really difficult to get it to turn slowly, and keep turning slowly, for tasks like backing out a screw. It's pretty much 0 speed or full speed."
4,Great Screwgun - Terrible Chuck,"This screwgun is fantastic except for one major problem. The wieght, battery life, recharge time, & power are terrific. Much better than the Dewalt's that we've always used. However, the one major downfall is the chuck is constantly loosening. The screwtips/bits are always falling out & you need to always tighten the chuck before screwing/drilling almost every time. If Makita can fix this issue they would have a top-rated tool."
5,Sleek Driver,Makita BDF452HW 18 Volt Compact Lithium-Ion Driver Drill KitVery sleek powerful Driver. Much easier with the light weight from the heavier 18v models. Charges fast and hold thru the job. Well made and even bought one for my son so he won't borrow mine.
2,Great Drill Crap for Batteries,"I received this drill as a present from my parents and it worked great for approximately 16 months. Then one day while working on a project both batteries died and would not recharge. I originally thought the charger had gone bad since I couldn't believe both batteries would crap out at the exact same time. Wrong, I took the batteries to the local Home Depot who rents tools and they put them on their chargers and receive the same ""bad battery"" response. So now, I have a drill with no batteries. It will cost as much for two replacement batteries as it will to purchase the entire drill package again. If I have to spend that much I would just as soon buy a drill from a manufacturer who builds better batteries. I definitely would not recommend this drill unless you are ready to purchase new batteries every year."
2,Looks 10 years old after 1 month,"I was seduced by the ergonomics. Light weight, nice hand fit, easy chuck movement, nice ratchet tightening, Nice forward/reverse toggle placement. Super speedy battery charging. So whats to complain about? I am shocked at how much wear and tear it shows. I had a Dewalt for over 12 years and you could throw that thing off a roof and it would still work great. It weighed a ton and was incredibly unbalanced, but it was a tough tool. The makita batteries need to be carefully cleaned and maintained to get them to slide in and out of both the drill and charger. Do I have time for this? The chuck looks bad, caked with paints, resins deep scratches. I miss the butt level on the Dewalt. Nice simple visual check guide. I may just go out and find some batteries for my old Dewalt. I am not pleased with the extreme wear and tear after only a month of daily use. Argh. And despite the fact that it has more power than the Dewalt, it seems less powerful. It's a drag to drill with."
2,Where the QC?,"I bought the 3 piece combo kit and was very exicted to receive it. Unfortunately its going back as the drill was clearly defective. The chuck had a visible wobble. Firstly, the plastic piece around the chuck was not even close to being round. Secondly, the chuck itself had a visible wobble. While testing the drill it had a lot of vibration. After drilling test holes with different sized bits, it was clear that the holes were not clean. On the plus side the drill has great ergonomics and is light and very comfortable in the hand.Will I get a replacement? No. I'm going to try the Bosch Compact Tough 18v"
5,1 minor fault,"I pretty much agree with all the glowing comments and praise. (By the way, why would you specifically buy an ultra compact drill for the task of mixing thinset--a task traditionally assigned to a low RPM high torque brute of a drill). I do wish that Makita had provided 1 or 2 holders for 2"" driver bits. They are hard to do without for our operation. The existing attachment points at the base of the handle meant for securing the belt clip (how do you get one of those?) could be used for securing a bit holder that doesn't yet exist. How about it Makita? Alternatively, some clever entrepreneur could design and market this accessory. After all, it is clear that Makita is going to sell a gazillion of these near-perfect drills."
3,drill ergonomics,"The Makita BDF452HW is powerful and light. It's without a bit holder, the target point for the LCD light is shadowed by the frame and it's without bubble levels. Though the drill has great capacity, the ammenities are missing."
3,Great drill poor included battery,"I selected this drill as my prior one was worn out. The drill itself is good, my complaint is that the battery capacity is dissapointing. I wish I had got the high capacity batteries instead. They don't seem to last anywhere near as long as the batteries on my original drill. Maybe an unfair comparison as they could be different capacities, but every weekend I have to swap batteries, my old drill used to keep going for weeks with moderate usage."
5,Cool Tool,Just wanted to say that I bought this for my brother. No complaints yet. He told me that it was exactly what he wanted. Noticed that the box is kinda cheapy but the drill looks great. He likes the fact that batteries charge in only 15 minutes.
4,"what, no index?","good study bible, one of the best as you read from the rest of the reviews. but NO INDEX? the Oxford Study Bible, which includes annotaions, is the version I prefer and recommend to students."
5,As good as gold,"This Bible is popularly known as the best translation but the hardest to find in stores. I finally found it on Amazon, for a good price.It's a birthday gift. I will know exactly how good it truly is when the person who reads it raves about its immaculate interpretation of the Scriptures next to my ear."
5,Hardboiled in the Deep Freeze,"A first person private eye set in Alaska. Cecil Younger is a college dropout PI without a car or a gun and with a severe alcohol problem, There's a lot of local color, with Eskimo and Tlingit lore, but otherwise it's very much in the tradition of Raymond Chandler and Ross Macdonald. I'm a big fan of those writers so I don't know how I've managed to miss this excellent writer for so long. This was published in 1992 and this is the first time I've read any John Straley. Luckily for me it's the first of a series so I have a lot of good reading in front of me and I've started ordering the successors"
3,Good story concept but confused execution,"I liked this book, although I'll acknowledge its faults: 1. The writing is often sloppy. 2. The main character is an alcoholic, drug-addicted screwup, and does not encourage a loan of sympathy. 3. The novel is paced like a tedious movie, so that we get slammed with the main theme just before the end. 4. The author is underconfident and thus pads scenes. These aside, it is quite readable, with conversational language interspersed with witty and evocative wordplay. The voice of Cecil Young, as our narrator, is honest and clear, and gives us all the clues we need. It is an honest-to-goodness mystery with several levels, and requires cogitation. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to others."
1,Nevermind,only writhing this so as to remove my previous comment left; but I can't delete it and I can't leave it blank. so I'll just leave whatever.
4,Clean up your Diet,"This book is very helpful in showing, in a very easy to understand manner, which foods are the best to eat and which ones to eat to balance out a 'bad choice' diet. Both my husband and I lost 10 lbs. within the first month."
4,Can't complain for $29,"Got this for $29 and free shipping. First one had a bad display. Second one came from Amazon in 2 days and worked fine. Takes a while for it to sync up. Outdoor temp was screwy but then settled in to something reasonable. Don't know about the accuracy as some other people have suggested, but seems in the ballpark to be correct. Very good looking piece - for $30 it is money well spent."
4,basic functions are great,This was an easy set-up and we find it very useful and attractive. The accuracy of the product as far as temperature and humidity is great. There is no barometer per se and it tries to estimate what's happening in the weather by the barometric pressure. Living in a dessert has proven that you can't always predict weather by barometric pressure only as it hasn't rained ever when the weather station predicted. Also there are only 6 time zones so if you live outside of the United States or England the tide indicator is not going to be correct.
4,Accurate and easy setup,Before purchasing the WS-9016U I read the reviews.The best advice is to read tha manual!Follow the setup instructions.Give it time for the Atomic clock to hit. I left mine overnight and the next day it was spot on. Has accurate in temperature indoor and out as well as time for over a month of service.Don't be impatient!I had this setup in less than six minutes....AFTER reading the manual.I recommend it.
1,Would not recommend a product from this company!,"Love the concept, but.... I bought the 9016 model (LaCross Technologies is the mfr) for my wife/family for the holidays. After following the directions included with the unit and an exhaustive look through the FAQ's, etc. at the LaCross Technologies website, I still cannot get the outdoor temperature to read out on the unit - this has nothing to do with distance between the sensor and the unit, etc. -- it does not work. I suspect the transmitter is defective. The company's help desk and email help function on their web site is the worst... it does not ring through and eventually (20 min?) dumps you out of their system all-together. I received no responses from two emails. THIS COMPANY IS THE WORST -- THEIR PRODUCTS DO NOT WORK AND THEY ARE LESS THAN GENUINE ABOUT SERVICE. DO NOT BUY THEIR PRODUCTS."
1,EPIC FAIL,What is the point of paying extra for gold plated cables when the signal is transferred via LIGHT? How much light do you think is going to pass through that gold? What a ripoff. Save yourself $20 and buy a generic cable at Wal-Mart that will do just as good if not better than this rubbish.
4,Alex's Review,"This book is about a 15 year old kid named Paul Richmond that has to more to a new school full of rich punks and jocks. Paul has four friends: Meat, Charlie, St. John, and Binky. Paul meets Binky at registration for school. One night the three guys knock on Paul's window and ask him to go on a midnight drive with them to join the mail box club. When beer, mailboxes, a baseball bat, and 300 bagels are mixed in it becomes a crazy night. Over time those crazy nights become a nightly tradition. Later on Charlie and Paul get the idea to do a major revenge prank to the people at school that later on would get them in SERIOUS trouble with the cops.I gave this book 4 stars because the beginning is a little slow but after about the 3rd chapter it is good from there until the book ends."
5,A Powerful Read,"I've read several young adult novels that deal with school violence and this is really the first one that I feel truly delves into the mind of one of the perpetrators in a realistic way. Paul Richmond could be someone we know, he could be us. Flinn has the courage to remind us that violence doesn't happen in a vacuum, that all of us have a Breaking Point and that many times, our smaller cruelties may be pushing someone else to their Breaking Point. As we follow Paul through his downward spiral we are forced to look at these issues in our own homes and classrooms and wonder, who we know, who is at the edge, who is ready to break. This is a must read for kids and for teachers, too."
5,Whodunnit!!,"Great reverse psychology thriller that'll throw you for a loop. Refreshing intelligent thriller without the obligatory sex scenes, car chases and bomb blast."
5,La Crosse Clock,"Great product. Very accurate, and it is easy to see the time, without having the extra light in the room. Would definately recommend it."
5,"Easy to read display, well made remote",This unit clearly displays both the indoor and outdoor temp and humidity at the same time.The remote sensor is well made.Time is updated via atomic clock.Both are powered by AA batteries.
2,Works well when units a close,"I have been using this unit for over a year now and am disappointed by the ability of the units to communicate. Orininally I put the sending unit in the shade on the North side of the house about 30 feet and 1 wall from my kitchen, the outside temperature displayed only infrequently. So I went through the trouble of moving the sending unit closer (15 ft) from the kitchen right outside my front door (still only one outside wall). Most of the time the outside temperature does not display and does only when I move the receiving unit in the foyer near the front door about 8 feet from the sending unit. Not much of a step up from just having a 10 foot wire connecting them. All the other features on the unit work great, but without consistent outside temperature, so what?"
4,NOAA it's not.,"This unit is doing exactly what I wanted it to do; temperature and humidity indoors and out. The outside sensor registers best with a clear line of sight to the main unit and less than 80 feet between the two units. I live in Chicago, so it will get a work out. If you want more features or sophistication, spend more bucks. This is a half step up from something you can buy from the mega mart."
4,Disagreement,"The inside and outside temp sensors disagree by a little over a degree. If you're an accuracy maniac, and digital displays lead to that, you'll be a little put off."
2,Uninspired,"The subtitle for this workbook, ""Self-Assessment, Self-Care, and Self-Improvement Exercises for Mental Health Professionals,"" defies the actual content. Granted it's a workbook, but at least 50% of it is comprised of blank lines to reflect on prompt after prompt; question after question. These prompts/questions, in addition to a few surveys are the promised ""exercises"" which are not followed by anything to stimulate insightful thought by the reader."
1,Another apologist,"Clancy, a close personal friend of Ronald Reagan, pulls out all the stops in another pointless attempt to justify the incredible and unprecendented actions of Nixon and his henchmen. If you are a right-wing nut and wish to be further brainwashed, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and buy it now. If you are objective and intelligent, look elsewhere for a balanced view. Clancy should stick to writing 3rd rate novels that will soon be forgotten and leave the journalism to the professionals (who are, after all, the ones who exposed this incredibly corrupt administration in the first place)."
3,Runs a little small,"I wear an XL when it comes to T-Shirts. I never had a problem with one being too small until this shirt. It was a little tight around the pits. If it concerns you, you may want to jump up a size."
2,cheap material,"I don't see how this got USMC approved. I have tees that are over 10 years old, washed many times and still have better fabric thickness than this. I can see my hand through it! Not worth the postage to return. Semper Fi"
2,You can find this stuff online...,"I used to LOVE Cosmo as a teen (eek, it talked about sex!) but then the Internet happened and I could find all my juicy gossip and sex tips online.Back then, I would read it front to back but honestly now as a late 20s person... Not really all that interesting...I think this is great for younger teens but really... You can find all these articles online nowadays."
5,Great Magazine,This magazine is a hit with young women. I bought it for my daughter who is 21 and she absolutely loves it!
1,No magazine,"It's a little hard to review since it's been over a month now and I have yet to receive a single issue of Cosmo in my mail. It sounded like an awesome deal, but turned out to be a waste of money."
1,Cosmo subscription,"I have a Cosmo and a maxim subscription, I've gotten like three maxim subscriptions in the time it has taken me to get one Cosmo subscription"
4,"It's a pleasure read, not a news mag","I hadn't read Cosmo in YEARS, but got SUCH a good deal on Amazon that I couldn't pass it up. I saw lots of complaints from people that it was different than it used to be, but I really didn't notice it. It's still the same magazine deep down - it's not life-changing (at least for me); it's just a light, easy, sometimes-funny read.As for Amazon, the price I paid was cheaper than going out and buying a couple of issues at the newsstand. Cosmo isn't a mag I'd pay $20 a year for, but at a good price it's worth it to get your mind off your day while flipping through its pages."
1,"All Fluff, All the Time","THere is no new material in this magazine. None. If you watch the cover teasers, you will notice they repeat every few months. Old articles are rewritten with new cover teasers. There are more advertisements than articles. You might see 2-3 articles a year that actually have some substance. Cosmo fashion is [.......] at best - Marie Claire would give you better advice for that. Any health tips cosmo gives are outdated and obvious. Despite what the cover says, don't believe that you will any new sex advice either - Cosmo sensationalizes the obvious. The best thing to do before buying any magazine subscription is to purchase a single copy to see if you like it. Many libraries have magazines too, browse through the shelves for free - I've even found new magazines I've liked that way."
1,Hits The Store Several Weeks Before My Mailbox,"Although the price is a little better with a subscription, Cosmopolitan always showed up several weeks late if at all. Back in Dec 2008, I still hadn't received the Nov or Dec issue. I contacted Cosmo and they seemed to not really care. In early January, I finally received the Dec issue (everyday for about 12 days). Yes they sent me at least 10 copies of the Dec issue. It makes great kindling. I just received the June issue yesterday the 7th of July. I am a very big fan of the magazine, but I will purchase my copies at the store so I can read them at the same time as the rest of the world. Thank You Cosmopolitan for the lousy delivery service."
2,Love/Hate,"I love Cosmo magazine, but I ordered it last month and I got a postcard saying I wouldn't get one until July. I am not very happy with that."
3,magazine,I do not like the fact this is going to be automaticly renewed to my credit card without a notice!!!!
2,"useless magazine,poor service","i agree with 90% of the woman who rated this. each month the magazine is based on the same topics,boring info that every woman knows about already (and im only 20) and very poor service. its been 3 months and i havent recieved my next issue"
3,arrive in a month,"the service was great, but the magazine itself wasn't so exciting,they don't show many cool stuffs in it"
5,Cosmo,"This was a great cheap purchase. Easy to order, easy to pay for, and always delievered on time No complaints!"
1,Irresponsible Writing,"I have just cancelled my subscription after 2 years. Most issues are all the same and I suspect that they make up data for some of their articles. The last straw was when they published an article that seemed to discourage breast feeding. In my opinion, they should stick to silly articles on clothes and makeup and leave the bigger issues to writers who actually know what they are doing. I won't be giving them another penny of my money."
3,Cosmopolitan......a lil' like neopolitan.,Having a copy of Cosmopolitan Magazine available allows for short reads for short time periods. Cosmopolitan has a wide variety; something for everyone....a lil like neopolitan. Great as a time filler while you are waiting.
1,Still Haven't Received!,"I ordered a subscription to this magazine through amazon back in October...I have yet to receive my first issue. I have contacted both amazon and cosmo, and have not received any responses other than 'your subscrpiption has been extended.' This is extremely frustrating. If you want to order this magazine, I suggest you do it directly through them and NOT through amazon."
4,WOW! What a Magazine,"I used to read Cosmopolitin when I was a teenager. I thought it was delightfully delicious about male, female relationships back then. But, MY, has it really moved forward with the times. Love it!!!"
5,Fun Reading,"I subscribed to Cosmo in Aug. of 2011, and have been very happy with the product and the delivery. I gave me a ton of fun reading over the year. I recommend this subscription, especially at the low price offered by Amazon!"
1,"Same thing in every issue, poorly written, not worth the $5 subscription I paid","I subscribed to Cosmo years ago and stopped because the issues were repetitive in the same poorly written manner (with every other word italicized for emphasis - yuck). Recently succumbed to a cheap $5 subscription offer and now I'm regretting it - it's not worth it at that price, either.I'm embarrassed to admit that I get this magazine - the fashion advice is stale, articles on beauty and health are shallow, and the ubiquitous sex articles in every.single.issue and screaming from the cover are of the stuff found in cheap novels.Ugh - I'm sorry for the trees wasted on this magazine and have learned my lesson - will never subscribe again to this useless magazine! Save your money - the covers can look interesting, but when you start comparing them w/ past issues and see that they're virtually identical & look at the poor writing you will probably find that it doesn't deliver. There are better better magazines out there!!"
4,Good enough,Even it's meant for female readers. It's still good enough for me to review what women read =)
4,An alternate view,"The two previous reviews are just in certain ways: The quality of the photographs is often not high, and all the photographs are black-and-white. (Unlike what one reviewer said, however, there are often more than two photographs per chair; furthermore, in all cases there are drawings--sometimes several--highlighting the chair's structure.) The quality of the paper is not top-notch. The choice of chairs included--and excluded--is sometimes rather idiosyncratic.On the other hand, the author was himself a sculptor and furniture designer and the text provides interesting insight into the aesthetic, structural, and problem-solving features of the chairs. True, the descriptions are often brief, but they give a furniture designer's views of these chairs, and I felt I gained insights into these classics that I'd not gotten elsewhere."
1,Intellectually Dishonest,"One could say so much about this film but I will leave it at ""intellectually dishonest and manipulative""."
4,Easy and very black,"It's easy to apply due to the liquid texture and also to the pen size. the color is nice, it's deep black. I liked it very much and I would buy it again"
2,Talk about not aging well....,"I decided to peruse my collection and dust off a few more oldies, cruising down memory lane. While some have aged gracefully, others don't need to see the light of day.Unfortunately, ""All-American Girls"" falls in the latter category. It's a release that, even in 1981, was rather lame, with only a couple of songs even barely tolerable. Producer Narada Michael Walden had not quite hit his stride, as he would a few years later with Aretha's ""Freeway of Love.""It's too bad that that girls look so ""fresh"" on the cover but are saddled with ""stale"" material inside"
4,"good book, buy it","outstanding illustrations, well written, good research, would like to see this coverage done on lost war ships. another good example of bob ballard's work."
4,Light Reading about Not So Perfect Angels,"The angels - Shirley, Goodness and Mercy come to the rescue again. Quick read and simple story about good winning."
5,"A Gift to Last: Can This Be Christmas? Shirley, Goodness and Mercy","I especially loved the stories that has Shirley, Goodness and Mercy in them. And I think Debbie Macomber is one of the best story tellers."
3,I enjoy Debbie's books,I love reading Christian Christmas books during the holidays. It is fun reading about angles and how they sometimes misbehave for the good of others.
4,Another good movie,This movie is almost as good as the first movie about Mr Jolson. It is certainly a must see and definately a must listen. You don't have to be older to truly enjoy this music and the story is definately inspirational.
5,aGreat Affordable Printer,"This printer not only does beautiful photo prints but is so easy, quick, and accurate at all printing jobs. The Easy Web Print feature is absolutely fantastic! Deffinitely worth the money!"
3,Good printer just don't use on Windows 64-bit,"What I liked.Print qualitySpeedDuplexing, wastes less paper looks nicer.Separate ink tanks - $10-12 a tank, replace only the colors you ran out of.What I didn't likeNo drivers for Windows XP 64, there will be no drivers either. The line I got from Canon USA was buy a new printer. Don't bother buying if you are going to use it on a 64-bit Intel or AMD system, it flat out refuse to work."
2,BE AWARE: Disappointing unless you use Canon photo paper.,"I bought this printer based on very little research (read the reviews here and heard that Canon printers ""use less ink""). The problem is that this printer works, but if you don't use Canon brand photo paper the results are TERRIBLE. Please see my scanned printout in the customer images section above. Other than that it works fine for text printing and also does decent (not amazing) photos if you use Canon paper. It's also pretty loud and pretty big. I had a Canon i960 before and I'd say that printer prints just as well as this one, is cheaper and quieter."
1,Don't Buy From This Company,"When I purchased this item a month ago there was no indication it came without a handle. Apparrently this company engages in illegal trade practices such as false advertising.When I contacted them by phone they wanted to sell me a handle for over three times the price of the original item. Immediately after getting no satisfaction from their operator over the phone, I went to their website to make sure I wasn't mistaken, and as I watched, lo and behold they changed their ad before my eyes to includethe words ""Head Only"". One would think that this company is attempting to cover their tracks and avoid any culpability or responsibility for their negligence and false advertising on their website. [...]"
5,Gorgeous!!1,"I love this slide, you can dress it up or down. The heal on the black has a metallic sheen and the white has a glossy heel. I just had to go and order the red. For the price and the elegant style it is worth it...3 pairs for the price of one.One thing I don't like is how J. Renee stitched the name on the inside. This could be a problem if you have sensitive feet. I plan on getting a heel pad."
3,"The writer knows a bit, the editorial reviewers know less","To add to my previous short review of this book, please go to the Society for Slovene Studies page. Just type into Google, for instance: Society for Slovene Studies. And when you get there, go to Book Reviews, where you will find, a review of this book by someone. me, who, by chance, knows something about Trieste. Jan Morris's book is extremely important as it is another current book, this one by a great prose stylist, which misunderstands Italy completely. After all, Italy is the only country in Europe which has not only neo-Fascists in its government, but old Fascists,too, who fought with Mussolini's Salo republic. And the capital of that neo-Fascist Italy is...come sempre...Trieste."
1,50% failure rate,"I bought 4 of these for my wife. She loves Christmas, and decorating for the holidays. 2 worked fine, and 2 would not work at all on white light setting. they did all work on yellow light setting. Not the quality I expected."
1,Disappointed,"One candle worked ok, the other hardly at all. I purchased similar items at Walgreen's for a fraction of the price and they worked beautifully."
3,"Decent Radio, not great","I bought this radio, because I wanted an upgrade from my Radio Shack digital radio($39.99).Although the DT-300 has a lot more features than the Radio Shack portable, the reception is not quite as good.I work in an office with horrible AM reception, so I was hoping I'd be able to pick up a few more stations. Unfortunately, this wasn't the case.I was, however, impressed with the sound quality(not that this helps if you can't pick up the station).The bottom line: this radio is a good deal if you want to pay for the extra features, but if you just want good reception, stick with the cheaper models."
2,disappointed,Am is now making a clicking sound....very weak....looks great but not as strong as I had thought in terms of sensistivity.......I love poratable am-fm radios..........
5,"Little Radio, Big Performance","I've had this radio for over 6 years. I love the choice you have with this radio. Alarm, TV,AM/FM,Weather,TV. It's very easy to learn and I never lose my stations when I change batteries. I love the 90 minute automatic turn off as I fall asleep sometimes listening to AM radio. The alarm is great; not too loud, but it'll get you up! Great for traveling.I'd say the only negative is that the jack is not working properly right now and I have to manipulate the headphones to hear a broadcast. I guess I've plugged in and out too much. I'll order another in a heartbeat as this is the best, small radio a consumer could own."
4,Versatile but fragile.,"This cigarette-pack sized radio has surprisingly clear sound. It is capable of getting a variety of TV and radio stations, very helpful when you want to listen to a TV show (news, for example). The fragility comes in if the unit is dropped or banged against a rigid surface. The first one I owned was dropped onto a tile floor from a height of about 18 inches and it quit - permanently. Nothing I knew could resurrect it. But by that time I was hooked, so I saved and got another one! This one I have in a neoprene camera case for travel, and it has been dropped and still functions. Now, after not quite a year, the earbud jack is doing the fade-in fade-out, first-the-left-ear now-the-right-ear-goes-out routine. REALLY ANNOYING. But I still like this unit for its ability to get TV stations. Also, it is very light - when it hangs from my belt, it is hardly noticeable. I would buy it again but treat it with care."
3,New Passages,"Much better and more recent than the original Passages written in 1986. New Pasages is for the over 40 oldies but goodies. Not a lot of information that I had not read before, still worth the read."
3,Charming,"As a big fan of Sandra Brown, I prefer her stories with more suspense woven in. This is a sweet story, but haven't we seen it before? Where is the spell-binding mystery of many earlier novels?"
2,Prime Time,I cannot believe this is from the same author who wrote Lethal! Lethal was an amazing read. this book barely had a storyline. If you want to read about am abusive relatiomship this is the book for you.
2,Not really,"It's not really in his kiss. I disagree, it is somewhat in his kiss. What it really is is in between his thighs and his personality. Don't let Julia Quinn lie to you, she's wrong."
5,Great book!!,"""It's In His Kiss"" is the story of the youngest Bridgerton sibling. There have been six other novels. This is the next to the last of the siblings. Each book can certainly be read alone but the series is so delightful, I recommend you read all of them. The story is about Hyacinth, a quirky know-it-all heroine who was too charming to dislike and Gareth St. Clair, an irresistible loner and their search for an heirloom hidden by Gareth's paternal grandmother. Hyacinth and Gareth were very amusing, the plot was original, the story nicely paced. The intimacy between the characters sizzled, but didn't leave me feeling in need of a smoke and shower. The secondary characters have all returned from the previous novels and were fun to revisit, especially Lady Danbury, Gareth's maternal grandmother. The wonderful love and camraderie of the Bridgerton clan is always a joy. This was a great book and should be a keeper for any romance lover!!"
4,One kiss does it!,This story tells of hyacinth and her quest to find true love. This book is again one of julia's tales of love conquering all and overall is a very good read. In this story there is quite a bit of adventure which I think you will enjoy. After reading this I now beleive that there are still romantics out there!
2,At least Target takes 25% off the price!,"Ugh! Not happy with this one! However, I think a lot of readers have already reviewed it and captured my main complaints about it, so there is no point repeating what they have already pointed out. Very disappointing read, but then it's been that way with the last two books in this series....I think the author may have gotten a little overly confident with the success of this series and not devoted as much time to making the book all it could be. At this point, I hardly care what happens to Gregory, the remaining bachelor in the family! Such a shame, too, because I really enjoyed the first couple of books in the series."
3,Have not noticed a difference,I've tried taking this product for a couple weeks straight and it did not seem to help me. I really did not notice an effect with the exception of possibly a little jittery from the caffeine. It might work for you but again it just has not performed like I hoped.
3,"Good story, but editing errors!","My 3 year old loves Mr. Sneeze! It is a cute story and we enjoy reading it. However, there are several typos in the book. I could excuse just one, but after finding three I was annoyed. It seems like it would take a good editor only 5 minutes to read through and correct the story, but apparently that did not happen with this particular book."
4,Great portfolio,This is a great professional portfolio. It doesn't have that cheap three ring binder look or feel. Its firm to be protective but slighty flexible. It is the perfect size for 11'' x 14'' size pictures.
2,It is not the cheapest single pack of ramen available on Amazon!,"If you love ramen noodles like I do, but have a difficult time finding tapioca ramen, then this may be the choice for you. For me, it is still too pricey, escpecially when I can get eight bags of beef, oriental, chicken, or even spicy ramen at the local grocery store for a dollar. Also, the bag looks to be a little crunched. However, if the shipping price is low enough, you may be able to buy a bag with your Burger King Amazon gift card."
5,An excellent basic Cyclo-comp!,"The Cateye Strada is a great cyclo-computer. It has all of your basic functions, including settings for two different bikes. It was fairly simple to install, and the single push-button design is easily usable when you're barreling down the side of the road, trying not to get squashed by an 18-wheeler. On this model, you can actually see the screen when wearing polarized sunglasses, a plus that many other computers can't claim. It's been working well for me for the past 150 miles, and my friends has clocked 1500 on his, still working like the day he bought it. Great buy!"
4,"Bike Computer - Functional, but clumsy","This was a great idea - once I had it all hooked up, I realized that wireless would have been easier.No problems putting it on bike; fiancee took care of that.Do find it challenging to change the settings as the buttons are tiny and hard to use. But, easy to reset the tripdometer. Pops off easily (but not too easily) for when I park it in a public place.Seems fairly accurate and keeps me motivated to go a bit further each time.Love knowing cumulative miles done on the bike."
5,Can't miss with a Cateye,"does just what it is supposed to do. I find it very accurate. Gave the exact reading of the road we measured.Very easy to use, After initial set up."
2,Not Much of a Mystery,"This is a trivial little domestic mystery, part of a series by the same author, set in the fictional Washington State town of Alpine. Although the author depicts the climate and scenery well enough, the characters are stock and the story generates no great suspense. A nasty lady appears in town and begins self-publishing a newsletter that attacks the editor of the town's only paper, the Alpine Advocate, a gal named Emma Lord. Then the newsletter lady is found dead in her hot tub and...the story meanders on til Emma solves the murder. Annoyingly, the author makes her ""heroine"" an allegedly practicing Catholic, who goes to Mass after eating a hearty breakfast, and who has an out-of-wedlock child from her long-ago relationship with a married man. But she has the nerve to sneer at women who terminate their pregnancies as somehow being manipulated by the ""nine old men"" on the Supreme Court who legalized abortion! Sheesh!"
3,Mystifying?,"I found this book to be extremely frustrating. Unless you have time to go through the tutorials, much of the content does not make sense for quick reference."
5,Career in a Book,"The book to buy if you are looking for an all-in-one Director 6 tool. Useful for beginers, intermediate users, and a reference for the advanced. Buy this book."
1,What a RIP OFF!!!,"This book was THE worst MM instruction book ever created! If anyone could find any worth to this book then they need to buy the Brookyln Bridge. The book is simply a copy of his previous version and the same problems occur with the poorly scripted examples. Yes, your computyer (MAC or PC) will crash if you try several of them. In fact if you are using a Matrox or Diamond graphics card your boards may get damaged. Caveat tempor!"
4,classroom ice breaker,"I use this book in my classroom with juniors and seniors each semester. I teach a career awareness class and we discuss various topics focused around life in general. My students go around the room and choose a number, I then read that question....some are not appropriate, I have put an ""X"" over that question and have written another in its place. It was only a few and made for a great ice breaker to get students talking about priorities."
4,tastes great less filling,the silicone baking mat does exactly what it is supposed to do...provide a nonstick surface to bake (cookies in this case) on...i needed the non-stick surface in order to make a very very think wafer-like cookie and the silicone mat worked just fine with no added coatings required...wafers turned out very flaky-thin and separated very easily from the mat...caution: you need to adjust the cooking time because the silicone mat does not transmit heat exactly the same way your normal metal cookie sheets (aluminum or steel) would...the mat washes very easily and i would recommend the product highly!
4,Good tool,"This a must-have tool for every kitchen. It's easy to wash, and it makes cooking anything on a cookie sheet so much easier. The only complaint I'd have is that it picks up grease from whatever you cook on it and feels quite greasy after a while. Other than that, it's easy to use and quite handy."
5,Carmen,"Works great! I'm not a baker, but this makes it easy. I used it to bake a meatloaf and nothing stuck! I baked meatballs on it and they browned evenly and slid right off. I made oven fried chicken on it and it was crunch, brown, and slid right off! It fits perfectly in my Corning ware roaster. It's a winner!!!"
5,no more foil,A much better way to bake. Spend the money and get this product. It will save you frustration and money in the long run. I have used mine many times and it still looks new. Unlike some cheaper silicone mats I have had in the past this one does not stain or discolor. It does not change the temperature of the pan and everything comes off of it easily. Cleaning is pretty easy as long as you have a solid surface to wipe it down.
3,Sticks To Bottom of Pan,"I use this to even out the temperature of a Dark nonstick metal brownie pan. While it DOES help distribute the heating more evenly, it also tends to stick to the bottom of the pan. This makes it awkward when trying to check the bake on brownies because the darn thing comes off the rack with the pan, usually sticking to the back bottom and flopping about. Has a tendency to slide no matter how carefully a pan is placed upon it. I don't do bare baking straight on this product, so no opinions about that one. If you are looking, as I was, for something to improve even cooking in a standard sized modern toaster oven? It does the job, but annoyingly in the process. My oven has convection which does help when combined with this product. It has held up well and is easy to clean also."
5,My heart rejoices,"I don't know how I baked before having these. Seriously, they make for a simple prep and super fast cleanup. And when I'm baking 10 dozen cookies for a bakery order they're invaluable. Have four of them and use them several times a week."
5,Baking the easy way,"I have been using DeMarle silpats forever. They are practical, easy to use and maintain. Just wipe with a damp cloth--voila---- it is clean. They withstand temps. up to 425-450 deegrees. Roll them never fold them and they will be a blessing in your kitchen.I love them so much, I give them out for Christmas and occasion gifts.If you never tried them, do yourself a favor and do so. They replace, greasing pans, lining pans, etc. Amazon has the best price believe me."
5,Do you bake anything ever? You need one. At least.,"Silpat mats come in a variety of sizes. If you ever bake anything on a sheet, you need one of these puppies. I use them for everything from my famous oven fries to gingerbread tree ornaments and cocoa-espresso cookies.There is no flavor transfer, cleanup is easy, and they last a long time....I can't tell you the last time I scrubbed a cookie sheet or bought a roll of baking parchment."
5,Silpat Nonstick Baking Mat,Excellent product. Just lay it onto a cookie sheet and you don't need any butter or oil to keep cookies from sticking. Great calorie saver!!
5,Great baking tool,"The Silpat non-stick baking mat is wonderful. It cleans off with just a quick soapy wipe down in warm water, dries quickly, and makes it so you don't have to line or spray your baking sheets. Cookies come off it really nicely, no fighting between the stuck cookie and the spatula. The only downside is that if it rips you need to replace it as silicone fibers could get into the food. But, it lasts a really long time. We've bought multiple, the oldest being almost 5 years old. We buy them as gifts for our baking friends, too, and they love them."
3,Great except for smoking problem,"I just tried mine and it also gave me a smoking problem. Every time I took it out of the oven it triggered the smoke alarm.I alternated between using the Silpat and parchment paper. I must admit that I liked the cookies from the Silpat a little better, but the parchment never triggered the smoke alarm.I have written to the manufacturer, Demarle, to find out what they know about this. I will let you know all what they say."
5,SilPat Rules !,"I have struggled with burned hard cookies and breads, even with parchment paper, no matter what pan. Just made a huge batch of cookies and not one stuck or had a burned bottom. I don't know what rock I've been under, but I'm glad I peeked out and purchased this item !!."
4,Great...but small,"These are very nice and they work really well, but I was surprised at how small they are. I would get a size bigger if I was buying them again."
3,Silicone Baking Liner,it is really nice for baking but I expect is one size for baking pan. It was really small size for 6 cookie only.
4,Much better than a pan,I must say that this works much better than my inexpensive cookie pan purchased at the supermarket. I am very happy with purchase.
5,Best out there!,I bought this for all the women on my husbands side of the family and the loved it! they have told me they use this for everything and that it works great. highly recommended for the bakers out there!
2,cookies weren't as good,"I have been extremely disappointed in mine. They were fairly expensive, and when baking cookies, the same dough cooked on parchment paper had much better results. They didn't spread out as much and had a better texture with the parchment paper."
2,"Great on the counter, godawful in the oven","I bought one of these at a restaurant supply store so I wouldn't go through so much parchment paper. I had the same experience as many other posters - in my electric oven at 350, there was so much toxic-smelling smoke off this that it set off every smoke detector in the house We had to vacate the house until it aired out and the bread I was baking stank so badly it went straight into the trash. I will never put this in the oven again. That said, it works well as a countertop mat to knead and shape dough. It is especially useful with sticky doughs like rye bread. So I am getting some use from it, but I can't believe anyone bakes on these things."
5,stick free,We have used this for the past 3 years. Absolutely wonderfull. This was a present we got for the new daughter-in-law. Would not want to give her anything we did not also love.
2,"its OK , but just OK.","I have a Sigma on the other bike and wish that a second Sigma hadbeen my choice this time....Cat Eye is OK, but the reset is a small buttonon the rear side that has to be pushed in with a pin, and then it getsstuck under the case and you have to pry it loose...would NOT buy another.Did install easily."
4,Good Product,Received the shoes in good condition. The size 9.5 of the shoe was smaller than what I am use to purchasing.
4,Keen H2 sandles,"Sandals were everything I expected. I found good advice from former owners about moving UP a half size, which I recomend."
2,My feet got hot!,I bought these to take to Jamaica. I had read all the reviews and they sounded like a great pair of shoes.I put them on and in a few minutes of just standing my feet were hot. I couldn't believe how hot my feet got just standing in one place. I walked back and forth across the room and my feet were cool as long as I was walking.The the footbed of the shoe was hard and slightly pebbley. After I took them off the bottom of my feet were tender.I was a little disappointed in them. Since the shoes were not cheap I decided to return them.That same day I ordered a pair of Teva Omnium shoes. The Tevas arrived a few days latter and I love them.My recommendation is pass on these shoes and for about the same money buy a pair of Tevas.
3,Ehh..Dont pay full price for this Chinese crap.,The fit was a little tight. But the length of the sole fit my feet so I hope the ankle strap stretches over time. The sizing runs small so get a half size down. I'm usually a 10 but the newports i had before and these h2s are 9.5. See customer pic of my 7 year old leather newports on Amazon.Happy with the colors but the materials seem way cheaper and thinner than I had expected. Not supprised since every other Chinese product I buy keeps getting cheaper or crappier .And what happens in most company's quality control dept?!? Do they even exist anymore?
5,Keen shoes are awesome!,"Keen shoes are the most comfortable shoes I wear. With socks or without - in the water or not - I would love to wear them with everything - They don't look so good with business suits, but I wish they did!"
2,Not a happy camper,I bought these shoes for a 2 week hiking vacation in Utah. I only wore these shoes during the trip. I was happy with the comfort of the shoe however the quality was subpar. Also at the end of the day my feet really smelled bad. I felt that with sandals my feet would get enough air to breath unlike full on hiking boots. At the conclusion of the trip the stitching on the back strap of the shoes had come undone and was very loose. Not something I would expect for a shoe in this price range. I was pretty happy walking through water in these shoes. They never came off and the grip on the bottom held up pretty well.
4,Keen Men's Newport H2 Sandal,"Great product. Love the way it holds the feet (snug). Only draw back is that it makes my feet sweat on hot days, my feet never sweat in other shoes. Better as a fall shoe than summer."
1,Lumpy Soles,"I bough these as a gift, but was surprised when the recipient mentioned an uncomfortable lump in the sole of the left shoe. This is something I might expect in the $15 Wal-mart shoe, but not in this shoe which retails for $95."
4,"Comfortable, but no oder control","These sandals have been comfortable to wear for the most part, but due to the lack of odor control they become smelly and burn from extended wear. I have had to add foot powder before each use to be able to wear for more then a couple of hours. Keen should either remove the odor control as an attribute or improve its function."
3,Watch out!,"I just received these roday and I ordered them a whole size larger than my fit, they run very small because they are still too snug.I have had them on for about seven hours and besides being tight the inner sole is rough on my feet, not a very comfortable sandal. As mentioned in other reviews they are hard to get on and off.They look very nice so I'm hoping they will stretch out so I can keep them and I may have to wear socks.Amazon is a great place to shop and I buy most everything here,great customer service and no problems returning stuff."
3,"Good shoes, BUT...","Good shoes, but...I order size10, but i received size9.5.Good shoes, but...I order size10, but i received size9.5."
2,Fell apart on me,I wasn't to conviced but I was talk into getting them by my girl as she heard they were great shoes. I wore them for a week or two and loved them. Great sandle but then the stitching started to come apart. I'll sew them up myself. Almost doesn't pay to have to ship them off this time.
1,Poor Delivery,"Three days after ordering this product, so I'm not sure if the product is good or bad, but the vendor surely is something to be desired.Here it is 7 days since I've ordered this item and the shipper has yet to give any idea when this will ship. Funny there was only 1 pair left when I ordered and something tells me that 2-3 weeks into waiting I'll get an email they were out-of-stock."
5,exactly what I was expected,"comfortable, sturdy, looks nice and it was delievered exactly in time. I was very pleased with the purchase and shipment"
1,Terrible Quality,"Great concept, but poor quality. Tore apart at the seems after one use; a moderate 8 mile hike in the woods. These would be such a better product had they had better craftsmanship. Definitely not worth $100 if you plan on doing any actual hiking with them."
3,The Sweet Science of Sin,"A great introduction into the many life styles and forms of pimping which go unnoticed by todays standards of the word pimp. I would recommend this over The Pimp Game: Instructional Guide by Mickey Royal. To me Alfred Bilbo Gholson has a better grip of what pimping means, he also represents a classier type of pimp, one who doesn't believe in drugs and violence as a means of pimping."
2,Not a bible... just another pimp book,"I thought this book was going to have tons of game, but as far as my pimp book collection goes this book is just lame. If you want to read true pimp philospphy get Mickey Royal or Gentleman of leisure. This book is the classic ""I was a boss player... now I am broke, all I have are some memories and stories for my sorry #ss, but I was the real deal"". However it gives a good insight about pimp history.It is said that the game is to be sold not to be told. Well, Bilbo is selling 9 bucks of his game in this book. Maybe the square gets impressed, but for people in the game is just another pimp book"
2,Annoying snippets,"This is a follow up to ""shut Up and Play Your Guitar"" where the guitar solos were pulled out of different songs from several different concerts. Only this time, it wasn't done very well. Short solos are just yanked out of the songs and they sound exactly like that, just fragments of a song. It has a jerky feel that is annoying and unpleasant to listen to.For those interested in Zappa guitar solos, get the far superior ""Shut and Play Your Guitar"". Then go for the ""You Can't Do That On Stage"" series, maybe starting with Vol 3. There is also fine guitar work in Roxy and Elsewhere."
4,Viva la difference,"This is not just a follow-up to ""Shut Up And Play Your Guitar"", but a contrast.Don't miss it! This album is all Fender guitars, whereas""Shut Up"" was all Gibsons. Frank's intent was that ""Guitar"" be astudy in the contrast between the (then) two most popular guitarsthat he was using. Both are essential albums."
4,R. Carlos Nakai before success in the New Age Music genre,"This is early Carlos...back when he played at the coffee shop near U of A in Tucson. I absolutely love this CD as well as their other Jackalope title, Weavings. It's a strange sound to those expecting similarity to his CDs with Kater or his later solos. The first time I saw them perform these pieces live I was enthralled. If you like Nakai and synthesizer music with a Mexican/Native American sound this CD is for you. It's too bad this trio didn't record more - I much prefer this to his later CDs."
1,Stupid sales,"The Amazon organization is hard to deal with and stupid. This is a hard combination to overcome. I bought the staple gun and the staples as a package. The staples do not fit the gun. I returned both as instructed. I recieved the same gun and wrong size staples again. I tried to explain the problem but the customer service organization would just send me what were clearly form communications. I finally set the staples back, kept the gun and bought staples that fit in Home Depot."
5,Enjoyed immensely,"We had a great time listening to and studying the orchestra with Mr. Bernstein! I do not have a background in music, but with this cd and some searching on the internet, we put together an unforgetable unit for our kids, aged 2 to 9, which ended with a grand skit, with all the kids as the cast."
4,"""The People's Conductor""",Mr. Bernstein was a very personable conductor. And I remember that he was especially good with children. Children's Classics is certainly an example of this. This CD should be a part of every young music student's library.
3,"some good, but...","I don't see how everybody can say the Lansdale story was so great. I mean, it was even predictable! A PREDICTABLE LANSDALE STORY?!?!? The King offering wasn't anything that wonderful, Oates and Gaiman were just plain boring, and I was extremely disappointed in the Nancy Collins story as well.The few standouts were Ed Lee (yuck!), Partridge, and Wilson, with a few other decent offerings. I tried really hard to enjoy this, but it was more of a chore than a pleasure to read. Still, not too terrible of a way to spend your time."
5,Kitten loved it,"This past August I found a 3 week old kitten which had obviously been abandoned by her mom and was in pretty acute distress, so I rushed her right to the vet and KMR is what they gave me, along with a syringe for feeding. Kitty did not like the syringe but did very well with a tiny nursing bottle and greedily drank down an ounce or so 4 to 5 times a day. I did try the powdered form but the kitten didn't care for it so we stuck with canned. At about 6 weeks she started weaning herself off the bottle and now at 12 weeks is doing fine on regular canned cat food. KMR saved her life and I am very grateful."
1,My cats don't like it and my Vet doesn't recommend it,"My cat was sick and not eating well so I bought this on advice of a coworker after my cat had gotten a force feeding and meds from the Vet. She wouldn't touch it! I was surprised because both my cats like to lick the milk out of my cereal bowl when I am done. I asked my Vet what the major difference was between cat milk and people milk, she said they are basically the same but cats milk has taurine added to it, a nutrient that cats need more of. The vet recommended to give the cat regular milk and a taurine supplement if she would eat that. Luckily, after second force feeding she started eating again so I didn't need to go that route. My Vet said that cat milk is way over priced for what you get. This can is also very large and you have to use it very quickly."
4,How to play keyboards,I used to play piano when I was young. Now I tried to learn again and this book really helps me. The instruction is clear and really teach me step by step.
2,"Out-dated, possibly inaccurate",Amazon says this is the revised 2001 edition but I checked the copyright in mine and it is the original 1989 version. The instructions on how to use your new keyboard (throughout the book) refer to the older style keyboards. There are a few chord pictures in the back and after looking up various ones online (c major for example) the fingering the author suggest and keys are not accurate. I gave the book 2 stars because it does have songs for beginners and it is helpful when learning to read music on a staff (or stave as the author spells it)
5,Helpful learning keyboard book!,"I purchased this book as a gift for one of my grandsons who had received a new keyboard for Christmas. His mother told me, he's done quite well learning how to play using this book, so I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it. My daughter sent a little video of her son playing and I was definitely impressed."
1,Too negative,"This book is too negative. I enjoyed it at first and then it got to be too much! Would prefer a balance between put-downs, cleverness and self-deprecating humour. This book was mostly put-downs. Recommend books on Dorothy Parker with her clever witticisms to those such as this one."
1,Pop Goes the Weasel,"Okay, I love Frank Zappa. I mean, I *really* love Frank Zappa. I enjoy all of his albums, with one exception -- this one. Like one of the previous reviewers, I own it; but I never listen to it. This can't really be a serious effort. Why would anyone record music they like with the timbre of a music box throughout??!?If you want a serious introduction to the TRUE GENIUS that Frank Zappa was, try The Grand Wazoo or One Size Fits All. If you want classical Zappa, London Symphony or The Yellow Shark are both excellent. If you like Synclavier, Jazz from Hell is a masterpiece.Don't waste your time with this."
2,sims h & m fashion,we can't use it because you need to have installed sims2 first. we don't have sims2.
3,Nice Clothing.... For Female Sims...,"There is a gender bias in the sims world. Its so easy to find hot clothing for your sims 2 females.... But for the males? Not so much. I liked the idea of a major fashion store producing a pack. I can't wait for an ""old navy"" or ""hot topic"" version... But I was slightly disappointed in the men's line of clothing. Very plain. The women's clothing was hot... But I thought the men's clothes were kind of dorky and plain-looking.Overall, a decent pack... But what's the point of the runway when you can't use it for anything? Hmmm...3 stars."
3,H&M,Bought this game so my sims would have more fashion items to wear because downloading clothes always ruins my game. I was a little disappointed with how little fashion the young generations came with. There seemed to be more clothing for the adult female sims than any other. Men fashion hasn't changed much other the years but it would've been nice to get more clothing for the adult men altogether. Other than clothes the game comes with H&M stores/products. Haven't really checked out the stores personally but I guess they're good to have in your neighborhood. Overall I'd have to say if you want more clothes for your adult females then get this game. Don't expect much in the kid clothing department though. Shipping was amazing and I even got my package earlier than expected.
4,GREAT,"Such a great expansion pack, offers a variety of clothes for your female sim mostly, but i didn't like the male's clothings.. but overall, its a fun ep"
3,Great clothes,"I loved the clothes! They were beautiful and unique unlike a lot of sims clothes that fall into a lot of 'Valley Girl' or ""swimsuit"" boredom. H&M Fashion stuff gave interesting and alternative clothes for my sims. The downside being (for which I subtracted two stars) was that there was not much else."
1,"Very poor quality, cheap looking, etc.","Very surprised when this feeder arrived that one of the plastic perches was broken! Cheap plastic, very poorly designed and not a good purchase at all!"
2,"LOOKS NICE BUT VERY DIFFICULT TO USE, alas...","This feeder is practically impossible to get the top back on or to get it to hang straight. It looks nice but is a cheesy product and very frustrating to use.I came here looking for a good, easy-to-use bird-feeder! (haven't found it yet)."
5,Great,I sent this as a gift to my cousin and she told me she absolutely loved it and so do her birds.
3,Hard to keep cover on,"The bird feeder is very lovely to look at and the birds enjoy it. However, I have had trouble trying to get the lid to stay on when it is hanging -- it tilts to one side and I simply can't get it to stay on in an upright position, unless I don't hang it and just set it on a ledge, which is not what I want. I have tried using rubber bands to secure the lid. Sometimes this works; sometimes it doesn't. It takes away from the beauty of the bird feeder -- though the birds don't mind the rubber bands. I would recommend this only if one does not plan on hanging it."
5,birds of a feather,"This feeder has become the bird's favorite on our property, emptying this feeder @ almost a 2/1 rate."
4,A Good diet but flakes are too frgile.,"I feed this along with New Life Spectrum Cichlid Formula. The fish seem to love it. My cichlids are colorful and vibrant but it is hard to say which food should get the credit. I do have problems with it disintegrating even in the jar and so instead of all big flakes it comes out with a lot of tiny, borderline powdery pieces. I have found the best thing to do is not put your fingers our anything else in the jar but to very gently poor out flakes into my hand. The flakes are still very fragile but I get less of the super tiny flakes this way. The Tetra flakes I used in the past were stronger, but I think this is a better food."
4,A good sample but watch out for metadata,"Bill Withers is an under-rated, too-soon-forgotten songwriter and musician. Some of the songs are relatively unknown but that does not diminish the project. His material is as good as some of the best and well worth the small cost of this CD. The CD's metadata gets confused when ripped into Windows Media Player. Apparently this is one of those ""irregular"" compilations."
5,Who is he ?? He's damned funky!,One of the original artists of the era of true funk. This album is the perfect introduction for those new to the funk genre. Get up and turn it loose at parties with this pearl. Some great cuts and loops for DJs here as well. The full length original of Who is he (and what is he to you?) - possibly one of the funkiest tracks of all time?
2,Don't need the bracket or the pipe!!!,"Why don't they just sell the check valve by itself? That's all I needed to replace. Why the bracket?? Just use the one that's already on the vehicle!! It's much more labor intensive to replace this whole valve assembly rather than just the check vave. And they should sell the exhaust pipe separately too, for the same reason.Thank you,G-FORCE"
1,Very Unsatisfied!,"Please do not make the same mistake I made. If you are trying to buy a ""new"" book from this seller, think twice because you might get a used one instead. I paid for a ""new"" book advertised by this seller but the book I received (after 17 days) was in used condition. I contacted the seller to try to get a refund of the difference between the price of a new book vs. a used one but the seller just ignored my request. I will never purchase from this seller again!"
2,Didn't seem to do anything more than plain water,"I didn't find this to do anything more than plain water would have, but I decided it wasn't worth it to return it. So I gave it to my mom, and she seems to like it, which is why I gave it two stars."
1,Not powerful enough.,"I bought this mainly to clean eyeglasses. I wanted to use it to remove green gunk from the nosepad area of the glasses instead of me having to scrub it with a toothbrush. It removed very little of it to my disappointment.I also tried cleaning a stainless steel watchband that had not been cleaned for 5 years. The holder that comes with the unit is great, but that's about it. The water turned a little brown, but brown dirt was still in the grooves of the watchband.This cleaner is not powerful enough for real dirt. Maybe it's okay for 1 day of dirt, but what's the point of that?! I should have saved my money and bought the professional grade cleaner (which is much more $$ though, paid $300)."
3,Broke in less than a year,At first I was very satisfied with this item. It cleaned my jewelry very well. I keep it on a shoe shelf in my closet near an outlet so it's easy to access when needed. I only plug it in when I use it and that is maybe once a week for about a minute or 2.In less than a year the hinge on the lid completley crumbled. I have no idea how this could happen as there has never been any form of liquid as high up near the lid.I can still use this item but I have to remove the entire lid to use it.
2,Disappointed--Don't Waste Your Money,"I basically bought this to clean my glasses and my cds, dvds and my son's game disks. It does not do any of these things very well.To get my eyeglasses really clean it takes 4-5 minutes. I can use cleaning solution and a cleaning cloth and do a better job in 30 seconds! Where's the progress in that?? Ditto on cds etc.I was just looking for a quick, easy way to keep my glasses clean without rubbing on the lenses. This isn't it.I've been disappointed before and I'm sure this won't be the last time. Don't waste your money."
2,Not very many healthy options...,"I have to say I'm really disappointed in this book. I haven't read any of the other Abs Diet books but I picked this one up looking for a convenient meal plan and recipe ideas. In the meal plan, they recommend a smoothie a day and almost every single one of them has ice cream and/or chocolate syrup in the ingredients. If you're looking to adopt a healthy lifestyle, a 50-grams sugar, artificial meal plan is not the way to do it. I would not recommend this book."
2,Duplicate of Info in Abs Diet Book,"The first part of this book is a repeat of the info contained in the Abs Diet book. The recipes are okay. There are a lot of smoothies, egg dishes, and various recipes for various meat dishes. I'd check the book out from your local library before I spent money on it."
1,Broken Second Time It Was Used,"I have a 30lb dog and the leash broke the second time it was used. Additionally, there is no locking mechanism to keep the leash at one certain length. You have to hold the button in place to keep it at the length of your choice. I would not recommend it."
2,Didn't last,"I bought this item in Feb 2012. The bags are great and work really well in the dispenser. Recently, each time the leash would retract, I heard a funny sound. This morning while on my mile and a half walk with my dog, it extended all the way and never retracted. I spent the rest of the walk holding onto the line and praying my dog didn't see a cat, make a run for it, and chop my fingers off!! The retractable leashes I had in the past lasted until my dog chewed through the line during social visits on our walks. I'm very disappointed this leash only lasted 7 months :-<"
4,"A little bulky, but great to have","When you add the bag compartment to a leash, it makes it bulkier than normal. But it is so so nice to have bags easily accessible. Good for the price."
2,Retract Sticks,"I just bought this product today and I am already having problems. First walk out and after using the break the button sticks and it will not go back to working normally unless I manually unstick the button.On the positive note having the bag dispenser built right in the handle is a great idea, I just wish this product worked better."
5,Ernest Stevens,I really enjoyed this book. I highly recommend this book for any proud father. I was overwhelmed by the heart felt warmth on dealing with children and especially the understanding that it is never too late to make a diffence. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I have.
2,"A rather boring double CD by Zappa, I'm afraid","It's tough when your admired musical idol puts out something that you don't like, no matter how much you give it a try. The Thing-Fish concept may be great but it doesn't help much since the music just doesn't grab me. A couple of the songs are pretty cool but most of them feel like bleek versions of previously released ones. I love the You Are What You Is album but the reworked YAWYI-songs on Thing-Fish are pretty lame. Others aren't even bleek versions, rather low budget filler material that certainly do not keep up with regular Zappa standards. No wonder that many music lovers stopped listening to his music after such releases as Thing-Fish, The Man From Utopia and FZ Meets The Mothers Of Prevention. But I'm glad he came back for a last glorius tour in '88 and the YCDTOSA CD series."
1,i dunno how anyone could justify giving this nasty poo more than a star,comes off like a joke on the listener. I know good music when i hear it which is why i like zappa but this is nearly unforgivable tripe. nearly all this stuff is available in a palatable form in other albums. Im glad i didnt pay for it. this turd definitely stinks.
2,Genealogy of the Crane Family Volume I,"I was disappointed. This is a reprint that does not include ANY of the drawings, photos or other items that are not text. A poor representation of the original. You can download the orignial free, in pdf format that includes the items absent in this reprint."
2,"Numbers, statistics, and more numbers!","This book is great for people that love numbers and statistical analysis. Personally, I felt at times overwhelmed whith their abundance and almost missed the point of the whole book. The author does make some interesting and enlightening points about the fallacies of craniometry and intelligence testing. A great book to read if you want a dense, complete summary of anthropological and psychological thinking past and present."
1,Dangerous rubbish!,This book is dangerous because it pretends to be science while it is really not. It confuses the history of racism with scientific investigations into different peoples. It is just the sort of thing that gave political correctness a bad name.
1,"Maybe what you want to hear; but biased, and wrong.","These are very poor arguments. Some may find them persuasive, but logically, they are very poor. If you read even a page of this book and don't recognize this, please read a book on logic and logical fallacies. Don't do it for me, do it for yourself.By the way, if I claim there is such a thing as physical strength [an analogy], quibbling that there is upper body strength and lower body strength is not proof that strength doesn't exist, nor is it proof that the idea of measuring/quantifying a person's (overall) strength can't possibly be of any use. Likewise, pointing to one, two, or even a thousand failed attempts to measure a person's strength is also not proof that strength doesn't exist, nor is it proof that this is not a useful concept (that argument would be very tough logically).Sincerely,Mark D. Stump"
1,Don't Read This!!!!!,"The book sucks. I mean, the plot is clever but the author goes nowhere with it. His ideas are mostly either isolated or backed by quotes from slaveowners and greeks. The writing rivals the difficult swallowing of 15th century writing. Please purchase another IQ measuring book such as Freakonomics or The Bell Curve. Something with a distinct voice. Reading this book is like eating a flavorless food--unappealling."
4,it's okay ...,"Based on the reviews here, I bought it. While it shows many of the important functions in PHP, it lacked that extra which pulls the concepts together.I think it would be very helpful if the authors took an example such as a guestbook or a message board which ties several concepts together and showed how to do it."
1,Tabloid Hisotry,"Inaccurate and sensationalist. The motto of the History Channel: ""Accuracy? Who needs that?""I eagerly (not really) await the ""Ghosterhunters Do Hisotry"" series..maybe Alexander the Great will finally spill the beans!"
3,An Ok Read,"This book was set during slavery and around the beginning and end of the Civil War. I have to say that I liked but also didn't like it if that makes sense lol. I have to be honest, the story moved to slow in certain parts so it took me several days to finish it other than that it was an ok read. I wouldn't say it was a keeper but it was definitely interesting story. It's about two sisters who are biracial that get separated because one of them is sold. They eventually find each other at the end of the Civil War."
2,You're No Fun Any More,"I am a big fan of Frank Zappa which is why I took the ""Sarcasm Can Only Go So Far"" review with a grain of salt. However, after buying and listening to this CD I can honestly say that that assesment was right on the money.Though I'm a big fan of his, I found myself hoping this CD would get better after each track. The two stars are for the beautiful rendition of the jazz standard ""Stolen Moments"" and the following ""Murder By Numbers"" with Sting on guest vocals. In my opinion FZ's ""Bongo Fury"" and ""Live In New York"" are much, much better live recordings than this one."
1,"A difficult, slow read","Interesting characters, interesting history lesson. The steamy sex scenes were way too graphic for my taste and the verbage chosen to portray these scenes was obscene and unnecessary.I've read regency novels before and always understood them. It seemed that the author of this book tried to outreach the reader's intelligence by using language the average reader couldn't understand, or even imagine its meaning. Really slowed me down, almost quit reading it twice. When I got to the last page, all I could say was, ""Humph."" Funny thing was, the ending had the best descriptive scene of all.If you understand the English language of the mid-1800's, give this book a try. Otherwise, choose another one."
3,Synclavier,"Synclavier combined the ability to sample and manipulate sounds before assigning them to the various notes on a piano-type keyboard. This is Zappa as a solo artist. This is a fine example of this period of Zappa and his experiments with digital technology and the possibilities it offered. Still the compositions are fascinating, but those who favor ""The Mothers"" and Zappa's lyrics, this instrumental adventure may be diappointing."
4,Zappa the Composer,"""Jazz from Hell"" is obviously the product of Frank Zappa's discovery of the possibilities of the Synclavier, and the new freedom granted to him, it being that he could create and listen to advanced compositions that would be impossible for humans to play, thus giving him a greater range of his musical development.If people are repulsed by Jazz from Hell, or do not like it, it is most likely because that there are hardly any real insturments being played, except for the guitar solo. There's no ""eye candy""- real instruments, to be precise.However, those who can appreciate advanced compositions will most likely appreciate Jazz from Hell. This represents Zappa working without physical constrictions, creating his dreams. And that's what Jazz from Hell is, essentially. I love it."
2,"Advanced yes, amusing no","Being a completist I had to own it. Being a completist I can't bring myself to regret it, I want to keep it. But I never listen to it and it is right there with Francisco as my least favorite Zappa disc.One can admire the technical ability which must have been pretty advanced at the time. One could even admire the compositions (G spot Tornado by the Ensemble Modern illustrates the intrinsic merit of some of these works).BUT! It sounds so compressed, so robotised, so inhuman. This is not Zappa the entertainer, this is Zappa the nerd."
4,Great exposure to Pow-Wow singing for the Kids,My 128th Cherokee daughter got the biggest kick out of this album. She loves to dance around and sing....is it a bird?..NO!..is it a plane?..NO!...oh my gosh it's Mighty Mouse!... great fun!! very stirring music also!
2,Restricts flow,"I only buy 3/4"" hoses because I'm on well water. My pressure is fairly high for a well -- 50 - 65 lbs -- as I added a 100 gal tank and cranked up the switch. The Claber quick-connects are only about 5/16"" ID. That is less than half the diameter and 3/16 the cross-sectional area of a 3/4"" hose.When you put that restrictor in the line, you will seriously reduce the flow rate. If you have high pressure and a small nozzel on the end it won't matter, but if you need to push a lot of water, better stay away from these flow-restrictor connectors."
1,LEAKS!!!,Leaks through the base at the on/off switch.Letting Amazon send me another one. I will update once the new one arrives.Update 6/11/2012 - Received replacement kettle and it also leaks and from the same place. Guess I'll try a different brand.
1,Rubbish,"Very disappointing, good reviews but this did not work for me!It broken after only 5 times usage. Not worth to buy."
5,Great product,"This water kettle has the water boiling and ready for tea, instant coffee, oatmeal, etc. in an instant. I wake up in the morning and turn it on and before I can come back from the bathroom the water is already hot. Sleek style and convenient design, great product."
4,Water Kettle,"Great, works well and love the cordless feature. The water level is a little hard to read while filling."
5,Great Product-wish I found it sooner!,This is one useful gift! It s the easiest way to boil water and it has an automatic shut-off. I bought another one for my mom!
4,"Great Product, heats the water in such a short time it beats the old Tea Kettles you had to put on the stove......hands down","I would recommend this product to anyone who enjoys tea or just wants hot water. Heats the water up in no time!! So if time is a big factor, then I recommend this product to anyone who wants to heat/boil their water as quickly as possible."
2,You get what you pay for...,"This is a cheap electric kettle. It is made of steel and it boils water. But you get what you pay for.As many others pointed out, it takes *forever* to shut off. It is spewing steam like a geyser for at least a minute unless it is turned off manually. It is so bad that a kitchen cabinet above started splitting (the kettle does not look like a bargain anymore now that the cabinet needs repairing). Thankfully after less than a year it started leaking so I will gladly replace it. The plastic mesh filter disintegrated some time ago. I can only guess where pieces of it went."
5,I love this!,"I,ve had it for weeks and i absolutely love it! No more stove kettles that take forever! It boils in just minutes. And since i leave water in there, i hope it doesnt get rusty. Overall, love it! Especially since i drink a lot of tea. Now, i dont need my microwave anymore to heat up my water"
4,"Delighted, so far","I am delighted with my new kettle. It works as advertised: Fast, easy to handle, no spilling.I wish it was just a little smaller.Still not sure if it really has to be filled above the MINimum level marked outside.The main purpose for me was to boil water for one cup of coffee.Still, I like it very much."
1,Stopped working properly after one use,"Read and followed the instruction carefully. The first time worked great, after that, the auto-shut off stopped working. It just kept on boiling and boiling till no end....Very unhappy with the quality. It will cost over $10 to send it back for a replacement, and I don't feel confident that the next one would work either... doesn't seem to worth the trouble. And Amazon does not offer ""A-Z guarantee"" on item they sell, only on items other vendor sell on Amazon market place."
4,Hot Water at Work,"So I bought this thinking it would be a great way to heat water for tea at work. I tested it out at home. It takes about 6 minutes, when full, to heat the water to a boil, which is slightly longer than I expected. However, I can get 2-3 cups of tea out of one boil(mind you my cups are larger than 8 ounces). It definitely heats the water thoroughly, almost to the point of being too hot. I also get pure water with no unusual tastes from the tea kettle. Also, it doesn't dribble when I pour the water into my cup.This model is also relatively quiet. It sounds just like boiling water. It doesn't whistle or rattle or make any other noises. This is important to me, since I don't need to alert my whole office that I'm heating water.One downside is the kettle shakes a little bit when the water comes to a boil, which concerns me. So far that hasn't caused a problem."
1,Stops turning off automatically DANGEROUS,"I really liked this kettle, it did exactly what i needed it to do and did it well. My tea was always well steeped in the temperature of the water that came out and i even used the boiled water to put directly onto the stove in pots for faster boiling.However, a month and a half into owning it the automatic shutoff stopped working. When this happens and it goes unnoticed it will boil down to nothing, or in a more dangerous situation the handle and kettle become extremely hot and boiling water starts to spurt out the mouth if you were up to the top water level. This was extremely scary in a home with my toddler son running near the counters.I have emailed Aroma since my return window with amazon has closed and if it goes poorly i will likely update this review. I may try to open a discussion with amazon as well."
2,Nice looking kettle that works poorly,The kettle is very nice looking however extremly noisy when it starts boiling the water and when it reaches its boiling point it does not stop automatically. Either it takes it forever to stop boiling or it does not stop at all and we have to push the little handle manually.
3,a water kettle,I have two Aroma Awk-1155 cordless Water Kettles. could I say more? Bought it at Amazon.K. Hakanson
3,Safety question??,"I inspected this item at my local Target store and was suprised to find that the base unit was not electrically grounded (2 prong vs 3 prong plug). Since we're dealing with water and electricity, shouldn't the unit be grounded to minimize the potential shock hazard?"
4,Aroma AWK-115S X-PressWater Kettle,"I am very pleased with my recent purchase of the Aroma electric tea kettle. After researching the various models and their respective prices and comparing the pros and cons of each, I decided to go with the Aroma electric kettle. I'm very satisfied that I made an excellent choice.It looks great, size is perfect for small spaces, heats water very quickly and overall just a great kettle for the price. I gladly recommend this product over the other highly priced tea kettles."
5,Good for traveling,We took the Aroma water kettle on our recent trip so that we could boil water for making baby formula and for sterilizer bottles. The water kettle boils water quickly and doesn't take much room in the luggage.
4,heats water fast,"heats water extremely fast..i drink atleast 2-4 cups of tea at work everyday and hate to put water in the microwave, so i purchased this kettle. like previous reviews stated after one or two uses i noticed water spots at the bottom of the kettle which doesnt really pose any alarm to me. also it does come with a little filter thing at the water spout which i feel is unnecessary for me because i boil bottle water anyway but its always good to have, and once its removed its kind of difficult to put back in. good purchase tho"
2,Leaks out of the bottom seam,"When my last kettle of 5+ years began showing that it was dying, I began looking for a replacement. When I found this kettle the Aroma AWK-115S, I was really looking forward to this because I was excited about being about to put it on its base at any angle. I have an injured tendon in my dominant hand and as silly as it might sound my last kettle sometimes made my wrist hurt getting it on and off the base at the right angle.Once it arrived I did a test run with the automatic shut off and everything worked fine. So the next morning I made my tea with it and everything was fine until the day after. I noticed that it leaked out the bottom near the on off switch. At first I thought maybe I had overfilled it but I didn't even have it filled much more than half way. So basically I used this kettle five or six times and now it is dangerous to use. I am not happy with it."
5,good,good atuff quick delivery I like it the heater is awesome. It works well. A very good stuff. It is a good choice
3,Does its job!,"I was looking for a new water heater after my old plastic one gave out. This seemed to be the best option.It looks very nice and has a large capacity. The water heats EXTREMELY fast which is great! I also like that it's cordless so I can carry it to the table to pour. It's very easy to pour, won't splash.The cons: the outside gets very hot so you have to be careful to only touch the handle. It takes about 20 uses for that new kettle, funky smell/taste to go away. It leaks(!!!) out whatever water is in it after not being used for awhile. I'm use to leaving water in it and turning it on anytime I need it... this makes me want to return it.Otherwise, it does the trick! And there's no exposed heating device or plastic in contact with the water."
3,It does its job. Made in China. Spotty stains after 2 uses,"Nicely crafted. No fumey nor toxic odors. Cord is about 30 inch including the plug. Cord can be shortened by wrapping around inside under the electric base plate. Max 1.5 L is 6.34 cups, which takes about 6-6.5 minutes to boil. One minute for each cup to boil, as described. Shuts itself off after water boils. Spotty stains inside on bottom, after using 2 times. I did no hassle return."
4,"Hot water in the office, neat!",I bought this thing because the hot water contraption in the office holds approximately 4.3 ounces of water. Good luck making tea with that.A full pot boils in about 6 minutes. Good enough for me.
5,great!,We use this every day in our house and it heats water very quickly. Perfect if you drink lots of tea or want very hot water for other reasons.
1,auto shut off never worked,Boils water fast but auto shut off has not worked since I took it out of the box. I feel this is dangerous to have water boiling constantly if I accidebtally forget to wait to turn it off so am looking for a new kettle.
1,Auto-off does not work - fire & burn hazard,"Very disappointing, good reviews but this did not work for us. The Auto-off was broken and it just kept boiling. The construction was not very solid, the lid was not connected very tightly."
2,"It gets burning hot from the outside, be careful.","We got this product but once we got it going it got really hot from the outside. It was dangerously hot, I wouldn't hot recommend this product if you have children. The product does look nice and heats water fast but very HOT to touch the outside,"
2,Was great until it died...,"I loved this kettle...but it lasted (with light use)for less than a year. Spend more and get something that will last. Or heck, I had a plastic $10 electric kettle that we used for almost 10 years. This is just shiny garbage."
4,Great buy for the money,"We liked this kettle so much, we purchased a 2nd one for the office. My only slight gripe is that I can see the on/off toggle switch and/or the plastic hinge for the lid fatiguing after a while. But again, for the price, we can't complain."
3,Aroma Cordless Water Kettle,I used this last night. I didn't even fill it all the way with water. First boiled to rinse then second boiled I made a cup only for my tea. I'm not sure what other are saying that it won't shut off. It did auto shut off. So I have no complains. It's faster than my usual heating up water using my microwave. I'd recommend this product.
5,Aroma AWK-115S Hot H20 X-Press 1-1/2-Liter Cordless Water Kettle,"Great kettle. It boils water so much faster than on the stove. The kettle is far more convenient than a microwave when preparing multiple things for several people (one person wants tea, one wants oatmeal, another wants cocoa, etc.). It is stylish and the automatic shutoff is nice to have."
5,Great!,I use this in my room at college since it doesn't have open coils and I can hide it from my 11 other housemates. It works great - heats up water quickly and automatically shuts off so I can make tea in the morning even in a rush. I love it!
5,love this kettle!,"My husband was sure we wouldn't need one of these, but he's changed his tune and is thinking of getting one for his office! It boils water faster than a microwave, and looks good on the countertop. I grew up with electric kettles and missed having one around, especially in the winter. Plus during the power outages it's nice to have a cup of tea (if you have a generator) at home instead of waiting for a pot to boil on the bbq!"
3,Nice at first..,This kettle served us well for more than 3 years at home but now it started to show signs of melting on its base - so we decided to buy a new one. However I think the quality went down: we bought one such kettle to the office and it broke in like 2 months of light usage. Second one is dying also - it leaks (!) and sometimes it won`t shut off automatically. I would advise against buying this kettle unless Aroma fixes the quality issues.
5,Right product. Right price.,"I swear by an electric kettle. Knowing I can boil water for tea and never worry I've left the stove on is vital as far too often I pop the kettle on, get absorbed in what I'm doing and forget...I have two far more expensive kettles at home and at our cottage and was a little worried that this one (purchased for the office) might not be as good as they are. After using this kettle for a few weeks, it is every bit as good as the Krups and Cuisinart that we have.I'm delighted at the function, quality, and real value of this product."
1,Boiler fail to shut off after 10 months of using,The water kettle works great for about 10 months until one day it has stopped to automatically shut off by itself. It can be quite dangerous if I was not around when the first time it has happened. I could have burned the apartment down!
4,Very good value,"I have used this for 2 months and so far it works well. Fast heating, nice looking. Only thing i m not so sure about is there is some dots on the base. Not sure they are rusting dots or something else... but overall i am very happy with this kettle, it's a good value and i recommend it!"
3,Works good,I got this mainly for camping. Just plug it into the generator and have hot water in no time. It works so well I'm using it a daily basis now. It really is faster than heating water on the stove or in the microwave.
2,inconsistent quality,"I bought one about half year ago for for my home use and it has been working (so far). So I decided to buy another for my office. After about one week of usage, it won't shut off after the water is boiled. This is not a big drawback since it sits at my desktop and I can monitor it all the time. But if you cannot monitor it, don't buy this one.another cosmetic issue: there is a filter near its mouth, just after a few uses, the filter won't stay in place.I am quite disappointed with the quality."
4,Recommend,"My water-cooker for college. Works well, easy to use, highly recommend. I suggest getting one as well. I use mine in my dorm and it has not caused a problem yet."
1,Leaky kettle,"I hope this kettle works without leaking water from the bottom! It heats up water quickly and easy to use. We love it at first. But when we left the kettle overnight with water in it the water leaks out from the bottom. We tried again, wipe it dry, and put new water in. It leaks again. After the water leaks two more times, we decide to return this kettle."
4,Aroma AWK-115SHot H20 X -Press-1 1/2 Liter Cordless Water Kettle,Great Water Kettle. Comes to a boil faster than a tea kettle on stove-top. Less energy used I am hoping.
1,Kettle broke after less than 2 months,"The kettle broke after less than two months of use. Also, it takes considerable longer for the water to boil than with our previous kettle. Will not recommend it to anyone."
2,Only for mantra lovers!,"This is not like the melodic Gyuto monk chants. Rinpoche chants authentic mantras in a slightly off-key, unmelodic voice. It gets monotonous and even irritating after 10 minutes. This is for those devotees of authentic Buddhist mantras, and should not be considered ""music."""
2,not really for the katana,"this product is not really for the katana,it's a little to big ,but with a couple of velcro strips it fits a lot better"
3,"Well made, good marerials but....","This case attempts the imposssible. It is well made of good materials. Unfortunately, the Katana phone's design makes it almost impossible to use a soft case with. There is not enough for any case to hold on to on the bottom of the phone. The case will hold the phone securely to your belt, but once the phone is opened, the case does not stay securely on the phone and usually has to be adjusted before hanging the phone back on your belt. It does a nice job of protecting the phone from bumps and scratches while being carried on your belt."
4,Very Good Tutorial for the Beginner,"This is very much like having someone show you one-on-one how to knit.Tracie even tells you how to hold your knitting needles so it's all quite basic and nicely paced and geared towards the beginner.By the end of the lesson she'll have walked you through how to make a dishcloth.I'm terrible at knitting, but this DVD makes the whole process seem quite managable.She does have at least two more DVDs as well. Lesson 2 teaches you how to make mittens. Lesson three teaches you how to make scarves."
4,Flute-tastic.,"This is an album I got once after a trip to New Mexico, and obviously every time I hear it I'm transported right back to Santa Fe, on a cool night with the smell of mesquite in the air. I'm no expert, but his native american flute is so wonderful and peaceful, and sounds just as I'd expect and want it to. The music is quite relaxing and great to daydream to, and I'll assume ""Earth Spirit"" is in many a massage parlor. Highly recommended."
3,NC-17 ? I don't think so !!,"This DVD was purchased as a gift for someone who would rate it with 5 Stars. I watched it with this person, and it was well made...cast,filming,etc. BUT! I would not have watched it if the preview description had revealed how extremely explicit it was.I did not think the extended,graphicly portrayed sex scenes were necessary to convey the idea that the girl was psychologically enslaved by her captor. I expected more from Ang Lee; he managed to tell a heartbreaking story of another kind of ""forbidden"" love in Brokeback Mountain without resorting to soft porn. My 3 Stars was for the cinematography and casting only."
1,Horrible,"I cannot understand the praise for this movie. Although the plot could have been exciting and dramatic, the movie was b-o-r-i-n-g . If you are looking for an espionage thriller with sex scenes, look elsewhere. The movie loses all historical perspective, and focuses on two people for m-u-c-h t-o-o l-o-n-g.The movie was marketed to attract an audience because of the steamy sex scenes. Sorry to disappoint you, but it was like watching two unappealing people having sex, for 2 minutes in a 2 hour plus movie. Painful. I know, Tang Wei is a beautiful woman, but her beauty and acting ability are diminished in this movie due to the poor screenplay and the brief and unattractive sex scenes."
3,"Lost, Caution?","This movie had so much potential. But after watching it, I felt disappointed and used for a few bucks.The quality of the scenes and acting is superb. However, when you sit down and watch it, nothing comes together. What is the movie about? Why does it keep inconsistently flashing various scenes back and forth? It's a gorgeous film, but with no depths to write home about.I forced myself to look it up online and read plot summaries until I knew what I was watching."
4,Hmm,The story and film itself was beautiful. Be aware of some very acrobatic sex scenese that are almost difficult to watch and you'll be fine.
5,Great Price,I bought these arrows thinking they would be cheap. I was surprised at the quality. They shoot straight and are strong. I was just going to use these for target practice but I think I will be using these to hunt turkey come November. Great price great product.
4,Straight forward approach.,"This text is straight forward with many analytical models. I find I am a visual learner, so pairing this text with excellent online visuals and/or a great lecture is helpful."
2,Vander's text is better,"This book was required in a general physiology course I took because the teacher was the author. I had previously taken a human physiology course which used Vander's text. Vander's illustrations and explanations were much more helpful, especially on the difficult topic of cardiac physiology."
4,Snapshots of Another Life,Eisenberg's Twilight of the Superheroes offers a fascinating glimpse into the complex lives of ordinary people and the intricate ironies of life's turbulent journeys.
3,"Not enough Elmo, but songs were good....","I agree with the reviewer who said this was just a star turn. Why didn't these people just sign up for the new Hollywood Squares. My 19 month old loves Elmo and he didn't turn up much. Also, the host Jon Stewart is annoying! I liked the songs though."
2,I think this video is a bit distracting for children,The songs in the video are okay. There are a lot of adult scenes in it and this seems help lose my child's interest. My 19 month old daughter loves all Sesame Street video but this particular video she will walk away from while it is playing.
4,If your child likes music...,"...than he or she should love this video! It's a reasonable length, it has music and muppets, and it may be the only one of the kids' videos that I actually don't mind watching!"
2,Not the best video in our collection,"This video seems much more geared toward older children and adults than the typical Sesame Street age child. The dialouge linking the video segments together does not hold the interest of my 19 month old. The music segments are more interesting to me than they are to her. It does very little to engage my young viewer. I would suggest Barney, Blues Clues, or Bear in the Big Blue House over this video, especially for the under three crowd."
2,not another song!!,These were the words I heard every few minutes while watching this with my cousin and daughter. It is basically a collection of music videos with elmo scattered in between. The music videos were not that fun for the kids as the muppets involvement in them was very small. I don't recommend this video for elmo fans.
1,"Great for Adults, but unappetizing to children","""Elmopalooza!"" is full of the latest styles of music tastefully geared to please the whole family. Unfortunately, none of the music (except for Rosie's song) will hold the attention of a toddler. My 2 year old loves Elmo, but doesn't like this tape one bit. The music on the tape is simply not children's music. Children enjoy happy, upbeat, rhymic music that they can dance to and sing with. You won't hear that on this tape. I feel I wasted my money on this tape. You can buy this tape for your teenager, but your toddler won't like it."
3,Musical guests,"Had I known Rosie O'Donnell was a musical(?) guest on the video, I would never have purchased it."
3,it works well,"I don't like the ""magnetic"" photo albums because the sticky can ruin your photos over time. This one has great sleeves to insert photos into. My only wish is that it had a harder cover like the sleeve photo albums that I've purchased in the past. However, there are no complaints here because you can't beat the price."
2,Not sure about this one,"Well its Rhino release but it does not sound like the originals,What gives here.Listen Closely.Could there have been two versions in original release one slower than the other?"
4,Great idea; well executed,"As a fiction writer, there is never such a thing for me as learning too many things. Especially when it has to do with life around us. So, ""The Slang of Sin"" makes a great reference book for me as a writer, as well as an entertaining read. Filled to the brim with countless tidbits of information and synonyms, this book shows the results of two authors who have done their homework. Plus, it's attractively designed in easy-to-follow magazine style. Witty cartoons and illustrations by Istvan Banyai, appropriate for each chapter, are another plus.One complaint: too often the authors get carried away with their facetiousness. It's not a big problem, nor a pervasive one, but uppity, smart-alec comments such as ""get's right to the point, doesn't it!"" are distracting and annoying.Still, this is a subject rarely covered, and this book does it well."
4,Best 400-word book,"This book saved my everything when I took the TOEFL for the first time. It is well made, if you do one chapter per day in 15 days your knowledge of english words will improve for sure.Very pleased."
4,Don't be lazy! Read this to your kids!,"The Very Lazy Ladybug wants to find a new place to do her favorite thing, sleep. Unfortunately, she's spent too much time sleeping, and not enough time learning how to fly. Follow her as she tries out various animal body parts in her quest for the perfect napping spot. Great for prediction activities, developing vocabulary and adjectives, felt board stories, movement,etc.... Colorful illustrations and repetition that children will love. A great addition to any home or classroom collection!"
3,"Cute illustrations, but NOT a pop up!","I purchased this book under the impression that it was a full-on pop up book. There is only one pop-up at the end of the story, and it is hardly a ""pop-up"" by my standards. There's a flap that folds open and up, making it appear as though the ladybug is flying up, but it's not that impressive. Still a cute book, however, with fun illustrations. It's a board book, so it is sturdy. It kept my infant son happy, but NOT what I was expecting."
5,My daughter still loves this......,My daughter still loves this......Cuddlekins Wolf - 30-Inch....so soft and cuddly it's on her bed but could easily be used for a pillow! I recommend this plush super nice!~
1,Labeling is wrong,In the name of the item and at the bottom of the listing it says that it's energy star certified but in the middle when it lists the technical specs. it says that it is NOT energy star certified.So which is it? False labeling? Certified or not?
3,Crystal Clear HD Pictures But Limited Features,"I purchased this hoping that I can use my LCD as art by displaying art pictures when not in use. But that purpose was defeated when I realized that you can only display up to a maximum of 5 seconds when running in slideshow.Pros:- crystal clear HD picturesCons:- you can only select a duration of 1, 3 or 5 seconds while in slideshow mode- you must comply to DCF standards (you will have to rename your files and store in a structured folder format)- if your picture is not exactly 16:9, there will be black bars (you will have to crop your picture manually)I sure hope they will come up with a firmware update or something that can fix the duration of the slideshow. For the price, I expected more features."
4,WOW!!,this is such a weird album that it makes sense. the music is amazing and the lyrics mesmerizing. the story that zappa tells is so true and so frightening that i can hardly turn it off once ive started listening! definateley buy this one but be sure to listen while the kids arent home because it is about sex drugs and rock n roll!
5,lord of the concept albums,"YOU ONLY NEED ONE REASON TO GET THIS ALBUM: ""WATERMELON IN EAST HAY"". this 10 minute guitar instrumental is truly one of the most beautiful songs ever written/performed. Zappa takes the electric guitar to places that were never explored before. This song brought tears to my eyes the first time i heard it. This song is worth the price of this album alone. Not to mention the rest of this album is very good too. Get the album, download the song, do whatever you can to listen to ""Watermelon in East Hay""."
1,Poor movie.....waste of money,"This movies is poorly made, the producers simply didn`t capture James Pattersons vision....The tournaments and some scenarios are just not credible"
3,Basic Bike Computer,"Does its job for a reasonable price. But trip time instead of clock time would be preferable, and the adhesive pad & tie-wrap handlebar mounting is 'tool-free', but most of us have a screwdriver. For a few dollars more, the Mity-8, which I also have, has a better mount, shows trip time, and will switch trip parameters to a larger display digits for easy reading. I'll keep this one, but another time I'd go with the -8."
3,"Decent computer, awkward mounting","The computer is a very good basic computer. It seems accurate and really helped me track my rides. However, there are three cons with this product. One is that it was a bit of a pain to mount. It wasn't any major issues, but I am sure there are easier methods. The second thing as that I have had the computer fall off the mount sometimes.The last thing is a personal thing that I would have with any computer. Namely, it is dangerous because I always want to push just a little faster or try to break my speed records. But, hey, that is my own fault.Overall: It is a decent computer that requires just a bit of patience and a careful eye to make sure it didn't fall off mount and get left behind."
4,good but buy the wireless version...its' worth the price difference,We purchased this one not realizing it wasn't wireless. We called the retailer and they were very helpful with making an exchange. They didn't even charge for shipping. I would highly recommend doing business with US Bike Bargains.
3,Adventures in the Human Spirit,Book is more worn than what I had expected. I was kind of disappointed by all corners being bent or damaged.
4,Fast delivery,"Book as described and we did save some money on it, but textbooks, as a whole, are terribly overpriced!"
3,Ho-hum...,"I was actually excited about this book. I enjoyed 'Love Lessons' and once I saw this one in the bookstore, I grabbed it and started reading.The lead characters were badly written. They had no depth whatsoever. Selena Bella and her beau saved the book, but STILL they were, what, 16 and 18? I don't think that's right in those times. The villain was positively evil, and I found myself thinking how Ms. Holt could have thought of placing all the possible bad qualities in just ONE villain. I guess that's all. It's not a very good review, but I just wanted to suggest that DO NOT buy it, just borrow it from the library.*^* Marcus was stupid*^*"
3,Using for reference,I am just using this book for reference on a writing project. It is a dissertation on the subject and not a comprehensive study on the subject as a whole in the south.
3,Interesting insights but wanders,"Mearshimer makes a cogent definition of his version of realism and a strong argument for its value in explaining international relations. However, in the middle part of the book, he diverges into an excessively detailed discussion of the military aspects of power politics. One question: If the ""stopping power of water"" is so big a factor, how did tiny Western European countries manage to conquer huge tracts of the world's surface? In an effort to make his points, the author also indulges in a tremendous amount of redundancy."
5,Reckless Review,"The box, package, that contained the videos was exactly as described, in good condition. Reckless is a fun romp of a movie that mostly takes place in Manchester, England and it is nice to see the British countryside once again. Robson Green is a wonderful actor and he has a lively supporting cast. The transaction of the sale was agreeable and I appreciate all that the seller did. The product arrived on time and the seller was very fair."
1,"Gave me headaches, uncomfortable","I bought three of these no headache visors, now they are just a waste of money. I honestly tried to wear them several times for varying times up to about an hour and a half.Within minutes of putting one on I would start feeling uncomfortable because of the hard plastic square that hits right in the middle of the forehead, leaving an imprint, which eventually feels uncomfortable. I both the minimal ones becaue I had read in other reviews about the hardness of the plastic, so the smaller ones seemed less like that. I still won't wear them."
3,pretty much what was expected.,inexpensive frame that does the job. what else do you need? it's not a high end frame. the wood feels a bit like plastic and its not glass. for around 6 bucks it's not a bad buy
4,"an apostophe of greatness, followed by joe's garage.","muscially adept and mixed with a fury, this album showcases individual songs over an entire concept album. the recording techniques on this album blossom on joe's garage. Nonetheless exists excellent technical schizmatics. i did notice the tendencey on this album more than most(although Zappa does it on others) that the songs will end on a lyrical repeating non-sequiter in regards to the album as a whole.tracks 2-4 blaze, beginning with ""I'm a moron..."""
3,Another good late 70s,"Kind of commercial, even had a ""HIT"", like Frank ever cared... imagine those parents who bought this for little Johnny never realizing they were getting ""I Have Been in You"", ""Bobby Brown"" or ""Rat Tomago""... ha ha, good one Frank!Anyway, coming after the stripped down Zoot Allures (and skipping the Lather fiasco: just get that 3 CD set and skip the individual albums) this was also a fairly clean and straightforward of guitar, drums, bass and keyboards... the first cycle of four songs that used to be ""sdie 1"" is worth the price itself, but there's Belew's vocal on ""Jone's Crusher"", the beautiful ""Rubber Shirt"" (a bass and drum ""duet"" that never happened: read the liner notes), and, of course, ""Jewish Princess"".It's not a GREAT Zappa, but one you will return to every so often and scratch your head wondering why you don't listen to it more often."
2,More Jazz/Rock fusion jamming than his standard stuff,"I like Zappa's music and I like some of the songs on this two cd album. But, I had forgotten how much junk are on these albums.This one is some jazz/rock/orchestral fusion phase I guess he was going through. That woldn't be so bad, but it's so not Zappa and some clips are painful to listen to ... they're so bad. On the other hand, there's a few truly excellent instrumentals on it and a bit of his typically amusing lyrical pieces."
1,Could have been a great book,"I am only on chapter 3 and have actually enjoyed the subject up to this point but I don't believe I have ever read a techbook with so many gross mistakes. For example, page 76 states ""ANSI does use a BOM"" when in fact it should have said ""ANSI does not use a BOM"" which is easily concluded from prior text. Also, the very first code example in ADO is horribly written. One gets the impression after awhile that this is the rough first draft of the actual intended book. Wrox doesn't even list this book as one of their products on their website and I have yet to find the public errata website for this book.My criticism notwithstanding, the book could have been a great book had someone taken the time to clean it up. I get the impression someone pushed these poor guys into getting this thing ""on the street"" way before its time."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book because of its title and it's the only book out there like it.I have found this book to be very dissapointing.1. You need to download the code from Wrox to understand the examples in the book.2. The samples in the book are complex and isn't easy to follow.3. There are not enough examples.It might be good for you, but I would not recommend it."
