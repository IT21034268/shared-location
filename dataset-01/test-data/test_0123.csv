1,More of the same,"Another cookbook that is just the same old stuff! When you have lapband surgery and are eating liquids, pureed foods for 4 or more weeks you need recipes that are different and tasty. Most of these are for further along on the diet when you can eat soft food. I can get them anywhere. There are better recipes free on the internet when you google lapband recipes."
4,Wish this was out when I had WLS 4.5 years ago!!,"This is a wonderful recipe book for WLS folks; or anyone for that matter. I picked this up at the library and then decided to buy it. I've made several of the recipes and I found them easy to make and delicious... even my family loved them.I had WLS almost 5 years ago and I wish that books such as this had been available. This book is a great assess as I continue to search for new healthy ways to prepare meals. The recipes are high protein, low in fat, low cal, and no sugar. All I can say is YUMMY!!! I highly recommend this book."
1,NOTORIOUS P.I.G. is BORING,"I bought this cd and every song was sorry, I can't beleive i've wasted money on this. If you are thinking about buying this cd DO NOT... If u want some real music buy one of 2pac's CD's all of them are good. As for Notorious P.I.G. you are no good homez..."
1,not,just didnt do it for me. i thought it was something different. thought it was the whole documentary. but it wasnt
1,These stinkers are laughable,"I must admit that I couldn't bring myself to watch the last one. These STINK. The end of the first movie encapsulates the whole mess: Lightning and thunder every second, man gets trapped in haunted house, falls in a big black pool of oil, but it lets him go, the front door just turns out to be a little sticky and out he goes to his waiting family (amid all the thunder and lightning). You can almost see the lighting guy switching the lightning lights on and off as fast as he can. Oooooh scaaaary."
2,Musical,"Had no idea the story was mainly a musical. Considering the timeframe of when it was distributed, I guess it makes sense. The story was drab and didn't keep anyone's attention very well."
3,An irritating film to watch,"I realize that this is rather shallow, but I honestly had trouble enjoying this movie as a result of how poorly done the subtitles were. Not only is the default language setting of the DVD set to Hindi, but then even when you do get the subtitles turned on, they turn out to be barely readable and flash on the screen for a second at best. What good is beautiful imagery if you can't understand whats going on?"
3,"More warm, not so much sizzle","Ok, this book was funny, entertainable, and predictable. There was no tragic break-up with a happy reunion. The end of friendship thing lasted, like, two pages. It was pretty funny, but it's not the type of book that keeps you guessing until the end. It's basically about a girl named Lula finding out about herself. But, she doesn't change from self concious to a wild woman. I think that they could have edited it a little more and added more of a plot twist. I don't know. It was fun to read but not really enlighting. I've read sooooooo many better spring break books. Yet, I must admit, this wasn't the worst. It could have been a lot better. If you want to check it out of a lib. then go ahead. But PLEASE don't waste your money."
2,"Ear -today, but not tomorrow","My major musicial disappointment of the year 2000. After the success of Phoenix Rising, it was always gonna be hard to follow. I didn't think that they would fall so far from grace. As I've previously stated, I'm a Tempts fan from waaaaaay back, however I have to admit, I won't be playing this very often. Most of these songs are forgettable. Support the Tempts, but save your cash. Hurts me to say that. Maybe next time."
2,Ear-Forgettable,"Phoenix Rising was a far better Disc then this mess.Only The Fact the Temptations have Good Vocals Keep them from SOunding Like Everybody else.The Production,Written&Music are So Predictable.this Music would Be Good For LSG but not for a Group Like The Temps?I'll stick too the Classics&Forget this One."
4,Good CD,They keep belting out the hits. They have some really good tracks on this CD. It's worth the investment.
2,Is the Phoenix Still Rising?,"There will never be another Phoenix Rising!!! Phoenix Rising is a CD that is worth listening to over and over again. Those who are into ""Steppin"" or ""Swingin' Out"" know that this album is our anthem. Ear-Resistible just left me hanging on waiting for the tunes to get better but they never did. Whatever chemistry was used to make the Phoenix Rise, the Temps need to go back and get it. In my opinion, it is only on the talent of the performers that this album is able to bring a touch of pleasure. I sure hope the Phoenix will rise again!!!!!"
4,Heal Your Knees,"Book provided understandable explanation of knee injuries, but the most important information for me, were the pictures and descriptions of the exercises that help strengthen your knees prior to considering surgery."
5,"Great product, great service","I love these bars for breakfast so I order several boxes at a time to always have them on hand. Sometimes there are quality issues, especially when it's warm outside & the chocolate melts & rehardens, but this group has been fresh & delicious. They arrived very quickly too."
2,not very brownie or crunchy...,"i was recently diagnosed w/ gestational diabetes... thus began my quest for a yummy protein bar... this isn't it. i'm giving it 2 stars because my blood sugar levels were within the desired range after having it as a snack. i'm going to try the other flavors, but this one definitely is not one i'd like to have again."
3,Novellete of an Infantry Platoon in Italy,"This small book covers a single day in the life of a platoon of war-weary American GIs as they hit a remote beach in Italy and try to accomplish their mission of taking a key farmhouse 6 miles inland from the beach. The difficulty arises when the platoon leader lieutenant and 3 top NCOs are immediately killed or knocked out of action. The leadership of the platoon falls on a lower ranking NCO who is not very sure of himself and never dreamed he would find himself in this position. He does an admirable job dodging strafing planes, a German armored car and fleeing Italian soldiers before attacking the farmhouse and trying to blow a crucial bridge."
1,Disappointed...,I am disappointed that I've tried to contact the seller via email as well as written correspondence and both have gone ignored. We did not received what we ordered and the missing items were replaced with unwanted items.
3,Sad lack of color photos on this book.,"I was hoping to get color photos of proud German soldiers in their uniforms but they're all black and white which, needless to say is uninspiring to read.Otherwise, it's well-written and the black and white photos do an ok job of depicting the uniforms."
2,fair,a little too deep for a 92 year old. I suppose the series as a whole is good reading for someone who can focus a little better than me.
2,Xbox X Wireless Multi Player Kit Controller,"Controllers appear to be a bit buggy. Hight latency and EMI appears to affect them easily. If I could do it all over again, I would have gotten different controllers. You get what you pay for with this one."
2,Reservation Road to Boredom,This movie has three plot points that could be covered in fifteen minutes. The rest is filler. There is no real character development; no twists in the story. Nobody changes. The characters get stressed - that's all. Take out one swear word and this is a Lifetime movie. A waste of fine acting talent. A waste of time watching it.
1,Reservation road,"Do not purchase this video for online viewing. It had NO sound, it was very low. I checked my computer and my volume was working fine, it was the online video that I purchased that did not have the volume. What a waste of money, I did not get it refunded either. DO not order this one."
5,Loved the novel.....,"The novel Reservation Road explored the relationship between fathers and sons and the emotional hangover that can linger after tragedy. The book did did this effectively, avoiding cheap cliche and sentimentality, and watching this trailer, it looks like they matched the stark and brutal, yet somehow beautiful tones contained in the novel. I'm looking forward to this film."
4,Nice purchase!,"I purchased this jacket as a gift for my 78 year old mother. She loved it! The removable collar is really nice and a fun idea. The jacket was a bit shorter than I anticipated, but still cute. If you are wondering about the size, go a size up. I think these may run a bit small in size. Quality was very nice. It is lightly quilted inside, so perfect for cooler days. I thought it was good quality for a very good price."
3,Failed my specifc expectations,"Let me start by saying that I do not pretend to be able to critique this kind of music. I bought the CD for one specific piece, that being ""The Flight of the Bumblebee"", which happens to be a favorite of mine. The entire album was well performed and I do not have any complaints there. It failed my expectations in two ways though. The first was that I was hoping the piano would be the main instrument in the flight of the bumblebee. It wasn't but that cannot be blamed on them. The second disappointment though was the length. Since I bought it for one piece of music I was extremely disappointed that it was so short. The CD lists it at 1 minute 33 seconds. In actuality it only lasted 1 minute 17 seconds. Since that was listed in the album title you would have expected it to be a larger portion of the music than what it was."
3,The book was different but interesting.,"I liked the book because it was interesting. Many different things happened throughout the book that I thought were neat. Many parts of the book weren't very good, but somethings I could realate to or really understand. I didn't think some parts in the book were very realistic considering the fact that, who would eat another human being? The boys were suffering and couldn't find anything to survive on their own. It was not always realistic considering I didn't think that some conditions they got into were that serious."
4,I thought this book was interesting and sometimes boring.,"This book was very interesting and it had a lot of history in it too. I really understood how it was back then. Sometimes this book could get boring, but other than that I wanted to read the whole book in one night."
3,I recommend this book to forteen to twenty-one year olds,I recommend this book to anyone between fourteen and twenty-one. There are some pretty bad parts that would give little kids bad ideas. Also there is some language that would be inappropriate for anyone under fourteen. There were some very good details and they actually used very important people in history.
3,I liked the novel but it is sad because of the homelesss peo,I liked the book because people can laern a lesson about herbs and how they can mess up your body and mess up your life.I know more about homelessness people and they never know how long they will be living like they do.It is a sad thing to think about but some of them could never change because they lived like that for to long. It would be to hard on them and some people might think that they could never go back to thier old selfs.Some of the homelesssness people might have lived that way thier hole life.
2,"I hate to say this, but........","First of all I would like to clear up that I am a huge Danzig fan and I love all the cd's he has put out, untill now. The song selection is incredible and with all the hype that was going on for this cd coming out I was really excited when I bought it, only to be dissapointed. There has got to be better versions of the songs that were put out, as on most of the songs you can bairly make out what Glen is singing. And when he is singing it is not the normal deep smooth voice that we are accustomed to, but it sounds very raspy as his yelling goes from high to low frequency. Basically it sounds like he is constantly moving the microphone towards and away from his face, denying us the full potential that this album should have given us. Again I'm sorry to have put out a bad review on an Album from Danzig, but that's how I feel."
2,Mediocre at Best,I love Danzig but have to admit that this cd is a waste of money. First of all I thought the cover art looks...cheesy. Does not have the same classic dark look as I'm used to with Danzig. The first cd I think sounds pretty good. Not great but its very listenable and I enjoy it. The second cd recorded during the Satans Child tour is [not very good] though. ...I'm only halfway through it and I'm about to turn it off. I cannot recommend this cd set because its only mediocre at best...
1,"Honestly, Save Your Money","I'm a big Danzig fan but I cannot believe how bad this album is. Not only is the recording quality awful but Glenn couldn't even bother to keep from pulling the mike away from his mouth before he was done singing. You end up with words cut off and what you do hear is bad, anyway. I should have listened to the reviews but I thought, ""How bad can it be?"" Really, really, bad. On the other hand, I don't look down on overdubbing live albums so much anymore."
2,Pretty bad sound quality..Even for a Live Album.,"1 disc is for the ""Oldies"" and the other one is for the newer songs. the quality leaves little to be desired. what Happened? some of the songs could have come out awesome, but Ive heard bootlegs with better quality than this."
5,Double Live CD ROCKS!!!,This is a great cd! Both cd are awesome! Over 2 hours worth of music. Killer pics also. I definately recommend this.
5,"One Small Step For Man, One Giant Leap For Mankind","This is a larger scale (1/48) dual model of the Apollo 11 Command-Service Module (CSM) ""Columbia"" and the Lunar Excursion Module (LEM) ""Eagle"" that first took men to the Moon in 1969. For those of you who don't remember or are too young to know, Apollo 11 lifted off on July 16, 1969, man first walked on the Moon on July 20, and the crew splashed down on July 24, 1969.The three segments can come apart for examination, though they are fragile and so are best used as a static display piece on your bookshelf. This model is a bit pricey, but is a good buy for the historian or the enthusiast or the teacher."
5,Great book,This book is excellent and I have given it as a gift to two other people. They have told me that the book has helped them a lot with their relationships. The book is remarkable well done. The book is well organized and easy to understand. The pieces of advice can be used for daily life. I recommend this book to anybody who reall would like to preserve a good relationship.
5,What you should know about marriage before you get married.,"Great workbook for coming to terms with the differences that create strife in marriage. Help for couples to work out their real boundries and expectations with each other, their children and their families. I highly recommend this book for engaged couples to work on their relationship more than work on the wedding day plans. A great book to read together and get communication with each other moving in a positive, functional way."
4,Conspiracy?,"This lecture by Ian R. Crane presents a wealth of information to contemplate. If you think the relationship between money, government and the pharmaceutical industry is a little scary, this may find you screaming. And if you're a conspiracy buff, you might not be surprised to learn that Donald Rumsfield was involved in promoting both the Swine Flu scare of 1976 and the more recent Bird Flu scare. Did he have a political and financial interest in creating panic? Maybe, but one thing is true: the Politics of Fear is alive and well, and the aim is power, money and control. Whether there's an overall plan is a leap of faith, however. Crane makes that leap, but I'm not so sure."
3,Inane & Adorable,"This is an inane biography that is of the teen-zine 16! Magazine and Tiger Beat ilk. The Beatles are presented as wholesome boys next door instead of the worldly young men they actually were. Each Beatle is given his own chapter replete with his astrological sign and attributes. This would have gotten a 2-star rating if not for the adorable pictures of the boys, which make this worthwhile along with its copyright date, 1964."
1,VERY dissapointing!,"after i bought this cd, i got sick of it after 3 listens. Almost all the songs seem like fillers and none of the are catchy. the only halfway good song would be ""words to me"" but still, this cd was a waste of [money]"
5,The New Adventures of Mother Goose,My kids enjoyed this book so much they have most of the poems memorized. This is a much more enjoyable version to read than the original Mother Goose. I received the book as a shower gift and have since bought three copies as gifts for other children.
1,Unreadable on Kindle,"Just downloaded this on laptop and android phone and it is almost useless on both, because all of the phrases, verb charts, etc are image files that are too small to read. The regular text explaining the language, and the dictionary are fine, but as there is no way to enlarge the text in the tables (must be image files), you literally need a magnifying glass to see them. Worse, some are sideways oriented 180 in wrong direction and cannot be rotated. Someone should have checked this before marketing as an e-book. It is probably fine in print. Just requested a refund- first e-book I have bought that is not readable on my android phone, or even laptop."
5,Janiya's Review (3rd Grader),"Do you like Bailey School Kids books? Well you should, because they're funny and interesting. There are four main characters named Melody, Liza, Howie and Eddie. They always go on trips and the books always have a shocking problem and solution. In this book, the funny part was when the kids thought Bigfoot ate the dentist and also they think Bigfoot can't square dace on Ruby Mountain. My favorite part is when Liza got scared because she saw a monster with two huge feet. I would be scared a little, but I would get used of it. You will like this book if you're not scared of monsters like Liza is and also if you like going on adventures. This is a good book if you think you're tough and strong because you might not be so brave when you see a big monster with huge weird feet."
4,Chance is no gamble,"No need to gamble when you pick up a Spenser novel. You know the tough wisecracking hero and his supercool sidekick Hawk will beat the odds and come out fine. Spenser stirs up the entire Boston mob scene, and takes some of them along on a junket to Vegas in this highly entertaining yarn. Fights and dead bodies pop up almost as frequently as Hawk's sage advice to Spenser. One thing you can bet on - Spenser's justice will prevail. Anybody who has ever enjoyed a Spenser novel will certainly not be dissappointed."
4,Chance by Robert B. Parker,"I love all of Robert Parker books. I just got through reading Chance.They are always interesting, exciting, and enjoyable to read."
4,Halleluja to more diverse characters!,"Thank goodness Harlequin Blaze has finally opened up to more diverse characters. I too thought this interracial, until I read Mia's review below. I've been reading this line, Harlequin Temptation before it, and other romances for years. I've always hated the segregation of these characters. And yes, I've read the books where the hero or heroine is 1/8th something -- just enough to call it 'exotic.' Category romance has been the last world to be integrated. It's a good thing."
5,Melissa & Doug Magnetic Wooden Alphabet,"Two year old grand daughter loves these letters and wants to spell everything. Very educational. Our refrigerator is full, we have two sets."
2,Mess,"These were given to my children (ages 4 and 2)as a gift. I loved that they were alphabet and number toys, and I have had good experiences with Melissa and Doug brand products in the past. But these turned into a huge mess when my two year olds and to a lesser extent, my 4 year olds, started puting them in their mouths. the paint came right off. There bits of pain on them in their mouths, on their hands, every where. They were such a mess, that I ended up throwing them out. Too bad :("
1,Junk,"These are the worst items I have ever purchased for my grand daughters. they are wood with colored paper covering the wood. Which comes off almost immediately. What a pile of garbage. Not worth returning. Don't bother purchasing this crap-I'm done with Melissa and Doug children's toys, I haven't been happy with any of their stuff except maybe the pull along Dog. I don't know how they get away with their shoddy products."
4,Little guy loves them!,"We bought these letters for our 16 month old son and from day one he has really enjoyed playing with them and putting them all over our refrigerator and his art easel. They are durable and stand up to the rough treatment of an active toddler and a curious dog who thought the letter ""a"" was a doggie treat. :)"
2,Disappointed.,"I bought these because I am usually very happy with M&D toys and was trying to avoid buying plastic. These letters were much thinner than I was expecting, and the magnets are pretty weak. They are difficult for my 2-year old to grab. The worst part about them is the colored paper front - I really thought they would be solid wood, painted over. Any drool or other liquid will quickly ruin these, as I quickly found out about ten minutes into play time. I am SO disappointed!"
2,I was expecting better from M&D!,"I was expecting better quality from Melissa and Doug since I have some of their other products.These DO NOT fall into the better made quality I am used to. The letters which I thought would be all wood are not.They have a paper coating which will come off with use. But the part I hate the most is the acrylic sliding cover that comes off wayyyyyyy to easy. All the child has to do is tilt the box just a little and the lid slides right off as well as all the letter we just put back in the box! This could have been prevented by just putting a little lip on the lid so it locked into place just a little but still allowing the child to remove and replace the lid. Since these are not going to last long and the price was ok, I will replace with better quality ones later.DISAPPOINTED!"
1,Hmmm,"I must be a complete idiot...or else the description of this set is very misleading,. I checked the ""dimensions"" for this toy as my grandson is only 2, and assumed the ""2x5.5x8 inches"" meant the size of each piece...2 inches thick, 5.5 inches wide, and 8 inches high...obviously not a swallowing threat. Welll, the dimensions are the box dimensions (who cares.??.)...needless to say when I got the set, right on the box said it ""not for children under 3""...It might be a good idea for the maker or Amazon to put a piece in the ad so we can see the actual size of the piece. I'll be sending this back....and missing my grandson's birthday date."
2,Not what I expected,"It would have been nice to have been informed that these pieces are only a few inches long. I assumed by looking at the photos that these were about twice the size, so I was disappointed. My children only played with them once for a little bit and haven't touched them ever since.Arlen"
4,Very well made,"the back is completely covered with magnet, unlike some of these other plastic versions, where it may have a small part of it covered with a small magnet. Excellent for the price, good quality."
1,THESE CONTAIN LEAD in the Magnets!,"I thought these were SO COOL, then I had them tested at a local free lead testing for kids toys and they came back POSITIVE. Further research at Healthytoys dot org showed that the magnets contain a MEDIUM level of LEAD!!!. If you child is extra careful not to touch the magnet parts then I guess these are fine, but if your child is like mine and likes to touch the entire thing and then put his fingers in his mouth, these are too dangerous.Healthytoys dot org lists lots of toys as both safe and unsafe, according to brand. It's good to be careful these days."
1,Splintered Wood,I was really disappointed with this product. The letters are wooden but when I opened it each letter was splintered and pieces of wood shards were sticking up from the joints of each letter. I can't give this to my son at all. Glad I only ordered this one item from Melissa and Doug because I don't think I ever will again.I'm amazed it was shipped out like this especially considering the age group it is geared towards...
5,Best jewelry book for beginners!,"I have looked at a lot of jewelry making books and reviewed a few on Amazon. Not all of the jewelry designs in this book appeal to me, but I have to say that this is the very best book I've seen for beginners. Other books say they are for beginners, but are still difficult to follow without having some prior experience. The processes used for constructing these mostly attractive necklaces, earrings and bracelets are clearly evident in large, close-up photos and provide the beginner with all the basic techniques. Once you've learned the techniques from this book, you should be able to graduate to other, more difficult jewelry-making books. Just take this book with you to the local bead store, point out the materials you need, and they'll help you find them and you'll be ready to create!"
2,Probably not what you're hoping for.,"Don't let the 996 on the cover fool you; this video was produced in 1994. Good historical footage of 356 and air-cooled 911s through the 993. Brief mention of 930s and 959, although the latter only in terms of its rally success. Overall, a superficial examination of the 356 and 911 (about equal run time allotted to each)."
2,This cam is too old.,"I'm not saying that you can't get the job done w/ that cam. But considering the cheaoer DVX100 does the job better, the XL1s isn't appealing anymore. Interchangeable lens? Each one [is expensive], so only a few ""pros"" can afford that. But then again, I'd rather buy the JVC GY-DV5000 (I'm not talking about the ""GR""-DV5000 or 4000), which offers far more than the XL1s. Also image quality ""overall"" is not as good as DVX100 and PD150."
1,A Waste of Money,I purchased this bean bag and it only lasted three months. The vinyl is paper thin and the seams ripped in a number of places. I have had vinyl bean bags rip before and have taken them to a an upholsterer but this material and craftsmanship is so poor it cannot be salvaged. It is cute to look at but will not hold up to small children.
4,Very good,"Im sure you know what this case can do, so Ill skip that and tell you a few other things. First off I could easily fit my two extra memory sticks in the case along with the cloth with no problem. Second of all, this case does a very nice job by always charging your psp and using the cases battery before using the psps. It also comes with a 5 foot cable so you do not have to play it in the case. It takes about 7 or 8 hours to charge and adds about 6 exra hours to the psp. The only problem is that the little rubber flap thing is kinda hard to open. Some ppl say it is also watertight,but no one wants to test the theory, so I guess we will never know..."
2,Well written but disappointed,"I thought this was a great effort by McCann but I must admit that I was disappointed in the development of the main characters. It took too long to get to the point and when I finally made it to the grand finale, I was extremely heartbroken that there were only a few pages left in the book.I will not be so narrow-minded to say that I'd never read another one of his books because I love to read and I think he did a great job for a first try. I'd love to read the sequel to Until."
5,Da Bomb,"I met the author at Essence. He was doing a signing with another one of my favortie authors and I thought I was buy his book becasue he looked ""So Good"". Well to make a long story short I LOVED the story. I read this book in one night and all I can say is if you have yet to read it. .. the ending is off the hook.It makes me belive in love. . yet it is not a romance novel and thats a hard line to walk for me.Keep it real my brother!"
5,This book is one good read!,"I picked this book up one morning, and went on an unpredictable journey! I got caught up in the story right away, and it never let me go. At certain points in the book, and several times, I just had to put it down and savor the moment. It's a story that I've lived, had pain over, and dreamed about as well. Just as you're sure you know what's going to happen, something else happens instead. Timmothy McCann has such a sentimental touch, a feel of genuine emotion. I just cant say enough about this book in this forum. If it is possible to be in love with a book, I was ""in love"" with this one. Kudo's to this author! Good luck in all of your future endeavors. I can't wait to read your next ""masterpiece"""
4,The Europeans stomp the techno scene again,"The tracks on this cd allow you to have the hard, bumpin, cuts and the softer, stompin, tunes which create a mix that is unbeatable. This cd is not mixed together by any dj. The tracks are not mixed together, which if you have a favorite song allows you to listen to it completeley without anything mixed in. The breaks in these techno songs are most impressive of all. The beats come in at the perfect times, creating the expectation that any good club music should. I was overall very impressed!"
4,It is basically what I look for in a simple bedside clock,"Pros:(1) It synced rapidly to the atomic clock in Colorado (I'm near Portland OR)(2) It has daylight savings time built into it, so no need to diddle with the clock at those two times each year(3) Shows the day of week and date at the bottom of the display(4) Button bar on top edge activates the backlighting for 4 seconds(5) Has a low battery indicator (uses two AA cells)Cons:(1) When backlight is activated, a very faint but audible whining tone is produced, which at night, might be annoying to your spouse(2) Time display numbers could be a bit larger - they are 1.25 inches high"
5,It's PG Wodehouse- what's not to like?,"I really enjoy Mr Wodehouse's sense of humor, and of course his stereotypical English butler- Jeeves. This story however does not feature Jeeves, but instead a Lord Dawlish- better known as Bill, -a peer with a title, but very little else. He's a nice guy, but lacks worldly experience and sophistication. He does however have a fiance', Claire who very much wants him to acquire vast amounts of money in order to keep her in the style with which she would like to become accustomed. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys period pieces."
5,fun book,"all the sweet potato queens books are fun reads. this one is no different, only with some fattening recipes."
2,reprint,This book is a direct reprint from 1980. It was good then but much of it is out of date. Some of the sections in this one and the design one are the same. Having been in the trade for 27 years I found it useless.
3,Lukewarm Christmas Movie,"Reese and Vaughn were a horrible matchup. There wasn't any chemistry between the two of them. There were a couple of laughs, but I was mostly bored. I really like both of the actors, but just not in this movie. Oh well maybe a better Christmas movie will come out next year."
4,Four Christmases,"I wanted this DVD for 2 reasons: 1) I really like the actors & 2) I'm a Christmas junkie & wanted to add another Christmas movie to my stash! I was expecting some of the situations, but not all - didn't realize they wouldn't ""like"" Christmas, but was glad it wasn't (another) updated Scrooge story. Thought the parents were pretty good ""characters"" but his mom with his best friend was a bit ""icky"" for me...Vince's brothers were a bit over the top, too.All-in-all, a movie I would watch a couple of times a Christmas Season. I would give it a 7.5 on a scale of 1-10."
3,Cute Movie,Cute movie with a few funny parts. Not as good as I thought it would be. Worth watching. Not terrible.
3,If you are looking for a Christmas movie,"Look elsewere since Christmas just serves as a backdrop. If you want a romatic comedy that has touches of Christmas, then check it out."
3,Four Christmases,Four Christmases had potential and I love the actors/actresses in the movie although some humor was way too crude in some of the scenes for our family.
5,I loved it.,Didn't think I would but this is a very funny film. It made me laugh out loud. Far fetched but suspend reality and you will enjoy it.
1,Bad Movie,Do not see this horrible movie. this movie sux cuz baby pukes all over RW. thats why its bad. i hate vomitting jokes. buts it is fine when it get on an unanimated object but not on a person. especialy a blonde thats hot. or anyone its not funnie
1,You had better watch out...this movie will make you cry (it's that bad)!,"I believe this is my first one-star review. I was really looking forward to a new Christmas-themed movie when I saw this film last Christmas (2008). I thought that with such a star-studded cast the film would be fantastic. What a huge disappointment! The film was full of opportunities but failed to follow-up in any meaningful way. I'm not against comedy (and comedy can be meaningful), but for the most part the jokes and physical comedy were rather lame. If you saw the promotional trailer, you saw the best this film has to offer. Save your money. It's not even worth watching on TV."
5,A new favorite!!!,"Four Christmases is hilarious and has quickly become a favorite Christmas movie in my house! Vince Vaughn, and Reese Witherspoon are great in this, love it!"
2,Predictable and not particularly funny,Not a movie I would watch a second time. A few funny moments but overall boring. Not a feel good holiday movie.
2,The dvd stopped in the middle and I could not see half of it so not satisfied with instant play. I do not think I should pay .,DVD stopped in middle and could not resume and only started over. Need work on the rentals. I do not feel obligated to pay rental.
4,Good Choice for a random pick!,"We didn't know what movie to choose and this is the one we picked. It was funny in the right spots and had a serious tone also. It was a different style of movie, but we really did enjoy it. We would definitely watch it again!"
1,Four thumbs down!,Awful movie!!! Rented it last night and wished I hadn't spent my dollar! Great cast of characters but the director and producer obviously didn't know what to do or where to go with their ideas. Tried to be funny and tried to be serious but failed at all attempts. If you want to see some really Christmasy movies Elf and Polar Express are must-sees! Leave Four Christmases on the shelf with the elf!
2,I Felt Like the Kid Who Got the Flashlight For Christmas,"Five Oscar winning actors in the cast and nothing to show for it. I was hoping for a flick that evoked the spirit of Christmas and received the proverbial lump of coal in the stocking. The humor is mostly derivative and unfunny. The best gag involves Robert Duvall's green shag carpetting in his living room. Shockingly Reese Witherspoon and Vince Vaughn are totally unappealing playing the worst kind of narcissistic yuppies imaginable. Vaughn should avoid holiday fare after this dreck and ""Fred Claus"". What saves this flick from the absolute nadir is the all-too-brief appearances of the aforementioned Duvall and Jon Voight. Do yourself a favor if you want a flick that better captures the spirit of the season is to check out ""The Holiday""...or ""Bad Santa""."
1,NOT a family film,"I love Romantic Comedies - this wasn't either.I did not make it through the first 5 minutes of this film. I had to turn it off and warn everyone it was nasty. Within the first five minutes, you have a sleezy bar scene where the main characters have a less-than-wholesome discussion (full of vicious put downs), the man Reese Witherspoon's character is supposed to fall in love with calls her a B**** and the next thing you know, they are in the next room with her legs locked around his waist and he has her up against a wall.I guess Hollywood thought a fade scene consists of what happened above followed by the couple exiting the room adjusting their clothes. NO class. If I could give it a negative 20 I would."
1,"Try: Holiday, Love Actually, Charlie Brown Christmas, Nightmare Before Christmas","Dreadful disappointment. Great idea, pathetic script and use of 'comic' violence. Cast andaudience poorly served. There are many alternatives and life is finite."
3,It's ok.,not special. Had a few laughs. This movie had a moral a little soapy. Don't need to see it twice.
2,"Terrible movie, not funny, Save your money","What a waste of money and now I see it's only $6.99. What a shame I spent $15.99 on it because the trailer looked funny. This money is a chore to sit thru. Reese is as darling as usual, but the script is lacking. I would not recommend it. My copy has been given away already to someone who wanted to see this movie because she likes the actors in it."
2,Four was a bore,Bored me to the point that I walked away. A shame as I love Vaughn and find he and Witherspoon both to be good actors. I was just bored with the storyline.
5,A true Lee Morgan Session,"It is a shame that an album like this would be overlooked and placed as a limited edition Blue Note album. Every song on this album is unique in their own little way and they are all truly brilliant. The line-up is enough to just go get this album, including Bobby Hutcherson, Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, Billy Higgins, Ron Carter,and of course Lee Morgan. This album mixes a little ballad with a lot of post bop, bluesy material. If you are familiar with Lee Morgan and his earlier work such as Leeway and Sidewinder, you should really check this album out. If not, I recommend strongly checking out stuff he did with Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers such as Moanin', or an earlier Lee album like Leeway. But anyways The Procrastinator should have not procrastinated this long. This is a masterpiece."
5,"Wonderful spicy, sweet flavor!!","Discovered this when our children brought it home the first time from Chiang Mai, Thailand. It is sweet with the wonderful Thai chili peppers infused into the sauce. Not ""screaming"" hot, but just right for those who like a bit of a ""kick"" to their sauces. Highly recommend for chicken. Also excellent on pork."
2,Not fun if you don't have a ramp,"There is no point of buying this toy if you don't have a ramp!Then all it does is go fast. Been there done that. The comercial says it can jump an airplane, ok.... where will you find an airplane? This toy only lasts for 1 day, then it gets worn out and goes slow. Then you can call them slow wheels! It's fun for the first day then it goes into the toy graveyard. I reccomend you use it a lot the first day because you will forget about the next day."
5,Best Lunch Container I've Ever Used,"I love this product! Its compact and handy, the portion control is great, I haven't had issues with leaks as long as I use the correct container, tt keeps hot things hot and cold things cold and it comes with chopsticks! Its perfect!"
1,dissapointment,"I don't think this product is for everyone. yes it does everything it's suppose to do, but if you're an American, working and living in a typical American city and office, bringing a HUGE food thermos to work is really a hassle and not very encouraged by colleagues. it's just weird. after reading the many rave reviews and the thought of saving money was very luring, i decided to buy one for myself. after a few times, it's just not worth the hassle. there's alot of washing to do when you're done eating. and when you're eating, either you lay out all the dishes or you eat them one at a time because you're too embarrassed. anyway, maybe if i work in an asian office this could be lunch time fun."
2,Lunch will be never boring,"Since I get Mr. Bento, every day lunch is much fun and health than I went to out eat. I lose 5 Ibs by bring my own lunch.The Jar can hold soup warm.Believe me for those people like bring their own lunch should have this lunch jar."
4,Great design and function - Read Manual,"Great concept. Works well with cold where the difference in temp is not too much.Step 1 - read the instructions and note that one of the tops is insulated and the containers above it are not fully protected by insulation.Great for keeping two dishes hot or cold (both) for a trip to the office, school or countryside. Works well for the daily lunch of salads and fruits or with warm dishes like soup or warmed leftovers.Recommended highly"
4,Nice product.,It's a nice container that lets you take a variety of food with you. I use it occasionally.
2,Easy to Clean Mr Bento Lunch Jar,"Although I like the set up of the lunch jar, I was disappointed in the size of the containers. They are much smaller than they appear."
2,Leaks,"My boyfriend bought this for me as a present, and I thought it was the most useful thing for bringing lunch to work. It was pretty useful if you don't bring anything soupy. My mistake was that I decided to bring soup to work one day, and thought the soup bowl was leak proof. Boy was I wrong, the jar fell over while i was driving to work, and my soup leaked all of my passenger seat."
3,Very cool to travel,Very nice for those who like to travel alwaysI think the small size and ease ofVery suitable for travelers
3,The containers are too small,I really wanted to love this but the containers are too small and the whole thing put together is too big for all the tiny food it holds. It is a giant pain and thus it sits in my kitchen not getting much use.
5,lunch,I like this bento lunch box. I have not put any soup in it yet. I love how everything fits seperate but together. Easy to clean and easy to use.
5,Excellent Item,"I purchased this item on a whim as one of her Christmas presents. Turns out, she enjoys this gift more than the others. She finds it to be very convenient and practical. She uses it everyday, and is able to pack both lunch and a mid day snack in the compartments. She absolutely loves it."
4,Very cool!,This is very cool. The only drawback is the largest bowl in the middle leaks easy. I had some salad with slight dressing and tuna and it leaked all over.
2,Extremely disappointing,I followed all instructions including filling containerwith hot water to warm it before packing lunch. Everythingwas cold to room temperature 3 hours later. Nothing here tojustify the high price or the amount of work to clean this thing. A big waste. Stick to heating your lunch in the microwave folks.
3,High quality,"I ened up not using this product and just giving it to someone. But the person I gave it to, thinks its great."
1,"I like Kathleen Turner, but this was a stinker","A appreciate the fact that Kathleen Turner is trying to get back into acting, after all her health issues, but this film was a real stinker. Amazon offered as a pre-release, so I spent the $10 to watch it.Bad acting, slow moving, predictable. Maybe for free, but I would not waste my time if I had it to do over again."
2,ThecPerfect Family,"A well-meaning but rather trite treatment of Catholicism, homosexuality and abortion. I would have thought it quite meaningful when I was still in Catholic school. Now, it seems like more sophisticated insights abound."
3,The older editions are better,"I have the third edition and the latest edition of this book. In my opinion, the later editions have been dumbed down considerably. In addition to developing the basics of vector analysis, the older editions included splendid discussions of curvilinear coordinates, tensor analysis and touched on differential forms (the wedge product being introduced). While the latest edition features appendices covering specific applications such as Maxwells and Navier-Stokes equations, the explanations are far too brief to be of much use. I suggest that interested parties attempt to get used older editions whose content were presumably under the control of Davis (not Snider) being much better written and probably less expensive. The older edition had few typos with very useful and entertaining problem sets. A better alternative book might be ""Vectors and Tensors in Engineering and Physics"" by Donald A. Danielson in paperback."
4,Worth it,"_Call Me_ is not a quick, lighthearted book to read, but it has depth and power. Liam's struggle is to grieve the loss of his lover without knowing how. The invention of Bike Boy and all his subsequent activities to me were painfully obvious attempts at keeping grief at bay: all of it seems designed to keep moving, keep talking, keep diverted, do anything except authentically mourn his loss.I thought Hartnett wrote a strong, moving novel about struggling, confused people. I doubt it will ever be a movie of the week starring Brandy, but that's only one of its selling points."
5,A VERY ENJOY ABLE READ,"This is the second part of the Anges Brown trilogy and as a general rule, the second offering is often times not as good as the first. In this case though, that does not hold true. The author follows his delightful characters, their ups, their downs, and skillfully blends relationships into a wonderful story of a family. As with the first book in this servies, I could hardly put it down. The author's humor and insight to human nature are truely a gift, one which I am glad he is sharing with us. These books have been out long enough now and have been successful enough to attract those few distractors who seem to take delight in casting stones at other peoples sucess. Pay them no heed. This is a delightful read, one you don't want to miss. Recommend this one highly."
2,Why did I buy this?,"I just don't get this. If you can listen to small 30 sections you can get some really great grooves and ideas, plus about one hundred 1980's cliches. Collectively these tracks don't gel - there's no cohesive them in each track. It's like these guys put together a million ideas in a hat and pasted them together at the mixing desk. I'll try and listen through a bit more in the hope that there's something hiding in this album."
3,A little too blah for me,"I think this novel would be good for someone that has grown up in a family situation composed of different cultures, but I found it to be a little extreme and exaggerated. Hey, maybe that's me being naive, but I did not enjoy it none-the-less.I read this book for my Women in Literature class, everyone seemed to have the same opinion of it ""The characters are developed extremely well, Gish Jen is very talented, it was somewhat of a page-turner, but wow, the subject was just..blah"" The central issue of the novel is the mixture of Chinese and American culture and what it can do to a family. Though some of the characters are quite funny, I would not read this book again."
5,INCREDIBLE,"I was shocked when I picked this cd up,because it's so much better than ""Ace""...This is one hundred percent pure dance energy,and the best vocal trance album to come out in years!If you like this check out 4 strings,lasgo,dj encore,and one of the best /original vocal trance albums...alice deejay's who needs guitars anyways?This is essential for any trance/dance lover."
5,"This is the best,most comprehensive tape I have used.","I have had three children and after each pregnancy, I have been a mess. This tape is perfect! It starts off with a beginner section that truly is beginner then moves on to two other levels. The levels give you something to shoot for without hurting yourself. She is very calm on the tape and doesn't look like a cheerleader."
5,Stanley putty knives,"Quality product at a fair price, I will definitely do business with them again.I received my order in a timely manner."
1,They're Back For A...HOLD IT!!! This Ain't The Right Movie. Shoulda Conned This Crap To The Fishes.,"The plot for this stinker looked promising: Doyle Lonnegan (played this time by Oliver Reed, as Robert Shaw had died a few years earlier) is out for revenge against Henry Gondorff and Joe Hooker. To complicate things even further, a tough guy named Macalinski (Karl Malden of TV's ""The Streets Of San Fransisco"") juicing up the works and a femme fatale (Teri Garr) having the hots for Hooker. It was written by David S. Ward, the writer of the Academy Award winning first movie. Only problems are...for some reason, Paul Newman and Robert Redford ARE NOWHERE IN SIGHT and instead, we got a fat comedian Gleason taking over as Gondorff and a lousy Mac as Hooker. Interesting premise...VERY LOUSY PICTURE. Stay away from this con artist job which should never have been made without Paul Newman & Robert Redford and stick with the original film. It's much better."
1,Lonnegan seeks revenge? He DIDN'T KNOW he was stung!!!,"This movie might have been ok if it was a story on its own, rather than trying to be a sequel to ""The Sting"". First off, how can you possibly replace Redford and Newman? Second and critical, which is really a non-negotiable fact from the first movie - Doyle Lonnegan did NOT KNOW he was stung by Gondorf and Hooker. How could he possibly be out for revenge if he didn't know? Plus, he saw them ""die"" just before he was pulled out of the club. Even if he realized that he was set up and taken, who would he go after - the dead guys? Changing critical facts from the first movie creates a sequel which makes no sense and does not deserve to associate itself with the original. If you pretend it's a totally unrelated movie with different character names, it's ok - but that's about it."
3,Does Crime Really Pay,"The boys are at it again from the original Sting movie. The bad guys are out for revenge having been stung in the first episode and the good guys are out to really sting them again. This film is not really a comedy but you cannot help but chuckle every so often as the plots unfold. The depression is over and evryone is looking to get a larger piece of the action and it is just one con after another to achieve that goal. This film will keep you trying to figure out just who is going to get stung in this thrilling sequeal, Sting II."
4,"If you love your animals, you must buy this!","Prayers for just about every creature's need -- whether wild or domestic -- can be found in this book. The prayers must have taken a great deal of time and caring to develop, as they are so complete and thoughtful. Your own pets will also find comfort in the words spoken. A beautiful book!!This book is full of biblical references on how God loves all living things and wants them to be safe and well. This book will bring comfort, encourage your faith and will be something you will want to share with others."
1,Did not last with my GSD,"I purchased this for my GSD 5month old pup.Within a couple of hour's of chewwing on it,it started missing piece's off of it.With my GSD,it did not stand up."
2,Nowhere near 'indestructible',"I ordered this product based on the description that it was 'indestructible' for even the strongest of chewers. My dog took all of 5 minutes to destroy it (he tore big chunks off and tried to eat them). I know that my dog is a particularly focused chewer, but this toy should never have been described as indestructible. Having said that, they were true to their promise of a complete refund."
2,Disappointed,"It is a good product, but my lab/border collie mix bit pieces off this ball the first day. It is my opinion that this ball would be better if it was just round with no middle indentation. The indentation gave my dog just the right place to start 'battle'."
5,Best Dog Toy for Big Chewers!,"These are the BEST! I have my dog, my son's dog and another dog I bought this for a gift and they all three loved them. Great Colors too! Would recommend this to big chewers."
5,An American Legend,"My brother recently died and he was a huge Dale Earnhardt fan. Well, I didn't really like him but because my brother did I decided to watch the movie. I loved it. I grew up around racing with my brother and don't live but about 5 miles from the Talladega track in Alabama. I highly recommend this movie."
5,Spiritual Nourishment,"While many of us stay active to keep physically fit, this book provides sustenance necessary to keep our spirit active. The book may be targeted for Roman Catholic youth, but anyone regardless of age who wants to grow in their walk with God & wants to learn more about the Catholic faith (including those who are physically active ;) would enJoy reading this. I love the analogy the author uses for the spiritual workout regimen: Cardiovascular (Prayer of Blessing & Adoration), Fat-Burning (Prayer of Petition), Muscle-Toning (Prayer of Intercession), Stretch (Prayer of Thanksgiving), & Breathe (Prayer of Praise). Just like working out can change the shape of your body, praying daily for fifteen minutes is enough to keep your Spirit in the best shape for life!"
4,"Zojirushi Classig 3 Container Lunch Box (Tiffin, Bento)","Terrific!While it appears small it holds more than enough for a grown man's lunch. The chopstick holders are very useful, the addition of a spoon would be nice because the bottom container is made for soup.Top container for your Meat, Substantial Vegetables or similar. The large middle is good for a salad or a main course of bulky food (I can even carefully fold 2 slices of bread into it). The bottom small bowl is great for desert or soup.Easy to clean, easy to carry."
3,Not bad,"This was a movie I'd never heard of. My husband found it on TV one day. I didn't want to watch it, but I did & I loved it. It's not great, but it is pretty funny in spots. I'd recommend it."
1,Death to the dog who took this product,I can't really said I was satisfied with this product since it led to my dog getting gravely ill and I had to put him down.
5,Epakitin for Dogs and Cats,"This product is amazing! My very sick elderly dog was hospitalized for kidney failure. He was not eating and lost weight. Along with daily hydrating him daily through his skin, his doctor suggested that I use Epakitin mixed in his food twice a day. He is like a different dog. I mix this in his food and he doesn't realize that it is in there. He's eating again, and he's gaining his weight back. I would highly recommend this product. Also this is a hard product to buy, so luckily I found it on Amazon. This was shipped in a timely manner along with a nice welcome from the supplier. I highly recommend this product and will be ordering this again."
1,prone to breakage,"I bought a plywood bit set with this bit in it. The 1st time I used it the carbide tip broke using it with a 1/8"" deep cut in oak. I returned the set and got a replacement. The carbide also broke on the 2nd bit. I was being careful after the 1st one broke. I would not get any CMT bits - go for Amana or another brand."
3,Could be better,"There were only a couple major prroblems that I had with this book.1. The author(Pickles is a Brit) didn't seem to be too happy about having to write about one of the greatest victories ever fought by the Army of the US. I could pick up on some disdain and contempt in his writings about Jackson's victory.2. The author kinda forgot to put casualty figures in the book.Other than those two big problems, I was happy with the book. As always, the Osprey company puts out a good product that is readable and to the point, with good solid info."
2,Not Very Good,"As other reviewers have mentioned, the author repeatedly shows his anti-American bias; why this is so is a mystery to me (it happened a very long time ago, chap, let it go). His description of the actual battle is too brief, and focuses almost solely on the operations of the British Army. For example, at one point he claims one of their units almost broke through, their opponents rapidly retiring. OK, which American unit(s)? What did Jackson do about it? Did they rally? If so, by whom?This is not to say the book is of no value; the detailed order of battle for the two sides is very nice, as are the maps, and his nuts-and-bolts description of how to navigate the battlefield today is very useful. The text itself, though, is a real disappointment. Osprey is usually very careful about the quality of their publications. How this snuck through is also a mystery to me."
1,Cheap packaged CD-R,"1 star here for the cheap package. The print-on-demand booklet look like it was made with my home printer. Pale colours, cheap paper. For that quality the price is much too high.5 stars for Hank's music"
1,Broken,"The hanger came broken, with one of the tie pins had broken off from the hanger. Very disappointing."
1,My Friend loved It...,"My best friend reccomended this book and said it was the best she'd read in awhile. Said there were parts that she could hardly relax in because of the anticipation of what was going to happen.I started the book, read 2 pages, fell asleep. It went on that way until I finished the book, and needless to say, I never found a good part, I just kept reading thinking it would get better.And it never did."
3,more than you know,It was a good book until the end. Did not like how it ended. It left you with a feeling that the aurther didn'mfinish the story.
4,"love, devotion and selfishness.........","Two tales of love, devotion and selfishness ,that occurred a hundred years apart, mirror each other in an amazing story. Beth Gutcheon weaves this novel carefully and with great patience. An elderly woman begins to reveal the story of her life during a memorable summer and suddenly you find yourself drawn into a tale that weaves past and present into an inescapable quest to understand the human heart in all it's vagaries. The mood is dark and intensely personal. The characters are raw and unrefined. The story twists the emotions and penetrates straight to the heart."
2,ditto to confusing and disappointing,"This is the first book of Gutcheon's I've read, and probably the last if, according to reviews, this her best book. I completely agree with the review titled confusing and disappointing...the parallel stories were intriguing but I thought there would be something in the end that tied it all together. But there was never any closure on the correlation between the two stories and really left me hanging. It had great potential but lacked the 'umph' to make it a great book."
4,"Good story, but slow read at times","I picked up this book on as a quick read and was caught into the story from the moment I got it. It was a great story with some great characters.At times I felt like I was very much into one of the storys of the time periods and then all of sudden it changed and I wanted to know so much more about what was going on with the other chacaters, but I was good and continued the story as it should have been.I loved Hannah's story the most all that had happen to her got me into it. The only bad part was towards the middle of the book the story begain to drag a bit for me but once I got past that it picked up and was a very quick read.I can't wait to read more by this author."
1,don't do it!,"Unless you are incredibly terrible with languages do not waste your money on this. It will not teach you anything very useful. You end up learning about 20 very basic phrases that are not so flexible in various situations. I recommend borrowing it from the library as a first step, to get used to danish pronunciation and purchase Bente Elsworth's Teach Yourself Danish."
3,Low -Fidelity 2CDs,"The other reviewer was happy with 10"" sound quality. Well I had some of this on 12"" and wasn't too thrilled with the sound. However the sound quality of the CDs is no worse than my recollection of the old 12 inch LPs - MORE WEST COAST JAZZ - and the misdated- STAN GETZ '57. Come to think of it this may have been recorded the way Norman Granz wanted it back in early 50's Los Angeles. The piano comes in well enough. The first 4 previously unreleased are the worst then it gets a bit better. STAN GETZ AT THE SHRINE with Brookmeyer actually has the better sound quality. To fill up the CD to almost 80 min. they include 2 of these studio tracks. Hear for yourself."
4,Ok Read,"A very good book about the British Empire and its affects on the natives of India and the imperial agents of Britain. If you have read anything else by Orwell then you know what to expect, a great book."
4,A Clear View Of Colonialism,"A very pointed, and probably accurate view of British colonial racism, and a good background for at least some of Burma's xenophobic attitudes that are finally starting to go away."
3,"Orwell Tries, But Comes Short","As I read this book, I felt that it was really dragging along. Although Orwell tries very hard to show the shortcomings of imperialism, the book will most likely turn off leisure readers. If you are really into a book taht contains means, and a deeper understanding, at the expense of being bored, this is for you. Many will like this book, but I feel that most will not."
5,Recommended for parents as well as students,"The Way We Really Are is recommended for parents as well as students of sociology and contemporary affairs: Stephanie Coontz provides an examination of America's changing families, from the different systems of cooperative and step-families to studies on changing traditional family methods and structures. An intriguing survey of family relationships is revealed."
1,Be afraid. Be very afraid. (of this book),"I think Ms. Coontz read way too much into the Chicken Little story. The sky isn't falling, it's just people throwing rocks at each other. She has certainly managed to tap into the ""it isn't my fault"" mentality so widespread on today's society. Why blame broken families on a lack of morals and poor personal choices, when we can simply say, ""Society made me do it.""Who knows? There may just be enough lost souls seeking to avoid blame and responsibility to make this a best seller. I, for one, hope not.Climbing back up a slippery slope is always a struggle, but that doesn't mean it can't be done or that we shouldn't try. Didn't your Mom & Dad always say, ""If your friends jump off a cliff, does that mean you should?"" Mom & Dad were right, you know. Ms. Coontz, on the other hand, would cheer you on as you to step into the abyss."
5,"Conservative, Comprehensive, Complete","This dictionary stands head and shoulders above all others I have used. If language is the life blood of culture, this dictionary shows just how far American culture has strayed from it's roots. Far from being archaic, this dictionary gives the objective definition of words, their etymology, and background in history. I found this book a breath of fresh air in an era of political correctness and subjectivism."
1,Disappointing,"This dictionary was recommended by so many, however it was difficult to read. Packaging was terrific, contents, not easy on the eyes."
5,Excellent investment,I herrd about this dictionary from my pastor. After just a few days of use I agree with him. No bible student should be without this reference. Look up the word law or God and see the difference.. Enjoy!
5,Sexy Disco,"Some great tunes remixed by Demitri from Paris...this gentleman has a keen ear for great disco era music and puts some really groovy ""spins"" on the re work!!! I'll definitly buy more of his work!"
4,Fresh sounds of new and old disco!,"Dimitri from Paris seem to have a habit of being able to pick out (or in Sacrebleu's case, create) infectious tunes that seem to stick in our minds and refuse to leave our CD changers. A night at the playboy mansion is no different in the way tracks 1 through 11 flow as if we're at a hip and underground party. However, the energy seemed to tone down during the last three tracks. Perhaps this was a way to relax after all of the floor stomping tracks of 1 through 11. However, I think a better way to wind down would have been through the use of more of Dimitri's own tracks. I hope Monsieur Dimitri decides to release a new CD of his own music soon. Sacrebleu is a classic, but I am thirsting for more."
2,What Funk?,"I bought this CD after reading the reviews which led me to believe that there was an equal amount of funk as disco. I was never a fan of disco but, I absolutely love funk. I'm afraid to say that there simply isn't any here. This CD was a real disappointment. I took it to the used CD store the day I bought it."
5,"Perfect rice, every time.","We do not eat much rice, but we like it to be well prepared when we do have it. After 2 years in Southeast Asia and 2 years in Northern Italy, we know good rice when we eat it. Previous rice cookers provided inconsistent texture, and normally had a hot spot caused crust on the bottom. This induction heated cooker gives us perfect rice every time. I expected a top of the line rice cooker from a high quality Japanese manufacturer to do a great job. I was not disappointed."
5,Very close to being erfect,"I am Asian and rice is my primary meal. I love rice and have eaten it all my life and I could tell when it's properly cooked. This rice cooker ROCKS! It would be perfect if it's made in a more contemporary exterior material such as stainless steel. I bought it along with a rice cooker recipe book, and have experimented with polenta, oatmeal, and some other meals other than just plain rice. So far I am very pleased with this cooker. It's very user friendly and clean-up is a breeze due the the excellent non-stick coating of the inner pot. If rice is important to you, then the extra dollar is definitely worth speding."
2,I don't get it...,"I'm still waiting for a funny line from this icon of comedy.After listening to it, and not laughing. I wonder if his lofty reputation is merely because he was persecuted and hounded so much for his so-called ""obscene"" language.I feel sympathy for the horrors he experienced, but I don't find his act to be funny in this cd."
2,"not so good, not natural enough","MM is of course a talented bass guitar player, but i would put a 'bemol' on this album: it looks like the recording technique was as for a pop music, meaning nobody plays together, just hearing a background and adding a solo track. It sometimes looks closer to bass technique tricks (with, yes, real good sound) than to real 'together playing'. In spite of all the great players that joined MM to do this album, (Maceo Parker, Wayne Shorter, Kenny Garret, Herbie Hancock, and many others... also Djavan...) I didn't catch the living presence of people in these arrangements and recordings with a kind of synthetic sugar-sound, making all musician too much faded and unpersonnal compared to their usual performance."
1,Terribly uncomfortable,"I can't tell you if this product works on wrinkles, in theory it seems it could give you a temporary mechanical ""lift"" of your wrinkles but I will never know. Suspecting that sleeping in them might be too annoying to do, I tried them during the day. That was it, I couldn't take it more than a morning and I had to rip them off my face. The pull and stickiness and stabbing sharp corners was so bad I couldn't take it and pulled them off and never went back to them. Therefore I could not stay with the product long enough to know if it works. If you think compliance will be an issue for you, might think twice about purchasing this product. I wasted my money."
3,Frownies,"I have sensitive skin and found that after sleeping with Frownies on nightly for about a week, developed a rash where I had applied them. I have not used them for a few days and there is still a rash. When it clears up, I might try to wear Frownies for a couple of hours only, or once every few nights. Beware, sensitive skin ladies!"
4,very comfy - don't like the band though,I think these are great underwear with a very nice feel. I don't like the band at the top much simply because it goes a little higher than a true bikini cut. Overall I definitely recommend this product.
1,Thr roaster oven that could'nt,"Just got it today. Very disappointing. Amazon site says it has preheat/on indicator light. I'm still looking for it. My other roaster ovens have solid feet. This has no feet. Only grommet like buttons that come out easily and don't push back in without a lot of force. Temp. control says it goes up to 450 degrees. It has been on 6 hours, and is touching about 420. Hamilton Beach must have sold out."
4,Quite a solid performer!,"I purchased this camera-printer set for my husband about a year ago. It's performed very nicely over the last 8 months. The only thing is that taking close-ups can be a little bit tricky and the battery life seems very short between charges. Otherwise, I would buy it again."
3,Too big,"I bought 2 of this type of camera for my uncle and mother. It was huge when I first opened the box. I would have rathered one a little more sleek. As far as the other options I have no idea for Ive never used it, but the size I can definitely comment on, its not a pocket or purse camera."
4,A touch slim,"I got this book because I have the first volume of the White Wolf Lankhmar series from a while back, but the rest of those volumes were hard to find. Not knowing where this edition split the stories, I started from the beginning. I fliped through the pages and confirmed that this book (and the second volume in this edition) add up to the whole of the first book in the White Wolf edition. This was a fair disappointment to me. It makes this series twice as expensive. Regardless, it is still the least expensive way to get good condition copies of these stories at a reasonable price, since any copy of these stories will be read over and over. I love the stories, I just think this particular edition could be plumped up a bit."
1,Awfull,"I agree with the revewer who said this book is amazingly bad, in fact it truly is awful. For example the following comes from pages 41-42: ""The members of the great families did not like to be alone. They traveled and dined with companions drawn from noble families. They always were accompanied by an armed body-guard of at least a half-dozen mounted soldiers, called knights.""This sounds like a childrens book not a serious history book. It contains almost nothing about John of Gaunt and rambles on about nothing in particular. It must have been written by Cantor when he was in his dottage and printed on the basis of his reputation. I too wish I could get my money back or at least sue the publisher for inflicting such a terrible book on the reading public."
2,Potboiler,"The author tells us little about John of Gaunt, but a lot about his personal inclinations. I quick read but with little substance."
2,Very disappointing!,"When I registered for a diaper bag, I wanted something that my husband could feel comfortable carrying around. This was good for that reason, and that reason only! The shoulder strap attachment ripped off, the middle zipper pull fell apart so I had to use a safety pin to keep it on, and I found the attached changing pad annoying. I never used it. I packed a portable one in the side pocket. By the time my son was 2 months old, the pad was too small and he didn't fit on it. Plus, it was difficult to position and use. I would definitely NOT suggest purchasing this product."
2,Great bag until you really use it!,"I received this diaper bag at my first baby shower and didn't really start using it until I went back to work and my baby went to daycare. I already decided that it was way too big for your everyday outings so I really never used it up until recently.When we started daycare, I packed it with diapers, extra clothes, bottles for the whole day etc... It was wonderful space-wise but the double zipper on the top was a pain!! It started jamming up and eventually just stopped holding the bag closed. I would not recommend this bag if you like the easy of just opening and closing a bag with one motion and the fact that the zipper breaks easily. I only give it 2 stars because of the space."
2,Too much like a brief case!,"Thought this bag would be big enough to hold it all. I soon realized that it is more of a tall thin briefcase than a diaperbag.Got a backpack instead that holds multiple bottles, formula and a few changes of clothes."
2,the Hummer of diaper bags,"This bag is big, bulky, holds a lot, is heavy, and not terribly stylish. I used it for the first year with my first child but wouldn't use it again in the future. I NEVER used the attached changing pad, it just added bulk to the bag. If you are going on a long excursion where you won't have a car nearby for your backup stash of supplies and need everything but the kitchen sink, this is a decent bag. But if you are looking for a daily-use bag that will see you and baby through running a couple errands, I'd shop around for something trimmer."
2,I wouldn't buy it again,"This is the only diaper bag I have used with my daughter, who is now almost 2 years old, because it's the only one I have. We've managed just fine, but with our second baby on the way, I am definitely ready for something different. The attached changing pad becomes annoying very quickly. It is almost impossible to use at most diaper changing facilities while you are out and about, and thus required me to pack a second changing pad. The changing pad also adds quite a bit of bulk to the front of the bag. The pad on the shoulder strap ripped off very quickly and the bag is not the easiest to carry around. I would also prefer something with a few more compartments to keep things separated inside. All and all, I would not recommend it."
2,The bag is heavy before you even start putting stuff in it!!,"I really liked my Eddie Bauer Bag in the beginning. The material holds up well. It is nice and roomy too! However, I soon realized that the bag is heavy when it is empty. It is a great strain on my shoulder. Also, the diaper changing mat that comes with it doesn't last long. My baby is now 5 months and is almost too big for it. I'm looking into buying a backpack and a larger changing mat."
4,A GREAT BAG,WE REALLY LIKE THIS BAG...I ESPECIALLY LOVE THE DIAPER CHANGING STAION ON THE FRONT. IT IS BIG ENOUGH TO HOLD EVERYTHING YOU NEED; YET NOT OVERLY HUGE. IT IS VERY DURABLE AND EASY TO CLEAN. I HAVE FOUND IT TO BE A GREAT LITTLE BAG.
3,spell-check now!,"I agree completely with the reviewer from Providence, RI. However, I place the day-glo inks as the SECOND most noticeable flaw. The first is the misspelling of SMITHSONIAN on the spine."
3,Notes perfume,"I like this perfume somewhat, it is a risk to buy perfumes without having a trial smell before purchasing. It has a bit of a stale scent, as if it's been affected by time since it was innitially bottled, I don't know what it is exactly. I have had better experiences with purchasing perfumes over the net."
3,Rise of Nazi power in Europe/ Historical Fiction,"Though I enjoyed book one, Vienna Prelude, I bogged down quickly in Prague Counterpoint and had difficulty finishing it. It was very sad and depressing. I decided it was not a winter book, and I will wait until spring to get back to the rest of the Zion Covenant books. I do think that the Thoenes did wonderful research, and that we need to be reminded of what happened leading up to World War II. I do not mean to be negative about the book. It was just hard to read the terrible things that happened to the Jews in Europe prior to WWII."
1,Will never know,"I`ll never know how this tv was.It arrived at my house with the screen shattered.Maybe it was the white glove delivery service amazon promised,which was a trucking co.that could`nt drive and had not strapped the box in the truck.The box slid allover the truck on the way here.Then it took over a month to get my money back.I would highly recommend buying a big item like this close to home."
5,A Great Buy,"I spent many months researching Plasma TVs on the Internet and in Consumer Reports. Panasonic always ended up being the best. So I bought the TH-50PX60U and couldn't be happierThe picture quality is excellent when viewing High Definition and is near CRT quality when viewing Digital Cable TV. The sound quality is also very good.I was told that the first 100 hours are critical in preventing burn-in on the screen. If you view the TV with the picture intensity set too high, burn-in damage might occur. So I decided to set the picture to the following settings:Picture: 0Brightness: 0Color: 0Tint: 0Sharpness: 0Aspect Ratio: FullI tuned the TV to a 24-hour movie channel and let the set ""slow cook"" for 100 hours.I feel that the set has been broken-in correctly and all is well after 3 months.I am very satisfied with this purchase."
4,Suspenseful,"""Bride of Pendorric"" definately has similarities to DuMaurier's ""Rebecca,"" but it has elements all its own. I enjoyed the twisting plot and the book's FABULOUS climax...you'll never guess it! It is truly reminisent of the gothic novel. The characters are actually quite complex in this story, something that I don't often see in romance novels. If you liked DuMaurier's ""Rebecca"" or any other Victoria Holt novel, there is a good chance that you will like this book. I couldn't put it down once I began to read it. It is definately worth a few hours of your time."
5,I love Victoria Holt,"This was the first Victoria Holt gothic romance I ever read and I am currently reading it for the 2nd time and I am enjoying it immensely. It is just a great read full of suspense and mystery and vividly written like all of Miss Holt's books. You must treat yourself to it. Also highly recommended are Mistress of Mellyn, On the Night of the Seventh Moon, Kirkland Revels (EXQUISITE) and Menfreya in the Morning. No one writes like her anymore and these books can be treasured for years to come."
5,Perfect,"I love love love Victoria Holt ! This book was awesome. The story was great. If you enjoyed Rebecca by Daphe Du Maurier, you'll love this book. The twist in this story was huge, surprising, and unexpected. I didn't see it coming and I would've never guessed that it would be like that. This was a great book with incredible mysteries, suspense, and twist. Read it you'll enjoy it."
2,Need to buy stock in Batteries,If you want to keep it working. The Batteries don't last...the doll uses batteries like crazy. I make sure it's turned off. The batteries only last a few days....then need replacing. I have tried every brand of batteeries.
5,truly magical,"I searched for this version of the story for years... literally... my children are now 13 and 14 and have never seen it! The story itself is brilliant, but with the music, songs, animation and narration makes it a truly magical feeling inside you when viewed with friends and family."
5,Excellent!,"So happy to receive this video, it is the most beautiful animated version of this story by Oscar Wilde and I am so grateful that I could access a rare copy of it through Amazon as it is no longer available."
1,Not Appropriate for 3 year old,"I bought this book for my 3 1/2 year old son based on the very favorable reviews and the fact that it is a classic. My son was terrified by this book. He cried when the ducks that were late getting on the boat were spanked for being late. He cried even more when Ping was captured by the little boy and the boy's family said that they were going to eat Ping for dinner and Ping was confined under a basket. We had to read through the whole book so I could show him that Ping was not killed, not eaten, and was reunited with his family; although, he was spanked for being the last duck on the boat (which resulted in more crying). He told me to throw away the book and never read it again. I would wait until around age 5 to introduce this book. It's definitely not appropriate for a 3 year old."
5,A dear remembered friend,"This wonderful story has now come through four generations of my family. It was the first book I remember and my sister and I asked for it every night. It's a timeless classic. Beautiful, soothing, a bit scary, emotional and oh so true to life. Consequences of actions, survival, and welcome home to the nest. All these deep human issues are presented by a very human duck. The prose has a lovely rhythm to it, perfect for reading aloud at bedtime."
1,"Terrible, Unkind, Abusive.","I bought this book because it comes up on Amazon as an additional suggestion when I type in ""Corduroy,"" which is, perhaps, the sweetest children's book ever. Well, when ""Ping"" arrived, I was sadly stunned. ""The Story About Ping"" is about animal cruelty, abuse, and injustice. Thankfully, my husband ""read"" it first with my son, and he just looked at the pictures without reading the words. When my husbdan told me later to look it over, I did and was horrified. We threw this book away immediately."
5,We HEART Ping,"...what more can I say. My mom was a preschool teacher and introduced me to this book when I was around 4 and now I've introduced it to my 6 yr old step-daughter...she begs to take it everywhere with her. It's a very simple story but some of the terms/words may be difficult for the younger audiences to grasp. If you like Chinese Folktales (or folktales in general) this is the book for you!! Also, check out Tikki Tikki Tembo...the best Chinese folktale ever concocted!!"
2,The Attack,This book was ok but not reverting. When I started reading it I seemed like it would be good but there seemed to be a lot of lectures through out the book which I found boring and started skipping parts. The main character seemed to have heaps of issues and seemed unable to ask for help to get through his problems with out inflicting pain on himself. I thought the book left a lot of unanswered questions as well. The subject matter was interesting but as another review suggested I thought this was pro Palestinian. Maybe I need to do some research into the back ground of the author to get more context and to see where he/she was coming from. Overall not really an enjoyable book and not really well written. This could be because it was a translation.
3,Greatest crime novel ever? Not!,"Dennis Lehane described this novel as the best crime novel ever written. I found it to be a dull series of conversations between wise guys with no plot to speak of. He said ""You'll be surprised at the ending"" but easily I saw it coming. I read about this novel when the Brad Pitt movie ""Killing Them Softly"" came out (written by the same author). Now I know why this movie didn't do well."
5,It Just Cracks!,"This work just cracks with great dialogue, interesting characters, and a fantastic story. It is as good as any modern thriller and set up a whole genre. This classic of crime should not be missed!"
3,Great if you have tentacles for fingers.,"Nice cut resistance. Defends agains my very sharp Japanese steel. The big downside is fingers are way too long. I bought a smallest size and the fingers are still 3/4"" too long. The awkwardness of the extra fabric in the fingers presents more of a danger when cutting than not using the glove at all. Too annoying for everyday use. So I only pull it out when shucking oysters or doing a Michael Jackson impression."
3,Latin not translated leaves ?,"This is a long ranging story about post nuclear disaster world where the monks have retained the few scraps of pre-trepidation literature still left after the purge. Over the centuries that follow, the civilization begins to return and the order wrestles with the questions of the need to save knowledge for the future until the nuclear age again arrives. This is a thoughtful and well paced story. My problem with it is the lengthy lapses into Latin, a language I have no knowledge of or interest in. I felt left out and somewhat discriminated against by my protestant upbringing. Perhaps had I read the book and been able to skip over the lengthy Latin verses, I would have enjoyed the story more. I do feel that the Latin was not then translated to let me in on the content and that I must have missed many points and observations that one familiar with the language will enjoy."
2,I wanted it to be so much better,"Honestly, I thought it was boring. I didn't care about any of the characters - mostly because they weren't around long enough to develop into anything worth caring about. It is an interesting premise but this book was like going to a lecture on a fascinating topic given by an extremely boring person. It took something that could have been interesting and instead made it dull.I like to read and re-read many books, but I won't be re-reading this one."
4,A Cold War Parable Woth Reading,"The threat of total nuclear annihilation is not as omnipresent as it was when this book was written but the themes and story are still worth reading even today. Most sci-fi of this period deals with nuclear war so it is an overused trope of the genre but it is used in a novel way. The rebirth of the monastic system as a venue to protect the knowledge of the destroyed civilization is a great concept. This book is not technically a true novel but more like a trilogy of novellas showing the rebirth of civilization from the view of the abbey of St. Leibowitz and the struggle between science, religion, and politics. This struggle is the part that is most pertinent to today's readers. It provides no easy answers but provides interesting questions."
4,"Good, but......","I hope this doesn't give people the message science is bad. I think the book says science is a morally ambiguous tool. Need all sorts of voices in this world. This book may weird you out, but celebrate the diversity in the world. Good to hear alll sorts of voices in science fiction, besides techno-worshippers & luddites."
1,Awful book,"Don't know why this is a ""classic."" I read this in a science fiction class. EVERY student in the class hated it as compared to liking everything else we read."
1,You cannot judge this book buy its cover!,"TIME magazine, February 22nd, 1960 said Miller's dedication is ""a scratch where it itches"", and intellectually speaking, so is his book. Also claimed to be ""a dull, ashy writer"". Doctor George Kumler Anderson, in his ""THE LEGEND OF THE WANDERING JEW"": too formless to be satisfying."
2,Yawn.,"It may be a classic of SF, but I could not get through it. Found it dull and gave up about 1/2 through."
2,Worth a Read... but Just One,"While I don't regret picking up the book, I just didn't find it the page turner that some do. It seemed disjointed to me and when I finished the book I felt unfilled. While I can appreciate Miller's struggle with reconciling science and religion, the final product didn't deliver as I had hoped."
1,Plodding and pointless,"Nothing really happened in this book, and that includes the nuclear war. Divided into three parts, the first involves the story of a young monk discovering some of the artifacts of the title character centuries after the apocalypse. Unfortunately, it takes 120 pages to convey what could easily have taken ten or less. The second part, set centuries after that, has an argument with no winner. Nothing besides that happens, including the land war among the barbarians. The third part, set centuries after that, shows that society built itself back so well after the apocalypse that another nuclear war is looming. Something finally does happen here, and by this time you're rooting for the apocalypse. The story did come full circle and showed the church as the antagonist, but a nihilistic story with no protagonists at all does not make for a good read."
2,"fantastic story idea, too bad ........................","i have been reading sci fi for about 35 years . i think my first read was star beast by heinlein. as the years have passed i have found that i tend to be drawn to the ""classics"" in sci-fi, at least stuff written prior to the 80's with thAt in mind i thought i would read canticle, heard much about it , just never picked it up. it was a struggle to stay interested in the storyline. i guess i was expecting something more entertaining, there are several good meaty ideas brought up during the read but i felt the book could have either been done with about half as many pages as it is or else add something more to the story line. in a nutshell, boringly long stretches of blah blah ba blah blah. i'm glad i read it but i had to work hard to suck the juice out of this book. it most definately was not a ""page turner"" i kept falling asleep trying to get thru it"
1,I Didn't Like This Movie!,I watched this movie called Water and I hated it and thought it was terrible and BORING and it just wasn't funny at all. I like Michael Caine but I thought his talents were wasted in this movie! The only good things about this movie are the beautiful Carribean Island location and the reggae music which is one of my favorite kinds of music but the plot doesn't do justice to the location and music!
4,learning to engrave,"An excellent production, with exceptional workmanship to provide high quality photo's. The anatomy section is more for the artistic crowd then the hard metal group. Would have liked to see more information on making the cuts and shading, as well as depth control and designs. Overall a good learning book with great coverage of making the proper tools and maintaining them"
2,This broke immediately,Very cute but unfortunately it is cheaply made. The handle broke immediately. Be aware that it is very tiny too.
5,Great Unknowns,"Roy Buchanan was one of the best axe slingers of all time.Why he never got the reconition he truly deserved is beyond comprehension.I've had this album for a couple of years,and it sounds as fresh today as it did when i first bought it.From the title track (When a guitar plays the blues),to the last song on the album (hawaiian punch).this album is great.Being the first album that ROY produced and mixed himself,he said it felt like it was his first recod.And in his own words,this album is really me.he also thought this was the best album he had ever released.If you like great blues then this is a must own album."
2,"not the same ""The Need"" as albums ""The Need is Dead"" etc.","I mistakenly purchased this album looking for albums by the group ""The Need"" who have produced the albums ""The Need is Dead"" and ""The Need"".Given that that was what I was looking for, I'd rate this album at a 2 - not horrible, but it just wasn't what I was looking for."
4,Cleverly Written and Enjoyable History of Scotland,"Many history books have the bane of being perceived (rightly and wrongly) of being bland and tedious. However, this book breaks that notion apart by making Scotish history easy to understand and fun via the clever writing style and cartoons. To paraphrase the back of the book, when one reads this book, one will wonder why he/she ever thought history was boring."
1,Terrible at best.,"I came across this book while searching for a book by Sylvia Browne. So I ordered based on the reviews. It was TERRIBLE at best. If I could give it a minus -***** (minus 5 stars) I would.I also went to the website of this ""Supposed Healer,"" and ""Worker For God."" Well, low and behold there you can buy your ""Healing"" from her right under her COUNTRY MUSIC CD for sale. So I ask myself what or who is this woman? A healer? A country music singer? A psychic? A phrophet? She claims to be all of the above and then some. The possibilities are limitless. There is no doubt that Tiffany Snow is a legend, a legend in her own mind that is."
3,LOVE TIFFANY SNOW,"Although I love Tiffany Snow and love her books I have to say this book was awesome but I found a lot of repeat stuff in it from her previous book 'Psychic Gifts in the Christian Life"". So definitly read Tiffany Snow's books but between this one and the ""Psychic Gifts"" book, you only need to read ""Psychic Gifts"" to get the information you need to change your life. There is more information in this book but not as much as in ""Psychic Gifts"" which I think is the better and more informative book with all new information. God bless Tiffany Snow and her work and I pray to God she keeps on doing what she does for so many and the world is a much better place for having her in it."
4,O2 sensor,I bought this o2sensor for my eclipse gst due to my car wouldn't pass smog. So far so good it did the job I passed smog the only reason I didn't give it a five star it's cuz I had to wire it to my plug which it wasn't hard. You have to do that to most sensor. So overall it's a good sensor
4,Gift,It was a gift. On my sister Amazon wish list. She was really happy when she opened her birthday present.
3,Organizer,"This really did work for my entry way, however, it was alittle hard to install you might need an extra hand to help you. Someone has to hold the holder while the other person hammers in the nails. But it is on the heavier side but its works well."
3,Confusing,This movie seemed to confuse me from the beginning and would never let up. I was unsure if this was a drama or some sort of dark comedy. Something worth a second look at most definitely.
1,Worst Cage film ever,"I am a Nicholas Cage fan, with all of his quirkiness and odd stuff he does, but this movie sucks,is boring, and not worth a free watch. Did i say very boring.If you want a movie to go to sleep to this is the one."
4,"Good Movie, but slow in some parts","when i saw this movie at the theater, i wanted to be an ambluance driver!! i guess it was one of those movie that make the profession look a lot more exciting than it really is (aka twister).the movie itself is a good drama, although it does get a LITTLE slow (not too bad) the camera angles are great and the acting is superb. the DVD has some interviews but that's about it when it comes to extra features. overall, it's a good drama about paramedics."
5,BETTER.YES BETTER.THAN TAXIDRIVER.You fogeys you.,"I really hope you saw Bringing Out the Dead while it was in the theatre. I just saw it and thought it was most excellent. Truely a Martin Scorsee film. Impossible not to compare it to Taxi Driver and it stands up to it. Same beautiful cinematography. New York city night street scenes. Nicolas Cage is no Dinero but then again he is Cage and that works for me. He plays disturbed/deranged SO well. The music worked well too. I may have to get the soundtrack. Lot of nice blues but some rockers too, the tunes fit the scenes well. The Janis scene is a hoot. Some of the dialogue is brilliant and obviously taken straight from the book. I have to read it now. I recently saw Taxidriver again and don't think it ages well. A bit of a sacred cow perhaps. I am buying BOTD on DVD and putting it on the shelf with Casablanca and Mars Attacks."
1,The danger of retreads,"Director Martin Scorcese and screenwriter Paul Schraeder revisit the territory that, in their youths, they brilliantly explored together in ""Taxi Driver"" -- the streets of Hell's Kitchen, NYC. Unfortunately, this time they should have stayed home! We get the same old lowlifes and trapped working class we had in ""Taxi Driver,"" with no compelling story line and no fascinating inner compulsions, and no hint of the economic boom that today is transforming Times Square from devil's den into Disney's playpen. Nicholas Cage, John Goodman, et al, are talented, and the emergency lights streaking down the rain-slicked streets make for lush visuals, but this movie just drives around in circles, looking for a reason to live."
2,rent it... and rent a backup while you're at it,"well, i hate to be the wet blanket of the bunch. everyone seems to love this movie, but i am not as taken by the quirkish effects. i see (and appreciate) the underlying message of the film, and i'm glad to have watched it; but the experience came at the price of 2 hours of boredom. i kept saying to myself ""it's GOT to pick up soon"", and hoping it would get better - then the credits started rolling. the movie was more message-driven than plot-driven, and while the stop-frame effects helped build feel & atmosphere, they came off as cheap and unoriginal. i love offbeat movies (pulp fiction, being john malkovich, high fidelity) but this one left me totally unsatisfied. think twice before plunking down that credit card - go rent it first (on a night when there's NOTHING ELSE to get!)"
1,Disappointed,"First off, I make very few purchases on line. Purchased this item based in a large part by the positive reviews in Amazon. When I received this item, I found that the programs it contained did not function as advertised. Found something better and have not used this product since its inital tryout. I wish I had not purchased it."
5,every american should read this book,"addicted to war is written in the form of a comic book but packs an amazing, life changing message.it tells you what you already knew in vague terms but puts it powerfully together. the economy of the united states is a war making machine that spreads death and destruction around the world and neglects the basic needs of our citizens at home. this is a book that you will read and give to others to read. Buying it was the best penny i ever spent."
4,Clever and very comprehensive,"Loaded with facts but in a comic strip format, this can be enjoyed as good writing, good artwork, and political thesis.What got me early on, is *how many* conflicts have occured...and how many could have been negotiated out of existence. This early edition ends with a resounding ring, as the 2003 ""Slam-Dunker"" team at 1600, came up with one a little too convenient for the Military Contractor, which once baosted a certain Dick as ex-CEO.Just one glaring and irresponsible entry, to take away a FIVE rating: painting a picture of Israel as just another aggressor nation because it has hung onto territory gained following a massive attack by closeby neighbors."
3,Advanced for me....,"I do not know how to speak Portuguese. After receiving this CD and book, I can say a few things...Thank you, please, good morning. When listening to this CD you need to have the book in front of you or at least read the chapter before listening to the lesson. I wanted something I could listen to in the car and be able to repeat the words.... There is no pause for me to say the word after it is said in Portuguese.I will look for another CD book combo to learn Portuguese and keep the Teach Yourself Portuguese Complete Course (book + CD pack)for when I am more advanced and can follow what is being said."
3,Teach yourself Portuguese,The package contains one book plus 2 CDs. The quality of the sound in the CDs is not as good as Plimseur Brazilian Portuguese. The good thing is that you have the book and can see how the words are written in Portuguese.
2,Here comes Sooooooper-Storm!,"Childish and formulaic writing troubles this novel, which abounds in cliches that you usually encounter from first-time romance writers. You have the typical heroine who can do almost anything, with her catlike eyes of unusual hue and her ability to wrap absolutely everyone and everything around her, like some kind of tremendously powerful magnet. Friends and enemies alike come to adore her. She comes to the rescue time and again, until you roll your eyes by the time everyone is singing her praises. And only one thing keeps the story going through all of this--the oldest cliche of all: The Hero Who Just Can't Seem To Get The Words ""I Love You Too"" out. Been there, done that a hundred times before, and sometimes, a heckuva lot better than this effort."

4,Shango/Django?,"from what i heard this can only be the start of something big. trad jazz (eg Thad Jones & normal 3/4-tets must be paying Jimmy Smith & Captain Jack the same dues finally that Joey DiFrancesco is getting, playing also cornet, because this organ stand-in ""six string bass"" guitar is using what rock has dropped for decades - WAH-WAH pedal as a judicious organ stop. This is no acid jazz, this hip rhythm collective reaches back to the original rhythm section of the standard trio to pull out some funk & rescue the lowly hendrix pedal from oblivion. No label, this is straight ahead. i followed it up from Christian Jacob/Steve Swallow, another rock transfer (Chuck Mangione, or was it ""Larry Coryell""?), & can only describe what can't be summarized - listen w/ caution, it is uncommon rare."
4,This little puppy cooks,"In a seems like never ending swamp of poular music that catches us wading through the Blowfishes and the Matchboxes and tripping on an occassional master such as Eric Clapton it is so very nice to go back and hear a true ole' master such as Johnny. This man is so underrated that it actually brings tears to the eyes. Well, a true bluesman dies unheard of anyway...I guess. I, for one, will never forget how this man can ""smoke"" a guitar bridge if it is acustic, electric or steel and hold his own with anyone whether dead or alive. It is no wonder that Mr. Winter's dedication to the heart throbbing musicianship that belongs to those married to the blues catapulted a young bassist like Tommy Shannon (plays here) into Double Trouble and bumming around with the late great Stevie Ray. After listening to this recording there will leave little doubt that Johnny Winter can reign supreme with anyone mentioned in the list of ""greats"". Play on Johnny...."
3,"Good tales, needs proofreading","This book delivers what you'd expect--a People magazine look at baseball history. There are some fine stories about colorful players, but on every other page, something missed by the editors will jump out at you and scream ""didn't anyone proofread this thing!""If you don't mind reading an unpolished book, it may not bother you. But knowing that fans of baseball books are by and large sticklers for detail and statistics, this book could have been much, much better with only a little more cleaning.Once you get past that, and the fact that you won't find any statistics to speak of, it's a fun read. Get it for the bathroom."
1,Not for the Tender Headed,"We bought it based on all of the five star reviews, but are so disappointed in it. My 7 year old has nearly waist length hair and a very tender head. Yes, it is true that it gets the tangles out, but the pain is worse than any brush. It is bulky and awkward to hold. The teeth on it are made out of hard plastic, so if it touches her head or back she cries. The Tangle Tamer vibrates to help remove the tangles, so it grabs her fine hairs and pulls so hard that it snaps and breaks the strands. We used it 3 times before I gave up. I wouldn't recommend it."
4,Neat,I never knew something like this existed. I'm white with straight but very thick hair. It gets matted every night while I am sleeping. Not just knotted. I have a very sensitive scalp so frequent brushing causes me pain. This is a great alternative that really work! I am so happy to have found this.
1,Baaad!,"It's really bad product, not doing anything really... I would have return it if I wouldn't already throw away the packaging. Totally not worth the money!"
5,Amazing!,"I got this on the recommendation of another mama of a curly haired girl. My three year-old has Shirley Temple ringlets and I always hesitated to comb them out because I wanted the curl to keep it's integrity, but at the same time it would get so knotted. We got this and have used it on wet and dry hair. It glides through the tangles like butter, and my daughter loves the way it feels. I've used it on my own waist length, wavy hair which gets super knotted after being in a messy bun atop my head and it works like a dream! Love this product!"
5,Best of the genre,"Slice o' life. Not too heavy, not too light. Absolutely believable. Very moving, but doesn't pander to cheap emotionalism. Even the dialogue is recognizable as something you might actually hear in real life. Substitutes a story for the usual violence, sex and high-decibel action. Acting, character presentation superb. For those not too cynical to enjoy a great, yet realistic feel-good movie, this is a good one. I use other high-rating picks of Amazon Five-Star reviewers of this movie as a rough guide for evaluating movies I haven't seen."
5,Roy Rogers 20 Movie Pack,Enjoyable collection of Roy's movies. Quality was better than I expected except one out of my three DVD players could not open one movie. What ever happened to the simple turn on and play system?
1,Ripped Off,This Roy Rogers 20-Movie collection is supposed to be Closed-Captioned for the hearing impaired (as indicated in the product description). I did not find it to be so. This happens a lot. DVD's are advertised as Closed-Captioned and then I find that they're not.Another rip-off. I know it's not Amazon.com's fault or that of the distributor. Who else to blame? It's very frustrating.
3,finger-popping pop tune!,"this is a good tune, featured in the film 'empire records' and now, on its own. collins has a nice, whiskey soaked bass that is redolent of david bowie. the track itself features jangly vibes and the thick handclaps that are a hallmark of motown at its finest.this song is perfect for a cool jerk or a hot frug.dance it out and don't spare your soles!"
1,Power Tech Dune Cruiser,I purchased this item for my 5 year old who was very excited.The control unit burned out within 20 minutes of operation. I called theirsupport number and another unit was shipped from Korea. The second controlbox stopped working withing 5 minutes of operation.[...]I will not recommend this product based on my experience. Unfortunatelythere isn't a lower rating.
3,Thorn Resistant Tubes,"Bought this tube for the front tire on my Rans recumbent. The tube is much thicker along the outside diameter and is significantly heavier than standard tires. I decided not to mount due to the weight, didn't want that much rotating weight in a tube, and installed a standard thickness tube instead. I also installed a Primo Comet Kevlar tire and hope that the tire alone will give me the desired puncture protection.The tire might be great for a kids bike or other application where weight isn't a issue."
2,Maybe it will grow on me...,"I am a huge Tori Amos fan so I expect new and different things from her, but she went a little too far with this album. Other reviews have stated similar opinions, so I won't go into detail. ""'97 Bonnie and Clyde"" is the best song, while her butchering of ""Happiness is a Warm Gun"" is obscene."
3,(and 3's not a bad rating),"This is definitely not like anything Tori has ever done. It's an entire album of OTHER PEOPLE'S SONGS. Written by men to be exact. I guess this is some kind of statement or experiment. Other people have done covers records and done quite well with them (Cat Power's ""The Covers Record"" comes to mind). I don't know where this one is headed. Some of it is really quality, ""Real Men"" and ""Time"" in particular, but some of the material grates on the nerves (""Happiness Is A Warm Gun""). And then there's the stuff that just plain shocks, like her Eminem cover. Its harrowing delivery brings to mind ""Me And A Gun"" from her debut album. It's not my favorite Tori album, but it's TORI all the way, and she really can't do anything truly bad."
2,What a disappointment,"As a huge Tori Amos fan, I was really excited to find out that Strange Little Girls arrived. On the first listen, I thought, ""okay, maybe it needs to grow on me"" but after several listens, I can still find no other conclusion: Miss Amos has finally gone out of her freaking mind, and we're all being subjected to some terrible delirium she is suffering. I mean, come on, a song about a man who kills his wife and talks to the children about how mommy wants to go for a swim? I was prepared to deal with Tori's often-controversial subject matter, but that song really disgusted me. I couldn't even enjoy it for it's artistry, because it had none!!! This album is total (...). As much as I've loved Tori through her many experiments and changes through the years (Boys for Pele was a big stretch, but I've come to love it also), I simply could not stomach this terrible failure any longer. I will think twice about buying any future albums of hers."
1,Where's the talent?,"Her first CD was fantastic, and everyone after that alright but not as great as the one that preceeded it. However, even if it wasn't good music, it was _her_ music. Now, she's just doing covers. I didn't recognize a lot of the songs, so I can't compare, but none of her takes on them made me want to go out and listen to the originals, either. They're mostly very slow songs; it was her fast-paced songs with brilliant lyrics that made me love her in the first place. Certainly, it wasn't her voice. Not that she has a terrible one, but I don't want to pay money to listen to her use it to recite every song she can her talentless hands on. As the old commerical went: Where's the talent?"
2,Unworthy of Tori Amos,"This album was a huge disapointment. The songs don't began or go anywhere, and they are dry and boring. The music, everything is underdevoleped and seem to be fillers. This is my least favorite album of Tori's, and is not even worth buying in my view. It seems they took all of her rejected songs, and created an entire album composed of filler songs, instead of being put out ontoan other albums. I suggest buying Little Earthquakes for a music fan."
2,SO disappointing..,"I have all of Tori's albums, and it seems like ever since the Choirgirl Hotel she's gone downhill. Venus was alright, but this is just awful. At first when I heard she was going to do covers, I thought ""Hey - not bad! I love Smells like Teen Spirit and Famous Blue Raincoat, this probably won't be so bad."" But the album is devoid of emotion as well as any resemblance of the Tori we used to know. The only songs worth listening to on this album are Real Men and for a listen or two '97 Bonnie and Clyde. Some of the other songs are a good effort, but they honestly just fall flat. Don't waste your time on this. If you're looking for a Tori album to buy, start with Choirgirl or any of her earlier stuff."
2,o.k.,"I think Tori Amos is a very talented artist. This collection of songs doesn't necessarily back up that statement. Songs such as ""Strange Little Girls"" and ""Rattlesnakes"" shine and sound as though she wrote them herself, which is a good thing since they seem to be the most Tori-like songs on this project of cover songs. They are also the most effective. The track that seems to be getting a lot of attention is ""Bonnie And Clyde '97"". It is very disturbing and violent and almost caused me not to want to go any further into her CD (it is track #2). It is not at all easy to listen to unless you enjoy listening to Tori talk about murdering a child's mother, from the father's perspective. Overall, the CD is disappointing with a few good moments."
2,Disappointing,"As a fan of Tori Amos, I was excited to hear she had a new album out. What a letdown. A big part of Tori's appeal, as evidenced in her previous work, is her ability to write unique, moving lyrics and accompany them with talented piano playing. Unfortunately, Strange Little Girls offers none of these things. SLG is just Tori, singing along to a collection of songs written by other artists. Let's hope this isn't the beginning of the end of this gifted artist's career."
3,not like her other albums,"I'm a pretty big fan of Tori Amos, but I had to try quite hard to like this. It starts off well with ""New Age"", being one of the better songs in the album, along with ""Enjoy the Silence"" and ""Rattlesnakes"". ""97 Bonnie & Clyde"" reminds me of ""Me & A Gun"", but I think the latter is powerful and disturbing in a much more unique way...""97"" is just plain freaky. The arrangements and piano work is not as impressive as her other albums; it sounds like she was rushing to get the songs recorded. I listened to ""From Venus and Back"" the other day, and it had many greater moments. Hope she comes up with new original stuff soon to make up for this release."
3,Tori Amos fan yawning just a little bit...,"So, I'm one of those Tori fans who buys every album the day they come out. I'm also incredibly used to the melancholy whispers that creep into much of her music. However, this time, as much as I hoped for an occasional sweeping tune, or a little uptempo vibe, I found myself haunted (and not in a good way) by these somewhat bizarre covers. And no, the Eminem cover is not as interesting as I figured it would be. In fact, it was quite dull. Basically, this is not a CD you listen to in the car. This is a background CD for when you are sick or in the bathtub or really don't feel like grooving."
2,What happened to the piano?,"I've been a fan of Tori since I heard ""Crucify"" when I was in the 6th grade. I own all of her CDs...I've even listened to LE to the point where it was scratched beyond all recognition, and it wouldn't play anymore. I thought I'd be a Tori fan for life.Then, I heard this album.I'm sick of the weird synths, and the strange echos in her music. I want Tori back at the piano, where she made the best music. This album made me want to cry."
2,Tori's Downward Spiral,"I've been a big Tori Amos fan for 10 years and am sorry to say that this latest effort is quite possibly her worst. Although great in concept, the final product pales in comparison to her early efforts. The album has a distinctively dark mood, but that's not the reason for my lack of interest; Tori's interpretation of these songs lack the power of the originals. Her ""breathy"" vocals give each a forbiding spin and a new ""twist"" on the meaning of the lyrics, but a little of that goes a long way. Although it has been apparent for quite sometime that Tori has been heading in this darker direction, I still miss the young woman that gave us ""Silent All These Years"", ""Winter"" and ""Corn Flake Girl"". Tori, go toward the light!"
2,Not real interesting....,"This isn't a real interesting Tori Amos album. The idea for the collection is a good one and Tori has done some great cover songs in her time, but most were b-side tracks. These songs may have worked better as b-side songs to a stronger collection of Amos's own work. If you're a die-hard fan, you'll want this album just for the sake of having it, but if you're looking to sample Tori's music for the first time, or you're new to her, start with some of her previous works. She's done some great work of her own. I give it two stars solely because it's Tori Amos behind this collection of songs."
2,Not a CD for all Tori fans,"I've been a loyal Tori fan since ""Little Earthquakes"", but I'm afraid this is the last Tori album that I will buy without hearing all of it first. I had great expectations of this album, as Tori's covers are frequently compelling and fun (and I have several collections of covers she's performed in concert), but there are only two tracks I like on this disc, and none that I love. Overall, I have enjoyed each new Tori album less than the one before. One problem with success is that famous writers stop being edited and popular artists start producing themselves. The result is often self-indulgent, and I feel this has happened to Tori. I don't begrudge her room to grow and change, but I can't help but feel an objective producer would have produced a better album. Perhaps her direction and my tastes are drifting further and further apart, but I don't think this album achieved its potential."
1,Uncompelling,"This is the first Tori CD that I just can't get excited about. The ""pained"" singing mentioned in another review comes across as very flat and dry to me. As a fan of some of the original versions of the songs on this CD, I am just not happy. Enjoy the silence is so slow and flat it sounds like she is on Valium rather than capturing the original essence of the Depeche Mode song. All in all, much of the CD reminds me of someone on heavy sedatives.The one song that that is done well, '97 Bonnie & Clyde, is just too emotionally painful to listen to.I wish she would quit trying different styles and stick with what drew me to her in the first place. Primarily Tori and Piano on songs on ""Under the Pink"" or covers like ""Smells like Teen Spirit"" or ""Angie"".Right now, Tori reminds of U2 after Joshua Tree before they got back to making good music. Hopefully she follows the same pattern and returns to her roots."
4,Quite Something...,"Now, admit it, with an idea like this, how can you expect a lot out of it? But man, Tori pulls it off. Tori (what I like to call) ""reimagines"" songs from artists like Eminem, The Beatles and Tom Waits and puts it into a female perspective perfectly. I honestly could not ask for a better CD for the theme. ""'97 Bonnie & Clyde"" is truely haunting. It's one of those songs you have to listen to again and again to get all of it. ""Strange Little Girl"" and ""New Age"" are also good songs. I strongly recommend this CD for music fans and Tori fans who are looking for something different to listen to. This CD is great...go buy it."
2,sigh.,"I adore Tori - but I could not get into this album. Although I don't doubt the depth in this piece, all but perhaps two of the songs are bland, sounded un-inspired, and are simply boring. I give two stars for the concept and for 'Raining Blood', but that is about it...if you want an introduction to Tori, look into any of her other albums, particulary her first three - Little Earthquakes, Under the Pink, and Boys for Pele. They are the masterpieces."
2,Dull,"Don't get me wrong. I'm a huge Tori Amos fan -- and that may be the problem. Her clever but disjointed lyrics are missing on this album, as is the sly familiarity she normally sings her boys and girls with.With the exception of ""Time"" (a Tom Waits tune), none of the songs on this album called to me. They bored me. The originals, I felt, were fine -- she didn't bring anything to them other than a gimmick. Yes, it was amusing listening to her sing the Eminem song -- but it wasn't something I'd play over and over. Not because of the material, but because it just wasn't *interesting*.And that's confusing, because Tori HAS done covers I like (Joni Mitchell's ""Case of You"" being one that immediately comes to mind). So is it me, or is it the album? If you are a diehard Tori fan, you probably already own this album. If you've never heard of her, you might like this album. And if you're in the middle (like me), you'll probably toss it in the pile with the rest of the discards, shrug, and move on."
3,"Early Tori sounds, minus early Tori words...","The only reason I gave this CD three stars is because I adore Tori and everything she does, and because I also love her old sound with just her and the piano, which this album mostly is. I was heavily disappointed with her decision to do solely covers on this, though. I love the Tori who writes beautiful and stragne songs herself. And I think that's what most people wanted. This album is worth the money, as is everything she does, just don't expect to be lulled by her lyrics. I am awaiting her next album although I'm sure it will be quite some time."
3,Didn't Live Up the the Hype,"I bought a copy of ""Atuk"" and read it through after reading some of these glowing reviews here on Amazon.It was an easy read, but the book suffered from shallow character development and cheap humor devices; plus it comes off as very dated.The story is amusing enough, there are a few laughs ""caribou sandwich with the blubber on the side"" -- in fact there is a wealth of Eskimo humor here.What is shocking is that one reviewer claims to reread this book again and again -- for me, once was PLENTY."
1,Visual Communication: Images with Messages,I'll be very short because my irritation is with not even being able to review the book in the first place to see if I want to even purchase it for that price. Too bad for the author/publisher because I tend to skip over buying those books and move on to those I can take a glimps into.Visual Communication: Images with Messages (with InfoTrac)
5,AWESOME !!!!!,This guy rocks he's a great guitar player and has an excellent band behind him. I suggest you get some if your seriously into the Blues like I am !!!!!!
1,A poor effort from Bruce,"Bruce Willis is a talented actor, but as a singer he is not up to task. There are other singer/actors who have made the transition successfully. Jennifer Love Hewitt and Jennifer Lopez come to mind. As a mild fan of this type of music, I was turned off by Bruce's attitude, which seems to focus more on his ego than on the music. THe band is entertaining, and the prospect exists for a good album by someone with a better voice. I cannot help but think the reason this album is so popular has to do with Bruce's stardom, not his potential to be the next Otis Redding, Sam Cook, or Micheal Bolton."
1,so bad it hurts,"Bruce is a decent actor, but as a singer, he can't cut it. I laughed when I listened to some of these cuts. If this were a comedy album, it would be good."
2,Better Than I Expected,"Is this a vanity album? Well, yes, that being said this album is not as bad as I expected. Willis is a passable singer, the only song he really butchers is `Secret Agent Man' and if you doubt, check out how horrible `Respect Yourself' sounds when someone else is doing the vocals. Of Course his choice of material could be better. He isn't really working with the rock idiom; of course, this is really a swing album. The best tracks are `Comin Right Up' and `Under The Boardwalk'."
1,who told him he could sing?,"really, does everyone who has a tv show or does a movie deserve a record contract? talent should speak for itself, unfortuatly, on this weak collection of songs, Willias squeeks and irritates more than delivers."
1,"don't go into the light, Carrol Anne!","don't waste your money on this cd. There is so much music that is out there that is great blues, jazz, and R & B, I can't believe all the ink that is being spilled over this pretender to the throne. Bruce will never be the King of Rock 'n Roll, but I know who gets my vote for court jester. A terrible cd all around. Bruce needs singing lessions"
1,so bad it hurts,"i love music, everything from madonna to boy george, but this is silly. bruce can't sing any more than william shatner on those comercials...they should do a duet. bruce can't sing, i don't know what else to say. the music here, i grew up with...and i was surprised to see the temtations lend their talents to this wasted project. there are better things out there to listen to than this."
1,one of the worst ever,"Bruce's worst track is the ""Bruno Bop"". How can he tell me to ""respect yourself"" when no decent musician would play with him in the first place. Bruce's selection of music is very questionable and you have to wonder what he was thinking. I don't like his ""harp"" playing, and think he should stick to acting. Bruce's recording carreer was a one night stand and he was ""moonlighting"" from his tv show to do this. Dispite the best efforts of everyone involved, if the lead singer can't get the job done...it doesn't matter what else is going on."
2,Cover not long enough,"I like the cover, it looks fine. The only issue I have is that it is not long enough to cover the distance from the lamp itself to the night table. I would suggest to anyone that considers buying this to get an extra one."
5,Cat watering system,"This reservoir is nice for the watering system I purchased for my two cats. When I go away for a couple days, I do not have to worry about stale water or water running out before I return. My one cat likes to drink from the faucet which I don't like and this watering system has a faucet like water fall and it suffices for the sink faucet. This reservoir is only part of the system I purchased, it has another part which contains the pump and main watering system."
2,drink well reserve tank,"I thought it would be a great idea to add a reserve tank to my drink well fountain, however the tank releases all of the water at once and if there is too much water in it, the fountain overflows."
5,dylan goes electric,"fabulous- I had only seen footage once on PBS, and there is more which I guess someone else hasPaul Butterfield is there as he is sitting on the side in one scene, and the original video I saw had him playing with Dylanwell worth getting as it marks a milestone, and liking both Dylan and Butterfield- it is greatNow if only someone has some Butterfield on video"
5,Landmark!,Murray Lerner's seamless editing of the metamorphisis of Bob Dylan is a fine example of documenttary filmmaking at it's best.
4,Roy's swan song...,"Two of the stars on this album are not with us anymore:Roy,the genius,and Stan Szelest,his keyboard player.In many ways,this is a culmination of Buchanan's career,featuring four instrumentals,and a number of guest vocalists,such as:Kanika Kress and John Sayles.The style is exactly what we have become accustomed to expect from this guitar wiz(who also sings):lots of soul and scorching guitar that will leave your rock rolling.Roy Buchanan the master,gone but not forgotten..."
5,IF YOU LIKE THIS GET THEM ALL.,"I love British Isles folk music and always liked the bits of American traditional music I heard via Pete Seeger, Bruce, films, etc. By chance, saw a link to this band whilst buying something on Amazon and what a great discovery. I've now bought all their stuff (I think) and they're all equally great.Real, authentic music, I think all would love if exposed to it properly."
3,it's pretty good,"Very good musically and very accurate to the period. Kind of hard to listen to the songs though in light of the times, that's all."
3,Can't hear the guitar,"Benson's playing may be in top form, but the recording of it definitely isn't. The keyboards sound great, and so do the drums and the bass player, but you can hardly hear the guitar. George sounds like he is playing way off in a corner somewhere. It's like they only gave him one microphone, and its on his voice, not his guitar. Not good."
4,"its a generator , what title do you need ? knight ? duke ?","works well ,starts easy , change oil often if you want it to last ,, if you run a/c it will power a small unit ok with smart power off , but you would be better off with the 3000"
5,"Handy packs of Neosporin, but probably the most expensive way to buy Neosporin",For at home is probably best to have a tube. But these can be really handy to carry on trips to have a few doses of Neosporin. Also good in a first aid kit!
4,Song For Nobody,I found this book to be a rare glimpse of Thomas Merton and how he valued his friendhips and shared his spiritual insights. His long time friendship with Robert Lax appeared to be two like minds sharing the same thoughts while in this book it was a kind of student mentor relationship which I enjoyed very much. Anyone who values Merton's writings would love to have this book in thier Merton collection.
2,Forgive the author.,"I suppose the people who produced this book started out on the reasonable-enough assumption that people who create visually interesting images and objects would also live in visually interesting surroundings. (The extra star is for their presumably good intentions.)So it must have been disconcerting for them to have gone to the trouble and expense of photographing all these artists' homes and coming up with one dirty, disorganized slobs' nest after another.Most of these homes look as if bears live there . . . clinically depressed, hygienically-challenged bears who never throw anything away and don't own any brooms or vacuum cleaners.If you're sufficiently interesting in decor that you're hoping to tease some decorating inspiration from this book, odds are that your own home is already vastly better-looking than these dumps."
1,True Bohemians,"My Czech ancestry would be very disconcerted that throughout this entire book...the beginnings - roots of bohemianism was not even mentioned! What about the beautiful bohemian glass artisans of Bohemia...century's BEFORE the Victorian Era.I know true Bohemians whose households do not look chaotic, but actually are eclectic - ethnic - mixtures of faux finishes that flow beautifully throughout.If you want bohemian style...do research at the library!"
2,This is Bohemian?,"This book is more a history of Bohemian style than anything else. The photos are uninspiring, dated and not at all what I considered ""Bohemian"" to be. It was a total disappointment. It IS hard to find books that show you how to decorate in an eclectic, ethnic and Bohemian style which is what I was lookin for. In the end I've decided to add ALL ethnicities to my bedroom: Morrocan lamp, Mexican wrought-iron candelabra, Thai carved wood platform bed, rattan headboard, leopard skin chair, carved red Chinese armoire, and Indian-style entertainment cabinet! Now that's what I'd call Bohemian!"

5,Foreword by the Editors,""".... Although it is hoped that even the expert will find in its chapters information of interest and value, it was for the average sportsman, beginner or veteran, that this book was prepared.In it there is the rich fruit of the experience of many men who have devoted their years to fishing and hunting and life outdoors, ashore and afloat. Because of the immensely wide scope of the book, occasionally it has been necessary to cover in a few paragraphs subjects on which whole books---good and interesting books, too---have been written. But when the limitations of space have made such brevity unescapable, care has been taken to include all of the essential information about the subject under consideration. That the sportsman reader will find this the most complete and the most generally useful book on the outdoors that ever has been published is our hope.""[from foreword by the editors]"
3,"Pay attention, it is only 1 episode","My kids love Scooby and Batman, so like most people, I agreed, it was a no brainer. I bought my copy in a store and didn't pay attention to the small print that said ONLY 1 EPISODE! There are 2 DVDs out there with identical boxes. The only difference is the writing that says contains 1 episode. I have no idea why they bothered to put this disk out. The other Scooby and Batman disk has 3 or 4 episodes. So pay attention when you're buying your disk.That said, this is a classic and typical Scooby disk. It's the old style so you know it won't be too scary for the younger ones. My twin 4 years old and my 7 year old love the disk. If you like classic Scooby Doo, you won't be disappointed by this disk. I gave it only 3 stars simply for the 1 episode issue. I'll probably end up buying the full disk since my kids keep reminding me how silly I was to buy a disk with only 1 episode on it. Silly mommy."
5,Still Watching it,My boys have had this movie for awhile and still watch it. We even gave this as a gift to my nephew.
2,Certainly not my favorite,"I am a big fan of Scooby-Doo and also the Batman T.V. show. This movie only captures the spirit of both shows in the first episode. The second is just plain Boring. However, I appreciate the retro feeling of both shows being portrayed on this DVD. The features aren't much to speak of, so overall there is little to be said on whether this film is worth the money you pay for it or if you should just wait and record it off of Cartoon Network."
3,Recommended Title,"Interesting read although mainly focusing on things to do when 'down south'.I was hoping more for a guide broken down by country and their rimming preferences, kinda light on pictures and diagrams but all the same an interesting read when heading down to the 'back end'of beyond."
4,I was very impressed with this book,I'm not too familar with Usborne books because I only have three usborne books. I purchased this book at a homeschool convention. It was marked down in price. I was and am still very impressed at the amount of information it contains. Admittedly it is for older kids probably more for Jr high and high school. I might try a study of it when my son is in 6th but I'll have to see. I have read quite a bit of it myself and it seems very thorough.
5,Keran love it!!!,The Lorax is a good book I though it sould get a award.It givesyou a lesson about life!Its not that kind of book that you think its funny.It is a wonderful book to read on your summer break!I read it 100 TIMES!So read it!
4,Book Review of The Lorax,The Lorax by Dr. Seuss was an interesting and entertaining read. It is a great example Seuss's typical writing. It is obviously meant for children but is entertaining for all ages. It carries a somewhat of an environmentalist message and in that respect seems somewhat political but is still a very good story due to its well-developed plot and its skillfully done rhyme scheme. Many aspects of it are very humorous especially in the naming of characters and in the names of various places and things mentioned in the story. This element makes it a perfect book for young children as it keeps them interested in the story at hand.
3,Meh,"This is one of Dr. Seuss's more moralizing books.Here's the funny thing. I like Dr. Seuss. I agree with the points he makes in most of his preachier books - The Lorax, The Butter Battle Book, The Sneetches, Yertle the Turtle. The message in this book (seriously, cutting down beautiful woodland for junk is a foolish idea) is a good and timely one.And yet... I don't like the book that much. I think it's a little heavy-handed, and while I understand *why* it is heavy-handed (and maybe it needs to be), it just plain irritates me.I took off half a star for that. I do have a copy of it, but it's for private reading, not reading aloud."
5,TIME TO SAY 'PLEASE'!,"Perfect for the attention span of the little ones with enough substance for the over fives. With Mo Willems there is a ""little"" something on the pages for future reads. This one has a cute game inside the jacket."
5,All kinds of Crazy,Well lets see i have had this Album in my colection for eight years now and i still listen to it from start to end no track jumping here. I cant say enough to convence you that this album/cd is well worth the price. Every element of the band is fireing on all cylenders and not running out of fuel any time soon. And if you take my advice and pick up any little charlie you can get your hands on toyou cant go wrong. e-mail me and tell me what you think blgdaddykool@hotmail one more thing if they every cruse thru town dont miss them.
5,If not buy - rent... you will not be sorry.,"I may not be as eloquent as those who have reviewed this movie already, however I will say this to those of you who have not seen this movie... ""What are you waiting for ! "" If I could turn back the hands of time to watch this again for the first time I would.The most I will say about this movie is that I feel that it was an honor to be able to view such a movie. I thank God that I can hear, see, and feel this movie. I will be tightening the belt next payday so that I may purchase this wonderful masterpiece. I am not one to watch who directs something, or who produces something, or even who writes something, however I would like to thank these three men for creating such a wonderful movie."
5,Spellbinding from beginning to end,"Based upon a Stephen King book, this movie tells the story of Louisiana prisoner, seven foot John Coffey. Coffey's mystical powers, his wrongful execution, and the ensuing strange happenings create a movie that's spellbinding from beginning to end."
5,In Praise of a Featured Veteran,"Having not read all of the previous reviews of this excellent King adaptation, I must add to the accolades by singling out one of the film's supporting performers, one who has been a presence for over a half century: Dabbs Greer. Although only seen as the ""old Paul Edgecomb,"" Greer makes a memorable turn as the elder version of Tom Hanks in the movie's closing moments. His quiet and dignified soliloquy is truly touching. I cannot tell how moved I was by such a topper to this outstanding bit of storytelling. Greer, as well as all parties involved, magnificently brought one of Stephen King's best works to the screen. Along with ""The Shawshank Redemption,"" ""Mile"" ranks as the most faithful and cinematically satisfying of any jump from page to the cinema."
1,skip it...,This movie really really sucks... Don't waste your time!!! Nothing like Dead Man Walking.
2,Too heavy-handed,"Well made film and I would have probably liked it more if it hadn't been so heavy-handed. The inexorably evil prison guard and the epilogue offended my intelligence so much that it clouded everything else in the movie. I can see why it's a hit with the audience though. I can see how it renews the faith of many, especially during this era in which it has become hip to be ironic and cynical. Of course, ""Magnolia"" also deals with faith and grace and divine intervention but it did not come anywhere near ""The Green Mile"" in terms of box-office receipts, which goes to show that people still like their spiritual messages simplified, and sugar-coated."
4,"Not Shawshank, but still Excellent","A very, very good movie, you will not even realize how the time passes by."
4,no real issues,It took longer than it should have to arrive. Other than that I have no real issues. Great movie and great price.
2,Overlong prison drama-fantasy shines in spots,Both Michael Jeter and Michael Duncan give stellar supporting performances as death row prisoners during the Depression in this odd mixture of drama and fantasy - the latter was deservedly Oscar nominated for his performance as the man with miraculous powers. At three hours this is a vastly and needlessly overlong film and Hanks is wasted in the lead. It was surprisingly nominated for Best Film (not deserving) and Screenplay as well as the nod to Duncan. It is a very odd and unconvincing film with some very nauseating scenes of realistic electrocution deaths (why God made the fast forward button)- be warned. A true oddity.
1,Very Sick,A depressing and weird movie that lasted for 3 LONG hours. Not for anyone under the age of 16.
2,Give me a break!,"Dull, corny, sappy, predictable .... Where have you ever seen such lovely death row inmates before! Don't kill him - he's just a mass murderer and he has a pet mouse! Hah! And what's with all the urine in this film ... some kind of weird fixation going on."
3,Somewhat pleased,"I was kinda disappointed in this product. I loved the movie but several times during the movie, the movie would suddently stop as if it was scratched then it would start back playing. This happened at least 4 times. I would go back to the previous scene just to see if it would play through but it would stop again. I took the cd out to make sure that there were no scrathces and there was no visible sign of scratches."
4,The Oscar Mile: American Beauty wins by a nose,"A very, very good film. Although it did not match up to Shawshank, it had its own good stuff. About a miracle man up for execution, you guessed it, he didnt do it. Tom Hanks and David Morse do a great job. Tom Hanks now does all kinds of things that are not comedy. This would have won best picture easily, but one problem. Too many other good ones to choose from! I have never seen American Beauty, but I expect that it must be pretty ******* good to beat this, The Sixth Sense, and whatever else there was. See this, you wont soon forget."
1,Astonishingly Awful!!,"A 3 hour movie revolving around a pseudo-Christ-figure with a death wish -- ""I'm tired boss, put me out of my misery; it would be a kindness you'd be doing.""A character who says, ""He killed them with their love for each other."" OK, I'm sure that pertains to Percy and Wild Bill as well.This movie is way too long (perhaps in hopes of winning some Oscars), it really doesn't make sense (as one reviewer noted, you'll need to be over 30 to understand this, though), featured characters that are simplistic (Snoopy and Garfield are more complex and better drawn characters than any in this movie), and will only appeal to people who are starved for kindness and want their sentimentality served up big in warm, sugary heapin' helpings.Oh, if for some reason you liked this movie, then you might also want to try Magnolia -- another ""gem""! (Watch 'em both for a combined 6 hrs of drivel :)"
1,Says Disc two on Disc but it was the same as Disc one:-(,This is my favorite movie and I was so disappointed that disc two was the same as disc one only the cover was labeled as disc two
3,Essentially a TV movie - a very good one,"One feels like a thug quibbling with such a well-intended, moral film, but when all is said is done, THE GREEN MILE is a TV movie ladled with lots of money. One can sniff a three year old (or Stephen King) phoning in the plot turns, the music is over the top, and the running time would tax Methusulah. Nevertheless, the performances are sterling (the sadistic guard is great), photography first-rate, and its heart is in the right place. But for my money the Christ story is just too ripe, the symbology overt, and the mouse thing was arch. However, as general entertainment, it's a good offering."
5,A great film - well worth watching. Where are the awards?,"Truly, this film ought to have won a few awards. The performances, especially by Tom Hanks and David Morse are superb. They offer warm portrayals of caring prison guards working on death row during the depression. It's a welcome departure from the stereotypical characterization of prison guards as ruthless, evil people.The film was perhaps a bit longer than it needed to be, but it is nevertheless enjoyable.Cinematically, I didn't care for the flies (or whatever they were supposed to be) coming out of John Coffey's mouth, but it will be hard to find a viewer who won't be moved by this tale."
3,Very touching movie,"First of all, I thought everyone gave an outstanding performance -- Especially Michael Clarke (Duncan) and Tom (Hanks). Their performances were the most moving in my opinion. I was REALLY amazed by John's (Michael Clarke Duncan) faith healing power. The only thing I was scared of was some of the violence -- Especially Percy's (Doug Hutchison) violent ways. Other than that, I enjoyed the movie. In conclusion, THE GREEN MILE was a very touching movie. If you haven't seen it, go out there, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it."
5,THE BOOK TO MOVIE,"I thought that even though they did not follow the book exactly they did an excellent job on the movie. I had read the book first and was sure they would ruin the movie but they didn't it was excellent. I try not to read the book first because it always means the movie [stinks]. I.E. (Silence of the Lambs, The Shining, The Sphere) all great books and awful movies."
5,A Return To Glory,"With this CD, the Caddies are back on top of their game. I'm a big fan of all their CD's, but after Rock the Plank, I was afraid that like many other ska bands, they were giving up the horns and going punk. Not so. This CD brings back many of the awesome, blaring horns that defined Duck and Cover. There are still some hornless songs, but I don't really care, since those rock too. These dudes mix in so many different styles and do it so well. That whole Dixieland ska sound may seem weird to some, but I think it fits in really nicely. The best songs on this CD are Riot, Last Breath, Just One More, Leavin', Wet Dog, and 10 West. Buy it now, you won't be sorry. Long live the Caddies."
5,essental reggea,"As is most often the case, the prof. critics are wrong and the people are right. Alpha Blondy is essental to anyone who wants to understand reggea, both musically and politically. 5+++ stars."
3,Took almost a year!,"It is nice to have faith in times like this...this little book will give you hope on selling your home.It took us over a year to sell, any positve encouragement helps."
2,Not the greatest,"I've had this tv for about 3 years. I agree with the other comment that you need to replace the bulbs. It happens frequently - every 9 months to 1 year or even sooner with cheap bulbs (3 months). JVC made replacement lamps can be pricey (currently $199 plus s/h) on top of the cost of the tv itself. Not to mention the screen resolution is pretty dark - not bright and colorful. We are unable to watch any movie that has dark backgrounds.Just letting you know our experience - we still have the tv, but are saving to get another tv as quick as possible."
4,Mid '80s fun,"The film may well have been fair-to-middling but the soundtrack is a cut above, considering.The easy listening pop tunes are fine but have dated in a far less interesting way than the more adventurous cuts whose highlights are undoubtedly the electro and rap tunes by the Willesden Dodgers, Whodini and Mark Shreeve. Sure, these numbers have dated as well but they represent an excellent snapshot of that particular type of electronic music from the mid '80s and are well worth the (modest, if you shop around) price of admission.A special mention should go to Jack Nitsche's mostly successful effort at evoking early '80s Tangerine Dream on the album's final track."
1,Great Songs but released in MONO,That's right this disk is in MONO with the exception of just two songs. These were recorded in the mid 1960's when stereo was in full swing. I know for a fact that Winchester Cathedral was recorded is stereo because I have it in stereo from a compilation CD of various artists that I bought in the past. It does bother me that these companies release these in a half hazard way.
4,Excellent if you like this kind of music.,"Winchester Cathedral, of course, needs no recommendation. It is one of the greatest musical pieces of all time. As for the rest of the record, I like it, but I would understand it if others don't like it as much as I do.Better preview all the tracks before you buy.Fungus"
4,Drinkwell cat fountain,"I have 1 & have given 2 as gifts. Love 'em. Some are more noisy than others. This unit is louder than the older model I have. Just wish is was a different material, the resin allows for hard water build up & sometimes takes a lot of scraping to get clean. For finiky cats it's GREAT & it saves me from cleaning cat hair from the sink & leaving the water faucet on for the cats!"
3,2 outta 3 aint bad,"It works fine, hasn't gotten gunked up for me yet. But I still have one stubborn cat that only drinks from the fish tank. What is his problem? I've had dozens of cats in my day, and never one with this drinking issue. So I guess the aquarium lid stays off for now..."
2,Leaks,My cat wants water from a faucet so I was excited over this. He likes it. Problem is it leakes really bad. I used it for a week stopped. Tired of wet floor
1,I FINALLY GIVE UP,"I had a Drinkwell for my cats that lasted 3 years before the motor died. That's pretty good so I have no complaints. Then I bought another. Worked beautifully for 1 day and then began making a noise, kinda like something was loose inside. Was so loud that I could hear it in every room of my apartment. Could not return it because of where I got it (good price, no returns) so I figured I had a 'lemon' and should try again. Went on Amazon and saw an amazingly good price. So I bought it. I also perused the reviews and saw about a 50-50 split on the annoying noise (a rattling which drowns out the 'gentle hum'). Just got it. Plugged it in last night and was delighted that it was QUIET. Until 4am when I was awakened by a buzzing-rattling-something-is-loose-inside-here sound, just like the last one. I give up. The product is badly made. Fortunately the noise doesn't bother my cats, so I will unplug it when I go to sleep. Will never ever buy another."
3,"Worked, but the cats were afraid of it!","I have three cats, and they have never been the kind who want to drink from a dripping faucet. However, I hoped that they would like this fountain as it would deliver freshly filtered water to them. They were mostly frightened of the noise it made . . . slight motor noise and the noise of the water falling. They did drink from it, but preferred their old gravity feed water bowl. So back it went."
3,Torture on my fingers!,First let me say that the product does work well and my two cats and one dog now refuse to drink from a bowl. With that said the product must be taken apart to be cleaned and removing the pump is no easy task. I have tried for 30 minutes and and only accomplished broken nails and bleeding fingers. I finally had to hand the thing to my husband. He was able to remove it but not easily. I am looking for a fountain that is easier to clean.
2,Noise!,This product was so noisy I could hear it all over the house and the cats were terrified of it.
3,almost killed my chihuahua,"I loved the fountain @ first. I had already been through 2 petmate fountains, which all broke. I have 2 chi's & 1 cat. I came home one day to find something wrong w/ my littlest chi. I was so concerned that I brought her to the vet, who could find nothing wrong w/ her. I later discovered why she was acting so strangly. She had chewed through the pet fountains electrical wire. I took great care to make sure that it was as out of reach as possible, but she got to it anyway. So, not only was my fountain dead, but I'm lucky that one of my dogs is not also dead. It was at least a week before she began acting normal again. I don't know what I would have done if I had returned to find her dead! Be VERY careful w/ dogs!"
3,ONLY Lasted 6 months,"My cats loved it when it worked, but it broke after ~6 months. Now its just a fancy water bowl and it doesn't cycle the water, so my cats are less interested in it. It was also louder than I thought. I am contacting them to see if they will send a replacement, but they probably won't."
3,Probably not worth it,"I bought this for my cat because (1) he likes to drink out of water taps and I thought he'd like it; (2) I travel a lot and when I leave a bowl of standing water for him it is full of cat fur by the time I get home. The fur problem wasn't really solved with this, because the fur is still deposited in the water bowl and proceeds to clog the water in-take. Also, he doesn't seem to like the noise and only reluctantly sneaks over to the corner to drink out of it."
2,Made in China,"I purchased the Drinkwell Original Pet Fountain from Amazon.com and upon opening the package learned that the product was Made in China. Because of my concerns about toxins in many Chinese products, I telephoned customer service of the manufacturer to find out more information. The representative could not give me answers to satisfy my concerns so this product is going back. Why can't products be made in the U.S.??? I would gladly pay more--"
3,Cats never use it.,"We bought this to encourage our cat to drink because of his urinary problems. The cat never used it. We have a new cat. He does not use it. He prefers drinking out of the dog water or the toilet, which we discourage. A visitor cat who enjoys drinking out of faucets also doesn't use it. I wonder, even if it has a filter, if the water still gets stale. I am not inclined to taste it, however.Otherwise it works well, fills easily, and is relatively silent. After 3 months I have turned it off. Perhaps I will try again with another cat."
4,Easy to work - cats are alright with it,The product is really easy to take apart/put together. It is not that good looking. Cats like it alright. You have to keep the water pretty high or the fountain becomes loud. You have to clean really well weekly or it gets incredibly slimy.
3,Drinkwell Fountain,"Had another Drinkwell for years with the extra bottle, so new companions, new fountain! Works well HOWEVER the pump seems noisier than the last one we owned."
1,really noisy,"I had a petmate fountain that cracked and was looking for a replacement. This looked and sounded good. I read the reviews and thought ""how noisy could a cat fountain be?"". I expected a hum to the motor. Then I plugged it in and realized that the motor is insanely loud. It's not a hum. The cat is terrified of it and I can't say that I blame him. Luckily, he's pretty good about drinking water so I am going to try to ""make it work"" by running the motor and circulating the water primarily when he's outside. However, I'm sure I'll end up buying another one before too long, and I'll buy the petmate one I had before. It was impossible to clean but it was quiet."
1,Fountian,"This fountian is great and we liked it but after using it only a few days we realized it leaks on the floor, seems to leaking underneath around the pump area."
2,Good chocice if it does not leak,"I had this product for past seven years. Was quite satisfied, as my pets like it. It was running since then, until two weeks back the motor got burnt out, as i left with ignorant hands. Nevermind, immediately I order new one from Amazon,got in two days. Set it up and it was good, until the next early morning, when the motor was being too noisy. There was a huge water leakage. Felt bad, but i ordered another one, just assuming this could be one defective piece. The second order came in about two days, and that also leaked. Was mad now, as had to return defective items. I believe the product is good, but the company who is selling at present is missing quality check on it."
2,Noisy Fountain,"Though it works fine, keeping filtered water running for the pets, the motor is quite loud and I often unplug it because it's so annoying."
3,"Good, but... not so good for hard water areas","I have had 2 Drinkwell pet fountains. We have 4 cats, and 2 of them use the fountain. (The other 2 cats prefer to drink from a bowl of standing water.) We live in the desert southwest and have fairly hard water. The Drinkwell pet fountain is very difficult to clean and requires frequent cleaning. I tried cleaning with white vinegar and dish soap, but I cannot remove the hard water stains that basically become part of the plastic. The hard water stains build up over time and it is impossible to keep it clean after 2-3 years. I just threw away the last fountain because I could not remove the black mold that had adhered to the hard water stains. I'm planning to get a ceramic fountain because they are supposed to be easier to clean.If you are diligent about keeping the pet fountain cleaned every week or so, then it will last a long time. But, if you live in a hard water area, then the pet fountain will not last more than 2-3 years."
1,"No, don't buy it!","After two weeks our family has had it with this fountain! It is noisy to the point that no one, not even the cats, wants to be in the kitchen with it. Don't waste your money!"
2,review,"I bought this and it leaks like crazy, cats love drinking from it, but all it does is leak. that really needs to be addressed. why make a water fountain that leaks?"
2,I don't know what's worse....,"I have a cat who would rather die of dehydration than drink out of an ordinary bowl...she is such a princess!! I bought this item from a local pet store and it was WAY more expensive than on Amazon (about $20 more), I wish I had looked here first even though I don't think it's worth the $30 they are charging. I have to say that the fountain is incredibly noisy, whether it is full or not and it is about as equivilant to my cat crying for water from the faucet. Also, if it isn't cleaned every week or so it gets so clogged with gunk that it won't even run and cleaning it is no easy feat. You have to take the whole darn thing apart and the electrical chord isn't detachable. I think the filter is just really a ploy to get you to spend more money becuase it doesn't last more than two weeks even with regular cleaning. My cat loves it though and it is the only product that she will actually use, so it's just one hassle trade off for another."
2,"Easy to use, but noisy","This product works well and as advertised, and my cat likes it OK - but it's so noisy that I have decided to return it.Easy to set up. Easy to fill and operate - just plug it in after installing the filter and filling with water. Well designed (except for the noisy pump/motor).But it makes a constant, rattling buzzing sound which can be heard throughout the living area of my apartment. I thought a part might be loose on it, or it might have been cracked in shipment, but no. Then, I thought maybe I could get used to the noise. No good, so its going back."
2,Impossible to reassemble after cleaniing,"My cats loved this fountain for a couple of weeks. Then I had the arduous task of taking it apart, cleaning and then putting back together. The taking apart and cleaning were easy. The directions in the accompanying booklet are horrible and were no help. Got it together on my own, then water leaked on the floor. Put back together and now the knob control does not work and it still leaks. I have contacted the manufacturer and will let you know what response I get. I hope I didn't just flush the price of this unit down the toilet"
2,Too loud,"I bought this based on great product reviews and the fact that everyone stated that it did not make any noise. Totally incorrect....the motor was so loud I could hear it in our guest bedroom with the door shut and the TV on. Plus, if you don't pay attention to how much water you put in, it will overflow in the back. So I returned it for the Pioneer Pet Stainless Steel Fountain Raindrop Design."
4,good product,"This definitely beats the alternative, but I have some gripes about it. The unit clogs easily, it needs frequent cleaning, and is a pain to clean. Having one of these is incredibly convenient though, so if it were any less I would give it 3 stars.I haven't tried other fountains so I'm unsure if others would be an improvement."
5,Great Product,I bought this as a replacement for my previous drinkwell fountain which lasted about 8 years with heavy use and abuse by multiple cats.
5,Well worth it,"I was hesitant about buying this fountain, because I have read reviews that it was loud. It arrived today, I filled it up, plugged it in, and haven't heard a thing. You can adjust the water flow (less flow near ""11 o'clock"" and more flow near ""1 o'clock""). With the flow at 11, it is closest to the trickling water from the faucet that my cat has always preferred (and there is absolutely no noise from the stream of water hitting the bowl).I also worried that my cat wouldn't like it, but he took one look at it and started drinking. No problems there.In all, I would say this purchase was well worth the money. It is quiet, convenient, and hopefully will encourage the cat to drink more."
4,Good investment if your cats prefer running water,"My cats haven't seemed to take a preference over this with the other water dispenser I have. I bought the fountain because they seemed to want to drink out of the faucet in my sink and I took that to mean that they were thirsty for running water. As we know, cats are finnicky, and mine just went back to drinking from the old water dispenser despite the fact that the fountain is right next to it. I don't know if they're uncertain what to make of it, or if they're just trying to annoy me. :) At any rate, it works well, isn't too noisy (imagine a fountain) and certainly seems to keep the water fresh. I bought the reservoir, too, since it seemed to run low on water every 3 days or so without it. Good product."
2,it's too small for three cats.,"the fountain itself is fine. good quality. it's a replacement for a larger model that sprang a leak after 2 years of continued service. alas, the only model fitting in my budget for misc. items was this one."
1,Too Loud,The motor was too loud that my cat got scared and wouldn't drink the water. It was frustrating.
3,"My cats would give this a ""5"". But they don't have to clean it - or replace it far too often","Pros:+ Cats obviously love it - often they play in the stream of water - and vets say they tend to drink more when it's a pleasurable experienceCons:- Cleaning is a pain. Literally. I have arthritis in my hands, so removing the motor is not only difficult but it actually hurts me. (my husband's hands are fine, but he's so annoyed with the cleaning process that he's flat-out refused to do it).- This is our second Drinkwell in less than 2 years. The first stopped running after we'd had it little over a year. (Sure, we could have bought a new motor, but Drinkwell's cust service only said it PROBABLY was a bad motor. We could bet $20 to find out). And now the second one is making a grinding sound."
1,"noisy, noisy, noisy","This fountain runs as loud as the refrigerator, even with a cloth pad under it to try to deaden the motor noise. One reviewer said he/she had wrapped bubble wrap around the motor... Luckily, instead of purchasing this item I borrowed it from a friend whose cats didn't use it enough to warrant the cleaning process and she had it sitting in a closet. As far as set up goes, the motor is difficult to push into the opening far enough to seat it properly. I have ordered the stainless steel Big Max by Pioneer because the reviews say the motor is virtually silent."
1,Noisy and stopped working in two days,The product does not work and when it is running it is extremely noisy not worth it still looking for an alternative
4,no more faucet sink,This fountain is great my cats have stopped drinking out of the toilet and faucet in the sink!! The only con is it is a pain to clean!!
5,Thanks,"Turns out my cat was very afraid of this water fountain, but my mother's cat can't get enough of the running water. Thanks so much."
5,Pleasant surprise,"I honestly expected a $35 novelty item. However, the Drinkwell is whisper quiet, effective, and simple to maintain. Our cats love it and are drinking noticeably more water as a result. The big ""con"" is that there really is no reservoir to speak of; we find that daily refills are necessary to keep up with evaporation and the cats' thirst. The add-on reservoir is a must if you want to go more than a couple of days without refilling."
1,Noisy,"I had to return this item, the vibration level is very audible. I tried shifting every position and putting things at the bottom to cushion but it was still annoyingly audible. I guess it will be good if it was placed in the kitchen to mask the noise with the other household noises. Whenever I turn it on, the vibration noise would make the cat run away and avoid it."
5,Dog Fountain,"We have the Big Dog fountain for our Boxer and Pointer, and they love it! Our cat loves it, too. My daughter's chihuahua loves to drink out of it when she visits. So, we have gotten her this smaller version for Christmas! They all love the taste of the water and howit flows out of the Drinkwell fountain."
2,Doesn't last,"Cats liked it, it was quiet, splash was minimal. Gave out after about six weeks and I had not let it clog or the water level go too low."
2,Absurdly difficult to clean,"My wife and I bought one of these for our three cats and while it did do everything that it claimed--they drank more and all that. But good grief what a pain to clean. It's one of those situations where you're convinced that the designer has never owned a cat and never used the product.I'm on the hunt for a replacement for ours and, while I don't know what I'm going to get, I know it won't be one of these.Note to manufacturers: Test your product before you release it!!!"
2,leaks,kind of pointless product if it leaks. they did design the product so why design it with such a flaw. had to fix it w glue. i wouldnt buy this again
3,"Cats love it, didn't last long","While it worked, the cats were all about it, but it only lasted a year or so. The motor blew and now it wont turn on."
3,"Only lasted several months, motor swelled","I bought this fountain with the hope that my cat, who ignored water dishes but loved the sink, would drink from it. She did really enjoy it. I had no real issues, but it was slightly difficult to clean. Several months after I bought it, the motor became swollen and more and more difficult to remove. I actually bent a knife attempting to take it out. In the process, the plastic broke and I cut myself on it. I have no idea why the motor swelled the way it did.I moved onto the Drinkwell Platinum and have had zero problems."
5,My puppy loves it!,This is just what I needed to make my puppy drink his water! He thinks it's like drinking from the hose. Lol. Thank u
4,title.,"cool incentive for a dogs and cats to drink more water! i know my dog consumes moar, but not to sure about the skiddish cats."
1,Didn't last..,This was a great waterer for the time it lasted (which was about 3 months). I have 2 cats that love to drink out of the faucet (fresh running water) so I figured the fountain would be a perfect fit for them. It was.. until it died. Cleaned it every 3-4 days.. and then one day.. nothing. I won't try it again!! $40 down the tubes..
1,Leaked all over the place,"Difficult to assemble, with poor instructions. No labels on parts diagrams, but it is expected that one knows the names of them. Many parts not shown in diagram.When I finally got it together, it leaked all over the place. I put it back in the box and returned it requesting a replacement. A couple of weeks later, still nothing.At the time I ordered this fountain, I also ordered extra filters to make the order large enough to qualify for free shipping. I sent the extra filters back at the same time I sent the leaky fountain back, and I immediately received a new package of filters along with an email saying ""your order is complete"". The filters are, obviously, useless without a working fountain. Now what about paying for shipping to replace them?A very unsatisfactory experience (so far)."
4,A very pleasent surprise,"He has done it again, with a very different style he captivates the listener. This promises to be a big hit and loved by anyone who is able to apreaciate good mexican rock. My favorite song is el chamuco and El no lo mato.QUE VIVA MEXICO Y EL ROCK!"
2,Crappy Pillow,"When this pillow arrived it was rolled up in travel mode. When I unrolled it it was completely flat and stayed that way for two days. I washed it to see what would happen and it plumped up beautifully. It looked like it was going to be a really great pillow at that point, at least until I rolled it up again. When I unrolled it on the trail for my first nights sleep it was flat again. I tried to plump it up with no avail. This would be a good pillow if it had batting inside instead of foam cubes. I will be replacing the cube foam with something else. The pillow is pretty much useless like it is."
4,Great little pillow,"We used this pillow when we went camping and once you have washed it and put it in the dryer it definitely fluffs up and is great. We would have given it 5 stars but once the pillow is all fluffed up you don't want to pack it down for transport which kind of defeats the purpose of it being compressible.All that said, it served its purpose well and we would recommend it to others."
3,Not as good as the first one,"I bought this and it is the second one. The first one was a medium size which more than meet my expectations. This one is just bigger, but appears to have the same amount of material as the smaller one. Its OK"
3,comfortable,"I found this very comfortable to sleep on. Some people complained about the lumpy factor and that didn't really bother me. Yes, you can feel that there are small pieces of foam and that's not one big piece of foam like a normal pillow, but when actually lying on it, it's not that noticeable or a big deal. Also, the more time it has to air out and expand, the better it is. This worked for my needs but I did find it impossible to squish it down as tightly as when I very first got it. I still prefer this to an inflatable pillow. I got the medium size which was comfortable but not very small when packing my carry-one. I did take it on a plane, but I think if you are looking for something for back-packing or frequent plane travel, you might consider the small size."
3,Not exactly what you'd expect,"This pillow is OK. The size and the fact that it rolls up are nice for traveling, but it's not very comfortable. When I first got it and unrolled it, it was as flat as a pancake. I thought I had been totally ripped off. But, instructions say to ""fluff"" it. Believe me, you will wear your arms out trying to fluff this thing up to full capacity. I could never get it to fully reach a good size. The microbeads just stayed in clumps at the center of the pillow while the edges hung limp. I would not recommend this product."
4,great buy,"I am quite happy with this pillow. As other reviews have said, once you wash it, it really puffs out. Its quite comfortable to sleep with, I got the medium size pillow and for me its just right. It rolls up relatively small and did not take too long to expand once I unpacked it (I washed it before I traveled). Bottom line- I am very pleased with my purchase and it was well worth it!"
2,What a Bummer!!,"Really Costello's only truly disappointing albums. Not much can be said about it that is good. Weak lyrics, and definitely not his best sounding music. Blame it mostly on the production. (Langer/Winstanley)"
2,A guilty pleasure or two,"It's commonly agreed that 'Goodbye' is not one of Costello's better efforts. I concur, but must confess enjoyment of two songs that are generally cursed by EC purists: 'I Wanna Be Loved' and 'Only Flame in Town'.While not lyrically compelling, I find the songs musically enjoyable. Love the strange synth feel to 'Wanna' and even the sax solo. The demo version of 'Only Flame' on EC's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is superior to the standard recording here. Costello originally seems to have conceived the song as a 50s style slow dance number. It's kitschy but fun!'The Comedians', also recorded by the late Roy Orbison, is about the only other cut of significant interest. Like 'Only Flame', the demo version of this song on Rhino's 'All This Useless Beauty' bonus disc is better than the one here."
2,Broke down after one use,"I bought this product based on the reviews and I'm afraid I have not had the same good experience. This is product is very poorly made. I bought it mostly to make ""sun dried"" tomatoes because my garden is overflowing with tomatoes. I just used about three shelves to start. I evenly spaced the tomatoes. These were not large tomatoes either and it took over 6 hours to dehydrate them - twice as long as the instructions stated. I had to turn it up to high to finally get them dried. So much for the ""world's fastest dehydrator."" The next week my husband decided to make beef jerky. When he tried to put the shelves back together, they no longer fit right. It seemed like the shelves had shrunk or were bent. In any case, they did not sit properly on the bottom unit. Right now I'm still trying to decide if it's worth the hassle of returning it."
1,Terrible product...beware!,"This thing is a pile of junk. It worked fine for a while, but then it just died. I used it no more than a handful of times. That's less than five times. Luckily for Nesco, it died precisely three weeks after its warranty expired. Pretty sad. I probably will never buy one of these again, and I didn't even get to try the fruit leather. :("
2,JUST STOPPED WORKING!!!,"I loved this dehydrator until it just stopped working the other night. We had only used it maybe 30 times, owned it just over 1 year, and the other night we put some meat in to make beef jerky, turned it on and 3 hours later it just stopped. Very disappointed."
4,Food Dehydrator,"We had one of these (same brand and size) for 20 years and just wore it out. I bought this particular model due to the same size racks so I can use the old ones without purchasing more. I would have rated 5 stars except there is a very slight difference in the racks so that they just don't quite line up for secure stacking. By carefully fitting together and placing and object beside the dehydrator so the racks don't shift, it works fine. Certainly the four racks that come with it fit great.I hope to get another 20 years of use from this product."
2,Okay but Not Great,The product arrived early which was nice. The product takes much longer to dehydrate fruit than the instructions indicate. The first thing I tried was banana chips - it took not 6-8 hours but about 30 hours to dry the chips - kiwi was the same -Another thing about the machine there is NO on/off switch. I have set the dehydrator in a back room and will just let it do its thing and wait for dried fruit.
5,NESCO FOOD DEHYDRATOR,GOOD BUY. HAVE NOT USE IT YET. PLAN TO USE IT IN THE FUTURE AND I KNOW IS GOOING TO BE OK
5,Unboxed it and made my first batch of bananas,I'm giving this unit 5 stars based on a one time use. I originally got the dehydrator to make healthy dog snacks. It arrived yesterday (great shipping time) and I had a good amount of bananas just sitting around so I decided to try it out. I filled up all 5 trays and it took about 8 hours. These are much better tasting than the store bought (which are fried). The noise level from the machine wasn't bad at all. You can hear the fan while in the kitchen but once I walked into another room I couldn't hear it at all. I will update once i've had a chance to use the machine more.
5,Works great!!!,I bought this unit sometime last year. I make a lot of beef jerky. Still working strong. Plenty of space for 2 lbs of jerky. I would recommend this to any one.
4,Perfect for saving summer tomatoes,"Purchased this a few weeks ago and dehydrated everything in sight. I did peaches (very good), cantalopes (different), and lots of ripe local tomatoes. Everything has turned out very well except for raspberries which took forever to dry and were too tart to eat as snacks. Machine is well made. I moved it into my pantry because the fan was a little loud, but I don't think you could avoid it with any model. Had to soak trays after a particularly juicy batch of tomatoes, but they were easy to clean. I recommend this for anyone who likes to cook by using intense flavors - I have used the dried tomatoes on salads, in sauces, casseroles, etc. It is worth it if you're just doing tomatoes."
4,Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator,"I use a food dryer a lot. The plastic on my old one was falling apart, so I purchased this new one. It works great, and the idea of the drying heat blowing down is a good one, but the electronics being on the top make it top-heavy and more awkward to use that then old one that had the heating unit & fan in the bottom. If it weren't for this, I would have rated this 5 stars."
1,Where's the rest?,"I received the dehydrator, but there's no owner's manual or any other paper work. Seriously? How am I supposed to know how to use it?Very dissatisfied."
4,great product,"Great product, the only complaint is that it should have an automatic timer switch to eliminate the guess work ."
5,Great all-purpose dehydrator,"This is a very nice all-purpose food dehydrator with multiple trays and multiple heat settings that will take care of anything you want to dry. Price is very reasonable, too. I love it!"
5,Great Product - Works great and fast!,"Product is a bit noisy - but not an issue for us. It dries about 4 pounds of meat in about 4-5 hours. The marinades that come with it are very good as well. Trays are removable for easy cleaning! Overall, we're very impressed with this!"
5,"Works well, does everything I wanted",I took a long time to select the proper dehydrator for me. I really like this and it works well.
4,Dog Treat Maker,"Wow! This is a good machine to make healthy human and dog treats. My 11-month-old Alaskan Malamute loves dry sweet potato & apple. The only problem is no timer setting. Otherwise, it is a great dehydrator for the fist time user."
5,Not your grandmother's old dehydrator! Great buy!,"Love this dehydrator. Quiet, easy to use and fast! Comes with a great little book and have found many recipes on Youtube as well.Have been taking advantage of fresh fruit prices as well as the fruits that grow in the yard. Fruit leather has become the family and friends favorite. Looking forward to making jerky next.Easy to clean and the multi temp feature is an absolute plus. Comes with all the racks and trays but I bought two extra fruit trays for the leather. Good thing I did because the kids are eating fruit faster than ever. We even snuck in fruit rollups into the movies instead of candy.The price is certainly right for this product. Shipping was fast and we could not be happier!"
4,No disappointment!,"I received this dehydrator a few days ago and have been very impressed with it's versatility. I've made jerky, fruit chips and even treats for my two over-fed beagles. For the price, this unit cannot be beat. My next project is New Mexican red chile jerky. My only complaint is that there is no on/off switch, you have to plug or unplug it. Great investment and I'm glad I bought it."
1,not worth it,"sounded like a good deal. Excited to receive item. worked very well the first few days with fruits, vegetables then died. Item returned."
3,Hmmm..not too sure.,"I am currently dehydrating slices of kiwi, apples, banana, grape and strawberries.They have been drying for last 12 hours but most of the fruits are nowhere near done.Maybe I am suppose to slice them thiner? I sliced them about 1/4 inches thick as instruction suggested.I don't know but I think this is just a big waste of energy to run the machine for more than 12 hours to get a few ounces of dried fruits.I am going to try to make some beef jerky and maybe I will like the machine more but for now, I don't think I will ever use it to dry fruits. I mean, I can go to Trader Joe's and get a whole bag of dried mango slices for around $2-$3.Another concern is plastic. I am sure these plastics are not BPA free and with the high heat setting for a prolong time, I don't know if this is actually safe for my baby daughter."
1,Total disaster,"Waiting time and delivery were great, After getting my first batch of things to dehydrate ready I turned on the machine and it lasted maybe 20 seconds tops before there was a strong smell of burning plastic and a pop. I now have to go through the sending back and trying to get my money back etc.I was also disappointed that there was no on/off switch and I wasn't very happy with the settings, In general if it hadn't blown straight away it was the right size for what I wanted."
5,for the price you would not find anything better,"i purchased the Nesco FD-75PR 700-Watt Food Dehydrator to make deer jerky and the first time i use it work flawlessly and still works with out any issues this product comes with a small book that show you how to dehydrate just about anything which was very helpful, also it has plenty of surface space by using many trays, so if you are looking for good dehydrator i personally recommend this product."
4,Works Great !!!!,SO for this machine works well. I have been using it non stop for about a week now. I would purchase another.
4,Temperature control a big plus,My wife wanted this model of dehydrator because of the temperature control feature (most dehydrators don't have it) and it turns out that's a pretty important thing to have. We're still experimenting with temperatures/times for different foods but there is definitely a fine line between too hot and just hot enough.Would be five stars for this model if it had a timer built in too (the other important factor in drying being time).
4,Very Good tie track,"Tie rack works well! It has alot of available space for the ties, not to be all bunched up. Easy to mount to the wall. Only problem I have is that one or two of the mounts for the ties were not completely straight, but it could still be used with no problem. OVerall, works great!"
5,Gourgeous ladyfingers,I'm italian and I know these are the best italian ladyfingers!The price is not so bad (compare to Italy).Great for Tiramisu.
2,"I'd like to rate it as 4 stars, but...","I often prepare tiramisu' for my friends, and i bought these ladyfingers twice. Overall the product is good, and the first time it arrived in excellent conditions. However, this second time I am finding that at least 50% of the cookies are broken or even crumbled, and i am quite disappointed."
2,Look elsewhere,"There are so many competing books about Mary Magdalene that an author has to do a really good job to stand out. Unfortunately Mary Thomspon doesn't. Had the book been written 10 or 20 years ago, it might have been considered innovative. With books by Starbird, Cilton, King, and Meyer, Thomspon's book pales in comparison."
3,No Skype Call Waiting,"The quality of calls is great after you download the updated driver from D-Link, HOWEVER, if you are on a skype call and a ""skypein"" call comes in, there is No Way to receive the second call. You hear a beep but no call waiting function. A major flaw. Call waiting only works to swith from skype to landline and landline to skype. I waisted money buying this produck because I don't want to miss any calls."
2,Only works with a Windows OS,"FYI - this device only works with computers running Windows software. If you run Linux - well, move along...nothing to see here...I contacted D-Link about the drivers, and there are no plans to make Linux drivers for this equipment.Note: I own and use other D-Link hardware. This was disappointing because it is not made clear that Windows is a requirement."
5,Was perfect after you download the update,"Easy to setup, but was having problems when I try to change the usb port and calls was dropping after 15 mins. I called the 877's number and they informed me that there is problem with the software that came with the package and to download the update, which came out in 9/2006. Now it is perfect."
2,Very Buggy!,"I just bought one of these and when it works it works well. However, it keeps crashing the skype application after picking up the phone and hanging up while in VOIP mode. It seems that the USB driver is unstable and forcing the skype client to crash. I am currently using D-link driver version 1.16 and skype client version 2.5.0.146."
2,D-Link is a horrible company,"All D-Link products are horrible, miserable hunks of junk. You should not buy this product or the rebranded version from US Robotics. It does not work with the latest versions of Skype. D-Link has not ever updated their buggy drivers. It causes Skype to crash very frequently. The sound quality is poor. To dial a number, you have to prepend your country code (00 in US) even though Skype doesn't require this. There's something wrong with the ring tone, which sounds like it's struggling to ring.Basically, don't ever buy another D-Link product. The products are cheap because they are terrible."
2,Don't try it with Windows 2003 server,"I'm a network engineer by trade, so I have a 2003 server at home. Even with the recommended US robotics driver update that people have used, the software constantly crashes and the device stops working. It is not really spec'd for 2003 use, so maybe it would work better on XP. But it did install without any errors, etc. Skype voice quality is OK when it works. Not as good as a cell phone though. My goal of dropping my verizon line was not met."
1,Not for Vista,"Many products fail to list Vista as an operating system on which they'll work, but they work on Vista nevertheless. This product doesn't work on the Vista OS. I kept it anyway, because it was so cheap. It wasn't worth the trouble to return."
1,Never turned on,"I read the other reviews and was annoyed to find that the one I ordered from Bestbuy (Sept. 2009) was the first version of the hardware with the first version of the software. When plugged in, it never turned on. If you buy this and intent to use it on any modern computer, make sure it is NOT H/W version A1 before buying. Later versions of this might have worked, but this one never even lit up. Beware!"
1,No 64 bit support,There is no driver support for modern PC's - DO NOT BUY. As a PC enthusiast I've been using 64 bit operating systems for 6 yrs as they support more than 3gb of ram... I was appalled to see this product not support that.
2,cheap...,"After using this for a few days it seems to be a pos. When i restart my PC i have to unplug the device and stop the software to get it to work right. its annoying to dial a number, for a local number i have to dial: 001-555-555-5555* (yes you need to push the * key). The device also DOES NOT RING my phones, i emailed d-link but more then a week later and no response...Update:After using this device longer, it suddenly has started to ring my phones which is great.But recently when i unplug and plug the device back in my computer BSODs on me (Blue Screen Of Death - restarts).I wouldn't recommend this, and i would rate it a 1 star after using it longer but i cannot change that.Update2:Well after using non-dlink drivers it worked great for a while, it even rang the phones i had. Then it suddenly stopped working again...If you are looking for different drivers, i think some other reviewer had a link or model # to search for, i believe it was made by US Robotics."
3,Good product after you figure out how to get it to work,Had to go to d-link's web site and download updated drivers for this product to work. The supplied disc is useless and does not even need installed. Currently using it as a coaster for my desk! Took a couple of installs even with updated drivers for Vista to understand that this is a d-link product. Watch that it installs d-link and not another product at time of connection.
3,Works well when connected,"It works when the D-Link software is connected with hardware and Skype. The problem is that it loses connection with the USB box every few hours, and after that you often have to reboot PC to regain connection. D-Link doesn't work hard enough on their software updates."
2,Does not work with Vista 64,"After extensive research, this device is NOT compatible with Windows Vista 64. There are Vista 32 drivers on the vendor's website, however I can not get that to work with Vista 64."
1,Junk,People cannot hear because of echo. The phone disconnected after I tried to call the second time and freezed XP. Don't waste you $$.
3,The Odyssey,"I am Greek by birth,the movie is good as a movie but is against what Homer wrote,and far away from the story itself. All the events that we've been taught at school about Odysseas are barely there,the actor that plays Odysseas is really good just the script sucks! I hope they can make another version closer to the book this time!!"
4,Thanks....it came in a timely fashion,I'm pleased with this purchase. I wish I could say as much for another order. Perhaps the Tale of Two Cities will be forthcoming.
3,Mixed emotions,"I sure had some expectations on thid DVD. After watching the first part (N.Y. ""documentary"" by Kral/Poe) which was just horrible, I was about to throw the DVD in the thrashcan.But the second part by Czech TV is excellent, specially the first bit on Patti Smith Group.All in all, reading ""Please kill me"" and watching this DVD is the closest we can get to the NY-scene mid-70's I guess."
4,Buy the CD. Drop the VINYL like a bad habit!,"This is a fantastic album and the music is just a MUST HAVE. I bought vinyl (the sound quality is great), but the pressing quality is just dismal. I thought I had a bad pressing and returned it (Amazon.com is just amazing). I had a new copy within 2 days and that is just as bad. I've even cleaned both copies on my VPI 16.5 record cleaning machine to no avail. Very subtle improvement, but the pressing is plain noisy, no fill areas and a pathetic way to present such a good album. I was so excited to hear it all analog and it just disappointed me. I am in two minds about returning my second vinyl copy as well and stick with the CD.Should have used RTI for the pressing and should have had Kevin Gray master it...If you're going to go through the trouble of putting a release on vinyl, do it properly or don't do it at all. Simple as that."
2,Doesn't Do Much,"This is a simple toy...very simple. It's a flimsy spring between two receptacles and nothing more. The main point of interest is that when each end is put to the ears of two different people and you ""twang"" the spring, the two people will hear a ""twanging"" noise. It has a bit of an otherworldly, echoey sound but it is not so interesting that the kids use it for more than a couple of seconds before moving on to something else. The toy is described as having the educational value of teaching how sound waves travel between two points. This may be true, but you could make your own simple model with your kids and save some money. By the way, the lightweight spring tangles and gets pulled out of shape very easily so only buy this if your children know how to handle toys carefully. If I'm somehow missing out on a more interesting aspect of this toy, I hope some other reviewer will inform the readers of these reviews."
3,Could easily be replaced as the goto user story book...,"This is a decent book that offers a good amount of information on writing user stories. And in that context, it's definitely worth reading, though partly because it has little competition.The problem is it reads like a biased textbook. The author includes heavy doses of his take on Agile... which he seems to push as gospel rather than an opinion. The book probably could have been more focused, gotten to the meat of user story writing, and been half as long (do publishers pay by the page?)."
5,Sweet & Soulful Blues/Jazz,"These recordings are a nice combinations of blues and jazz. Charles Brown's vocals on this CD are very bluesy and mellow. It seems every single note he plays on the piano has a reason. Also the band on this CD seems to have complete control of each song. Everything seems to flow smoothly as they play from track to track. This CD has some of his finest works . Songs like I Stepped In Quicksand, I Cried Last Night, and Who Will Your Next Fool are some of his finest works. This CD confirms why he was recently inducted into the Rock-n-Roll Hall of Fame.If you are a listener or musician this CD should definitely be in your collection."
4,Great Product,"I have used Herb Pharm products for years, including their trauma oil.Having been in some accidents, I have some back and neck problems and muscle spasms from time to time. This has been very helpful. Other members of my family are now using it.Make sure to shake the bottle well before each use."
3,gobbledegook text in download,"When I downloaded this book I was faced with strange symbols and letters in front of every paragraph and between sentences. Very distracting, to say the least. Since my aging eyes have produced floaters which I've learned to ignore, I guess I'll get used to this as well. You get what you pay for."
3,a novel that shows conflicts between different cultures,"This novel is an example to show the difference between English and Italian culture. In the one hand you see the rigid lifestyle of English people, on the other hand there is the passionate way of life of Italian people. So when the cultures come together and there is no respect between them, conflicts will raise up. This problem is seen in the personality of Harriet who doesn't respect the Italian sort of life that causes a hidden life. On the other hand Philip is able to create relationships with this people and makes compromises."
4,Good Non-greasy Daily Protection,"I have been using the Vanicream Sports SPF 35 daily as a day facial moisturizer for over 7 years. It is thick and so only a dab is needed for the face and does require a little more effort to apply. It does not leave the face looking ghostly white if you have properly worked it into the skin. I even started to use it daily on my little toddler.I recently ordered some more, but did not realized that I ordered the non-sport version which is only SPF 30 instead of SPF 35."
3,I think the product is good...I don't like how thick it is. I sometimes have a hard time spreading it around.,I really like the Vanicream sunscreen. The only complaint that I have is that it is too thick and difficult to spread around and work into the skin.
5,"""So, boozing saved my life? Yeah, you could say that.""","Thank you John Woo for directing this, one of my favorite films of this era in kung fu cinema(or any era really). One of the things that puts this film so high on my list is the great characters and how interesting and unique they are. Even the characters with less screen time shine here nearly as bright as the stars of the film themselves. The assasin Pray for instance, has fantastic presence in all of his scenes and has the best fight scene in the film when he battles Chang to the death (my opinion of course). Characters, plot, action, choreography, twists, humor... it's all here and I can't recommend this film enough (not to mention 30 of the last 40 minutes is non-stop action!). Dragon Dynasty as per usual gives it all the respect it deserves with top notch picture, sound, and special features."
1,As bad as one could expect,"There is nothing positive I could write about this horrific film. No acting, stupid plot, even more silly dialogues. And ""actors""? They are as hot as ice (unless you are into feminine guys)...Waste of time and money."
5,Great movie!,I really liked this movie. The film is very honest and gives a different view of the gay community. It's very real. I really enjoyed the fantasy scenes that they show along the movie. They are really good! The 'comedy/humor' part of the movie is very well done. It also have some touching moments. And has really cute actors! I recommend this movie.
4,An interesting look at early careers,"The most interesting thing about this album is the band. Often overlooked as an important recording, the musicians on this record are all legends in their own rights. To hear what they sounded like at such an early part of their recording careers is extremely gratifying. I highly recommend it."
2,mixed emotions,"Hmm i have to say im a little surprised by the bad quality of some of the movies, and i didnt expected HD Quality here.But some really look like they were filmed off a moviescreen with handycam.The movies r also a mix from very good down to very bad.So my advice : This is only, and i mean ""only"" for big fans of the warmovie genre."
5,Not for the faint-of-heart,"Many years ago, when I was working at a bar/restaurant, a transient bartender/DJ noticed that I was listening to a lot of reggae. One night he handed me this album and said ""It is not for the faint-of-heart"". He was right. For better or for worse, the roots of Rap are right here. It's a classic.Note: The original LP is worth seeking-out for the backside sequence of photos which shows U-Roy disappearing behind a cloud of ganja smoke."
4,OK for what it is,"This dictionary is identical to _Y Geiriadur Cyfoes_, published in Wales in 1992. Its editor is H. Meurig Evans, M.A., not ""M.A. Evans H. Meurig,"" as Amazon has it. check the author listing to see other editions, but don't click on the name as it's given on this Web page! As is evident from the sample pages, there are a lot of entries, but individual entries are very short. An early-stage learner should consider Gareth King's _Pocket Modern Welsh Dictionary_, which has a much shorter entry list but a great deal more information per entry. Price is comparable."
2,"Great when working, garbage when it quit","As someone with night blindness who has stairs, in the dark and needs a nightlight to flip on nearby--I thought this was Great. And it was, for almost 2 years--till it just upped and died. Out of warranty--it now is a $30 paperweight of garbage. Too bad. Look at another item than this, given its recurrent rate of not working."
2,"Great concept, BUT...","This is a great design; soft light automatically on during dark hours with LED bulb that doesn't constantly burn out AND/OR 3 bright LED lights that come on when unit senses motion & during power failure and that can also be used as a flashlight. However, like one of the other reviewers reported, the 3 bright lights soon start to flicker which greatly reduces their brightness and could induce a migraine. At least the nightlite still works."
2,not worth it,I purchased 4 of these and the top LEDs on 3 of the units started flickering within 2 months. I like the features but the product is poorly made.
5,Every recipe deelishhhhh!,"Thanks, Judith! I will follow you and your recipes to the ends of the earth! Your recipes are meticulous AND user friendly! And MORE importantly, always delicious. My taste buds thank you, my heart thanks you, my friends thank you, but my hips are a little pissed off!"
4,Blessed & Thensome,"For Elton John, the music industry really has proven to be a force to be determined with. He has truly kept the musical pace going for quite sometime in the fields today. What makes hime spark is his ballads, ""Blessed and Bold"". With his song Blessed, the third single from his 1995 album Made In England, he truly seemed to put a simple case of piano soul in position. Although not as dominant as his first single, Believe, it showcases a simple tone that speaks just from the piano. Nothing extraordinarilly conjured and produced, just a simple melody that is intimate. If you can't find this as a single, you have to get Made In England for this song from the legendary Rocket Man."
2,A thoroughly average movie.,"Chris Rock is one of the funniest comedians around. Unfortunately it didn't come out in this movie. Perhaps it was the poor script, or maybe it was the lack of chemistry with the female lead.In any event the movie simply doesn't do justice to Rock's style of humor. It was very evidently toned down to appeal to the masses, and because of that it simply didn't work.While the plot of this movie has potential this version of it was simply boring.Don't spend your money on it, you'll only be dissapointed."
3,This brilliant comedian is no actor,Down to earthWell Chris plays a typical smart talking Afro-American who runs into death only to find out he wasn't due yet. So he is sent down to play a rich white billionaire. The rest is predictable and typical of a movie of this sort. Although Chris has certain acting problems this movie is a ride and even though it is way too predictable at times you still receive a lot of fun from the jokes and style of Chris. A disappointing DVD but isn't all bad and should only be an addition to your DVD collection if you are a Chris Rock fan. That's why it is in my DVD collection.Friday
4,The best movie director you have never heard of,This package has seven of Sturgis's movies from the 1940s.I gave it four stars only because I would have liked some extra material. People like William Demarest were still in television in the 1970s. I would have liked to see his stories about working with Preston Sturgis was like.But still it's a whole world you see of America as it was in the FDR World War 2 days. Nobody is air-brushed and you feel these are real people. My favorites would be The Great McGinty and Hail the Conquering Hero. In the bar scenes in both movies you can taste the beer!
5,MASTERPIECE,"Lost in the autumnal DVD delivery, there is the Criterion release of Preston Sturges's SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS. Don't overlook this peculiar DVD, it will be one of the essential DVD releases of the year 2001.Preston Sturges directed half of dozen masterpieces in the early forties in Hollywood and is considered now as the Father of the writers-directors guild. Nobody before him had the right to have his name printed before the title of the movie. Writer and director, Preston Sturges had a career à la Orson Welles : flamboyant but so short.Enjoy the wonderful 76 minutes documentary ""The Rise and Fall of an American Dreamer"" presented as a bonus feature of this release, enjoy the only opportunity to admire Veronica Lake on DVD, enjoy this festival of smart dialogs and comic scenes. In short, enjoy.A DVD zone your library."
1,"Great films, very poor quality transfer","This is a great collection of films by a comedy genius.Sadly the transfer done by Universal is muddy, without contrast and grainy. In fact, it was so bad, (and far worse than any of the other 40's films in my collection), that I had to ask myself if this was a pirated print!By comparing this collection to original videotapes of the same films as well as off-air tapings from the Studio Universal channel, one can see that this collection simply did not receive the quality transfer treatment that was truly merited.What a shame. Preston Sturges deserved better."
3,The Criterion version is better.,"I bought this Universal 100th Anniversary DVD of ""Sullivan's Travels"" thinking it would be the same quality as the Criterion DVD that came out a few years ago. It's ALMOST the same but the quality of the Criterion version is better overall. Also, the Criterion version has a bunch of bonus features that are not on this DVD. It's a good thing I didn't sell the Criterion version.It looks like Universal is just repackaging previously released DVDs for it's 100th Anniversary set instead of remastering their classic movies."
1,Why aren't the titles available separately?,"Being a major fan of Preston Sturges' comedies, I bought all of the separate releases when they came out: Sullivan's Travels, The Lady Eve, Hail the Conquering Hero and The Palm Beach Story (and also Miracle of Morgan's Creek which is not in this set). I need only Christmas in July and the Great McGinty to complete my collection. DVD manufacturers: I challenge you to explain why you think I should pay for the whole set just to get those two movies. One star given as an expression of my disgust at this totally transparent and cynical strategy to rob movie fans of their money."
4,R U Absent?,"This CD is bomb. I love to hear a good compilation. It's all about the art in generating a disc that flows.I've been a fan of Clinton's work for a long time (two concerts). These other reviews are just from critics stuck in the 70's. It's called G Funk not Funk Hop and it's only a couple of songs. Clinton's songs and production with people like Outkast, Too $hort, or Dre... You can't denie that this funkster has Hip Hop in his soul.The whole CD is crazy bomb, Del's Hip Hop is hit or miss really (excentric)... heance the 4 star rating. The reason I bought this CD is because of the song Somthing Stank. I heard that song at the concerts and loved it and loved Shondra for rapping it, but never saw it recorded until now. It's completely different besides the some of the lyrics. I liked it better done over the 808 but now it's just a funk song, oh well - it's fine.Buy the CD if your a die hard fan, buy it used if you want to hear a good colaberation of funk love."
1,This is not what you think it is,"This is a reprint of 1962 book, copied from a library copy and rebound. It is a public domain reprint, as is stated inside the book. It contains some information, but the isotopes are limited to what i believe is reactor produced isotopes. That said, it's hard to read many of the isotope numbers. Hope you're good at guessing"
2,Come On!,"This ain't hot at all. He get 2 stars just for trying and he saved. If you want to hear REAL Christian hip hop Please check out Lecrae, DA T.R.U.T.H.,116 Clique: The Compilation Album, Sean Slaughter, Mr Del, Trip Lee, Tedashii, and Flame. Any of these cd's will make you throw this one away. I'm sorry but I gotta keep it Real!"
2,I am sure the movie will be better.,"I would not recommend this book. It is claims to be non-fiction but it doesn't seem authentic. While I am sure her life story is fascinating, this book definitely is not interesting."
4,Miracles still happen,"I am a German high-school student and I read ""Desert Flower"" in my English class. Normally I would not have read a book like that. It is not the type of book I would pick out of a bookshelter. But in this case I really liked the book. I could not stop reading. It was described really well, you could feel with Waris through the situations the poor little girl had to go through. All her emotions and worries were so real and touching, they just overwhelmed me. Her life is almost like a miracle from the bible and at some parts it is a little bit overemphasised how lucky she was. But it is still good to know that miracles happen even in our days. It is also interesting for me to see that there is an alternative to our stressful life. There is a way to stick to yourself and she shows it to everyone."
4,Mean and...sophisticated.,"The late great Stevie Ray Vaughan had many jazz hints in his output,however,Clarence'Gatemouth'Brown takes all that to an extreme-a good one-delivering a powerful and authoritative fusion album,bound to please not only those stepped in the Texas blues tradition,but also those more inclined toward jazz and funk.His 1992 album is simply a must!"
2,Not what I was hoping for.,I am a beginner in child photography and I bought this book hoping it would help me get a better understanding of how to take pic of little ones.This is not a How -To book.I guess I should of looked at the reviews and author right ups before buying.I also bought one of his other books(How to photograph your baby)on the same day and this should have been the only one I should have bought because it was exactly what I was looking for (five stars).I guess this would make a great baby shower gift though.Cedric G.
5,A PIONEER AND A MODEL FOR THE FUTURE JAZZ ORGANIST LIKE JOEY DEFRANCESCO AND TONY MONACO VOL. 2,"This record was recorded at Pacific Jazz Studios in 1961 and 1962.The musicians are:R. GROOVE HOLMES - organJOE PASS - guitarLARANCE MARABLE - guitarLARANCE MARABLE - drumsLEROY HENDERSON - drumsThe sound quality is great and special !!!This artist is a model for the great jazz organists Joey Defrancesco and Tony Monaco that sometimes uses his style, so this jazz organist has been important for the Organ Jazz !!!Enjoy it !!!P.S.:Check up my 3 listmanias about the ORGAN JAZZZ !!! 120 albums from the best selection for you !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
4,nice single worth a couple of buck,"The Beatles / Free as a Bird (four song CD): The song ""Free as a bird"" is worth having. The other three cuts are nice. If you are spending more than a couple of bucks for this, you are being ripped-off."
5,"""Reflecting Pool"" is a MUST see. What a Ride !!!","The ""Reflecting Pool"" is a dark ride to the depths of intrigue. This riveting journey will leave you forgetting everything else, but the story will haunt your thoughts long after the end credits are read.I'd give this 6 thumbs up if I could!! Get copies of this powerful film for everyone you know, and then talk with them about it. It'll give you years of fascinating conversation.Then send a copy to your Congressman and Senator."
1,Doesn't work with OS X...,"Even though it states ""MAC"" compatible. So I would consider this false advertising.I returned it."
1,I'd enter 0 stars if I could,"The reliability of this product is terrible. It loses connections frequently under both XP Professional and Vista. I haven't tried it on my MacBook yet, but I'm not going to bother."
2,not the best,"The issue with this product is to establish connectivity. Every time my PC goes into stand by, I need to restart it if I want the dongle to connect with the wireless hub. Sometimes, I opt for not using it since I'd have to reboot my PC several times a day."
3,"Amusing, However Dated","Charles Pike (Henry Fonda) is the target of a scam by Jean Harrington (Barbara Stanwyck) and her father aboard a luxury liner from South America to New York. Charles had just spent a year in the jungle looking for exotic snakes, while his father, of Pike's Ale fame, paid for the expedition. Jean and her father were card sharps who originally figured to fleece him with cheating at cards, but then Jean and Charles fell in love.On the whole, a rather funny but not terribly original romantic comedy from the era when movies were trying to get people to forget about war and other unpleasantness. Everyone is either wealthy or striving to appear so in order to scam the wealthy. The women are all beautiful, the men all rich.Well, it was fun, anyway."
5,Still Holds Up Today,"Preston Sturges did some terrific comedies, mostly in the 40's, & this is definitely one of them. Barbara Stanwyck & Henry Fonda are both great, along with a fine supporting cast including, Charles Coburn, William Demarest & Eugene Pallette. From the opening credits, a cartoon snake squirming down the left side of the names & eventually running through Preston's name, to the last line (which I will refrain from spoiling!)it's fun all the way! This is one comedy that could be redone with an intelligent rewrite for the times & good direction. The only reason I would even consider this thought is so the younger generation can enjoy what they would probably bypass due to the age & color (or lack of being it's black & white).They are missing a fun story & lots of laughs."
1,not much use,"Readers looking for a comprehensive introduction to or reference work about Continental philosophy will be disappointed. The essays collected here were, in most cases, obviously not written with inclusion in this volume in mind. One suspects that most of the writers fished their ""contributions"" from the drawer to which they had consigned otherwise unpublishable work. Most of the articles deal only with a single arcane interpretive point, belying their sweeping titles (""Kant,"" ""Schelling,"" etc.) Many, the non-initiate suspects, are in fact byzantinely-phrased polemics against rival scholars. For a clearly-written, synoptically interpretive, and unpretentiously thoughtful overview of the topics purportedly addressed in the Critchley-Schroeder volume, see David West's Introduction to Continental Philosophy."
4,FUN AUDIO BOOK OF DR. NO,"For those of us that are 007 fans, this is an interesting mustown tape. Not quite the same as the movie version, but more complex -explores a much more sinister side of the Dr. No character than the movie conveys. Well worth the listen."
3,"5 stars for action, 1 for racism","I'm sure most readers know about the rank racism that runs rampant in the James Bond books. Yes, it was a ""sign of the times"" and all that, but that doesn't make it any more bearable to read today. Such a shame to mar otherwise good books with this ugliness.The racism cannot be overlooked, but if you can get through it, the action sequences at the end are extremely well-written and exciting. I was certainly sucked in, holding my breath, even though I knew darn well that James Bond must live through it and triumph over evil. A book that can build that type of suspense is still worth a read."
4,Classic Fleming,"Ian Fleming's love of the Caribbean is nowhere more apparent than in this fun James Bond romp. If you enjoy James, you'll love this classic Fleming."
4,Great bandage protection,"Very nice protection for a paw or lower leg bandage. Most veterinarians do not know this product exists and require that you return frequently for bandage changes due to moisture or bandage wear-out.**Tip** Vetrap or elastic bandaging needs to be high enough on leg for the boot top to grip on to. Otherwise, it tends to slip down. I used this on my dog's front leg.Bottom wears out if dog continues dragging foot or walks continuously on asphalt, gravel, or concrete. I had to reinforce mine with nylon webbing and went through two boots in eight weeks. Worth the investment versus frequent bandage changes and risk of moisture into wound and having dog wear an cone-type collar.If bottom of foot can heal without bandaging one might consider Bark N' Boots Grip Trex by Ruff Wear. Sold individually by company."
3,Too quick...,This book ended too quickly. The time frame was a bit fast. Ryan and Maggie barely know each other at the end of the book.
2,It had great start but that last 100 pages were terrible !,"This book takes place in a small town in modern day Wyoming. The romance between Maggie and Ryan and sweet but was very dissatisfying. Maggie has very low self-esteem and Ryan is just lost even when he finds Maggie. I would not recommend this book it had a good start but it just didn't have a spark. I would suggest books by Kate Angell, Ellen Byerrum, Elin Hilderbrand, and Marlys Millhiser instead."
3,Not enough time for romance.,"The story in a whole was good. But I felt Ms. Schulze spent too much time on the back ground of Maggie and Ryan. Or should I say not enough time on their romance. We only got three of four chapter on them as a couple. With a few more chapers this book would had been perfect. The characters were delightful, it just ended too soon."
2,Disappointing story----not Ms. Schulze's best work!!!,"This story had potential. However, the story line dragged on forever. This is not Ms. Schulze's best work, and she is capable of very good work. If you want to read a great story by Ms. Schulze then read a A Very Convenient Marriage."
2,"Disappointed with Dallas Schulze's new book, The Marriage.","I'm normally a big fan of Dallas Schulze, but I must say I was somewhat disappointed with The Marriage. I've always enjoyed her books because she always emphasizes character development, creating people with personalities that jump off the page. The Marriage seemed quickly thrown together. Both Ryan Lassiter and Maggie Drummond, who supposedly fall in love without ever getting to know eachother, lack the depth of Shulze's usual characater's. The believability level is low. The couple meets two or three times, shares one kiss, then ends up married. There is little if any struggle to make their marriage work, and we are expected to believe that, although the two haven't learned anything about one another, they fall in love. I'm sorry to say I cannot reccommend this book, since I have always enjoyed Dallas Shulze's novels. I certainly hope the next one is better."
3,Not bad - not great,"Throughout GO, Dexter has a huge, fat sound. It really tugs you when he holds one of those low tones. I was really excited to get this CD and listen to it. I can understand that its balance and craft is really appreciable. However, I think it is boring. He mainly follows the melody line ad nauseum, with the odd flourish that uncomfortably borders on liquid cheeze. Kind of a diet-Jazz, it holds its own, but I think the songs he picked drag it down. Worth checking out, though, to make your own opinion."
1,Excellent product,"Marti Michell products are excellent. I am making a Jenny Haskins quilt and tried another brand and it flopped, big time so I bought these and wow, what a wonderful difference."
2,Flimsy construction. Bad design.,"I had read another person's comments about how easily the lid cracked and that is so right. The clips just cannot be arranged to store evenly, and, after finally giving up on trying, the lid just snapped when I tried to close it over the rollers and clips. The unit is, also, quite large and takes up more space than any other hot rollers I've owned. Don't waste your money."
3,happy,I had never purchased this product before. It is a good product. I would recommend the product to anyone.
4,"Good quality pump, float switch is not ideal","The pump appears to be good quality and solid. The float switch, though, did not work for my use and I needed to modify it before it was effective. I did not send it back, since I knew I could make the modification myself.The (under-house) sump application required that the water level be kept under about 10 inches of depth. However, the float mechanism would not trigger until the depth reached at least 16 inches, probably closer to 18. The float needs to rise above the unit (before activation) which is much too high to effectively keep the water in check. My previous pump had a fixed float on a rod. It would trigger the pump at about four inches in depth. I did not realize that this new pump required so much water to be present before it would kick on. I did not see an option for the fixed-type float trigger."
5,Superior Thermoplastic sump pump,"A great sump pump. Very durable construction. Easy to deploy. A good flow rate. Great pump, and a great value."
4,compact & powerful,small enough to fit inside small spaces but powerful enouigh to push the water up ten feet. the float switch can be adjusted to several depths of water.
2,More like temporary pump,"It maybe work for about a year I tried to fix but that did not work finally I settled for the Wayne Water Systems VIP50 1/2 HP 2,500 GPH Submersible Utility Water Pump.It cost a few more dollars but has never failed love it works every time..."
5,Informative and Easy to Read,"I did not expect much from this book that was required for a college course. I was happily surprised when I found myself not only learning from it but also enjoying it. Badke does not write like the average text book, he writes like a person would talk. I would recommend this to other people because the information is useful and it is an easy read."
5,A very accessible intro to information literacy,"Mr. Badke explains the research process with such wit -- no one else can make metadata so interesting! This is definitely an entertaining but also highly informative introduction to the research process. I wish I'd had this book when I started college. Should be required reading for high schools, community colleges and college freshmen."
4,code orange,I thought Code Orange was an interesting and exiting book.I like how the author never gave away what was going to happen next.I would recomend this book for anyone who is interested in reading a short and thrilling book.
4,Fun Product,"I was cautious about this program and if it would work. I have a Motorolla phone and at first I had some difficulty but after a few tries it works wonderfully! I have made about 6 ringtones and all have successfully went to my phone. What the instructions don't tell you (at least in my case) is that once the ringtone is created you download it from a website. If you enter the website manually into your phone it didn't work for me. However, if I let my phone choose ""go to site;"" it downloaded perfectly! It was worth the time. You do have to be able to download from the web with your phone and receive text messages. The program sends your phone a text message with the web link."
4,The prettiest monsters in town,"Rowena Morrill is a very fine artist with an excellent eye for detail, just how good is revealed by her portraits of Isaac Asimov & Anne McCaffrey . I do have a couple of miner gripes some of her characters assume rather contrived poses, take the cover for example. Could anybody smile beatifically and thoughtfully drape a lily , while an animated statue grasped your leg ? The colours she uses are extremely vivid and some of her monsters are so garish they tend to Kitsch rather than visceral. But I`m a sucker for Brom and compared with his creations anything short of Giger looks tame, so feel free to disagree. These quibles apart this remains a collection of some extremely well done paintings and would be a worthy part of any fantasy art collection."
5,The rent is too damn high and the Planet Ocean is too damn heavy !,"This is my fourth Omega and 2nd Seamaster (I still keep a 300M Quartz) and this P.O. weighs almost nine ounces even after removing some of the links.I was heavier with thicker wrists when I purchased it but losing weight thinned my knobby ulna out and the Omega got reeally uncomfortable.I'm versed in adjusting links and spent some time determining which side of the bracelet to adjust and twaked it with the included half link before determining I needed an extra half link (~$75) to adjust it comfortably.Definitely try one in person at your jewelers to determine if you're comfortable with a piece this big, even my 50mm Invicta SubAqua isn't as heavy and the Omega taught me firsthand what an extradited fugitives wrists feels like.The links can be resized with a simple band adjuster of suitable size such asSE Watchband Link Remover Tooland I keep one of these at the office and home."
2,obsolete,"The book is mostly obsolete. Consider first its description of the personal computer. Nine years have elapsed since it was published. Moore's Law has been proceeding unabated during this time. Over 4 cycles. Which means that today's computers are much faster, have much larger disks and are cheaper. Plus, today's monitors are more likely to be flat screen, instead of a vacuum tube.Then look at its discussion of the Internet/Web. Many of the now common usages had yet to become popular, or even exist. Such things like blogging, or swapping music. Or Instant Messaging. Or playing video. Or listening to streaming radio stations that push their programs onto the Internet. No mention of social networks."
2,Still mystified,"I was lookiing for understanding the behavior, not a text book on the brain. Not so much help in the real world."
4,Borderline Personality Disorder Demystefied,"This book was informative, but troubling to read. Though it promises to reassure those struggling with this disorder, the prognosis looks pretty bleak to me, even after reading the book. Could that be a part of the disorder, or could it just be that this book failed to reassure me? In any case, I am still looking for the answers to the tough questions that BPD pose to the sufferer."
3,Easy to read and explanations of challenges good.,"The book is easy to read and understand. Although I bought it with the intention of giving it to a relative that has BPD, after reading it myself, I decided it might not be such a good idea...might be discouraging and/or give him an excuse for his behavior."
3,Well written but didn't support the title,"I liked the book in general.The author has a personal interest in BPD after having a sister who suffered from the disorder,and he seems to really have been affected by their relationship,to the point of guiding his career choice.The book hardly demystified BPD for me.It is as much or more a mystery for me,in it's causes and manifestations.The author suggests that his sisters BPD was caused by his mother taking pain medication during her pregnancy,based on his mother's opinion.Interesting theory but speculative at best.Despite these nits,it is a well written book and the author really gives you the feeling that he is compassionate and even personally interested in helping people recover from this horrible illness."
5,Absolutly outstanding,"I have only resently become a Buddy fan and have loved all thing i have listened to of him. while i write this review im listening to the Big Swing Face album. i recomend it to anyone. All tunes are amazing. The tune Wack Wack is a must to listen to. The Norwegion Wood Arrangement,well,what can i say,i love it. Anyone and everyone will love this CD no matter who they are."
5,Works wonders,"Our living room is drafty. the rugbuddy has made it so comfortable! We have small children, and they spend lots of time playing on the floor. Now they can play and be cozy. Added plus...we haven't seen a big spike in our electric bill!!"
5,"burn electricity, get warm, and save money!","Like many other buyers of this product, we have an old (1950s) and badly-insulated house.The living room sits on top of the unheated garage, and so it gets cold.And the thermostat for the house is in the living room.So to get the temp in the living room to 70 , the upsatirs of the house approaches 80!Then we installed the rug buddy: burn 1/3 of a kilowatt/hour, get warm feet (the coldest part of the room before!), get the room temp to 70 with less furnace output, and so keep the upstairs warm but not hot.It's a great idea and it really works."
4,Capone,"This is one of Sylvester Stallone's early movies and a very good film about Al Capone. The one I bought is written in portugese on the cover, but the spoken language is in english/spanish or portugese, your choice. So, it's not a problem."
4,The Real Frank,"Even though the sound quality is not the best on this CD (it was recorded on tape in passing) , it is still an excellent example of Frank interacting with his audience and feeding off them. He does most of his favorites including mine ""One For My Baby And One More For The Road "" here which is hard to find and is a superb rendition with great piano backup.The Red Norvo quintet swings well on these tunes as we get Frank's voice at the peak of its expressiveness (although not peak quality ) Don't forget he had that burst blood vessel and smoked heavily so that only gave him a small window in the 50's where his voice, the blues about Ava and the Riddle arrangements produced his really powerful stuff.This CD is a must certainly for any fan of the old standards and for anyone with no ""Sinatra's"""
5,Good and working,This device works with my old PS2 wireless mouse. Just install the adapter and all is good to go. Now I am able to use my wireless mouse with this cheap adapter.
4,A true crime guilty pleasure,"The writer effectively used foreshadowing to keep me in suspense chapter after chapter. Hard to feel much sympathy for the victim who led a dangerous secret life, and continued to use people. Word of advice: don't look at the pictures until you reach them reading."
4,Two-Fisted Mama!,"Boy how I miss artists like Katie. The great legends that laid down the foundation of the Blues (not to mention Rock 'n Roll) are fast leaving us. This album is great from beginning to end, with some great barrel-house piano playing, coupled with soulful vocals and a true sense of joy. Get this before it goes OOP!!"
3,I'm feelin' kinda lucky sorta.,"This CD single has an extended mix of the radio version and a near indistinguishable remix. If you love the original and just can't get enough, this single is for you. Otherwise, skip it."
4,mi libro Rojo Gran adicion a mi cocina !!!!!,"Me encanto mi Libro. FUE UN PERFECTO regalo de mi novio :)El famoso libro Rojo, 5 EStrellas ...Indiscutibles por el contenido.Una variada Y excelentes recopilacion de clasicas recetas de la comida Venezolana, con la sazon del centro del pais. Yo particularmente he usado sus recetas para las Hallacas, pues es el sabor que mas se asemeja a las hallacas de mi familia.Pienso q lo recordaba de mejor calidad, respecto a la ediciones anteriores del libro(yo poseo la 32 edicion de Bolsillo con tapa Blanda). El envio por correo, tomo como 3 semanas, pues vino desde Venezuela. Y vino ligeramente maltratado en una esquina(pienso q debieron empacarlo mejor) :(Recomendaria tenerlo de Texto Basico en la cocina, si sabes de los sabores de la cocina casera Venezolana y te gusta Cocinar ."
2,I Could and Did Put It Down,"this book in one word is disappointing...the characters, the plot, everything was so predictable I skipped entire chapters and still knew exactly what had happened...i usually like Pella's work, but this one fell flat...everything happened too easily, without any hardship...it was a very happy-everything-happens-the-way-we-want-it story...sorry, but it wasn't my cup of tea."
4,Texas Angel,"Although I thought the book started out slow and continued that way until about half way, I'm glad I stuck with it. By the middle of the book, the plot picked up and I became entralled with the characters. While I liked each character in their own ways, I could have wrung Benjamin's neck. He was probably the most frustating factor in the entire book, which after a while adds depth to the story."
3,"Nice ingredients, but too greasy","I was enthusiastic about this lotion when I read the ingredients list. I love that everything is organic. Some of the scents work and some don't. The thing that keeps me from buying this a second time is that it is simply too greasy. It's fine for the body, but not for the hands. My hands left a greasy film on anything I touched after I put this lotion on."
3,"NOT AS FUNNY AS THE ORIGINAL, BUT IT'S AN OK MOVIE","THIS TIME, WAYNE & GARTH RETURN TO PUT ON A ROCK CONCERT NAMED WAYNESTOCK. IT'S PRETTY FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING BUT IT DOESN'T QUITE COMPARE TO THE ORIGINAL. BUT THIS SEQUEL WILL MOST LIKELY SATISFY FANS OF THE ORIGINAL. THIS MOVIE'S GOOD FOR A FEW LAUGHS IF YOU'VE BEEN HAVING A BAD DAY."
4,"Helpful, if you study hard.","The book has a lot of details that need to be taken in for the certification test. As with any test, you get out of it what you put in."
1,time lost,"This was such a bad movie that I couldn't finish watching it. Just pathetic. Inept acting, visually stulifying, embarrasing hodge podge of dung. Homer or Dante treated with the skill and depth lavished on Tolkein Trilogy would be breathtaking and only WetaWorkshop capable of doing it. Alas"
2,A Forgettable Epic,"This is not a great film, it is far too long, and it is just about void of any great acting. If I had to choose ""Best Actor"" for this film, it would be Eric Bana. Really an excellent job considering the script he had to work with. Apart from that, the other actors would have been just as convincing if they were on a Greek stage holding dramatic masks to their faces. It seemed Brad Pitt was always trying to act but just couldn't jive with the character. I actually wanted to laugh at some parts, such as when he was ""acting"" angry while calling Hector out to fight. Terrible. Peter O'Toole, though once a great actor, is just too old, and I hate to say that. I sincerely believe that Brad Pitt and Peter O'Toole were recruited because the producers wanted some ""big name"" appeal. Shame. To set the record straight, I do not dislike Brad Pitt. I thought he was great in ""Fight Club"" and other films. But perhaps he should avoid the epic."
5,Troy Review,"It 's beautiful package color. It's a great movie with a lot of special features, the sound e imagem was amazing too."
3,Don't expect what you read in Homer,"Troy is an okay movie that, unfortunately, could have been great if it had been adapted by Homer's Iliad instead of ""inspired"" by it. That said, it does have its bright spots...1 of my 3 stars goes to Sean Bean's Odysseus, and the other 2 go to Eric Bana and his portrayal of Hector. Prior to seeing this film, my only knowledge of Eric Bana was that he played the Hulk (and I never saw that movie)...his excellent performance here came as a wonderful surprise, and I hope he gets recognition for it when the awards season comes around."
2,Horribly Overdone,"I enjoy historical features of any kind and am not really particular about abosolute details, after all, a movie is entertainment. THIS movie, however, had nothing that appealed to me. I definitely agree with the other reviewers that the movie lacks chemistry and the characters are flat. I'll add that the dialogue is predictable, full of cliche and lacks believability, so much so that I have currently paused the movie to read reviews to determine whether to waste the next hour watching the rest of it and return it to my rental store. I enjoy Brad Pitt in most movies, this was an insult to his ability as an actor. He looks good, though. ""Helen"" is a disgrace of bad acting. The battles were okay, but overdone, the diagolue overdone, the sappy-ness overdone ""please don't fight...please..."". By the way, I'll second the question, why does Brad Pitt have a British accent?"
2,Blonde Greeks?,"Iknow. Everyone is tired of hearing this, but the film is not even remotely related to ""The Illead"". I won't go into all of the details. Read the book if you want a good story. The acting (with the exception of *sacrilage!* Brad Pitt and Orlando Bloom) was decent, the battle scenes were fairly well done. The costumes were OK (that is if you like a lot of tye-dyed tunics)and the scenery (llamas in ancient Greece?) wasn't too bad. I would, however, love an explaination of why there were ancient Greek ruins in ancient Greece."
3,Not winning an Oscar by a long shot,Here are the best things about this movie:1) Brad Pitt all Buffed up2) Eric Bana all Buffed up3) Brad Pitt in a Tunic4) Eric Bana in a tunic5) Brad Pitt getting NakedEverything else is just a special effect.
5,"""I LOVE IT!!!""","This movie got a lot of bad reviews. A LOT!! Needless to say, I was suspicious about whether I should rent it or not. I'm so glad I did! This movie did not deserve those bad revies. Not at all. The cinematography is awesome and so is the acting. Brad Pitt did an awesome job as Achilles and Eric Bana was superb. I love Hector throughout this movie. He was awesome and then he went and died. I was crying, I admit it. I also loved Achilles. The only character I didn't like was Paris. I love Orlando Bloom and he did a good job acting, but I didn't like his character. I respect that all the actors also did all their own fighting. Ultimately, this has to be my favorite movie. I salute the actors."
5,Great Epic - Must See for Men,"I believe Troy to be one of the greatest epic films ever made. Except for a few sexual scenes the movie is clean - they could have left those scenes out. Effects were a knockout - very real battle scenes - awe spiring when the Greek army approached Troy to do battle. Well written and never a dull moment. I especially liked how they portrayed Hector as a man of honor, valor, and brave to the end. Hector became my hero of the movie and one of my all time favorite characters.This movie has made my top five favorite movies due to the cinematography, plot, actors, battle scenes, and effects. I felt I went back in time when I watched the movie.The special features were very interesting and gave good insight on the immensity of making such a movie.Men - if you like battles, brave soldiers, and great special effects this movie is for you.Enjoy!!!!"
4,alter-dimensional TROY,"What the world REALLY needs is a blu-ray of TROY with the Gabriel Yared score. Talk about instructional. Two scores, same movie. The general audience isn't aware of the power of the soundscape to inform the image."
5,My Favourite Blu-Ray So Far,"I recently purchased a Samsung HLT6187SX and I must say this is my absolute favourite viewing experience so far. I loved Casino Royale and Ratatouille but this film also looked amazing in Blu-Ray. The costumes and colors and the Agean sea were stunning to say the least. The story was captivating from beginning to end and the fight scenes were very well done. To the one clown who said the movie was ""boring"" must have been smoking something.I support both formats and I hope the studios will release more of these epic films in high-def. Blu-Ray & HD-DVD were made for films like TROY. They look fabulous on a widescreen hdtv with a good home theater system.This is a definite must own imo!!Enjoy!!"
2,Why didn't W. Petersen...,"... read Homer (the original story was much better than the one he cooked up), and why couldn't he get a real music composer, since the James Horner should have been credited only as ""sound effects"" (and a very poor one at that). I'm sure to keep away from any movie he will pollute....."
5,Movie of the Year,"Troy is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has action, love, and drama. I know alot of people say its a bloody movie, but people fought bloody wars with swords, arrows, and many other blood drenching weapons long ago. Besides the battle scenes, this movie has deeper meaning. It potrays the lust for power and glory, then lets the main character realise that there is more to life than fame. Their is love, honor, and the usual good things in life. I like the fact that there are no gods and goddesses or any other mythical characters in this movie. It tells the story of humans and their struggles which gives the viewer a sense of being able to relate to the characters."
2,260 minutes of fluff,"really there are better things that you can do with 2 hours and 40 minutes....read a book, rake your yard, call an old friend....on the other hand you can get poor acting, poor directing, a laughable script that will have you shaking your head by watching Troy, you decide."
1,"Epic poop, don't subject the kids to this soft core porn.","Awash in nudity and bad acting. The dimunitive Mr. Pitt moons the audience literaly. It opens with Brad Pitt in a threesome and features Orland Bloom, looking very teeny, he has some really gross ugly naked guy flashing The actors are constasntly changing clothes. CGI battle scenes look like a bad video game. I really wanted to like it but it was relentlessly corny."
1,Not as good as it should have been,"Well, I just saw this movie at a pre-screening at my college's union, and I have to say that it just wasn't that good. If you have read either of Homer's epics, then you will be severely disappointed. If you haven't read those books, then the poorly written script and bad characterization may not upset you that much. The only way that I would be willing to see this movie is if twenty or so of my friends dragged me along with them and paid for my ticket. This was a movie that I was greatly looking forward to, and it just plain stunk, like many of the movies that have been released lately."
4,Very good,"I was never a fan of Brad Pitt but he made this movie. He was superb as a fearless warrior. Can't say the same about Orlando Bloom as a Paris. He came across as too effeminine and the thought of him as a fighter just doesn't fly. Yes, this movie is hardly historicly accurate but still, very enjoyable to watch."
1,Gladiator wannabe,This movie recieves one star due to the fact in can interest others to read the book. The movie itself was awful and it did not resemble the book. It was a Gladiator wannabe with the Achilles character and music score. The movie just had the characters from the Illiad and that was it. The story changed so much it annoyed many people. It is best to read the book.Warner Bros. I heard was suppose to do Lord of the Rings but they wanted it to be one movie instead of the three that was put out. Troy in my opinion is an indication of what the studio did to ruin a story of a classic book. Lord of the Rings was saved from being butchered since Warner Bros. did not do the films. It is unfortunate The Trojan War of the Illiad was not saved and the story ruined.
1,Why?,"Why would I want to see the director's cut to a movie that was, well, cliched and sweaty? I suppose so I could hear the director's commentary on how long Brad Pitt spent oiling up his arms so they could shine in every scene? Maybe so I can see the one character I thought three-dimensional die again. Or maybe it's so I can see the gag reel which probably features the actors laughing at their own dialogue. Either way, I'm not interested in the pre-production process that decided to dismiss the importance of the gods in this story, throw in contemporary dialogue, and (I thought this was impossible) parody ancient Greek art. Seems like a waste of time."
2,I'll stick with the books.,"Like the review said, great movie if you've never read the Illiad (or completely disregard it). But then again Hollywood always makes ""historic"" movies and then twist or completely delete certain aspects of it to fit into their vision of the film.Still... it has Brad Pitt in it. :)"
4,one hell of an epic spectacular film! will become a classic.,"MAGNIFICENT TO BEHOLD, WITH SOME REALLY FINE ACTING TO BOOT, 'TROY', despite some really negative barbs from the usual boring critics, is a real epic spectacular! wondrous to behold, breathtaking in it's vastness and scope, i along with a theatre full of people seemed extremely satisfied by mr. petersen's intrepretation (historians need not apply)! it really is awesome to see in all of it's screen wonders, some really fine performances, esp. mr. pitt, mr. bloom, and especially eric banas. it is also a joy to see the late peter o'toole and julie christie again. if you want 3 hours of eye popping visuals, some really splendid battle sequences, you will not go wrong with :TROY:. we loved it and are eagerly awaiting the dvd release tuesday, 1/4! it's an epic not to be missed. happy new year to all."
1,PUH-LEEZE.,"If you want to see Brad Pitt dance around in a leather skirt w/ waxed legs, go ahead & watch Troy. If this doesn't sound too appealing for those of you w/ a delicate constitution, skip it.As far as Orlando Bloom is concerned, he is a sniveling, overrated wimp. Helen looked like a prom queen; when I saw that blonde, pouting harlot try to act, it was extremely hard for me to believe the war was fought for her beauty.For Friday night, pick something intelligent. Not a two-hour film about a horridly debauched culture."
5,HECTOR!,this movie is awsome. one of brad pits best movies. its almost 3 hours long and there is no dull part. Keira Knightley (bend it like beckhem) was really good as helen of troy. go see it you will like it.
1,Brad Spitt is no Achilles,"Troy was a big disappointment; imagine what a real director like Peter Jackson would have made of it! Instead, we get a film that shows no respect for the story of the Trojan War; indeed, the script made so many unnecessary and unaccountable changes to the canonical story that I found myself seriously wondering if maybe the Trojans were going to win!!! The stark tragedy of the Iliad wasn't captured, and the climactic confrontation between Achilles and Priam was poorly done. They did have some really nice-looking reproductions of ancient jewelry, and the movie also puts the lie to any rumor that Brad is a real actor, but other than that..."
3,"Oh, what could have been.","This was an enjoyable, albeit flawed film. Brian Cox as Agamemnon and Eric Bana as Hector steal the show. Brad Pitt looks the part, but there was something missing from his portrayal of Achilles. Orlando Bloom as Paris was passable, but then, Paris never really was a sympathetic character to begin with. Now that the Illiad is out of the way, I'm hoping we'll get a big budget Odessey starring Sean Bean as Odysseus."
5,ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!!!!!!,THIS IS BY FAR THE GREATEST MOVIE EVER CREATED. I AM DYING TO BUY THE DVD.
1,Movie making by numbers,"OK. What do we have here? Big budget, A-list actors, cast of thousands, epic story. So far so good. But hold on what else do we have? A German director who peaked with Das Boot and then went on to make stilted, dull Hollywood movies. And that's the problem with the film. The actors needed better direction, someone who could breathe life into the epic themes, someone who could create tension within the dramatic action without relying on special effects or the spilling of blood. Unfortunately, this didn't happen here, and I became progressively more and more bored as time passed because the acting was so wooden, the lines so hackneyed, and the movie so predictable in its manipulation of the narrative and audience: cue cute baby with over sized head; cue frantic woman screaming; cue bloody fight sequence; cue sacking of ancient city. Not a movie I'd watch again; rather, a movie I rue seeing even once. Let's just hope there's no Troy 2!"
4,"""Sometimes The God's Bless You In The Morning And Curse You In The Afternoon""","I must admit that initially I didn't want to watch this movie. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan and I viewed this as just another vehicle for Brad to strike a glamorous pose or two and nothing more. Fortunately I changed my mind and gave it and chance and I'm happy I did.'Troy' released in '04 is an epic of grand proportions, brilliantly directed with a crisp script, stellar cast and memorable soundtrack. Brad Pitt was perfect for the part of Achilles as was Eric Bana as Hector. I would also like to credit Peter O'Toole for delivering one of his best performances in years as Priam, King of Troy, Diane Kruger as the lovely Helen and Sean Bean in the role of King Odysseus."
3,"Nice for Hilywood, But not History","This movie was made for Hollywood,but not for History at all. Petroculos was Achilles lover not his cousin, they left out the seen where Achilles was dressed as a women by his mother so he could be kept alive, and the fact that this war lasted 10 years, not like the movie tried to present it in 10 days. Still there were some goood points that had much accuracy. Fo example, the one line wher Brad Bit says ""Men don't make a pact with wolves,"" is very accurate. Also when Achilles dragged Hectors body. In the end this movie is very entertaining, but when looking for facts, open the book."
2,worse than pittiful king arthour,"Brad Pitt and Olando Bloom are acting way too modern in this film, especailly Brad Pitt, I would admire the way he fight in the film but things he said and that manner is simply too unrealistic in an ancient sense, i found myself hardly believe they r from ""the past"" and that destroy everything to be expecting later. My only applause is on Eric Banna he delivered a believable character. Olando's role would somewhat reminds u his role in LOTR, a kid that good with bow, but the way the story let him kill Brad at the end is so cheesy, which doesnt draw out any emotional moment whatsoever, it makes a weak ending but nothing more. Poor effort for peter wolfstang, as his neverending story is still on today one of my best movie of all time, and the war scene... weak if you r comparing it to Ridley Scott's stuffs like ""black hawk down"" or mel gibson's ""brave heart"" or ridley's new ""kingdom of the heaven""."
3,should have been better,"did anyone do an accent count?i counted 4 and not one of them was greek(pitt made up his own accent).my gripes;I AM THOROUGHLY SICK OF BLOOM!!!!!!!!!!!!HAS HE GOT SOME SICK SWASH BUCKLERS FETISH/OBSESSION OR SOMETHING?!?!?his part was fitting(a coward) but still annoying.the battle scenes were very good and the acting wasnt overly cheesy.im also tired of women playing the weeping maidens who cower in the background.there was also a line that irked me as well - young boy to achilles;''the enemy youre about to fight,i wouldnt want to.''(not verbatim). ahilles response - ''thats why no one will remember your name.''.sounds cool but theres more ways of making a name for ones self other than killing.the music was sorta goofy.all in all,its an ok movie and is not boring.i wasnt expecting much else."
4,Review for Hop on Pop,Book Review on Hop on PopThis book is called Hop on Pop and it is by Dr. Seuss. This book would be good for children ages 2-6. I think that this book is good for children who like to laugh. My mom would this book to me when I was little. It is very funny in some of the lines because people would do funny things. This book is a rhyming book. I think that the best part of the book is the illustrations. Also the characters do funny things. This book is a good book for children.
3,fair,"In contrast, the illustrations here are wild and wonderful, and the accompanying language, while simple, is delightfully silly. For example, the rhyme ""THREE TREE / Three fish in a tree / Fish in a tree? / How can that be?"" is brought to life with a trio of plump, self-satisfied fish perched atop globular branches as two stymied hybrid dog-rabbit-humanoids look on in consternation."
1,A real disappointment for any Suess fan,"This is a terrible rewrite of Hop On Pop, one of Dr. Suess' great books. They have taken some of his words, added their own, and mangled it all in an attempt to make a pop up book that sounds a bit like Hop On Pop. It doesn't work, and it doesn't seem like a lot of care was put into the rewrite.This is neither a real Dr. Suess book, nor is it a great pop-up book. Better to look elsewhere."
4,I see why it's a classic,"I see why this book is a classic. My 7 month old is not too sure about this story, but I love it! We will see what happens as she grows."
5,Love Seuss,I have read this book to both my 7 month old and 4 year old niece. Both found it amusing. Keeps their attention and keeps them giggling. Great Dr. Seuss book.
3,Wow,I do not know how so many people can condone books that promote violence against dads. I think you should probably buy your kids The Rainbow Fish or some other book that promotes good values.
4,Classic early reader,"Let's note first that this book isn't actually intended as a readaloud book, nor is it intended for children much younger than the age of six.The format of the book reflects this. It's a bit long for toddlers (who aren't known for having great attention spans), and the different spreads are disconnected - when a kid is at the age where they struggle to read ""All, Ball, We All Play Ball"", the last thing they need to worry about is what they read two pages before!Can it be used as a readaloud? No doubt! But don't be disappointed if it doesn't work for you and your kid that way.That said, this is a wonderful early reader. Simple rhyming text, with the main words in large print at the top of the page; and really funny illustrations.I really suggest this one."
5,Gabi's favorite bedtime book,"My son just turned one and this is the first book that he really listens to when I read. Before this, the only books I could get him to pay attention to were books with photos of faces, food, animals, etc. I would look through one of these types of books before nap and bed to get him to sit with me and share focus. A few weeks ago I decided to bring in some Seuss and he loves it. He starts laughing as soon as he sees the cover and jabbers with me when I start reading. It has him talking a lot more and trying to imitate the rhythm and rhyme. The first few times I read it to him I was laughing out loud as well because the little pictures and storiettes are so silly. It's great because I used to try to read him an actual story and he would get impatient. This is just the right length for a busy one-year-old."
3,Disappointed,"The book arrived with two dents in it from the shipping, I suppose. Also I ordered the book on May 2 and did not get it until June 1. This was very disappointing."
3,hop pop review,"This is a book review on Hop On Pop by Dr. SeussThis magnificent book brings back childhood memories and happiness. This book is enjoyable for ages 3-8. , Or any other person that likes Dr. Seuss. It is a quick and short book for children to read or for grandparents to read for beginning readers. It has great rhyming words and humor. Its illustrations have a lot of imagination and are even better than the Berenstein Bear books. This book to me gives me more imagination to the real world.My favorite quote's are `Walk Walk , Walk Talk ,we like to walk'.'Play Day , We Play all Day, fight flight , we fight all night"
4,Titanic Doesn't Sink,"Applause Books has published a beautiful and riveting edition of the Broadway musical ""Titanic."" In ""Titanic: The Complete Book of the Musical"" Peter Stone and Maury Yeston take us on their maiden voyage to getting the show mounted. The show endured disasterous technical difficulties in the previews and ended up shining on Tony night.I had the opportunity to see the musical in New York last year. Of course, the book has special interest to me. However, any musical theatre lover will want this book for their library.It's beautifully done with many rehearsal and production photos. And of course the entire book and lyrics of the musical are included.As the song says, ""Sail on great ship Titanic"". Happy reading"
5,Sound instructiion,This book is geared to the basics - a real find in these days of gimmics and fads in golf instruction. Sound simple swing techniques. This book works if you practice properly.
1,Follow this advice and increase your handicap!,"This is the first negative review I have written on Amazon, but I couldn't help it. This book is full of worthless drivel. There is nothing in this book that has any sound basis in science or physics. Just a bunch of one-liners such as swing the entire club or picture the shot. How many times can that stuff be written? Follow this book and waste alot of time."
5,Golf needs not be complicated,"Upon receiving this book last Friday, the day before my next game, I flicked through & read paragraphs of interest. During this 15 minutes I learnt enough to shot a score 4 shots better than my previous best and consider this to be a little unlucky. Golf is once again fun and I have no hesitation in disposing of all my other books as I have, and will continue to, read & reread this book to extract all of the subtle information."
2,Wish I'd been there,"This is probably a great show by Isaac--- too bad the audio is so tinny and high-pitched that even the most hardcore fan will turn it off after about 20 minutes. The audience seems to drown-out the action on-stage. I appreciate the age of the document, but even still... damn.It's a shame."
2,Girls gone insane,"I was alittle disappointed. I got this for my husband birthday and I was expecting it to be alittle more on the side of E wild on""""""(the cable channel)wtih fringe benefits The filming was bad and some guy was in the back ground always saying ""Let them do what they want, it's none of your busness. I thought it might have alittle bit more of a documentary style. ...."
2,MP3 Buyer Beware - lots of distortion,"The performance is great, but the digital transfer is not. Lots of distortion during loud sections of Symphony 4. If you are looking for this music in MP3 format, look elsewhere. Buyer beware!"

3,Maze,"My girl friend and I rented afew episodes at a local Blockbuster and I would say it's an Anime that you have to like. I read the reviews here and saw 5 stars ""best anime ever"" and 0 stars ""this sucks"" so I want to give a better thought. It's a really intresting show, the action is so-so but I think the plotline is great. I would say it's Ranma 1/2 meets fantasy. So if you like Ranma 1/2 Im sure you'll like this too, else go rent it or something and see if you'll like it first."
3,"works, but treat it carefully","I bought 3 of these... one I ended up twisting as I pushed the computer back on the rack; and it stopped working -- the wires are not secure, so they can rotate -- apparently, something rotated and broke ""inside"" -- the other two I put a drop of crazy glue to help keep them from rotating."
3,Vee don't need no stinkin editor,This is just a bit too complete and needs to be viewed with a thumb on the fast-forward button. The sign-on and sign-off segments (same for every show) were not edited out. They're cute once.
1,BUYER BEWARE OF SNYDERS WEBBOOKS,"BUYERS BEWARE OF SNYDERS WEBBOOK IN INDEPENDENCE, MO I PAID $18 FOR A USED BOOK WHEN SNYDERS WEBBOOKS SAID IT WAS BRAND NEW! I AM RETURNING THE BOOK I HOPE THEY RETURN MY MONEY. PAGES WERE ALL BROWN"
4,Good read,"Mary's book was just like I expected, witty, intelligent and caring. I can almost hear her Italian accent while I'm reading. It was a good story, not much for ""how to"" but some good advice and her personal story and strength reminds me that there are those that have it much worse than me. Sometimes I need that reminder. Gratitude is another lesson I took from the book, an essential aid for healing.All in all, Mary's book was wonderful, I enjoyed it and learned some lessons."
3,a little heavy,"I wanted more humor. This is actually a dictionary and hits boring as well as interesting terms. Perhaps a must have for Poli Sci Majors, Colbert Report Listeners and American History Nappers."
2,2 Basic 4 Me,This was a high level review of the strategies. No trading examples were given. If you have already read a couple books on hedge funds this one is not for you.
5,W.C. Field's best and most original comedy.,"Long before the age of ""South Park"" or even ""Monty Python,"" Fields was breaking the rules of comedy. This film is not only very funny, but oddly surreal. The great comedian sets everything in a small town that is somewhere Fields could have only created. All the kids are brats, all the women are shrews, and Fields' character is kind of a moron. This film works because he is able to have a hateful attitude towards everything and everyone without losing a sense of humor towards his own drunken persona. It is just completely brillant. It's better than having a ""beer river flowing over your grandmother's shawl."""
2,Unfunny and overrated,"The Bottom Line:I walked into The Bank Dick knowing little about W.C. Fields and walked out very unimpressed by his style of comedy: the film wanders freely from one boring setup to another, never finding much comic material or presenting any sort of clothesline to string gags on, leaving the audience with little to do but listen to lines that might be funny if written but sure aren't when Fields mutters them droningly.2/4"
5,"Pure ""cool""...","""The Sidewinder""... 10 minutes 24 seconds of pure ""cool"" and a stunningly effective example of how to push jazz into mainstream popular music without compromising on technique or virtuosity. Recorded in 1963 - way before ""jazz/funk"" was invented - Lee Morgan lays down its perfect template by creating an insidious riff that captures & holds the listener's attention while inviting improvisation from a superbly tight band that includes Joe Henderson on sax and the wonderful Bob Cranshaw on bass. So clever that their breaks become an integral part of the driving back-beat that results in that rarest of things: a jazz track that you can actually dance to. Definitive, timeless and, above all, fun.And the rest?... high quality early 60's jazz: as good as anything around at the time but overwhelmed by the sheer power of this album's opening track."
4,Seminal serpent,"I never cared for the title track when I first heard it, regarding it as little more than a boogaloo period piece. But after listening to numerous attempts to copy the formula (and repeat its commercial success), it's easier to understand the attention the original has received. Morgan and his cast of players seem to understand that it's all about the ""groove,"" and his conservative, underplayed solo, always staying inside the rhythmic pocket, insures that this sidewinder never goes off course. Its only rival among all the Sidewinder wannabes is probably Kenny Dorham's ""Una Mas.""Regarding editions, I've heard both the RVG remaster and the 1990 transfer, and prefer the earlier edition. The boosting of bass and treble frequencies, perhaps impressive to some ears, contributes little to the serpent's sinuous and seductive path."
3,"Entertaining, but not as good as others","I've found every book in this series to be funny, entertaining, and an enjoyable read. That said, if I had to rank this book compared to the others in the series, I'd have to put it on the low end. Pratchett generally keeps the stories fresh by cycling between his large cast of Discworld characters from one book to the next, but this book had too much of a ""been there, done that"" feel to it."
5,Great,"Simply one of the best books I've ever read. A mystery, a comedy, a drama, and sci-fi all rolled into one. Pratchett out did himself with this one. Fantasy can often take itself too seriously (or not seriously enough). This book doesn't even bother except in regards to storyline which stays compeling throughout every page.Pratchett is a craftman, not just a writer."
2,music in the elevator on the way to a broadway play about li,Gimmie some blues. This is not the best blues album ever made.Little charlie's guitar is good but does not sizzle. Rick Estrins vocals are smooth and slick like that crazy pompedor he sports.Dobie Strange on drums - my girlfriend likes his name and I'm sure dobie would like my girlfriend- is great. Ronnie James Weber on bass makes the album. It's whitebread and processed cheese blues.It's the blues you'll gladly lend to a friend.If andrew lyodd webber made a play about Charlie Paxtonthis is the sound you would hear on the elevator to the balcony.
4,good replacement for home owner power washer,"I bought this pump last year to replace the one that failed on my 8hp Generiac pressure washer. This pump is not ceramic like the original, but has already lasted longer than the original unit. It bolted on just fine, I had to get an adapter for one of the fittings, but no big deal. This unit has been a good replacement for a power washer that is used by the neighborhood for washing their house before painting. I don't know if it would hold up for professional, but for us it has been fine. 3 houses done, and it is still working. To powerfull for washing cars though, it took the paint right off my montero bumper, and the labels off my fiberglass ladders."
1,Don't buy from this company,"I ordered this map in November 2006, it is now July 20, 2007 and I have yet to receive my order that I paid for. I have notified the company with little or no response. There wasen't an option below a 1 star for the rating, otherwise I would have rated it a 0-."
1,Useless book,"This workbook is of no value to the student. The exercises could easily have been assigned by the instructor, but better yet would be for the instructor to develop his/her own. The author should be honest and re-title the book a ""Busywork book"" because that's all it is."
5,Good read!,Seldom does even a good book warrant reading more than once. This one is even better the second time around. I haven't enjoyed the search for symbolism so much since my college days.
4,"CJ Chenier, Too Much Fun","What is there to say? CJ Chenier is great. If you like this, then you should also like Buckwheat Zydeco."
1,The price can't be justified,"iPOD accessories are notoriously overpriced. $100 for a tiny pair of made in china travel speakers. $100 for a iPod brand leather case. $300 for a complete docking station, ect...This product falls in that category.Instead of purchasing a $50 FM transmitter, you can spend $10 and get a casette adapter instead. You won't have to deal with reception issues, privacy, it's much more simple, and it wont use up extra battery power like the FM transmitter does.It's something better for a fraction of the price, it's a no brainer."
5,Moanin' has got me smilin' again . . .,"""Moanin'"" has an essential part of any jazz collection (or music collection, for that matter). The boisterousness of this lp is best reflected in the title track. The beauty of this lp is best reflected in the exquisite ""Along Came Betty."" I could write superlatives about it all day, but I could never do it justice. Please try it, and I guarantee that your love of jazz will only deepen. And if you don't love jazz, you will after hearing this record."
5,you know it when you get there,"i like this lp a lot. it is very rich of musical idea and deep on synphonical depth. it is easy listening and entertaining, and you wil aknowledge that this is done by people who know what they are doing at heart. and therefore go out and buy it at a real record store (yes the small ones!). it is hand made, it should be sold by hand, and if you do so, you get that time and jazz a little closer... from the heart, done by hand, handed from one to antoher... now you dig it..."
4,Lots of Fun,This is a great blues band and these songs were most of the best of the songs they played in the concert I attended. They can be a bit rauncy at times but the music is great and the lyrics can make you laugh out loud.
5,A great collection of their hits,"This set of titles is one of the best they have put out. These women can say things that few people can pull off. If you ever get a chance to see them live, do it, I see them at least twice a year."
4,Singin' Around,Great light jazz standards sang by Diane Linscott performed with three different jazz trios and the last song with a guitar only.Song tracks1.What A Wonderful World/ It's A Wonderful World2.Crazy He Calls Me3.Close Enough For Love4.Am I Blue5.Old Devil Moon6.Lush Life7.S'Wonderful8.You Turned The Tables On Me9.All The Things You Are10.Then You've Never Been Blue11.I Get A Kick Out Of You12.You Don't Know What Love Is13.My Blue Heaven14.My Shining Hour
3,Pretty on the eyes,"I found this dance/exercise video difficult to follow. Although the back ground participants were able to be in step with Lisa, I was often seeking her beat..... I had my own which is steady."
1,Horrible!,"I am SHOCKED that anybody enjoys or uses this video. It's insanely boring, Lisa is lost half of the time, and you can barely hear the music. Perhaps it serves a purpose of teaching very basic dance steps, but it's laughable as a workout video. The fast version of each dance lasts 90 seconds. That's a whopping six minutes of cardio. And if you want to skip the tutorials and just get to work, you'll have to use the menu again and again. Horrible. Really, I can't believe how bad it is. Do not waste your money!"
2,Excellent features but electrical malfunction,"This is the ideal mouse for a laptop on the go. It iis lightweight and precise although a little too hungry for battery power. Its biggest problem, though, is that it works intermittentyly; often the electrical circuit seems to be interrupted and the mouse stops working. Fiddling with it will eventually restore the connection but this is not the way a mouse is supposed to behave.If I knew that mine is a defective unit I would replace it with another Targus BT but I can't be sure of it; it may be a design problem. Too badbecause it is an otherwise excellent product."
4,"Great features, but the mouse itself...ehhh","This mouse works great, once you figure out the trick to setting it up and pairing it with the computer. The bluetooth feature is also nice, however I find myself excessively using the ""Sync"" feature with Microsoft Outlook, compusively adding tasks to the calendar, just because I know with a click of a button, they can also be added to my phone. As a college student, I feel I'm a little TOO organized because of the features this mouse comes along with. Overall, the technology works great, the mouse is responsive (maybe a little too sensitive, but nothing you can't tweak), and the bluetooth adapter/wireless mouse bundle saves you a bunch of money in the long run.The only thing I dont like about this whole package is that I feel Targus had complete disregard for what every computer user would feel is ""comforatable"" when holding a mouse. On a 1-10 scale, I give the whole package an 8, but the mouse separately would have to be a 4."
3,Cute Story but took forever!,This was a cute story and ended well. It just seemed like it took the whole book for the characters to get their crap together.

2,Tripplite aptly named,"All this does for us is periodically show a red light and turn everything off. We have 6 items plugged in. It started doing this within a few days of use.Yes, we have an old house and our wiring is not modern 200+ amp service (it's 100 amp), but this is useless to provide any reliable battery backup.Think twice if your house is not new or newly rewired."
1,Unreliable,"Shortly after buying this product it went into overload alarm so I reduced the load accordingly connecting only my Imac and Router. On several occasiongs my Imac has shut down unexpectedly which I have now confirmed as failure of the UPS, the UPS did not switch to Battery first.I have since bought a replacement UPS and have had no further problems."
4,Research in Education,The book arrived in record time. I was very pleased with the condition of the book. There was one problem with book. The book contained a password to links on the web. This password had expired and I had a hard time obtaining a new one.
5,Majestic,"My few acquaintances with Denes Varjon on CD have been uniformly positive. This is a highly engaging Schumann recital. The Fantasie features a full-bodied tone and sensible tempos. None of the big moments are overdone, as they are in so many performances. There is a mastery here of phrasing and inflection that is highly winning. I can't think of a recording of the Fantasie that I've enjoyed more. I am much less familiar with the other pieces, but they seem to be well characterized and richly hued. Denes Varjon strikes me as an excellent artist deserving of a truly international career. He just never seems to have had the big push. Naxos's sound is very good, with just a little tinniness occasionally to the piano tone."
4,Great Way to End the Trilogy,"This is the third movie in the series of the 36th Chamber of Shaolin Series.Now Instead of Gordon Liu being the lead,Hsiao Ho is the Main character.He plays legendary hero Fong Sai Yuk of Fong Shi Yu which has been played by many famous actors like Jet Li,Alexander Fu Sheng,Meng Fei,Willie Chi Tin Sang.The movie is once again directed by Lau Kar Leung and it has many famous actors like Venom's Sun Chien,Jason Piao,Lee Hoi San I wont include the plot but trust me if its distributed by Dragon Dynasty you better believe you are watching a classic this movie was made after 8 diagram Pole fighter.if you like the legendary hero Fong sai yuk check out other movies that are about himYoung Hero of Shaolin 1&2Secret of shaolin polesProdigal Boxer 1&2Burning ParadiseSHaolin Temple (Chang Cheh)Fong Sai Yuk with Jet Li 1&2"
2,Game starts out strong and then becomes stupid,"Very cool graphics and all that.However, it falls victim to the same thing EVERY single RTS I have ever seen does: the creators start making the game insanely difficult to the point of you either buy their Game Strategy Guide (cha-ching), find some cheat codes, or give up on the game.*sigh* I had some high hopes but alas... typical RTS game."
3,the best beatles sax book ever except that you have to transpose it,This book is great if your playing for your own enjoyment. if you want to play it for a solo you will have to transpose it into the origanal key. if you dont it shall sound weird when you play it to the track. so you should buy this for a teen between 13 and 14 who enjoys playing there sax or flute. i enjoy it greatly. but i am a 13 year old.source:me
2,Wrong back! DID NOT FIT!,"Seems Razr made 2 typs of backs. it was low cost enough but in the end it was wrong. I believe the confusion could have been avoided if the description a statement addressing the possibilities of ""Wrong fit"" could have avoided me waisting my time and $3 bucks or what ever I paid for it."
2,Treats and Causes Depression?,"Probly bought this when I was depressed. Now I was feelin fine, until I got this in the mail, opened it, and listened to it. Had to turn it off. It's chill, but depressing."
5,STONE IN MY SHOE,"THIS ALBUM IS HARD TO BEAT. THIS IS RIGHT UP THERE WITH ""BEST OF ROCKERS N"" BALLADS & ""LOVE AT FIRST STING"". THEIR GUITAR RIFFS ARE AMAZING AND THE VOCALS ARE PERFECT AS USUAL. THIS IS A MUST TO HAVE FOR EVERY SCORPIONS FAN"
4,Best retro album in comparison to some other bands,"Megadeth did good retro with return to hangar, but some of the other retro Megadeth is not so great. I can honestly listen to scorpions Pure Instinct right along with In Trance and feel there is a sameness there. The rest of the album is nothing like eye to eye, or face the heat or crazy world or savage,sting, blackout,love drive,magnet,killer,force,fly,crow. just listen to those two, trance and instinct. We don't need any more sting; I personally think hurricane is one of their worst songs."
3,Softer side of Scorpions,"While Pure Instinct was the flipside of Face the Heat and comprised mostly of ballads or mid-tempo rock songs, it still has the Scorpions sound to it. Songs like ""Wild Child"" and ""Oh Girl"" and ""Stone In My Shoe"" are strong rockers, similar to previous Scorpions songs like ""Crazy World"" or ""We Let It Rock...You Let It Roll"".However, ""Does Anyone Know"" sounds like yet another attempt to recreate their hit song ""Wind of Change"". While the songs are good, the lack of hard rock on this album doesn't make it one of my favorite albums.For the true Scorpions fan this album is a must, but for those who haven't heard them, this isn't the appropriate album to start with. For the beginning Scorpions listener, Crazy World or Love At First Sting would be better albums to signify Scorpions and their music."
5,Lil'Ed continuous good job!,"Really a great blues band,with few members and great feelings! Alligator is an iluminated seal,with many great surprises to the bluesfans all over the world.Iglauer,thanks a lot!"
2,"I hate to say it, but ...","... bought this not knowing Nina Gordon had left; popped it into the CD changer, and wondered -- where are the hooks? why is none of this catchy? what's wrong with the vocals? But now... I understand why. Sad. Eight Arms to Hold You was fun, had a sense of irony about the monster rock elements (complete with cowbells). This feels like Eight Arms without the irony. Wish I had bought Juliana Hatfield or Sleater-Kinney's latest instead of this one."
1,It sits on my shelf . . .,"Horrible attempt to resusitate a dead Veruca, which is missing the real talent of the group, Nina Gordon. Sorry Louise, you ain't getting it done. Don't waste your cash, not even on a used cheapie. You're warned."
5,Genius like this is a dying breed,"Just a great, classic album that gets better every time you hear it. And I have been listing to it for years, so I know what I am talking about. Pure genius. The kind that the world is coming to appreciate less and less, it seems, as we tread down the path of being Morlocks."
3,"brooding, intensely personal","If pain is the ultimate fuel for writing, then consider this a gas station waiting to explode.This album is not so bad. At first I was disappointed by it, because it lacked the lighter side and zest that Nina Gordon tainted their songs with. But this also showcases Post's relatively good lyrical ability, and makes her human, vulnerable and wretched, unlike the Seether image I have on her. This stuff may be good on stereo when you feel like ranting. But as Post would sing, this album is so intensely personal that it ""is kinda scary."""
3,"Solid VS, but missing Nina","In earlier outings, Louise Post's songs (""Celebrate You;"" ""All hail me,"" etc.) were always the moodiest on VS albums, so I was worried that ""Resolver"" might not rock. I was wrong. I really enjoy ""Born Entertainer"" for its quirkiness and ""Yeah Man"" for its layered vocals. ""Hellraiser"" is vintage Louise. That said, I do miss Nina's contribution -- especially because although her lyrics were never as soulful as Louise's, her ability to write hooks that worked and her strong voice were perfect compliments to Louise's talents. I agree with a previous reviewer who noted that the album seems a bit ""lonely,"" and as someone who has been in and out of a collaborative relationship for 15 years, I would counsel Louise and Nina to try again -- their voices and playing complimented each other."
5,Durango Street,"This book is really good. At first it seems really boring and kind of a gangster book, but later on its really interesting. You see the character's personality change. You also find out how life is very hard in the gangster world because you have no where that is safe. The main character Rufus Henry, is the source that changes the group called Moors. It is an exicting novel that shows the rivalry between the different rival groups. (Moors, Gassers, Bloods etc.) If you pick up the book and it seems boring in the beginning, i advise you to continue reading it. The book in the middle is totally awesome. Don't let this oppurtunity to read a good book slip by. Frank Bonham is an excellent author. READ THIS BOOK!Jennifer Wong"
3,Show iis very cool but video is very low quality,"It is very high quality concert and Ricky did the best, but concert video is so compressed that I see the cubics instead of flat picture during the show at my HD TV."
3,Kinda blah and boring,"I hate to say it, but this recording is just kind of blah and boring as far as I'm concerned. At this point in jazz, melody was being discarded in favor of modal scales. Soloist just noodled over the changes. Most everything on this CD is downbeat, introspective, somewhat tentative. I've got a few hundred jazz CDs and love the music, but starting with Wayne Shorter, things just got ... boring. If you want something timeless, get Soul Station by Hank Mobley.Soul Station"
3,I dont know what to say,"On one hand, The Corrs have made a smart move with this album. They've gone back to their celtic roots and have made an album that is more folk and celtic than pop. Which is fine.But on the other hand, the songs can be quite depressing, both lyrically as well as musically. Especially songs like 'Heart Like A Wheel', 'Moorlough Shore' and 'Peggy Gordon'.I love The Corrs. They are my one of my favourite bands. But i was quite disappointed with this album. I dont see myself listening to it all the time like i listen to 'Talk on Corners', 'In Blue' and 'Borrowed Heaven'.All in all, The Corrs can do much better. This album is good, and has some nice tracks like 'Old Town', 'My Lagan Love' and 'Haste To The Wedding' (which was already on 'In Blue' as a bonus track) but the rest of the album is just not as good as their previous albums. Still, It's worth a listen."
3,Hard to follow due to camera angles.,"I had a hard time following a few dances because the camera seemed to move from feet to torso when she was moving the opposite demonstrations (ie, showing her face when she was doing footwork or showing her feet when she was doing arm work)"
3,"Many Area Not Covered, such as network area.","I bought this book for the exam, and it helped, but not fully covered. For the system admin part, it is good. But for the network part, it is not good. I read the book twice in network part, and it is not very helpful. I faild the exam first time, as the network part was too low, though I scored pass totallly. Then I read it the second, and took the exam after three days. I merely passed the network part, but I do not feel this book is helpful. Some topics are not covered very well in network, such as DHCP, and Subnetting, where I could not find the answers for the exam."
4,Searching for Smile,"This book reads like a chronological scrap-book that highlights the infamous ""Smile"" album that was never released in 1967. This is not a cohesive book but rather a collection of articles and insights from the era. What is interesting is tracing the history of the rise and fall of the ""Smile"" album from the promise of ""Good Vibrations"" from the ""Pet Sounds"" era to downfall of ""Smile"" itself. The true fan has already pieced their own ""Smile"" together and yes you can find it if you know where to look although what we have is not what Brain intended in 1967. Well, one day hopefully a book will be written on the whole ""Smile"" era but this one is a nice collection and will not disappoint the fans. After all isn't what's so great about the album is that it was never released? Enjoy the mystery of ""Smile"" and you too will be hooked. Do you dig worms?"
3,Does this soundtrack have the melody?,Does the soundtrack contain the instrumental song/melody also? I forget what part in the movie it is but it quite good...
1,Cover or Remake is just a Copy !,"I didn't like this sountrack at all, I mean I know that sometimes in the music industry, singers usually remake older songs, but Is NOT fair! Why Sara Paxton just copy ""Quererte"" from the Mexican band RBD?? Doesn't she or her producer have enough imagination to write a good new song. NO MORE ""REMAKES"""
4,Great Song,"In 1995, the Beatles began working on their ""Anthology"" project, and I believe this CD serves as a good preview to the set. You get the newly recorded song, ""Real Love,"" and outtakes plus a live version of ""Baby's in Black"" from the 1965 Hollywood Bowl concert (which, I might add, was not released on the 1977 Hollywood Bowl record, so it is truly unreleased.) I now own this single on CD and vinyl, just because I love the Beatles. ""Real Love"" is one of John's best songs ever."
4,good for many ages,This is great for ideas to do experiments with your kids. There are easy and harder experiments (you can do part of the set up for younger children and let older children do it all). I do wish there was a little more explanation of some the background science specifics. This copy was in great shape even though it says good it looks great with minimal wear.
4,My Granddaughter had to have it,"My 5 years old granddaughter had seen this book at a local library one day and wanted to keep it. When we told her that she could take it home for a few days but would have to return it, she cried and cied. When I told her I would order the book and get it for her, she was happy. I immediately went on line to Amazon and found it in soft cover, which I liked better than the hard cover. And sure enough within a few days she had her book and is happy! Thanks to Amazons fantastic fast services, I was able to make my little granddaughter happy."
4,Amazon description is incorrect,"I own a Planet Ocean chronometer/chronograph and it is outstanding. The watch shown here for sale is a chronometer but not a chronograph as referred to in the Amazon product description. A significant error as a chronograph and chronometer is significantly more complicated and expensive. That being said, this is still a great watch and a great and accurate movement."
5,A charming book,"This is a favorite book of my two year old daughter. We read it every day along with Fish Wish by Bob Barner. I believe that these two books have given my daughter a real appreciation of the ocean. We love following the little girls adventure as she takes a trip the beach. As we read the book my daughter and I go along with the motions of the little girl in the story. As the girl listens to the ocean in a shell, we pretend to listen also. When she touches the sea we wriggle our toes as well. When she smells the sea we sniff too. This truly an interactive book. My daughter loves naming all of the sea creatures in this book, the dolphin, starfish, jellyfish, etc. It is simple enough for a two year old to follow and the pictures are sweet. Our favorite picture is at the end of the book where the little girl asks if the sea dreams of her. This book is a joy to read with your child."
5,loved this book!!!,I thought this book was charming and funny. The illustrator uses large images to capture the feeling of being at the beach. The little girl in the story is adorable and real. A slight mishap dampens her initial enthusiasm for the beach and she becomes cranky and wants to go home. She does think back on her visit fondly and her dreams are full of the sights and sounds that so enchanted her during her visit.
3,A matter of presonal preference,"I didn't really enjoy this CD, however, it is only a matter of personal preference. I know of others who give it high marks. Just didn't hit a chord with me. You'd probably like it!"
2,Too Thick,"This is too thick for insertion for my partner so it is unusable, it is a nice material, however, so if you like it nice and thick and long, it is a good product for you."
2,Not fully developed,I thought it had the makings of a Harlequin romance. It seemed to follow an outline. The characters weren't fully developed and with St Lucia as the setting the descriptions were not beautiful as I would have expected.It was shallow and contrived. Easy to read but not much depth.
5,"Ricky, I want to be in the show!","Well worth the price... I have a 1940`s crome table, Now it is complete.The lucy chairs are very sturdy all around . I love them and I know they will last. I hope they will continue to sell them, I want two more when I get back to the states to bad they don`t ship to APO addresses."
5,ONE OF MY ALLTIME FAVORITE BOOKS.,Don't waste time reading the reviews on this book. If you have come this far you are supposed to read it.Mind Bomb
1,DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,"This book promise so much by the wide coverage of topics in Organic lab. but it delivers nothing. Aside from listing the topics in the Table of content. The seemingly knowledable Prof. Zubric presents an unorganize, incomprehensible 294 pages of something that read like a page from a low budget Comic Strip. Am shock that a well respected publishing house like John Wiley and Son would lend their reputation to a low quality like this. The author talked about every thing that are irrelevant. what is needed is a good intro. to the subject like -EXTRACTION and then the stepwise layout of professional quality discussion of headings like - Materials involved; procedure; observation; conclusion etc. he fail to approach the subject prof. The book would pass for a Book of Short Jokes. Do not waste your money. D BOOK DID NOT HELP ME IN MY CLASS ANYWAY..."
4,heater review,This was a replacement for a much earlier model. Installation was less than 20 minutes. Somewhat smaller than my older model but will heat bathroom area sufficiently. One other bathroom has an older model and would purchase this model as a replacement when necessary.
2,Must use with timer!,"This heater is great...it really cranks out the heat. I live in an older house, and replaced the Broan model 158. However, I've learned the hard way that the thermal switch on this unit is not reliable. Once the unit turns itself off via the thermal switch, it won't come back on. I've went through three thermal units before I learned my lesson. With the 158 the thermal switch would reset itself and I would be able to use the unit again. So if you really want this unit, buy a timer switch to go with it.If I had to do it over again, I wish I would have gone with another 158. It worked fine on the old fashioned toggle switch."
4,Broan Bathroom Heater,This was a replacement for the bathroom heater that was installed in 1975!! My wife loves the extra heat provided each morning. Very good value.
4,Hard to remove from packaging!,"My grandson loved the castle, knights and figures but it took 3 adults and a seven year old to over 1/2 hour to remove all the various fasteners holding the items in place in the box. There must be a better way for manufacturers to secure items. He had originally asked for Papo figurines but was delighted by this set. ""Sweet"" was his evaluation."
2,"Barely mediocre, sorry to say....","Well, I ordered this CD fully hoping to love it... I read about it, and thought that the bits of lyrics I read sounded quite lovely. Well, I will still give him that - some of his lyrics are pretty profound and interesting, but the sound...it's just not very listener-friendly. Everything sounds jangled and unplanned, unpredictable (and not in a good way), uncoordinated. It sounds sloppy and lacks a solid sense of rhythm. None of the songs really even have attempts at hooks. His voice is lacking in quality, which would be ok if he made up for it with emotion, but he does not. I'm just struggling to find a ""feel"" for this album, because it just sounds more like musical noise aspiring to be something beautiful, and...well, failing. Sorry...would have loved to be more positive!"
1,"Wow, disappointed...","Never thought I'd give one star to this product. I do like Faber-Castell, I'm an artist and have many products of this brand.This set was a total disappointment. If you ever had 'real' German Faber-Castell items you'll understand what I mean. It's made in Korea not in Germany. It smells bad, the package quality is poor, the pastel quality is poor... urghI know it's all about the price and it's a good value for this money... but when I buy Faber-Castell I expect the famous German quality."
5,"Versatile, wonderful","We've been enjoying hot sauces for years and have been Scorned Woman (original) devotees since the bottles came in little black velvet pouches. We think the original sauce goes best with: 1-seafood, 2-chicken, then its usefulness drops off fast. For our tastes, at least. But not so with Sweet Magic. While not as hot as the original, and not hot enough for us, it is very versatile and complements the rest of foods that the original doesn't. It has quickly become our staple hot sauce. We recommend it highly, although we wish it were hotter.I should add that we're very picky - perhaps our all-time favorite hot sauce was Henry's Hot Sauce, made by a small restaurant in Asheville, NC several years ago. Hickory smoked habaneros was one of the reasons it was so good. Too bad they don't make it anymore."
1,Something That Fell Out Of The 80's,"This phone would be great if it was 1980. The size of this beast is huge. Actually it is even bigger than my cordless house phone. It does not come with any type of holster or carrying device. I guess they felt the extra 50 pounds for a holster might be a turn off. The buttons are very hard to push and way to small considering the size of this grandfather clock of a phone and very hard on the fingers. The menus are sub tree devided. To get to a feature, you have to go through a maze and hope you find what you are looking for. It comes with 4 'getting started' manuals but each one tells you nothing other than to check back to page 28 for more details, only to go to page 28 and read that you will learn about this feature on page 70? I would not recommend this peice of crap to anyone. It has a true Fisher Price design but it weighs much more than a child could possibly carry."
3,Alright Phone,"With a battery life of nearly 4 hours of talk time, the i305 is a very affordable phone. Including features as One Touch Direct Connect, and downloadable ring tones, the i305 is a sure bet. Create up to 600 contacts in your phone book, and never lose you way with this GPS enabled purchase. But had ordered it off of Nextels site. They even gave me a code that saved me $50.00. Here it is for you all to share (CL897L) case sensitive. On the shopping cart page. It is like an invoice thing. But I think it is a very good choice. You will enjoy the phone."
4,Loved the book.,Thank you so much for a book that felt like it was written from the heart and included Christian values. This will not be the only one I will read and cannot wait to start a new book.
4,CWBk 1,I enjoyed the story. As a teacher the relationship with county children and families bought back wonderful memories. A great uplifting red.look forward to bk2
4,Good heart lifting read,Enjoyed it . not sure why amazon requires a word limit for reviews. but i would read more of theseries
3,"Nice story, o.k. characters","I read this book a few weeks ago, and it was the first time in over a decade that I had read anything by Ms. Oke. I pretty much feel the same about her writing style as I did back then - she has some nice, heart-warming story lines, great settings, and somewhat interesting plots (if a little bit predictable)... however, her characters tend to be a little shallow. Her Christian characters (which are most of them) always seem too perfect in my opinion - they never seem to struggle with things, and when they do, they get over their struggles and issues very quickly. This doesn't seem to mirror what a majority of real people experience, so I would like to see more character development. I have read books by many other Christian authors, and many of them excel at creating believable characters."
4,Good reading,"Keeps you wanting to know what's going to happen. Life is full of surprises, you never know what will take you where."
2,omg I think I read this before in another series she wrote,"Woman is smart don't mess with a winning formula. I think the series this just pretty much deja vues was the book with the 'seasons of the heart' series...all that was left was a horse to break a leg in this series and the other series to have a adorable kid that ends up dead and poof nearly there.Its a good book, don't get me wrong, and I did like it, but its formulamatic. She's a wise author don't mess with what works. Its a christian novel so its not like its going to be a surprise every book with christian overtones is pretty much the same no matter who writes it."
3,Okay read...,"Hope there's more in the next book(s), took a long time to get to the good stuff. Stretched out a little."
5,Heart-racing read,"For anyone who enjoys a good frontier romance with a strong sense of faith in God, this is a great book to read. The story draws you close enough to the characters that you find yourself laughing and crying with them. A word of warning, be ready to find book 2 as Janette Oke leaves you eager for more."
2,Review,Too much non contributory information. It got long and boring in places and I found myself reading just to fulfill my commitment. Very surprised at Janette Oak.
2,A story of...,"Want a slice of history out of context? If so read this. It should be labeled ""Caution read only at night"" and also ""No operating heavy machinery while reading this book""."
4,Vewry inspiring,"I have never been much for reading books with female authors, but thought I woul;d try this one out, and I must admit, from the very beginning she captured my interest, and through the entire book, I was uplifted and encourage in my spiritual faith. I recommend this book"
3,It was ok,"I love the fact that this is a clean book with Christian elements. Jeanette Oke is a wonderful writer and I commend her for her talent. However, she spends a great deal of the book describing the countryside, the train rides, the food, the coyotes, etc. and I'm more interested in interactions with people and their dialogue. I wish the romance would have developed further. It took a long time for Elizabeth and Wynn to figure things out and then suddenly they are engaged and the story ends. I guess that's why this is in a series. It was not a bad book. I just prefer a different style of writing."
4,good book,Another good book written by Janette oke. I always liked this story and her love comes softly series. Great canadian west story!
5,when the heart calls,"Read was fantastic,enjoyed the strength of the characters,both Male and Female leads did not give in to the pressures,they stood up and fought for what they believed in,so much for conventions."
5,Great book!,"Ms. Oke takes us places in her writings that many do not see. In both the American ""old west"" and the Canadian West, Oke shows us a side of settlement that we don't normally see in television or traditional ""old west"" books. Settlement in Canada and settlement in the United States was approached differently and had different consequences. Oke gently reminds us of the historical setting of her books and her characters are never ""preachy."" Great book!"
2,Deleted Early,"I tried to settle into this book but soon realized that it just wasn't my style. For me, it was just too flowery and old fashioned."
5,"clean, pure, real","Clean, pure, real. That describes the people in this book and the romance that is in it. It is so PURE and santified--what a change from society today!"
1,So Sad,I'm a little disappointed that there isn't much stuffing in the pillow part I had to open mine up and add some
2,"Don't bother, it's not worth buying.","I don't understand all the hype about this pillow. My chiropractor recommended it. I sleep on my back and my side. It's okay for a side sleeper, but not for a back sleeper. The picture shown is a cut out view of the pillow. The top of the pillow is a thick and made of simple polyfill material. The water in the bottom of the pillow is nothing more then a gimick as far as I'm concerned. It does nothing to enhanse the pillow whatsoever. It's a waste of your money. The pillow is so thick with or without the water, it's just uncomfortable to sleep on. If you're on your side it's okay, but not worth throwing your money away for. Don't bother buying the pillowcase that doesn't come with it. That's a waste of $20. It's a mildly quilted and nothing more. Just use your own pillowcase from home. After a week of using it, I went back to my feather pillow. At least with that pillow, I can adjust it to my liking."
5,Love this sauce,The first time I had this sauce was when I was stationed in Puerto Rico. I liked it so much that I went back to the Post Exchange to buy more but they had sold out. This was about 10 years ago. I never forgot it and decided to look it up online last year and found it here on Amazon. I ordered 3 or 4 bottles. It seems they may have changed the recipe a tad as the sauce has a vinegary taste/smell that comes out or I just never noticed it but it didn't change my thoughts on this sauce. It has a great flavor and nice spice to it. I use it on all foods. Try a drop or two on top of your hard boiled egg instead of salt...the vinegar taste works great with eggs (if you like pickled eggs). Don't let me deter anyone from it because of the vinegar taste...it is still an awesome sauce. About to order some and have it shipped here to Afghanistan if I can. Try it out.
1,LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW!,Don't you dare buy this butchered remake! Get the original by Don McLean. Believe me- it's worth it!
3,Its O-kay but...,"I would wait to get this single. The Victor Calderone Vocal/Extended Club remixes are like the Dub verison to the vocal mixes. and the song [Madonna's Vocals] is the middle of the song and it just cuts in with Madonna saying ""Did You write the book of love..."" the up side to these remixes is that they are only Madonna Vocals. So if I you, I would wait."
3,Pretty good...,"Madonna's version of American Pie can be labelled boring, but the two dance versions on here at least offer some variety. The extended remix is a mind-numbing trance offering, good for a club. Definitely not her best dance work, but far from the worst."
5,Excellent!,"Madonna's version of American Pie is a true classic - better than the original (if that was ever possible) and Don Mclean should consider it an honor. The dance mix of it is even better -- an excellent update -- catchy and a ""must own""."
2,Not a very good cover,"1. American Pie (Victor Calderone Vocal Club Mix) - this mix is horrible, it just goes on and on untill the real vocals finally come in, and it dosn't last long. Bleh.2. American Pie (Victor Calderone Extended Vocal Club) - when I thought it couldn't get even worse, this longer version proved me wrong! This mix is practically the same and it's tacky and endless.3. American Pie (Richard ""Humpty"" Vission Visits Madonna) - not a real mix, lots of repetition in this one. Its okay, not good, but half-decent4. American Pie (Richard ""Humpty"" Vission Radio Mix) - VERY GOOD! There is no endless waiting for the vocals, it starts quick and sounds great. I love this one!5. American Pie (Album Version) - The music dosn't go very well with the vocals, I'll have to pass on this one. Just not very good.If you were to get this single, the only reason is for track #4. All of the others are horrible. Possibly her worst single to date."
1,Save your money and buy authentic throat singers from Tuva,Awful 'plastic shaman' new age-y noise. Richard Feyman must be rolling in his grave.
4,very good,"Very Informative Book. The information is not in detailed I would liked, or the information is to brief. Not enough troubleshooting Guideline. But You can get a decent amount of some informative and repair direction from this book. WORTHY BUY BOOK!! CAN'T BEAT THE PRICE!! USEFULL!!"
3,Not Suprise,"The plot of this movie is just not in the least surprising from where I see. It is my believe that the most religious you are the more corruptive. Being in a position of power and simultaneously bieing admired, and thrusting is a scary conbination for powerful religious leaders. On the other hand, love Gael Garcia Bernal's performance!"
3,"Tragic drama, but I could not see the point","I will be brief: actors were all great, the female character was simply sweet in her roll. The tragedy was touching. There was a nice touch of magic realism.Eternal taboo SEX was in full force throughout, so was human desire to escape loneliness. The conflict between the necessity to maintain status quo, and the desire to break it, defining the border between heaven and hell, the mandatory suffering of being human---all elements were present. But the story was too simple for my taste. I did not see any end points that give one a significant WOW.I still recommend it if you are curious. If you don't watch it, I doubt you will miss too much."
3,So close to being a classic!,"Bernal is the weakest link here (as, obviously, the best asset this film has). A young catholic priest who starts off in idealistic glory and succumbs to the pressures of cotidian life: fine, but where was the soul searching, the agony and despair in informing his decision to embrace corruption and carnal pleasures? It can't be that hard to do, because Father Natalio ( a phenominally acted character) was able to do it with just a few chosen words and facial expressions: create a whole world, that is, and draw the audience into it. Yes, we all know the pressures on catholic priests in rural sub countries: but character development is always paramount, and it wasn't clear really how Bernal was evolving or why. Apart from that, the best Mexican cinema I have seen in a long time. Secondary characters were well drawn out and the scenery: sublime, with several tableaux vivant moments when Mexico really came out."
4,temptation,this is an important movie about the nature of temptation and the complications of living a double life.. It is also an interesting look into hypocracy.. All of the characters are involved in some dirty business.. and this leads to a tragic outcome that will leave us lost in thought at the end.. Very captivating..
1,Wrong recording,WARNING! I bought this Sonnambula and received instead 4 excerpted operas under the title QUADROMANIA. Even on the title of the CD is reads: COMPLETE RECORDINGS.
4,Samurai!,"Exelente para la decoracion, lo tengo hace ya mas de un año y el unico inconveniente fue que la escritura que trae a un costado que aunque se mira que esta seca la inscripcion, pues cuando le llego un par de gotas de agua devido al derrame de una botella de aguna las letras se vieron afectadas, y quedaron borrosas, la pintura del samurai es bastante diferente si es bien resistente!"
3,OK,Nothing to write home about. You have to like this genre type of movie to spend the money. There are better movies out there.
4,A Wonderful Complement to Kind of Blue,"This is a very nice CD. It has more of a feel of a Miles CD than some of Cannonball's other work (my favorite CD is ""Live in San Fran"". Like the other reviewers, the CD is worth buying for ""Autumn Leaves"" and ""Love for Sale""."
4,Wonderful!,"I saw the author for this book on a local t.v. program and decided to give it try and I am very glad that I did. Sap Rising is a series of short stories surrounding the people in Grandville, Maryland. The stories are very interesting, poetic and vivid. Lincoln's style sort of reminds you of J. California Cooper. Each character holds a different significance and importance to the next story. The characters share they hopes and fears on racism, class, status, family positions, friendship, dreams and the ever changing world. I think we will see a lot more of Ms. Lincoln. Congratulations!!Peace and Blessings!!"
1,Lessons from History,"This book is fatally flawed. Layard's notion that you can create happiness by removing risk from society is absurd. Risk and challenge are what keep us alive. Without it, we become nothing more than drones. Instead of spending the time on this book, readers would do well to read Ayn Rand's account in her first novel, ""We the Living,"" of what happens when people try to do just what Layard proposes in his book. ""We the Living"" is Rand's profound personal account of the swift and complete demise of her country and its people through the acceptance of the collectivist philosophies that Layard pushes in his book. Living in Soviet Russia just after the 1917 Revolution, Rand lived with all the socialism that ""Happiness: Lessons from a new Science"" claims is the only way, and grew to hate it all with such distate that she spent the rest of her life trying to abolish it. Her book alone is reason enough not to read this one."
2,A nice airport book,"While the ideas in the book are interesting and I happen to agree with many of them, the presentation clearly lacks rigor. The evidence behind the rationales is presented in a poor way, which makes conclusions appear weaker. Read this book if you have a few hours to spend on a plane, you will enjoy it. But if you are looking for a book that makes a convincing case for new measures of progress, this one is not for you."
3,maybe the dvd and an actual show are better,"i will say, this absolutely sucks on a cd! i mean to me, it just sounds like kmfdm were recording demo versions of songs. i mean, i have yet to actually hear the album ww3, but the songs from nihil and angst were a bit lame on here. maybe the dvd and ww3 album are better, and i am sure they are great in concert, but on here it does nothing when i can pop in nihil instead. too bad all of their older albums are increasingly hard to find....okay, maybe drug against war is totally awesome on this, but that is about all id ever listen to on this. get the dvd and all of the albums instead of this."
4,Over Arm Caddy Organizer,We are very satisfied with this product. It keeps everything handy and at easy reach.We had seen it at a relative's and were glad Amazon had the same product.
3,Great Work: Translation needs work,"For anybody who wishes to read Sophocles' Oedipus cycle, the best translation available is definitely that of Paul Roche. However, for what they're worth, Fitts and Fitzgerald have given a fairly accurate though often too swiftly-paced version of Sophocles' great plays. At times, the translation sacrifices accuracy for tersity, and rarely does it reach the poetic excellence that Roche's clearly demonstrates. However, Fitzgerald's translations often require an acquired taste. If you enjoyed his odyssey (I do not), then you may enjoy his translations here as well."
2,not the book as pictured,The book pictured is the book I wanted as it was to replace the one I have which has fallen apart. The book I received is a totally different edition so does not contain the recipes and suggestions I wanted
4,"I love this, for sentimental reasons",My mother used this cookbook when I was growing up. Nice to revisit her Sunday dinners exactly as she made them.
3,Not my favorite Quinn,"Though it was a pleasant read, I was a little disappointed with How to Marry a Marquis. I first fell in love with Quinn's work when I read The Secret Diaries of Miranda Cheever, and I am glad that I read that one before this. The characters in this book were not quite as deep and endearing as some of Quinn's other characters and I got a little bored halfway through the book. For those who have just begun reading Julia Quinn with this book and were disappointed, I suggest some of her later books like The Duke and I and The Viscount Who Loved Me."
2,Modern Dialogue,"Characters sound like modern people. They do and say things, and worry about issues, that modern people do. Why does the book take place in 1815? No reason for it to take place then.When the reveal about James' identity takes place, the heroine becomes really unlikeable. From there it's downhill. More and more unrealistic and the attempts to be cute and funny fall flat.It had a good start, but the second half just falls apart. Waste of a good premise."
4,Great book!,"I loved this one. The characters were great, the story was great, and I loved all of the tension and sparring. I loved that there was no nefarious subplot about murder or intrigue. It was a simple, straight-forward love story with a matchmaking twist.As with all J.Q. books, the love scenes were dull and NOT exciting at all. This is the reason I only gave it 4 stars. But that really didn't take away from the story too much. Overall, definitely one of my favorite J.Q. books."
1,A Sleeper not a Keeper,I was really bored with this book. The story sagged along and I was hoping it would get better. I usually finish books but decided not to waste my time. I read The Duke and I and it was much better.
3,at least i enjoyed this movie,"i found entertainment in this movie, could have been better, but much better then city of the dead, dead meat, zombie lake and others i bought recently, i will watch this again, which i can't say for half of the horror movies i bought in the last month, no hot girls in it, but i still liked the movie, it was worth watching, the zombies were scary at times, the storyline was good for a low budget movie, i would recommend this movie as long as you don't expect miracles from it,........"
5,Wonderful,"Most performers are enjoyed more after seeing them perform live. With the Avetts that goes double. Their performances are unique and terribly exciting. This video gives a good approximation of how they perform. Watch a few You Tube videos and if you like those, you'll really love this video. I've watched this so many times..."
5,Powerful Drama,THe title gave me an impression of some type of war movie. Truly Davis's character has adversity that strikes at the core of emotion. The war all humans can find themselves in when life struggles present themselves. Light pierces in through her darkness through by the powerful force of love. One will be pleased if a tear jerker is what you need.
4,"Very good, some haunting songs","A disk to listen to again and again, some real haunting songs. My Favourite is 'Blinded by the Sun'"
2,a let-down of an album,"If you are a fan of the Stone Roses or John Squire's guitar playing, do not buy this album. It will only disappoint you. Squire's great guitar skills do not show themselves, the lyrics are weak, the bass playing and drumming aren't very good. I think that ""Do It Yourself"" buried John's career. This album is not to be compared with other, superior brit-rock albums by artists like Radiohead, Candyskins, Oasis, etc. If you're a Stone Roses fan that just can't get enough, and are following their solo careers, buy either one or both of Ian Brown's albums. They are much better and of course the vocals will remind you of the Roses. I think I was being quite generous by giving ""Do It Yourself"" 2 stars. It's a shame, because John was so great with the Stone Roses, its hard to believe he has sunk to this level."
5,The BEST Godzilla Book!,"Quite Simply the best book on Godzilla. Thoughtful, Informative, insightful, Never stooping to the level of ""gee, I loved this film when I was 12 so it MUST be great!"" A type of ""critical "" writing too often encountered in fan oriented reviews, as well as a few more recent books to come out.If you love godzilla, the good AND the bad (yes children, there is such a thing as a BAD Godzilla Film...just watch Megalon, Gigan,godzillas revenge, King kong vs...ETC..)Get this book Now!"
4,An excellent look at Godzilla from a cultural standpoint.,"As a long time fan of Godzilla films, I'm always on the lookout for new books on the subject. I must say that Kalat's book is among the best I've ever seen, and is unique in that it studies the films from a cultural and sociological standpoint. Kalat's text is clear, his facts are correct, and his observations are interesting and often enlightening."
2,"Good acting, but predictable","I appreciated Nicolas Cage's acting in this more than most of his other movies. I figured out the ending of the movie rather early, and was disappointed that there wasn't a more clever twist. I would not consider this a comedy. I gave it 2 stars because I did like the acting, but I would not want to watch this movie a second time, I found it trite."
4,Well worth watching -,"Nicholas Cage is amazing in this film...Loved it.Rent it, buy it, watch it...you'll love it too."
1,This Stunk,"Bad plot, bad acting, bad filming. The surprise ending was a surprise because I had nearly terminated this boring, stupid film long before. The actress playing the little girl was especially poor."
4,Much better than the critics gave it credit for..much better,"After watching the critics carve this movie to shreds, I decided to wait until it came out on DVD. I am kind of sad that I did, because I missed a great movie - until now. The ""twist"" in the movie totally blew me away. There was no hint or clue that this was going to happen. I won't tell you the ""twist"" because I don't want to ruin it for you if you haven't seen it, but it's a doosy!! But I will tell you, the ""twist"" is of the magnitude of Sixth Sense - a total movie maker!The characters were nicely developed and Cage did a great job playing an OCD criminal. Lohan was extremely convincing as his new-found daughter and Cage's sidekick was certainly comical! The story is strong and production value is very high. The director gets my ""hats off"" award for this sleeper.Rent it or buy it! You'll be a winner either way!"
5,Exceptional,"Great cookbook. Book in superb condition and I really loved the warm friendly way Rachael Ray wrote. Recipe's are very interesting and I am thrilled to try another way of eating. Most recipes seem to include pasta of some sort,but nothing wrongwith that. I mainly bought her book because this was her first one, and it represents Rachael's determination to pursue her dream. I look forward to getting more of her cookbooks."
3,Buyer Beware...,"30-minute meals? I don't think so. What it refers to in the title is the actual cooking time it may take to make the meals. The preparation prior to cooking puts it well over 30-minutes. Don't be fooled.The lack of organization to the book is another drawback. It would be helpful to have an index to direct you to what you're looking for. Basically it's a book with a bunch of recipes thrown inside. With all these complaints from me, I still bought the book and actually my family has enjoyed several of the meals I've made. Just be sure to give yourself plenty of time to prepare and cook the meals. Again, don't be fooled by the title."
5,Fantastic Collection,Great looking blu-ray collection. Gentlemen Prefer Blondes and Some Like it Hot in particular look stunning! Nice seeing restored Marilyn films in a beautiful box set.
5,There should be a ...,"... The Forever Marilyn Blu-ray Collection Part 2. While this movie collection has some of my favorites, there are a few still missing."
5,Marillyn,"This collections contains almost all of my favorite Marilyn movies. She was truly a star and todays so called stars cant hold a candle to her. Thank goodness, thru film she will be preserved for future generations to see what a real movie star was."
5,The Forever Marilyn Blu-ray Collection,I bought this collection for my husband as a Christmas gift. He loves Marilyn Monroe and especially loves this collection.
1,How to completely disappear?,That's something I wish Radiohead would do already. They're worse than Tool. Don't buy this album. Buy Bellybutton by Jellyfish. It's way better. I swear to Jesus Christ and Martin Short. Honk honk.
1,I didn't think that they could get any gayer..(is that a word? Gayer???),"Listening to this album is like receiving a LONG SLOW ENEMA. I still have no idea what people see in this much OVERATED band. I understand the comparisons to U2 (which, by the way, is a far superior band), but Pink Floyd?? Pink Floyd runs circles around this poor excuse for a band musically and lyrically!! Creep is their only good song.....There I said it."
1,I don't get it ? Was this supposed to be good?,"For all their hype ... I don't get it.I bought it, gave it one listen and thought ""how boring was that!?!""Took it back the next day and traded it in for another CD.Mind you, I own almost 500 CD's and just as many vinyl albums and I don't get the Radiohead craze. I been told you ""have to"" see them live. I don't doubt it cause I've seen many a band that are absolutely fantastic live but don't come across well in studio. Must be the case for these guys cause they do nothing for me. Oh ... and then there is the song National Anthem on this CD. Finally a song that sounded worthwhile .... until they totally screwed it up with noise and horns and chaos. I felt like punching out the bandmates for ruining a great song. I wanted to like this band but, no can do."
1,droning and boring doesn't equal good,"people, it's okay to admit when a band you like puts out a ... record. Pablo Honey and The Bends had some brilliant songwriting. Great melodies. This sounds like the Demo mode of a Casio keyboard with some retarded guy on downers providing vocals. Use your money to buy lottery tickets. That is a better investment."
1,Over-rated (Kid F is more like it!),"This album is a shining example of how file sharing can save a music lover fromwasting money on over-rated trash. The songs all sound like someonesmoked some crack and entered a recording studio without instrumentsand pushed buttons on every keyboard they could find. Some here callit ""abstract""...but I call it unlistenable. This cd is proofthat if critics rave about an album, it's best to leave it in thestore. This group needs to listen to their first album again andremember what it's like to write a ""song."" This group istrying too hard to be hip and strange, and it leaves the listenerwondering what in the world are these guys smoking or injecting. Atleast U2 stopped their experimenting and recorded an excellent newalbum...I recommend that unless you are a Radiohead die-hard fan, youleave this cd on the shelf... U2's new album or even the Coldplayalbum ""Parachutes"" beats this...any day!"
5,patience rewards...,"ok, the wait is over. it's here. and it's brilliant.i didn't think that the first time i listened to it, in fact i was somewhat confused as to what they were getting at. i've explained this to friends like this: on the first listen i liked two songs; on the second listen i liked four of the songs; on the third listen i started to like the whole thing.... by the fifth listen it began to approach something like genius.granted i'm a fan and have been from the beginning. and yes, it's not the happiest album ever but i really believe it may be one of the best.artists taking chances and following through brilliantly are what makes enjoy art such a pleasure in the first place.radiohead's kid a succeeds on all accounts for me."
4,Listenable Portmanteau,"The first listen may put some off. After the first listen for a while, I skipped to National Anthem, Optmistic and Motion Picture Soundtrack. Then I listened to it again Then, it became clear. A lot of the songs may sound very similiar to the less pop orientated techno-dance-trance type going around ( Some smacks of Pop Will Eat Itself aswell ) , but it still sounds like Radiohead, and its still good. Many bands find it very difficult to follow a good album, so following OK Computer Kid A will always seem ""not-as-good"". This is a shame, since there is a lot of atmosphere to it, more of general suffocation than of the mortal fear of OK Computer.I wouldn't say it was a classic, because it isn't. Die hard fans will love it, and since no single was released in the UK, it still managed to get to no1 through word of mouth and the net. I didn't even know it existed until I saw it at no 11 in the charts as I was going home from work! :-) However, I love it."
4,Different,"This album is definitley a step in a different direction, to most people expecting ""OK Computer"" like sounds will be disappointed. I for one like this new direction, as well as 'OK Computer', but I also like D&B and electronica as well. to the die-hard Radiohead fans who remember 'Creep' will might want to listen to this before buying it. But on the same token, they may buy it anyway because they simply like Radiohead. Point is, it's a different sound."
2,Why?,"Honestly, I was never much of a Radiohead fan, be it back in 1993 when a couple of my friends started playing ""Creep"" off of MTV's compilation, or when those same friends tried to introduce me to Amnesiac. However, I thought I'd investigate their middle efforts and see what's been the big deal.Listening to Kid A, I don't find anything particularly engaging. If you listen to ""Right Place"", you expect some goal for trudging through it. But through the rest of the album Radiohead doesn't convey a clear purpose to their music.I don't expect the band to ""be"" anything, and I'm neither a fan that fell off nor a blind defender. But after this listen I wonder if the praise HEAPED on Radiohead isn't as formulaic as the rock against which Radiohead purports to rebel."
5,Machines of the Electronic Heart,"Kid A... it is more than you could ever expect from a firmly entrenched rock band, to say the least. Experimentation runs rampant all throughout the albulm here Kids. Thom and crew may have made their seminal work with OK Computer, but how do you follow up a seminal work? The answer is of course with something different, something ahead of seminal. Just as much as OK Computer was OK for radio, I really doubt Kid A will make it to any radio stations outside of college campuses. The stuff they are doing now is different, and is better for you and your sense of music appreciation than vitamins B-Z, because this is your vitamin A."
1,Kid ARGH,This was one of the truly worst CDs I have ever heard - I once bought a tex-mex macarena party cd that I could bear more than this horrible tripe. RUN away and do not buy.
1,Don't believe the hype!,"Many reviewers will tell you that ""Kid A"" is the sound of a band challenging their audience with experimental new sounds, radical new approaches to arranging songs and a fresh take on what it means to make ""pop"" music.I - on the other hand - will tell you that ""Kid A"" is the sound of a band totally out of sync with the rest of the world, with an inflated idea of what their role as ""pop"" musicians are, and with absolutely no clue as to what an experimental rock album should sound like.(An experimental Rock album, well, that's your ""Sgt. Pepper"", your ""Pet Sounds"", your ""Dark Side of the Moon"", your ""Achtung Baby""... )I can't decide if Radiohead should take MORE drugs or less drugs, but I do know that they ought to stay away from music until they start falling in love with songs again. Because this is the sound of a band that at the moment hates music."
5,Radiohead is brilliant,"OK Computer is, I believe, the greatest album since ""The Dark Side of the Moon."" Kid A is no OK Computer, but it is still absolutely brilliant. It is a bizarre album from a band which boasts 3 guitars, since there are very few guitars at all. Radiohead, as perhaps the most critically admired band in existence, has created an album which broadcasts their love of numerous ""underground"" artists- Aphex Twin, DJ Shadow, Autechre. This album is self-indulgent, but I appreciate that. I would rather people listen to Radiohead and move on to DJ Shadow than people listen to Korn and move on to Papa Roach. Politics aside, this is a gorgeous album which reinvents the parameters of ""rock,"" from the ecstatically elliptical opener ""Everything in its Right Place"" to the wailing free jazz of ""The National Anthem"" to the brilliant ""Idioteque,"" which proves that Thom Yorke is a musical genius as he takes a genre in which RH has never dabbled and makes a landmark song. Please buy this album."
3,mmmmmm....,"Ok,First of all, I think this is a great album. I don't think it's difficult at all though and so many people think complex equals brilliance. This is not the case. This album is neither complex or brilliant. In my opinion it is just a simple experimental album. This is not new territory either. Radiohead did not invent this new ""arty"" record. These kind of records have been made for almost 30 years, but Radiohead being the first commercial act to release one is now considered a pioneer. Nope. Not true. Don't get me wrong, I really dig this record, but everyone thinks it's brilliant and really have nothing to back it up by. The album is simple droning and at times interesting and at times stale. Buy it, enjoy it, but don't praise it."
4,Eno-esque,"While it may be true that Radiohead can be indulgent and overly experimental, almost to the point to of ""wanting"" to alienate the listener, let me say, that is the point. The band is doing what they do best, creating, exploring, and blazing a trail through the uncharted territory that is ""anti-rock"". Kid A is about resolutions, while OK Computer is about causes. Keep an open mind, and Kid A will grow on you."
2,"If you want people to think you're cool, this CD is for you!","Just when you thought that the music press had gotten over the ""if it's British and trendy, it must be fab"" disease, along comes the heralding of Radiohead's ""Kid A"" as a masterpiece. When Radiohead put their minds to it, they can product amazing, beautiful, sharp-edged Pop. This isn't it. THIS is a bad art-pop experiment, with only two actual songs, that is just overtly ""arty"" enough to dupe people into thinking it has a point. Surprise. It doesn't."
5,Kid A,"The thing that makes Radiohead so great is that they change with each album. If this record sounded like OK I would have been a bit saddened, even though I think OKC is the best record of the decade. Kid A keeps things fresh. It keeps things kinetic. And that's how I like my music. A static music scene is a bad one, and Radiohead are obviously trying to keep things moving forward. The record is great...the best of the year, probably. You should buy it. I'm sure if you're a music lover you'll love Kid A."
4,solid recording,"the best review i ever read on radiohead is -- 'you might not like/know radiohead, but your kids will.'listen to it on headphones."
4,solid record,"-- the best review i ever read on radiohead was, 'you might not like/know them, but your kids will.' --Listen to it on headphones.!"
2,I'm not fooled,"'Kid A' is a mess. To me this isn't really music; it's silly bleeps and squawks and unintelligible nonsense. I can hear that on any Stereolab record, thank you. This radical shift in their sound has alienated many fans, and rightly so. I know people will just gobble this up thinking it's life-altering music but if you want an album with proper songs look elsewhere. 'Kid A' limps out of the gate and hobbles home in a cloud of dust. The real big let down of 2000."
2,Months Later,"I don't judge albums by my expectations, but I do admit that they leak through from time to time. Regardless, I do believe that as a band you have the obligation to give fans what they want. The reason Radiohead has been so successful is their guitar-driven, opera-like, brilliantly unbelievable music. Guitar is almost completely eradicated on this record, and Thom's vocals, which in the past have been incredibly powerful and moving, are either used as backround or just not very passionate. I still have faith in Radiohead, they still have it in them. They are the best at what they do, I just hope they don't lose sense of what that is."
1,limited edition,I am submitting this review for the limited edition packaging. I am giving it 1 star not for the content of the album but for the fact that there really isn't anything in the limited edition packaging that couldn't have been included in the CD booklet that comes with the regular release. It is unjustifiable to charge more for this version as opposed to the regular version. This packaging is reminicent of a hard cardboard childrens book. It is only four pages of paintings of iceburgs plus a sleeve for the cd. There is no CD extra track. Get the regular release and save some money. It's what on the disk that counts.
1,Read the Truth About this CD,"Personally, I enjoyed htis band's previous albums. They had good singing, music, and lyrics.I can't say the same for the new album. The band appears to have forgotten how to sing during their years of fame. The musics is terrible, and the lyrics are just plain old crap.If you're a die hard fan of the cd or a collector of crappy music, this would be the perfect cd for you.For the other people, stay away from this CD at all costs."
2,Just Kidding A Round,Forgive me for not being a gushing fan. I'm just trying to help the average unhappily married family man who stumbles on this. If you like cheerful music don't buy this. THOM YORK proves once again the futility of success in buying happiness by giving us some more songs.... The instruments need tuning and Tom isn't spelt with a H. Now vote for me.
1,Don't get it,Huge Radiohead fun. But this album is hard to get into. It's so bad that the band released Amnesiac right after to cover up this failure.
2,Snooze-o-rama,"If this were not Radiohead, nobody would be buying or listening to it. And that's a fact. That said, ""Optimistic"" is a great, great Radiohead song; the rest sounds like you're listening to a seashell or to white noise."
2,Poor songwriting and Weak Style,"Rock music can be judged on two bases--style and songwriting(i.e substance). ""Kid A"" features some of the worst songwriting in recent rock. One star for ""Idioteque,"" the one good song in the entire album. (Fortunately, the band crafted better tunes for ""Hail to the Thief."")Record label markets the band as leading the revolution in wedding electronica to rock music. I beg different. Stylistically, Radiohead is neither leading, nor the best in the sub-genre of techno rock. To put is bluntly, they are not the first band mixing rock with techno...and they do not even do it well. One more star for trying too hard, yet failing to impress.For techno rock done right, check out U2's 90s Euro-trilogy, or anything by NIN, or Massive Attack's ""Mezzanine.""One more thing: please do not compare Radiohead to Pink Floyd. PF has this larger-than-life sound, that makes Radiohead seem like a sonic midget."
1,had to take it back!,"Being a Radiohead fan and running out to buy it on day one of it's release, I listened repeatedly hoping to find something I could truly experience.I ended up with nothing.Kid A has to be the biggest dissapointment of the year. I wonder how a band so intelligent and divergent could have created something so weak? It sounds as if they were doing a bad impression of Aphex Twin or Stereolab, mixed with a little 70's Elton John. Bad. bad. bad. bad. bad. It's so bad I figured this CD is a difflection until they are ready to let go of their collective brilliance again and drop a real CD worthy of my convo.Until then, I have Selmasongs by Bjork."
2,bah!,"band starts off modestly; band gains attention; band gets really good; band attains well-deserved popularity; band gets great; band receives well-deserved respect......band spits on it.this album is a sham. a perfect example of a group of supremely talented musicians reaching the highest level of worldly fame, where they can do no wrong, and thereafter spending a few addled nights in a studio, eventually releasing to the world (as a sort of grand esoteric, private joke) and album most of our little brothers and sisters could have created. i speak in hyperbole, of course...but just barely."
2,Just plain boring,"More than 7 years have gone since this record was released and I still don't get it. I don't get the average Radiohead fan hype about something so daring and original, which it is, but in all honesty Kid A doesn't give me the one bit of thrill, emotion and the desire to keep listening to an album over and over again like it did with OK Computer. I've spent years and years expecting this album to ""grow on me"" because that's what everybody's been telling, and still Kid A is remains collecting dust in my shelf, and I've given it more than enough chances to prove me wrong."
4,Wake Up Call,"Thom asks the rest of the rock world, ""Can you make anything original?"" Nothing will ever top OK Computer, but the depth of the music on Kid A is a deep, deep liquid."
2,The Ultimate Disappointment,"After one good and two great albums Radiohead wanted to explore new grounds, which is actually quite understandable. Unfortunately they failed to come up with something of any real interest or substance.There is not one real good song on this album. There are occasionally interesting sounds and passages, but most of it sounds like the soundeffects of a weird computer-game.For me this album was the ultimate disappointment of year 2000. Best track for me is ""Optimistic"".The second star is for the band's courage!"
1,Everything...in its Wrong Place,"Radiohead have gone too far here. They have released an album that is 10 songs and 49 minutes of complete noise. I agree with the 109 1-star reviews that this album has so far, and I'm about to make it 110. This album was a complete waste.I can't bear to talk long about such a bad album. ""OK Computer"" was one of the best albums ever. If they had just stopped there at that cross between genuine rock music and computer experimentation...but no, they had to take it one step farther. On this CD, they almost completely ditched guitars. ""Kid A"" seems an appropriate title, as any Kid A could have ran around the studio for 49 minutes pushing notes on various synthesizers.Overall, this album is a sincere disappointment. I recommend you buy it only as use for a drink coaster or if you are seriously considering committing suicide. Other than that, you will regret this purchase."
3,Radiohead- 21st century Innovators or World's Greatest Hoax?,"I picked up the CD without hearing anything, good or bad, about it. So, needless to say, I had no idea what to expect.When I heard the first song I knew I was in trouble. It was just a little bit too catchy. But as I continued listening to the album (7 times all the way through to be exact) I couldn't help but feeling very intrigued and, to a greater extent, used. Was this really a masterwork by a band that has always dared to stretch the limits, or an experiment by the band and its record label to see how critics and fans would react to a record that was not up to their usual standards?Either way, the songs are catchy and are pretty amazing in their simplicity. Maybe the band is too good for their own good. Even when they create something that isn't all that technically or sonically astounding, it will still get people listening over and over. And it will most certainly get people talking."
1,stop the pretension,"Please stop all the high brow posturing. All these reviews by people who are trying so hard to sound intelligent are tiresome. Sometimes a gifted band misses the mark and clearly any honest reviewer will admit that is the case with KID A. There are some interesting sounds and textures on KID A and obviously we are dealing with an extremely talented band. However, Thom and the boys forgot to craft those ideas into songs. This offering is a group of loosely arranged ideas eminating from long sessions playing around with machines and instruments. The real genius arrives when a band is able to craft their new sound and experimentation into classic songs, i.e. Achtung Baby. Radiohead needs to return to the studio with this material and finish the ideas started here. A clear dissapointment. Other reveiwers may disagree, but in the process, please do not argue that you have classic songs here. These are ideas, not songs. It is dishonest to suggest otherwise."
3,not Radiohead,"ehhh, this was too experimental. After OK Computer, this just went a little too far on the weird side. Thom Yorke sang way too much-a lot of the ambient music would have been fine without him howling in the background. Don't expect early radiohead with this one"
5,My favorite Radiohead album.,"Radiohead has been a hard band to describe. They did post grunge with their first album, spacy pop on their 2nd, and did a complete change of styles on OK Computer. On Kid A, they competly changed their style again to create one of the best albums ever made. Every song is brilliant. The title track sounds like a lullaby arranged by Aphex Twin, National Anthem is a drum-and-bass instrumental that just goes crazy at the end, Idioteque is a weird trance song, Treefingers is a beatiful song with no real melody at all, and of course, Motion Picture Soundtrack, perhaps the saddest song Radiohead ever did.Of course, people are going to say that it isn't original, and that it broke no ground at all. But I still give credit for Radiohead to change their style altogether. Good album."
2,Completely Overrated,"I wanted to like this album. I really did. Many people are saying how they have ""reinvented music"". That's a load of rubbish. There are a few interesting odds and ends, but overall the album is just not very listenable. Radiohead has made great music on their past albums and I think most people are grading this album on past accomplishments. It's mostly pompous, overblown noise. Don't believe the hype."
2,Get the 5-starred jewel-cased version.,"The artwork and cover for that matter are much better on the original version. This is much to expensive for such a bad package. Get The jewel-cased cheaper edition of this phenominal CD. The vinyl edition aint bad either if you dig vinyl.If you didn't get the Limited Edition of Amnesiac however, shame shame shame."
4,Everything in it's right place,"Kid A is great. It's not clear at first - even a real Radiohead fan has to give it a few doubtful listens (the first few songs in particular are a bit to get used to), but we had all been warned that it was experimental, and it is. And it's good. Techno-based more so than any other Radiohead cd, with a lot less emphasis on guitars, but after OK Computer, could we have expected anything else? This is the type of cd that you have to sit in a dark room and concentrate on, (although I admit I haven't done that yet) and you still can't take it all in. I get the feeling that after a few more listens, I'd give this cd 5 stars instead of 4."
3,A bit too electronic,"I have been a Radiohead fan since Pablo Honey, and though each album has had unique dynamics, there has been a general idea folwing through them. This album throws that ideal out the window and introduces us to a new, highly electronic Radiohead. I hate electronic music. I deplore drum-n-bass. But Thom and the boys do it well. Cheers to that. The album is good, but don't expect OK Computer."
2,All I can say is......,"What happened?!?!? Yes, things may change with the times, blah,blah,blah....if you were expecting anything like previous releases. Sorry to say, you will be sadly disappointed! We like Radiohead, cos, well, they are Radiohead, where are they in this??"
2,Kid A Not Ok,"If you're in love with Radioheads previous works of sure genius you might be dissapointed here with Kid A. This is a new adventure for the group putting away their driving drums for looped drum beats, melodic guitars for casio keyboards, and passionate vocals for whimpers and moans. Don't excpect to hear anything like Ok Computer here or other great recordings from the past like ""Fake Plastic Trees"" and ""Creep"". I think they spent more money on the pull out sleeve than the making of the recording itself. If you have the cd you'll know what I mean. Yes, add it to your Radiohead collecttion like I did but also watch it collect dust on the cd rack. Kid A is a Kid D-"
5,narrow minds make me ill (it is amazing),"it makes me ill to read reviews that say ""this is not radiohead,"" ""this is not music,"" or perhaps the worst of all, someone telling radiohead that ""they are a rock band, and they should stick with that."" what right do you have to say things like that? radiohead does not make music for people with narrow minds. since when has there been boundaries set on what is and is not music? this album is beautifully haunting from start to finish. it is not like anything they've done before, but this is what makes music so special. if you want the same music on every album, don't listen to radiohead, you will be disappointed. and by the way, if this was not radiohead i would still LOVE this cd. so go out and by this cd. and here's a suggestion, listen to this with headphones on. have an open mind and enjoy."
2,bah,"""...reveals them to be not only rock music's greatest adventurers in 2000, but teachers as well. --Beth Massa ""the amazon.com critic is even more misguided than the rest of you fools"
4,Great book,I loved it! Lord Peter is very clever and entertaining. A classic English mystery with lots of twists and turns.
2,Whose body,I read this book for a mystery book group I am in. I am not a fan of Peter Wimsey. I should have started reading this series at the beginning. I love the Butler.
5,Typical Sayers --- Great,What can one say about an icon except great. This book was new to me though I had read many of her books..
1,Disappointment,"The BBQ Rib Chew is coated in a gummy material that my pit bull decimated in mere minutes. It became unsafe almost immediately after unwrapping. The look and novelty is cute, but the function is awful!"
5,Delightful Introduction to Shiva,The book is delightfully written and as much fun as it is informative to read. The book radiates with the author's love and care to present nuggets of information from the scriptures related to many different aspects of Shiva and to support the stories with lots of beautiful black and white and color prints from different parts of India. The book is a genuine treasure.
3,"buick, olds & pontiac, full size models",I was really disappointed to find out upon receiving. This manual only covers v-6 models and I have a v-8 model. Who would have figured that full size cars come with a v-8.
3,Mixed Reviews,"This CD wasn't bad. It just wasn't especially good. I was hoping it would be more, but it's supposed to be made for the mainstream enjoying public. I bought this CD mainly for the song I'll fly with you, by Gigi D'Agostino (which was unfortunately the 3 minute version instead of the 7 minute version) and after listening to that, the whole CD went downhill. There were some highlights though, specifically Gigi D'Agostino, I'll fly with you, Moby's Bodyrock, and Sun is Shining, well maybe because both Bob Marley and ATB are amazing. BT tried very galantly to turn Sarah Mclachlan's 'I love you' into a dance song, but still the album wasn't very good. If you enjoy boring mainstream music such as bad remixes of TLC 'Unpretty' and Pink 'There you go' then this album is for you. But if you strive for something more danceable, something that has some club influence, with good beats and some trance undertones, then skip this CD and look for something better."
5,The Letter,Deffinatly one of Bette Davis best! Hard to believe the Brits/Aericans were so biased and solicious back then. Her image of walking (coldly) down the stairs and shooting is fabulous..The euraisian-wife was played over the top and enormously fun; but hard to believe she was chosen over B.D. Movie arrived in good shape but took a lonnngggg time to get.
1,hair killer,didn't even lighten my roots. I'm going back to preference light ash blonde pro keratin. And my hair was like straw. I was angry that I had to deep condition for 3 days straight. Pissed.
3,"Not really blonde, more ash gray","I bought this shade because the shade I was using which I believe was 9-1/2 NB, for Natural Blonde, would end up with gold or red highlights as it wore between colorings. I thought this shade would help neutralize that reddish shade. Too much!!!!! This color comes out a very ashy grayish blonde, not really beige until I've washed it for about two weeks and the color fades some. It definitely does away with the red/gold tint, but waaaaay too much. I'm switching colors back to a natural blonde shade. No more beige for this girl. But the formula itself, independent of the color, works very well and is easy to put on. It's very drip resistant so it doesn't make a mess everywhere. It seems to leave my hair in fairly decent shape as well and the after color conditioner is helpful too and smells good. Much cheaper than a salon and does a good job if you take the time to apply it carefully."
3,Decent Map,Used to Hagstrom Maps. The streets are sometimes indicated with thin lines making them difficult to see. The overview map could stand improvement. Does get me where I need to go. Would have preferred a Hagstrom.
4,Good reading,"This book helped me determine if I wanted to further my education. Although I was skeptical it would provide me with information, I found it helpful in my decision to pursue a doctoral degree and I am strongly considering it."
3,The real Fox Mulder,"He's called the real life Fox Mulder by some. If you believe in and/or have an interest in UFOs, this interview with Nick Pope, who investigated UFOs for the British Ministry of Defense will definitely be of interest. The MOD's project began in the 1950s during the anxiety over the war, and continued to track aircraft and fireballs by radar. Pope began his post with an open mind; hear how his opinions evolved with experience."
5,Great quality but very small.,"These cutters are of a wonderful quality and nice and tall, so you can cut through several cake layers, but they are very tiny in width. Just be sure that's what you want. They make lovely (itty-bitty) petits fours."
5,GLAD TO HAVE THESE,Very nice cutters in practical sizes that came in a small clear box to store them in.
2,they are just ok,the cookies baked without real definition from the crinkled edges. Not a big fan of them but ok.
5,biscuit cutter set,"I really like this set. I have used it just once, but the cutters are sharp and cut cleanly. Plus, I have every size I'll ever need! Based on other reviews, I was very careful to dry it before storing."
2,Animal Cutters are Small,The cutters appear to be of good quality but they are much smaller than I realized. I should have paid more attention to the size. I'm not sure how to successfully use these very small cutters.
1,rusted!,I thought stainless steel didn't rust? well this did! I only used them maybe 5 times and now I have trash.
4,Unnecessary linguistic authenticity,"In the great TV show ""Blackadder II,"" set in the 1500s, there is a scene where Blackadder visits the home of an old crone. There is a woman standing outside. Blackadder asks her, ""Is this the home of the old crone?"" The woman cackles, ""That it be, sir, that it be!"" Blackadder, disgusted, replies, ""Just say 'Yes it is!' 'Yes it is!'"" He is clearly fed up with this old-tyme grammatical construction, and frankly, so am I. Penman's characters talk like this...""This be the most dangerous undertaking yet, Ned!"" It's awkward to read and unnecessary.Otherwise I quite enjoyed the story, as well as most of her other works. But this is grating enough that I had to remove a star.(By the way, the old crone in Blackadder immediately drops the stilted talk and begins to speak to him normally.)"
5,Very Interesting! Well Done.,I like the scene selection built into this documentary. You can use it to navigate to different significant events in the history of the two nations. I really enjoyed watching this. It explains allot behind what has lead up to the events that are all over the news today.
5,A Crash Course in Modern Palestine,"In 2 CDs and about 5 hours this is a superb means to understanding the Current State of the Mideast. It uses personal interviews with American presidents and negotiators as well as interviews with Israeli and Arabs political and military leaders. Enhanced with very well edited historical films and news coverage, you get a balanced view.Ironically, by viewing the video you get a very real sense that progress is actually being made at resolving a conflict that has outlasted the British Empire, The Cold War, and a half century of US Presidents.While still a documentary it was captivating, interesting and extremely educational. You would be hard pressed to match this information in the viewing time. See it."
5,the greatest documentry series ever made,at first you think that the middle-east crisis is something that is happening far away in another country but when she this film you will release this unpleasent situation is like a suffering animal at second you think it doesn`t effects then it gives you an unpleasant correction it does effect us all and all it is great documentry.
3,Fascinating but dated classic,"As a compendium of all the battleships and battlecruisers built from 1906 onwards, Ian Sturton's book is an essential reference. But the line drawings are rather basic and only show a profile of each ship, and the photgraphs although well chosen are poorly printed and lack contrast and detail. There are better sources of information and debate, but as a collection of often esoteric vessels this deserves a look"
3,Don't misinterpret this item,"For some reason ""Hip Hop 101"" led me to believe I would be learning basic steps and moves to mix into any routine while dancing to hip hop. Instead I learned one short routine from this dvd that I will never ""bust out with"" -- it was broken down clearly and easy to learn, but not what I was looking for while spending $17.99. I'm going to look into an actual basic hip hop class."
5,Draw near to me CD,"I love this type of worship music, Thank you amazon for supplying these types of music! it's a great CD!"
5,Narrative Excellence,"Tom Holland brings the ancients to life, exposing the ambition and vanity of Pompey, the defiant attitude of Caesar, the greed of Crassus and the egotism of Cicero. Holland knows his material, writes like a novelist and compels his reader to learn more. As an avid reader of ancient history, I spend much of my time reading scholarly discourses which can often seem to focus on trivialities; Holland spends his time expressing the characters' thoughts and desires through an incisive reading of his ancient sources. If you want to introduce someone to the period, this book is perfect. For someone trained in the subject, this proves an enjoyable romp through Rome, written by a contemporary."
2,"Silly, tabloid version of the Republic","Although I'm a big fan of Roman history and the Latin language in particular, I was disappointed by this book. Tom Holland, a British novelist and radio personality, apparently thinks its important to put together a ""narrative history"" (his words - p. xxi in the Preface) and emphasize character development and personalities. So, eg, he speaks of Cicero not being ""one of life's natural party animals"" (p. 188), tells us Pompey had a ""swagger"" (p. 88) and reveals that Clodia had a ""taste for gangster chic"" (p. 226). Who cares and what's the relevance to the history?If you're looking for the last decades of the Roman republic as it would have been covered by Star Magazine, this book is for you. If you're looking for a thoughtful, detailed account of the rise and fall of the republic, look elsewhere."
4,Weaving together a coherent history,"Holland takes many strands of the history we have of the late Roman republic, and weaves together a coherent cloth of the story of its demise. Some may complain that this story differs somewhat from some of the historic documents we do have. But, the author correctly points out that none of these documents are both contemporary (as Plutarch wasn't), nor unbiased (Caesar's writings). By tugging a bit on these historic strings, we have a more complete story of how traditional Roman mores lead to the greatness and weakness of the Roman republic, and how it was unsustainable by the time of Caesar.As the late years of the Republic mirrors the life of Cicero, another book to read covering this span is Anthony Everitt's recent biography of Cicero."
2,"I love Lindisfarne, but the quality of this CD is a bit poor","Lindisfarne's ""Fog On The Tyne"" album has always held a unique and premier position in my vinyl collection. Somehow their unique rock/folk music takes my mind away like no other and simply makes me want to be there in a different time and place! As the vinyl became worn, I was always looking out for the CD replacement and ""The Best of Lindisfarne"" seems to be the closest I will ever get. However I must say that the quality of the CD recording leaves much to be desired. You can actually hear the needle landing and record scratch clicks on some tracks, and how the ""best of .."" does not include ""Uncle Sam"" leaves me a bit bewildered."
4,Sweet Southside Johnny,"If you're even a remote fan of Southside Johnny & The Asbury Jukes, this solo effort is a rediscovered wonder full of melody and feeling. The CD gets effort as it closes to the end. Tracks 6-10 are Southside as his bluesy best. Slow Dance, Your Precious Love, No Secret, When the Moment Is Right and Walking Through Midnight are all 5 star efforts. Slow Dance opens with the title track ... grab this baby before it goes out of print."
1,Even more bad than I expected...But not the good bad,"I expected these to be bad. I knew they would be bad. Some of my students (Junior High) and I were looking for Youtube videos of La Llarona, and found the previews for this. Knowing full well that these were going to be ""bad"" movies, I ordered it anyway. I've always agreed with Stephen King, and have actively sought ""bad"" in order to stumble across the occasional gem. There are none here. There is not even any zircon here. I don't quite feel ripped off by this collection, because I knew what I was getting, but it did leave me with the unfulfilled feeling one get when hoping for something, and getting nothing."
1,Not worth the time to watch it,"Probably the biggest waste of time I've spent on my couch. Could not even watch the first movie because the sound is so bad I can't tell what they are saying. The second movie was made better but was really short and the ending was a major letdown. The third was ridiculous, a few almost funny parts but overall this was pretty much the worst collection I've ever seen. I'm not watching the second disk, I'm just dropping it off at Goodwill."
1,A waste of a perfectly good disc!,"Folks, this helped me gain free shipping on my order! Don't bother buying it for entertainment however, the movies won't hold your attention any better than the average commercial! A total waste!"
1,Hostile Hauntings,Thought it was very boring. Waste of time watching it. It was foreign made and not very interesting.
3,Could there be any better?,"This is an informative commentary, done by one of the foremost evangelical scholars. Good for academic and non-academic use. However, the exegetical conclusions of work Bruce's work is hardly impressive. There are quite a few misinterpretations of some key passages passages of Hebrews, though many will not probably see it because of the veil that has been created in many evangelical circles. A more critical commentary is needed, but you probably will not find any. So, could there be any better?"
5,The Very Best! Grand Collection!,"A great and talented acoustic guitarist.You'll love the Tracks in this CD, beacause they are all very Good. Great Collection of Good and pleasant tracks! Listen to this Great CD, you'll love it."
1,Enough is Enough!,"Yet another attempt by Krugman to become the Richard Feynmann of economics.Feynmann had class, and style--in the classromm, and out.Something that has totally evaded Krugman. A lame attempt to spur on more publicity, hoping the Nobel committee will take note. Look, you're new trade theory was wonderful--SO STICK TO THAT!. It's no wonder that the Clinton Administration refused to offer him an advisory job in Washington..Way too self centered as an academic.An insult to academia in general, and economics in particular.(For insight into ecomics, no one compares to Milton Friedman and the Gary Becker!). I cannot but urge you to buy "" The Economics of Life"" by Gary Becker.Absolutely BRILLIANT!"
4,Love the Classics!!,"I love to read about the stories behind rock groups, songs, and song ideas. It is a fun read. A must buy for any music lover."
1,"Actually, this should be 1/2 star!","Poorly written, doesn't explain things at all. If you want to learn the fundamentals of Java, go elsewhere!"
4,Great deal for the $!,"We purchased this tractor about a month ago for my twin boys' third bday. They love it- no, adore it!! It is very detail oriented, in that it has very similar detail to daddy's JD lawn tractor. However, during the 2nd day of riding, the stering wheel came completely off, but I replaced it and made extra sure the screw was tight and have not had a problem since. One of the signal lights also came off when one of the boys' got too close to ""something"", but it just popped right back in and we've had no problem with that or anything else since. For the money, this is an excellent buy!! This toy had definitely been a huge hit with my boys and the other kids' in our neighborhood. I would definitely recommend it!"
1,This shouldn't be allowed on tv...,"Digimon is so overated. Its a pokemon clone. Theres no difference, in characters, monsters or anything, I'm glad that it wasn't very popular."
1,If you like to look at pictures................,"This book is filled with pictures of a huge variety of rather interesting ancient chinese weapons, from the decorative, and the practical, to the fictional. However, I do NOT recommend this book to someone looking for any information on them whatsoever. The authors knowledge of weapons, and his historical research, or lack thereof, crosses the borders of absurdity. He goes so far as to mention the weight of many bladed weapons as surpassing 75 to 95 pounds, and that is just the tip of the iceburg. (Perhaps the translator was at fault, but doubtful) Anyway, I bought this book to supplement my martial studies, and it was a waste of money. But, like I said, lots of pictures!"
1,Too much hype for these Noise albums.,Really Really Really stupid. I hate this cd. its all JUST FEED BACK AND NOISE
5,I've only ever read one other book that gave me so much.,"This is one of only a handful of books that have changed my life for the better. I have purchased several copies for friends and family. They all have thanked me. Thomas Sugrue writes this true story in a way that it reads like a novel. For me, it was a little slow getting going, but after the first few chapters I couldn't put it down."
2,baking with stevia,am trying to eliminate sugar from diet and recipes still have maple syrup and other sweetners in them. Wasn't what I was hoping for.
4,"A little dated, but a good book","This little book is older and a little dated, but overall it's a pretty good little cookbook. Be warned, though, that the recipes are for liquid stevia, not Truvia or the other stevia products that are like sugar. You can buy liquid Stevia on Amazon, though, or in most health food stores, so it's not that big a problem. The only problem I had with it was that a lot of the recipes were for stuff that most people don't have in their kitchen normally, such as agava nectar, and other health store-type ingredients. Still, there are some nice recipes in it and I found it useful for giving me ideas of how to adapt them for things I use now."
2,Pickover has 'picked over' the same material one too many times,Clifford Pickover is clearly proud of his prodigious output of books. Many of his book jackets highlight the fact that he's published one book a year. But at what price? I eagerly grabbed this book only to see some of the same old puzzles resurface that I've seen in two or three of his other books. I get the sense that Pickover has a giant file of math snippets that he reshuffles and repackages with slightly changed themes in each new book.Don't get me wrong; I think Pickover is a great popularizer of mathematics. I just wish he'd stop recycling the same material.
2,Well...at least it's only 99 cents.,"This is a poorly written story, with no real direction to the plot. I gave up on trying to read it after 25 pages or so. It reads like an 8th grader's attempt at an action movie script."
5,"""Garden of delight"", is it edited?","Is the episode ""Garden of delight"" edited? We see Lion-O, Cheetara, and Panthro in the dungeon rewinding the surveilence device that Panthro sent to spy on Tigre, who was overdosed and out of his mind on that fruit, and the nextthing I know I see Lion-O tied up likehe's about to be killed and Tigre back to normal. I just get a feel like there is something missing. Was something edited between those 2 points? If anyone knows the answer will you pleaseleave a comment.I love this show. I don't see what the problem other reviewers have with it. It looks fine to me. I am happy with it the way it is. The dvd's come in 3 standard cases 2 discs in each for a total of 6 discs."
4,"Great Show, but some NOTICEABLE PROBLEMS!","The Thundercats is one of the best animated series to ever come by. I was fortunate enough to be around when this was running, so like everybody else I'm elated to have the DVD. HOWEVER, I just watched episode 2 and there's a problem. THERE'S NO MUSIC! The minute the mutants encounter Mumm-Ra, or whenever us as the audience encounters him, we hear that eerie gonging theme music of his. Well it didn't happen. I watched the rest of the episode...and even when Lion-O calls the Thundercats, there's no music. I suggest you write the Warner Brothers Home Video and demand to have them fix that. Music is supposed to accentuate and compliment the visual; without that, the show seems boring."
1,Buy this video if you don't take working out seriously.,"My review is very harsh, but it is my opinion so here goes:I bought this video because I was looking for a different workout than all the others. What I found was offensive and didn't actually end up being a work out. The reason this video offended me is simple. The 'instructors' declared at the beginning of the video that it doesn't matter if you are ugly as long as you love your body. If I were leading a work out the last thing I would do is call the people paying me ugly or fat. They also appeared to be under the influence and had no idea what they were talking about. I would be terrified to let these ladies near anyone who is trying to learn about real physical fitness.So yeah. If you like watching two drunk chicks casually messing around with stretching or hand weights, then this is for you. If you are looking for something that will teach you something as well as make you sweat, look elsewhere."
1,worst workout dvd ever,"This really is the worst workout dvd ever. The arms section does not work you out at all and there is virtually no cuing. During some of the segments, the instructor gets bored and instead of counting starts saying dum dum duh duh duh ... badum badum badum... or something like that. The half squats they do in the butt section are just the right distance down to really injure knees and the way the two instructors, who obviously work out harder than this, talk about how ""this is killing me, yada yada"" is just patronizing. Also, if you read the book or watch the interviews on the tape, you find out this is just a marketing arm of their vegan propaganda. Which just makes it weird."
1,What a Joke!,"Let me start by saying.... I'm very active, exercising 4-6 times weekly. I thought this would be a challenging glute & arm workout but this is not the case at all.This DVD is a total joke. The sessions are not 20 mins as advertised (the glute segment is about 14 mins and the leg is maybe shorter than that, I started the arm session but didn't finish because I wouldn't tolerate the lack of form!!!!!).The in the ""A**"" workout, Rory looks like a ""deer caught in headlights"" as she intensely focus in on whoever is in front of her giving them instructions... That was a total turnoff for me. I tolerated the chatter and language but the lack of form I just couldn't handle.... THESE ARE GETTING RETURNED !!!!"
5,Excellent,This book is highly mysterious and totally cool. I have been waiting for the sequel to find out what happens. the book is full of such mystical and smarts that I give it a great review. i hope others do as well.
1,one of the grossest books i have ever read,I dion't care if this book had the greatest plot in the world it was absolutely gross. I can't believe this book was rated for young adults!
1,Horrible!,"This was the worst book I've ever read! It was a struggle to pick it up and finish it! It was slow, choppy, boring, and jumped from one place to the next something horrible! Yuck!"
2,Not for Me,"I have been doing an Ab Blast DVD from Jeanette Jenkins for about a year now and decided I needed to change it up a little. I bought this DVD as a recommendation from a relative who said the Abs of Steel series was fantastic. I have attempted this on several occasions knowing that it takes time to warm up to something different. I cannot warm up to this. The first few segments in (not the pilates and yoga portions) the line up were moving fast and almost putting a dance routine together without giving you time to learn the form. Just when you start catching on it's time to go on to the next move where you start over trying to learn a form. I am happy to work my body hard, but I need solid clear instructions. I also want to clarify that I have been working out 5 to 7 days a week for 4 years. I'm familiar with a lot of moves and usually catch on quite fast. For now, I'm sticking with Jeanette!"
3,Here Kitty Kitty Kitty!,"I will be honest, I'm not OBSESSED in this movie and there were only 2 tracks in this CD that appealed to me. They were ""After Her/ Cat Fight"" and ""Two Dogs And A Cycle"". The rest...is okay, I suppose. I really wish this soundtrack was available on ITunes so I would not have to buy this whole CD, but I guess this soundtrack is fine."
1,Did we see the same movie?,"A guy who yells at his kids and spouts endless cliches -- what is so great about that? And if he's so great at moulding boys into men, why are they drinking, burning down houses, etc.? And the side story of the JV runner was just cheap emotionalism. My wife (all-state in HS) and daughter (varsity in XC and track) hated it worse than I did -- made me keep fast-forwarding through more and more blah-blah.I am glad so many of you did like it."
4,A new twist on an ancient puzzle,"Do you enjoy working tangram puzzles? Have you ""hooked"" your child on them? We've been working with a puzzle thousands of years old. This is precisely what the author and illustrator of The Warlord's Puzzle team up to present to the reader.The author chose the use of the mathematical terms - parallelogram, square and triangles - in describing the shattered tile. The solution of the puzzle includes visualization, imagination, and determination.The author and illustrator combine to create vivid images of that ancient Chinese time period. One senses the cruelty of the warlord, as well as the timidity of the people in approaching him. The illustrations are striking. They depict the culture, customs, and costumes of the time period.Elementary teachers and those teaching mathematics - add this one to your collection!"
3,Not as pictured,The curtains are beige with yellow undertones. The cotton material is very thick. I had to change the room to a more country look with these curtains. I was expecting a more pure beige. They work well with dark greens and light blues if that is your color scheme.
1,WRONG SIZE. received 84 x 61 length. I kept them and reordered and got correct size,Wrong size. Geez. I ordered two 84 x 84 and the one set i received today is 84 x 61 so am waiting for the second set to arrive tomorrow. Maybe it will be the right size but then I will have mismatched sizes. I hate to return so will try to find a way to use the panels I received somewhere in my home.
5,Must have Scooby movie!,This is a great movie. I even watched with my 4 and 5 year old and liked it. I'm sure it will get watched many times. It has some old villians but new concepts.
4,More Sondheim Goodness!,"For a fairly recent video, I was a bit disappointed that it didn't come with any real bonus features. However the video itself is pretty great with wonderful musical numbers celebrating the body of Sondheim's work. Like any compilation, I'll always feel that there were songs I was hoping to hear that were omitted from the set, but that really can't be helped.It's a great video to have if you love musicals and especially if you love Steven Sondheim."
3,Well Recorded...Not Enjoyed,If you are a Steven Sondheim fan this will be rated much higher by you. It is a quality product.
3,<title>,"Honestly, this is like My Side of the Mountain meets Life of Pi but more boring. I did not find out until the end of the book that the girl was once alive, but it didn't really matter. I think this book is boring partly because the author, who is a male, fails to make his character, who is a girl, sounds convincingly female. She lacks, say, some emotions. When her father dies, she barely mentions it. She doesn't even cry, I don't think. Likewise, she doesn't seem to dwell too much on her brother's dying even though he is the reason she jumps off the ship in the first place. Even though this girl is supposed to be tough, I really still can't believe she actually exists."
1,Islad of the blue dolphins,WOW THIS BOOK WAS SOO BAD! IF I COULD I WOULDN'T GIVE IT A STAR! I mean there are way to many books about kids getting stuck on islands. Someone told me if I liked the movie Cast away with Tom Hanks I would love this. Boy were they wrong this book [was really bad]! Her brother is the reason that she stays on the island. The ships begin to sail away but her brother forgot something. He goes back to get it but he can't catch up. The captin wont slow down.So the girl jumps out into the water to stay with him. He wants to see the wild dogs on the island because he never seen them before. He had lived on the island all his life and he knew that they were not nice. But he trys to kill one because they begin to starve! He ends up dying because a dog eats him! Man it [is bad]. Do not read this! I mean dont you think that they would know how to survive on an island that they have lived on there entire life!
1,It was a great book :-),"Island of the blue dolphin written by Scott O'dell,was a great book. I recomend this book to 5th grade and up, dew to the books hard vocabulary.I like this book because of the exitement, adventures, and drama of karanas life on the island alone.Island of the blue dolphin is for peoplewho like to read about survivle and adventure.I dont think people who only like to read about comedys mysteries shouldent read the book.Island of the blue dolphinis about a girl who gets stuck on an island by herselfand learns how to survie and has a big adventure on the way. The main charcter of this story is karana. Karanas village was fleeing the island, but her brother forgot his spear and ran back.the ship left ,and karana threw her self out the boat to be with her brother. Shortly after,Karanas brother was killed by wiled dogs.Karana is now on the island alone."
5,Wassuppppppppp,"This book is a really good book ,I think that you should read this book. The book talks about a girl that lives on an island with other people. I think that they should have put in a little more detail. Chapter 19 is the best of them all,it is very suspenseful so read this book it is awsome dude. The story ends kind of sad kind of happy thats all I can say dude."
3,Just didn't excite me,"My babysitter got this out for my 8 year old daughter who loves to read, and I started reading it first to see if she would like it. I remember reading it as a child but couldn't remember whether I liked it or not. As an adult I found it somewhat interesting but not captivating. Nothing much happens, and I didn't think it was written in a way which would excite my daughter. I found myself wishing Scott ODell were a better writer--the descriptions of how food or clothing is made from natural products are so thin, compared to the Little House books (which are masterpieces). Since so many people seem to love it, I guess you just have to check it out of the library and see."
5,Island of the Blue Dolhpins --on cd,"The Island of the Blue Dolphins is an excellent story. I purchased this cd for my son who has had the book, & has got a coupple his teachers to read it the class. The reader does an excellent job in reading this book, keeping you interested. I myself enjoyed this cd, & have recommended it to my friends.Witchypoo"
5,Island of Blue Dolphins,"I love it! I first saw this movie when I was younger. I'm in my 40's now and still love it. Every time I watch it I need a box of Kleenex and I have a 9 year old Akita which I named ""Rontu"" after the dog in the movie!"
4,Another Newberry Award by O'Dell,"Could you live on an island alone for 18 years? This is what the indian girl Karana did in the Island of the Blue Dolphins. While she waits for a ship to return she has to make shelter,find food,build weapons,and fight wild dogs.Scott O' Dell wrote this book to try to tell the story of Karana. It is a historical fiction novel. Anyone that likes history or adventure should like this book.It's the best historical fiction book I've read. It's amazing,not many people could do what Karana did."
4,I like this book.,"I like this book because it has exiting detales. The words tell exactly what is happening. I like the part where she was fighting the devil fish untill she was weak. When she found the black cave, that sounded neat.Ithink this book is interesting."
2,AUUUGH!,"Okay I seriously can NOT beleive how AWFUL this movie was. Compared to the book,this movie is worth dirt. The actor who played Karana was awful! And it was just boring! We watched this in class after reading the book and it was SO not worth the time. I practily snoozed through the whole thing! The only reason I gave it two stars is because the dogs where really cute.I can NOT beLEIVE everyone in my class liked this,if you want a good story,go read the book."
5,The island of the blue dolphins,It is very good and I would read it again. I highly recumend this book for other people to read. It is very well written with great words that I didn't know before.
3,Island of the Blue Dolphins,"Island of the blue dolphins by Scott O'Dell is an exciting book about alady named Karana who looses everything she has ever known and is strandedon an island by herself. Her only companion is killed by a pack of wilddogs and she is left alone. She ends up making friends with animals andliving a well life. She makes things for herself and becomes veryindependent. I would recommend this book to anyone that is willing to reada book that is slowly played out but is worth it in the end. I would givethis book a 8 out of 10 because it was good but it wasn't excellent. ""Belowme, Rontu was running along the cliff barking at the screaming gulls.Pelicans were chattering as they fished the blue water. Far off I couldhear the bellow of a sea elephant. But suddenly, as I thought of Tutok, theisland seemed very quiet"" (152)."
2,Bad grammer,It was good but super sad it had lots and lots of messed up grammar. Someone should fix the grammar .
4,very interesting,"I belive that this book is very neatly writen and is very clear and understandable. Many say that it was filled with gore, but in my belife is that there was no such thing they just didn't really read the book. This is a heart stopping story of a girl left on an island off the coast of California, and of her strugle trying to live on her own and survive trough all that comes her way."
5,Enduring Childhood Literature,"I first read this book as a young girl in the early 60's and still gravitate towards the same copy I read in my children's elementary school library when I visit. When it was made into a movie and played at the local drive-in, I begged my parents to see it more than once. My oldest daughter, now 20, has read the book and when my youngest daughters, 5 & 7, are old enough, they'll read it also.I'm not certain what there is about Island of the Blue Dolphins that continues to draw me back to it over and over; I find myself scanning book lists for the title even though I already own it and have read it more times than I can count. It's the one I say is my favorite when anyone asks what's your favorite book of all time. My most vivid memory of the story is the hate Karana had for the wild dogs and the ironic love she developed for one of the pups who became her companion and defender.It's a wonderful story and belongs in every family library."
4,My Reveiw on the book,"This book is very dramatic, and a lot of people who like suspence will absolutly LOVE this book. It is about a girl and her name is Karana (Ka-ran-a) and she has lived on an island almost all of her life. Her dad was the cheif of the indian tribe that lived with her. One day a man with a boat that had red sails comes and makes a deal with her dad. Her dad agrees to thedeal, but the ,man does not keep his end of the deal so they have a war and in that war the men kill her father. While her brother Ramo, her sister and her are watching. A few years pass by and another pair of men visit the island whom on their ship have white sails and they volenter to take them with them so they go but her brother gets left behind. She jumps off the ship and saves her brother. I think that this book is a story about love and compasion."
2,This book was not very good.,"""Island of the Blue Dolphins"" was a boring book because there was not a lot of activity going on. All it was, was a book about a girl 'alone' on an island. There was no conversation or very much fiction about it. It would have been better if it talked about the animals being able to talk or if Karana would have been picked up by a spaceship full of aliens. This book took up a lot of my precious time. I didn't mind this very much because it was an easy 'A' if you followed along and paid attention. I would not recommend this book to be read again. I surely would never read it again."
2,BORING,"I read this book for fourth grade literature, and the only reason that I kept reading was because it was required. I thought that the quest for Karana's survival was at the best mediocre. There were long, tedious details about everyday life that didn't grab attention, and the storyline about foreign people bumping off the indigneous natives is getting old. And why is it that people are always making the foreigners the bad guys? The Island of the Blue Dolphins was an uninteresting, dreary novel that I think didn't really deserve the Newbery Medal."
4,Island of the the Blue Dolphins,"In the ""The Island of the Blue Dolphins"" I was amazed how she survived on the island by herself and how brave she was. I also liked Ronto beacuse I love dogs and Ronto is a dog I would like to have."
4,island of the blue dolphins is a great book,I think it was a good book I saw the movie too but it was black and white and very cheesy and Ramo died to easy and early I mean hes a kid he has like no meat on him those dogs are realy stupid but not Rontu hes my favorite and I feel bad for Karana that all her people died and she was thge last one but if you read the book it is actualy is good but you have to like history so I recomend reading it it gets booring in the begining but later it gets better later.
3,Island of the Blue Island,Island of the Blue Dolphins is a book about a girl who learns to survive by what she has seen and by what she has been taught. She also gets through many years surving by herself even though good things or bad. But in the end she learns a good lessen of responsibility. I really didn't like the book but who ever enjoys survival books they will really enjoy this book.
4,"Useful, but not perfect","This book is relatively helpful, but occasionally fails to describe important procedures. It'll say things like ""disconnect throttle cable from carbs,"" and then you'll have to just fiddle around with the cable until you figure it out yourself. I also haven't been able to find a diagram describing where all the different fuel and air lines go, annoyingly."
3,"Pleasant, But Ultimately Disappointing","I'd love to give this book a higher rating, but it's disappointingly slim in both size and content. It feels like the unfinished outline for a book which the author was never able to write. The author's entire marriage (of many years, and several children) is dismissed in two paragraphs. He frequently refers to the great and unbelievable stories he could tell about life on the road...then neglects to tell them. There aren't even any photos to spice up the narrative (though it sounds like the author never made enough money on the road to afford a camera). In all fairness, this is a pleasant little book, and not a bad addition to an existing collection for sideshow/carny fans. But there are other, better books out there which you should go to first."
3,Done a little crudely for my taste,"The title about sums it up... Nice, but not very neatly done (at least, mine wasn't) - for instance, dried glue showed from underneath the round decoration on the square pendant."
4,Nice for the Price,I bought this as a Christmas present and it seems to get the job done. Wouldn't be a wonderful purchase if you had to slice a lot.
5,the best pen,"I have tried many pens for my pets, and this is the most versatile, lightest weight, easiest to arrange in different shapes, folds easily, can be used as a fence as well as a pen. The tops and bottoms can be purchased in 4x4 or octagon shapes, and are made from canvas material. It can be a bit tricky snapping the hooks of the bottom and top covers, but for overall use, this one gets my vote and gets used constantly. Just ordered another one, I'm so happy with it!"
2,"Look great, but Doesn't work for smart puppies.","This pen was easy to set up and it look great. We decorated the pen with small toy, water& food bowl and small toys just for our lil girl Bella in order to bering her extra comfort. It didn't take her a full hour before she learned how to jump this pen. She is a small breed,(dorkie) but she can get enough height to jump this pen...she only 6 pounds and barely passes my ankles when on all fours. Even with the top cover she cleverly learned how to jump out within 24 hours. Going to return ASAP...so sad."
5,Legendary herbalist gives advise that works.,"One of my goats tore a flap of skin on a barbwire fence. The antiseptic from the vet didn't help and the goat would fight me tooth and nail when I applied it. So I got out Juliette's book and used her comfrey topical formula. The goat fought the first time but soon learned to accept it. Then her wound quickly healed! Typical of the results from world traveler, animal and herbal expert Juliette!"
3,"Interesting, but not for adult readers","While it was interesting and original,I would only recommend Malorie Blackman's Noughts and Crosses for teen readers. Unlike many other reviews, I don't believe that this book is for everyone. Blackman's writing style failed to keep me engrossed in the book, and while the plotline is imaginative and exciting, I still cannot say that I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I am suprised that almost every other reviewer gave this book five stars.If you are looking for a light read, or if you are a teenage reader, then this is probably the book for you. But if you want a solid, satifying novel, I think you might be slightly disappointed by this book."
5,Cat Stevens is timeless,"Sure he turned into a religious wacko, but in his day he was very thoughtfull and thought provoking. This is one of his all time greats.."
3,Works OK but not great,"First, I am on my second unit. The first one died within the Amazon.com replacement period and they replaced it without any questions. That is the wonderful thing about Amazon.com!! The first unit fried a few of my rechargable batteries and then it went up in smoke itself, literally. One day there was a puff of smoke, that terrible electrical burning smell and RIP. The second unit has been working well for the past 2 weeks."
4,Great CD,"one of the best R&B cd out. track 2-5,7-9,14 are the best song's. If you like this cd you will love Dawanye Wiggins new Cd(the other member of Tone' Toni Tony)."
4,best of all worlds,"when i first heard ""dance tonight"" i wasn't quite sure if i was feeling this new project. granted i was one of the biggest fans of Tony, Toni, Tone; EnVogue; and A tribe called Quest. After purchasing the entire CD however my mind was made up: Lucy Pearl, best R&B CD of the year. This album has the best of all types of music. Dawn's smooth vocals accentuate the track ""Good Love"" (#7 check it out!!!) I doubt if anyone will be disappointed with the investment. P.S. don't buy this one bootleg!!!"
2,Lucy Pearl breaks no new ground,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I found that the offering from Lucy Pearl broke no new ground. The album really flowed from song to song; because the beats were basically the same. The lyrics were a bit ordinary and the melodies were ok. I just got sick of hearing the same song 12 times. The other 3 songs are just variations on a theme from the artists' past. I still want to ""Dance Tonight"" though."
4,"Diamonds, Pealrs and Progress...","The debut of Lucy Peal presents progress in R&B, a CD that dares to take chances while never resting on the funk it gives from the beginning. It's great to hear Dawn Robinson on record again and her sweet voice blends well with Raphael's storytelling style. While many will question the CD's lack of surefire radio hits, the CD plays much like D' Angelo's, more of an album than a collection of producer-driven songs. ""Dance Tonight"" takes a back seat to songs like ""Everyday"", ""Good Love"" and ""You""(feat. Snoop & Q-Tip). Here's hoping Lucy Pearl won't end up a bad menage-a-trois and serve up a second helping."
2,Kwik Tek dock Lines with Snap Hooks,Not happy with the product. Would not buy them again. The plastic snap hooks snapped as soon as the water got choppy and the braided line is already fraying after a few days use.
3,Keeper of the Flame,"2nd Hepburn/Tracy pairing can't really decide what kind of movie it is and just doesn't gel. It's sort of a CITIZEN KANE meets REBECCA, and where the fascism-in-America theme is bold for the time--and has analogues to this day--Hitch did it much better in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT and SABOTEUR. Nice gothic atmosphere w/ MGM gloss in the dead hero/fascist's mansion and compound, but the twist is clearly telegraphed w/in the first half-hour, and the plot's wheels just spin after that. This being Tracy/Hepburn, the expectation of more romantic sparks than are delivered distracts from the predictable mystery. Richard Whorf is unctuous and menacing as the secretary, and Margaret Wycherly has a good scene as the dotty mother. 5/10"
3,Could have been better.,"Conroy is funny and the book is very readable, but I didn't give him a higher rating because I didn't think he tried very hard to know the people of Belize, or the country itself. He has a lot to say, all true, about the poverty and the governmental inefficiency when he was there, but didn't notice any of the natural beauty or the native culture(s) in this unique little place. He got really distressingly cold-blooded when he wrote about Hurricane Hattie, a tragedy in which there was great loss of life, and seemed mostly concerned that he wrecked his boots! If you want to know Belize, I would recommend that you read Zee Edgell's fine book BEKA LAMB, which is a nice antidote for Conroy's fin-de-colonialism attitude in this book. Conroy's attitude is reminiscent of Evelyn Waugh in this book, but although he is (almost) as cruel, he is not half so funny."
4,A Splendid Bio of a Confederate Naval Officer,"""Drawing upon obscure newspaper interviews and other rich source material, Delaney has produced a splendid bio of a Confederate naval officer. Kell was the driving force behind much of the success that raphael Semmes enjoyed with his raider Alabama. Delany fully depicts Kell's exciting life, giving thorough attention not only to the war years, but also the pre- and postwar years as well."" This review from America's Civil War magazine (March 2003) pretty much describes the book. It is a good, concise read for anyone interested in the naval aspects of the American Civil War, especially the role of the Confederate commerce raider Alabama."
4,Glenda Mooney...whew...,"After I read Piece of my Heart, i had to find another Julia Watts book. This book is about finding ones self through love, music, friendships, and pain. Glenda Mooney is one fiesty person who has no idea about life beyond the coal mines, but finds out that it isn't what she dreamed it would be...or is it? The true friendships with some of the characters is what made this book a true romance."
1,Please Do Not Purchase This For Your Beginner!,I'm a music teacher and I see these instruments in my studio all the time. I cannot stress enough that these are instruments are of VERY POOR QUALITY. The tuning pegs are very cheap and slip at the slightest touch. The fine tuners are even worse. Most students who come to school with an instrument like this have to end up going back to the store and renting an instrument after purchasing these! Please please stay away!
1,These bitches need to stay in the kitch'.,"Terrible. Luckily, I tried it from OnDemand and didn't waste money on it. ""Ok.Here we go. Let's move. Yeah."" Terrible motivators, very far from a boot camp. They have a good health food philosophy, but that is as far as it goes for them."
1,"Good for laughs, not an exercise video","After watching this, I wondered if it was a reality TV skit where teams are challenged to do something they've never done before - lead an exercise video. These girls might be fun to have a drink with, but they aren't fitness trainers. The blonde woman acts like she's in an Anna Faris role - not really awake, laughs at anything. The brown-haired woman just likes to yell bitch as much as she can. Both flail their arms without any instruction and stare robotically at ... the actual trainer? The teleprompter? Watch this is you're in the mood for a laugh."
1,AWFUL - condesendinig blather,"This workout is highly disappointing. These girls are obviously not fitness instructors, the worst part about this workout is the complete lack of cueing. They go from move to move with a countdown, but only once or twice do they tell you what move you'll be doing next. The way they act, you can tell they're taking cues from someone off-screen, I have to assume it's an instructor, to which I say put THAT person on screen and have these girls do the workout and add commentary. Not that the commentary is good, mind you, it's not. Don't waste your time on this one."
5,MEN SELLING MEN,"A FAST PACED FIRST PERSON NARRATIVE OF THE LIFE OF CAPTAIN THEODORE CANOT, TRADER IN GOLD, IVORY AND SLAVES ON THE COAST OF GUINEA CIRCA 1854. CAPT. CANOT HAD QUITE A LIFE AND THE BOOK IS WRITTEN IN A MANNER THAT SEEMS TO DEFY DATING IN THAT IT IS EASY TO READ; TO GET INVOLVED IN, AND GIVES ONE MAN'S VIEW OF AN ERA THAT PLAYED A LARGE PART IN HISTORY. NOT AS ROUGH AS ONE WOULD EXPECT."
2,Boring Captain,Most of the book dealt with the lifestyle of this captain and not with the logistics or details of the slave trade itself. I did not find it interesting.
4,Great sound for the price,"First of all, this will not ""blow you away"" with the sound quality. But it's battery driven, (a/c adapter sold separately) and it's relatively cheap, and much louder and crisper than the laptop speakers on my powerbook g4. Not much bass, but the 'wide' sound effect is pretty nifty, and you can get by with these in watching a movie on your laptop.I do wish that it had an option to be powered by USB, and that the a/c adapter was included.If you are looking for more bass, don't get these. If you are looking for better sound than your laptops that don't cost too much, get these."
5,"Chicago, warts and all","This is the book that the Chicago Chamber of Commerce didn't want the world to see. Instead of pumping up the tourism and real estate industries with promotional-pamphlet blather, Algren's essay presents the real history and state of Chicago: the back alleys, the dispossessed, the swindlers dressed up in their Prarie Avenue finery, the kill-or-be-killed ethos of this cutthroat ""trader's town."" Seldom has indignation been so lyrical."
5,A Great Success!,"On the Banks of Plum Creek begins to leave the ""little child"" stage of the Laura Years. The writing style changes, and Laura is beginning to grow up! I love every page, from town party lemonade to the old crab that lives in the creek. Overall, this book is very enjoyable, and relatable too. Please, if you know what's good for you, you'll read On the Banks of Plum Creek."
4,A diverse collection of sources,"Jon Elliston's 'Psywar on Cuba' is a wonderful resource for anyone researching the US involvement in Cuba. Whilst it is perhaps lacking in enough narrative and giudance, it succeeds in bringing a wide range of sources together, such as media broadcasts and CIA declassified documents. It works well with Fabian Escalante's 'The Secret War'."
3,Butterfield 8 Even Liz Taylor thought it was bad,"Liz Taylor was forced into making this picture.She even wrote in lipstick what she thought of this movie on the bathroom mirror (saw all this in a PBS interview) this is [poop].And I agree. This is one of my least favorite films of her's. I saw it for the first time only recently (2002), and wanted to lie it despite her bad remarks about it. I thought... awww she is being to hard on it, but no. It was a very forgettable film. Watch it once to satisfy your curiousity, it is not a rewatchable film. Shame."
2,Wrong number for Liz,"While Elizabeth Taylor is visually beautiful in this film the script is extremely dated and hackneyed. Women are all sluts or as blindly devoted as dogs. Being a ""fallen"" woman means you have to die dramatically. The searing scene where Taylor reveals the trauma that made her what she is is the only dramatically realistic minutes in the movie. Everything else is cliched dialogue and overheated acting. Better to remember Liz for A Place in the Sun or some of her other better films.The believability of scriptwriting and acting has improved light years since this quaint early 60's period piece."
2,Shallow,"Very slick and sophisticated, but with absolutely no feeling or depth. Harvey is appropriately slick and insincere, Taylor comes off as a shrill harridan, and Merrill resembles a mannequin. Some of the dialogue is ludicrous even for 1960."
5,A Trip Back In Time,"Par l, Superior. Liz,s emoting was so sincere and genuine that you almost had to share them and join her. Besides, my beautiful wife of 64-years could have been a stand-in and double for her and Liz.s action took me back to our childhood days when we were so much in love and still are. It was a nice journey in retrospect."
4,"A good DTS disc, but...","One of the better DTS discs that I've added to my collection lately, but the center channel is underutilized. (In fact, there's barely any sound coming from it at all. They must have recorded the center channel at a ridiculously low level. At that point it just gets drowned out by the other 4 channels. Why even bother?).Still a pleasant disc to listen to, but I wouldn't advertise it as a ""5.1"" disc. Maybe ""4.1"" would be more accurate..."
3,The solution for Dell Axim users,"I called VEO before ordering this product. I was told that if I receive the Pocket Traveler for Pocket PC and the last three digits of the serial number end in a number lower than 960, it would be too short for the Dell Axim by 2mm. I was instructed to RMA the product I receive and they will ship out the newer model that works."
2,1/3 megapixels and out-of-focus . . . a toy,"The Veo's V600000 name belies its capabilities. 600000 (six hundred thousand) is a far cry from one third a megapixel. Don't expect prints larger than a business card.Focusing is merely guesswork . . . I suggest enscribing a distance scale rather than focusing by eye.However, it is a toy, and fun for about five minutes. Its true value may be as a mini-camcorder; for instance if you are ever in an accident, it may prove useful to your insurance adjuster. I tried to use it to photocopy a newspaper article (like a Minox) but have failed."
3,Beautiful soundtrack!,The movie was a letdown. And goodness knows that Katherine's daytime wardrobe could have stood improvement but I was enchanted by the theme music by Herbert Strothart. I am unable to find it anywhere. Does anyone have any clues how can I obtain the soundtrack?
3,Good looks but you need to consider design,"One of the reviews that influenced my decision said it took 15 min to put together. Well that person must have a tweekable nose because nothing could be further from our experience. First of all not all the holes connecting pieces lined up. Secondly the door design is not only faulty without an actual hinge,it doesn't fit right. We ended up buying hinges to get it to hang right. And, finally, and perhaps most importantly, no where does it mention in the decription, (that I was aware anyway) that the cabinate needs to be fastened to the wall to keep it from falling over. What's up with that? The looks of the cabinet are great now that it's together, but getting it that way was a hoot."
1,"Nice Try Murphy, But No One Cares","This book is one of the saddest works I have ever read. My utter disdain with it stems from its poor writing style, its inability to stay on the subject at hand, and the gramatical errors that lie within it. If you are looking for Murphy's opinion on everything from the way the world should work to what constitutes violent behavior, give it a read. I advise you to use your free time for more worthwhile sustenance."
2,Day of Reckoning review,"First of all I think that the ""Day of Reckoning"" should have been read over a few times before it was published. The author does hit on some good points, allowing the reader to know more about the Columbine High shootings. The author jumps around alot inserting comments and paragraphs that should not even be in the paragraph. It was a very poor book. The author tries to insert to much into one paragraph as well as the chapter. We need to read the book so we can empathize with the family of the victims. But the author put me in a place of confusion and he is a very poor writer, however I would recommend this book to someone else to read not because it is a good book but because it has some good points on Columbine that can be enlightful."
1,A Day of Reckoning: The Massacre at Columbine High School,"Murphy's lack of knowledge and ability to write makes the book very difficult to read. He doesn't cover anything that relates to the Columbine Massacre, but instead places useless information about the ""World Wide Web"" and ""KMFDM"". Yes, the two teens were users of the internet, and may have listened to bands like KMFDM; however, Murphy's writing is completely incoherent. By the second page, he begins to discuss topics that are not relevent to the incident. He also writes as though his readers have never seen or even heard of such things like the internet. Maybe he should stick to being a history major, and not try to become a famous novelist. If I could give this book negative stars, I would. I highly recommend saving the [amt]and spending it on something more useful. The novel should have been called, A Day of Reckoning: The Massacre of a Novel."
3,The Chicago Mafia,"Good God! Why didn't the contingent from Chicago designate one person to be the official reviewer? Blah Blah Blah Blah. I am sorry that it sounds like you HAD to read this book, and I can see why you didn't like it, but come on. 59 reviews? And let me just say this to some, not all, of you reviewers : from a guy who isn't a wizard at spelling himself, a few of you are living in glass houses when it comes to grammar and spelling. Check back and see if I'm lying. At least you're reading."
4,"Sleek design, must break in","I love these black DC shoes. They have a sleek, no-frills design. The only major drawback is that you must truly break these shoes in."
4,The secret peace negiations of Himmler.,"Himmler was evil, maybe even more so than Hitler. However, he was very smart and knew that Germany would lose the war by 1943. The author expresses the opinion with some well researched documents from the British public archives that Hitler engaged in peace talks with the British government. The British were engaging in this exercise so they could cause political turmoil in the German government. Himmler was doing it so he survive the Second World War. Ultimately, Himmler may have been killed to prevent him from telling of his relations with the British during these negotiations. As a previous reviewer has already stated, wheather Himmler was killed by hanging or earlier in a murder does not really matter. He was an evil man who deserved to die.This is an OK espionage book. I gained a little insight into Himmler and his relations with the rest of the inner Nazi circle. These were evil men, and I can equate them with a den of snakes."
4,"Eat your heart out, Russo","R.D. Reynolds is one of the better writers of wrestling books, Mick Foley excluded, and he proves it here. He took the time to go incredibly in-depth on the Death of one of wrestlings greatest companies, World Championship Wrestling, and it shows. While Reynolds is (self-admittedly) not a fan of Vince Russo, Eric Bischoff, and Hulk Hogan, he keeps these prejudices to himself as much as possible and comes out with an excellent book for any wrestling fan who missed the humiliating end of WCW. A highly recommended read for any wrestling fan, even over Ric Flair's book (though not over Foley's)."
4,Rockports for women are hard to locate. Amazon came to the rescue,I LOVE Rock-port shoes. Around here they are quite difficult to find in Women's shoes. The only thing I would have differently is a little more arch support. But that was easily managed with an insert for a few dollars.
4,Beautiful Insanity!,"Daisy Chainsaw was one of the most imaginative bands I have ever had the chance to listen to. It's sad that the band was somewhat short lived and most people have no idea who they are, and they are severely missing out. Each track of beautiful insanity with catchy instrumentals and Katie Jane Garside's vocals, at times screaming, gasping for breath or even vomiting (I love the Future Free.) is just...great. Eleventeen is a fantastic album and it is a shame that it is out of print. And since that is so, if you can get your hands on an album don't ever let it go!"
4,Hoping All Your Dreams Come True...,"What more can be honestly said¿ If you have not known about this band more than you do 'not' hear of them too this day, then:a.) you either have been under a rock OR...b.) you were not Enjoi'ing yourself upon spending the early 90's looking for an alternative to Silverfish (another fine example of this genre & sound as well!)Upon reading; know that this was PRE-Nerdvana / Manson-esque days here w/ all the glammy, grungecore gore they could glop on top! Overproduced & under-rated were this band of post-rockers w/ a flare for the brash et al. ::PLUS:: This Hi-Fi more punker than thou lp contains more *unf* too boot than the above lamercore.If you are lucky enough to come across this relase at this point buy, hide it, & cherish it as it were out of stock as the ""relic of loveliness"" that it is!Did i forget too mention that they looked DAMN kool as well¿!?Enjoi!"
5,"""Monkey Business"" review","very funny, vivid and true to life description of the life of an associate in the investment company, highly recommended for those who work in investment banking and allied industries, you won't regret spending some time on reading this book!"
3,Entertaining but not very well-written,"Entertaining but not very well-written...and after 9/11/01, they really should change the cartoon on the front cover."
2,written by whining brats,"I bought this book primarily because of its supposedly ""candid"" view of I banking. What I found it to be was a book written by two ungrateful whiners. Despite the fact that they are travelling by private jet, staying in world class hotels, and earning over 200K a year, they manage to whine that they are over worked and just ""cogs"" in the machine. Give me a break, im sure that by the time they graduated Bschool they knew what investment banking entailed. I banking is not an emotionally rewarding profession, and most corporate positions are not. I dont know what these guys were expecting."
4,quick read,"There are some good chuckles in here for everyone, and it paints a pretty decent picture of what new banking associates will need to endure during their first few years in the business (if they last that long). Even better, it is a quick read for those without a lot of free time on their hands to spend reading a book."
5,A lesson for the Wall Street neophytes.,"Finally someone is speaking the truth about life on Wall Street. It is amazing with what tricks and finesse investment banks recruit young people into their torture chambers and turn them into money-hungry paper-pushing machines. It was delightful to read Monkey Business and learn that other former Investment Bankers feel the same way. And its a relief to know that Rolfe and Troob have made their way out of the industry and moved onto bigger and better things. I highly recommend this book for anyone currently or historically involved with the whole Investment Banking and Wall Street culture. It certainly is hilarious to read about the authors' own experiences, and you can even learn a thing or two."
1,Vulgarity Lives!,"How typical of a person who works at a successful firm to write a bunch of garbage about the firm that pushed this person above the ordinary and through the mill to become a trained and skilled Wall Street employee. I for one thought this book would be a good read, and looked forward to its release. How disappointing for me! I can only hope that the garbage spewed by these so called former bankers does not reflect how many others on the street feel towards their fellow workers, the work and their firm! I am proud to state that I work for the very firm they are slamming, but then they could not withstand the challenge of the firm they are writing about. I have been at DLJ for 14 years and can honestly say, only the good survive at DLJ. Others write books!"
2,OVER RATED,"This book is higly informative, however the writers should be bankers and not try to pose as authors the style is weak and the content could stand some work by a professional editor. As for the story these guys are cry babies who complain about working long hours and working for maladjusted ego -maniancs. Boo-hoo I am crying out loud for you when you take a job in banking you sell out for the 200K comp. package. Get real guys you have had everything in you life handed to you. Take this book for the info about the industry and look past these wimps rants. These guys hopefully will never write another book. Save the money and get this at the liabrary, you do not want to own this."
5,Great Book!,"As an MBA grad going into banking next year, this is fun read (though hopefully over the top!) and rings true with a lot of what is said. Enjoy!"
3,"Crude, But Effective","The authors effectively demonstrate, albeit in an exaggerated and polemical style, that the ovewhelming drive and incentive to do a deal for the sake of doing a deal compels investment bankers to sell their clients short and to give their lives to their work. Banking is, of course, not the only profession that is a jealous mistress, but the lack of formalized, guiding ethical precepts (like the ones found in medicine, law, and accounting) in this profession is disturbing. A useful afterward traces in broad strokes how the Wall Street engine of doing more and more deals to generate more and more fees led to the Crash of 2008. There seems to be a need for greater regulation and transparency.The humor tends to be on the crude side, and the book lacks much of the charm of ""Liar's Poker."" But these guys are funny and make their point effectively."
2,Awful writing,"This book tries unsucessfully to imitate ""Liar's Poker"". The authors exhibit an astounding amount of prejudice and tastelessness. More importantly, there is little self-reflection on their part. If what they write is true (which, for an outsider, is hard to believe), ""Monkey Business"" raises more questions about the authors' character and intelligence than about investment banking in general or DLJ in particular."
5,Investment Banking is uncovered in this great read!,"""Monkey Business"" does for Wall Street what Upton Sinclair's ""The Jungle"" did for the Chicago Stock Yards! This humorous and lively book uncovers some of the less glamourous features of the world of investment banking. It is a tale that any aspirant should read and will be enjoyed by a much wider audience as well. Behind some of the sordid stories in this book are some real lessons about work and life. The loss of innocence of the authors as they go from starry-eyed MBAs to burned-out refugees of the investment banking fraternity was touching to this reviewer. However, the touch throughout the book is always deft and amusing. The language is sometimes a little rough, but the authors' evident credibility lends considerable weight to the book's total honesty."
3,Where's The Plot?,"While Monkey Business contains some funny anecdotes, two things become quickly aparent when you read this book. The first is that Troob and Rolfe are a couple of clowns. I have little sympathy for a banker who complains that he doesn't get any sleep, but spends a few nights a week at Shenanagans until 4am. However, they should be commended for not masking their initial naivite in the industry as it makes some of their actions understandable.The second (and most important) is that the story reads like a pitch book of complaints - section by section with no conflict or compelling reason to keep you reading. The book is enjoyable in chunks, but it could have been so much better in more capable hands.Anyone dying to read a great book about Wall Street greed should check out Liar's Poker and F.I.A.S.C.O. Monkey Business will leave you wanting more than it can give."

We feel that you should be aware of what songs are on this album before making your purchase. Enjoy!]"
3,Wonderful until the end,"This book started out with sharp humor and a thrill, and got better and better as it went. Ann, the main character, was witty, funny, realistic and vulnerable, and the other characters of Bea, Roger, Father Stevens, Kevin, etc, were well-drawn, likeable and intriguing. Throughout the book, the suspense rose, the humor continued, fascinating bits of history were brought in, and an intriguing conflict between the various characters' Christianity and atheism was introduced and well tied in with the conflict between Christianity and ancient religions in the house. A storm lead to an exciting climax. Then...thud. The ending was a complete let down; it was as if the author got tired of the story or ran into a deadline and just plunked it down. I enjoyed the rest of the book so much that the ending was quite a disappointment and I almost felt cheated. I look forward to reading other books by this author, and I hope in those the endings match the quality of the stories."
3,"In with a Bang, out with a Whimper","The beginning and middle of this book was great. I was completely immersed in the story. I was so curious as the the cause of the mysterious happenings and really liked the characters. The ending was a complete letdown. It was like the story just faded away into nothing. After all of the buildup, there was nothing left in the ending. A complete disappointment!"
2,broke while filling,"It either already had or obtained 2 holes in it while I was inflating it. The package didn't seem to have been opened already, so I'm guessing they were obtained while inflating. The thing kept falling apart, so I spent most of the party going out to the front yard to make sure the skirt and balloon lady weren't strewn about the yard."
3,Pie Pan Punch,The service in receiving the book was excellent. The book was not quite what we were looking for but there was no problem with the seller.
2,Shoot THE MESSENGER,"Kurt Elling's freshman CD displays all the problems of a young artist showing off before taste, restraint and maturity thankfully caught up with him. Aside from a few wonderful cuts, such as the swinging ""Tanya Jean"" and a duet with Cassandra Wilson on ""Time of the Season"", much of the ablum is an unlistenable collision of Elling's worst excesses in vocal flash against blaring crash in the arrangements. Case in point: The unfortunate version of ""Nature Boy"" which opens the album, and which Elling and Co. send to Pluto and back before it slams to Earth. Anyone looking for an introduction to Elling - and he is one of the most thrilling, amazing jazz singers out there, particularly when seen live - would be best off with one of his later efforts, such as the lovely extended mood piece of FLIRTING WITH TWILIGHT or 2003's jazzy THE MAN IN THE AIR, which displays the matured Elling at his best. As for THE MESSENGER, don't bother to answer the call."
5,Why isn't this woman famous already...,"she is as good at what she does as Linda Eder and Diana Krall are at what each of them does best. A Canadian, Janice has a brassy, sassy, sensual side that is really fun to hear. Her backup band is sensational, and her song choices sizzling. In the 16 tracks here, all written originally for Broadway musicals, Ms. Hagan takes us back to the jazz/pop era of '50's standards as rendered by Ella Fitzgerald, Peggy Lee, Sarah Vaughn and other greats. Most are up-tempo, and all are at the very least, entertaining and competent. Most are somehow better than just ""competent and entertaining."" This lady can really sing, and demonstrates an artistic sensibility which is really nice to see in a person not yet born when most of her chosen songs were written. Check out her samples and I'll bet you'll buy this. And don't overlook her Christmas CD either."
1,BLEH!,"Worst violin ever! I have seen child violins that are better. Don't think about it. Waste of money! The strings are low quality, peg box is chipped, varnish comes of easily, bridge is slanted, and a cracked fingerboard!"
2,Not worth the money,"I bought my Cecilio a year ago, I have had a luthier replace the bridge, the strings and move the soundpost and it still sounds terrible. I wish I would have visited the flea market and got an old beater upper fixed it up for what I have invested in this one."
5,One More Mission,"I highly recommend this book for readers of any age.However it was particularly interesting to me as a fellow member of the same squadron and group. We were both on many of the same missions and his recollections matched my own. An excellent contrast of what bomb raids were like in those days with 700-800 bombers compared to more precision bombing done today with far, far fewer planes.The first half of the book describes life in the 20's, 30's and 40's in Texas. Although my experiences were in NJ many were similar and for those not living in those times a glimpse of what it was like."
5,A very cool lamp,"This lamp is awesome. Once you turn it on, it looks just as it does in the picture. I was very impressed."
5,My children love the Rifleman.,Could someone please tell us which episodes are contained in this video
1,the rifleman,"The RiflemanI would have liked to known the episodes I was getting on each DVD. We have the same shows on a DVD but no way to tell it was the same. The picture on the front of the DVD's are all different. Now we have 3 episodes over and over, three different times.Sorry this happened."
3,"For casual fans of ""The Rifleman""","This three episode collection issued by Alpha Video contains the same three episodes that have been issued by various companies specializing in public domain material; in fact, if you already own any DVDs of the Chuck Connors Western ""The Rifleman,"" be sure to compare the episodes on your discs with those contained on Alpha's so as to avoid possible duplication. The episodes include ""Outlaw's Inheritance,"" ""Day of the Hunter,"" and ""Mail Order Groom."" For casual fans of the series who would like to include a few episodes in their classic TV collection, this DVD will fit the bill nicely. But serious fans of ""The Rifleman"" will want to check out the various official DVD box sets issued by MPI for the best episode selection and best audio/visual quality.Trivia Note: John Anderson guest stars in two of the episodes, ""Day of the Hunter"" and ""Mail Order Groom."" These two episodes were originally broadcast just a week apart!"
1,The Rifleman,"The Rifleman,Poorly advertised, only 2 episodes, not worth the price. A total rip off. They were 2 of the worst rifleman episodes."
4,Outstanding!,"This book is a beauty! The photography is beautiful, the writing is thoughtful, and the authors took the time to touch on a variety of topics, some of which are seldom if ever written about elsewhere at any great length(ie: precision skating). A great book for fans, athletes, and casual observers alike!"
4,Cute Puzzle,This is such a cute puzzle for little girls. I love how thick the pieces are as well. The puzzle had accidently gotten wet and it didnt damage the color or wood. Little girls will love this dress up puzzle.
4,Very cute and easy to use,My daughter really likes this puzzle. I like that she can do it by herself. Regular puzzles are still too advanced to play alone.
3,"Good, but dated","Interesting history of Weber carbs, with general theory and specific info on a range of side and downdraft models, but dated (1988). Good for restorers, but if you're doing a new 32/36 or 34 DGEC conversion on a Jeep, for example, it's not covered in this book."
1,It was good but not great.,I don't know it was ok but it really a lot of parts made me forget about reading it and then just put it away.
3,Close to the edge,"I think Harold Vick was quite a genius i'd listened "" steppin out"" and ""straight up "" and also caught up with ""au privave"" done by Eric Gale - Arthur Blyhte - Harold Vick - Idris Muhammad - Charles Earland whew blowing me away, but what i'm trying to say is what a few years can mean? somewhat 3 years between steppin out and straight up and his playing is different like blowing superb gliding scales on straight up i can't comprehend it blows me away listen to ""Like A Breath Of Spring"" on straight up, i'd guess the only one who does it today would be Branford Marsalis."
5,Trapeze Kitties,"My girls have not seen this yet, but I assure you it is going to be a huge hit. As soon as I saw the package I realized this is what my one daughter has dreamed of. She's constantly creating trapeze and swings with whatever she can find. And both the girl (Lea) AND the kitties swing on the bars. This may be their all-time favorite Polly Pocket set."
5,Magic for Marigold,"I love this book! Montgomery eliquent use of prose,her vividimagination and poetry allow the reader to see life throughMontgomery's eyes. Montgomery's talent as a writer enable girls young and old to view life in its wonderful aspects as she does in Magic for Marigold. Marigold is a delightful girl with wonderful dreams and high adventure. My personal favorite is her journey with the uncontrollable princess and her midnight rendevous with Budge. I recommend this not only to girls young and old but to mothers to read to their childeren. Everyone should read L.M. Montgomery's books. I guarentee joy and happiness with each page."
1,I hate this book!,"Everytime I read something out of this book, I come away feeling like a failure as a parent. Ask my husband: he has to talk me down every time. I don't know why we still have the book laying around. The author is condescending, anti- attachment parenting, and anti-cosleeping. I hate, hate, hate the term ""accidental parenting"" that she throws around to cover everything from nursing your child to sleep babywearing. I disagree with one the previous reviewers (who also reviewed this book poorly), although perhaps our babies are different ages. I think The Whisper does encourages Crying It Out, at least for older babies.I highly recommend chucking this book in the trash and checking out Dr. Jay Gordon, the Sears', or Elizabeth Pantley."
2,More stressful than helpful,"This book has some good suggestions for routines, but other than that it has been more stressful than helpful for me. So far my son has gone from sleeping through the night from 8:00pm to 5:30am with 45 minute naps to now waking up at least every 2 hours and napping only 20 minutes at a time. My biggest complaint is that her suggestions are often counter to a baby with reflux and gas issues needs. (I can't up his feedings b/c he spits up what his tummy can't hold.) The Baby Whisperer has solved none of my problems."
5,Help with new baby.,This book was recomended highly to me by a friend. She said it pointed out several situations for her. My little girl is just over a year old and I'm expecting her brother in a few weeks. It's very insiteful and has many ideas and suggestions for both children.
1,Do not use a book to parent!!,"My 6 month old was not sleeping as great as i wanted him to and my sister-in-law recommended this book. She said her 5 month old was sleeping 10 hours a night! Well i bought this book along with the others by this author. When it arrived i was so exited i read the entire thing and began ""baby boot-camp"". Well the first night he sleep 3 hours i thought no way, this is way worse than before, but i kept hoping it took getting use to...well 3 weeks later and he is doing horrible.. he wakes up 5 or 6 times a night and hates bed time... my husband and i couldn't go out anymore and it just sucked!! So i said forget it i am going to just parent the way i want to and listen to my baby not a time-line and the first night off the book/routine he woke up once and slept for 10 hours!! I think that your baby is unique and doesn't fit into a schedule! I would not waste your time with this book... i know i wish i had not put my baby through all the tears :("
5,Excellent,This book allows you to gently guide your child to a schedule and help them sleep through the night WITHOUT advocating any cry-it-out strategies which Hogg calls a breach of trust with you child. What a gift to help reach some of the same goals with your baby without the crying or harm that does to them!
2,Problems Unsolved,"This book was highly recommended by a couple friends, however, I did not find some of the information and suggestions by the author very helpful. I felt like some of the information was contradictory (i.e. don't rock your child to sleep because then your child will become dependent on it vs. don't rock your child because it is too stimulating for him or her). She discusses accidental parenting in her book, yet I felt like some of her methods could become forms of accidental parenting. After spending two agonizing days trying this method out with my daughter, I started doing something different and we were much happier. I felt like the author made readers feel guilty if her method does not work for them. I do, however, like the overall concept of feeding the child after waking up, having wake time, and then putting the child down for a nap. That has worked very well for us. This book may work for some parents, but it did not for me."
5,Practical tips infant and toddler care,Tracy Hogg has had a lot of experience with new parents. She gives a her special expertise in baby care. She seems to have many common sense solutions of baby care problems.
5,Andrew & Kim,"I'm actually on Amazon today because I'm going to buy this for a colleague who is having her first baby. This book was absolute lifesaver. Like most new parents we had absolutely no idea what the baby wanted and way too much old school advice from well-meaning friends and family. We agreed to try this book for two weeks and there was never a question as to how great the advice was.We agree with some of the other reviews about the author's tone. Fortunately, you cannot argue with the results. Her methods were spot on accurate and our children immediately adapted to the EASY schedule.Thanks Tracy!"
3,Lots of examples,"Lots of suggestions and examples of helping your child's eating, sleeping, and potty training skills. A good reference book, not one to read right through, but use as your child ages and develops."
3,growing on me,"The older my baby gets, the more I like this book. When she was first born, this book made me feel like I didn't know what I was doing. I was sleep deprived and pretty sensitive at the time. Now that I am more reasonable, I see that she has some great ideas. She does have a very condescending tone to her views. The ""shh-pat"" never worked for my baby, but pick-up/put-down did. I don't know what my baby's ""type"" is either, I wasn't too worried about figuring it out. The sleeping and feeding advice were more interesting to me. (She did have me a bit paranoid that my baby had reflux though.) I do like that she broke her advice down into age groups. Sorry for the wishy washy review, this book falls right in the middle for me."
3,ok,"I wish I have this book before we have the baby, that way I can read it all the way. I only read the first 3 chapter and it was very good. I hope I can read the rest of the book."
3,It's ok,"Not all of them are the fairy tales I would have picked for a Must read tales, but still interesting"
2,"Just an ""okay"" movie","I thought I might like this movie & I got it for a pretty cheap price. I was disappointed & the story was dull & uninteresting all around. (Sorry Richard D.) I like his other movies, but not this one. It put me to sleep."
5,Great Product,"I bought these bases for my fifth grade class to play with at recess. They are sturdy and stood up to the task. They don't move which was our second most irksome problem. They are easy to see in the grass, and I and my students couldn't be happier."
2,Quality Falling,"I've been buying these socks for about 10 years. They fit great and are comfortable walking socks. Unfortunately, the quality is not what it used to be. The tops of these socks now unravel after only a few washings. Once that happens, the sock starts degrading rather quickly. They just started making them cheaper. I doubt that I'll buy any more."
3,"Actually, a four and a two...","A few minutes into ROD, I began to sense a ""Dracula meets Timmy and Lassie"" plot developing, so I flipped the DVD to The Vampire and endured a formulaic Fifties ""Monster chases Blonde"" plot. Not a bad movie, but not very interesting. Then I went back to ROD and was soon mesmerized by Francis Lederer as a very solid and sinister Prince of Darkness. Really, this guy OWNED the role. The writers also created deeply philosophic vampire theology in Lederer's dialog. Too bad UA didn't start its own Dracula franchise with more of Mr. Lederer."
3,Where' the theme?,"This is one of my all time favorite classic tv sitcoms. I collect lots of shows and this show brings back lots of fond memories. This video was good but buyer beware....you should only get it if you truly just have to have the commercials. They are truly a treat. The show itself has been edited, this might be due to the commercials and the show was a rerun at that time and was cut for time, surely they didn't do that on it's original run. And the worst thing is the theme song has been edited out and a strange new beginning and ending are installed. It's almost scary seeing Oliver and Lisa doing their opening to a strange instrumental song, it almost sounds like it has been added by the company who put the tape out....WHY!!! Buy it for the commercials not for the show."
1,I really wanted to like it...,"I was looking forward to getting this book so I could finally get a ""definitive"" history of the movement. Unfortunately, I got a poorly written free association from some guy who is a skinhead. The quality is at the level you would see at an internet discussion group : not something worth paying for, barely worth reading. Do not waste your money on this book.It is not at all clear from this book what the essence of the skinhead movement was or is. It seems what unites them is their uniform : the shaved head, suspenders, and black Doc Martins. Beyond that, the book gave me no sense of what the skinhead movement is all about. If you are a skinhead, and know all the jargon and history already, then you might appreciate the work. I, on the other hand, wanted to learn about the history of this group from the *outside*. The book is not written for outsiders, alas.Very disappointing. I should have known by the title: this is not a history, it is a eulogy."
4,3.5 really,"Like someone before me said; if you're into the skinhead scene, then there's probably not going to be a whole lot of new information here for you.The book's a little better than average, though I expected something a bit more considering how long I waited to get a chance to rea it. This book's a bit hard to get, especially when they're selling for over $100! I secretley suspect that George Marshall himself's got a stack and sells out a couple at a time.The style guide at the end was pretty cool."
2,maybe he's right,"Why has no one provided a good rebuttle to Bloom? This is the best I've seen, and it's not very strong. Sure, it's slick and full of grand academic watchwords. But it smacks of the blind veneer of today's academia, full of a baseless hope in ideologies that are D.O.A.. I had to read Bloom's book about 3 years ago as part of a course, and I read it with many doubts. But having graduated, now reflecting on my own experience and the sad ineffectual responses to ""Closing"", I am starting to think that maybe Bloom was right: Our universities are in trouble, and Levine, by trying to say otherwise, only proves it to be the case."
2,DON'T BUY THIS....,I bought this DVD in the hopes that there would be some nudity. The NOT RATED sign on the cover fooled me into thinking it would be somewhat explicit. If you want an explicit reggaeton DVD buy Gatas Sandungueras for some naked babes. The videos were ok music wise but some videos did not feature very many girls. If you like watered down reggaeton videos with no nudity then this might be for you.
2,Buyer Beware!,"This card gave me a fatal blue screen with the following error:DRIVER-IRQL_NOT_LESS_OR_EQUALSIIG's support told me that this means that it will not work on my system. I did some investigating and discovered that this card is compliant with PCI v2.3 specification and my motherboard supported only PCI v2.2. Before you buy this card MAKE SURE your motherboard supports PCI v2.3!I have obviously never had a chance to test out the functionality of the card but I figured it deserved its low rating due to the irresponsible documentation which fails to issue this warning. Even SIIG's online hardware compliance form failed to alert me to this.If your motherboard supports it, I'm sure it will be a good card."
4,Great collection of hard to find titles,"This 50 pack is unlike the other 50 packs which have a lot of repeats from collection to collection. This one has only swords and sandals type which are not on many other collections, and none of the other 50 packs. I have not seen most of these before and so far they are great. None are remastered, of course. Sometimes the image quality leaves much to be desired, but these titles are mostly not available in any cleaner prints so you might as well save some money and buy this pack as the foundation of your ancient genre movie collection because probably they will never be remastered."
2,These do chip,"We also have several different versions of these glasses. Many have the color chipping off. My wife is quite disappointed with this, although she really liked the overall quality and design."
3,Pricing Error,"The price on the jacket of this book is $19.95. I bought it used for fifteen bucks. What's with the over $100.00 price tag? ... I mean, it's a good book, but it's dated (there's a section where the chapter author recommends a 16 megabyte computer for her home office (pretty good for the 1980's when it was originally written, but not even up to speed for 1997 when the book was updated). Are these prices a simple typo, or is someone trying to price gouge?"
5,"Proof of the collective unconscious,,, she knows what you feel..","If you have not heard Bird York you are missing more than just music,, you are missing an experience.... Her voice, a distinctive instrument of sultry and wispy energy reaching to the core of your heart... her words are more than words,, they are an old soul conveying familiar experiences of life, love, and pain... do yourself a favor, get this CD, sit back and hold on while Bird lets you ride on the wings of her soul.."
4,Mellow,"Really enjoy listening to this album. I love Jack Johnson's version of ""Pirate at 40"" and that was the reason I purchased the album. The entire album is enjoyable to listen to. What a nice surprise."
1,not the same,"Jack Johnson is my all-time favorite but this album falls short of his sound. Just my opionion but I returned the album because the songs were just not ""his sound"" to me."
1,"DON""T WASTE YOUR MONEY","Not anything like the series. Don't waste your money. Selling dvd strictly from reputation of series. First 15 minutes or so was all black and white. It did get better about 20 minutes into the show, of course it didn't hurt that I hit the fast forward button. I was so bored I wanted to cry. Half hour in I watched another 10 minutes before turning it off. My time was better spent watching the series. At least they were funny. I only wish I could shove this piece of sh@t up the creators @ss."
2,The show was much better,"I loved the show Tripping the Rift, it was always funny and I very rarely missed an episode. When I watched this movie however I was completely disapointed. The whole first half of the movie had nothing to do with the second half, it was 2 entirely different story lines and the jokes throughout the whole movie were stupid a obvious.Oh and for anyone wondering if there is any nudity (from Six)... NOAround the 25 minute mark I regretted buying this movie and was just hoping it would end soon so I could watch something better."
3,Kind of funny: boso the robot after the three eyed horney toad,"Boso, the robot, is in terminator mode and is unstoppable.Chode, the purple horney toad, is the target.It is ""Pigs in Space"" as a cartoon that visitsthe bride of Frankenstein, the desperate housewives of suburbiaand a gay bar. Sometimes the dialog thinks it is too funnyand laughs at the punchlines for you. In a way it makes mehomesick for Bugs Bunny... or Road Runner.Some Eric Frank Russel stories that had much more imagination than this. For some reason they think cows, three boobs and three eyesmake for real humor?The one eyed wino in the alley may be the funny part."
1,always know when to get up from the table,Got a small film off the NET. It was great. Bought the entire series. It was good. Bought the movie. It blows. One star rating because six of one- half dozen of the other is very fine.
3,Hey ..for 10 bucks......sold,"Tired of waiting to see when season 3 will be release, and this dvddisguised as a movie will fills the void pretty good at a great cheapprice. Was it interesting....sure it was...and im glad i got it ..andwill get season 3 if they ever release it on dvd."
4,Awesome!,"I only gave it four because I haven't worn them very often. But so far, we've had flooding, big rain puddles, snow, etc. and these have held up FAR better than the sixty dollar rain boots I got at Macy's that cracked after I wore them like three times.These are awesome, haven't cracked their plastic yet and I don't think they will."
1,ripped off,"I bought this jacket a couple of years ago, and loved the style! I was so excited for about the first month, until the leather started falling apart. Shoty stitch-work,showed abrasions and wore out quickly!! Just wore the jacket for casual wear, this should not of happened!Would not recommend this jacket to anyone."
4,Vastly Underrated Guitarist,"Green's life reads like a litany of Jazz cliches: brilliant sideman gets addicted to drugs, graduates to session leader, records some killer sides for Blue Note, records some less stellar sides for other labels, then dies young and is forgotten by most.Which is unfortunate because as my review title says, this guy was an underrated guitarist who could and did play in a variety of styles and did all of them well. For Green's bluesier side I strongly recommend ""Grantstand."" For a more variety-pack of an album I recommend this one.I enjoy Grant Green's work at least as much as Kenny Burrell and other jazz axemen who get a lot more respect. Do yourself a favor and check out this CD and Grantstand as well.One more thought...was Bobby Hutcherson ever on a BAD album? I'm starting to have a ""Hutcherson litmus test"" when deciding what to get...if Hutcherson's on something it's always great!"
4,KATELAND,"A movie that held my interest throughout. A lawyer who is married meets another woman, ends up marrying her. And then along comes Nichole. A beautiful and dangerous woman, who decides that she wants the husband now. After boldly telling his wife that she wants her husband. The beautiful, and sexy Nichole goes after him, and successfuly gets him. But many things happen in between. This film has a few unexpected twists. And theres a surprise ending too. A really good movie throughout."
4,Do Unto Others,"Joy Fielding is one of my favorite mystery writers, and this is a well done Lifetime Movie adaptation of her book.Josie Bissett plays an attractive woman, Jill Plumley, married to a successful lawyer, (Ted Whittall) whom she met while he was still married. Now she has to worry about the sexy young vixen from his office who is openly making a play for her husband.To add to her distress, her husband's boss is murdered, his wife is found badly beaten, and Jill's friendship with the wife involves her in the mystery.It's a good movie with a good cast. Unfortunately Ted Whittall plays dastardly husband Derek so well, it's difficult to believe that a basically decent person like Jill could have any interest in him. Also, unfortunately, he has a teenage daughter and so it's good that she has a decent, if flawed, role model in her stepmother."
4,good product,"This is a good product for the money but as the other reviews mentioned, a little thin. So I wouldn't leave them outside. Overall they are perfect for light use and we like them. Still a good value."
2,Great for light use.,I bought these bases for my backyard and practice situations. It was much thinner than i thought it would be.
2,Not Used,Have not used this because the instructions are very lame. If I had it to do over I would have ordered one that comes with rubber tips that are inserted over the metal ends.
5,Helps sooo much.,"I have a german shepperd puppy, 5 months old. And with a regular collar, he pulls and pull choking himself badly. I had a friend with one like this and she let me try it for a walk. at first he did freak out a little because of course it was new. But after a few minutes he realized it was not bad. They look mean but are so AWESOME for dog training. He now does not pull, and is very well behaved with his collar on. Its mostly there just as a reminder to be good. And the quick release is amazing. easy to put on and even easier to take off. I hope all people see how great these are!"
3,could be better,"I ordered these collars because I have 2 very large dogs,one is a mastiff and the other is a black lab. I have used these collars before and was happy with them..but the large size they advertise is not accurate. I had a bigger collar before this one on the mastiff and the lab had the next smaller size ..so not I have 3 of the smaller size...so what im going to do is split the links on my old one onto the new ones ...was hoping to have ordered the bigger sized one ..but oh well Ill make it work..but for over 20 dollars expected more..."
3,"Great Book, Poor Recording","This review is for the MP3 CD unabridged version of Dragonflight put out by Blilliance Audio.First, each MP3 file is a full chapter. And it is recorded at 96kbps, which for an audio book is great. I have ripped many an audiobook audio CD to MP3 at 48kbps, or at most 64kbps, and had a great copy. The sound depth with only one vocal and no music is shallow enough for this to work fine.But the recording, while clear enough to understand, is poor. [This, as I have since discovered, for some reason is only present if played over speakers, when I use my iPod the recording doesn't reveal these problems.]"
5,"Really, Really, REALLY good!","Dragonflight is about PERN when thread hasn't fallen in 400 years. I really liked the book and I love Lessa's character. I think people who read the book think the way Lessa is childish and silly. I personally think that if F'lar wasn't always saying how awful she was it would never occur to you. I also don't really like the way F'lar treats Lessa all of the time. He fell in love with her after Ramoth's flight, not just because of herself, so I don't think that the way she snubbed him should be used against her character."
4,The chronicles continue.,"For me, this book wasn't as gripping as Dragonquest & some of the other books in the series, but I liked it nonetheless. It seemed more like an opportunity to introduce us to more of the characters that we met in the first book, and who we would keep meeting in later books, than a stand-alone story. If you are interested in Pern, definitely don't read this one by itself. It's best to read the books in order as many of the people and story lines run through more than 1 book and catching some in mid-stream could be distracting."
5,Dragon Flight,With my ability to use my imagination it was like I was right there and living the story with the characters. Loved every minute of it and can't wait for the next adventure
5,Dragonflight,Very good read. You will like thsi book; adds to the story of Pern in a logical way; although it can stand on it's on as a stand-a-lone story.Recommend you check the flyleaf to find other stories about Pern
1,Stupid story....,i don't see what's so great about this book. i;m halfway through it and it is boring for the most part. i could care less about the charecters and nothings happening. all they do is sit around and talk. Don't waste your money on this book.
5,one of the best books I've read in a long time,"This is the best, and the only book by McCaffrey I have read compleatly, book I have read in a long time, and I've been reading for a while. I am currently in the middle of Dragonquest and its almost as good, I also hope to read The White Dragon when I get done"
5,Dragonflight,I am a 14 year old male. I have just finnished Dragonflight.I read it at school. over all i think it is a really good book.Lessa is of ruatha blood her hold was concored by a greedy man named fax. After ten long turns of hiding and waiting for her day to come to get revenge on fax for killing her family.Then her day finally dose come but she decides to become wherladdy of the last wher left. Lessa gets a queen dragon and a mate named f'lar.f'lar his wing second f'nor lessa and every dragon rider are sworn to protect their beloved planet pern.but when the deadly silver threads start to fall after 400 turns. after the 4oo turns pern has few dragons leaft.so lessa hatches a plan to get many more dragons.but everyone must first fing that out and many more mysterys such as why have all the whers suddenly disappered 400 turns ago.
3,A Little Disapoited.,Dragonflight was ok if you can stand it when books are really slow in the beginning. After you get through all the boring stuff in the beginning of the book it was pretty good but it wasn't as good as I expected it to be. I wouldn't suggest anyone to read this book unless they are really into reading and can actually stand reading the whole book if it is boring in the beginning.
3,"Wonderful books, disappointing edition","I was excited to see these books available for the Kindle, and very much enjoyed re-reading them. That enjoyment was somewhat dimmed by the poor quality of the text - the typos flew fast and furious and occasionally there were sentences that ended up making no sense at all. Still, a bargain for the pleasure of revisiting old friends."
5,Dragons in danger of extinction on Pern...,"This novel introduces a lot of the characters who thread their way through Anne McCaffrey's other dragon books including F'lar, F'nor, Lessa and Robinton. The action takes place at a time when a lot of the wisdom of dragonkind has fallen in to myth and history, when holders feel safe and profitable, when Thread is a distant word that few believe in. A time when only one golden egg, incubator for a queen dragon, remains. All rests on the dragonriders finding a young woman who can meet the challenge of bonding with the new queen who can help increase their dwindling numbers. For a few people are convinced that Thread will soon fall from the skies, and dragons are the only way to fight this menace which haunts the planet of Pern..."

3,Dodo Greene,"Probably the only album available from Dodo Greene, a R&B; vocalist. A session from 1962, with great artists, such as Ike Quebec, Grant Green, Milt Hinton, etc.Recommendable."
3,Good reading,"I purchased this book because I recognized the title from who knows where, and it was on sale. I enjoyed it and it had some excellent moments, but reading the teaser pretty much laid out the entire plot. Very romantic, but in an innocent, giddy, easy way. Love the characters but it is a short, seemingly shallow read. I did explore the author's other titles, but I haven't read any of them- it seems she writes a novel for each character's love story and knowing that makes this book a bit more enjoyable because it hints at deeper recurring themes and hidden jokes that one would only get by reading all the books. The narration style was a little confusing right off the bat- a newspaper clip seems to be breaking the fourth wall and talking directly to the reader, and I had to read it a few times to realize the /characters/ were addressed as 'the dear readers', and it wasn't a prequel or anything. Other than that, very entertaining and a good short read."
3,Pretty good.,"I thought that this book was well written. I liked all the dialogue, and I really enjoy the family interaction in this book. I really did like Simon and Daphne as friends, but I don't think I could believe that they made good lovers.They way Simon lied to Daphne about conceiving children was awful. I understand he has some pretty big issues, but if he was going to be honest with her he needed to be totally honest.The way Daphne too advantage of Simon (Raped more like it) in order to get what she wanted was disgusting. I felt like at that moment they should just call it quits and move on. I really didn't want them together after that.I feel like they also lost a lot of the chemistry they had when they were pretending to court which was sad to see. It was the first romance novel where I felt that the hero and heroine should were better off friends.I have started the second book in this series today. I hope Anthony's story is better."
2,Dialogue gets in the way,"This is a sweet, enjoyable (if predictable) romance that suffers from inconsistent style in language. The characters often utter completely and obviously modern phrases that stick out in this historical."
2,That's Entertainment,"I don't know why, I do not keep Ms. Quinn's books, I love reading them and have read everyone she has written. ""The Duke and I,"" has humor, and it is a very easy read. This book has a little mystery and makes you think as you read. The characters are well developed as a matter of fact you can just about picture them as you read. Simon's speech problem was handled in a very realsitic way that made you feel sympathy and pride for how Simon accomplished this. I really like the inperfect characters. Daphne's ignorance added humor, which I liked and gave the story line a interesting twist. I know there will be sequels to this book, because the brothers were so well developed. I am very happy that Ms. Quinn writes so fast and we will not have to wait years to read the other books."
2,I expected better,"The book is funny, which is the only good thing I can say about it. The story was not something you could believe, the caracters weren't profound, the was too much manipulated to be good. I was expecting something better from this author. This was the first book I read from her, and I'm not planning in reading other ever."
2,"It's not okay, no matter who does it","I don't like rape in my romance. And getting a character drunk and taking advantage of them constitutes rape, in my book.If you read Regency romances for a more innocent worldview, even with a bit of passion, this is not that world. Not the world where people respect each other's wishes."
4,It was an interesting book,I would like to read all the Bridgerton family books. I was very entertained by this story and hope to ready more.
3,just OK,I read this book three days ago and I could barely remember what happened. This book is a cookie cutter romance story. Plot is predictable.
3,"Easy read, light entertainment","I read this book recently on holiday, and it is entirely suited to that purpose, a light holiday read. I don't usually read romance novels, and quite honestly didn't know this was one until the wedding night. That put me off a bit because it's just not my thing, I much prefer clean regency like Marion Chesney, but of course that's just my personal preference. The writing was fine, the plot predictable but entertaining and the characters mostly quite likable. I just didn't really care all that much, which was really the deciding factor in my three stars. It's not bad, but I doubt I'll read another in the series."
2,A disappointment...,"I enjoyed the first half of this story, but I was frustrated by the second half. I found the reasoning behind the Duke's behavior to be unbelievable and contrived. I also didn't believe that the super-independent heroine, who was raised around horses and stables, knew so little about ""where babies come from."" I don't care how sheltered you are, if you grow up around livestock, you don't have to have the facts of life explained to you!Quinn is a good writer, but the story's weaknesses were so weak, they really ruined my enjoyment of the book."
5,Fabulously funny!,"As usual, Julia Quinn has created a romance with delicious, laugh-out-loud humor and wonderfully realized characters. I adored Daphne and fell for Simon from the minute he appeared. You will, too!"
5,One of JulieQ's best,"Julia Quinn once again combines humor, friendship, and love to create a masterpiece. Simon and Daphne are an enjoyable couple who first find friendship and then love. The secondary characters are a hoot, especially Daphne's mother. And I have no doubt that you will love Daphne's brother's.Be prepared to put household chores and sleep on the backburner when you start this book, I did and was disappointed to see it end."
3,Los sucesores de Rush,"Encontramos en Ashland la fuerza del mas tradicional Rush, con nuevos aires de frescura en el sonido y destrezas individuales, tendran que trabajar un poco mas en la tematica de los CD para no caer en la obviedad. Es muy bueno para un comienzo.Para fanaticos de Rush lo recomiendo."
2,DigiMemo L2,"At first I could not down load the Manager soft ware on Vista, although on the box it said it was good for Vista. I downloaded the drivers from the web site...all was going good so I thought, however when I came to use the L2 pad I find that it is out of sync . When you go to write in the top left hand corner..it writes on the screen bottom left corner, then the bottom left is the bottom right and so on. I wrote to ""AceCad"" a week ago and they did not bother to reply, I would like to know if others have had this problem and how to fix it.Thank you."
3,Some ripped out,I purchased these along with some plastic pegs. These didn't stay in the fabric as well as the plastic ones. On a few corners these metal pins ripped out. I had to fold the fabric on corners to double it up in order to prevent the ripping up in a strong wind.
4,A melodic collection that borders a 90's version of mellow,"I was trying to figure out the best way to describe this CD. Perhaps Semisonic is too original to pigeonhole even though I had flashbacks of 70's groups like ELO, The Eagles and America. This band is not The Verve, Wallflowers, or Fastball. They are also not REM, fellow Mid- Northerners.What Semisonic has created in Feeling Strangely Fine is an immensely listenable collection of tunes that are orchestrated a little bit differently than other alternative bands. Each song is crisply arranged with plenty of electric or acoustic guitar-driven melodies. All that combined with the fact that Closing Time should probably win Song of The Year for 1998 presents a thoroughly enjoyable 50 minutes."
5,an unforgettable cd with all of the right grooves,"""Feeling Strangley Fine"" is a must-have for any music fan because it combines a welcome mix of catchy rock songs like ""Closing Time"" and ""This will be my year"" to thoughful ballads like ""DND"" and ""Gone to the movies"". It's the perfect cd to fit any mood, and it's one of those that you just can't take out of your cd player!"
3,Feeling strangely ordinary,"Semisonic will be just another notch in the US alternative-rock timeline. Following on from acts like Collective Soul, the Gin Blossoms and fellow Minnesotans Soul Asylum, this band doesn't bring anything new to the genre, which is why they fit so snugly with those mentioned bands. I do like a number of these songs, like 'California' which has an almost-mystical quality to it. I imagine it would sound best in someone's tape deck while on a lonely drive at night. And you'll like this album if you listen to a lot of Top 40 radio. There's nothing wrong with Semisonic. I can enjoy their music but there is nothing on this disc that keeps me going back for more and more...** 1/2 stars"
2,They got old fast,"I bought this cd thinking they were a really great band, which they are in a way. Semisonic has their own unique sound and I give them credit for that. The cd got old fast. I bought it and listened to a few times, now it's just collecting dust. The songs get old fast and it's music to fall asleep to. Like in Secret Smile (I can't believe they made a single for that song), ""Nobody knows it, nobody knows it, nobody knows it""...when is it ever going to end? I really liked them at first, but they are just one of those ""flavor of the month"" bands which will never be heard of again (examples: Harvey Danger, Nada Surf, Lit, Eve 6, and Blur)."
3,arrived broken - penny pinching bean counter at it again,"The sorter was exactly what I wanted, but it arrived broken. One of the dividers was loose. The problem was the short screws the manufacturer used to attach the dividers, it barely penetrated 1/4 inch into the pressboard divider. I reattched the divider using longer screws & at the same time replaced all the screws. Now it is perfect. Had they spent an extra .0001 cents per screw when it was assembled, I would have rated it a five."
1,Don't waste your money,"While these straps were cheaper than anywhere else on Amazon.com, they are a terrible product. They are extremely difficult to tighten down. Don,t waste your money, I used regular screw down, stainless clamps. They held tighter and were way cheaper."
2,Just O.K.,"After they're fully tightened they loosen up a little before they fully ""lock"" .They transmit a lot of heat when wrapped around the insulating material .Not buying them again ."
2,Broken!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I got this toy for 3 kings Day (a spanish holiday)and when I was putting it together for the first time the little peg you have to put in the horse broke! So much for the jumping part. Well I still had the cute Kerstie doll but the next day the dolls leg fell off! This is not a durable toy. Do not buy it!
3,Worthy Reference Book,"If you're looking for a blood and guts tale of the rich history of Greece, this isn't it. However it does seem authoritative and worth keeping on your shelf as a reference text. It reads more like a doctoral thesis, than a lively page-turner, but the main characters in modern Greek history were not bloodless, bland creatures, like Wooldrow Wilson, but tough politicoes, and you get no sense of personality in this book.If the author, Richard Clogg, had gone to Podunk State College instead of Cambridge, he might have been able to breath more life into his writing instead of sounding like the ""Enclopedia Brittanica""."
2,not the real thing,"I bought these recently after loving the ""real thing"" for a few years.When I say the ""real thing"" - I mean my original Hanes Tagless boxers that are 100% cotton and are marked ""Made is Thailand."" These are 75% cotton and 25% polyester and they just don't feel the same . (These say ""Made in Laos"")Also, the ""Tagless"" tag is SCRATCHY!!!! My old ones were not scratchy. It's the worst ever - a tag that is supposed to be comfortable, but it scratches you, and you can't cut it off because it's printed on the boxers! yikes!I'm looking now for the old style 100% cotton made in Thailand and when I find them I will stock up! (I guess they know how to print the non-scratchy tags in Thailand.)"
3,Hot,"I had a couple of pairs of these in all cotton and I loved them. These are comfortsoft but they are a poly blend, not ideal for underwear."
