1,very disappointed,"book was reconstructed upside down-- All the pages are backwards(must read from back to front---Very difficult to read.Your mail site screwed me & charged for 2 day when I was just checking out the cost.Book $6.00 Mail $ 12.00 ridiculous-I will get hosed once, but not a second timejerry gosland,"
1,PREDICTABLE AND BORING,"I didn't realize this movie would be a very poor, unoriginal attempt at remaking THE OMEN until I wasted what felt like endless hours watching it. Same basic plot, but with no added surprises. Stale characters, cheesy acting, and nothing remotely scary in the entire movie. In a word: DULL!"
3,Trying to Remake Classic Omen Movies....?,"Ok Movie....But what I wish they had was a soundtrack for this Movie. If anyone knows who Composed this Film, please tell Me."
3,lacking in quality,"I've used this product before, but the quality doesnt seem to be as good as what I remember. It seems cheaply made and I doubt it will last more than one season. In fact, I ordered three sets and of the six antennas that I received, two were already broken. Amazon has a great return policy so this wasnt an issue, however, the fact that 2 out of 6 antennas were already defective is not a good sign."
5,Billy Rose's JUMBO,"JUMBO is a great film that makes one long for a return to decency in motion pictures. Having seen this as a teenager in 1963, it was charming, then and now...Several tunes are standards. The DVD quality is excellent, plus fine special features !"
5,slide king supreme,"Sonny brings the Cajun slide style of electric blues to a new height with his current cd. Enthusiasts can argue on who is the best slide man touring and hands down, Sonny never disappoints. I recently worked with Lubos Novotny from Druha Trava, undoubtedly Euprope's greatest slide man...and we agree that Sonny's new edge puts another notch in American Southern Slide Blues. From start to finish, this is Sonny's best effort to date and his fans up North and in Eastern Europe are anxiously awaiting his new touring schedule. You can't go wrong with this artist and the long time a comin' for this new musical endeavor has been worth the wait. Go Sonny go!! richieSunshine Camp guitar teacher of the original ""kid johhny lang"
2,Disappointing,"Sonny is a true guitar god, and Outward Bound is a minor masterpiece, which is why I was shocked at how weak the songwriting was on this CD. It's hard to fathom why others rated it so highly."
1,No new information,"Most, if not all, of the information in the book could be found free on http://www.tivocommunity.com. If you find the information in Tivo Community difficult to understand you probably shouldn't be hacking your Tivo, and this book isn't worth $20."
2,Few Stand-Outs,"This anthology of stories featuring Marvel's mutant heroes, the X-Men, was a mixed bag of tales. I felt a number of the stories, while starting out well, fell flat in the final pay off pages; they seemed more like excuses to have a few interesting scenes.I'd recommend it only to the diehard X-Men fans. There are other better super-hero fiction anthologies out there."
2,Throw It Away,The book deserved 2 stars because it was a terrible book. I really didn't care for it. it is basically a bunch of short stories about people on how they don't fit in. Alot of it was untrue because people only act bad when they are not liked by others. I also think it deserved 2 stars because it had a bunhc of short stories and there is no boring parts in it. If it would of been a long book i dont think to many peple would be interested in it. Over all i think if somone get's the book they should through it away.
4,What You See Is What You Get,"This is a straight ahead video collection of ABC's videos from the 1980s. The sound is good and the video reproduction is OK.Like most videos from the 80s, ABC's work for the small screen improved as the decade wore on. However, the first video on the collection is ""Poison Arrow,"" directed by J.Temple, and much better than anything they did until the ""How to Be a Millionaire"" videos of the mid-80s. My favorites are ""Be Near Me,"" ""Vanity Kills,"" and ""When Smokey Sings.""The most disappointing video is ""Look of Love."" It was bad in 20 years ago and it's bad now. The final video, 1989's ""One Better World,"" is a good example of why the band faded away in the 1990s: it's just kind of boring.Don't expect any new stuff with this DVD. It's strictly the videos . . . no artists interviews, outtakes, or even liner notes.If you like ABC's hits, this is a great DVD to have. But even the biggest fans will be tempted to turn the TV monitor off and just listen to the music."
1,Saviours of Music?,"I have lost all respect for the writers of ""Rolling Stone"" for hailing this album to be the saviour of rock music. This album offers nothing new or powerful. Instead, you get a screaming fool with an afro, collapsing out on stage, trying to get your attention. The sad thing is the audience falling for this childish act. I saw them at the recent North X Northwest and was let down. Take away the stupid on-stage antics and you have very average music played by guys pretending their sixteen and in a wannabe cool punk band. The music industry is waiting for that one band that will take us into the future, clearly ATDI will only remind us of the past, not the future."
4,Gah the voice!,"Being a pretty big Mars volta fan I decided to check this album out, and at first listen I was horrified at the lead singers vacous non melodic excuses for a voice. I understand that the singing was actually collaborative work, but just listen to The Mars Volta and you'll be blown away by earnest beautiful talented singing and screeching. I suppose Bixler really found his true self/voice on tremulant. Most of the music on this album is brilliant, but is seriously, seriously marred by some of the droning vocals. After some time I decided to overlook this ""scar"" and focus on the music. I have to give this album 4 stars because it cannot be easily ignored, although at times you'll be shaking your head at the nonsense vocal workings."
4,Wonderful,"ROC is really a great rock album. I dont know how to explain it, but the mix of Cedric's incredible vocals and the jammin' guitars make up the songs, which are too infectious for their own good. If you're a new ATDI fan, I would recommend this first, the Vaya, then In/Casino/Out, and then Acrobatic Treatment. But this is truly a great album. (PS: Memo to Mikey, the lyrics are ""cut away, cut away"" not get away, go away. And, Taproot cant compare to these guys)"
5,Amazing,"At the Drive-In is an extremely talented band. While comparisons will be made to Rage Against the Machine, ATDI is completely original. When (or if) you figure out what the lead singer is saying, you will realize what true lyrical brillinace this band posesses. The guitar work is amazing. ATDI is capable of fast, adrenaline filled songs and also slower, almost eerie ballad types. The whole album is packed with so much energy and emotion. It is captivating from the first song to the last. Pure Genius."
1,Unadulterated Crap,This CD is so bad it's embarrassing. One star is too high a rating. I wouldn't wish this on my worst enemy.
3,pretty tight,"I'd heard that this band was totally killer, so I got Relationship of Command. A lot of the songs lived up to what I heard, but some it wasn't really for me. The singer gets too excited and into it for my taste. That sets off my emo alarm. There is very little emo that I enjoy, so the fact that I like this record as much as I do says something. If you really like punk and emo, you should defitnitely pick this up. I like the new band, The Mars Volta, with the two dudes from this band that have afros. They took some of the grand, spacey sounds from At the Drive-In (the parts I like) and ran with it.I would venture to say that, no matter your taste, you should check out Relationship of Command by this band or Tremulant ep by The Mars Volta. One (or both) of the records is guaranteed to connect with you. These guys are talented."
4,Wish they still existed...,"...but then again, that would mean The Mars Volta wouldn't. I actually discovered At The Drive-In because I'm a huge Mars Volta fan. I really like the sound they had, and even may have preferred the singing style in ATDI (too much falsetto weirdness in TMV sometimes). These are some really great rock songs, and as musicians, they are very talented. My only complaint is that it sounds like this album could have used a bit more production. Don't get me wrong, I love the raw sound, but at times things sound out of tune, the harmonies don't quite harmonize just right, and the dynamics could have been a bit more dynamic. That's the only reason I don't give this 5 stars."
4,surprisingly as good as the hype,"I'm usually not one to give in to the hype surrounding bands, but the insistent buzz kept bothering me so I bought the cd without even hearing it. At first the cd sounded a lot like sonic youth crossed with rage, but it kept growing on me, and like some other reviewers said, once I started playing it I couldn't stop. I must admit I care more for the first song than the singles. Arcarsenal is unbelievable. Short, sweet and wonderful. Can't wait to see what they turn out next."
5,Buy this sucker now!,"I don't write many reviews, but I had to give you my two cents...This album will blow you away!! I'll admit that this was my first ATDI album but what an intro! The vocals are raw the guitars are crunching and the drums don't let up. It's fast and will hit you like a punch in the face...get it now!"
3,"I've read this book a long time ago, but the remembering is good","I've read this book several years ago, in 1998, I think. It was my first glimpse on software project planning. At the time, I was a bit confusing, the book has a lot of examples of very big projects. But the best practices it provides are useful until today.Don't know if it's a good book nowadays, but it's definitely a book I won't forget."
2,orgininal length,"I just wish the dvd would have been the original 151 minute version. If they ever release the true version of this movie I would purchase it. As of now, I will just watch it on TCM at the 121 minute edited version."
4,What's with the snakes and cats????!!!!,"I liked this group of books WITH THE EXCEPTION of the ""she hissed"" and ""he hissed"" and ""they hissed"" Are these people in the throes of love makeing, or at a snake and/or cat fight. EVERY ONE of these books that I have read so far (4) has the heroine and hero ""hissing"". Buy this author a thesaurus!"
5,One of my all time favorites,This is one I have re-read a number of times and every time I fall in love with Sin all over again. What a hero. The h is also fabulous and lovable. Highly recommended
2,Ugh,"Although this book takes on an interesting idea, the book is poorly executed. The dialogue feels flat and unrealistic (set more in current day US than in either England or Scotland), the hero and the heroine are unbelievable and the plot feels empty. I forced myself to read until roughly 90% done and then couldn't bring myself to finish. This was a waste of 7.99 (what I paid for the kindle version) and it was vastly unsatisfying. Those are a few hours of my life that I'll never get back...."
4,"Penderecki, a contemporary composer","This production is interesting. Penderecki is among the few serious composers of the twentieth century that do not shock the listener. His music is innovative without being hard to digest. The composer explores the capabilities of the viola, oboe, and flute. While watching and listening, one realizes that the potentials of these instruments have not been exhausted by the classicists and romantics. The reason why Penderecki's music is beautiful is that it is both experimental and accessible to audience. This would be a good DVD for music lovers who would like to experience a taste of contemporary music. Kultur would do us a great service if they produce more contemporary works. It is a pity that the 20th century music is still largely ignored by music lovers and orchestras."
4,CD Rack,Not bad but sorta hard to put together with trying to line up all the dowel rods... But holds alot of CD's and moounts nicely to the wall...
4,Bedford hours,"The book provides 27 beautiful full page colour photos for the viewer to enjoy. There are also black and white examples, all on good quality paper which helps reveal the quality and detail of each page. There is some description and history but I feel the book is mostly for the pictorial display. I am very pleased with this book and it is well worth the money. It enhances my modest library of Medieval Manuscripts."
2,Deffinitly a selection for beginners,"The author positions the book as a IP numbering system for enterprize networks and it is not. Graham spends half of the book explaining what an IP datagram is and what it is used for and the other half of the book is very basic IP numbering theory. Basically if your in charge of the ip numbering of an ""Enterprize Network"" and anything in this book is new to you then your in over your head."
2,"Informative, yet self-aggrandizing","The validity of Ressler's information is automatically questionable considering he seems to use this book as a way to get back at his former colleagues with the BSU. I found myself laughing at times when he gives himself considerable amounts of credit for progress in a case or his repeated claim of coining the term ""serial killer"". This inflated sense of self takes away from all the information that the book provides. The interviews with Gacy and Dahmer are interesting. However, I wonder how accurate they are because Ressler seems so concerned about looking smart and good at what he does. It is apparent that he has something against John Douglas, who is the guy you should be reading anyway."
4,Get In Touch With Your Inner Psychopath,"Granted, Ressler rants on a bit about his personal achievements, and I do not really care for his stories of his struggle with FBI red tape; the book also comes a bit short on the psychological aspects of the subject matter. On the upside, I found this book an easy - to - read introduction to the world of serial killers and profiling. Much as I hate to admit it, violence IS entertaining -- this book beats many pulp fiction thrillers in that aspect, and it is educational too. Recommended."
2,gum good-presentation awful,"The gum showed up in a big blue trash bag. No type of packaging to ensure gum freshness. Also are taking their word that it is 25 pounds. I weighed the gum and came up with about 22 pounds. Doesn't seem like that big a deal until you figure out they are charging .04 cents/piece of that little bitty gum. Overall not overly impressed with this product or the price, but can't find this product anywhere else. Anyone know of a different place?[...]"
3,Good product poor packaging,Contents spilled out of the blue kitchen bag that it was packed in and went all over inside the packing box. Had to scoop it all out. Good gum tho and a decent price.
4,book saved us thousands of dollars,"My husband and I made a bid on a foreclosed property. The same night I ordered ""Be Your Own Home Renovation Contractor."" We read through the book when it arrived and because of the tips and expert advice of the author, we were able to spot major (hidden)defects in the house that would have cost us thousands of additional dollars to repair. Needless to say, we did not buy the foreclosure. We have since found another house and again, we have saved money using the author's tips and techniques."
1,There are better books on this topic...,"This was not helpful for me, written like a 3-step plan that was quite general and steeped in old ideas"
4,"unusual, interesting, dreamlike terror....",I enjoy watching a good thriller and decided on this video. Pay attention as there are alot of twists and turns to this very strange little tale of a young British boy and his adventures in the world of grown-ups and what you think is real is often not the case. Mystery and Psychological suspense to say the least! They don't make movies like this anymore.
3,Speedy delivery,"I got the book really quick,but for what I paid I wish it was not written in; all the underlining made it a little distracting."
3,Major Flaws in What Could Have Been a Great Novel,"The Second Coming held my interest and I enjoyed reading it, even though it did drag a little sometimes. The strength of the novel was Percy's portrayal of the disaffection I imagine many affluent and ""successful"" Americans feel. But I have to subtract at least one star for what one reviewer called the author's ""lecherous fantasy"" (truly troubling) and another for the ending that seemed rushed and not believable."
4,Very interesting article,If you want to know about Coney Island history and evolution I strongly recommend this book. It presents how Coney Island became the Coney Island. It is also sheap so you don't have to spend a lot to enjoy this book!!
2,General Review Information - Bad Proofing,"My issue with this book is that it has numerous technical mistakes, and contridictions. Obviously was not proof read by anyone technical."
4,"It's an Exam CRAM, not a textbook!","Good book to review for ACRC exam -- I used this book the weekend prior to taking the exam and passed with flying colors. This book is intended for review, and you won't get a full course out of it, but if you already have some hands on and need some concentrated study, this is a great resource!"
4,An excellent score to an equally good movie!,"I'm one of few teenage Pokemon fanatics, and the first time I saw this movie, I fell in love with the score. I was so pleased at how well it was done! From the sweeping themes of The Birth of Mewtwo, to the sad, peacefullness of Tears of Life, this score shines. And, in my book, it definitely beats the vocal soundtrack any day!"
4,A great book for preschoolers,"This crazy combination of reality and fantasy mix to make a great story that my two preschoolers have loved since we've owned the book. My son and my daughter can easily relate to the balls that call to them to be ""opened"" and the mayhem that ensues.The brightly colored pictures grabbed their attention right away, but the story is what truly steals the show. It was very easy for a 2 and 3 1/2 year old to understand the frustration of the balls and the frustration of the main character who's trying to think.A quick and easy read that your children will enjoy!"
2,Not great!,"I bought this thinking it was penlike size and because it was black, but unfotunately it is bigger than expected and was a red one. When I ordered it there was no option to choose color so I assumed it was black like in the picture, bad service. I recommend anyone who wants to buy this send an e-mail to seller first asking what color options they have."
1,Still waiting,"I ordered this item 10/29/10 - and now it is 6th December 2010 - and I still have not yet received my order.That is over 5 weeks ago. And there has been no contact or information relating to the order being sent. So, ""NO stars"" at this stage."
2,a mediocre book,"While an important and little written about topic, this book fails to deliver the valuable information in a readable manner. The language is dull and boring, and the writing is dry. It is very difficult to sit with it for an extended period of time. While the author attempts to address critical issues in Mexican architecture he over complicates the relevant information with the rhetoric.The noble attempt to provide dialogue with influencial authorities on the subject by way of interviews seemed tainted. This was because his questions were not open ended and were often worded in a leading manner. It was as if the author was trying to draw out the response he desired from the subject.While Burian's writing was lacking, some of the articles written by others contained in the book were more appealing."
5,Awesome,"""Corazon Adentro"" made me cry and has become my ""theme"" song!!I love this CD. And ""Medeley"" Absolutely and totally ROCKS. This is my Second Albita CD and I want more stuff like this on my CD rack. This Just rocks."
1,not what you want,"In addition to the strap holders falling apart, you'll find that these have a tendency to rotate around your shin through regular use. This causes you to have to stop every 2 minutes to readjust."
2,dissapointed!,"I bought this cd just because i had bought the 3 previous!And i must admitt,though i don't want it,that i was dissapointed.Vol.4 hasn't got that...heroic music of Vol.1&2,or the mystic and dark music of Vol.3.I recognised Mr.LoDuca's style,but i was dissapointed.I think that a cd like X:WP Vol.6 must be created for Hercules too.A cd that will contain cues that weren't included in the other cd's.I will keep the cd as a treasure,just like i always do with Xena and Hercules cd's,but i won't listen to it that often.Thanks."
1,Its not for dummies,"It was a choice between Sams and Dummies. I choose dummies because it was the latest (4.51) and for dummies. When I read it though, it wasn't for dummies. I was looking for more of a step by step this is how you do it kind of book. Instead, it was mostly describing what certain things do without giving a real clear step by step this-is-how-you-do-it. Now I have to go back and buy another Homesite book because this wasn't what I expected at all. If you know what you're doing, then this is for you. I've used frontpage and am fine with it, but this book was way too advanced and general for me."
1,no value adding book,"All topics in this book are already covered in ""The Strategy Focused Organisation"". ""Strategy Maps"" says the same, but with five times as many words. A real disapointment. The book is complete crap. Read ""The Strategy Focused Organisation"" instead, that one is really good.Theres is a lot about measures in ""Strategy Maps"", but it won't give you much guidance.Examples from different kinds of service providers and manufacturing are overrepresented. There are basically no examples from other kinds of businesses."
5,"Very dense, academic language but very well written","Must admit I haven't read all of it, because the language is so dense and thick with academic meaning, but this is a really great title, and a must read for anyone serious about Critical Lit Analysis."
3,"Star Trek VI the Undiscovered Country is a good movie, but......","Star Trek: VI the Undiscovered Country is a good movie but It's single disk edition. The Special features are not so special. I think the bonus Material in this DVD is low quality. If your able to find the Star Trek VI: Undiscovered Country two-disk special edition I will recommend that over this one. I like the film but the DVD transfer is terrible. Don't buy it unless you have never seen this Star Trek movie which is the final farewell to Star Trek:the Original Series. The Original Star Trek cast will be missed. William Shatner, Leonard Nimoy, Deforest Kelly,Walter Koenig, Nichelle Nicholes, James Doohan, and George Takei. I like this movie but the DVD transfer is terrible. C"
4,Great collection,"This thick volume offers a great collection of Hebrew poetry spanning 2.5 millennia or more. The poetry itself is wonderful, and the editor(s) did a good job of selecting the works to be included. Some of the poems are not included in their entirety, however. The English translations are pretty good but expansive, with quite a few “explanatory”words and phrases added in for the sake of readers who don’t understand the Hebrew. If you do understand the Hebrew, you may scratch your head at the English from time to time because of these glosses. My biggest complaint about the volume, and the reason for only 4 stars instead of 5, is that the small print on newsprint-type paper makes the Hebrew sometimes blotchy and occasionally difficult to read, especially when it comes to distinguishing tsere from patach. But overall, I love this volume and appreciate the editors and Penguin for publishing it!"
4,"What's not to like, it had a plot!","I put off reading the series after the third book for two years because of the bad reviews. I wish I hadn't because this one was pretty good. It had a plot unlike the second book that was two people running around. I thought the action was fine. The only mistake was one of the Demons goes back to LA, but it really doesn't explain how he could get back to Orcus. The main character has a lot of growth. She's always been a fighter and even when she wants to give up, she can't. Even when she's raped, she can get over it because she is a fighter with a very violent upbringing. The part where she meets up with her baby's daddy is somewhat disjointed."
4,refills,No complaints other than the price. These have an extra lining to reduce chances of kitty surprises soaking through. :)
4,Handy when going on vacation,"At an average of $20 a cartridge, I purchased the Forever Litter Tray, which has saved me a small fortune in litter...I do find these worth the price when going on vacation and someone else needs to change the litter. However, with 2 cats, these cartridges only last about a week."
1,absolutely does not perform - 0 stars,"These litter trays and the self-scooping box they come with absolutely do not perform. The trays do NOT hold liquid, urine, creating a nightmare mess. HUGE RIPOFF!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,It gets the job done alright.,"The Scoop Free automatic box costs me about $12 mth for the refill litter cartridge (negative.) The litter comes in the form of blue crystals. They work very well for odor control and deters from cat litter tracked onto the floor. however, the crystals come in a disposible cartridge that is made out of cardboard....my cat scratches right through this. When I go to dispose of the cartridge, I notice urine has sometimes leaked through onto the floor (due to the cat nails.)"
3,Pricey but good,"The 3 pack for these liners are well constructed. I wish I hadn't bought the scoop machine though. I dump the waste every week and replace the liners (because of their cost) whenever needed (sometimes every 2 months). I do have 2 cats that eat only canned food (they have all kinds of food allergies) so consequently, they do not use the scoop away machine too often."
5,Great animation,"I have always loved this film..........nice to have it in my collection of DVDs. Very funny and entertaining, try it, you'll like it"
4,Yellow Submarine,"A really clean, crisp copy of the movie, great colors. I bought it for the sound track and the sound is excellent."
1,poor movie!,This movie has nothing interesting or attractive! Classical cop story with bad acting and scenario. Not worth to watch!
2,Handle too short!,Brush has very soft bristles; maybe too soft. The handle is too short and it is awkward using the brush because of this. Prompt delivery.
4,Really great for people who are just starting out!,"I love these face cleansing brushes and this is a perfect one for people who aren't sure if they will be using a brush or not. I now use a Dermologica one that is a bit stiffer and has a longer handle, but I still use this brush when I'm taking off my face masks. It's a great starter for young girls who are just starting out in skincare because it's so much fun to use! I would definitely recommend this to anyone."
2,The Original is Better,"I love the soundtrack to this movie, but I only had the soundtrack on tape (which is nearly worn out). I was looking to get it on CD and opted to try this version. I wish I'd listened to the other comments that said the original was better. This version seems ""tinny"" and empty; it lacks the richness of the original. I still prefer listening to my cassette over this CD, and I'm looking to buy a copy of the original on CD."
3,Should have bought the movie soundtrack.,"Not nearly as lush a sound as the movie soundtrack. The orchestra is very good with the fiddle/violin parts as you would expect of a Scottish orchestra, but the overall depth of sound is disappointing."
1,Cheap Remake for Capital?,The remake of the origional soundtrack was extremely dissapointing. The voicing of the insturments is incorrect. The drumming on the intro is annoying. All these elements distract me from the feeling that I get from the origional soundtrack. It is my opinion that the remake was made by a orchestra somewhere that saw an opportunity to make some money by fooling customers into thinking that they are buying the origional soundtrack. That is not uncommon in our profit obsessed culture. Don't be fooled.
2,the original soundtrack was better,"This version of the soundtrack lacks the richness and depth of the original release. If you can find the first one, buy it! This one is an okay substitute but clearly of a lesser quality, sounding tinny and one-dimensional in many places. It also pulls out much of the original celtic music by Clannad and Dougie MacLean -- these are significant losses."
5,"No, I don't think it's actually DUMB.",I don't the slightest bit think it's dumb. I think it stops those stupid my scene losers from getting their own way. Plus I'm NOT fighting. Leave me alone. It's none of your business.
4,Very nice,"I don't really see how much a child could really gain from this doll...especially since 'May Lin' is a Chinese name, and she is supposed to be from Japan. ;)She's very pretty just the same, and since I have a major respect for Japanese culture, I keep her as a tribute to my love of the country on my desk."
3,Are these Winks Dolls ????,"WINKS CLUB DOLLS ARE BEST...FOR PROGRESSIVWE MATURITY. MORE IMAGINATION. MY CHILDREN HAVE SO INFORMED ME. You are advertising this product withbackup manufacturing info.!!! This info is needed for better knowledge for parents. I AM A GRANDMOTHER LOOKING FOR WINKS CLUBS DOLLS ... YOU DO NOT SPECIFY IF THESE ARE WINKS CLUB DOLLS OR NOT. THEREFORE I CANNOT RATE YOUR DOLLS AS HIGHLY AS I WOULD RATE WINKS CLUB DOLLS, AS WINKS DOLLS ARE 5 STAR DOLLS. PLEASE CLARIFY.THANK YOU. COPPELIOUS, DOLL MAKER"
1,What were they THINKING!?!?!?!?,"Okay yeah,she's a pretty doll but if you've lived in Japan off-base for 3 years like i have you'd know that kimonos ARE NOT NEON!!!!!!!!!!!!WHAT WERE THE DESIGNERS THINKING!!!!!?????!!!!!this doll is NOT EDUCATIONAL oh, and the obi(belt)DOES NOT TIE IN THE FRONT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!do NOT get this for your child. if the clothes aren't right, it's not Tokyo!!!(P.S JAPANESE PEOPLE WEAR MODERN CLOTHES!!! IT ISNT THE 1200S!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,Nice history but no plans,I bought this book because I thought he would expand on his bench design from Fine Woodworking. No such luck. This book is basically a history of wood working benches and some vague schematics of different kinds of benchs. As a coffee table book this is 5 stars but as guide for making your own bench it is only three stars.
5,MADE MUCH EASIER,This book is very helpful in the understanding of the DSM-IV. I have found the case vignette very helpful. However I have found certain parts of the DSM-IV more helpful. After reading the DSM IV then using the DSM IV Made easy compliment the book and helps you completely understand the books. I recommend this book to help any person who needs to read and understand the DSM IV.
1,Hate it!,I would rather we used the real DSM but it was required for class so have to go along. i don't find it as easy to use as the real thing is and the real thing is cheaper too. So I don't have alot of good to say about it. Sorry.DSM-IV Made Easy: The Clinician's Guide to Diagnosis
1,Funniest book I have ever read,"I purchased this book for a buck when I was in graduate school. I am sad that I have lost it because it was the funniest book I have ever read! The figures seem to be haphazzardly placed with little connection to the text (the picture of George Washington in his Masonic get-up has no relevance that I could find). The book was bold in naming a date which, unfortunately for book sales at this point, has come and gone. This is appropriate light reading that always leaves you chuckling."
3,Good coverage of the subject - whether you believe it or not,"I really enjoyed the book seeing that I am a great Graham Hancock fan. Mr. Noone has a great ability to present a wealth of facts about the great pyramid.Whether you believe that the ultimate disaster will strike earth on 5/5/2000 or not, it is a book well worth reading, even if it is just to wonder about the amazing facts around the great pyramid.There is no doubt in my mind that the great pyramid was build on the earth to carry a message through time. What the message is: We can only quess???"
2,Ok but a little odd,"As a lover of yoga I quickly bought the first prenatal yoga video I saw the day I found out I was pregnant.I just wasn't happy with this video. I find myself stopping to fast forward through the chanting and the ""free dance"" part of this video much too often to get a nice rythmn going.The instuctor was much to ""new age"" for my taste and more over the top then I have ever encountered in previous yoga tapes and instructors.The only part I felt was helpful was the leg strenghtening exercises, but not a good enough video for those that are more experienced and looking for a better workout."
1,Hate this video,I do a lot of videos workouts - this has got to be one of the worst. I have a background in dance and have practiced yoga for years. I found a few of the exercises not explained well for a beginner and can potenetially hurt your lower back. I'm also not into all the chanting - I like yoga for stretching and relaxing - there are much better pre-natal yoga tapes out there that I like much more.
1,should be called dancing and chanting,"I agree with other reviewers that this is not yoga as I have ever practiced it. You won't see a familiar yoga posture in this DVD, but will instead sway to and fro. The other annoying thing is the jerky camera work, and non-stop talking by the instructor about getting in touch with your ""primal self."" She also states several amusing facts like how ""womens' bones float in the pelvis"" and how our baby is ""directly connected to our pituatary gland."" There is also a considerable amount of chanting, which I really can do without. Skip this DVD if you want yoga, and get Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea."
2,Too nutty for me,"This workout helped alleviate my back pain, but I still wouldn't recommend it, mainly because the wacky instructor is so distracting! She talks incessantly in a breathy voice (think Julie Hegarty in ""Airplane"") about the goofiest things. When she asked viewers to ""imagine squatting in the forest 1,000 years ago"" I had to stop exercising and laugh for a bit. Really ridiculous stuff.Plus I was disappointed that she didn't concentrate on form at all. I think a responsible instructor would give more attention to breathing techniques, alignment,and proper form to help prevent knee and back injury. Luckily, I had already taken classes with a more conventional instructor, so I knew a bit about this. Other viewers might not be so lucky.As long as I've already paid for this, I'll probably continue to use it. But I'll turn on the mute and fast forward through the goofy chanting from now on."
4,This Video is a Natural Childbirth Must!,"I credit this video (and live pre-natal yoga classes with Gurmukh in L.A.) with not needing an epidural or any pain medication for my first child's birth. Lead by the original pre-natal yoga teacher, her technique of exercise, breathing and vocalization really helps you get physically and emotionally ready for having a baby. It helped me be strong, relaxed and unafraid of the experience so I didn't fight the contractions; I rode them out. Your baby will thank you for using this video to prepare yourselves. The live acoustic music was a big plus for me."
1,This video leaves much to be desired.,"I have exercised using Yoga before so this was not my first experience with it but come on, can we say light the incense bring in the finger cymbols and lets all chant! When you are pregnant you want to do something that is going to make you relax, become more pliable yet somehow energize you, this video is definitely not it!!!"
5,This video helped me greatly.,"I laughed at how ""L.A."" this video is, but the more spiritual aspects of it didn't bother me at all. In fact, I found that the chanting, visualization, dancing and meditation parts were ultimately as useful (if not more so) than the physical stuff. This video manages to be both relaxing and physically challenging at the same time. I was in labor for 18 hours and -- partly because of the mental and physical confidence I gained from this video -- I gave birth without any drugs or medical intervention."
1,NOT YOGA!,"This dvd is really bad. I didn't believe the reviewers who said it was too new-agey and goofy, but I wish I did. I have no problem with the concept of new-age, or even a teacher in a turban, but my biggest complaint is that this was NOT YOGA! It's some kind of random assortment of movements (not poses) designed to ""massage your baby."" I could have made this up on my own. Go for the YOGA ZONE: Postures for Pregnancy instead -- it's real yoga with careful instructions and a good (not overdone) attitude."
1,Not happy.,I was not at all happy with this video. The instructor seemed like a joke and all of the chanting was rediculous. I was very sore for a few days after and dont feel like most of the excercises are fit for a pregnant woman.
4,"""out there"", but good","I definitely agree that this video is a little bit ""out there"". The woman leading it wears a turban, there is chanting, there is a ""free form"" section. However, for someone who has never done yoga before, I found it to be an easy-to-follow, enjoyable workout. I tried other videos and the aerobics got my feet all twisted and the other yoga videos were too structured for someone who didn't know any poses. If you are looking specifically for pregnancy yoga poses and already know some yoga, this might not be the video for you. If you're looking for a fun, relaxing workout, this could be it."
4,amazing stress relieveer during last trimester!!,"I used this video daily during my last trimester when I was no longer able to jog and lift weights. Not only did I not suffer any back pain (Despite the fact that I went three weeks over my due date), but I never experienced any swelling in my legs or ankles. My goal was a natural labor and this video showed me how to breath and relax. The instruction is very clear and this is an easy video to follow. Perfect at the end of the day."
1,Not worth the money,"There were printing and binding errors, considering the cost this should not be. But much worse is that there appear to be technical errors (differences from the Dragon association teachings) but those could be a direct result of the binding errors, I can't really say as I couldn't easily get beyond the binding problems.Can't say a whole lot more."
1,way too expensive!,I thought I would be getting more than one plate for the price of $6.40... what a rip off! I have found this same plate on other sites now for $3-$3.50..... I am very disappointed... usually Amazon has competitive prices... but not in this case.I would look else where for a better deal!
3,Bought it due to one song only.....,"I bought this CD because of the one song, ""Nothing's Gonna Change My Love for You"", a song that hit number one. Only had it on vinyl and wanted it on CD. However, I do not know the rest of the songs on this CD."
5,Give us more,"The Darling Buds of May is just wonderful. Beautiful British Kent countryside, wonderful acting and a family that is funny and tugs at your heartstrings. Wonderful viewing for the whole family."
3,High Energy Music But Alittle Mindless,"Good high energy music, but it doesn't always fit with a fairy tale. Fairy tales of today are sure different than yesterday's more innocent tales.When I took my nine year old to the concert, I felt a little embarassed that the music was just a bunch of teenage angst/pop stuff, and not music appropriate for a fairy tale..then again, Schrek is very DIFFERENT!"
5,The CD is great. But the focus is on the MAGNET!,"Folks, what Amazon doesn't emphasize is the true gem of this package. No, not the CD. Yea, you guessed it. The magnet. Put it on your fridge, your computer, or even your ride and I guarantee you that in a few weeks you will notice drastic changes in your love life. Know why? Cause this magnet should actually be called a ""chick magnet"". After I stuck this bad boy on my bumper, all the fly honeys were asking me for my 7."
1,Sorry - this book sucked,"I bought AN ALIEN LIGHT by Nancy Kress because she mentioned it in one of her How-To-Write books.I love Sci-Fi, so I thought I would learn a thing or two from this book. Unfortunately, I hated it.Poorly written through and through is my only comment."
1,Horrible printing,"I'm terribly disappointed with this textbook. It looked like copies were made from copies of copies of the hardback version on an office copy machine. (No, I did not accidentally put too many 'copies' in that last sentence.) Some of the pages were crooked and the text quality was very poor. I expect a lot more for $170. This was not a single copy problem. I exchanged my first copy for a second one that was just the same. In the end I rented a hardback copy from elsewhere."
3,UHC/LPR Telescope Filter,"This filter performs fairly well and does increase contrast. It does not work as well as I expected, but does help in Light Polluted areas."
5,Excellent First Hand Account!,"This book is an excellent first hand account of Indian life in the 1700s in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Heckewelder was a Moravian missionary and spy for General Washington in the Ohio country during the Revolutionary war. He goes into great detail about everyday Indian life and how they interacted with other tribes as well as the early settlers. He writes as a reporter of Indian life, what he say & heard between 1762 and 1813 during his extensive travels in early Ohio country (including Marietta, Gallipolis, Cincinnati, Detroit, Pittsburgh and the Moravian Indian towns in Tuscarawas County, Ohio)"
4,Organic Salsa!,"I attended a Wayne Gorbea concert, and it is one of the most memorable. I purchased this CD afterwards and have enjoyed it very much. Some of the tempos are medium, and I love that about this CD. The musicians are top notch, and the vocal work is to my liking. I give each song a 4 star rating, and I highly recommend it, you won't be disappointed."
1,Yecch! The heft and look and feel and sound of plastic,"This seemed like such a good idea! The right size rather than a monster plate, lightweight, but glass not plastic, inexpensive. Sorry to say, it feels and looks and sounds like melamine. If I used these plates, I would always have to be reminding guests that although they felt and looked like plastic, they were glass and therefore non-toxic. I'd rather not apologize for my dinnerware, and I'm not a snob, but no one wants the toxins heat releases in plastic, and I would have to make sure guests knew I was careful of their health if I served dinner on these plates. Yecch! We have so many products that look and feel great, yet are toxic. Here's one that's chemically inert, perfectly safe, yet looks and feels like trash."
3,An o.k. post natal workout,"I was a little disappointed in this workout. First of all, I really didn't like the long verbal introduction to yoga by the instructor. Also, I felt a video like this should have a new Mom as an instructor like most post natal workout videos do. The yoga is very boring. I did like the infant massage section at the end of the video and the section where you get to dance with your baby. Honestly, I would get Post natal Pilates instead, it is a shorter and better workout; or or Post natal excersize for Mom and Baby."
1,Terrible video,"This should be called ""Mommy does yoga while baby rests on a blanket nearby."" As mentioned by other reviewers, the instructor didn't even have a baby with her, and she doesn't pretend to acknowledge the presence of babies for more than 10% of the video. Most of the poses she offers are things that can't (or shouldn't) be done holding a baby, and she doesn't even bother to suggest how one can incorporate the child in the routine. On second thought, it should be called ""Mommy ignores crying baby while doing yoga."" Terrible, terrible video. Shame on this company for trying to market it as a mommy and me offer - aren't new moms subjected to enough marketing ploys??"
1,this is a waste of money,"What is this?? I have disliked Alanis Morissette for years, and this CD makes it worse. Wow, this really is a waste of money. Don't buy it. The first time you hear it, you know it's a waste of money!"
4,Loads of fun!,"I got this game for cheap, so I didn't have high expectations. But it's been a lot of fun.Each map gives you certain objectives and a selected group of troops to start with. The idea seems to be having your troops work together, but I found that to be a pain. While you try to control one soldier the others won't stay put. They run around, get in the way, and often get hurt. I usually park most of my troops in a corner, vehicle or building and complete the mission with one or two of them.Almost everything in the game is destructible, and there always seems to be plenty of heavy weapons and extra ammo lying around. This is a great game to play after a stressful day at work. I just crank the speakers up and blow the heck out of everything.The graphics and sound are pretty darn good, and the gameplay is a blast. I really enjoyed this game."
2,BAD Interface and BAD Game,"The two stars are only for its graphics.If Company of Heroes rate 4.5/5 this game rates 2/5.Except for Graphics, the rest of the game is BAD.The interface is clunky.You cannot save your missions, you cannot exit and resume."
1,NOT A SENSOR!!!!!,This is NOT a sensor. this is the cardboard spacer only! DON'T ORDER IT. again THIS IS NOT A SENSOR
3,Some good info but lacks a compelling narrative,"I was disappointed in this book because it focuses on stories of individual gangsters, but lacks a good compelling overall view.It's a collection of chapters on various characters from the NY underworld up to around 1935.I was hoping for a more unified approach that would develop the subject as a whole, while fitting in individual narratives where needed. However, it's like reading a collection of vignettes. It has some interesting info, but left me disappointed. I would have liked to have seen a better collection of photos."
3,Non-conclusive,"...As a concerned human being, I like to believe that salvation is near. To that end I am searching for the true kingdom, which is how I stumbled on Mr. Creme's writings. This book failed to convince me of the legitimacy of Creme's teachings. The writing was mediocre at best.However, I decided to give Mr. Creme another chance and I attended his talk in San Francisco on July 29, 2001. Again he failed to convince me, repeating the same ...that is contained in his books and on his website. The talk like his book was done as a matter-of-factly with little attempt at convincing the non-believers.The session also included ""channeling of energy"" by the Masters to the audience through Mr. Creme. This consisted of Mr. Creme staring at the audience during a long period of silence. We were told that he would not be blinking, but it was hard to tell as the lights were dimmed. I found this to be pure showmanship, and not becoming of the true Kingdom. Non-conclusive."
3,Get me a pillow,"This CD is straightforward bore-core. I was so bored while listening to this CD the first time that I just had to change the CD, and pop in some Desultory (...). Old school metal is the best, but Grave's style is definately... horrible. I don't know why the hell I even bought this CD, and by the way, has anybody but me noticed that this CD lacks bass? It sounds as if the bass player's track just got left behind and out of this recording in general... not a sign of a good CD.I'm a huge fan of swedish metal, but these guys just plain old suck. I have to tell you, the bonus CD that came with this worthless piece of plastic was better than the CD I bought. It has way much more music on it, it's raw, and it's actually creative.I strongly suggest that you don't buy this CD. But if you can, try to just find the bonus CD somewhere (off a friend, ebay, anywhere) and listen to that instead. It's far better than the other one..."
3,"Lots of information, but cluttered","This is the textbook for an ECE course I'm taking online. The book is packed with information--perhaps too much. It has a cluttered look to it that gives me a confused feeling when I'm reading it. It is however a great ""coffee table"" book because it has nice photos, tons of charts, diagrams and graphs and side notes--ON EVERY PAGE. But for a textbook, there has to be a better one out there that's more readable yet still includes the necessary information."
2,not happy,"the book was cheap and had all the pages, but it was dirty, taped together, and highlighted to death....""used"" shouldnt mean ""close to trash"".......you guys need to screen your partners a little better, or maybe i was a random bad case, anyway, im never ordering from firsttrust_books again......and i couldve sworn i ordered the 7th edition, not the 6th...ughk"
5,"If you plan on having a child, READ THIS BOOK! (Maybe Outdated)","Book was very easy to read and comprehend. If you are taking developmental psych, I recommend investing in this book. Because its a earlier edition, I had a bit of a time locating all the material. I believe the editors moved alot of material around in the more current edition. OH! If you are planning to have children, read this. I am still without a child, but I learned so much even in the 1st 2 chapters. LOVED IT"
4,For nostalgia buffs,"This is a nice collection of the classic TV show. It includes the ""origin"" show. The reproduction is good. These will likely only be of interest to people old enough to remember the original show. By modern standards they are incredibly hokey and provide an ultra romanticized version of the Wild West, including stereotypes of Native Americans that are unimaginable today. The show was noteworthy for its lack of killing. They were, however, quite the thing for kids to watch in the early days of TV. There is some humor value in watching them, but also a rather warm fondness for their simple plots and predictable outcomes."
4,Great video,Very high quality for black and white. No problems with the video. Each episode was clear and audio was great.
5,The Lone Ranger rides again-Lone Ranger collection,I bought this as a gift for a friend and he absolutely loved it. He said it was one of the best gifts he has ever received. It played perfectly on his DVD player. His comment to me was that any Lone Ranger fan should have this set!
2,Justified?,"I find myself wondering if these guys are trying to justify their purchases. I have been out to sea for two weeks, am starved for sound and these speakers still sound pretty poor. Granted i have limited experience with 'travel' speakers but i am duly unimpressed.Sony has another set with much larger speakers. I think i'll go listen to them when i get back to land."
5,a smart purchase indeed,"i recived the speakers and now i use them every chance which i get. the bass is produced through a long tube, so it sounds quite a bit deeper than you would think possible. it has better than decent high and mid quality, plus the tubish bass. plus they are quite compact, though you will need some extra pocket space to carry the adapter separately from the speakers, it doesn't fit with the small thin case provided. thats not a problem for me though, since i have a small briefcase thingy to hold my music stuff. also, the batteries seem to last quite a awhile, i've had it for over two weeks so far and they are still not dead. get these if you want excellent portability, and still want quite good sound."
5,A decade of use!,"Even though these are small, plastic and not the world's most impressive speakers, I got a decade of use out of them. They were powerful enough to serve as my main speakers for my home computer from 2002-2012 and any time an eletronic device lasts that long, it's clearly one which was made incredibly well. Recently I broke one of the two speakers off so I have to replace them, but if I had the option to buy another set of this exact model, I would!"
3,"Everything about slavery is cruel, so the drama is implicit",Eventhough it is a short novel the author could have done a much better work sticking to the essence of the drama and the court proceedings about the conduct of the captain of the vessel. But he choose to dwell a little bit to much on some philosophical wonderings of Mhirta which loosen the tension and did not add much to the development of the work.
5,Iomega Zip 100 USB is great,"After struggling for several months to get a CD-RW drive to work properly, I ordered the Iomega Zip 100 USB drive and it works great. Within 20 minutes of opening the box, I had the Zip drive copying files. The drive works very intuitively and is a breeze to use as compared to the CD-RW drive. The disks only hold 100 MB, but this is more than enough for the needs of my office. I also bought a 6-pack of the Zip disks, which should satisfy my needs for a long time. Try the Iomega Zip drive, you'll like it."
4,great travel bag,this fits nicely on my stroller for those days when i am either just going for a walk or to the park and for quick errands! it isnt for a long day trip but it sure makes those quick day trips alot smoother!! glad i purchased it and you will too!!
2,cheap cart,"very cheap product,you can go to home depot and get the same product for 30.00 dollars cheaper"
3,It works,A little hard to assemble but once built it works. Good for use as a home owner. Sturdy and easy to tow.Agri-Fab 500-Pound Dump Cart #45-0303
3,Boys liked it,"Some of the stories are of children being mean to one another, I didn't like that, but my young grandsons liked them."
1,No Warranty Service,DO NOT BUY THIS DRIVE!!!or any Pioneer ProductI purchased the DVR-A03 drive this past Summer. The drive brokein October. Pioneer offers no repair facilities to send the drive back to. They say you have to take it back to the Dealer that the drive was purchased from. Most dealers wont take the drive back if it is over 30 days old.It took me almost a month to get Pioneer and the dealer to agree to let me return it to the dealer (Pioneer still refuses to take it back for repair). I sent it to the dealer who sent it to another distributor who sent it finally to Pioneer. Each step takes over a month.It is now the end of January and the drive is still not fixed and I still have no idea when I will get it back. I have sent letters to Pioneer including the President and have never even gotten back an acknowledgement
4,"Good wild ride, cool movie.","This was a cool movie, not your everyday movie. Granted, this movie is not for everyone but if you're a fan of Oliver Stone's ... don't miss it."
1,More depressing than a British train,"Some films, they're depressing and miserable, but you can see that they're good and enjoy them on this level. This one, however, is just so full of despair and misery that the rest of it is irrelevant. I came away from it wondering why I just wasted a couple of hours of my life on it. Even Jennifer Lopez in skimpy costumes does nothing to lift the flagging spirits. Never watch this film if you're miserable to start with; it could just push you over the edge."
1,Oliver Sone is a druged up hippie!!!!!,"The guy from Australlia who reveiwed this was right!!!!!! I think however that the first 1/2 hour was good but it just got long and boring. I like sickning movies where everybody asked me ""How could you watch that trash?!?!"" But this movie is how they ask me ""TRASH!!!!!"""
3,"Jennifer Lopez in ""U Turn""","Sean Penn as ""Bobby Cooper"" is on his way to pay off a debt in Las Vegas, a gambler finds himself stranded in Superior, AZ with a busted radiator hose. Suddenly the seemingly normal meets the bizarre and treacherous when a beautiful local (Jennifer Lopez as Grace McKenna) and her husband (Nick Nolte as Jake McKenna) suck the gambler into a deadly game of lust, madness and money with only one way out."
2,Technicolor film noir!,"As with the main character played unsympathetically by Sean Penn, I was alienated throughout the entire film, finding only Jennifer Lopez' character to be open and welcoming...There was no mention of the JFK conspiracy unless one looked deeply."
5,"Very, very entertaining!","This Movie is not to be overlooked. Penn, Lopez and Nolte deliver a fantastic performance in this road movie thriller. It's like a fever nightmare. The aesthetics in this movie is very weird, and that's why I a lot of people don't like it I think! But it's really a very good movie. Thank you Stone."
3,Finally a decent Lopez film,"The movie was enjoyable even though Jlo was in it. I don't think I ever watched a Jlo film to the end until this one. She is still a losey actress. The movie was funny. Especially the Sean Penn line "" Is everybody in this town on drugs"" It looked like he actully enjoyed this movie. It had a great cast. Enclulding Nick Nolte and Powers Boothe."
5,bargain,"i dont know how i found this so cheap, but glad i did. Good movie, Jennifer Lopez is in it, and Sean Penn. Just another interesting Oliver Stone film"
5,Movie Review,The CD was everything I wanted & expected. I'll be looking for more titles of movies on Amazon soon!
4,alarm watch review,MeDose works just as advertised. The only complaint I have is the watch is a bit complicated to set up. Had to call customer service for help. Once set up it works great.
2,The Tent,"I read the book The Tent. The story about finding a tent, getting money, and having church services was kind of boring. It isn't my favorite book in the world.On a scale from 1 to 5 I would probably give it a 2. I don't like it because all it does is repeat over and over again. There's never anything real exciting. It's all just the same stuff, just making church services."
3,Not bad,"My parents got me this book when I was a kid. For the time, it was a good book, but does have some errors. Additionally, it has some relative values but they are strictly based a on a ROI (return on investment) standpoint. E.g. it evaluates property development based on the increase in rents, however this ignores some other issues such as the opportunity cost that the additional rent will impose on the other players. All in all it was good for the time, and the main other book out there is ok, but there has yet to be a very good book (in my opinion) on Monopoly strategy."
1,Absolute FAIL for this flick,"Black AngelsThree beautiful women trying to administer vigilante justice to deadbeat dads...sounds like it might be interesting, DVD cover not bad, and it was second-hand to boot...why not?HERE'S WHY NOT - this is one of the worst ""films"" I've ever seen. The script is godawful, the acting is virtually non-existent and cinematography is just a word where this thing is concerned.Avoid this DVD at all costs. This another you can use for either a gag gift (if you like to make folks gag) or to make yourself smile by making someone you don't like a little more miserable."
5,Steamin is Smoken,"This is an album that simply just ""rocks"" it is straight forward 3 man straight ahead rock. There is really not a weak song on board. Here to Rock and Roll and Rock of Gibralter carry the sound of the album with great riffs from Rich Dodson to the pounding bass lines from Ronnie King. The drumming is hard and to the point especially on New Orleans. If you want to hear late 70`s straight ahead rock n roll this is the one."
2,Works for a while,Breaks with regular use after 2 months... If at home and not using headphones during regular commute then it may work for you. As for me I need something more rugged apparently.
1,never received,"Item was mistkenly sent back to Amazon. When I called, I was told there was ""nothing they could do."" They did not even ask me if I wanted to order it again."
1,Unwearable,"I cannot wear these earrings as the post are incredibly short! I have average size earlobes and they do not reach the back of my earlobe, thus making them unwearable. Too bad, because they are very pretty..."
3,A better book is...,"In addition to my previous review, let me add that a much better reference for shell programming is ""Portable Shell Programming"" by Bruce Blinn."
2,Disappointing Purchase,"Clearly NOT the quality I've come to expect from O'Reilly. The sample scripts are not fully explained and the layout is confusing. This book just sits on my desk collecting dust while Rosenberg's KornShell Tutorial is tabbed, highlighted and dog-earred."
4,Good poppy electronic music from Houston,"Produced by Ed Bueller of Pulp/Suede/Ben Lee (not to mention Psychedelic Furs) fame, this Houston trio makes great electronic music that should appeal to everyone. Like the eighties? This is for you. Fan of nineties alt-electronica, then you've found a winner here."
4,Okay but heavy and bulky,"I was attracted to the non stick idea of a marble rolling pin. The ability to stick it in the fridge and have cold marble seemed like it would work really well, and it did to a point. My main problem was with the heaviness and bulky feeling of this rolling pin. Some would probably find the heaviness a plus, for me it just makes rolling a chore, especially when rolling out something like puff pastry that takes a lot of work. The rolling pin just seemed to get heavier and heavier and my wrists more and more sore. Not for me."
1,Larry Norman was not who he said he was,I was very sad to read the news that Larry Norman fathered a child out of wedlock and never took care of him. That makes me feel that the music is not really coming out of a true heart. How can you do something like that and sing about Jesus?I will never buy anything else from Larry Norman again.
5,"""Build a Better Rome""","The first city-building game I ever tried, and I was hooked for life! Huge replayability, easy to learn, keeps you on your toes!"
1,Becomes Old Very Fast!,"The first five minutes of the dvd was interesting; however, after that I found that I was forcing myself to watch it without a great deal of enjoyment."
5,Wow!,"Absolutely amazing! If you're not familiar with Stomp, it is choreographed routines using ""found"" percussion instruments such as broomsticks, kitchen utensils and basketballs. There is no music, just the rhythms and natural sounds of the ""instruments"" used. i inspired my class of Year 8s, who thought it was ""wicked"" and ""cool"". If you're not a music lover it may not be for you, but I have viewed it at least 10 times and found something I had missed with each subsequent viewing. Thoroughly recommended."
5,The Best of Stomp,I saw STOMP live in chicago and have seen the HBO special. I had the sudden urge to watch it again and I was not disappointed. I remember the first time it was aired and this DVD captures every minute of the show. If you have ever seen STOMP...you will love this DVD!!!
4,A Promising New Series,I'm looking forward to more David and Penny Cole adventures. These are cozy-thrillers (if there is such a thing); the style is pleasant and the characters likeable.
2,Not for Contractors taking thier test,"This book is NOT useful for anyone taking there Class ""A"" Contractor Test with PSI. It is more useful for commercial applications."
3,Good listen with a disappointing end,"I listened to this unabriged reading during a long drive. I was engrossed with the story, the reader's voice, and the details, until the 11th hour (literally). I found the ending unsatisfying. The author takes us on a painstaking journey through a woman's life & memory, but she did not allow us to journey with Jane to the end. A twist at the end of a story is satisfying, but the way this twist was presented seems like a cheap trick."
2,Not their best work,"I've read nearly everything that Nicci French has published and I have to say The Memory Game was so disappointing I couldn't finish it. I rarely put aside something I've started no matter how bogged down it gets. I think I only had 30 pages to go and I just didn't care how it ended. I found the main character so annoying and frankly, stupid, with her chain smoking and rambling on at her therapist's office. The Martello family was insufferable. I just didn't get it.I will say this, if you did not like Memory Game DO give Nicci French another try with one of their other books. They are great. I don't know what happened with this one."
1,The Look is Okie but It's not comfortable,"I bought this product few weeks ago, the style is okie but It's hurt my end toes...I'm thinking to return it...but I don't know they're going to accept or not b/c I'm already wear it. If you's looking for this shoe...the style it look okie but not really comfortable to wear."
1,Should have known from the title,"If you like Olivia Goldsmith, don't even think about opening this book or your opinion of her talent will be radically altered. The premise is unbelievably bad, the characters and their dialogue are totally unrealistic and the writer surely cannot be Olivia Goldsmith. I wince to think that I read even 50 pages of this tripe before closing the book with a resounding thud."
2,mostly fluff,"a quick read which is pretty unrealistic, even with me trying to massage my ""willing suspension of disbelief."" only mildly entertaining, poorly developed characters, trite ending."
5,"funny, moving, and oh-so real!","Just finished this book and would like to let women know just how great this book is. It is one of those books that will pull you right in. Funny, moving, and true to life - this book has alot to offer to women who are married or single - showing us ""the grass ain't necessarily greener on the other side"". We just have to be happy wherever we are, and work with what we've got."
1,Don't bother to read this book!!,"First, let me say that I loved her books Young Wives and First Wives Club, but this is simply unrealitic and to suspend belief this much gives me a headache. Just say NO! and go read something else that's what I am going to do. I stopped reading halfway thru when it did not get better but took a turn for the worse. The only person I can see really liking this book is some poor misguided soul that is a ""chick on the side"" hoping for a storybook ending."
2,O.K. but might as well wait for the movie,"I enjoyed ""First Wives"" and ""Bestseller"" as good beach reads but I found this one only mildly amusing. I feel like she wrote it as a treatment for the (sure to come) film script."
4,Interesting,"A great look at its subject matter, but the author is arrogant to the point of it being a significant detriment to the book."
3,IT'S OKAY!,"It was a slow moving story. The overall premise is very good, but to me something of the story was lacking. I would have like to know how society got to that point where everyone lived in gated communities and community services such as the police department have to be paid for out of pocket etc. However, I found the character's concept of Earthseed fascinating."
5,Excellent book,"I love all of Octavia Butler's books. If you've never read any of her, I recommend this one or Lilith's Brood to start."
2,"Mediocre writing, horrible ending.","Although I've heard good things about Octavia E. Butler, this book was the first of hers I read, and it wasn't worth it. The idea is OK, but not enough to carry the book without better writing. The writing conveys action, and some thought, but not much more. The plot starts off well, becomes slightly implausable (but still able to be carried of), and then abruptly ends. I found out a couple years later that a sequel came out, and thus explains the abrupt ending that basically dumps any buildup from the plot out the window, in order to set up a sequel. Without the plot dump, it would be a decent book. With it, it's not even worth reading."
2,Who knew the apocalypse could be so boring?,"The narrative has no sense of pace. It just plods on from event to event, told in mechanical prose. We went here and this happened. Then we went there and that happened. No building of dramatic tension, little development of theme or character progression. A flat recording of events.Odd that the novel posits a new religion but draws its title and its ending quote not from the new scriptures written by the protagonist but from the Bible, which the protagonist says she doesn't believe. The chapter headings are drawn from the protagonist's new scriptures, so why isn't the novel's end-note?"
5,An All Terrain Pole,"I bought this for my wife so that she could more easily navigate the trails of Yosemite and Sequoia/Kings Canyon. She loved it, and now uses two for greater balance on the stony slopes and to cross some of the creeks. Since she's getting faster than I, I suppose it's time for me to switch from my old six foot stick to the Leki."
2,Think Again Biegel,"""...accept the inevitable and advocate for sensible legislation""?That's just what we need at this point, to throw in the towel and step aside as the State finds yet another way to trample the rights of the individual. Biegel has it totally backwards, now is the time to take a stand and ensure that the Interent becomes the beginning of the end of the tyranny of State intrusion into the mechanisms of the market and individual liberty."
3,Revitol review,i used this product for two months and did not notice any changes in my skin. i found something that works much better for about 1/2 the price.
4,Real Food from Real People,"I did not originally acquire this book for the food--I did it because it was a good cause and I grew up in the vicinity of the authors--but in the end, it's about the food. While there are pictures of the celebrity authors and contributors, they are infrequent, black and white candids. Newman and Hotchner let the food take the stage and it is the stuff of fun evenings with friends. While some recipes call for Newman's Own products, it is always stated that cooks may substitute another choices. There is some originality to the dishes--consider making a custard with lemonade instead of milk or baking a cake made with pasta sauce. The directions are simple, the food pleasantly earthy. The selection is a bit idiosyncratic but carnivores and vegetarians will find suitable selections. Not bad at all."
1,A sad day for (my) music.,"I was extremely excited to get an ""authentic"" vinyl sound onto my computer via this tunrtable.Unfortunately, the platter was warped enough to rub annoyingly (making a nice plastic-on-plastic scraping sound) and cause a nasty fluctuation in the sound of the record.So, after reporting the problem to ION, I decided to just take matters into my own hands and return it to Sharper Image. They kindly and quickly replaced it with a brand new one.Excited once again, I put it all together. But only to find that the platter was warped worse than the first one.People have been making (and listening to) turntables for close to a hundred years. Why can't ION make one that works properly now?The idea of the thing is WAY cooler than the actual product. Disappointment overwhelms me."
1,ION TTUSB Audio Turntable,"I bought this product thinking I could convert all of my LP's to a digital format to upload into my Ipod. This product did not work.I was so unsatisfied with this I sent it back. I hooked it all up and started to record. The thing only recorded a few tracks and then for some reason - quit!. I recorded a K-Tel compliation album and some songs were not recorded and the order was wrong for some reason and it wanted more songs than I had entered. I had no idea what the problem was. I tried it on four different albums and then gave up. Like my brother says,, if it does not work out of the box,, send it back!!! And he is on a state technology commission!!If you get this product,, try it right away so you can return it if you find it too much of a hassle. I just even feared trying to see what a recorded tape would do."
1,Do not waste your money on this timer,"Great idea and I was so thrilled to see that this product was MADE IN THE USA, but then so disappointed in its quality. It was no better than MADE IN CHINA junk. The knob was cracked and timer has been returned to seller. We are getting another one, but I am afraid it will not be any better."
4,Musicmania,"There is a reason why music is the universal language. It doesnt matter if it's in English or Japanese, it's the best,and this CD is no exception. It has everything from classical to hard rock. It totally has a feel all of it's own. So if you liked the TV series you gotta get this."
4,Peter Cook - Bedazzled - Lost masterpiece,"As an English person, and fan of American cinema, it always seemed incredulous that Dudley Moore was lionized as a comic genius whilst the acerebic Cook was ignored. Hopefully someone will soon release Bedazzled and the rest of the world will be able to marvel in Cook's comedic brilliance; not only displayed in his acting but also his fine script.Read the other reviews for a plot outline. Read this if you are interested in Britain's finest satirical comic.Cook's performance ranges from slapstickish nun impressions to theological ridicule which Kevin Smith could only dream of aspiring to. Whilst the films episodic structure displays Cook's upbringing in British TV, his script and Donen's direction place Bedazzled at the fore of British comedy films."
1,Classic Movie,"Classic, classic movie. Good English movie, not-great production values but just funny and touching all the way through."
4,"If you use MACD, this is probably essential",This dense 25-page report explains MACD in more depth than anything else I've seen. Includes useful MACD techniques not often found in broader-scope TA books.
2,abridged,"this version is the original 1914 edition. as that was during the great war in europe the book was heavily censored by the editor and publisher (no bolsies allowed!). the original manuscript was retrieved in 1955. more faithful editions since then are well worth reading, in fact brilliant. of historic literary interest only."
1,"If this is an example of the information, save your money","I looked up a friend's listing, and found it riddled with errors, including a contact address that hasn't been current since 1986. For the money, you would think they'd keep it more current."
5,Love these jars!,These sundry jars are exactly what I was looking for. I love the old-fashioned look to them. I just placed another order for a third set.
3,Not too bad,"A little light on substance and a little self indulgent, but otherwise a reasonably good book."
3,Don't Change Your Husband,"Gloria Swanson gets ready for her 1st close-up w/ DeMille in this 1919 comedy. Slight story but crisply told: Gloria divorces her hubby for a cad but realizes the error of her ways. 20-yr-old Swanson is so self-possessed that hubby's 49 years is barely noticeable; they seem like a genuine couple & not a case of cradle robbery. Light, almost dismissive treatment of divorce must have been a scandal @ the time. G's costumes are fabu & the heavily ornate set decoration showcases pre-Jazz age chic. The cad's wooing of G is portrayed w/ a triptych of fantasy scenes: pleasure, wealth, and love, that is a harbinger of Cecil's epics to come. Hubby Elliott Dexter does a fine job as the sloppy hubby who turn himself around to win his wife back. Cute. 6/10"
3,"it cost a lot less, but the brace is kinda big","my wife has a normal size wrist, and even with the smallest setting, this watch is still very loose on her, this is the only flaw, otherwise it is a shiny attractive watch"
4,nice watch,"I love this watch, although need to get to a jeweller to have some links taken out (too big). I get many compliments for it and am happy with the purchase."
4,Love it,"Exactly what I was looking for, genuine as far as I can tell, and my wife loves it! Great value for a great product."
4,good Laurie King story,"I purchased this book only to read ""The Salt Pond"" by Laurie R. King... while waiting for her next Mary Russell novel. It was a great little read... not my favorite... but, as usual, very well written and interesting."
2,not fully compatible,"Sure, it was supposed to be for my exact year/make/model and engine. and sure, it fits. But as I found out from the Hyundai dealer, it does not work properly. Apparently the Hyundai E.C.M. is quite finicky about the input it receives, and this aftermarket O2 Sensor just can't cut it. Wasted my time and my money and still needed to shell out the big-bucks for a genuine OE part."
1,Keeps breaking and repairs take over 2 months,"Mines died after a few months and had to be sent back to repairs. The repair it within two weeks and it worked for a month or so before dying again with the same problem. I send it back again, and I haven't gotten mines back yet even after 2 months. I call and they said they're waiting for parts. Said the only thing they can do is to send back the broken laptop.Note that I have to pay shipping to them, so I lost money on each failure and they won't extend my warranty, so it could run out while I wait for them to repair it."
4,Good Christian book for non-Christians,"I'm an agnostic, but I read this book and its sequel with an open mind, even knowing they were Christian novels.The characters are believable and ring true. The story is engaging and the book is a page-turner.This is a great book for fantasy fans. The Biblical material is applied in a fresh manner, even though I am sure many aspects will anger some Christians that have narrow-minded views that don't coincide with the author's.I truly appreciate the fact that these books are written from a Christian perspective without being preachy and lily-white.The books make you think about the Bible and its implications without being overwhelmed.I think similar attitudes such as the author's would be well used in modern films as well."
5,World in Shadow,"I read the Eternal Warriors series starting with The War in Heaven. That hooked me. I had purchased all three fromAmazon for my Kindle. All three were excellent in my opinion and showed some very intelligent creativity on the part of Mr.Beale. Somehow, I hope the series could get a fourth book. An excellent use of reading time!"
5,Beautiful Trash Can,"I was looking for a kitchen trash can that would fit the space well and compliment our other stainless steel appliances. This trash can does both. It sits nicely against our island without getting in the way and is still large enough to hold a tall kitchen trash bag full of trash. The insert works well and makes it easy to change bags. I like that this trash can has a stainless steel lid as well, not a plastic one. The lid closes softly on it's own. This closing mechanism has, for two months now, withstood being forced shut by my boy who is under 2 years of age without breaking. In short this trash can looks and works great. I highly recommend."
3,Not so great...,"We missed Uematsu in this one. And even though the music fits fine for the movie, it lacks of ""spark"". You can actually enjoy the last two songs and some fo the instrumental, but everything else is good to listen at while doing something else. This is not the kind of music that makes you smile."
1,cant view dvd,i boult this dvd on behalf of my mum she had hear of her friend that it was a good movie. i knew it was coming from a different contry but did not relise it would not work on my dvd playercan anyone help me with this problem? plz
2,"Good book, steep price","Hmm. It seems the other reviewers have beat me to it. And for once, the Amazon reviewers are right. I was going to say the same thing about this textbook: It's a pretty good book on informal logic, but it's much too expensive for what you get. Copi's Introduction to Logic has everything this one does PLUS great coverage of symbolic logic. If you want a book that covers only informal logic, there are others as good as this, at half the price (Feldman, Kelley, Kahane, etc.)."
2,"Okay, but way overpriced","Good intro to informal logic but the price is ridiculous. Buy it used if you can. If it weren't for the $85 price tag, I'd give it four stars, because it's one of the better books on this subject. (However, if you read the co-author's weblog, you might wonder whether knowing logic does you any good in the end.)"
1,Embarrassing packing of a wonderful book.,"The book itself is good; just not the way the item was packed.In all the years I've ordered from Amazon, including products from outside suppliers, this is the first time where the book's many sides (including the front glossy over hardbound cover -- 7 or 8 long, deep but fresh crisp parallel creases across whole wideth and Grant's face; top edge of the back glossy cover has 1/4 inch wide folded back across the whole width.) They were obviously new damages caused from being caught in too tight-fitting a padded envelop when the book was carelessly put in. Unfortunately, it was a birthday gift; there wasn't time enough to order another in time."
3,Fry pan spec correction,"The specs for this fry pan are not correct. I was searching for a 12"" non-stick deep fry pan for my new induction stove top, and was thrilled to find this one by Sunpentown. Then when I received it, I was very concerned by the size of the box, and when I opened it I couldn't believe that it hardly measured 9 1/2"". I wrote to request a return mail label, and questioned if I had been mistakenly mailed a smaller pan, but no response other than the site for return mailing labels. If you are looking for a smaller pan this is a great pan, and would not disappoint. A heavy feel, nice fitting lid, firm handle, non-stick interior, and induction friendly."
3,Original Music missing,"The effort Columbia's made for this album is encouraging, still for all it's fanfare, it's missing the orginal game's music. If you're looking for the music from the original game, you need to go track down an album called, ""Katamari Damashii Soundtrack: Katamari Fortissimo Damashii"". That's the cd with all the original music. It's published by Columbia (Catalog # COCX-32760). You'll know you have the right one, by the cover which resembles the original game's cover. (Cows in pasture, rainbow). I got a hold of a copy from a Hong Kong exporter."
4,NANANANANANANANANA KATAMRI DAMASHI,"It's Katamari music. I Love Katamari music to be specific this is we love katamari music which has some good music but it is not as good as the first game. Oh and that guy who says this is not the music from the game well he is just stupid. The title is MINNA DAISUKI KATAMARI and after talking with my japanese teacher and my japanese friend. I figured out the translation.(Word) (Rough translation) (More literal)(Minna) (we) (everyone)(daisuki) (love) (greatly likeable)(katamari) (This one I will not translate because it is the same)So a more literal translation is ""As for everyone katamari is greatly likeable"" or ""we love katamari"" and a little extra. The ""U"" in daisuki is not pronounced"
3,Getting Started with TCL,I was looking for a book to learn and start programming in TCL. The book has allowed me to do it. I had some problems with the way the informationw was presented. The book does not focus on TCL and the exact explinations for each commandis not present clearly.The book does cover a lot of detail and there is a nice collection of stuff on the CD included so it is a good value for its cost.
1,Avoid,"This book is written for idiots by idiots. The pampering tone and the simplistic examples, that are neither valid nor enlightening, makes me wanna puke....SOA solves everything, if we just disregard complexity and security. Oh, and yes, EAI is bad for you (and wildly different from a SOAP/WSDL ....). Sigh. Even I can produce better trash than this. As a technocrat, it gives me nothing. As a manager, it is full of techno-babble, with examples that doesn't fit business reality and so simplistic solutions, that if a CIO proposed them, he would get thrown out.And painfully boring written as well. Nearest trashbin is too kind a fate for this piece of trash."
2,"High level, very repetitive and too verbose.","I am a J2EE developer working in a telco company.I was looking for a good introductory book to SOA.Browsing amazon web pages i found ""Enterprise SOA"" book. Comments are good it is published from manning and it has only 280 pages.I wish i would not bought it.Contents are too high level, it is very repetitive and too verbose.Authors use verbose scenarios even to describe very easy concepts forcing you to read about 25 lines for something that someone else would have explained with 5 lines.Very detailed diagrams promise interesting contents but they are only there to support banal concepts.The book says it's targeted ""for both business people and technologists""I'm afraid it's only for business people who don't want to be bothered with IT medium-level details.I suggest developers to skip this book and go for something else."
2,Sleepwriting,"Kinley MacGregor's historical fiction is unsophisticated, but this entry borders on simplistic, particularly compared to some of the better authors in the genre. Little care is given to avoiding anachronisms, authentic culture of the time or language. Cliches abound. No matter the age of the characters, they often behave like teenagers. And most dreadful of all, the author now has the characters of the current book thinking or talking about characters who were in the *other* books of this series so frequently that they begin to dominate and overwhelm the events and people of *this* one. You begin to wonder if you shouldn't, perhaps, be reading some of those other books instead of this one, because they sound more interesting than this unsophisticated, repetitive tale. If you like your historical romances rich and a bit more complex, authentic and mature, avoid this one...and I'm guessing, the rest of the series."
5,Lots of Rich Historical Detail.,"This is a very well done historical fiction novel about the wife of Pontius Pilate. Famous for her dream in the New Testament after which she tries to convince her husband not to execute Jesus. The novel opens with her childhood, as the granddaughter of Emperor Augusts who grows up in exile. Who is then sent to Rome upon the death of her Mother. We are treated to lots of rich historical detail concerning the Roman empire and its customs. And to a well written novel wherein in the author cleverly ties together several New Testament stories. I read it first and then my Mother is reading it and also enjoying it. It is more masculinely written than a lot of historical fiction novels out there about women, however, it is delightful nonetheless."
4,Should focus more on puzzles,"I thought it was a pretty well written book. I won $5000 on wheel using this book and I thought it helped me do that. But the book starts off with the history of the show, ways to play at home.. I thought it could have delved a little more into puzzles. The puzzles section it does have is good, but there is no way to guess a letter at a time.. the answers are all there so you either guess the whole thing or nothing.. would have been nice to practice letter by letter like the show. For people going on the show, I suggest the board gameWheel of Fortune Board Gameand the book to cover all your bases."
1,"Incomplete, does not function well","Implies that everything required is included. It is not, be sure to buy the 1/2 inch tubing as well. The 50% of the nozzles do not work properly either, would definitely pass on this product again in the future."
4,Space saver and great look,"This bottle rack is a win/win item. It not only holds a day's worth of bottles for my four month old twins, it does so in less space - just what I need for an already crowded counter top. We received the red version and the color is vibrant and fun! The bottle brush storage is a bonus - no more searching around for where it may have gotten off to or finding it in the bottom of a dirty sink."
3,Looks good but not super functional,"Love the look, also love the brush. Don't love that the bottom tiers are hard to get things onto and then when you do get them on they fall off. Doesn't hold as many things as I would like"
2,not for me,"i found this item by searching amazon for ""made in usa"", however when i received it, i looked on the box and it is clearly labeled made in china. not for me."
2,Plastic cracks easily,"Water does pool, as other reviewers note, but my bigger problem is how quickly the plastic degrades. I've used this for about a year, and every few times when I clean it another piece of the center structure (where the sections screw together) cracks and breaks off. I don't think I'm particularly hard on this, and like very much the way it looks. But now the bottom plate has cracked in the middle. I sure hoped I'd be able to get through sippy cups and into commuter mugs, but I guess not!"
5,"Great Product, handles glass bottles","After buying and returning other bottle racks that could not hold up my glass bottles, I have finally found a keeper. I really like this translucent design because it is very clean and subtle in my kitchen. The stainless steel handle goes well with my stainless steel appliances. It holds 8-9 Dr. Brown glass bottles and all the little parts and nipples without a problem."
2,Water pools and mildews,"I like the stylish design of this drying rack, however, a key issue is that it doesn't drain the water that pools. You end up tilting it daily, to pour out the water, but you still have to scrub it often (or else it smells). Also, nipples don't have much space on this rack. After three months, I finally retired this rack and purchased The First Years rack to replace it. While The First Years rack isn't as modern / clean looking, I like that it drains the water and has space for nipples."
2,A Major Dissapointment,"Tangerine Dream's early years were deeply innovative and incredibly atmosperic, and as a group they practically invented the Ambient movement before anyone had ever heard of the word. This could have been a great opportunity to showcase this dark and beautiful period, but instead it contains most of the WORST bits of thier early cannon. In addition, one of the strengths of thier early works was thier ability to make 20-25 minute pieces develope and flow over time, and most of the pieces on this album are brief 5 minute excerpts. And the last three pieces are all from ""Green Desert,"" which good as it was, didn't need to take up almost half the album. Finally, why call it ""The Pink Years?"" These years were DARK. Deeply atmospheric, moody, and ambient. If you want truly the best of Tangerine Dreams early years, the two CD set ""Zeit"" is the answer."
5,Excellent conflict resolution strategies,"A Lasting Promise teaches practical, effective strategies for resolving conflict. Since the lack of conflict resolution is the #1 cause for marital discord and divorce, it is essential that couples, early on, develop useful methods to effectively combat the all to common slide into marital disharmony. A Lasting Promise provides the necessary tools, and includes exercises to implement these lessons into everyday life. As a pastor, I have found this book a God-send in my pre-marital counseling."
1,ECK!,This doll is seriously ugly. The Diva's stars aren't even really dolls they are robots that say things like lets go boy hunting and i LOVE!LOVE!LOVE! to shop. They suck!!!!!!!!dont waste your money!!!!!!!!
1,BUY A BRATZ!,The diva starz have gone to da dogs. The doll is but ugly and so are the rest of em! I hate it! I hate the hair cuz i canplay with it without sing the doll's bald parts. UUUUUUUUUUHHHHHHHHHH! DO NOT Buy THIS DOLL! AFTER THE FIRST NIGHT I HAD THE DOLL'S UGLY LOOK MADE ME HAVE NIGHTMARES.BUY A BRATZ. tHEY ARE PRETTIEER AND BETTER TO LOOK AT AND PLAY WITH.
3,No wonder the babes shunned me...,"I came of age (no pun intended) during the Sexed-up Seventies but unfortunately didn't partake of any even lukewarm love action for reasons too numerous and too pathetic to recount without using all of this website's available memory. Boulware's book certainly captures the era's mood, aspects of which I experienced only peripherally at the time. However, the book contains the slipshod proofreading that has marred other recent Feral House publications. Misspellings, typos, factual errors, and layout gaffes interfered with my enjoyment of Boulware's heterohorniness study. I apologize if the above complaint seems picayune, but I've always abhorred mistake-laden communication, whether written or oral, for reasons too numerous, etc."
3,Luke warm,Much of the information in this book is how to make a house affordable by eliminating desireable features. There is some useful information.
4,Looks Good,"Don't expect the best of the best for this price, it's not the nicest fabric, but they do look good. My groomsmen and I wore them for my wedding and you can't tell the diffence in the photos.Sizing is for stocky people, I'm usually an XL, but I wore and L and there was plenty of room around, however, it was only just long enough.The pockets are fake.Overall, very satisfied."
3,The Adventure's Reach Extends its Grasp,"I have poured over the adventure material from cover to cover and I LOVE how it is organized. However, all of the contingency plans and interesting NPC's can't save the overall plot of the adventure. It starts out compelling and strong, and ends up circling the intergalactic refresher bowl. The force using Hutt superboss...it was a shame to go through all of the intrigue and well crafted encounters only to face a spice pushing evil force hutt...Did I mention that there is a force using Hutt gangster? If that doesn't make you curl up in the fetal position then you will LOVE this adventure. Otherwise do what I did. Change the story line a bit here and there. Overall, this is a well crafted adventure and worth the sticker price."
1,On the Fringe Interviews,"The majority of interviews in this book border on the bizarre. Interviews with and ""tips"" on dating from a professional dominatrix are laughable. The interviews provide no insights in learning how a man can really experience a woman. The chapter titles reveal nothing about the content as interviews from ""The girls next door"" could and are copied into ""Romance and dating"". If S&M, Bestiality and ""brown showers"" are your ideas of a fun date then this could be your book, otherwise it's a waste of your time and money!"
2,Disapointing,"""The meat of the book, the inner six chapters, was a disappointment to me. Unsure what to expect I looked forward to seeing how Dark would integrate faith and pop culture, how the messages could be used to change lives, to see together how God's message shines through, intentional or not, in the products of our culture. Instead I felt that I was reading the personal journal of someone who was recording his thoughts on varying items, with no real point, reason or direction""The above quote written by another reviewer sums it up for me.The best lines from the book were the quotes he used from other people."
3,pretty but lifeless,"Back in the late 90s Hollywood went crazy for Eastern religions. Although the public wasn't interested they churned out one solemn movie on this subject after another. One of these was Kudun. It's very slow paced and if you are one of those people who needs to figure out a movie in the first ten minutes or you become cranky this isn't the film for you. To be honest, it's more like a historical paegent than a movie. It's beautiful to look at but it's so stiff and artificial that I think Martin Scorsese could've used puppets and gotten the same effect.If you want to watch pretty scenary and costumes Kundun will be enough. If you want the true history of Tibet you'll have to go much further than this."
4,"Wonderfully detailed, true to the history of the Dali Lama","The story is true, the facts displayed honestly and the incredibly rich detail shows the dedication and effort which must have gone into this movie. Not the gripping personal drama of 7 Years in Tibet, Kundun takes a panoramic view of the events in Tibet from the finding of the reincarnation of Kundun to his exile in India.A fine movie worthy of the brilliance of picture and high quality sound the DVD format permits."
5,"Scorsese and ""Kundun"": A gift for a troubled humanity.","For those on the Path, here is a rich and magical offering that will satisfy all those inner memories of Tibet, the Teachings and His Holiness. Scorsese continues his own spiritual search which we first saw in ""The Last Temptation of Christ"", expanded here in sensitive and insightful exploration into the heart and life of a spiritual leader and his courageous people. His Holiness himself has called for all conscious humans, (beginning with the Tibetans themselves), to pray for the souls of the Chinese involved in the bloodbath that has taken place over the last 50 years in Tibet. This film's disclosure and examination of the true story makes it even more miraculous that we are blessed with such a leader who is alive on the planet now in present time, available to us all."
4,not the complete box set,after buying this box set i was very disappointed to find 2 of the films were not in it on reading reviews on this site i knew one film the return was missing but then i discovered that the curse of the pink panther was also not included.
2,Where is the missing DVD???,"With one DVD missing from the collection The Return of th Pink Panther.. The one with Christopher Plummer..... How can this be called a complete box set ? I felt duped and taken and wish I had not purchased the so called 'Box Set'. I believed that I had all the series, however, one of the best ones is missing. I wouldn't purchase until this is corrected..."
5,GREAT BOOK,"This is a very fine book. It explains the concepts very clearly and maybe used for signals too, when studying fourier and laplace transforms. The authors do a superb job and make challenging concepts sound easy for the student. Extremely organized and well prepared book."
4,Got to love history,"I really enjoyed this book. Being always fascinated by this historical, I found this book to be informative and educational. If I ever make a trip to New York, I will definitely visit the museum - all because of this book."
4,Concise and very useful,I have found this book to be a great source to get an informative summary of another countries history and politics.
1,Cheap product,Product failed after 3 months. Plastic screw tip broke off and was not repairable. Will need to replace entire telescoping pole. Hook portion is fine. Would not recommend and would not purchase this item again. Purchased a telescoping paint handle/pole with metal screw and that works much better. This boat hook is not worth the money.
2,"ok, not great","I've decided to stop running the Nevegals. They wear out way too fast (5 good rides and the knobs are about gone), plus i have had a couple of them bulge out on me.Time to try Maxxis out, I've heard great reviews about them!"
1,"No pictures, all text","I love Len Losik's articles but this book falls short. I was also disappointed with his question & answer guide but it was comparable with other Q&A books and was pretty good for that type of book.This book is pretty much in manuscript form and I like the ""Forms at a Glance"" but that is only included for Kicho Hyung Il Bu."
2,Good when it works,"Unlike the other review, I can not recommend this at all. The GPS regularly takes at least 10 minutes to find satellites (sometime longer), the Palm needs to be resynced (bluetooth) with the GPS at least once a month. When it does work, its great though."
5,Sugar substitute,"This is an excellent product that I have been using for more than 40 years, but which I can no longer find for sale in my two local supermarkets."
3,Fell asleep,"No comment, Lots of redundant material that is not spiced up or made interesting. Good grammar and lots of yawning. Sorry, J"
5,Gripping! A Life Condensed In a Thoroughly Digestable Digest,"A fictional diary, this Lenin's tale through his own eyes, starting from early boyhood until shortly before his death. Though some 700 pages, it is more exhaustive than exhausting, and so awfully entertaining I daresay for a month I couldn't put it down. While no substitute for Trotsky's history of the Revolution, this is a historical distillation bound to give an insight into both Lenin and his times. Alan Brien has worked an undiscovered masterpiece!"
5,The Best So Far!,"Eternity is one of the most incredible new age albums ever to be released to date. It contains astonishing music which still displays mythos' style, however adds to it a traditional blend of both Brazilian and Celtic sounds. It's amazingly relaxing and inspiring from one song to another. Every song is a surprise! Victorian styles and structures are expanded into fantastically different directions. Quite ""musical"" realms of near-abstraction sport patterns unlike garden-variety song structures. Radical post-processing of aquatic field recordings from all over North America yields decidedly unnatural results. Send sweet sonic gaseous into the space between your ear, as shapeless, lovely and tangible as a cloud.The only fault I found is that it's too short for such heavenly tunes, and it ends with the listener begging for more!If you liked the previous Mythos albums, buy this one without thought."
3,Mediocre,"I bought this book hoping for some admin-like advice, i.e. SSL usage, restrictive relay settings, MX records, etc.Unfortunately it comes up short on advice, but reads mostly like a reprint of the Exchange help files. If you're new to Exchange 2000/2003 this will help you find where they moved all the settings and controls..."
5,Sleepeasy Yields Rewards...and Sunflowers,"""Oh, Harry, my dolls weren't imaginary...""After her earthly life, the world Barbara Briggs has constructed is filled with quirky characters, a lovely lake and the ability to control it all...until her dead husband Harry shows up. His consciousness (and subconsciousness) upsets the precarious balance and, now, life and death in Silver Lake take on new meaning. How can one possibly die if one is already dead; how could one possibly be dead if one feels alive?These are just some of the questions in Sleepeasy.Through deliciously dark humor and intriguing characters, Wright allows us to explore these issues while deftly navigating us through both the corporeal world and one not quite so.If you like the challange of balancing several related plots and trust that Wright will creatively build the bridge between these worlds, you will absolutely love Sleepeasy.And you also may never again look at a field of sunflowers in quite the same way."
5,"Cool Music, Awesome Message",The Apologetix did a great job on Spoofernatural! My husband and I use it as a witnessing tool because it reaches out and grabs people with its familiar grooves and presents many Bible truths. My children absolutely LOVE it!
3,As dumb as they come,"But I mean that in a nice way, mostly. The original cartoons were pretty goofy, and this flick hits just about the same level of amusing one-joke monotony. Except for Angus - he gets all the best scenes.It's kid-safe humor, but without the wit you might hope for. Violence is bloodless and reasonably subdued, and the closest thing to an adult theme is a slight recurrence of ""where did my pants go?"" humor. Slapstick visual gags carry this movie but, for my taste, the funniest moment was probably the over-earnest disclaimer at the end. Either that or the chicken.-- wiredweird"
1,"A FEW LAUGHS,BUT NOT MANY. COMEDY FANS:DO NOT RENT THIS!!!!!","THERE ARE A FEW LAUGHS,BUT MOST OF THEM ARE MISFIRES. DIE HARD LESLIE NIELSON FANS MAY HAVE A HARD TIME LIKING THIS. RECOMMENDED FOR KIDS ONLY."
1,A dreadful attempt at a comedy.,"In the worst perfromance of his career, Leslie Nielsen stars in ""Mr Magoo"", a dreadful attempt at a comedy which fails on every level. Pointless from beginning to end, it's hard to believe that movies as bad as this actually get made."
3,Keeps You Guessing!,"I actually loved this movie. Including the song ""Can't Let You Go'.-By Erika J. Who,Why,What are the questions you keep asking yourself. Keeps you guessing untill the end. Best Friends Are Forever, and what he or she'll do for vegenace. I liked it, some reviews are helpful but you have to see for self first. TTFN"
1,"NO, NO, NO","STUPID, DISAPPOINTING, AND DISGUTING, SAVE YOUR MONEY, THIS MOVIE WAS CHEAP, THEY COULD NOT GIVE IT TO ME FREE OF CHARGE, A WASTE OF TIME, TRUST ME ON THIS ONE. KNOCK, KNOCK HERE IS YOUR MOVIE BACK."
1,FROZE AND LOCKED UP,"0 Stars if amazon offered that choicefortunately amazon took it backthe unit froze during recording with a good commercial dvd blank (memorex) which is advertised on the amazon site.I did everything that the manual stated and then called panansonic, the tech department told me the unit needed to be returned;I can see from postings that other people have had this problem,The unit goes into power cycle every two minutes and then goes off and on and recylces; according to the manual this is supposed to be self correcting; after 2 days it did not correct; the drawer would not open to eject the disk.Something is wrong with their software.agree withn other comments regarding the long delays in firing uphad pioneer recorder for 3 years excellent but was unable to find one on line possible change of models or they decided to get out of the market"
4,Works fine,"I am quite happy with the unit, and I believe it performs as advertised. I use it daily with readily available ($5) DVD-RAM media and enjoy the DVR-like features including commercial skipping and playback while recording. There are also some cute functions like the ability to playback at 1.3X normal speed (works fine with news programming) and the video thumbnails for playback selection.The tuner works well and tolerates a wide range of signal levels, though digital sub-channels take a couple of seconds to lock (vs. 1 second for analog stations). Also, I have had no occurrences of software bugs after I read the manual and stopped pressing buttons faster than it could keep up.I would not recommend this hardware, however, if you only want to make an occasional DVD-R recording (there are less expensive units for that), or if you expect up-converted signals to rival HiDef (there are much more expensive units for true HD capability)."
2,Noisey!!!!!!,"Put a DVD in and hear it spin like a jet engine while you watch it! Its a shame because it has all the features I am looking for, but the unit is kinda crappy quality. The response of the device is really slow too. When you click on the remote buttons to change settings or channels there is a 3 second delay before the unit responds. It took me 5 minutes to set up and within 10 seconds I knew I was going to return it because of the disk noise. Its a shame."
1,Not all its cracked up to be.,"When I called panasonic to find out the unit's capabilities, a Panasonic sales rep said that still pictures could be recorded and played on CD's, DVD's, and DVD RAM's. This unit cannot play DVD's of still pictures. With CD's the unit will not play back recorded still pictures in the order recorded."
2,Does not live up to the price,"We have two children that are a year apart and needed a monitor system that we could place in both of their bedrooms and still hear. On paper this looks like the perfect monitor, until we got it home. Prior to this monitor we had the fisher-price sound and lights and it worked great. This had terrible static on the parent monitor as well as how the lights lit up our entire bedroom when the lights were out. For that price we expected clarity and didn't receive it. Now we are faced with a dilemma because you can't have two baby monitors in the same house and this one didn't live up to our expectations. Many reviews said they were unhappy I should have headed their advice and not even purchased it."
1,GREAT IF YOU LIKE STATIC,We were so excited to see this monitor on the market because we have 2 small children and a split bedroom plan. Our excitement turned into a HUGE disappointment when we plugged it in and all we heard was static. We tried it in several places and nothing worked. It is a great idea; someone just needs to make one that actually works and I will be the first one to buy it. Save yourself some time by not buying this monitor and having to return it.
1,very disappointed,"I read all the reviews and thought this would be a great monitor with our second child arriving soon. That was until we got home used it for three nights and realized how much I hate it. There is a constant hum on both of the parents unit (not like our fisher price monitor), I had to turn the volume up all the way to hear our son and still had a hard time hearing him. (the baby unit was appoximately 4 feet away from his bed) The concept on this monitor is great, if they can work out the kinks"
2,Not so perfect,"I thought this monitor would be awesome. I could put one downstairs and in two different bedrooms. Well one monitor doesn't even work and who has time to contact the company with a new baby. The monitor that does work has a lot of static. It is hard for me to fall to sleep at night with the thing on. So, I can't even use walkie talkie feature. I am not happy with this product. Overall, I would not recomend it."
1,save your money,[...]i have a 2 year old and a 9 week old so i thought this would be perfect. i followed the directions and had them all set to the appropriate channels.i agree with all of the other negative comments...no need to rewrite them. three words of my own to add....STATIC STATIC STATIC.
1,Not worth your time or $$,"I thought the people who gave this a bad review just got a bad item and that I would get a good model that would not have static and feedback, well I was WRONG!!! This was not worth my time or energy tracking it down. Has a clicking to it and has constant weird noise as it switches to different channels. I would not recomenrd this one. It is going back tommorow. Great concept but bad execution."
3,Valid extension of the original.,"""More E-Prime: To Be or Not II"" stands as a worthy appendage to Bourland's original. But note the ""appendage"" label.I read ""E-Prime II"" perhaps a year ago; I read the original, ""E-Prime: To be or Not,"" many years ago. The original had a significant effect on the way I write and speak. It added a valuable problem-solving tool to my communicative tool box.For me, the sequel lacked that importance, but readers who struggled with the original book may benefit from the sequel's extended explanations and additional examples.For a student new to E-Prime and General Semantics, I would not pass up the original in favor of this sequel."
4,Great for older kids,"My 12 year old daughter enjoyed this book and my husband and I had fun interacting with her on our trip; however our 3 1/2 year old was a little left out, many games in here were too advanced for her and require basic reading skills that she has not mastered yet."
2,Disappointed!,"I thought this movie would be pretty good based on the very capable cast of characters, but I found it to be actually very boring. Absolutely nothing happens here, except of course at the end where the sick boy finally (predictably) dies. There is no plot, no action, nothing. There are some weird paranormal parts in the movie, too, which did nothing but serve to confuse me. For instance, there's a cliff scene where the boys supposedly jumped off and started to fly, but I have no idea what that was in there for or what it was supposed to mean. This is the first and last Rob Turner film I'm going to see ever."
2,The Shovel End is Too Small,"For an all purpose utensil, the spatula end is way to small and it's a little curved on the shovel portion. Haven't found a good use for it yet."
4,Calphalon Nylon All Purpose Turner,Calphalon Nylon All Purpose TurnerGOOD TURNER... IT MAY JUST BE ME BUT I FEEL LIKE THE TURNER EDGE STAYS GREASY OR HAS A BUILD UP EVEN AFTER WASHING. BUT THE ITEM GAVE ME EASE AND GREAT CONTROL AND I FELT IT IMPROVED MY COOKING TIME AND PROCESS.
2,Thought it was nice....,"I bought this spatula for frying eggs. Apparently I use the skillet way higher than most. the end of the spatula melted to the skillet. I have anodized steel cookware, so it may just be hotter than most."
1,Very poor quality turner,"This product is not heat resistant at all even though it is advertised to be. Bought 2 of these and the ends of both partially melted and bubbled up with ordinary use such as turning fried food. Partial melting, bubbles up of material, and warping of end of turner occurred within only a few uses. Turner was not exposed to any excessive heat. What poor quality!!! Do not waste your money on this product."
1,smells terrible,Smell was bad. Not even close to the real thing. I should have listened to the other review that stated this.
3,It is good for the most part.,"I rated this a three because when i got it, it was stiff. it has been about a week, and it feels like it is falling apart. You can shake it and hear pieces wanting to fall out."
2,Don't buy this,"The Rubik's Professor is terrible compared to the V-Cube 5. The Rubik's Professor Cubes don't turn well and their stickers peel off after only a few hours of cubing. You have to twist them slowly or pieces will break (a center piece broke in half on mine). I would be more merciful on this cube if it were the only 5x5 available, but it isn't. You can buy V-Cubes here on Amazon or Eastsheen 5x5 cubes on eBay. Both are better than the Rubik's ones.Don't buy this because it's cheaper than the V-Cube. The Greek-made V-Cube 5 is, like, infinitely better than this. It's worth the extra $10."
4,What a good purchase.,"I bought this cube a couple of weeks ago. So long I've solve it two times and the stickers are just fine, even though I keep punching them with my nails. I don't know if the factory is using a new type of glue- but my toy is just perfect. It's the first time I play with a 5x5x5 cube, but it has resisted the fact that I don't know how to move it correctly yet.I'm quite happy with my purchase, and I'm playing a lot with it."
1,Do not buy this cube,"This product is poorly constructed and is definitely not worth it. When I took it out of the box I noticed how unstable it seemed compared to the 3x3 and even 4x4 Rubik's cubes. The layers needed to be 100% aligned in order to turn. Even when the layers are aligned, it still takes a lot of effort to turn. I contacted Winning Moves complaining about this product. They sent me a new Rubik's 5x5 cube, but it was poorly constructed just like the first cube. I was very disappointed with this product and highly recommend that you do not purchase this product. If you want a good 5x5 cube, buy theV-Cube 5 Multicolor. It is more expensive, but is constucted much better."
5,Great Buy,I bought this product and just got it after i ordered it two days ago and it said that it would come the fifth. As soon as I got it I started playing with it and there was nothing wrong with it. And for $9 it was an unbelievable deal. You would usually pay like $30 in a store and not get the thrill that something is coming in the mail.
2,Disappointing,"I've used rubik's cubes since the early 80s. I thought this would be a good purchase but the first one I bought broke the first day I had it. I exchanged it for a new one and with my treating it carefully, it has stayed together.However, the stickers are completely worthless. They didn't last 2 weeks before they started completely peeling off.These things aren't real cheap.I've had the same problem with ""modern"" 3x3x3 cubes. The stickers are worthless.I won't waste my money on another Rubik's product."
2,"Great cube, but don't get this version","My biggest problem when I opened this cube was that it was really stuff. The stickers tend to peel off really fast and chip off. It's not really that great. It can be very fun. Once you learn how to solve a four by four, you'll be able to figure this one out. It's a little challenging and I still have problems with it. Took me about twenty minutes to figure out. Really fun to play with, but very fragile.After about four days of playing with this cube, it's already starting to fall apart. It's not good. I'd just shell out the extra ten bucks and get the 5x5x5 made by v cube. That is an outstanding cube--not this one."
2,DONT buy it if you want to play,"I have to admit that I am disappointed about the quality of this product.Seriously, DONT buy it.Mine broken within a week with gentle twisting......."
1,1.3 MP Digital Camera,"Black VistaQuest 1.3 MP Digital KeyChain CameraThis is quite possibly the worst product I have purchased in years. It is essentially numerous misshapened pieces of plastic that neither fit appropriately or function in any way. It is utterly worthless!I gratefully returned two of these cameras after opening them at Christmas to the disappointment of my two children!Don't bother, move on to another product"
4,"Good elementary material, but thin for exam prep","I used both this kit and New Riders 'Networking with TCP/IP' exclusively for this exam, which I scored well on. One thing about MS training is that they seem to assume you know nothing and start with the basics, but several topics (DNS and subnetting, especially) are not explained thoroughly enough for a rookie to master. This book may be enough to pass the exam, but not ace. The New Rider's book is enough to ace the exam."
3,Decent study material,"This book was at the most decent study material for the exam. It gives you a lot of the surface understanding of the subject but doesn't give you the indepth information to really understand TCP/IPing. I ended up using this book as a 2nd hand resource to Mark Minasi's book ""Mastering TCP/IP"". Minasi's book covered in detail just about every area of this subject.I wouldn't tell anyone not to buy this book, but I would tell you to get a book that goes more indepth and use this book as a 2nd study reference."
2,Did NOT meet my expectations!,"This book is good except for one very important aspect of TCP/IP: subnet masking. The author(s) gave very little explanation on determining a mask for a range of IPs. They mention in one paragraph about using more than one octect to determine a mask, but fail to give any detailed explanation. I used other books to get a thorough understanding. I'm not a novice. I've been working in IT for eight plus years. Try an O'Reilly book instead!"
5,Proof is in the Pudding,"I passed the exam with flying colors (score 966) on the first try with this kit as my only resource. That says it all. Yes, some of the topics could be covered in more depth. Don't just read the book and expect to be an expert. You have to get hands-on experience with the product (which is enclosed with the kit). Use the book as a starting point, then explore menu options and test different configurations. Experiment with the command line utilities. This process worked great for me. Also enclosed with the kit are copies of the TCP/IP RFCs. Explore them too. Lots of valuable information is found within. This training kit does have prerequisites listed on the box. Be aware of them."
4,great,"This book is a good book to read either for a class or for enjoyment. It is not that hard to read, it is humorous. I enjoyed it very much."
2,Do not try to imitate something so great as MacLean!!,"Imagine the thrill you must feel, picking up a new book by your favorite authou now long gone. You open the book, but after the first chapter, you are utterly disappointed. Sam Llewelyn has abused the good name and memory of Alistair Maclean to his own profits by trying to imitate one of the worlds greatest writers in crime and suspence. There are no points in the book, they are never shocking like the finalé in ""Where Eagles Dare"", and there is no suspence, since all they do are run from Germans. And to make the Germans shoot people just to get some sort of effect is also abusing the way MacLean wrote his novels. Stay away from this book, but if you want to read the horror to yourself, pleace, borrow it on the library, so you don't have to spend money on that attrap."
2,frustrating but none cheaper,"It is true there is no better barn for the price, but this barn has brought both myself and my husband to tears trying to get it together. I thought it would be nice to have a barn we could pack up and put away. Big Mistake! Putting it together the first time was OK and sort of a fun puzzle, but every attempt since has been horrible. I recommend getting it together (solidly) the first time and leaving it. (Perhaps instructing the children to play with it gently.) While I haven't thrown it out, I did bury it in a closet and am currently shopping for a new one...I didn't mind the plastic and cardboard so much, but it would be easy to make a similar product that kids could put together themselves, instead of a team of clever and patient adults."
2,For the price its fine.....,"My daughter got this barn for Christmas from grandma. For the price she paid for this toy is fine. Yes its cardboard and plastic but what do you expect for a horse barn priced under twenty bucks with a Breyer brand name on it. My daughter is five and she likes it. Just dont try and move it around and make sure its on a solid surface because the floor is thin cardboard. And yes it was a monster to try and put together, the cardboard would not stay in the plastic grooves, but overall its a fine toy. I wouldnt expect it to last very long, and if water gets spilled on it the the cardboard will warp. But it serves its purpose. Although, just to let you know we have bought a wooden barn just recently to replace the cardboard plastic one."
1,a bit of the unusual,"I love the uniqueness of the didgeridoo and yes this album has that one of a kind sound. But I found it to be a difficult one to enjoy, and the CD turned out to be not at all what I expected.The combination of didgeridoo and flute mixed with some human vocals and ocean sounds gives it a definite atmospheric tone. For a short while, track number four: Dolphin Journey, takes on a transforming feel. But otherwise this CD had me wishing for something else.It's not for everyone and much like the land the didgeridoo originates from, it's a bit of the unusual."
4,shop fox D2837 5 inch deep reach pipe clamp,I use it for medium clamping tasks and proves adequate in spite of its somewhat saggy sliding precision
4,Reality check,"This is a curious and original book. Somewhere between a channeled work (with the somehow typical warped language of an alien entity), and a philosophical treatise, Manifest. spins a compelling web. I found it hard to read-no, not exactly-hard to stay with, but underneath is a current that swept me up and opened up new ways of thinking about the world around me. And about all that surrounds the world around me. I recommend it."
2,Not impressed,"I use this book as the text for my marine biology class. I find the numbering of the book odd. It is done by chapter and page. For example, the 3rd page of the 4th chapter is 4-3. And it is the only book I have ever come across that actually has empty pages. ??????????? I don't get it. The taxonomy is overly simplified. However, as a general Marine Science book, it does the job. More non-biology stuff and not quite appropriate for a class titled Marine Biology."
1,"3 Days of Joy, and that was it","I too have had the problems mention in the other reviews with the 8820. The tech support was zero help and everyone I asked had ideas that didn't fix anything. The software was a joke, after I installed the drivers my printer spooler would cause a system crash, and my sons scanner which was half the cost gave me better images. If you are looking to buy a scanner stay away from Visioineer/UMAX 8820. I now have to go and buy another scanner too."
4,Love it!!,"I have had this model since November 2009 and I use it nearly every day. I tried going by the cooking chart and overcooked a pork roast so I adjusted the cooking time and the next time it was cooked to perfection. I have cooked steak, chicken pieces, whole chicken, pork chops, roast pork, bacon, beef roast, and meatloaf, all of which turned out well. A few days ago I finally cooked from frozen and tried a frozen beef roast that turned out great. Clean up is easy/quick. Shortly after purchasing mine I started seeing the advertisements for the NuWave Oven Pro and wished that I had waited to get that one. I know that soon I will invest in the Pro and pass this one to another."
5,Nuwave is wonderful,"I have been extremely pleased with my Nuwave oven. I does a great job of keeping meats tender, tasty and moist. I have cooked chicken, pork chops and steak and they have all been delicious. It also saves cooking time. I can complete my entire meal in less than half the time. I would recommend it as a ""must"" for the busy on-the-go person. Katie"
3,Disappointing,"I bought this book as a gift for my parents who are dealing with cancer and could use something to brighten their day. It looked promising, but I was let down. I was under the impression that it was a witty book revolving around cancer survival, but instead I found a mishmash of essays and memoirs on nothing in particular, sometimes involving cancer, and rarely impressive. I'm sad to say it came off as amateurish, and I gave my parents a different book (No Place Like Hope).I noticed after I'd bought it that this book was published by a self-publishing company, not a ""real"" one. If I'd seen that before, I might have saved myself some time. As it was, the most charitable thing I can say about it is that while it wasn't as good as I'd hoped, it wasn't as bad as it could have been. And there may be better material in the parts I didn't read. For the author's sake, I hope so."
4,A College Kid's Perspective,"I initially picked up ""God Does Have a Sense of Humor"" as a fun summer read, but quickly became so engrossed in the stories that I couldn't put it down. Mr. Ballister has such a descriptive way with words that I cringed in sympathy even as I laughed at the predicaments in which he found himself. With vignettes ranging from childhood experiences to attempts at love to a military career, there is something in this book for everyone to connect to and to appreciate in Mr. Ballister's optimistic style that reminds us even the serious things in life can have the proverbial silver lining."
4,A Feel Good Read!,"From his insightful views on surviving cancer to hilarious anecdotes like ""Attack of the Avocado Woman,"" Rob Ballister's book GOD DOES HAVE A SENSE OF HUMOR is a joy to read. The author provides us with a collection of short essays, which are at most times funny, sometimes poignant, but always entertaining and original. Rob's unique take on life is reminiscent of the legendary Art Buchwald, with a hint of comedian Jeff Foxworthy.This is a wonderful book, whether you read it cover to cover or savor it in snippets. I look forward to reading more from this talented writer."
2,Ho hum,"There isn't much to this movie other than a great ""look"" to the sets. The various stories aren't the least bit new, and the actors really don't have much to reach for. It's the kind of movie that you should watch only if you are stuck in a hotel room for 90 minutes with nothing to do. Oh, one of the 1-star reviewers said that the ""level of nudity"" should have given it an R rating: that's absurd -- the only nudity is a very brief glimpse of a man's rear, and that was just as a not-very-surprising mistaken identity punchline."
1,fahgetaboutit,"Movie a must; quality of tape a bust - literally, it skipped and got jammed into my DVD player. Scratched up DVD anyone?"
5,Perfect Adaptation of Wonderful Book,"Miss Pettigrew Lives for a Day is a delightful book. The movie brings it to life. The story is quirky, funny and imaginative. The casting is excellent; the characters are cast in exactly the right roles. Highly recommended."
3,Love the movie however the volume is too low,"I bought two copies of this. I'm sure this is not the seller's fault but this was not made well. Both copies have reduced volume. I have to sit super close to the TV and I only know what's being said because I saw this in the theatre. The person I gave the 2nd one to had never seen it before and could not hear it well enough and just gave up.I do love the movie, though!"
4,Too bad they're discontinued...,"A useful wrist pager and an OK watch. Had one for about 2 years - beat the heck out of it. Drowned it several times inadvertantly. I would still own one if the paging service wasn't so over-priced. The first year of Skytel was free - an offer that was the clincher that got me to try it in the first place. Multiple alarms, multiple time zones, and a lousy watch band."
2,where is the rest of the story?,"I agree that Jim Henderson presents a likeable, ordinary, friendly, compassionate, loving, meeting needs, accessible Jesus.All of the things he shares are fine and wonderful attributes that everyone including Christians, should be demonstrating in this world. My question: what happened to Jesus - WHY did He go to the Cross? What happened after that? What is the message of the Cross if being a nice, friendly, accessible, ordinary guy is all there is? Maybe Jim Henderson gets around to all that in his ministry, but he did not let me know anything about that in his book. Where is the rest of the story? I am still waiting."
2,Functional but cheap,"Initially I thought that this was a good pouch, however, after about 2 weeks of normal use it started to fall apart."
2,Got this with my treo and I am sorry I did,"Let me start by telling you that I am a heavy business cell phone user. Having a clear and understandable conversation is very important for me and my customers. I was very excited about bluetooth as being hands free is great when multi-tasking. This headset did allow me to hear conversations marginally well, but the person on the other end was unable to hear me. Regularly, I heard ""are you on a headset, can you get off of it I can barely understand you"". Apparently, I was cutting out an unacceptable amount on their end. Due to this happening on every call I was forced to stop using this headset. Overall, my experience with this product was not a good one."
2,"Loose, bad voice pickup, good sound","This was the first BT headset I ever bought and after only 2 days of use I realized that this headset was not for me. It was extremely loose on my ear and, even though it never fell off, I constantly was having to adjust it to make it tighter. Furthermore, the people who I was talking to kept telling me that they could not understand me. The earpiece is great and it is easy to hear those who you are talking to; however, the looseness and poor voice pickup make this headset a bad buy, even for the price!"
3,"not the greatest, not the worst","I had hoped for more from the Jabra ear piece. The range isn't as much as hoped for, but over all, I do like it. I especially like the fact that I can change the look.The fit around my ear is not as comfortable as hoped, either, but I HAVE worn looser and less comfortable ones. It IS light, and that is a plus. Being able to change it from left ear to right ear is nice as well."
1,On my 3rd one!!!,"I bought my first Jabra about 8 months ago. It just stopped charging - I hadn't done anything to it. I moved and misplaced the receipt, so they wouldn't honor the warranty.So I bought another one 2 months ago.. I really liked the leopard print and the changeable features. Now it has stopped charging as well!!!I'm a business professional with a Motorola Q and I can't stop and hold something the palm of my hand to my face every phone call. I call customer service and ask them if they have had complaints about this and he says, NO. That's bull - I keep finding complaints about this product everywhere!I'm not spending another $50 on this phone, they need to send me one that works all of the time or I'm switching!!!"
3,New to the Barbie thing,The unicorn has a very hard time standing up on its own. I am constantly putting the unicorn up straight and adjusting the reins for my 3 year old. I would only buy this for a true Barbie fanatic who would put up with the design flaws.
2,It's not heavy duty,"It is a nice size bag. I was able to carry a bp cuff, drug book, stethoscope, thermometer, and pulse ox. However, I've had this for about a little over 3-4 months and the flap ripped apart...the flap is made up of flimsy cardboard and started slipping out. It didn't last very long."
5,Friend loved it!!,"Bought this for a friend who loves Adventure TimePackaging was so cute (cut out Finn head cover) and shipping was fast for delivering to England, really tempted to get myself a copy now!She absolutely loved being able to watch AT episodes back to back so I am very happy with my purchase :)"
5,What everyone's been wanting to have released,"This dvd set is great- the packaging is more than you would expect for something from cartoon network and clearly a lot of thought was put into it. I was personally waiting for a season set of this show to come out before I bought anything so I was quite pleased to find this at a very reasonable price. The extras were great fun to watch, although personally I could have done a bit without the awkward cosplay fan reel, but at the same time AT has such bizarrely designed characters that morbid fascination actually made some of the better costumes on the reel not too excessively painful to sit through. The behind-the-scenes bits were also a lot of fun, especially the story boards as well! Overall, I was very, very pleased with this set, and if I had to pick one thing to critique it would be to have more commentaries than there were- they were great fun to listen to. I can't wait for the season two, three, and four sets to come out some day!!"
3,Ok,"Or you could just get the first two discs that have already released and get four other episodes, first one has 12 and 2nd has 16 vice the ""first season's"" 24. I bought both before this was ever put on here. Sure it cost a little more for both discs, but hey I cant see into the future."
5,This show is so funny!,"This show is awesome it is hilarious and funny! I love it I watch it all the time! It's been hard to find a good show for my age ( I am 12. ) But I just love this show! It's funny, cool, epic, and NOT CHEESY ( finally! ) I am going to watch every single on of these episodes!"
1,"It's addictive, not particularly fun","The entire game is based on raising your characters level to meet the next goal, it's a neverending treadmill. Verant realized this of course and added in ""Hell Levels"" where it takes two or three times the work to get through. Aside from the ease of communicating with others, which can be done in any chatroom, the game is pointless. It actually gets harder as you increase in level. It's addictive because they always hold something just ahead of you, and you think ""just another couple levels and I can have that spell!"". Every time you gain abilities npcs gain two. It's infuriating, and time consuming."
1,"Sorry to say, but i think this game is a piece of (...)!","How can i start? I have been playing online games for a long time(with my favorite being Ultima Online), and I must say this is the worst I have played thus. Poor, complicated camera angle system, very hard to see at night, and I had a problem finding people in game who were willing to help me start out. But a must give it some credit for it's good graphics. Sorry for everyone out there who likes this game, but I would give it a .5 if possible.*one thumb down*"
2,Can you say Pac-man?,"You may of seen my last review, that was kinda of an introduction to EQ. Now that I think about it makeing your own quest is a little off from what describes this game. I think Pac-man is what describes this game. Why do I say that? Pac-man was a game where you did the same thing over and over with no sign of changeing, this is what Everquest is. You run around and kill things and sell the loot. As you progress through the game you kill new things in new places with new ways to kil them. In this game thats al you do no story just the same thing over and over with no sign of change. If you ever get caought in this Everquest web you'll eventually notice your doing the same things over and over. The rewards for killing things are very slim, next to nothing. Then you'll eventually be able to kill other players and take their loot. Thats all that Everquest is, no matter how many quests their are for you the rewards are nothing to be noticed."
1,EverQuest: The Game of Downloads,"EverQuest is a good game, but with the terrible download times and the added patches, and everything else, including ALL THE BUGS!!!!!!, it is a terriblegame. You spend 20 hours downloading the dumb thing, and then another 20 loading the thing. I think that sony should think of letting Verant work by itself. Sony doesn't care. The Tech Support for the game is AWFUL!! i can't believe they expect people to pay (price)!! per month! I could see if it was free, but (price)!! What a rip-off"
2,Too Long,This movie could have been about 30 minutes shorter.The movie is beautifully filmed but the lead actor is never happy about anything.The French Canadien prejudice angle comes across pretty weak also.It's also hard to pull for the guy punching the ref and whacking another player with a stick (in reality there was a delayed penalty called on the play that took the Rocket out and it wasn't the 1st time the Rocket hit a player with his stick).Only for the hard core hockey fan.
5,ROCKET,I just got my copy of The Rocket from when I had pre-ordered it. I watched it again and it's still so good. It just came out to DVD. I love how it really shows what hockey was like during the 50s. The fight scenes with Avery are great and the story of Richard is inspirational. I want to watch it again already.
2,Nostalgia Gone Bad,"I used to have the game stadium checkers when I was kid, which this game is modeled on. But for those of you that also had that game, don't be fooled: this item is half the size of that game and I have no idea why. I was shocked to see how small they made it, or else I have a false image of what it used to be like. I am pretty sure they used regular marbles for the game, but these plastic balls are not much bigger than pellets.The rules of the game, in my opinion, are not entirely clear. Since we got it for Christmas, I tried it once, but didn't find it very exciting, nor did my kids. Cannot recommend."
3,Brooklyn Gere,I am a huge Richard Gere fan so I heard positive things about this movie. It also has Wesley Snipes in it. This movie hits you in the gut and keeps hiting you until the end.
4,Pretty good for gere...,"This is one of those movies that usually show the last first and the first last, I hate those movies ! This movie should of run the last first and so on.This shows how in New York the cops shoot first and write the report to fit the evidence. No one yells ""STOP-POLICE"" ""DROP YOUR WEAPON""."
1,More Hollywood Garbage,"Yet another movie to lead us to believe that all cops are corrupt, addicted, bumbling idiots who only enforce the law to further their own agendas. Criminals, however, are honorable upright guys unjustly persecuted by the police. These movies are boringly predictable. Hey Hollywood, here's an interesting plot twist for you, now listen carefully: Make a movie where the cops are the good guys, and the criminals are the bad guys. Throw this one away."
2,A Surprisingly BAD Movie,"A lot of errors. Cops that are worthless as cops and who don't follow SOP. Too much of the ""it's not my area"" mentality when they're a couple of blocks away. Just a hint. Cops are STATE certified.Some of the best actors in country, whose talents are wasted in this movie. One of few realisms is when Richard Gere's character retires and the department keeps his badge. When Snipes character killed in hit/drive-by, they just leave him where he falls.If you want to see the movie, rent it or watch it on OnDemand. Don't waste your money. It was all I could do to finish watching it."
3,"Fine if you like gritty, dirty and reveling in the bad side of humanity","This film has fine writing and acting.So why did I not like it ?It essentially spends 2 hours showing the worst of human behaviour in our modern day Urban environments.The older I get, the more I am repulsed and disgusted with places like New York or Los Angeles.Let me live in the middle of 4,000 acres of land where I don't have to see modern, ""civilized"" society very often.So maybe the movie deserves a higher rating since it does a great job showing how miserable life can be in large urban areas.Ughhh ... it must be horrible to have to live this way.Crooked cops, miserable lives, dirty streets, foul language, con artists, scammers, stoolies and pigeons ........... this film has it all."
3,Good movie,"This movie has 3 stories intertwined with each other. I like these kind of movies; some are excellent like ""Crossing Over"" and ""Traffic"" some are mediocre like ""Babel"" and some are plain bad like ""Staten Island"". This is a good movie, defiantly recommended. Spike Lee has a short part in it reminiscence of Nino Brown Ethan Hawk is good and Don Cheadle is great. Edan Aharony."
1,Really?,"This movie was so god-awful BORING! Remember Righteous Kill with Al Pacino and Robert De Niro? Ya ... at least that movie was somewhat entertaining. RIGHTEOUS KILL was nothing but a slow moving train wreck with a plot that promised good things, but then failed to deliver on any of it.Come on Hollywood!!! You know its a bad day when I'd prefer to watch an Uwe Boll movie over this rubbish."
3,Disappointed,"This was definitely not ""Brooklyn's Finest"" at all. For the heavy hitters acting in this movie, it was a disappointment.It will never stand the test of time like a New Jack City. Glad I didn't pay to see it in the movies."
1,Hollywood's Worst,"What an awful boring movie! Hardly deserving the one star I'm giving it! How could a group of such professional actors produce such a lifeless crap? With the exception of Wesley Snipes who brings joy to every scene he's on, the other ""great"" actors are clueless and flat-out uninteresting. As if there's a competition amongst them: Let's see who could be more boring this time. Mr. Richard Gere: That scene with you and the hooker didn't help either other than trashing your long acting career. There's plenty of free porn available on the Internet to feed a sex-starved viewer. We didn't need that from you! And don't give us that BS about the movie trying to be realistic and reflect life in the inner city. This is just trash at its worst.Don't waste your money. This film is not entertaining, educational, funny, adventurous, or anything worth watching."
1,Very disappointed,"When I purchased this product, I really believed that I was purchasing the video and what I got was the trailer. It was an extreme disappointment and a waist of money."
1,Disappointed,"The whole movie was 3 lackluster and depressing plots going in tandem, all the while never really converging. I expected there to be some grand merging of the story to create this ""WHOA"" moment...but alas and alack. They converged all right, and went straight past each other, leaving the whole movie feeling rather hollow in the end."
2,"Quality acting, sub par story and writing............","I had high hopes for Brooklyn's Finest. I mean, how can you go wrong with the likes ofRichard Gere , Ethan Hawke and the great Don Cheadle? (not to mention Wesley Snipes who in an ironic twist is getting OUT of prison) The answer is: Ho-Hum seen-it-all-before writing. Instead of a solid satisfying story you get predictable and highly gratuitous violence. Just when things start to look like MAYBE the story is going somewhere, you get the tried and true (or not so true in this case)plot device of separate lives colliding. IN this case I found myself saying ""So What"" ? If pointless and depressing with a story that ultimately goes nowhere is what you are after, then this movie will be very satisfying. If not, look elsewhere to kill a few hours. Hitting yourself on the head with a hammer comes to mind. (ok, it isn't quite THAT bad)"
3,Not what I thought,"I didn't expect a ""feel good"" movie but this was so negative and disappointing I was surprised."
4,Worth Owning,"The best stories in this collection are simply amazing, but there are some that leave the reader a little cold (though isn't that the case with every short story collection?). All in all, it is worth the purchase. And Wideman is one of the most imporant contemporary authors and therefore merits reading just to know what's going on in literature these days.[Side Note: I had the good fortune of doing a workshop with Mr Wideman, and he is also a wonderful human being--kind, funny, intelligent--so you can rest assured that your money is going to a good place.]"
5,The Light-hearted makeup wars,"This movie is a wonderful, light-hearted look at Mary Kay vs. Beauty Control and the personality differences of their founders. It's fun EVEN for MK and BC Beauty Consultants if they don't take themselves too seriously!Definitely a FUN girlfriends movie! However, keep in mind that neither Mary Kay nor Beauty Control had any input into the making of this movie. Additionally, the film makers took about 35 years of activity and portrayed it as though it all happened in just a couple of years. That's Hollywood!!Donna"
1,Battle of Mary Kay,Best part of the movie was the ending. Surprised as Shirley MacLaine is a favorite actress of mine. Always superior acting.
1,Stopped Working,"I ignored other customer reviews thinking that maybe I'd be luckier than others who bought this watch. I won't make that mistake again. Trust the reviews! The watch we got went dead after only 8 weeks, so we replaced the battery. Afterward, the watch made a garbled, screeching noise for about one day before the display went blank for good. I wouldn't buy another."
1,Fell apart in less than two weeks wrist band broke,"We bought this item and within a couple of weeks it just broke at the hinge on the watch. I was really impressed for the first two weeks, but then it broke. I hate cheaply made materials."
2,Talking watch,"I originally had a mans talking watch but wanted to try a Ladies version. When I got the watch and put it on, the way too delicate clasp broke. I went back to the sturdy men's variety."
4,Pretty good,"I was a little dissapointed when i watched this movie for the first time. I thought it could have been a lot better with some better interviews, and some more vidoes. It does have 3 great videos on it, one of them being the awesome ""spit it out"" which is a great song, and when combined with a great video based on the movie ""The Shining"" it makes it even better. If you are a Slipknot fan, this movie is a must!"
5,This is what the Knot is all about!,"This video is excellent! I recommend this to anyone that's a new fan or even an old fan like myself. Why? BECAUSE YOU SHOULD! Hell, you have the posters, you have the CD's, hopefully you avoided that ""Behind the Mask DVD"" like herpes and really, what else could you spend a little money on?I gotta admit it's only 20 some minutes long but it's still worth it. Seriously, go up to the top of the page, click the mouse on the button that says buy it. You know you want to."
4,Good one.,Nice and simple little camera with REALLY GOOD sensitivity. Works really well for my wife.
3,I think there's some hysteria going on here.,"Here's the deal about the F20, it's a great little camera for a point and shoot. This little guy is turbo charged. It fires up in a split second eager to take pictures. But it's low light performance is being exaggerated. It's not the camera's fault really, they put a restrictor plate on it. It's true that the F20 has the same guts as it's bigger brother F30, but the F30 has much more horsepower, and the reason why? MANUAL CONTROLS. You simply cannot take advantage of the high ISO's without some shutter control. If this isn't your bag, then you should be okay. But the real low-light performer is the F30."
4,nice little camera,"My son has had this camera since December and really likes it, so when I needed a new one I got the same. I like that there's very little lag time between shots, something that had always bothered me when trying to capture a cute shot of my grandchildren. The only minus is that one must use the LCD screen as a viewer before shooting, and that's difficult to see in bright sunlight. But the small size and low price make buying this one a no-brainer!"
2,cheap ruler,I should have purchased a higher quality rule. This one was bent to fit in the box and is too flimsy. The markings are difficult to read. Poorly made in general.Mike
5,Camp Chef Large Utility Table,Purchased this to use with our Boy Scout Troop when we are dutch oven cooking. The description provided is accurate and will easily accomodate up to two 16 inch dutch ovens.
3,"Beautiful at first, but short lived.","Bonsai are a lot harder to take care of than I expected. It stayed beautiful for a long time then slowly died, no matter what I did."
3,not what i expected,"Very dry but informative book on election.I believe the author is from England,perhaps thats why the way he wrote it was so dry and too intellectual.I have another book about election that was vey informative and yet a child could understand it and come away with knowing election as well.Some authors need to remember that you need to keep it simple and keep the cookie jar where everyone can get to them,not just ""tall"" people."
5,Terrific Reference Guide,"This is a five star effort in terms of providing all the insider details about the Japanese monster movies I loved as a kid, shunned as a young adult and am now rediscovering again. For the first time, some context into what those Japanese filmmakers were doing and on top of that, clear coherent explanations of the FX and why to them what American audiences think of as cheap looking was state of the art for its day in Japan (we even learn such gems why the dubbing we hear in English is always so bad, and why the current versions of the original Gamera film no longer contain any of the footage with Brian Donlevy and Albert Dekker).About the only quibble might be some of the author's reviews of the films in one section (""King Kong Escapes"" is really a bad film no matter how you cut it) but that's a minor thing compared to the treasure trove of intellectual junk food this book provides. If you enjoyed watching these movies in your innocent youth, then get it!"
2,Not a good book,"The book tried to introduce new ""theories"" in every paragraph. I'd rather see something practical."
5,masterpiece,This is a great book. The mathematical exposition is excellent and the historical footnotes are extremely interesting.
3,The cliff notes make it easier to understand this gay book.,"i found that these notes really make it easy to understand this gay book. I hated the book the first time..and i hate it still. I can't believe we have to read this book in class...come on...And besides...what moral values are we going to have if we keep reading books with preachers that commit adultry...or any other person for that matter. ok..Grapes of Wrath, The Crucible, the Scarlet Letter...and others...they all suck...puh-lease."
2,"Parev Marta, yes ayl Haye em!","I only read the first chapter of this book, and it was pretty boring. I got the cliffs notes, and it went by A LOT faster. Still got an A in the class too. Ew, but the book had such a nasty ending! ugh.....[yero says as he smiles mysteriously]..."
3,Boring with a Message,"I had to read this book over the summer for my English class and I dreaded it. I love to read however I hate John Steinbeck. From The Red Pony to Of Mice & Men, his style is confusing and strange. I tried to read it fast to end the pain quickly but towards the middle of the book, it got somewhat interesting and I realized that Steinbeck was just using the Joad family to show what had happened during the Great Depression and after. The Joad family was just one of millions of families suffering and he was using the Joads to send a message. The ending of this book is disgusting and it is one of the worst endings I have ever read. Good Luck if you have to read the book."
2,This book is the most boring book I have ever read,I hated reading this book because of it's style. It is very confusing to read the book. Thank god I'm done with it and after this I'll never anything that John Steinbeck wrote. Oh by the The ending is the nastiest thing that I ever read or imagined to be in a book.
4,great movies,"Great movies and great on blue ray, sucks that ""nemesis"" was such a crappy movie, but it was part of the collection so gooe enough to keep."
1,NO QUALITY CONTROL,ORDERED BLU RAY STARTREK 4 PACK. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO THEM IN BLU RAY.I WAS READING NOTHINGBUT GOOD REVIEWS. WHAT I GOT WAS THE STANDARD DVDS. YOU GUESSED IT IM SENDING THEM BACK. THE BEST PART IS IT TAKES 4 WEEKS FOR A REFUND.
5,Can't Go Wrong,"You really can't go wrong with these movies by themselves. Put them on Blu Ray , box them together, then throw in a bunch of special features that I never watch but its nice to know are there and you've got a real winner."
5,SPOCK WHO ????,"I am not a Freakin' TREKIE !!!! I do, however, enjoy these films !!! I enjoy the NEXT GENERATION films much more than the original series films. I'm sorry, but the KILLER WHALES one was stupid !!! KIRK and SPOCK are playing with whales and the NEXT GENERATION gives us the BORG !!!!! No comparison !!!"
4,A Classic,"The classic Need For Speed title. It did for racing games what Mortal Kombat did for fighting games - introduced a new level of quality and realism. Great graphics, gameplay and music. You can get the PC version or play the PSX one with an emulator if you don't have a PSX/PS2."
1,Stopped working,Worked for about two month then lost it's stickiness and fell off. Was pretty expensive too! Would not recommend purchasing this... search for alternatives.
3,But you must mount close to the bottom back edge,"These feet will work fine IF you can mount them close to the back edge. My back edge has two problems, a bump where the battery is encased, and a cooling vent. So I tried mounting them 2.25 inches from the back edge. Doing so, when the screen is opened the computer becomes ""back heavy"" and the keyboard will be lifted up off the desk. Beware."
2,What would Gloria Steinem think!!,"I bought this toy for my son and I figured if it turns out too 'girly' I would give it to my niece.As it turned out, it is definitely not adequae for my son but it is definitely more adequate for my son than my niece! It has also gender neutral issues. Let me give a couple of examples and if I have time one day I will give more specifics:This toy has sophisticated electronics but the design behind it seems lacking. For example, it will give negative feedback for choosing the wrong answer but I will not give any feedback if you chose the right answer:-)The toy is designed to encourage vanity and other undesirable traits and feels like it was designed by someone who has a sterotypical and negative view of what American girls are like. More later got to go..Probably designed by some insensitive backward male out there.. And my apologies to all the good guys out there. I know there are a lot of you out there and I am married to one of them:-)"
4,This has mixed reviews from my family.,"My husband thought that the picture looked nice and bought the pendant. He did not like it since the snake is not well defined. *However*, my teenage son loved the pendant. He thought it was 'cool'. He didn't have any problem with how the snake looked.So based on two people's opinions, I gave this pendant a mixed review."
5,Loveable...,"This is a great album, though only four songs, it's very dramatic and emotional. I guess you could call it art rock. I loved it!"
3,Some decent information,"If you are unfamiliar with smart drugs, this is a very approchable introduction. Just be cautious of some of the very intriguing customer comments. If they sound too good to be true, try the product they mention and find out for yourself. While I find smart drugs to produce a noticable effect, I haven't applied to any joint M.D./J.D. programs yet"
2,Great size for younger children.,My kids loved it but my 4 year old complained that one did not work within hours of me setting it up. I checked and sure enough there were extra screws rattling around in the controller. Too bad because they are compact and the kids really liked them so much that I did order another set to see if this is a random manufacturing glitch.
5,kalmah has a cool tentacle,"According to my son: very fun building toy. squid shooter doesn't work well, but I still like the toy a lot. I recommend it for 6 and older. I like the way he looks and would suggest anyone buy him."
3,"Been there, done that",I was at the performance in San Jose Ca. Seeing him in person was different than seeing him on TV.He got to get away with alot more than any censor would have let him broadcast.It will be good to see pieces of the other performances as well.
3,"He really, really just can't stop",More revealing than it needed to be. Not as revealing as we'd like it to be. The performance footage focuses more on music than comedy. The movie certainly supports it's contention that Conan O'Brien can't stop - and that he's happiest and most fulfilled in front of an audience.
1,The strings will get caught into the fan,"When you run it, the strings will get caught in the fan and that's the end of this glider. They should re-design the glider."
5,encouraging!,"I had to read this book over the summer for school last year and at first, I thought it was too long and all this history about India; but as you read on you really get a glimpse into his life and how God changed Ravi is so cool and it shows that God can do anything, I really recommend this for people who need encouragement. :)"
2,Mediocre,"The 1986 edition of the book starts out saying that it is not ""a course in how to construct knowledge-based systems (page v preface)"" and that is so true. As the book attempts to give an informative overview of various expert system techniques it fails to clearly communicate them due to its lack of clear ""how to"" instructions which are absolutely necessary to explain the complex principles covered. I have a Master's degree in Communications myself and find this book to be one of the types assigned to students due to its industry status rather than because it gets the job of education done."
1,Get Togethers,Bought for a gift and dj was bent and dirty. I returned the book and Amazon sealed my loyalty with their easy and courteous return customer service. Thanks Amazon. Also the recipes were already circulated in this area so there was nothing new for me but the illustrations were great.
4,Very in-depth and very intense,"Just a warning - don't plan to start this if you don't have some level of fitness to start. There are some minimum requirements for fitness or the program will be incredibly difficult. You also need to have or buy some other equipment including weights or resistance bands and a chin-up bar. That said, it is a very in-depth program that not only includes exercise but dietary plans."
1,Very disappointed,This product arrived on time but DID NOT work. 6 out of the 12 DVD's were scratched. We sent them back and haven't gotten anything in return for 3 months! This is UNACCEPTABLE and we should receive a credit for this product. The item was not in usable condition therefore we should be receiving a complete refund of our money! The follow through has been terrible and I will never buy anything from this seller again. I highly recommend checking the product before purchasing anything from this seller. Very poor follow through and assistance to an expensive item.
2,DO NOT BUY THIS BEFORE YOU GET SOME CONDITIONING FOR THESE INTENSITIES!,This is death to all who have not exercised before these dvd's. It's almost impossible to do before being conditioned
2,Already feeling a little buyer's remorse,"After receiving the product and going through it in considerable detail, I realize that it is an awfully complicated program with a lot of up-sell.The books it comes with are cheaply produced with tiny type and terrible design - not to mention difficult to make sense of. The DVDs sound quality is poor.The pull-up bar came missing a nut and two washers.I have used the Body-For-Life system by Bill Phillips and love it. Much more simple, straightforward and easy to understand - and certainly no less effective. And all you need to do is buy a $25 book at any bookstore - or here at Amazon - and Boom! You're done. The BFL program is somewhat more weightlifting oriented, but a set of adjustable dumbells and a bench is all you really need. Same results. The tone is much more inspirational and humble than rambling Tony is. They also have a website that is FAR more easy to navigate AND it's FREE.Not very impressed with P90x."
4,Workin It Hard!,Keeps you movin and not cheesy like some of the workout programs that are out there. Tony is constantly changing up the exercises and this is anything but routine! Daily time spent per workout is around 60 minutes so if you can't commit to that then this product probably isn't for you.
1,Scott MacKerron,I ordered this product off the of the TV ad and was double charged and totally ripped off. Don't do business with Team Beach Body !!! RUN DON'T WALK AWAY FROM THIS COMPANY !!!!!
2,dvd's suck,"Ok i just started the workout and i love it, its very hard at first but i just keep pushin my self. The reason for only 2 stars is because the dvd's suck. I got the cardiox out and tried to use it for the first time and it was skipping bad. For as much as you pay for the program they should atleast make sure the material last the whole 90 days. so think about your pick."
1,Bad disks,"This review is specific to the disks I received and not in anyway a negative review of the program itself (as I didn't get to try the program, I cannot provide a review on its effectiveness).I was very excited to receive this product. I've suffered numerous injuries in the past year and was hoping to get started on a new routine. I suffered an injury that prevented me from beginning this workout for about 8 weeks after receipt of product. The first disk skips and pauses on its own, which was annoying but I thought I could deal with it. I tried to use the second disk today and it does not play at all in my DVD player. I then tried to play it from my laptop and it crashed the machine. I was quite excited to begin this workout but now I will be returning the defective product."
5,Good Workout,"Don't buy into the hype that this is a one-of-a-kind workout. It's not. I've been in the Marine Corps since 2008 and have seen many variations of similar workouts, and they all teach many if not all of the same principles. The marketing world is probably the worst enemy for serious, or would be serious fitness buffs because they buy into all the crap people talk about programs like p90X.The program is based on solid principles, and if you're willing to see it through to the end of the three months, you'll see great results. The key to a program like this is consistency. The program provides for things like recovery time, flexibility and endurance training, so it is a pretty complete package. I would recommend this workout for anyone seriously wanting to get in shape. You can do the program at your own pace, as long as you are consistent, so there's no reason you should let your current shape stop you... just take it easy if you're trying to start on this program."
3,Video is good,"This is the workouts only, it doesn't include the book or schedule on how to do them. Its hard though and if your used to working out, I recommend it."
3,Good workout---ANNOYING Instructor,"I find the workout to be good, he has them laid out in a good sequence, especially the weight training, yoga and plyometrics. However, some of the moves like on the Kenpo are a little too choreographed and I find that I am wasting time trying to figure out how to do them rather than working out. Also some of the people in certain dvd's have awful form...I am a personal trainer and I specialize in classical pilates, so I am all about form. There also seems to be some ""fluff"", when you can just do a basic push up, or crunch he has you doing all this funky stuff, which is where I saw people struggling with form.The downfall to P90X is Tony, the instructor, ANNOYS the hell out of me. One of those guys that has those cheesy one liners.....gets on my last good freaking nerve!!!Make sure if you order you get a book or PDF file with the lay out of the workout, otherwise you will get the 13 DVD's and not know what to do with them."
1,don't purchase!,"My purchase of P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner by Beachbody came to me quickly and packaged well however the CDs do not work properly! They are unreadable in all my DVD players and my computer. Thankfully I have a portable DVD player that reads them so I have to attach that to my TV to do the videos. Do not waste your money on purchasing this set because chances are they will not work for you. Spend a little more and buy it from the actual website!P90X Extreme Home Fitness Workout Program - 13 DVDs, Nutrition Guide, Exercise Planner"
3,Diet not good for diabetics,"The workout itself deserves 10 stars. I've done it and I'll definitely do it again.However, the food plan isn't for everyone. I'm diabetic and the first part of the food plan is ok. But when they start to add carbs back in to the plan it goes awry. By the third month they've added lots of refined carbs (pasta) and that's a no-no. They also shy away from healthy fats like olive oil and coconut oil.I tried eating their way and I found my blood sugar went way up and I gained weight. I had to go back to eating low glycemic veggies in order to get my glucose levels to normal.So, if you have diabetes, please ignore the food plan and stick to what your doctor/nutritionist/dietician told you to eat.Other than that the workout is fantastic, challenging, and well worth doing. It'll really firm you up. I put on a few pounds of pure muscle in the 3 months I was on the program."
3,Great workout...if you have the time,"I have zero doubt P90X can get you in great shape, provided you have the time to devote to the program. If you are thinking of starting P90X be prepared to devote 75-90 minutes a day, 6 days a week to it. If you have kids and a job and can stick with this program, more power to you.The other thing I'd like to note is you need to be in good shape before starting. This is a very advanced workout routine. If you're dead set on trying P90X but not in the greatest shaped, I'd go through one of Tony Horton's other programs first like Power 90.Overall, I found it to be a mixed bag: A phenomenal workout that I had a hard time finding enough time for, and dreading when I did have the time."
5,best workout ever,"worth it, every bit, this is no fake workout, you will see results in two weeks. your belly will be flat in one month, i tell you the truth."
5,Just as advertised,"The only thing holding me back from purchasing this product was the price. I have purchased other exercise items and was somewhat skeptical. I decided to buy ""used"" and the ad said it was still in the box, unopened. Sure enough it was and I got it for only $82. The content is excellent and this will no doubt be the best workout series yet!Thanks,Rob"
5,p90x,"I Truly liked it, been trying it for two months now, and I See improvments in all areas just need to keep doing it and bringing it basically stay commited and do your best my bro was big and he did nt do no workouts or working out ever since he got it he got pretty slim in two months no lie! (MAKES YOU SWEAT BIG TIME)"
5,Great program!,"I'm in my 4th week of P90X and I'm really enjoying it. Seeing results already. For those of you who think it's too hard, I'm female, 52 yrs old, not overweight, and was in reasonable shape before I started the program. It's difficult at times, but not impossible. I wanted something challenging so I would get results, and that's what P90X is. There is lots of room for modifying the moves until you get stronger. The key is to stick with the program, make it a priority in your schedule, and make healthy changes to your diet. I love that there is so much variety in this program...I don't get bored. I recommend this program!"
3,defective DVD in set - cannot exchange just one,"How sad. Multiple days into the routine and enjoying the product. DVD #11 is defective. The manufacturer won't do anything about it so I called Amazon. They can only exchange the entire set. So now I have to figure out if I should stop the entire routine, wait for an exchange, and then start over ... or what. Live with one missing dvd?? Ugh. Beware of faulty dvds."
5,Love it,Everything was there that was said to be there. I had no problems receiving it. There were no scratches on the product.
4,Great home workout,"The only bad thing about this set is the fact that 1 or 2 of the cd's skip. They still work, I just have to put them in my laptop instead of a tv dvd player."
2,i guess you get what you pay for,"i spent 70dols on the P90X DVDs but 5 dvds are messed up. They pause, freeze, and skip. i feel like i got what i paid for. I tried to go cheap but most of the DVDs are useless. This is my first and last time ordering from this site."
1,Rating the quality of USED product,Just order this set from Beach Body directly. They'll replace DVDs as they get worn. Something that would have been nice for the person that tried to sell me used DVDs that wouldn't play.
2,Boy did I learn a Valuable Lesson!,"I purchased an Used ""Almost New"" version of P90X from Zoey's DVD Cafe (99% reliable) and found a couple of dvds (CardioX & XStretch) are unable to play because they severely scratched. When I contacted Amazon regarding the scratched dvds, I was informed from Amazon that, ""Zoey's DVD has left the Amazon.com platform and unable to receive any further email communication"". I even contacted BeachBody.com and they told me to contact the person I bought it from.I learned a valuable lesson and will never ever buy USED DVDs or CDs online again!"
5,P90x,"I was bored with the same old exercises. Treadmill, basic weight exercises, some stretching. I hadn't pushed myself for years. P90x changed all that. I look forward to the challanges of each days routine. It's different every day and it kicks my butt. I have alread lost two inches from my waist and lowered my resting pulse by 3 beats per minute and I'm only in my 4th week. I highly recommend it. I'm 62 and getting younger every day."
4,Exactly as described,"The product was brand new exactly as described and was all complete. I haven't had a chance to use or try it yet since I broke my foot two weeks ago, but I'm sure it will be everything I hoped. The seller is recommended."
5,Effective Program,"After several weeks of doing P90X with the diet, I am able to run and play with my kids again. I have been tight all my life, day 14 I touched my toes for the first time EVER with a straight leg. I have lost 9 lbs and feel much better. Well worth the sweat equity."
3,Only one problem,For some reason seven of the discs cause my PS3 player to vibrate. Have not encountered this at any other time with any other DVD bought or rented.
1,So disappointed!,"I looked forward to starting this exercise program and enjoyed the exercises on the second disc (the first disc is an intro to the program), however first it worked fine in one laptop computer but it suddenly became inoperable. I placed the disc in another laptop computer and it worked so I was able to complete the day one exercise routine. However, the next day while I was working out to the third disc it stopped playing and I was unable to restart it on any available DVD player. I was so disappointed because I liked the exercises. I do not have the patience for DVDs not working so I returned this item and did not try to exchange it. I am hoping that eventually they will have something more convenient like an i-phone app."
5,Amazing! Better results in 3 months than I've seen with a year's worth of free-weight training,"First off, I am 5'9'' and around 160lbs. I have been training at the local gym using free-weights and dumb-bells for almost 5 years and wasn't satisfied. I started this program in May and have seen amazing results. Instead of following the included diet, I decided to become vegetarian (I'll eat fish about once a month out of boredom) and I have the best chest, back, and abdominal areas in my life. In my honest opinion, order the 5 or 6 pack Ripcords Resistance Bands if you have not seen satisfying results with normal weights"
4,everything as promissed,"Easy to use , I do recomend this item . Take care on diet , exercises , but disregard all other things the p90x's want to sell you ..."
2,Authentic Copy?,I question authenticity of the copy I received. The guide book is full of typos. I suspect it was transcribed by an non-english speaking person.
2,problem with some of the DVDs,We enjoy the workouts when the DVDs work. There are a few of the DVDs (e.g. Core Synergistics & Chest Shoulder and Triceps) that seem to refuse to be played. We have tried PCs/laptops as well as stand alone players.From what has been read from some reviews and on other sites the DVDs sold on Amazon are of inferior quality to those sold directly through BeachBody. It makes one believe that BeachBody is willing to forgo quality in the hopes that you will purchase the set again at additional cost from them directly.Or the other possibility is that the Amazon DVDs are pirated versions. Be careful purchasing these.
5,P90X is proven and it works - see for yourself,"You know I love P90X. This seller is selling it for more money than beachbody is so it is a ripoff.From beachbody, 139.80.From this seller, 155.56Don't let this negative feedback about the seller affect your choice to buy P90X. Get it from Beachbody."
2,I you want to follow it be prepared to spend 1K or more...,"It is a good program, just the way it's advertised is very missleading. It's not for beginners, it assumes the level of endurance and strength. I consider it a rip off if I have to buy entire gym, additional diet books and special supplements. So if you want to follow it, be prepared to spend some cash..."
1,"BEWARE ""USED"" or ""CHEAP"" COPIES","I am not writing about the actual P90X program or anything like that. There are illegal/bootleg copies of P90X floating around out there. The DVDs skip, the case is misprinted, and the Nutrition and Fitness guides are full of factual, spelling and grammatical errors.I suggest just buying a new copy from Amazon, or buying from the actual site (the price is the same).Do not make the same mistake I did, and don't waste your time!"
5,Amazing,P90x was all that I hoped it was and more. I started seeing results after the second week of the workout. It's part of my everyday routine and makes a stressful day much better. I love this product.
5,P90X,Outstanding workout routine that will push you to your limits and beyond! I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to step up your workout routine and go past the walls that are keeping you from achieving your best physique.
1,Lots of potential but don't stand behind faulty dvds,"This could be a great program IF they would stand behind their DVD's.The DVD's are cheap quality and they charge something like $40 to replace a defective one. If I get a defective DVD, and am willing to return it, they shoudl replace it for free. As someone else said the copy protection is really lousy. I like to travel with my IPAD and I can't burn the DVD's to my IPAD to use when travelling or use on my laptop. It means carrying my portable DVD player if I want to use them when on the road.This program has a lot of potential if the DVD's worked or they would replace them. I just can't give anything higher than 1 star to a company that doesn't replace a defective product."
5,Life changing,"I NEVER buy anything from a television add. I was surprised at myself when I called in and made the purchase. I have worked through the DVDs twice. I would recommend this for everyone. I'm looking for teammates to start again. I lost 30 lbs and decreased 2 inches in my waist. I feel so much better mentally and physically. I have never really been athletic and I can't believe I made it through the workouts. It takes a lot of commitment and about an 1.25 hours a day except for the typical 4th day of the week which will take about 1.75 hours. If you purchase the program, enjoy and just stick with it! Oh... and by the way... do your Yoga!"
5,P90X Rocks!,I've just about completed my first 30 days on P90X and although I've only seen minimal changes physically so far it's been a blast working out with Tony H. and the boys.
2,The Yoga sucks.,You need to be fit to use this program and pass the fitness test. The P90x Yoga is 1 1/2 hours long. Take small breaks and it's 2 hours long. I did so many up-dogs that I lost count and hurt my back in the process. I was out of work for 3 days. I never touched p90x after that. Find a program that is shorter and easier on the spine!
1,Not in that good of condition,The first one we ordered wouldn't play on the computer and the sound went in and out on the tv. We contacted the person the sent us another one the worked for a week and then the same thing happened and the second time I tried to contact the person I received no response. Not worth a 100 bucks at all!!!!!
1,DEFECTIVE!!,I really enjoy the p90x dvds however when i recieved the product some of DVD's did not work. Infact 3 out of 5 DVDS were defective. I was so frustrated I did not even attempt to play the others. I did recieve a refund for my items but had to pay the shipping. I will not order from the same person again.
3,really?,the dvds themselves are the correct dvds. its just the quality is really poor. the cases they come in are horrible. it's like they WANT them to be scratched. i took them out and put them into a seperate cd case..
5,Intense!,"P90X is not for the weak! Tony really pushes you and you want to keep up. It is excellent for those who are already on the ""fitness train."" The variety of the workouts is great! Read the fitness book that comes along with it to decide which routine works best for you. I started the classic P90X and then discovered the lean p90X which is what I wanted. So, instead of being on week three, I'm only on week two with the lean routine. I want that bikini body. I want to be that girl who takes her boyfriend with her to find that perfect bathing suit. I've never done that before. Who wants their significant other to see the rolls? Not me! ""BRING IT"" as Tony says. With the videos, I now only have brief ""meetings"" with my treadmill. Oh well!"
3,fingers crossed,"I just ordered this, hasn't come in the mail yet. I am a beginner of this work out, I have been seeing this on TV, and would constantly say this is a lie, those results aren't real. I am an over weight (150lb (aiming for 112-127 at least))5ft tall girl, I have been trying to lose weight, but was just never really motivated and could not find the right workouts for myself, well I'm done sitting on the couch waiting for things to change. I am hoping that once trying this, I will get the results I am looking for. once I get this going I will color the stars it deserves."
2,Not happy with it,I brought it from a dealer on amazon and I did'nt get the nutrition guide or exercise planner. I just got the dvds and the package was really beat up. If I had seen a picture of what I was getting before hand I would not have brought it for $80.
2,Horrible spelling and grammar!,"I have not started the program yet, however I am appalled by the 18 grammar and spelling errors in the first few pages alone. Extremely unprofessional. I am now worried to open the DVD's after the reviews I have read. How hard is it to fix a few spelling errors before printing and shipping to the customers? Especially considering that it is recommended to read the booklets FIRST, thus it is the first product that the customer will see! Embarrassing!I will finish my review once I get my workouts started.....wish me luck that the booklets are the only problem!"
1,Have not recieve it yet!!!,"I haven't recieve the P90X yet. Its been more than a month now, and nothing. I'm very desapointed with the service."
3,Bought it used in perfect condition.,"Bought P90x CD box set recently and the ABs Cd does not respond at all. All the others, have so far. I havent tried them all out though yet, so hopefully it is just the ABs that doesnt work. I think in the future, I will buy something like that brand new at full price and not used just because I wanted to save money and get it cheaper."
4,Everything included,"This was an amazing deal, and everything was brand new! Nothing was open, missing , or scratched. The box was not even opened! The menu is really great for healthy recipes, and the schedule is easy to follow."
5,AWESOME,This workout is amazing. The first week was so hard but the second week went much better. I'm already seeing results. I can't wait to see what is next for me.
4,StretchX DVD was blank,"The program is great. Our only problem was that the StretchX DVD was blank when we went to use it. Going to try to get a replacement on that. Otherwise, we are very happy with the fitness program."
5,Clever idea,"I have used a lot of tools in my time so its always great to see small changes that are actually big improvements to everyday tools. Last month when I was installing lights in my celling the numbers on the bottom made it easy to see and mark accurate measurements when standing on the ladder by myself.This product is very well build and rugged, the rubberized case makes it extra nice."
1,Insatiable Needs,I ordered what was stated as an XXX rated version and received a copy of what can only be classified as an R rated version. I was very disapointed.
4,4.5 stars for The Human Stain,"In this book Roth sets the story of an African- American college professor who has spent his adult life ""passing: as white against the backdrop of the Clinton -Monica Lewinsky scandal. The character of Coleman Silk is shattered by an ironic and unfair accusation of racism at the school that forces him to end his career while preserving his secret. He begins an affair with a female janitor at the school who is divorced from an angry and unbalanced VietNam Vet from whom she had suffered abuse. Her tragic past collides with SIlk's tragic present resulting in the story's slow build toward a disasterous end. An American tragedy that has people victimized by circumstances beyond their control as well as by their own decisions , the Human Stain is a complex story that examines hypocrisy and racial, economic and social biases in American Society."
1,A Bore,"This was one of the most boring reads I have ever encountered. I loved his book ""The Plot Against America,"" but this put me to sleep just trying to read it!"
5,Wow what a read,"I have never read Philip Roth, and was not interested in doing so, though I have seen his books in bookstores for years. I am an avid reader, and love great books...I decided to give Plot Against America a try, and was hooked.I then read A Human Stain and have just finished American Pastoral. This book welcomes you into a world that is definitely finite, complex, interesting. I can't imagine that the movie that was made out of this book could surpass its literary beauty, and its deep language. Highly recommended!"
5,Roth's Stain exposes the stain in all of us,"Wow! I have nothing but praise for this exceptional novel. Roth's characters are honest. Human longings and needs are explored in a beautifully written and entertaining fashion. As always, Roth delivers a book that raises questions of the human condition, and exposes us to ourselves. Chalk full of great insights, truth, and humor. One that you'll want to own and will have trouble putting down. Philip Roth has created yet another masterpiece."
2,Not the great American novel...,"I thought that the premise of the book was fascinating but I could not help feeling that Roth wrote this novel with the goal of writing THE GREAT AMERICAN NOVEL. Well, sadly, it falls short. The characters are unlikeable and with the exception of Coleman Silk, not well defined. There are two characters who are introduced right at the end of the book and it's not clear to me why they appear in the story at all. Many of the characters are too lightly drawn. All that said, the book did have some positive qualities. Roth's description of how Coleman's secret evolved was masterful and very credible. I would have enjoyed the book much more had Roth focused his energies there. I found the Faunia/Les Farley story much less interesting or engaging. After all of the glowing reviews I had read, I was disappointed in The Human Stain."
2,A minor achievement,"Nowhere near as good as Roth can be. Although it contains flashes of great writing the overall experience is pretty tedious. In addition to the Vietnam war vet cliche discussed in other reviews the attempt to intergrate the Monica Lewinsky scandal into the fabric of the narrative calls to mind Joe Eszterhaus' horrible ""American Rhapsody."" The story itself is very disorganized and given the basic premise -- a light skinned black man passing for white accused of making racially loaded comments -- there is a surprising lack of irony. Needed to be revised, but when you're Philip Roth what editor is going to have the guts to send you back to the drawing board?"
4,The Human Stain--a present-day masterpiece!,"I do hope the potential readers of this book (and those who plan to see the movie) won't take ""countesscocca"" too seriously in her one-star, mean-spirited review! Trust your gut instincts about all the intricate weaving of this story-telling by Roth...and enjoy the ride with the characters all the way to the end. You won't be sorry. And, DO see the movie as well. Naturally, some novels don't translate well or fully to the screen, but this one was handled with care in the script adaptation and by the genius of director Robert Benton."
1,It is not what you think,"I bought this book before there were any reviews on it. With the reviews I have seen so far I would have probably purchased it. If you are stuck in the 60's and still read poems aloud to bongo's, then this is the book for you. I found it bizzare, ludicrous, absurd, a waste of money not to mention a total waste of time. It was a complete dissappointment when I opened it."
1,A qoute from this book...,"The following quote is from this book. ""Christians speak often of the blood of Christ and its cleansing power. Much that is believed and taught on this subject, however, is such utter nonsense and so palpably false that to believe it is to lose one's salvation. Many go so far, for instance, as to pretend and, at least, to believe that if we confess Christ with our lips and avow that we accept Him as our personal Saviour, we are thereby saved. His blood, without other act than mere belief, they say, makes us clean..."""
4,Poems Yeats liked,"I wanted to see what poems of his own time W. B. Yeats choose, after reading a biography of his latter years. This is the book of poetry that he put together for Oxford not long before he died. It is not a comprehensive collection of poetry of the time because it is ideocentric to Yeats, and its not a large collection."
2,Not Practical for the Classroom,"This may be a great resource for homeschooling; however, I did not find much use for it in the classroom."
5,Excellent,I became hooked on this CD after listning to it once. Their version of old standards like Mercy Mercy Mercy coupled with new original tunes shows how talented they are both as performers and writers. I highly recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of jazz.
2,Shallow Interpretations,"Although I appreciated Helen McCarthy's inside information from interviews and her filmography list, I found her analysis of these films very superficial. In short, I feel that any avid fan of Miyazaki could have written this book: it is simply a collection of facts and, as the other negative reviewer said, gushing about the films. There is no in-depth, intellectual engagement with Miyazaki's work."
3,Think of this toy as 50/50,"Well to start this toy was very fun, but after a while I got tired of it and eventually I just took the doll, it's styleish clothes, and dog and didn't play with the plane unless the polly pockets had to go on vacation which only came like once a month.I don't recemend this toy if you don't have any other polly pockets. If you don't your kid will probably only play with it for 3 or 4 days, but your kid can be very creative if they have this toy. So I would get this if you want your kid to be creative."
1,dumb toy,"this is a dumb toy. I have it and it doesn't even tell u da truth. oh $"" atoy enthausanest it doen't even take ur pulse for your info!!!!"
3,Works fine but slow,Wish there was a USB 2.0 version of this device. It works fine but it's quite slow at transferring files. It's useful for emergencies.
1,What do you do with no directions?,"I would love to report how this product is or is not working, but I received it with no instructions in the box or on the bottle.I'm sitting here looking at the bottle wondering what on earth to do with it!"
3,Velocity review,"This is good and bad.The good, the lenses are incredible. I love Serengeti glasses for their clarity. I have flown with them for years and will continue to in the future.The bad, this is the first pair of Serengeti glasses I have owned that have broken. The lense cracked where the frame is screwed together on the side within two months."
4,Not What I Was Looking For,"This book is exactly what the product description says it is. Some of the other reviews say it is a good book for a beginning gardeners. I do not believe that is the case. It is a good resource for a gardener. I needed a book to tell me where do I plant tomatoes and how deep. I just needed general answers to the basic beginning gardener questions, like a walk through building my first garden. The book is basically an ides of what plants do well with each other, which is helpful. The chapter on ""Garden Plan"" was some what helpful on starting to lay out my garden but I needed more. I will definitely keep this book on hand, as I said I think it will be a very useful resource. Just don't be fooled by the reviewers that say this is like a beginners guide to gardening. I found this product helpful and useful but not exactly what I needed/"
4,Keep this handy when doing your garden planning,A great guide to keep handy when planning your gardening season. So much helpful information for how to maximise the productivity of small backyard gardens.
5,classic information,This book is filled with the old fashioned information that our grandparents shared with us. I recommend this book for the many bits of history and time tested knowledge.
1,If you're not a rocket scientist...look elsewhere.,"I couldn't believe how much time it took me to set up a clock radio! The ""control panel"" is far from intuitive. After so many years of setting up digital watches, car radios, stereos, vcrs etc., I rarely use a manual. Not with the ""Dream Machine"" ,however. I can't believe sony would make this so difficult.Once in use, you will NOT be positively impressed with the sound quality or the brightness of the LCD screen. It's a nice green color tho...You can find better for less money. Keep looking!"
4,Couldn't live without it,"If you don't like the color get a different color, mine is black. I'm only 13 years old and I never once had to look at the directions, for the most part it's self-explanatory. My stereo can't even pick up radio stations but my Dream Machine picks them up clear as a bell."
5,SUPERB!,I am a student in the clinical semesters and each page of this book is pure gold. I just bought the second edition (2000). It is fun to read and teaches the kind of medicine I want to practice. Get it.
1,My ears are bleeding,"This cartoon is why so many adults hate 'cartoons.' If you're going to do a show about Sonic in a BAND and hire only one voice actor, why not hire one who can actually sing? They do exist.Painful to listen to, with an animation quality that's equally painful to watch.Possibly the worst drivel the Sonic series has ever produced, and considering some of the lemons they've been willing to slap Sonic's name on, that is saying something.Too bad I will probably have to buy the rest of the series for a young family member, since for some reason, kids too young to have developed taste beyond 'it's animated' love the bad singing and washed out, pathetic excuses for a plot. It barely fits into the rest of the Sonic shows- was probably developed to have other main characters and they slapped Sonic into it just so someone would actually watch it. It'd never have sold without a major character glued on.If your kids haven't seen it, don't let them get started on it. Your ears will thank you."
1,The New Book of Table Settings is a bore,"I was very dissapointed with this book. First, the concentration focused more on center pieces than table settings. It also had some very strange chapters. Example: How to set TV trays. Like I really need to know this? The book also strayed from the subject and focused too much on decorating your home for the holidays.I do not think that this book was worth the investment. It also failed to give any new ""funky"" or modern ideas on how to deecorate tables and that's what I wanted."
3,Fun game that challenges,"I've played this game with my Sunday gaming group. Some of the quotes will test your memory to be sure. Each card has two quotes on it in various categories (movies TV, commercials, etc.). You have one minute to get both quotes. First player or team whose piece reaches the finish line wins. We usually play in teams because we've found that in some cases, two or three heads are better than one. It's out of print but if you like famous quotes, get this game."
1,"Outdated, no earth-shattering information",This is a COMPLETE waste of money. I didn't learn anything from this book that wasn't common sense! It is VERY outdated and apparently is just for people who have been under a rock since WDW was erected. SAVE your money and do NOT buy this book! Buy the WDW Passporter.
1,There is a sucker born every minute!,If you buy this book...you'll fullfill the above colloquialism. This work had potential...but the material is often repeated from one chapter to the next and discrepancies do occur. It leaves a person feeling cheated. Some information is just plain wrong. Mr. Losik also refuses to list any sources for his information or identify facts from speculation. The plagarism of website sources is blatantly apparant.I recommend you hang on to your hard earned cash.
3,"Great set, not enough variety.","Bjork is my favorite female artist, and this box set was a great addition to my collection of her fantastic musical prowess. Unfortunately, for 43.99 I'd expect a little bit more variety. Sure you get two CD's and a video, but what you are actually getting is 7 remixes of one song - All is full of love. Not worth the money if you ask me, but if you are a hardcore fan of Bjork and you got the extra flow in your pocket, then you should buy it."
1,Failed to deliver,"A few months ago I used Ghost 10 to back up my C drive to both a second internal hard drive and to a 200 gig external Seagate drive. Well I needed to recover that C drive this week and neither of my backups were able to restore the C drive to operating condition.It also made Outlook unstable, forcing me to reboot frequently."
1,Dangerous...,"Ghost is at best a tricky software backup and recovery package. I have been unimpresed with previous versions, and from the look of v.10, things are not getting better...proceed with caution!"
1,Unreliable. File Errors. No Repair or Salvage Possible,"I periodically backed up C: drive (approx 40GB) onto a separate 160GB drive making complete backups (not incremental). After needing to reinstall XP on a clean drive, 3 of the four backups were not readable. The readable backup has a moderate number of seemingly random subdirectories that are empty when they should have contained files. Thus, a casual check of a backup would have you think it is really complete when it may not be.Previous editions seem to have had a command line option to explore files (.gho)that are ""corrupted"" but it does not work on Ghost 10 files (.2vi). Symantec's help for error EA39070A was not helpful."
3,Ghost Recovery will work for some and not work for others,"Read the reviews here or on any other Ghost forum and you see the problems so I will not reiterate here. I will say that if you think of buying Ghost 10 or any other back up software, Stop and think before you make that purchase. You can download a trail for FREE. Do that. Run a back up and try to recover and make sure the Recovery is compatible with your hardware. Retest after any hardware change. If you feel comfortable with your product and you like the way it works, then go ahead and buy it. Here are what are argumentatively the top 3 Disk backup software (at least as far as toptenreviews.com writes) and all 3 have a FREE trials. They are Acronis True Image, Paragon Drive Back (which I settled on) and Norton Ghost which needs an external environment that it is compatible with to recover."
1,Buy Ghost 10 at your own Risk,"I had Ghost 9, and once set up, had no problems with it... however, after having my computer hard drive crash and have to be repaced 3 times in the past month - I was told Ghost 9 was no longer supported by Symantec and had to upgrade to 10. It has been a fiasco. None of the tech support depeartment seem to have a clue how to set up this program, or even its basic functions. The only way I'm getting any support is calling Symantec in the States, asking for escalation team to call me, they then set up a time for a ""2nd level"" agent to call me back, a process that takes about a week each time. It appears that the vast majority of Symantec agents have no knowledge of this program, and I dont even know if its set up correctly on my new hard drive, and wont for about a week - ridiculous and should not have been released if they dont know how to use it."
1,Does it work? I'll never know!,"I bought Ghost 10, registered and activated it, used it for two backups. I tried to restore a backup today and got a message saying my trial period had ended. WHAAAAT (!?). I can't get through to the activation server: the program hangs until it's rebooted.Can't get through to the on-line support line after 4 hours of waiting, my problem is not addressed on FAQ. Without service support, I might as well cut my losses and send the Ghost back to the spirit world after a decent cremation! The general consensus that this program is seriously flawed is backed up by my experience."
2,Disk image-Partition Magic worked much better than this!,I preferred the software when it was Disk image-partition magic as that software would allow you to resize the partition and this does not. For example my 80 gig drive was replaced with a 300 gig. I used automatic restore and when it was finished I still had a 80 gig drive with the rest as free space. Attempted manual restore and still no way to resize athough there is a option for it...perhaps it's just buggy but the older versions (before symantec bought it and broke it) worked just fine.
4,Chanson de Petula Clark!,"Les Plus Grands Succès De Petula Clark is one of those rare albums that contain so many hidden treasures. ""Chariot"", ""Don't Cry For Me Argentina"", ""This Is My Song"" and more! Petula Clark's voice makes any song, in any language, simply gorgeous! This album will delight any Petula Clark fan with this collection...Tres' magnifique!!!"
5,The BEST breath product EVER!,"There is no better product on the market to eliminate bad breath! Too bad the mouthwash companies tried to put them out of business a decade ago when they were ""Breath-a-Sure"",because they knew they would put them out of business! Take two of these at night,and no morning breath!! This stuff is great!"
3,Does not work for me!,I'm not sure but I have tried different ones in the past and they worked great but unfortunately this brand is not working for me! :(
3,sword of the Stars,4x strategy games are my favorite genre and after reading the reviews of the game I was really looking forward to playing a game that sounded like a cross between Master of Orion and Homeworld. Sadly the 3-D map was so cumbersome to use I couldn't figure out where my ships were. The tech tree was almost as mystifying and it was totally unclear what the advantage of one advance was to another. The space battles were similarly disappointing. After playing for a couple of hours I got so bored I went back to GALCIV II. This is a genre that has really been neglected by the game industry. Hopefully Space Empires V will succeed were this game failed.
1,"American ""Do-Gooder"" Lands In Peruvian Prison","Rhoda Berenson's relentless defense of a daughter with revolutionary aspirations seems to confirm all of the unfavorable stereotypes about upper-middle income liberal New Yorkers. From my reading of this book, the Berensons are stuck---flying to Peru; lobbying for Lori's parole; and defending her odd approach to human rights---an approach that landed her in prison."
1,"Lori was naive at best, most likely guilty","If you look at Lori's past, and the evidence, it is clear that the Peruvian government did its job and that she was guilty. Peruvian politics are not for dabbling, and for all her mother's wailing, she might at least look at reality a bit more clearly. I felt there was an incredible bias in the writing and unfair portrayal of Peru. At least Peruvian justice put away that Dutch serial killer, vn der Sloot, whereas the US did not.I love Peru, even with all its troubles, but this book is just an example of what can happen when an arrogant American goes to fight injustice in a faraway land and not at home. I think Camille Paglia's theories about protected middle class girls shocked when life gets rough outside of their environment apply here. Maybe someone can mail Lori some Camille Paglia."
5,Thorough survey,"This book provides a thorough survey of the Bucks County ""Impressionist"" painters. Plenty of good quality visuals, excellent as a resource. Particularly of interest to people in the Bucks Co, PA area."
5,Improve Listening Skills and Have Fun!!!,"My sons, age 3 and 4, played this today for the first time. Both of them had a ball!!! All of us were laughing and having fun, and I was thrilled that it was requiring them to use their listening skills, follow directions, and share (it emphasizes that more than one player can stand on a spot). It also introduced my three year old to the fact that he can't win every time. I really liked the fact that any of us could win each time. It's really lots of fun for the entire family, and with no little pieces to lose or a small board to crowd around. I highly recommend it to everyone with a preschooler!"
2,We Just Didn't Love It,"I bought this for my 4 year old. We played once, he had an okay time, and then we were done with it and he didn't seem very interested in playing again. I returned it.There's not much of a challenge in it, and we can dance around and be silly without the electronic prompt."
4,We play every Friday night,"We have ""game"" night every Friday and my 4 year old daughter ALWAYS picks Hullabaloo! She is sooo in love with this game we have to negotiate how many times we will play before bedtime."
3,Contains some Crude Wisdom,"The Rules for Getting Laid is OK for beginnners, with some roughand crude truths in it like ""women aren't here to make your life easier"" and ""listen to what she is saying"". But it is basicallya very traditional book which takes the usual Macho approach. For a sleeker, funnier more sophisticated and completely outrageous approach to getting laid read, Sam Priest's ""Shagging for America"" which also has hilarious illustrations and great lines. For example ""What's the definition of eternity?""Answer: ""The time between your coming and her going"""
1,Worst book I've ever read,"This is by far the worst book I've ever read and I wouldn't waste my money on it if I could go back in time.It has nothing of any value to the reader and every section,sections because it wouldn't be fair to call them chapters,seem to re-hash something from a previous section in an attempt to fill up this pamphlet. Two teenagers that have never got any a** could have written a better book...at least it probably would have been funny!"
5,The Bible for Getting Laid!,"Better than any other book out there on dating, The Rules For Getting Laid got to the bottom line instantly and stayed there on how to get the women I wanted into bed. The authors are incredibly funny, practical, and amazingly perceptive, though the introduction has some really bad typos in it. The book really made me see the difference between seducing a woman and just having a casual conversation with her. I feel I know the difference now. After reading this book I am no longer stopped by rejection. By the way, where can I meet the chick on the cover of the book (Yow!) Women of the world look out, I am a rules man!"
1,Eats Batteries for Lunch,"Cute little gizmo with alot of features for the price. Takes decent pictures. Doubles a an SD card reader. But, and this is the big problem with this little camera, it goes throught batteries at an incredible pace. A high quality alkaline will last no more that 8 hours. When the battery dies, you will loose all your pictures. Except if you use an SD card. If you buy this little toy, be prepared to use lots of batteries, and an SD card to be sure not to loose your photos."
5,A Note from the author,"The net-distributor has not yet gotten details on this book up for the reader to view. This is an ""essence outline"" of Richard Hooker's ""Of the Laws of Ecclesiastical Polity"" that distills down each subsection of all eight books into their core ideas. Think of it as a ""Cliff's Notes"" of the Laws. Until they get details posted here you can read excepts and get more information at www.viamediapress.com Being the author I am rather partial to the book, you will have to rate it for yourself!"
2,Noir No-No,"Late in his life, Errol Flynn added to his impressive catalog of professional disgraces by appearing (drunk) in a stage production of ""Jane Eyre."" He must have forgotten his utter failure in this dud film noir, in which he plays an ambiguous Mr. Rochester-type character menacing (or is it trying to protect...?) good old Barbara Stanwyck. When the family secret is finally revealed at the end, you'll shake your head in disbelief -- if you're still awake."
5,Great sprinkler timer,"This is our third sprinkler timer. I was able to install it within a few minutes and it was very easy to set up. Works just fine, I'm very happy with it."
5,Same as described,I am from Romania so I really wanted to read the second part of Maitreyi from Mircea Eliade.I was pleased by the book and loved it.Thank you.
3,good moisturiser but not great smell,"As an organic moisturizer that I can apply without having to worry when the babies use me as a teether this works well. I'm not at all keen on the smell though. Other people say it smells good to them, so maybe it's just me."
4,10 Insider Secrets...,"This book is especially great for those people who aren't sure what their life purpose is, or what type of career they would really be happy in. Teenagers, young adults and adults of all ages would find this book to be very helpful in deciding what career path they should take for complete happiness. It's a real ""how to"" book, and the author's methods work. The material covered in this book is easy, fast reading and fun."
2,Who cares??,"This album reminds me of a supposed quote from Maria Callas. Callas while listening to a radio broadcast of another soprano turned to her companion and said. ""What a lovely voice! But who cares???"" Ms Fleming sings everything with great beauty and lush tone but no character! Not once did I feel she was involved in any of these womens situations. Butterfly and Manon may as well be the same woman. If you want to hear how some of this music can really sound buy almost any album by Rentata Scotto,Maria Callas or Renata Tebaldi."
3,nice pictures,book is overall good don't forget it was made a while back and still some of these tanks are amazing just to look at. wonder how those tanks are doing now.
3,Big Aquarium Dream Systems Only,A nice book with some good information and lots of pictures. But only of real use if you are putting together a big system. Like over 200 gallons!
4,The Killer's Cousin,"This was an excellent book! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it. I liked how they didn't tell you the whole background of the story before David moves in to his aunt and uncle's house. The ending probably could have been better, but it was sufficient. I would recommend this book to most people who like to read and anyone who needs a semithriller!"
4,A Real Mystery,"The Killer's Cousin by Nancy Werlin is a well-written book. It's about a seventeen year old named David Yaffe who had accidentally killed his girlfriend and then had to move in with his aunt and uncle. In his attic apartment, he kept seeing ghostly shadows and heard a strange humming at night. He also had to deal with his eleven year old cousin, Lily's hostile behavior. As he learned more about Lily, he started to figure out a secret that's been kept hidden for 4 years. I really liked The Killer's Cousin because I thought it was great mystery book, which I really like. Also, because the author did a really good job describing the characters and the setting. I think this book is great for anyone who loves mysteries as much as I do."
5,The Killer's Cousin,"I loved the mystery of David's life which was slowly revealed and the unfolding of Lily's story which eventually enterwine with a common thread. They both learn a powerful life lesson in the end. A compelling read. Excellent mystery, no illustrations, and will recommend it to 7th through the 12th grades, as well as teachers and parents."
3,Interesting,"""The Killer's Cousin"" is a good book. It has a lot of suspenful parts to it for example when you are trying to figure out who killed who. It also keeps you interested by making you think about you a really reading. The book also makes you wonder a lot too. You would never guess that a seventeen year old kid could do the things that he has done but try never hard to make up for them. I think people should read this book if they like a little suspence."
4,"not bad at all for a game made in 2002, pretty fun","ok i just got this game yesterday, great speed in delivery and everything, kudos there. ok so ive been playing and i must say its actually a pretty fun game, it is very basic and im sure it doesn't hold a candle next to the UFC Undisputed, but all in all ive been having fun with it. im a huge royce gracie fan and am glad he is on the game. the fighters all handle pretty much the same so its easy to catch on and hone your skills. Nogueira is the best on the game in my opinion. im happy with it and recommend it to anyone. my only gripe is that there isnt more of a story mode, but survival mode is fun either way"
3,Too Small,Very well made and I'd love it if it was bigger. But you can barely cut butter on this and why bother when you can take out something bigger.6 1/2 is just not as big as you think when you're thinking on-line.It is very good as a trivet! (Though really there are less $$$ trivets to be found)
2,Olympia Deluxe 35mm Camera,"Wow, what a misleading picture of a product. In the ad the camera looks great, like it would be a fantastic buy. When I received the camera, the first thing I noticed was that it is made entirely out of plastic. The picture looks much better than the product. I was very disappointed as I was getting it to trade my daughter for a older Canon model. I would not recommend this product to anyone. I do not have the pictures back yet to see what kind of quality the camera makes."
1,"Totally emo, cheesy tear-jerker",Looks like a quick effort to get something published and cash in on the hysteria surrounding the bombing. The author search for material to fill the books 276 page span but only comes up empty and trite. Pseudo-theological observations just add to the overall cheesiness. Skip the books and wait for it to come on A&E or something.
2,Captain Hook Costume,"What is pictured looks wonderful. What I received, does not in anyway compare to the picture. The hat is a piece of cloth with a sticker, the coat looks much more substantial than what is received and the cloth around the neck was just a small strip of cloth. I was disappointed in the product only because the expectation by the photo did not match up with the product. I felt cheated."
5,Cheap and Works.,"small siren, easy install, relatively loud for it's size, easy to customize. What more can you want? Aim it towards a bulkhead to pick up a bit of gain and it's good to go."
2,Now that I understand it better...,"I retract my previous negative review. The more I learn about the cult of Dionysus, the more I realize just how well-researched and how well-crafted this novel is. I still say it might be a little boring if you don't know what's really going on--but think about Dionysus, think about Ariadne and her myth, learn everything you can. and then look at it again and see the pieces begin to fall into place."
4,"Hated it, but for all the right reasons","I am a definite fan of Elizabeth Hand's work, and have been since Winterlong came out. I love her writing style and the rich use of imagery. You will be awed by her ability to paint a landscape in words and by her keen observations about people. Some of her standard themes pop up again, like the use of the festival to signal that reality is about to get bent out of shape.My main problem as I read this book was that the heroes are all basically drugged-out losers that don't do anything. They feel there's no way out, they're depressed, and they kind of shamble around and waste time. Lots of weird stuff happens to our heroine, but she doesn't really do anything about it or even wonder about it much.At some point you suddenly have an ""Aha!"" and realize that Hand wrote it that way on purpose. When I finished it, I couldn't stop thinking about it. The book is ultimately very powerful thanks to the extremely effective ending."
3,or 2.75 ratin...some japvapor...,pretty good orig. show. the vapor scenes are the best but could have had a lil more of this and more action for this practically unknown film not the same as h-man-tcm finally aired recently apx 4/09 which was tad better with more & better action and monsta scenes.
2,Class assignment,I had to watch this movie for a college class. I would never have watched it on my own. This was a scary and sad movie
2,Just OK,"Sometimes gadgets and features are a good thing. Sometimes they compromise the quality of a product. This is the case with the Sharp 3 CD to MD recorder. The driver for the CD side of the equipment whirs(?) and makes other noises. Granted, this doesn't affect the recording, it just feels lower quality. The other features are fine, but just overall OK. I have actually returned the Sharp unit and bought a CD to MD with just one CD bay."
1,Do not buy this TV!,"I bought this Zenith TV 3 years ago and it lasted 1 year. It broke just as the warrenty expired. I went to get it fixed and OF COURSE they don't ""make parts for Zenith anymore"". Just my luck. The TV only works maybe 4 hours out of thw week. When I try putting the TV on it makes a clicking noise and then if I'm lucky after about 5 minutes of ""clicking"" it might go on. Once it's on it only last for maybe 1 hour. DO NOT BUY A ZENITH. They are garbage!!"
2,"Not as fun as I thought, but an okay game","This game is fun, but yet the only reason I bought it was because it was VERY cheap for Black Friday sale online. It's really TOO easy to tip it over, and as an adult I couldn't even play 2 turns before it would tip over so easily. My 7 year old son got so frustrated with being unable to get any turns in as it would tip over, he doesn't even want to play it anymore. Too challenging for even an adult."
4,I used to love this game as a kid,This game was so much fun. I used to play it all the time. I can't believe they brought it back. It's a great game of skill. You can play with a group or challenge yourself.
4,I used to love this game,I used to play this game as a kid. I loved it. It's the type of game you can play with others or just chanlleng yourself. A whole lot of fun for everyone.
1,Art Quilts: A Celebration of 400 Contemporary Designs,"I am really disappointed in this book; it is not what I expected. It has a lot of pictures, as promised but, I do not like hardly any of the designs (only 1 in the whole book that I think is rather nice). I also assumed that some instructions on techniques would be included--they're not."
4,Knitting Pillows,"Finally! Knitting books that you can take with you! Although I have only been knitting for a short time, I was able to use this book to make a gift for my mother. The directions are clear, the pictures are great. A must-have for the travelling knitter."
5,MAGICAL FAIRYTALE,tHIS IS THE MOST MAGICAL STORY I HAVE EVER READ. IT IS TRULY A MAGICAL FAIRYTALE. I COULD READ IT AGAIN AND AGAIN! THIS BOOK TRULY MAKES ONE BELIEVE IN MAGIC. MACKENZIE IS EVERY WOMAN'S DREAM COME TRUE. THE MYSTERY SURROUNDING THE KINSTAIR CHRONICLES AND THE QUESTIONS REVOLVING AROUND HIS TIME TRAVEL ARE GREAT. I RECOMMEND THIS TO ANYONE WANTING TO DREAM.
2,REDUNDANT,The reader from Austin is right on the money. The dialogue between the two central characters reads like two five-year-olds bickering. This lasts most of the way through the book. When the plot finally starts moving the book is at an end. A good 100 page cut could have saved lots of time. Can you say editor?
3,"Pleasant, but not one of her best","First of all, let me say that I am definitely a Debra Dier fan, but this is not one of her best books. It's a pleasant diversion, and I did enjoy it, although I must agree with some of the other reviewers that the repeated scenes of ""I am not a witch"" and ""I know who I am"" did get irritating. If you want to see how truly ""magical"" Debra Dier can be, read _Beyond Forever_...it's a great book and a fresh twist on the time-travel plotline."
1,Junk Junk Junk Junk,"Had unit for 2.5 years, used DVD rarely but used the surround through the TV a lot. Now after being on for 5 minutes it makes a high pitched whine or whistle that hurts your ears. I have traced the source to the FM antenna: when I remove it the noise gets worse. I have owned exactly 3 sony products and all failed catastophically. A potable cd player that skipped when sitting still, a car CD player that would not eject CD's for months and now this. I bought this unit from Best Buy because someone exchanged it and Best Buy was nearly giving it away (it was only 3 days old). I have never rated products but Sony has disappointed me so much that I am going to buy a different manufacturers home audio system rather than fix this piece of garbage."
4,Bought mine used... but It works great!,"I bought this system a year ago piece by piece. It only cost me $120 total. I got the receiver used, the sub used, and satellites new. I know it was a risky move to do so especially that it was used and the reviews about this system have not been good.But the audi and video is great. The system is great. I haven't had any substantial problems with it. My only complaint is that inserting and ejecting discs take some time to get used to and its kinda slow. But I usually have my top 4 CDs/DVDs in there and and keep the 5th slot ready for quick access.So yeah, for the amount of money that I bought it for, it's definitely a steal. But most of you probably also bought it retail. Well, the reason I got it is because I saw it in my brother-in-law's condo and I loved it. He said that he was satisfied with it and upto now he still hasn't had problems with it.I hope this helps."
1,BAD,"I am giving up on this system.The CD changer takes too long to change discs, and the system crashed in one unit in 4 weeks- I exchanged it and it broke again after 2 weeks.Luckily I paid for an extended warranty that allows immediate exchange as well as replacement for dissatisfaction (Local retailer)."
4,LOL!!!,"This game is a lot of fun , its pretty funny too. This toy is alao really durable because i have dropped it and dropped things on it and its never broke . GREAT TOY ! BUY IT!"
3,fear the suit,"this is really a kids movie,however it was quite entertaining,and funny in spots.i love sci-fi.,so with all said and done it's pretty good,compaired to a lot i've seen."
1,Not as pictured,"I chose the Personality Traits Beerbands that are shown to say things like ""polluted"", ""sex addict"", etc. I did not receive those, I received a set with completely different sayings. FALSE ADVERTISING! I'm extremely unhappy."
1,Junk,"This is an absolute piece of junk. It shows the temperature of the window, not the outside air. I could never recommend this product to anyone."
1,YOU GET WHAT YOU PAY FOR,"The major problem with this device is its placement location in proximity to the indoors, e.g., on a window. The indoor temp seems to affect the outdoor temp reading by anywhere from 3 to 7 degrees. Would be better if it had a wire probe that extended further from the device. Returned item. Don't waste your money."
2,can't read it at night,"This thermometer requires backlighting to read the LCD displayed numbers, which makes it completely useless at night. If you ever want to know the temperature in the dark (alot of the time in winter in the north!), don't get this thermometer!"
1,"CD PLAYBACK IS EXCELLENT, THE VIDEO IS TERRIBLE. FREEZES.","I THOUGHT THE PRODUCT WAS DAMAGED EN ROUTE. I PUT IN A CLAIM TO AMAZON.COM AND TO ZENITH TOO. WHY SHOULD I PAY FOR A PRODUCT THAT DOESN'T WORK? NOW I'M SURE THE PRODUCT IS ALSO NOT A GOOD PRODUCT RIGHT OUT OF THE FACTORY. I FEEL LIKE A YUGO CUSTOMER, I TRUSTED THE NAME ZENITH, AND STILL WOULD, IF I CAN GET A WORKING MODEL FOR THE RETURN OF THIS ONE."
3,You get what you pay for,"Contrary to previous reviews, this player (mine was produced in June 99) will play the movie ""The Matrix,"" although I have experienced mild skipping in scenes with high action. Bottom line is you most always get what you pay for. I give it a generous three stars based on it's price."
2,Never mind...,"After singing the praises of this player I ran into problemswith my next couple pf DVDs. The Abyss continually skipped chapterseven though it played straight through in slow mode. I also had problems with other discs. I could not get tech support since they were closed. Rather than wait-and based on other reviews here, I returned the unit and bought the Philips. I tested ALL my DVDs on it and it works flawlessly. I think that if Zenith fixes a few things they could have a fine DVD player."
2,Plodding,"Jane Austen could write a comedy of manners in which there is not a lot of action, because her characterizations were brilliant, and she had an dry wit which she applied to her social observations. Many contemporary Regency writers do not have this ability, and I am sad to say, this book is no exception to that.Not very much happens in this book. The heroine is more idiot than madcap, and the situations into which she throws herself are ludicrous.In short, this book is boring and tedious, and the reader will find herself yawning in no time at all."
3,Looks are decieving...,"I had a 300 and wore it out,lol..I seen the 400 and thought that it looked nice with 4 rollers and pretty lights.Well, it is not anywere near as good as the 300..The 400 is very slow and if you apply any pressure it will practically stall.. It could use a stronger motor..Overall,I am disappointed with it.."
1,Very short life,"Received it today, about two hours ago, followed all of the directions and sat down. It went from the lower back up to the top of the back with the Shiatsu message. All is well? Nope! From this point on, it stays at the top position and will not go back down. The rollers do nothing, only the Shiatsu works but in one place only.Returning tomorrow...I'm done with Homedics as I have had nothing but unsatisfactory results with them, although this is the first time I have actually had a Homedic product malfunction."
1,disappointing customer service,"I ordered this with 2 day shipping from Amazon - it arrived promptly, but without the power adaptor! Homedics customer service says it will take 2-4 weeks for delivery. ""There is no way for us to ship small items faster."""
2,not exactly a home spa,"I originally tried this unit at a friends home and my first impression was very positive. Owning one however calls attention to its size and discomfort to sit in when not in operation. Yet putting away and taking out requires fairly large storage. If I had to do it again, I would not buy this unit. I like the big hand units better, assuming you have a partner."
4,Massager Seat,"Best purchase I made so far this year. I enjoy this item. And I always get great customer service from Amazon, and my purchases arrives in a timely manner.Thank You,Gordon DeLima"
2,disappointing,"Sometimes when they try to makea product better, it turns outworse. This is a good case in point.We have a 300 model, got this forour son. He said ""send it backand get me what you have"" so backit went, and we got him the 300.The 300 model DIGS into your back,what a massage. This one seemsweak by comparison. The gimmickyblue lights inside do nothingto improve its performance, whichwe felt was anemic compared to the300 model."
2,made for midgets,"I never thought to check the size. After I unpackaged and set up the back massage I realized that at 6 ft 2 inches, I don't fit in it. The top rollers reached my shoulder blades. When I folded the seat back behind the massage unit and slid the massage unit one foot higher, it could massage my upper back and neck but the I fould that my average width shoulders did not fit between the top ""wings"" of the unit. This product should be marketed to children and very small adults only."
1,Stopped working after 2 uses and poor customers support from company,"I brought this gift for my mother-in-law for her birthday. After using it just two times the whole system stopped working completely. I contacted the seller FireFly Buys and they said it was past the 30 day return policy. I do not recommend buying this - it's expendsive, unreliable and the company has a rediculious return policy."
2,Doublecheck Wix Filter's website before you buy...,This filter does NOT fit the Mazda 6 2009 V6 as the Amazon tool indicates. Received it and discovered its about a half inch too wide. Make sure you check the Wix Filters website for compatibility rather than trusting the automatic part finder.
4,Valuable Guide,"This is an excellent reference to the major zoos in the United States. The author has done an outstanding job of providing a lot of detail about the major exhibits at the different institutions.I have visited a large number of the institutions reviewed, and believe that his descriptions are fairly accurate and up to date, although some exhibits will need to be updated as these zoos continue to improve their facilities."
3,Smaller than Inspected,"This beautiful pin was smaller than I expected. I should have checked the size before I order it. ""My fault""."
1,Awful,"I am going to have to disagree with many of the posts that say that this is the worst basketball game ever....it is the worst VIDEO GAME EVER! First off, Run-and-Gun is a pretty important strategy to have at least ONCE in a while. This game sports the worst passing scheme ever created. Next comes the computer's 2% FG% but rebounds every time and dunks it right back in on triple coverage. Next comes the worst part ever...if you are lucky enough to execute a nice layup, unless you are the 1999 Duke Blue Devils, good luck getting it to fall. Most likely however, you will not be this lucky and your guy will put up a stupid jumper 2 feet from the basket and of course miss. I guess it is normal for a guard with a 98 rating to shoot 10% from 3 feet out. I have not played March Madness, but it is physically impossible to be any worse than this game. If only you could give negative stars."
4,The Rhythm is an appropriate title for this dope ass cd,"The albums content is definetely Freestyle with a splash of Latin House.The lyrics are all so dreamy and the bass line hums, I make sure to spin the vinyl for ""The Rhythm"" at all my gigs it's a sure crowd mover. Lovin the inside pic of Alexis looking back! It's albums like this and others like M:G, Angelina, Buffy, Lil Suzy, Sonique and Cynthia that keep freestyle alive!"
1,so regret bought this product,"I am furious about this product. The heating wire is a such a bad design even it works as to keep warmer longer or cook faster, but the problem is:first, it damage your oven top. I didn't realized until it damaged all my four porcelain coated wire grated of my 2000$ whirpol range.Second, it's extramely hot and dangerous, you don't want handle this kind of danger at home, it burns my gloves, burns my table, and sometimes if you are not careful enough, it burns your everything....and be careful, the customer service of this company-- Sunpentown is aweful...."
5,BRILLANT,I BEGAN READING THIS BOOK TWO DAYS AGO. SO FAR I HAVE HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH HALF OF IT. THIS BOOK IS VERY INTERESTING AND KEEPS YOUR WANTING TO KNOW MORE. IT FEEDS THE HUNGER FOR KNOWLEDGE THAT AT LEAST I CRAVE. SO IF YOUR INTO HISTORY AND YOU WANT SOMETHING TO FEED YOUR BRAIN THIS BOOK IS A MUST.THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME.
3,Fair,"Although I found this book romantic, as all Ms. Edwards books, I thought the characters were a bit too hard-edged and judgmental. I, in particular, found it difficult to believe that Becky could suddenly fall in love with Blazing Eagle after being held captive. Although she wasn't mistreated necessarily by him, she was forced to stay outside the entire time. I also found it hard to forgive Blazing Eagle for forcing Becky out later in the book when his memories of his family's massacre came to him, and he saw Becky's blond hair as too much a reminder of the woman in his nightmares. Even when he realized his mistake and took her back, I felt he didn't apologize enough and Becky was a bit too forgiving. But the romance was satisfying, if you are willing to overlook these points!"
1,the big bag,"Beautiful luggage, but too heavy and won't fit under a bed and takes up too much room. It is over 50 pounds before I am finished packing."
4,very entertaining,"An excellent plot, not too original but consistent, good characterization and art are the main assets of this yaoi.They are so good in fact, that they overbalance the usual flaws of this genre: the annoying censorship of sexual details, the usual taste for rape of not so unwilling boys, the very confusing sequence of dialogues.And please, will someone make at least the best yaoi creators (they are not many) understand that this rigid division of sexual roles in bed is disturbing?They even overbalance the fact that less than half of the book is dedicated to the main story. The other stories are not bad, the one about the two fathers is quite nice, but the booklet is much too short for the price I paid for it."
5,Unlimited Access,"If this were a Republican administration and just one third of this were true, the president would be kicked out of office within the week. It's a very powerful book. If you voted for Clinton this book will make you question the decision that you made"
2,Highly questionable reading with an agenda,"Gary Aldrich definately had an agenda to portray the Clinton Whitehouse in a bad light. Sure some of this dirty lanudry may be true but how much are lies backed by a GOP conspiracy? Aldrich failed to get good, believable reviews from major critics, interestingly enough, a right wing publisher printed this book. What does that tell you? It was facinating reading, however.Some of his claims have already been proven to be false. Futermore, not all FBI agents are repectable. Look at J. Edgar Hoover and other former agents who sit in jail right now as you read this.I would take Gary Aldrich with a grain of salt."
2,A politically incorrect review,"A well written book but the author shows his true colors with his biased attitudes towards the Clintons, the Democratic Party. Is the author a Republican? If you hate political correctness, you'll think this review is helpful."
5,Turned My Stomach,"The utter lack of respect the Clinton's have for this country our military and each other never cease to amaze me. The incompetance during the Clinton 'administration' is thoroughly laid out in this book written by a top FBI agent who was there.There are a lot of typos in this book which can get irritating. I give them a pass because of the importance of the overall content. The truth is not in the typos as people like Al Franken would have you believe.If you want more stomach turning facts about these two clowns, try Robert ""Buzz"" Patterson's book, 'Dereliction of Duty'. Patterson was Bill Clinton's top military aide. He was at the former presidents side at all times when he was on duty."
4,It does the job,"This machine was fairly easy to set up. I like it when the instructions are clear, and these are. When I read the other reviews, I noticed that some people pointed out that it's necessary to not speak too close to the microphone when recording the greeting -- I heeded that warning, and everything has worked just fine. I really like the feature of the machine holding the last 50 phone numbers of callers -- my old answering machine only held one. My only quibble is that the LED display is just a bit small, and I have to hold it just so in order to read it. That problem may be solved by getting a new pair of glasses. :)"
2,Not up to usual Panasonic quality,"I've had a couple of Panasonic answering machines over the last 25 years, and they all seemed to be built of high-quality materials. But as soon as I unpacked this one I saw what appeared to be a big scratch mark across the LCD display panel cover. When I rubbed it with a soft cloth to see if it might be a grease mark instead, it only caused another mark along side it.My previous two Panasonic answering machines had a hard plastic cover over their displays - I don't know why they changed to soft plastic on this one.So I returned it for a refund."
1,Messy betta feeders,"This product is poor. The fish are colored and the impregnated material does not completely dissolve, leaving colored sandy material on the bottom of the tanks. The water in both bettta tanks became the color of the fish feeder. My fish were still alive after a week, so I'm hoping they didn't fast that entire time. I did, however, bulk them up before I left and fed them immediately after my arrival home."
4,It worked!,I was out for a 4 day trip and this product seems to have done its magic as my betta (the only fish in my fishbowl) was happily floating around when I got back.
1,Doesn't work!,"I saw the mixed reviews and had to give it a shot. Very disappointed!! I put the item it, it immediately sunk to the bottom and started to slightly dissolve or fizzle. That was it! After three days it still did not provide food. I had to keep feeding my beta during those days because it was quite obvious it was starving. After the third day i took it out and ran it under water and i never saw any fish particles of any kind. Have no idea what the fish was supposed to eat as there was nothing freeze dried inside of it. RIP OFF! I had the water ph and temperature perfect for this work. I would like to know from someone who used it with success what the process was like for them, as I still have the rest of them left."
1,Does nothing but dirty,"I got these at my local Petco store, figured I could use them when I went home for spring break. My mistake, these things are pieces of junk. I placed one in my bettas tank and it sunk watched and it did not appear to release any food. Plus it has plugged up two filter cartridges in just a matter of days. I do not recommend these."
1,TEST BEFORE LEAVING,I left the beta block in my tank for a little over a day at around 74 degrees and nothing. A few fizzes at the beginning but it didn't dissolve at all into the water. it just sat on the bottom getting soggy. Finally I took it out and still hard as a rock. looks like my fish will be traveling with me!
4,Daughter loved it as a bassinet,My daughter slept in this for the first three weeks of her life while she slept in our room. She slept soundly. It is small enough to put beside our bed or at the foot of the bed. We have not used it as a play pen as my daughter cannot sit up yet.
3,Faster than what?,"Well, the movie was a little too far fetched for me. I'm a DJ fan, but this was just a little over the top. No, it was A LOT over the top. What started out as a good story soon took a turn south when all he did was more of the same for being in prison. What happened to the cops? Were they on a break all the time when DJ was ransaking the area? OMG! Entertaining yes, and the story had so much promise, it just didn't deliver in a good way."
3,Passable thriller,"Faster has some great moments and a very decent premise. Unfortunately it's also fairly poorly executed in places. It's also very predictable and cliched and some of the acting is pretty wooden with the exception of Billy Bob Thornton (although he has a terrible haircut in this film). The basics of the plot are that Dwayne Johnson's character is out for revenge and it's established very early on that he's very determined. There is however a kind of pointless subplot about a hitman who is on Dwayne's tail. All of the scenes featuring the hitman and his girlfriend serve only to pad out the film and slow down the pace. The twist at the end can be seen a mile off, but if you're looking for a no brainer action movie then this isn't too bad a way to spend 90 minutes of your time."
4,Panasonic for me.,"I originally bought a Sony cordless phone, but had all sorts of problems with it. The battery wouldn't hold a charge; the sound would cut in and out; static would drown out any sound for five seconds, even if I was standing right next to the base! On recommendation of a friend, I bought this Panasonic, and love it. Maybe its not 900 megahertz digital whatever, but the quality is there. This quality is evident when you use the phone, and it easily outperforms a lot of the newer ""high-tech"" phones that friends of mine have in both sound and range. I have never had any complaints or problems with this phone."
2,Ma? What are they giving me???,"Back in days one heard hype of how Shellac were turning down the offers of superstardom and mega ka-jillions from all of the ""major"" labels, thumbing their noses at ""the man"". Instead, they chose to keep their day jobs and make the music that they wanted to at their own pace, rather than on some schedule.Well, after waiting for quite some time, the fans are given this. Needless to say, it's good thing they didn't quit their day jobs, as they have proven to be substantially more lucrative than any music that they are currently putting out as a band (if that's what you call The Genuine Article, or anything with Weston singing on it).It's almost as if Shellac is SOOoooo uber-cool, that they're thumbing their noses at their fans now, knowing that we'll still buy it. Perhaps, the only redeeming attribute of this album is the packaging/artwork.I'll give it two stars for the first two to three songs. Flush the rest down....tell the sewage treatment plant to BE PREPARED!!!"
3,Dull sheen,"I'm afraid to say that this is their worst release yet. They seem tired; just farting around the studio, producing what amounts to several times as what we would term ""practice"". Nevertheless, there are some nifty tracks here, first being the opener, ""The End Of Radio"", a longish song where Steve becomes the last radio announcer after some sort of holocaust occurs. I like ""Be Prepared"" but have no idea what it is about, and it really isn't and has never been important to know. But as I said, as great as this trio is, I would hope for more."
4,Kinda soft boys,"Like everyone else I waited for what seemed like a decade for this cd. When I finally got it, I was a little disappointed. I guess I expected more from Steve and Co. Genuine Lulabelle, Kittypants? What the? Even Spoke is so so. I guess 6 out of 9 isnt bad, but I didnt expect the soft crap from my heroes. Come on I got the Lomo logo on my arm (I know Shellac) but this album was just ok, nothing too hard here. Getting old, not into it whole heartedly, whats the deal? I dont think its just me, something happened (died) here. Maybe theyll rock out again in 7 years!"
5,The greatest book on psychic powers since Uri Geller!,"Dr. Louis Turi, DDS, is the greatest psychic since Nostradamus. Born in the French provincial countryside of Provence France, Dr. Turi has a unique insight into future events sure to affect us in the future. His ""Windows"" are mind-boggling feats of paranormal ability, whereby he accurately predicts events within a 24-hour window. And Dr. Turi is PRECISE - when he says an earthquake will happen somewhere in the world in any given month, you can bank on it. This book is a perfect reference for those fearful of Y2K problems. It also makes a splendid gift. Buy your copy pronto! Bravo, Dr. Turi, bravo."
5,Great Connect-the-Dots,"I love that the numbers go higher than most connect-the-dots books. The paper in the workbook is very thick and each page gives a short sentence describing the different dinosaurs on the page. Plus, there's a pronunciation guide at the back of the book that is very helpful!"
5,good fine-motor exercises...,great book for youngsters. gives them the opportunity to practice their fine motor skills which will help ready them for school.
3,Brief Review of Washington Naval Conference,"This book is a collection of ten papers on the Washington Naval Limitation Conference in the early 1920&#65533;s. The emphasis of each paper is on the position of each of the participants of the conference. Since the book is rather short &#65533; 319 pages &#65533; the papers are not very detailed. These papers primarily stress the political and strategic aspects as they affected each participant. There is little on the technical effects although these were rather important (see A. D. Baker III&#65533;s &#65533;Battlefleets and Diplomacy&#65533; at www.warships1.com/W-INRO/INRO_Battlefleet.htm). The coverage of the U. S. and British positions offers little that is new, but the material on those of France and Italy is not so well known. There is a tendency to interpret the arms control negotiations from the viewpoint of Cold War arms control negotiations which leads to rather anachronistic interpretations."
4,ALARM DOES THE JOB,"I use this alarm for a high water alarm I have setup in my basement pump room. When the water gets close to an overflow point in the rain barrel that I have set up, the alarm goes off and I know to start pumping outside. Its good."
4,one of the few companion planting books,"This is, surprisingly, one of the few books out there about companion planting. A wise, observant gardener's insights are valuable to anyone wishing to know more about plants."
2,I don't believe the book lives up to its title,"I was assigned to read this several years ago as part of a Japanese culture class. Although the title looks promising, I did not find very much useful information in the book. Any of the insight into Japanese culture or language given in the book could was easily surpassed by the course's other reading requirements, including ""Learning to Bow"" and ""The Accidental Office Lady,"" which were also far more entertaining.I feel that the sub-title sums up the author's frequently arrogant tone of writing, inferring that this book will help one ""Walk and Talk Like a Native Speaker."" After reading the book I felt that that title was nothing more than a marketing strategy to entice students and others seeking an understanding of Japan into buying the book.Unless this book is assigned as a reading requirement, I do not recommend getting it, especially for those considering the book because of its proud title."
5,The only way to learn...,"I have tried looking at tabs and sheet music (I am a 30+ year trained pianist and musicologist) and I have never been able to get from what's on the page to the sound of these old blues. This DVD works - you can sit there and watch Ernie's fingers as he takes apart the songs, you can rewind and look at each lick as much as you want, and get all the questions that the tab doesn't answer answered. (What chord are you fretting there? Which finger takes that note? How do you pick that?)Hawkins is very calm and mellow on the DVD. The songs are all the ones you want to play. Only one caveat: Hawkins plays the songs authentically, on a 12-string tuned down 4 half-steps (low bass note = C), so you can't play along with him on a regular 6-string guitar, unless you get all tuned-down and floppy. But that's OK - I just watch a section about 25 times, and then try to do it myself.Highly recommended."
2,Yes ripped off.,"I think you could make a drinking game of attempting to match scenes in this movie to Alien and Aliens. Fronm the grainy footage of a derelict spacecraft and people asking ""what is that?"" to the chest burster scene, to the person peering through a ceiling tiles, to the marine that goes crazy, to the large gun attached to the waist, the list goes on and on. It's almost worth watching to see how many ""matches"" you can make."
3,commercial song,"Actually, the song on the commercial IS ""The Slam"" by Tobymac. I just saw the commercial and came to see if it was on the soundtrack. Unfortuneately its not. But i just thought i'd let you know, that it is Tobymac not POD even though it kinda sounds like POD, the part in the commercial says...""this is the SLAM this is the one..."" so there ya go"
2,ok,"This is an interesting video soundtrack and has been listened to a lot by me, Dave, Brinda's husband. I got tired of it and threw it away."
4,Azaria scores a big one,"To me, the best part of this soundtrack is the orchestral cues by Azaria. This is the most exciting scoring I have heard since John Barry went into retirement.Without question, Azaria should score the next Bond film."
5,Fantastic educational tool,"This book is great at giving general knowledge that you can use on any diesel engine. I have done quite a bit of tinkering with gasoline engines and needed to learn specifics about diesels so that I could work on my own tractor and bull dozer. I'd already bought the manual on the dozer. It had lots of specific information about my dozer but overall was very difficult to understand. I couldn't even orient myself to the drawings.When I got done with this book I felt like I could look at any diesel engine, large or small, and understand almost everything about it. It is very well written with great pictures and drawings.This is one of the best book investments I have ever made."
5,Illustrated Tarot Spreads : 78 New Layouts for Personal Disc,"This is an excellent book for anyone. If you are just starting out or an accomplished reader, this is a great resource to have on hand. It can be used with any Tarot deck. The book covers many different issues and has more spreads than any book I have seen. A must for anyone serious about Tarot."
3,"""Were"" to start learning about Lycanthropy","Only days ago I purchased the Creatures Fantastic VHS video ""Werewolf"". The first thing I noticed upon viewing this tape was the wonderful reenacted scenes of werewolf legend, lore and fact and colorful video illustrating that brought the subject to life though unfortunetly for only 30 mins. running time. I would say for any werewolf fan this video is a must especially for the price Amazon.com provides, or for those who simply would like an overview glimpse of the topic of werewolves...be warned though the video is of basic detail on it's discussions and tends to be sided towards only focusing on werewolves as creatures of evil and not exploring all apspects of their myth to include some good aspects to their lore. In conclusion to my review though in one purchaser's opinion this video isn't a waste, nor a blockbuster and does hold the interest well in video content. Don't take my word for it though check it out if your interested!"
3,"Vol.19: Jack Masters, Coley, Gang Bangers, etc.","More of the same, for better or worse! Highlights this Volume: ""Hot Shot Seamen"" by ""Joe"", whose art is more ""pin-up"" than ""sequential storytelling"" in nature; ""Jack Masters Private Dick: Love"" by Joven, in which the P.I. (P.D.?) is hired by a jealous wife, only to find it's not other women her hubby is cheating on her with; ""The 23rd Century Lovers"" by Farraday continues the ""Cryogenics"" story from Vol.15-- as usual, the story far outshines the amateurish art; ""Coley: Riverboat Boy"" by John Blackburn, in which the blonde voodoo boy loses at cards-- AND loves it; ""Little Red Riding Crop"" by Kurt Erichsen-- more fun, humorous work; ""Gang Bangers"" by Sean-- in which a lost biker runs into a wild bike gang; and 12 more cartoons by Gerald Donelan."
3,decent sounds,"Good latin jazz from a mainstay. My favorite CD is still ""Street Sounds"", but this is a good progression."
3,Good value but not compact enough for travelling,"For the price, it's a really good value and works really well.You need to plug in a separate cable w/ power plug to the charger, which is a hassle if you travel a lot."
2,Maybe it's just me.....,"I have been working with this energy for over a year now, and I was REALLY disappointed in this book. I am not sure the other reviewers and I even READ the same book, to be honest, but the cover's the same.... The book seems to serve as an advertisement for his rather pricey attunement package. He discusses NOTHING about the origin of Seichim, and can't even decide whether to spell it Seichim or Seichem. (It varies from chapter to chapter). So, no origins, no discussion except a disdainful wave about the well accepted symbols of Seichim, and his invocations really only float if part of you is still tied to the Judeo Christian tradition--he invokes God the Father repeatedly. The end of the book consists of a variety of testimonials and newspaper articles, fluff pieces all. A VERY disappointing read, unless you're a fan of Benny Hinn style faith healing."
5,Beautiful!,"I bought this tee shirt, and the Dragon Head for my sons. I ordered Extra large. they are both six feet and they were a little big on them, but they loved them. Its an amazing picture, very detailed."
3,ten new songs,"Back in the eighties , when Leonard Cohen's reputation had fallen into partial eclipse, a Columbia Records executive told him: ''we know you're great, Leonard. We just don't know if you're any good'' The same might be said of this new album. This quote is from today's Globe and Mail (review by Robert Everett-Green).I partially agree with him. Maybe after 9 years of silence from Mr Cohen and after songs like ''Everybody knows'' one's expectations get very high.The lyrics are 9.5 out of 10. The music is 7/10. Previous records instrumentation was more elaborate , had more of a jazzy subtle sound. The music needs some work.''In my secret life'' appeals to me the most because it is reminiscent of some of his previous songs like ''Democracy is coming''.But definitely the songs are full of typical cynical Cohen renunciation and observation..the types of songs that Leonard Cohen fans like me lap up with delight."
1,Can't believe this is Cohen,"I bought this last November and never thought of writing until today when I signed onto the site...While some people obviously really love this CD, I want to say that my initial reaction was real surprise. I couldn't believe it was Cohen. My children, who love Cohen, had the same reaction. Each of the ten new songs sounds the same to me and it's not a fun kind of same. I should have previewed more of the tracks. Hopefully he will return to his normal self because his music is usually wonderful."
4,Fantastic Meditation on Life,"Compared to Cohen's last outing, ""The Future"", this new album ""Ten New Songs"" is a stripped-down sound, with simple orchestration and soft sounds. The lyrics he sings are as still as deep and thought-provoking as ever. Dark and light in perfect balance, Cohen takes us by the hand and leads down the backroads of his life, and into the crossroads of ours. It is very apt that this album is released in October, the beginning of Fall, Winter is just around the corner, and this will be the soundtrack for my Fall/Winter 2001."
5,Nice story,Nice story for kids at christmas. Suitable for 3 years and over. My 18 month old didnt get it but she is crazy about the bear in the big blue house
5,Hurrah for Poodle Mom!,"Thanks for expressing what many people want to say....How could a 40th Anniversary outdated VHS tape be issued for BILLY BUDD? I'm sure a multitude of movie goers are waiting for the DVD version, which is LONG OVERDUE as older movies have been released already. It is unbelieveable that whoever is responsible for holding this film from the public is doing a disservice to the cast and crew of this quality movie. Anyone know who is holding ""the rights"" to this film?"
5,perfect,One of the most brilliant adaptations of all time. It will move you in ways that few movies ever will. An unforgettable conflict between innocence and evil that will challenge you intellectually as well as spiritually.
5,Second time around,"We had one of these previously and it lasted for years. When it finally died, we realized how dependent we'd become. We looked at the new models but have a problem with the dorky characters that tell one how to dress for the weather. We live in Minnesota and we wouldn't be living if we couldn't figure this out for ourselves. So we purchaed this one again, due to the indoor/outdoor temperature ranges and humidity, barometric pressures graph, and even the moon phases. It's very accurate and doesn't rquire more than the occasional battery change. For the price, it's a great deal."
4,"Entertaining, novel read","I liked this book. I read it years ago, and recently reread it. I thought it was an enjoyable read. It is 200 pages long, and goes pretty fast, and it had novel ideas. The aliens have come to earth looking for a yellow eyed human, and they find one. The story sort of goes on a roller coaster from there."
4,Characters worth getting to know.,"The Patterned Flute is the first in a trilogy of novels featuring clever, funny, fiddle-player Kate Halton and her love interest, the ne'er-do-well but sexy photographer, Liz Sharpe. Well-written, sharply observed, and just general good fun. Not as smooth or as carefully plotted as the two novels which follow it, but well worth the price of admission."
4,CUTE,very cute! Hard to wear though but this ring is only for occasions. I wouldn't ear it on the daily basis
5,She's Not Real!!!,"For anyone stumbling upon this book by accident, I feel it's my duty to point out that Sarah Binks is a fictional character. This mock biography is satire, and pretty good satire at that--for example, Binks' untimely death occurs when she bites a horse thermometer in half and succumbs to mercury poisoning. The horse thermometer was awarded to her as a prize for one of her spectacularly bad poems. The entire book is a parody of rural life in Canada."
3,Good rocker-not padded enough for newborns,"This is a great rocker for older babies, but their is not enought padding on the for a newborn. I had to put a thick blanket on top so my son was comfortable, but then it's hard to strap them in."
4,Great!,"This product is wonderful because it grows with your child. It rocks and is able to stay still. It has colorful toys that play music. The only thing that I was disappointed about was that it only rocks, it doesn't bounce like a bouncer."
3,Loved this product!,"I loved this product! My baby loved it! I really enjoyed it until 3 months of using it, the vibration mode quit on in. Bummer."
2,Started out great...,"For the first month or so, my daughter was comfortable in the seat, now at 2 1/2 months old and weighing 12lbs., the chair is so unsteady that it is ready to tip over when she kicks her feet and gets excited. It is put together correctly but we need to reinforce it every time we put her in it to make sure she is not injured. The monkey toy plays it's little song for about 3 seconds.... not long enough to hold the attention of a newborn, needs improving. Also, the third toy that hangs from the toy bar is a hard plastic ball, again, not safe while baby is in rocking mode as it has the potential to knock baby in the head, especially when the baby is learning to lean forward and hold there head up. Definitely needs improving all around. I don't see this making it until she is 2yrs. old as the manufacturer says."
5,Life Saver,I received a swing for a baby shower gift which I couldn't use because it didn't give enough support for a newborn. When I saw this item I didn't hesitate to buy it and have not regreted my decision. My two month old son loves this seat. He enjoys the vibrations feature and the hanging toys. We started off in the reclining position with the kickstand down (not pictured) and have just progressed to the rocking position (pictured). It's light weight so I find it easy to move with me from room to room. Can't live without it!
4,A Favorite!,"We received this rocker as a gift from a friend who buys this for all his new parent friends because everyone who he has purchsed it for raves about it. Count myhusband and I as fans.Our little girl (now 10 weeks) has been using this since she was about 4 weeks old. She likes to just hang out with us in the family room while seated in her rocker and she ""mellows out"" with the vibrations. We also seat her in it and put her in the middle of the table while we have dinner. If she happens to fall asleep in the rocker, which is often, the recline feature is great, just flip the ""kick stand"" and you have a mini bassinett.We think this product is great."
3,Love the Monkey! Too big to transport around,"My daughter, now 4 months old, doesn't seem to like being in the rocker anymore. She has this and a swing. We liked this for the colorful patterns, toybar (removable as well as the toys) and the vibrating feature. It's also pretty inexpensive compared to the others we looked at.The main problems I have with this is that I thought it was foldable. It was probably my fault when I believed I saw the word foldable somewhere. The only thing that folds on this is the kickstand. It is way too bulky to take with us to grandma's or anywhere for that matter. The batteries died quickly (2 months - with not much usage). The bar comes off too easily.The monkey was the best part of the toy. We've clipped it onto the Sassy links so it could be used with the Boppy 5-in-1 and her car seat or the swing. The monkey plays a little tune that is cute and she loves it."
4,LOVE IT,"My son Loves his rocker, and so do I. We got this as a gift before my son was born. It reclines back which is nice for when he is sleeping and relaxing and when he is awake while i clean or do dishes he can sit by me and play with his animals.I highly recommend this for everyone and anyone expecting or looking."
4,Older version is better!!!,"I recently purchased the infant/toddler rocker after watching my 2 1/2 year old niece enjoy hers so much. I have only two complaints, the older version which my niece has is much better. The older style has the vibrating unit on the back of the rocker situated between the two legs. This version is right in front under the seat, which keeps the rocker leaning too far forward, and the vibration is really strong for an infant. I need to put the kick stand out in order to keep my son from leaning too far forward as he is still small, and does not have very good ""head"" control yet. Overall, I think we will be able to enjoy many years of use out of this rocker as the weight limit is up to 40 lbs. This rocker is of very nice quality, and the colors and pattern are great."
2,CAUTION - TIPS OVER,"The seat is very easy to put together and my son loves it. But it does tip over forward if he leans over to get a toy. It happened once and he was not hurt, just scared. So - if you get this and your child can even sort of sit up on his/her own, be sure you're right next to the seat while he/she is in it."
3,Kick and Play better,I bought this rocker because it had a higher weight capacity then the others. I have a very active 2 month old. She gets bored pretty quickly. This chair does nothing but vibrate. My mother purchased the Kick and Play bouncer and she likes it much better. She smiles at the lights and music.
2,Good for the first couple of months,"My daughter is now 3 1/2 months old and is bored with it. I bought it when she was about a month for a seat for her to sit up in but now she whines when I sit her in it and attach the bar. It's just not doing enough for her. I have the seat adjusted to the closest position for her to sit up in and she still is trying to lift up to sit up more. Also the toys are not great at all. The only one she'll look at or play with is the monkey because it plays a tune but a very short tune so you have to keep pulling it to hear the noise. It's also starting to rip at the seems I guess where I've been pulling it to hear the tune. If I had to do it all over again, I wouldn't purchase this infant seat."
5,rocks my daughter to sleep,"A very good rocker... My daughter is 3 month old and loves it she is very comfortable in the rocker. She loves it the best, when her favorite rocker is in the vibrating mode.She uses it for her afternoon naps.Finally ... we loved the rocked . A good choice made..."
1,Not very good for 7 month old,"I purchased this rocker hoping my son would enjoy sitting by himself in a chair. Thank goodness I was sitting with him because he leaned forward to grab his toes and the chair tipped over, luckily I was there to soften his fall. He also dislike the toy bar because the toys are right in his face and the hanging ball is hard and can hit his head. I do not recommend this chair to anyone with a child who can move."
4,Durable and portable chair,"I don't think of this as a toy. Our kids wouldn't stay long in the chair once past a few months old. But we did use it for feeding kids while traveling because it is very portable. At that age the baby can sit, play, sleep, and eat all in the same chair. The conversion to rocking is great and so our kids have continued to use it. We have a 1, 2, and 3 year old -- all of who have and do continue to use it. But two of them just wouldn't ""stand"" for sitting once they became mobile. A great investment though and durable enough to survive three easily!"
4,Great Fun,"This was one of my lifesavers with my baby. If I had to do chores, I'd turn music on and situate this little rocker where she was pretty much in front of me and I'd clip on toys that she prefered. I didn't care, or actually she didn't care for the toys it came with so I ended up clipping on the toys that she liked. My main complaint is that it is not padded, it gives no comfort or support. Other then that it is a great product and I would highly recommend this"
5,I'm SO happy with this new chair!!!,"The old one broke, WHILE baby was in it, slapping his head on the hardwood floor. So, my main concern for this new one was safety and STURDINESS! Well, I got it!! This thing is SOLID! It's held together with screws and steel pins. Gotta like that. It was easy to put together, and baby seems comfortable in it. The cover comes off easily, and you can access the battery easily too -- no need to take off the whole cover. The cover is held on with sturdy clips, so it's safe too. Baby can reach the toys, and they don't bump him on the head. The recline feature was nice too. It has buttons to raise and lower it, so it's secure. That reclined position would have been nice when he was smaller. I'm also really pleased that this one is rated for up to 40 pounds. He's only 4 months and already weighs over 19 pounds!!"
2,Barely works on a Mac,"I tried to use it with a Jaz and a Zip drive on a Mac. It barely works. Only good for small file transfers. Large file transfer (10-20MB) fail due to ""write errors"" across the SCSI bus. Works better with a PC but the manufactor is no longer supporting this item (so NO OS X support)"
4,Surprised by its sound quality,"Great sound quality. I have tried almost every ipod speaker/clock-radio available in the market this side of BOSE and this baby beats them hands-down in clarity, depth, richness and price. I just love pretty much everything about it especially the convenience of having a full function remote control. My only grouse is with its size, which is a little too big for the nightstand but since we didn't buy it for the nightstand, we are fine with it. The other issue is the build quality. A few days after the purchase, the onboard volume control started acting up. (only increases irrespective of which way you turn it) But since the remote has volume control i am not too bummed about it. Other than that, it is a sure winner. I don't know what that other guy is talking about when he says it hisses or whatever. He probably has a bad unit and should just get a replacement."
1,DID NOT WORK,"I have been using this cream for about a month now and I'm sorry to say that it did not do a thing for me. I bought it based on the great reviews, but unfortunately it did not work for me, and I so needed it to work. I started having hot flashes last year and I bought the ""New Phase"" supplement which worked great for a year, but this March my hot flashes intensified and they stoped working. I bought the cream with high hopes of finding some relief, oh well! I will try the Bio-Identical Hormones that I found online, they are more costly, but I'm desperate. Summer is just around the corner and I need HELP! It may work for some of you, but you won't know till you try, Good luck!"
2,Emerita Phytoestrogen did not work at all,I was desperately needing this product to work. After 3 weeks of habitually applying twice daily.....nothing. Not one of my symptoms were affected and I continued to suffer. Symptoms were terrible vaginal itching and burning and constant pain around that whole region. Not a chance of considering trying sex again (that's been off the agenda for over a year now...which is how long I've suffered with this). Don't waste your time or money....I'm off to my local doctor's office to get some professional help.
5,A versatile set of small bits.,"Unlike some of the other reviewers, I haven't had any problems with this set. The bits are small, which means they'll bend and ultimately break if you abuse them. They could be made less susceptible to bending, but that will also make them more brittle...there's a compromise between malleability and brittleness. Basically, though, there's no way to make a 3/64"" or 1/16"" flat-blade screwdriver, a T3 Torx, a 0.050"" hex bit or a #000 Philips bit very strong.The chuck and knurled sleeve are both made out of metal; the handle appears to be a fiber reinforced plastic. The yellow finger grip is a slightly softer material to improve your grip as you turn the screwdriver. The top 1/2 inch is free to rotate, allowing the screwdriver to rest against your palm while turning it with your fingers.Treat this like the precision set that it is and it will last a long time. Put too much force on the bits and you'll destroy them the first time they're used."
2,smooth jazz? I think not!,"I liken smooth jazz to ""syrup"" jazz. Too much of it makes you sick. Well, at least Peter White doesn't pretend he's playing jazz. What he has been playing for the past 3 albums is sickly sweet instrumental music, and it gets to you even if you are a fan (I have all his solo albums). There's nothing in his latest offering that will excite you if you clamour for some of his brilliant solos or compositions which you'll find on the Al Stewart albums or his first two solo albums. Still, as elevator music, his latest album is listenable unlike Larry Carlton's latest, Deep Into It which sounds uninsipred and mechanical.I hate this smooth jazz business; perhaps these guitar players should take a holiday and come back with a ""good"" guitar albuminstead of going through the motions to put out an album."
3,Gary Cooper is good in this,"I am not sure if this movie follows the story strictly, but I found Gary Cooper's performance to be the best of the lot. More and more, as I have seen him in old films, I have come to appreciate his acting ability. In this film his time onscreen was way to brief for me. I look forward to seeing Johnny Depp in the latest version of the story."
3,"Visually fascinating,but hopelessly incompetent","The movie lurches from stultifying dullness, to dizzying chaos.Many of the Hollywood legends featured provide little more than dubbed lines,being buried under bulky costumes.The final scene is worth waiting for, but goes by much too quickly to make up for slogging through what comes before it.The DVD image quality is only fair, images are fairly flat, and the audio is passable."
2,WRONG COUNTRY,"I am very disapointed. I purchased the dvd through Amazon and was never told that it was incompatible with my dvd player.Eventhough it was shipped in Canada, this dvd could only work in Europe.I was invited to return it to get my money back, but the return address is in the U.K. which means that it will cost me the same price as my purchase. NONSENSE.is there a return address in US.?"
5,Finally Out,"Finally....this long unavailable version has been officially released by Universal/MCA, and it does justify ""all good things come to those who wait."" I'm glad the Johnny Depp version motivated Universal to release a DVD on something they have owned for over 50 years. The original materials have always been well preserved and this DVD version, when digitally projected, looks like a 35mm print, complete with the NRA logo at the front. I have waited so long for the opportunity to see the 1933 version in this format....bravo to Universal for doing such a great job!"
5,The Long Wait Is Finally Over!,"This version has been on my list of ""must have DVD's"" for as long as there have been movies to purchase. I haven't even seen it on TV for decades and it used to be shown around Christmas or Easter every year while I was growing up. None of the remakes can compare to it. It truly is a classic."
3,essential epidemiology,This book was in much poorer condition than I expected. Bent pages and tons of highlighting and underlining. I don't mind a little bit of highlighting and underlining but this book had enough to cause distraction. Disappointing.
3,Its A Good Thing My Traking works!,I bought this box set about a year ago not knowing what these movies were about.When I popped them Into my VCR I had some traking problems. And the sound was weak. Anyways I got it working and enjoyed the movies.If you plan to buy these movies beware of pic touble and low sound.
3,Needs light,"Overall, the product is absolutely wonderful. It's a little smaller than I imagined it would be, but completely brand new with no defects. The only flaw is that you have to be either in a room with a lot of light or somewhat put the calculator underneath a lamp for it to work since it's solar powered. Nonetheless, its still a great product for the price."
4,Thrilled grandson,"My grandson was so excited - it was a birthday gift when he turned four. All he said when he saw it was WOW. And then WOW WOW. And a few more WOW's. He just sat down on it and dug up stones the rest of the party. And everyone took turns, including the older children. It was the hit of the party."
2,Not A Typical True Crime Book,"Although the book is very well written, it is an account of the author's life before, during and after the Dunblane tragedy, and his endless campaign to get the British firearms laws changed. There appears to have been very little research done into the life of the murderer and the what events happened in his life to make him commit such a despicable crime. Although I am sensitive to the author's feelings and indeed those of the parents of the other victims, I have preferred the book to be more about the murdere's life, not the authors. I regret to say that I failed to finish it and probably wont attempt to read it again."
5,Awesome product,"Being a motorcycle technician, I need tools that are going to work no matter what, this is essential for any small engine mechanic."
1,A big disappointment,"I agree with most of the reviewers here. No restoration, no directors cut equals big disappointment. Paramount is sitting on a gold mine with this franchise but it has been so badly mis-managed."
1,Paramount is just trying to make money,"Paramount knows that it can put out anything Star Trek on blu-ray and fans will buy it. They can be terrible copies and the fans will buy it. They could include no extras and the fans would buy it. And when Paramount comes out with a better version, they will buy that too. And with the special edition packaging and they'll buy that. It is useless to complain when you know there are too many who have plenty of dollars and no darn sense who will buy it no matter what the quality. We just have to be patient."
2,"Once you blu-ray, no going back.","I did not like the look of this set in dvd. It is true that once you see movies in blu-ray you will not want to go back to dvd. The view of these movies suck on my Sony 40"" LED... However, i have three of the movies in this set on blu-ray and they looked fantastic. I purchased it because i wanted The Original Motion Picture with two others and I didn't want to pay the $90 on BR so i went cheap and got the dvd... back they go. There is no enjoyment for me as i am so used to watching so many movies in blu-ray. I love blu-ray... better cough up the cash or wait for a sale. I would also appreciate it if Amazon would package our Star Trek movies with more care and respect. Every other movie or set i buy is always tightly plastic wrapped. What is it wit' that."
4,Awesome!,"A great edition of these movies! My only wish is that they had included the Director's Edition of Star Trek: The Motion Picture! But otherwise, incredible."
1,"sorry - i have to agree - no restoration, no sale","Pretty simple - Paramount is milking the series for all its worth, which right now is not all that much. Charging $ 100 for these movies is ridiculous, especially when they're not cleaned up / restored. Sorry Paramount, no sale here!"
5,picture quality great,"Got this for Christmas. Picture quality great, to go from VHS to blu-ray BIG difference. It's small compact in the skinning cases boxed in together. It's all 6 Star Trek Movies with lots of extras on each disk, including commentary. I don't own the DVDs so I don't know if it's all new stuff, but for me it is. The 7th disk (which claims to be new never before seen)is an interview hosted by Whooppie Goldberg with Picard, Riker, Kirk, and Spok (forgive my mis-spelling) I found part 1 a little boring with parts 2 and 3 more humorous.So for the advid fan you may already own all 6 movies, if you currently own the VHS I'd recommending up grading to this set on Blue-ray. If you have been holding out then this is the set to get. If you already have the DVDs then you might be fine (you aren't missing much with the 7th disk)."
2,Yet another vote to wait . . .,I plan on buying every single Star Trek movie on Blu-ray. But I will not do it twice. Consider this another vote to wait on the extended versions.
1,Where are the director's cuts?,"It's pretty simple really. I won't buy these until they issue the director's cuts on blu ray. It would be nice if they would do both in the same package. Release each movie seperately like they did the dvd versions a few years back, give us the same extras, that's fine, but give us the director's/Tv versions too in high def. That's all I ask."
2,"theatrical cuts ok, but video quality?","I'm fine with the fact that these are theatrical cuts. in fact, with the exception of ST 1, i think the theatrical cuts are better. (but they should have included both cuts wiht seamless branching)but what really gets me is the quality of the video on this. it really looks bad. go to www.avsforum.com and see the screen captures for yourself. it's certainly an improvement over the dvd, but it's still really bad for blu ray.i'll wait for the inevitable re-release...hopefully the jump in quality will be comparable to the jump from the original dvds to the 2-disc special editions."
1,Not again......,"This sucks, the movies I would give 5 stars, but come on, this is blu-ray it should be so much better, I would like to see a complete Blu-ray Collection of all 10 films, all fully restored, all with the original theatrical release, the extended cut, and the directors cut ext.......Blade Runner got it right, what an epic Blu-ray Collection. Something like that would be great.but for now, I am waiting........just waiting"
4,Finally up to 82 AUs!!,"Very excellent collection for blu ray compared to the SD DVD available now in both quality and price. There is very much debatable on its true HD picture for films except Star Trek II. Since I am but a few of fans of the first film, it was a joy to finally see a much cleaner version of it. To me the theatrical version is far superior and flows better than the directors cut. Another good thing is the first film does follow ""To seek out new life forms and new civilizations"" much more than the films to follow than being all out phasers/photon torpedo shootout with familiar Star Trek villains. It was to follow similar deep sci-fi films like 2001 and Solaris to name a few. In all a great purchase. Possibly Paramount can do better."
5,Star Trek Original Motion Picture Collection,"These movies are fantastic. I've already seen them, but I couldn't find them on DVD here (at stores near me) for a reasonable price. So I searched high and low and Amazon.com had exactly what I was looking for, with a WAY too reasonable price. Great packaging, great quality!If you are a Star Trek fan, and haven't seen these films I highly recommend not only the movies, but the original series seasons 1-3 as well. I'm only twenty-six, but the doors that Star Trek opened for the rest of Sci-Fi fanatics like me really is (excuse the sugar) heartfelt. I love these films, and I am quite sure that you will too!"
1,Those who don't remember the past are condemmed to repeat it,"When Will You Learn? Think back to the VHS and DVD releases of these movies and learn. Paramount is playing the same games. Wait for at least two more releases on Blu-Ray before you buy. Wait for the fully-restored, Special extended editions and you will be truly happy. Rent them or watch your upconverted Special extended editions until then."
3,Why regress?,I bought the DVD special editions a few years ago and LOVED the first movie. This blu ray set really lacks. The set i bought on DVD which is now discontinued is the best. I would wait a while for the special editions. I bought this and took it back.
1,"In the words of Clinton....i mean, come on!","uhhh... Only directors cuts? You've got to be kidding Paramount.. I agree with the other reviewers.. Paramount needs to do justice to these classic Trek movies and release the Theatrical & special editions, and clean up the picture & sound. Just like MGM did with the bond series using the lowry system. ( i think thats how its spelled) But alas they just want to milk this like it was on DVD. I've only owned the Vhs of the first 6 because by the time the standard(special edition) dvd's came out there was a lot of talk of HD. Now theyre giving us this crap? No thanks... i've seen the DVD special editions and those looked pretty bad, so theres no way im spending my dough on the $20 +(for each) paramount double dip scheme...."
2,Lost Data a Big Problem,"I have a complex return and lost all or some of the data twice during periond while I was entering data in the return. I am writing here after finding that Turbo Tax is heavily editing posts on their forum to minimize the problem. I have used this product for years with great success, but my confidence in its quality and accuracy are severely shaken this year."
5,TurboTax for Business2010,This product was purchased late because I heard that early editions were buggy. This edition was full of bugs and didn't get straightened out to well into the tax season.
1,This isn't even close.,"I have loved this fragrance for years, it's not even close to the right sent. It must be a knock off. Don't waste your money."
2,Wish I could have had a test drive!,"This looked like a more environmentally sound version of a Swiffer so I bought it. I don't like it because after you dust the floors you still need a broom and dustpan to clean up the pile of dust, not much of it sticks to the head. As for mopping, it is not very good because the velcro is so strong on the head that you have to struggle with the dirty wet mophead to rinse and replace. I really would not buy this again nor recommend it. The conventional broom, dustpan and scrubbing the floors works so much more efficiently."
1,Disappointment abounds,"I found this book to be one of the mostly poorly written sock-knitting books I have ever used. The patterns, on first glance, are quite varied and interesting. I started with the boot socks. While the pattern is technically very easy, it has one serious design flaw. Having some experience knitting socks, I thought it was odd that the pattern called for a 4"" heel flap, but then it required that the knitter bind off the stitches and sew a seam. Who wants a seam on the bottom of their heel. At that point I frogged and did it my way. I think any experienced knitter can manage to decipher mistakes in the patterns, but serious design flaws like I just described are inexcusable. If I could have given this book 0 stars, I would"
3,If only NASA enigineers could have built it....,"Great toy for the first hour. After taking it apart and putting it together multiple times, it doesn't stay together well. The accuracy of detail of all the seperate stages and the lunar lander and capsule is really cool, until you lose a piece. A stoarge device or some sort of clipping mechanism to store pieces once seperated would have been handy. The telescoping doors break very easy, and once broken are impossible to repair. A few engineering improvements would change this from a good toy to a great one. That being said my son loved this toy so much, I had to buy a second one when the first one broke beyond the ability to repair....so maybe they're not so dumb afterall....."
2,Not for small kids,"Bought for my four year old who is interested in rockets. Not enough action here - doesn't ""do"" anything really, and it is difficult to assemble and keep together - even for me. The top is flimsey and hard to keep together. Looks good on the shelf, but not really for handling."
3,Not for tall women!!!,"Really cute shower curtain--I loved the colors, and it looks great. But we put it up in our bathroom, and now we can't have anyone else use the bathroom when someone's taking a shower. Why? Because the clear area frames the chest area perfectly!!! I don't know why they decided to put it there--maybe it's meant for kids, or short people under 5'8&quot;...but beware!"
4,The easyest and shortest game ever,"This game was problably meant for four year olds becuase my friends three year old can get past the first level. I have to admit it was fun though. My recimendation, don't buy it, it's not worth it."
3,That's it ? That's all ?,I just got this game at the Toys-R-Us store and I gotta say it was fun but too easy. I finished the game in one day and the bosses are way too easy to beat. It only contains 7 levels and each has 6 stages. I expected it to be more. The original Kirby's dreamland for old Gameboy had more levels. In my opinion it's not worth buying. Rather just rent it at like blockbuster or something. They'd rent it to you for 5 days which is more than enough time to finish the entire game. I say this was the worst ... I had spent on a game. I just got it today and I am planning to return it tomorrow for something that is more amusing than that.
5,Kirby Nightmare in Dream Land,"I love That game. It's challenging at times but most of the time you're always advancing somehow. And sometims it isn't challenging enough. Especially when you face the nightmares, I think he should be much harder. But Meta Nightmare and Boss Endurance are incredible. Overall, it's the best Gameboy Advance game I've ever had."
4,Kirby is good,"Kirby, nightmare in dreamland would be the best gameboy advance game out there if it was only longer. If kirby games did not have lots of replay value after you beat them then this game would get a 1. I beat this game the day after i bought it. But there is lots of replay value after beating it, still there is nothing new anymore. If it was longer, like one of the Mario Advance games, then it would be a much better overall game, but it deserves a 4."
5,BEST game in the UNIVERSE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This is the best game I've ever played and ever will play!The graphics are almost as good Kirby 64: The Crystal Shards.You can still get all the powers and stuff,but you can't combine them.You can even tranform into a UFO with 4 attacks.Kirby to me is probably the best video game charcter to ever live.I'd definitelyrecomend it.KIRBY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,Love It!,"Another great Kirby game. Fairly simple gameplay, and cute charecters, especially Kirby! You can suck up your opponents and take on some of their appearence. Kirby has the ability to fly, by sucking in air to make himself float, and he also gains snorkeling gear when in water. Your ultimate goal is to beat the game, obviously. I was able to beat it, and had a lot of fun doing so! If you have enjoyed previous Kirby games, or like Mario, I would recommend this game to you!"
3,"Distant, inconsistent, and yet compelling stuff.","I am always surprised that I like Rick Shelley's stuff. It seems like typical military SF, but it often feels emptier. His characters go through all sorts of emotionally charged conflicts and battle stress, and yet it is hard to connect with them. The books seem oddly emotionally distant. And there is no arching narrative payoff. There is a simple, very linear, narrative of a SF military action. And the technology seems oddly inconsistent, with some things very advanced, and others not at all. And yet, with all that said, something about his ""just the facts mam"" style makes for very compelling reading. It is hard to put down. But when it is finished and I do put it down, I feel oddly empty. So how come I keep on buying his next book?"
5,love this product great for summer time,great love this thing with a passion its so bad ass to show people you can role your windows up and down i bought 2 of them for my impala i have the viper 5901 tied in to it its just the best thing it also makes all your windows in to one touch windows if there not all ready
3,Good choice!!!|,"Es un lente sencillo, para tus primeros pasos en la fotografia esta bien. el manejo de la luz es sencillo, nada del otro mundo."
4,good lens for the money,"To like: 1. good fast focus, 2. good sharpness, 3. no purple fringing, 4. good resolution. 5. very good IS (VR) for 2f/stops maybe even 3f/stops.Not to like: 1. plastic mount (come on!how much more to put a metal mount on it ?) 2. Plastic construction feels flimsy.Summary --- for the price (even full price) you cannot do better. A good lens, won't dissapoint regular users and even most hobbists."
4,price is right,"This item is good and meet the requirement but if i had more money, I would've not purchased it for my trip. Trying to save money but had to constantly change between 18-55mm and this lense to capture both zoom and wide angle shots. it would've been ideal to have a 18-200mm for quick shots instead of wasting time changing lenses."
3,Nikon 55-200mm Lens,"I really like the Nikon 55-200mm lens. It is a nice low cost option to be able to zoom in a little closer. However, I find I have to switch between the 18-55mm and the 55mm-200mm a lot. I would have rather saved the money and used it towards the purchase of a 18mm-200mm or 70mm - 300mm."
5,Fantastic all around,"Very happy with this lens, both optically and the VR.For the price, this is a no-brainer."
3,Fine but not very useful,"I bought this for a recent vacation to California and wanted a zoom to capture some close ups of the scenery and wildlife along the way. Used it with a D90 in tandem with the 18-105 Nikon provide out of the box. I bought from BestBuy and ended up returning it when I got back. Nothing wrong with the lens the quality is excellent for the price, I just did not find that useful. The 200mm max does not give that much zoom, and at 55 it's no use for regular pictures, so I found myself constantly swapping out lenses and then not really getting the zoom I wanted on the larger one. I'm going to wait instead to spend the extra on the 18-200 which while not giving me any more zoom will at least give me one lens that will serve most purposes. If you want cheaper long range zoom you may be better off with one of the available 70-300mm lenses"
2,Good lens but plastic mounting breaks easily,"This is a good lens as far as quality of pictures, size, weight, and ease of use. However, this is the second Nikkor lens of ours that broke at the mounting plate. The ribs that secure the lens to the body of the camera are made of plastic and they can easily be broken off. We have a Canon body with lenses that have metal ribs on the mounting plate. I wonder if other Nikon lenses have metal instead of plastic. This is a feature we will look for in future lens purchases."
4,Nikon VR 55-200 Zoom Lens,"Great lens so far. I haven't taken very many pictures with it, but it will be my main lens on my upcoming vacation trip.My main problem was in trying to find out which Nikon lenses would be compatible with my camera. It's very difficult to find that info on the internet. I'm sure I could have asked at the local camera store, but then I would have been pressured to buy the lens there. Buying through Amazon saved me about 40%."
3,Where's my filter?,"When I ordered the lens, it said I was to receive a free filter worth $10.I did not receive the filter."
3,kind of cheap,A little more plastic and cheap feeling than I expected. Pictures are nice and brilliant. I haven't noticed too much difference with the VR.
4,Noisy focus and VR,"The silent wave motor (SWM) focus system is not very silent; however, it achieves very sharp focus in good light. In dim light, the SWM struggles, and sometime does not achieve focus. Has anyone else noticed a noisy SWM in this lens, or is mine defective?The vibration reduction (VR) system is affective. It works very well in this lens; however, it is noisy. The noise resembles a clamping sound when the VR starts at the beginning of a shot. It produces a clunk when it releases after taking a shot. The image in the viewfinder also jerks at the end of the shot, which the instructions seem to indicate is normal. Has anyone else noticed this?"
5,Nikon VR Zoom,"This lens arrived just in time for a trip to New York City and I was happy with the results. My pictures are super crisp. I've used it at my grand-daughters softball games and got great results. I even used it from my deck to capture my grandkids in the backyard and the photos are great. I would have paid $100 more if I purchased this lens in my local area. I'm only an amateur, but I love the pictures this camera and lens take. I can't wait to use it next trip I take and would recommend this lens."
5,Love it!,It's a perfect step up from the standard Nikon D40x lens... I'm an amateur photographer and needed a good lens for taking portraits of my children.. I love it!
5,EXACTLY AS IT WAS DESCRIBED,I bought this lens and A Sigma lens. The glass in this lens is significantly more accurate.
5,Nikon 55-200mm VR Nikkor Zoom Lens,"In love with this lens! Takes excellent pictures and fits perfectly with my D3000. Lightweight, great zoom capabilities and enhances/keeps quality of pictures!"
1,Out of context,"I must admit that the author or compiler had written an excellent introduction for the book. However, perhaps Chesterton is not the Oscar Wilde, Bernard Shaw or even Winston Churchill type of person who frequently spoke intelligent words with a little scent of sarcasm, he is never a good choice for compiling a book of wise sayings. I am sorry to say that is by far the most boring book of its kind I had ever read. For those who want to know more about Chesterton and learn his wisdom in the right context, his autobiography is certainly a much better choice.p.s. I never expected that the book could be this very thin and small, and thus expensive, relatively speaking. (and even more expensive considering the quality of content)"
2,just don't feel cleansed,"I like the Hauschka creams but this cleanser left a residue on my skin, felt weird."
2,Just OK,"The remote is way too big to fit in one hand and the screen seems distorted. Maybe the color version is better, but this didnot look good at all. Programming is easy and this remote will do a lot, but one thing it didn't come with was the rf/ir extender and it has been discontinued for this remote, that's why I sent it back."
4,"Does the job pretty well, but how durable is it?","I was able to complete the firing-range games in Resident Evil 4 using the TMP without any problems. If that does not mean anything to you, basically this controller's analog stick is precise enough to make me happy. The rest of the controller buttons feel fine. There have been occasions where the character unexpectedly performed an attack, but that has been rare enough for me to still be unsure if it's a problem with the controller.A good buy."
3,What happens when you suck up a rock?,"Does anyone know what happens when a rock or stones get sucked up? I currently use a large shop vac to do our large patio and other areas, works great but a canister following you around kinda sucks."
5,Very handy to have when the leaves fall,Light enough that even my wife can use it. The unit is powerful enough to take care of large amounts of leafs.
3,Not as Good as Bob Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide.,"My wife and I read this book together, and despite the fact that many of the tips were the same as Bob Sehlinger's Unofficial Guide, it wasn't nearly as well-rounded or well-written. Sehlinger's book contains survey information from many Disney guests. It's information like ""Snow White's Scary Adventure"" was TOO scary for my three-year-old that this book did not seem to provide. Also, the hotel list named the major ones, but was not nearly as comprehensive as Sehlinger's."
2,"Good, but hard to trust","The author obviously loves the work he is doing, however he seems to have had very little first hand experience with the sources he uses. IOW, he quotes what others have said about the myths of given cultures rather than doing the research and actually reading these himself.Further, the book is muddle by typos and just plain bad information. This abounds for the material dealing with the ancient world, but seems to abate as one moves closer to the present.In summary, his theories are interesting, his methodolgy is intriguing, his actual descriptions of monsters are sometimes completely off. Read it with care."
2,"Wow, this is pretty bad...","I have never really been a JD fan, but I decided to give him another chance when I got this CD. And I still understand why I didn't like him from the beginning. His flow is too commercial for my liking and his verses are focused on materialistic things. One up side to the album, however is the beats. They are some really good beats, but too bad they are wasted on this trashy album.JD should stay away from rapping and stick to producing. There are only two really good songs on the album, Welcome To Atlanta & Hate Blood. And neither of these songs are good because of Dupri.There are some really good people featured on the album, and that makes the CD twice as dissappointing. JD - you need to improve your rapping or just give up altogether."
1,THIS IS A RIPOFF! DO NOT BUY!,"This is the biggest waste of money that I have ever send. They don't even send you a book. All you get is a few updated utilities, and a stinking technet cd. Who cares about the technet CD. I'll be sending mine back"
3,Newline Best Value Digital Bathroom Glass Scale,good but hard to understand how it woks still im not sure:) but it is acceptable. i like it price is good qualty is ok so three stars
1,Have to turn the scale on/off to get accurate weight,"Worked great the first time I tried it, but after a week it kept telling me I was 8lbs rather than the 143 that I am! Can't use it on a uneven floor surface, and only works with bare feet. Not recommended for someone that wants to keep a scale for a long time, this thing is going to bust in less than a year!"
4,Newline Digital Scale,"I give this 4 stars since other reviewers have placed doubt in my head that the readings could be inaccurate and be a few pounds off. I've read that weight fluctuates due to several factors, thus the inconsistent numbers. Mine varies by a pound or two at the most. However, I will have to try different scales to see how 'off' this one is. Aesthetically, it's clean, sleek and blends well with our bathroom. Definitely user-friendly and great value."
1,this scale never worked,"THIS SCALE NEVER WORKED. I COMPLAINED TO THE COMPANY AND ASKED FOR MY MONEY BACK. I ALSO COMPLAINED TO AMAZON AND ASKED FOR A CREDIT. AMAZON NEVER REPLIED. NEVER BUY THIS PRODUCT, AND DO NOT SHOP FROM AMAZON. ALTHOUGH I WAS A VERY GOOD AND FREQUENT CUSTOMER, I INTEND TO NEVER SHOP WITH AMAZON AGAIN."
5,Wonderful summer week-end read,"Weary of torturous plots that didn't make sense that I've been suffering through because they were ""highly recommended"" by people with ""reputations"", I reached for and started reading ""Put a Lid On It"" by Donald Westlake who wrote the dark ""The Ax"" and ""The Hook"". Every word of this comic caper was a joy including the dedication. I won't give you the plot (it's readily available). But let me tell you no plot summary can tell you the subtle ironic messages about our presidential election process I found in this crime caper. The ending is funny and touching. Don't miss this."
2,Too easy for a teen gamer...,"But perfect for the inexperienced gamer, or a little brother or sister. There are puzzles and bosses that are super easy. I rented it, but i wouldn't buy it. Rent it and see for yourself...not too challenging."
2,Wario stinks Mario rules,Don't get this game. I played it and it's terrible. The Mario games are much better. Get a Mario game instead.
4,GameCube...,"...This game is like Super Mario Sunshine truly, with the mini-levels, and the difficulty level. Also, you collect alot of things, making the game longer, but not much as its only 5 levels. I think if your a fan of platformers or mario games, you will like it. It's nothing amazing, but it is fun, and worth a rent at least. However, when compared to Super Mario Sunshine, this game has better graphics, but less innovation and much like the Wariolandf series. I give Wario World a 8/10, for being a good game, but nothing out of this world."
5,Awesome!!!!!!!!,This game is awesome! It's fun and easy! You get to kick and slam things around! Best game on the Gamecube! Buy it!
2,What a boring game.I think its stupid.,Man oh man this game is fun for about 5 minutes and after that it gets really really old.Dont get me wrong I love easy games.You know ones like Luigis Mansion and Sonic Adventure but man this game is just the same thing over and over.The only reason why I kept playing it was because something cool might happened.Guess what it didnt.The only reason I gave this game 1 star instead of 2 was because hardcore Wario fans might like it.Other than that it sucks.
4,Great pictures,My son did a project for his school and just used the pictures in this book. Mostly about King and Emporer penquins.
5,Belkin iPhone case,"I love this case for my iPhone. I don't like a permanently wrapped case as I like the feel of the phone.This case is really soft and protects the phone in my purse and once it's broken in, the phone is easy to slide in and out from the bottom.This is my second case like this, I lost my first one.Great price from this buyer and super fast shipping too."
3,Doesn't want to stay clipped on a belt,This case has a tendency to come off of my belt when I am trying to remove the phone from it. I have also dropped my phone several times while retrieving from this case. When pushing the phone up from the bottom the phone will be sticking out of the case a little bit and you can grab it and pull it out the rest of the way. It has a pretty good grip on the phone and has caused me to lose my grip and drop it.
2,Mine came apart,"After only two months or so of use, mine has come apart at the bottom. The mesh screen has come apart from the case itself. It's a shame, because I really like this case, but I'd advise against it."
2,Well-constructed modern oriental. Just not for me.,"Based on the reviews and the notes, I really thought I would like this one. I don't.There is something a bit irritating to me - cardamon? Also, it's a bit too rich in white florals, which I am very sensitive to in large doses.I can see how many would like this - it's a well-constructed modern oriental. Just not for me."
5,I DID NOT WANT TO PUT THE BOOK AND WISH I HAD THE SECOND BOO,"I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED HER BOOKS AND I DON'T KNOW BECAUSE THIS LIKE A MINISERIES, I COULD NOT WAIT TO GET THE NEXT BOOK TO KEEP ON READING. I HAVE NOT READ THE SECORD BOOK BUT I'M FIXING TO START READING IT TODAY. SO FAR IT IS A GREAT READING."
5,Hymns for Peace-Live at Montreux,Showcases Blue-rays quality and image not to mention the fantastic performance of Carlos Santana. Highly recommended.
4,Classic porn...,My interest in porn is limited to four classics from yesteryear. This is one of them. Its just plain classic.
1,Poorly made ripoff of another product,"While ""The Royal Road to Card Magic"" is a classic book that belongs in the library of anyone wanting to learn card effects, this DVD set is a poorly made attempt to cash in on both the book and another publisher's careful and far more professional effort to produce a video version of the book. Skip this version completely and look for the 5 DVD set by R. Paul Wilson."
2,Get the other one,I received this set as a gift and was somewhat disappointed. I returned it and got the 5-DVD set by R. Paul Wilson which I am finding more useful.
5,"Simpsons Make ""Jeopardy"" More Fun","Simpson's ""Jeopardy"" is unexpectedly fun, built on clever rule making, andoffers a good pace to the game. Highly recommended, especially for thoseof us who really like the quirky, mustard-colored family from Springfield."
2,Not worth the cost,"I had hoped that for the price that this item would do more than it actually does. My 5 yr old likes it, but it doesn't keep his interest. Definitely should not be priced this high."
4,Patti Austin is GREAT!,"I really enjoyed this CD, however, some of her songs that I think are really great don't appear on the CD, such as 'Change Your Attitude', 'Starstruck', and 'Hot in the Flames of Love'. When I first heard 'It's Gonna Be Special' I thought it was Chaka Khan, another one of my favorite girls. I would recommend this CD to all Patti Austin fans."
4,Pretty good indeed.,"I also was happy to see a book like this on the market. Im not a big fan of Llewyllyn publications finding most of their stuff kinda fluffy, but this book seemed to be about something so I bought it. Its nice to see a book about Michael out of the strictly christian context. This book contains wisdom about Michael which can be utalized by most anyone in any faith. Saint Micael is viewed as a powerfull Amparo, a protector in Curanderisimo and Latino Folk religion. Bringing this powerfull Santo to more people is a blessing. Check it out, its worth the cover price which I have to say is quite reasonable."
5,Tommy Rocks,"I got this CD when it frist came out and it is still rocken in my car. This CD was amazing and a little bit of a surprize considering Tommy Lee is the lead man in this band but he actually delivers some good vocals and with all the help he got from his supporting cast they made a winner here folks. If you like hard rock with some rap thrown in get this CD, it dose not dissapoint."
1,damn woman,"this cd sucks men if this is old school hip-hop than me granny loves hard rock. (and she doesn't) This is by far the poorest cd I ever heard in me intire life. I won't spill any more words now.respect,crappie"
5,A Thought-provoking Film,"This is a thinking person's movie. The main character, Nick, must figure out how to pass the tests that will determine how he will spend eternity. But before he can do that, he needs to discover what the tests are, using clues provided in songs by his rock idol. The viewer, too, must figure out what the tests are, and what Nick must do to pass them. Matthew Jure is excellent as Rex, the rock star, and Carey Peters is great as Beth. I enjoyed it and found myself thinking and talking about it long after it was over."
2,make one for 1.99 $,"I bought few of them, but now I just make them: Hide a key from Walgreens, wrap two wires around the key, close the box...done. Check the diagram to see what it is for real, then...you will agree with me. Have fun !!"
3,did not need it after all,Ordered because everything said I would need it for an 07 entourage... but I didn't so it works well as a paper weight but for what it is worth.. I think the product will work great if I ever need it
2,P.O.S,"The second worse item I have ever purchased from Amazon, this item arrived late and also broken (which isn't really amazons fault). I didn't return this item because I didn't care enough...I was simply disappointed that the company didn't care enough about its customers to pack and ship it properly."
4,only regret is made in china,"Otherwise it's a good product, am doing a little research on things now before I commit to buying them. I have a dream, of countries supporting themselves before other countries."
3,Very coarse grit,This stone is very coarse for any knife. It is probably good for sharpening garden tools. It is cheap and disposable. Rated 3 stars as it is a good value.
4,Why the moon is in the sky!,"A short children's book based on a folk tale of the Ashanti tribe of Ghana about the tickster Spider who is rescued by his sons and why the moon is in the sky. Children will enjoy hearing this story and even acting out its parts. The artwork is very appealling. The book was a 1973 Caldecott Honor book (i.e., a runner-up to the Medal winner) for best illustration in a book for children."
3,Not a total loss for San Diego.,"True, the Tigers mauled the Padres after the N.L. champs evened the score in Game 2. True, eventual Cy Young winner Jack Morris was ""untouchable."" True, veteran clutch slugger Kirk Gibson put his stamp of approval on the W.S. trophy. But all was not a washout for some San Diego fans - I mean baseball fans, not Padre fans. What the heck am I talking about? You nostalgia fans should realize that Alan Trammel (series MVP) was an alumni of Kearney High School in San Diego. [Go Komets.] He currently resides in the San Diego Athletic Hall of Fame."
2,A waste of time and money.,"I wanted to prepare for the French SAT II subject test, and I purchased this book because most of Barron's test prep books are excellent. But I had several problems with this book. First, there is no scaled score conversion table in the book. Also, the practice tests were not at all like the actual SATII in length or difficulty. The real SATII I took was much more difficult, and although it too had 85 questions, the test took me almost twice as long to complete.A good alternative to this book is the one put out by the College Board, which includes real, recently administered, SAT II tests. The practice test provided is much more indicative of the actual length and difficulty of the test, and it comes with a scale score conversion chart so you can see how well you would do in comparison to other high school students."
1,disappointing customer service,"my son is studying to do the SAT tests and this book, together with the CD, was well recomended. I was really disappointed when the CD didn't come. I called already the customer service twice, but never receive any reply. I'm returning the book and buy in the local bookstore."
1,"It is NOT noiseless, not even ""virtually noiseless""!","This waterproof mattress pad is advertised as ""virtually noiseless"". It krinkles loudly! We have two other waterproof mattress pads on a couple of our kids twin beds and they are truely ""virtually noiseless"". I returned this one and will go to our local bedding/linen store and buy a true quiet waterproof mattress pad cover there."
2,Nonthing special here,"I enjoyed the book, so when I found the soundtrack to the movie, I decided to get it. Overall, I was disapointed with the CD. The music just seems to fade into the background of the room or something. Persoanly, I feel that all the music on the soundtrack is basicaly the same. Just slow, lonley sounds over and over."
5,Fun and Easy to watch,I really enjoyed this movie because it's just so easy and fun to watch. it's the kind of movie that I can see myself popping in the dvd player saturday mornings and just lounging out while laughing myself silly. It acomplishes everything it sets out to do
4,Root for the murderer,"Usually in a murder mystery, you want the murderer to get caught. Well, with Lord Loudwater (what a name!) I was really rooting for the killer to get away with it.Was it the suffering wife? The wife's boyfriend? The ex-fiance? Did the butler do it? Great motivations and a detective who is amusing to watch (got to avoid those scandals!)This is set in post WW1 England.Short, as many of the time were, and free for the Kindle.The only reason for not giving it 5 stars is the atrocious ending. I really hate it when an author uses a sledgehammer to make their point."
3,Loudwater Mystery,"This book was a bit predictable. The era the book was written in is reflected in the sentimental treatment of true love, yet there is a certain hardness of the characters as well. It was well worth the price!"
3,Smaller than it looks in the picture,"This item is functionally adequate, but too small to be stylish for a man. I felt like I was carrying a man purse, so I gave it to my wife to use. She likes it better than I did."
1,She's Back,"When a group of thugs break into their house, the husband is beat up and Carrie Fisher is murdered. She returns from the grave wanting her husband to kill all of the guys who were responsible for her death. I guess this is supposed to be a dark comedy, but its not funny, and the movie draggs on."
1,nope,Sorry Juve this is a disgrace to my cd collection. Yo first one was tight but this on e sint gon cut it. No Limit's comin back so ya'll better watch out
1,has cash money fallen off?,"the answer, YES! granted 400 degrees is a classic. cash money could have come just a little bit tighter on this cd... these are the people that brought 'ha,' 'back that azz up,' 'bling bling,' and many other favorites, BUT they fell short on this effort... after lil' wayne and now this i think it's time for cash money to relinquish the throne they took from no limit and hand it over to the RUFF RYDERS! it's a new era because cash money has fallen off"
3,J.J.MIND ON THE G-CODE,"THE G IN G-CODE MUST STAND FOR GARBAGE! THE ONLY SONGS WORTH LISTENING TO WERE U-UNDERSTND,G-CODE,DA MAGNOLIA,AND THAT FIRE.EVERYTHING ELSE SUCKED"
5,Tha G Code Whodey,"I really enjoyed the album especially the song entitled ""Ya Understand"" I would encourage anyone who has never listen to Juvenile to try him out."
3,haters just don't UNDERSTAND,"YO, IT'S ASSASSIN FROM DEATHSQUAD. SEE ALL YOU HIP HOP PURISTS NEED TO UNDERSTAND, THAT JUVINILE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER 15 YEARS AND HE KNOES HIS STUFF. ALSO JUVINILE HAS WHAT YOU WOULD CALL A LIMITED VOCABULARY AND FINDS IT EASIER TO MAKE ALL THOSE CUTE WHITE GIRLS ON TRL ""BACK THAT AZZ UP"" THAN GO ONE ON ONE WITH LYRICAL GREAT ONES. PEOPLE ARE BUYNG HIS MUSIC BECAUSE IT'S FUN AND YOU CAN DANCE TO IT. JUVINILE IS NOT CHUCK D NOR RAKIM, HE'S NOT GOING TO COME OUT WITH SOME RIVETING POLITCAL RHYMES NOR DEEP METAPHORS, HE'S JUST GOING TO MAKE YOU BOUNCE. AND WITH 2 MILLION PLUS OWERS OF ""400 DEGREZ"" I THINK PEOPLE ARE STARTING TO UNDERSTAND."
3,Stright!,"If you like his first album 400 degrees then this album has a few tracks for you. 4,5,10-14 are good. But if you havnt bought his first album and dont like Juvy then you WILL NOT LIKE HIS ALBUM OR HIS STYLE SO ""DONT BUY IT"" unless you are a Juvy fan!"
3,Wheres the swearing,"Ive just purchased this album today and was really excited at the prospect of obtaining Juveniles album in my country (where rap,unfortunately,is not at all in the mainstream).I arried home and instantly hit the play button,when to my horror i had unknowingly purchased the EDITED version,F$%K,were my thoughts exactly.The edited version gives you a distorted sound at every ocasion either Juve or one of the Cash Money Click swears this is exteramly irritating.I hope to exchange it for the unedited version,because this is too much to bere.I would have without dout given this album 5 stars if it was unedited and would advise evryone to get it.So the reason i have done this review is to warn people to MAKE SURE YOU DONT BUY THE EDITED VERSION."
1,"Whoot, There it is, Whoot There it Was, Whoot, There it Went",You guys remember 95 South don't you? Well Juvenile and the CMC are the 2nd coming of 95 South. In a couple 3 years no one will remember who the hell these fools were. Will the south rise again? Or will it just recycle its wack meaningless so-called rap styles one mo gen? Outkast being the exception of course.
4,this cd is a trip!,"methods of mayhem is new music guarenteed to soak your brain. You need to go buy this cd if you haven't yet. Definately a plus for you subwoofer holders. PLAY IT LOUD, just like it says so on the cd."
5,this cd rocks,"this is a great cd i like tommy lee better this way than when he was with motley crue this is a must have for and music lover kidrock, fred durst, little kim are all great on this cd all thats missing is pamela naked on the cd cover"
5,rockin',This is a very good come back for recent porn star and should be acknowledge for his excellent effort. Awesome Album
2,It's amazing what fame can do for you,"Let me just say this plain and simple this cd sound like a bunch of garbage that was put together in a week. Tommy Lee's famous so he can get all these guests to appear no problem. I dont even care that hes hoppin on tha bandwagon, the album just doesnt have any continuity to it. New Skin is a cool song and i made the mistake of buying it after hearing that song. Tilo doesnt even get a chance to show his talent(I dont know if he has any)Overall I'd say there are 2 or 3 decent songs on the album. It just sounds like someone trying too hard when theyre not even into it."
5,Excellent!,I absolutely loved this whole series. I read them so fast because I just couldn't put them down and now I will have to read them again and take my time! I especially liked Larkin's fun loving character in this book.
3,Vampire bandwagon not working for Roberts,"At first I thought this was going to be better than the first, but it's not. Everything as far as love goes is just a bit too easy for the characters. None of the drama comes from the romance. A good romance novel gets its drama from both the external circumstances and the blooming love between the characters, but Roberts does not pull that off in this book. Additionally, there's a distinct homophobia in the novel (in the form of the vampire queen having a female lover and the two of them ""threatening"" to not only vamp characters, but turn them into lesbians). This left a bit of a bad taste in my mouth."
5,Excellent continuation,"I loved the first book and Dance of the Gods managed to keep me entranced with the adventure, romance and magic. I couldn't wait to read the last book. This is one of her best trilogies."
5,Excellent and fun!,Nothing more to be said but that is is a great book. I loved it. Will be one that I keep to read over again in the future.
5,DANCE OF THE GODS:BOOK 2 OF THE CIRCLE TRILOGY) NORA ROBERTS,The story itself is great after all it is Nora Roberts!The book arrived in the condition advertised.(No marked pages and no bent or torn pages.) I would definitly buy from this seller again.
4,i love nora,"I liked this book a lot but this type of book (vampires, witches and the like) is not something everyone would enjoy."
4,She's always so good at all the little details!,Fun to see all sides of her characters. You can almost watch the stories unfold - she describes so well!
5,very good,Great reading! Love the wizardry mixed with vampire effects in this book. The love between the charactors are intense. All over great story!
3,Vampire Fantasy,"Having been a Nora Roberts fan for awhile and love to read anything ""Irish"", I'm reading my way thru this trilogy. Dance is okay but not as good as the first in the trilogy, Morrigan's Cross. Maybe because the first one had more character development, I enjoyed it more. It's a great story and an interesting read if you're into fantasy and vampires. The third in the series, Valley of Silence, is next on my reading list! Nora continues to write ""can't put it down until I finish"" books."
2,Ughhh...,"Not very happy with this coffee maker. No matter what I did, the coffee never tasted as good as this coffee maker's' predecessor made. Tried to save a little money. You live and you learn."
2,"wordy, too much detail, too theoretical",This book snow-balls the reader with tons of trivial details that have little to do with clinical endodontic practice. It provides a confusing picture of how to function clinically. Out of touch with reality. I don't know why it is so standard in dental schools. Most undergraduates probably couldn't use more than 10% of it.
4,"Yes, they do fit and tighten down","I was a little hesitant to purchase these mounts as the feedback was either very good or quite bad. I took the chance as I really didn't want to replace the entire receiver on my crosman 1322 to mount a scope.I found that the mounts tighten down just fine. No stripping or slipping.I suspect the issue folks have had may center more around the fact that the crosman mounts are 3/8"" which will not allow a standard 1"" ring to securely fasten on to the mount. I had to purchase new rings that convert from the 1"" tube down to the 3/8"" rail mount.Using these new rings allowed me to securely fasten both the mounts to the barrel and the scope to the mounts. I have fired over 100 pellets at full power and the scope hasn't budged.Maybe other folks had different issues with tightening but everythiing worked fine for me. I would recomment buying the mounts."
4,"Crosman 459MT 2 pc. Intermount, 3/8 dovetail","I have several Daisy 7XX series pellet guns. I recently purchased one that had this mount. I asked the seller where he got it, as the mounts for these guns are hard to find. He sent me the part numbers and I purchased two of them. I am very satisfied, and they work great as a 3/8 dovetail mount."
4,good enough.,"DO have the problem of being a bit loose but could be solved easily by adhesive tape. Directly mounted on the barrel of crosman 1377 so no worries about alignment when installing the sight. Tightens well'using HEX SOCKET CAP SCREWS, no problem with the screws at all."
1,Crosman Scope Mount 459MT,The mounts were sold as specific for the pistol...The mounts do not secure well to the barrel and I should have returned them...just haven't done it yet...Save your money...
3,Flawed but not entirely worthess,"The problem with these is that the bottoms don't reach far enough around the barrel, so they can rotate around it and a scope mounted on them will slide side to side. I put a few strips of duct tape on the ends to tighten them up and my scope feels pretty solid now, but unless you plan on doing some modifications there's probably a better option then these."
4,They do the job...,"For what it's worth, they do the jog just right for less than $10. A most..! Use it with a very light scope."
4,Great Infield Glove,Great Price!! Product is exactly what the specs. say. I am a better infeilder because of it. Super Shipping!!!
2,"They're cute, but dangerous","I bought these tub grippers for my slippery tub only to find they moved very easily once applied. This made the tub grippers a slip hazard I paid for with my shin. Anyway, they are awfully cute, so I stuck them on the guest bathroom mirror for now... I really don't know what else to do with them. My slippery bathtub is less dangerous without them than with them!"
5,1 of the Best,"I've been listening to Phish for the past 4 years. This is one of my favorite shows. There really isn't such thing as a bad Phish show, but this one is just awesome. Also, the Cd Organizer is great for the Whole set of live phish (which I do have all 6 volumes.) I recommend 100%!!"
4,LIVE PHISH VOLUME SIX-YOU SHOULD READ THIS,"It was very cold, and the night after Thanksgiving. The scene outside the show was not pleasant. We made our way through the crowd, and found our place. The music came on, and we forgot about the nastiness.That night, Phish played one of the best shows that I have ever seen them perform. Listening to this CD, It becomes even more clear now. The set-list is incredible, and the sound is excellent. It is the best release of all of the live Phish recordings thus far.There are some great old tunes; Ya Mar, Runaway Jim, Buried Alive, and Dog Log. It's a great show, and serves to remind that it is the music that really counts."
5,Music to throw fists to,"This volume should be labeled the Wipeout Show. If it doesn't get you fired up and throwing fists you're probably dead...check your pulse and call 911. This adreniline pumping album is why we love phish and travel to see 'em. If you're depressed about their recent departure from the scene, pop in disc two and absorb it all in with a smile on your face..."
1,Expensive and useless,"I loved my Rubis perforated #135 tweezers which served me well for over 15 years. When I lost them, I thought I would try the slant/point combo. These tweezers are set up so that the points come together precisely, but the leading edges of the slant do not. So the tip resembles something like this /\. There is not enough material in the tip area to grab the hair firmly (they are very sharp). Therefore, the tweezers do not grab the hair and it just slips right out. It is very frustrating. I cannot recommend them. They are for all intents and purposes useless."
2,"For me, not the best for the money","As always, I was looking for the ideal pair of tweezers. Wished for precision and ""hold"" when tweezing. I researched these, and placed the order. When I used the tweezers, they were very ""scratchy,"" and did not have the strongest pull (hair slipped out of the tweezers because they didn't grab strongly enough). The search continues..."
2,Listen to the mp3 version,"When I`m not sure of buying something I check out if a cd version is out. In this case Yes and I did listen to the first three song and Ugh Yak and what not,this is not a show I will buy."
3,"Perfect solution, if it doesn't fall apart","Bought two of these magnetic paper towel holders for the refrigerator at work--one for the microwave side and one for the sink side. There is zero counter space and no ""under cabinet"" space, so this was the perfect solution. Nice strong magnet--you can place this horizontally or vertically anywhere you like.HOWEVER....I am updating this review, as one of the magnets completely detached from the plastic holder after a month. The other holder is functioning fine, almost two years later, still clinging to the refrigerator."
3,Negligent glued,"The magnet strip came detached from the plastic suport. I tried to fix it with some universal glue, but it didn't hold. Later my husband said that I have to clean and sand both surfaces, in order to get a good grip. Sooooo...I bought a piece of sandpaper, prepared the plastic suport and the magnet strip and glued again. Now I have a functional item. The magnet is strong enough to hold the item and the paper rol the dor of the fridge."
4,Real Space-Saver,"I used to be able to find these in stores but now can only find them online. It allows me to put my paper towels on the fridge rather than taking up counter space or putting holes in cabinets or walls. It's very basic, but does the job. The magnet could be a little stronger, but is strong enough to keep it secure when I rip towels off with one hand."
2,disappointing photos,"I love the movie, Moulin Rouge is (at the moment) my favorite movie of all time. I am glad to have this book, but the pictures are very poor, almost all too dark, compare poorly to the DVD. Many others are way too small, there's a fair amount of blank space in this book. If you have the DVD, the bonus material covers most of what is in the book (on Disk 2). When I read a previous review that said ""The pictures are bright and beautiful"" I actually went back and flipped through the book again... virtually all the pictures from the actual movie are way too dark, the shots during production are OK, and the red print on black background is unreadable (illegible). So I'd advise you review a copy before purchasing."
4,IDog is Pretty Cute,"The iDog is very cute, but he takes a long time to get going and sucks batteries down in record time. Too bad, because he's a nice way to play your music."
1,BORING!!!,"My friend got this for her birthday and we played with it for about 5 minutes then we got bored and didnt play with it for awhile. Then the next day she went to listen to it and it didnt work! So she got a new one and we still got bored with it, all it does is move its head and ears and lights a circle on its head up! I mean its cute but boring! Id rather get some speakers and stare at them! (plus you could get cuter speakers for less than this toy!)"
4,"Fun toy, with an occassional real use.","This is a fun little toy. As a couple of middle age adults my wife and I enjoy iDogs antics by the speaker when we go online and check out new music. A fairly frequent occurance. The dog has traveled to work a few times, but is never left there because of theft dangers. Who could resist right? Meanwhile, it makes for an okay portable speaker when your very close to it. But, it can't hold up against background noise when say your in a kitchen doing dishes. Still the speaker function is fairly useful. The cables for the earphone jack suck, so we don't use it like that. Too bad. Also, With fairly heavy use batteries last about three weeks. Fairly short time. But, every dog needs feeding right."
2,Not worth much,"Cute product, and my kids liked it at first, but the sound quality is so poor, and the volume is so low that my kids stopped using it after the first day. You can barely hear this, unless the room is absolutely silent, and you are sitting right next to it. The movement is a bit noisy too, which doesn't help. I wish I had paid more for the IDog AMPED version, which my friends are happy with. Volume is just way too low to enjoy this product, even with the Mp3 player turned up all the way."
5,i can't wait till i get an iDog,"hi everyone! i am fourteen and i think that the iDog will be a great accessory for my iPod. i hope that i get one for christmas and a bag for it too! it looks like a fun, new, and interesting way to play my music. i also like the fact that it doesn't have to be plugged in and i can take it when i go on trips, i'm going to take the advice of one of the reviewers and i am going to get some rechargeable batteries."
3,Cute is about it.,"The speaker is not loud. It is more of a ""pet"" type toy than a listening devise. Don't buy it if you are looking for a speaker system for your MP3 or Ipod. It was only used on Christmas and now has been forgotten."
1,Don't waste your money!,"This dog is a total waste of money! All it does is dance and sings. It's a disapointment. This toy i got to admit is cute, but it isn't worth it. you can bye speakers less than this idog that are a lot better than this piece of crap!"
3,I dont have it but I saw it,I dont have this toy! But I want it really badly! I have an ipod mini. I also looove dogs! It looks soo cute in person! I am getting it though. Tell u how it is!
4,Gu Energy Gel Keeps Me Going,Gu Energy Gel gives me the extra energy I need mid ride to keep going. Very quick absorption. I've been able to find three of four flavors that I like (everyone's preference seems to be different). Some other gel products upset my stomach. Not this one.
4,Just started using these,"They seem to work if used as directed - take 1 15 minutes before activity, and then another at each 45-minute interval. I've found my endurance has improved since I've been using them. The texture is a little gagging at first but you get used to it. It's a little better if you keep them refrigerated. I prefer the fruity flavors over the chocolate and peanut butter flavors."
4,Gu Energy Gel,These gels work great on the road for a quick burst of energy. They are a bit of a problem to dispose of and to avoid a sticky mess on your fingers and pockets.
5,Long distance runners best friend,"Ihad a chance to try almost all the energy gels, since a freinf of mine brought me every kind of gel as a gift pack. GU was my choice after this trial, due it's taste and boost. I' use them on long runs, longer than 20km. Every 45 mintues to 1 hour period is good to take a new one. '""Just Plain"" taste is my favorite, since don't like the flavours after a while. GU makes the best tasting gels, but after taking 3-4 packs, the taste disturbes me. So I decided to go on with plain test. Easy to carry on a fuel belt, easy to open and good to eat&drink. The only problem I have with GU is to import them over amazon to Turkey where I live. I solved this problem via a cargo forwarding system. I recommend this item to every runner and endurance athlet."
4,Lightweight compact quick boost,"I always carry and occasionally use GU on backpacking and day-hiking trips. No preparation, very lightweight and compact non-perishable ""food"" stashed in my pack indefinitely for when I start to drag and feel ""out of gas"" during a long hiking day, still have miles to go, and have no appetite for a larger meal (especially at higher elevation). Because orange is the only flavor that appeals to me, I have not tried the other flavors."
5,GU for you!,"It cost a few pennies but it will give you an energy boost so you can keep on going! I take one before the run, and one every 45 minute thereafter."
5,wouldn't run without it,"Bought to use for marathon training and the race, this is a good flavor that does the trick re energizing"
5,good product,"Great product and very well packaged. My husband and I use these for fuel on long runs and they work out perfectly. Easy to carry in pockets/hydration packs and no stomach issues related to the product. Fast carbs are important to us as my husband is diabetic and has a lot of concerns when marathon training. We have tried the chocolate (Hubby is a fan, I'm not a big chocolate person... I think it's the texture combined with the flavor that bugs me), tri-berry (two thumbs up) and strawberry banana (this is the one we keep ordering)."
1,Buy Your Gu Elsewhere,"The vendor used by Amazon is terrible. I ordered a 24-case of GU over a month ago, and have not received my order. I wasn't told that the product was backordered until after I made my purchase, and the vendor gave me three consequective back order dates. Due to this major inconvenience I have canceled the order. Don't order GU through Amazon."
1,how did the narrator get this job?,"The story was good (I think) but the narration was bland and the narrator spoke way too fast, way, way too fast. I checked the speed on my iPhone twice to be sure it wasn't me speeding up the reading. He pretty much ruined the story for me. I forced myself to listen for an hour and that was all I could take. And who is the narrator? I can't seem to find his name anywhere. Perhaps Brilliance Audio doesn't want to publish this, too bad because he would definitely be on my do-not-read list. Does anyone know of a mac app that will slow down an audio book narration?"
1,Invest your time in real literature.,One ought wonder why many radical Fundamentalists are so vocal about such a trite piece of fiction. David Morrell has produced a bigoted (anti-Catholic) piece of fiction which serves better to underscore the long way our culture has yet to go than it does to entertain.
4,Thriller about a Killer,"Not bad: Easy to read, fast-paced and inventive. If you liked it, read: The Day After Tomorrow by Alan Folsom (plus all old ones by Ludlum of course)..."
5,greatr book,i had the hard copy of this years ago and enjoyed re reading this again. would recommend it to the adventure thriller types.
5,David Morrell Tells Wickedly Good Stories...,"I was first ""introduced"" to David Morrell's writing through The Brotherhood of the Rose (my personal favorite among spy/espionage novels) not knowing that he also had written First Blood and several others. My reading choices are random and subject to my mood of the moment, yet I'll read BOTR, Fraternity of the Stone, and the companion book The League of Night and Fog time and time again - Morrell's style keeps me entranced and entwined within the stories - almost as if I'm living the events depicted fist-hand."
3,Funny and sweet,This is a lighthearted romp through the problems of being a vampire. The characters are loveable and the story develops with a variety of twists and turns that keeps you wondering how the hero will survive and win the love of his lady.
3,Amusing but kind of boring in a way...,"So i thought the book was funny but the characters are so flat.. and it seems like the main character, Shanna is always tearing up... There's not depth to the characters. It seems pretty predictable too all the ends tied up just too perfect for me. And everything happens so fast! Like Shanna meets Roman, they fall in love, the end.. and then along the way there's all this background story. Eh.. I would much rather read the Undead series by Mary Janice Davidson. Those i think are better.update:after finishing the last 30 pages, i want to give this book 2 stars! I mean it was sooo ridiculous how the author tried to wrap everything up in a nice big bow so that they had no more problems at all! I don't want to give it away because it was seriously sooo stupid. Like oh wow the cross doesn't burn you anymore? OMG it must be because *** anyways it was horrible!"
2,It wasn't for me,"I tried to enjoy this book, I really did. i enjoy paranormal romance, but this one was a bit too far fetched even for me. There weren't any believable aspects to this story."
2,God's Blood,"The one thing that bother me the most was the CONSTANT and VERY FREQUENT use of the words ""God's Blood"". This drove me insane and took away from the already sketchy storyline. The heroine of this book at many of times just downright got on my nerves. Sparks tried to make her both strong and independant while still making her seem fragile and incompetent and after a while it was just too much.One of the other things that aggravated was towards the end where Roman tells the villian is whole plan of attack. Ridiculous. The story could have been great but the execution was less than favorable. It took to long for things to happen and once things did happen it quickly ended. I was hoping for so much more and hope here other books will be better executed."
5,COULD NOT PUT IT DOWN!!!!,It has been so long since I have enjoyed a book this much. It caught me from the first page and I had to force myself to put it down at bed time. I can't wait to read the next book!!!
2,So-So book,"The book started off OK but there was a lot of repetition from the main characters. Roman wanted to be with Shanna but used the phrase ""God's Blood"" at least once a page if not more. Shanna, wanted to be with Roman but thought he might be crazy and then didn't wanted to be with him since he was a vampire."
3,Fun series,Kerrelyn Sparks did a great job with her Love at Stake series. I have read all the books to date and have enjoyed them. This the first of the series and sets the characters for the future installments. This has the romance and suspense that I find entertaining.
1,Cliche to the extreme,"I keep reading the book because it has an interesting plot, but I can only get through a few pages at a time because the scenes are so cliche. The main vampire character is very poorly developed. His outward persona versus his actions just don't match up. The story seems very stilted and it doesn't flow well. The scenes seem very scripted and like something you would expect a teenager to write in their first writing class. It had the potential to be a great story but I may never get through the end."
2,Would recomend however would not read again.,Its a once and done for me. I tend to rate books on how often I can stomach reading them.Once and done rating for this book. It had some good dialogue but lacked something. I just can't put my finger on what exactly it lacked but I'll know when I actually find a book that delivers.
3,If you liked Buffy maybe?,I found the book to be very funny and entertaining until the end when it feel utterly and completely apart.
2,Couldn't get into it.,"I just couldn't get into this book....While there were some funny parts, I was mostly let down. I bought this book after reading the back cover, thinking it would be one I coudn't put down. But after about the first chapter, I got bored. Finished it anyway, but most likely will donate it."
4,I'm Hooked,This book promises that the series will be worth reading. So far the story has left me intrigued by their world and purpose.
5,Daria is a refreshing delight,"Unlike MTV's other hit cartoons, Daria depends more on sarcastic and amusing humour instead of fart jokes and stupidity. This tape includes the first three episodes of the first season of Daria. They are all excellent, from ""Esteemsters"" which shows Daria and Jane taking a self esteem class. The reaction from Daria's workaholic mom, Helen is a hoot, ""We tell you over and over that you're wonderful and you just don't get it. What's WRONG with you!"" The second episode deals with Daria and Jane invited to a party by popular but mentally empty Brittany, and the third, ""College Bored,"" has Daria and her popular sister Quinn causing mayhem at a college. Daria is enlisted to do others homework for them. When her dumb father discovers this, he says, ""And you made them pay in cash. Good girl."" I love the razor sharp cynisism of Daria and Jane in a town populated by airheads."
2,Low Quality,This is very low quality - looks like the music videos were just recorded from tv and transferred to dvd. There isn't a menu and the sound quality is very poor. It was neat to see all of their videos though.
5,Every Female Should Read,This book is worth the time it takes you to read it! Every female should have a read. Some things it talks about are common sense ... others make you think abit. I've enjoyed all of Bach's books and this one has not let me down either.Good luck and happy saving!
5,Must Read,"This is an amazing book. The ideas are very much in line with Your Money or Your Life and The Millionaire Next Door. David Bach helps you to organize your finances, contemplate your values, set goals, and restructure your financial thinking to make them happen. This book will honestly help you to become smarter with your money. I can't recommend it highly enough."
2,smart women finish rich,I recieved the book in a timely matter but I wish the book was in better shape. I did get it at a much discounted price but i think I will think a bit more about making a book purchase again. The outer edges of the pages were yellowed and the book wasn't completely flat.
2,Update Needed!,"While there are many good ideas in this book and it contains sound philosophy, the present economy has rendered some of the advice suspect. Charts and tables given have people earning 10% interest for example! I wish. IRAs are one focus but when I went to my bank to discuss getting one, I found that money market accounts were getting a better interest rate currently than IRA's... and with a money market account the funds are available if you need them before retirement age. With updating, the book would be very good and helpful but as is, I am not sure if it has good information or not."
1,Conair GS16 Steamer,"Just unpacked the new Conair GS16 Steamer and followed directions to ""push up on the soleplate cover"" to remove. The flimsy plastic ""push up"" button broke right off. This cheap product meets the definition of cheap. Time to return it is more costly than the the thirty dollars cost. There is simply no way that this product will not break when directions are followed."
3,You Can Street Ball To It...,"New york underground rap in its pure form. However, If It had more freestyle battles like the 2nd track with Biggie and Tupac, This could of been a classic. But as it stands, I can only give it a 3."
4,THE TUNNEL,"The Tunnel In The 1990's And Early 2000's Was The Breeding Ground 4 Anything That Was Street In The North East, So This Album Reflex That. If The Album Had A Crown Jewel It Would Have To Be ""ILL BOMB"". The Song Basically Setup LL's Entire G.O.A.T. Album (Its Also On That Album As Well). There Are Alot Of Good Songs On Here. Buy It."
5,For Great Skin,"I found this, and other CoQ10 products to do exactly as it says. This antioxidant cream for mature skin has really given my skin a smooth appearance and a natural glow. I love it!"
2,Hit the Snooze Button,"Wish I had read the other reviews before I bought this. I was ready for some high energy dance music but what I got was a Kenny G sounding soft jazz soundtrack. Not at all what I expected. If you are feeling mellow, or too old for your disco shoes, this is the CD for you. I would leave my name but I'm too embarassed to admit I now own this CD."
2,Doesn't meet my expectations.,"I thought it would be nice to get an extra cup of coffee so Ipurchased the Hamilton Beach""AromaExpress""5cup Coffeemaker.Well,all I can say is that it comes dribbling out and if you want tosneak a cup,that even takes time.The Coffee was done,not evenfilled onehalf full.This Coffeemaker makes little cups so if youlike a bigger cup I would not recommend this one."
1,poor design and poor quality,"As the retired CEO of an engineering company, I concluded that this coffee maker's design and quality were poor. We threw it in the trash and bought another brand."
1,What A Mess!,Just got this brand new for the holidays and I'm here on line ordering a replacement already.Drips all over the place.Filter basket is VERY tricky to reinsert after emptying and sometimes slips back out.Coffee is just so-so.
3,"Cute bed, but quality is lacking.","This is a cute bed and is a good size for my small dog. I found it difficult to assemble though, and the plastic ""fabric"" was under such tension that it created a small hole in one corner when stretched over the frame. I wasn't able to use it due to this defect and will return to Amazon. In the meantime, I have purchased the Kukadu elevated pet bed from Amazon and I've found it to be a superior product."
1,The performance in Adam Bede is outdated and a bit stupid,"I was truly disappointed by this production. It was like a bad theater performance. The ill fated ""Heroine"" is irritatingly bad in her part and the ""good"" girl heroine is also irritating in her willed goodness, she is too good in a hypocritically way- Avoid this film - BBC ought to make a redo of this novel - Some of the older BBC productions do not survive time, and both Silas Marner - Along with Adam Bede - Proves to be outdated in my opinion."
1,OK,This was an okay movie. The character of Adam Bede was too emotional for me for a man. I would not tell my friends to buy or watch this movie. Only if they were truly bored and had nothing else to do.
3,Old Hat,"What did I expect? This is a dated tv movie made by the BBC when they were far more conservative than they are now. I very much like and admire the mature Iain Glen, but although he's painfully beautiful in ""Adam Bede"", his performance is considerably ""over the top"". Perhaps this is one of those old stories that just doesn't adapt as well as it could to modern views and ethics. Or maybe it's just a rather boring film."
4,Long live the King,"It's 1659 and the dour days of Cromwell's protectorate are drawing to a close, with the imminent return of King Charles 11. Ruth Morland soothes and comforts a desolate Prince Rupert who has witnessed the deaths of many of his friends in the final battle and who returns to the King without knowing that he has fathered Annunciata, a child who will feature in his future life. The Morland family has been left in dire straits with a great deal of their land sold off to a Cromwell follower and a vast amount of money gone to pay fines. Ralph Morland is eager to rebuild the family fortunes and agrees to 16 year old Annunciata going to the court , with her cousins, to help to put the family name forward and to possibly make a prosperous marriage. I really bonded with the characters in this episode of the Morland saga and can't wait for the next book as it ends in 1666 with London burning after the Great Plague."
4,"works extremely well, but poor instructions","This wireless indoor-outdoor thermometer works as advertised. Its remote sensors have very good range and seem quite accurate. It was frustrating to set up because the instructions were not very clear. Once you figure out how to set up the sensors and base, you should write down how you did it. If you don't write it down you'll get frustrated when you have to change the batteies in one of the sensors."
3,So So movie - ridiculous packaging,"I've always thought this was the weakest of the Narnia books. More a collection of short stories than a cohesive story. The movie misses as a 2 hour story, but also misses as a collection of short stories. Liked the cast though and the effects were good enough. Hopefully they will continue with the series. I'd like to see them make it to The Last Battle. It's hard to imagine them not politically correcting it to death. As for the package you might as well store the movies on the floor, because that's where they will end up every time you touch the case."
5,Fast shiping,Very fast shipping. The product was in the exact condition that they described and it was the product that I actually wanted!!!
3,good movie bad case,do yourself a favor and buy a different blu-ray of this movie... the case is so ich... when you open it up the sides are real flimsey... the dvd/blu-ray falls out... Their was a TON of scratches on the blu-ray when I first opened it because of the case. thankfully most of them could wipe off.
4,Great movie!,"I saw this in the theater and really enjoyed it. Some die-hard fans of the book may not care for the fact that a couple of the scenes are a bit different than in the book, but I thought that just made the movie better; same with the couple of stuff the writers added into the movie.That's not saying the movie is perfect, though. Some scenes (like at the Lone Island) could've been longer.And I have to say, I really liked how they came into Narnia and met Caspian again. It was so much better than the BBC miniseries version.As for the DVD itself, I though it was interesting that the 2 discs came in 2 separate cases instead of in the same case. Don't really care for that, though. I'd've preferred to have the 2 discs in the same case like Prince Caspian."
3,Not as good as the last one.,Very slow parts. Not very good editing. Not near as good of a story line. Would not watch it again. Uninteresting.
3,Scratched DV,"It came with considerably more scratches than I had expected, and freezes so that the whole movie cannot be watched."
5,The Best Narnia Yet!,"The DVD arrived timely and plays perfectly. And for the first time, I got to watch all of the first three Chronicles of Narnia back-to-back. Both, in terms of imagery and messages, Voyage of the Dawn Treader is definitely my favorite! I'm praying that, esoecially with the ""unveiling"" of The Narnia Code, the rest of the Narnia Chronicles will be hitting the screen ASAP!"
4,best of series,"Though I can say I've enjoyed the entire series of the Narnia films, I do believe this one is the best.They wrapped the trilogy up nicely with a great story line."
2,disappointed in 3d edition,i for one am disappointed in this. the first was better and it was not in 3d. nothing came out of the screen and basically i found it quite boring. i would not recommend this if you want 3d that comes out of the screen.
3,Not like the first two,I didn't enjoy this movie as much as the first two. It felt like the plot was rushed and ended abruptly. The quality of the acting was great as usual. It just wasn't what I was expecting.
5,A great movie by the Disney Studios,"I have watched this movie before. Absolutely love The Chronicals of Narnia movies. I highly recommend for the entire family, for young and old alike. This is for everyones collections."
2,Not based off of the original story,"I decided to go see this movie in theaters the day it came out. Bad idea. I will admit that it was enjoyable if you never read the book. Personally the book was way better. And the movie is very loosely based on the book. So if you never have read the book, you will probably like the movie. If you have read the book, this is your warning. lol"
2,A terrible adaptation and a mediocre movie.,"Having watched and loved the first 2 Narnia Films I was disappointed to see how terrible of an adaptation this was. Someone who had seen the film but hadn't read the book wouldn't even be able to give you the plot of the book. As far as the quality of the film, it is pretty lame. The script is terrible, the special effects are worse than the 2 previous films, and the camerawork is also terrible, shaking around and zooming way into their faces so much it feels as if your watching a big homefilm a lot of the time. And the plot is rather lame too. We are never told what the green mist is or what it wants, or even why it tempts people. Just a big disappointment."
3,Did they even read the book?,"The only reason I gave it any stars is that the cast is beyond cute and the movie is fun. But they veered away from the book so many times that I wondered if the screen writers read it at all. Why? They think they can do better than C.S. Lewis? The book is full of adventure and nothing needed to be changed. Many times during the movie, I found myself saying, ""What the ...?"" I hope the next movie they make sticks closer to the book, but so far the track record for this series is not good."
2,Pretty graphics; doesn't work,"Let's face it. The books don't translate well to film. On its own, this film is choppy and incoherent with no character development, just one brief inexplicable sequence after another. Has no message and doesn't make a lot of sense. The acting is generally second rate. Liberties were taken with the book as well. All that can be said of it is is that it is sometimes beautiful to look at (scenes of the Dawn Treader on the ocean, for example).Rent, don't buy, or skip altogether."
4,Good Movie,This was a good movie but it was not as good as the first or the second. I missed having the other 2 children in the story more. I would recommend seeing it to complete the trilogy.
3,Beautiful But Small,"This is a beautiful shoe, well-made with very nice detailing. I had been looking for a shoe like this for a long time and was so pleased to find it in a WW width. It was such a disappointment, however when I tried them on. They were way too tight! I looked for the width on the shoe and couldn't find it. If width is not a concern for you, I would order them. It was with great disappointment that I had to return them."
5,He reminds me of my Old Platoon Leader!,Gunny is one smart and funny guy that covers a subject that he just loves - Military History. This film is a good solid effort by him. So if you want to increase your basic military knowledge then head on over to this DVD.The Marines should rightly be proud of him!
1,Substandard,I agree with the previous two reviews. The screw was not even parallel with the threaded nut. I had to insert several washers under one side when mounting it. I thought I could save a few bucks by using the Shop Fox. Do yourself a favor-spend a little bit more money and buy a decent one.
2,I ignored the other reviews... a mistake I won't make again.,"Eventhough, there were more negative reviews, I decided it couldn't be that bad and I ordered... not one, but 2. LOL The press clamp, isn't complete garbage for the price I paid (something like 12-13 bucks). But, it is bordering on it. Mainly it is the screw that turns me off. The screw is rough and sharp... and I mean sharp like a serrated blade. You do not want to run your fingers over it!!! One of the holes for the screw that goes into the handle was machined crooked. And both of the press nuts are loose. But, what was I expecting for the price. I'm not sure... but, if I were Shop Fox, I would be ashamed to put my name on this product."
2,A lot of baby pictures,"This is a silent movie, with music. You don't get to hear anyone's voice. The baby pictures are endless. There is disappointingly little about JFK,Jr. after he was 3. This would be an o.k. video for the older generation who mostly remember him as a baby; but for the baby boomers and after it was the adult who was ""Sexiest Man Alive"" who was interesting, not the toddler."
4,"Not perfect, but very close","I am homeschooling my 14 yr old son and needed some structure for a Physical Education program. I was hoping this book would provide me with that structure. It's not exactly what I was hoping for (a fill in the blank type of map), but it has given our P.E. program some depth. What I think it does best is acknowledge that homeschool groups can be small. There are games and sports designed for as few as two players. With this one book, I will be able to keep my son (and me) active. I will have to add other resources (rules for regulation play on team sports), but this book is a good resource for the homeschooling family."
2,Disappointing,"Cap does not say on well. Every time I open my purse to get it, the cap in off. I'd return it but it's too much of a hassle for such a cheap item."
1,pokemon leaf green,the pokemon leaf green i got is a fake and i want my money back and i hate it bad
5,Great Western Series,"Best tv western anthology series ever. Great stories, great stars, great fun. I recommend this series very highly and am eagerly awaiting the release of Season Two."
2,Incorrect Pages,"I love this book, so I bought one of my own from Amazon. Unfortunately, the pages were not in the aplabetical order and I was missing pages K-R and the pages S-Z were duplicated. Make sure when you get your book, it is the correct pages! I noticed this a little too late."
4,This is not a toy,"Amazon wants me to treat this hobby glue as a toy, and it is obviously not that. In fact, this stuff is rather nasty (well, compared to Elmers or something) and I would not give it to kids ever. It is not Elmers. But is does dry clear unlike Elmers and it seems to bond pretty well. I used this for a metal and wood project and not sure it's ideal for that. More experienced modelers can probably give you better info."
3,slow pace very detail instructions good for beginner,She does a great job explaining and demonstrating the proper techniques. I appreciate this in the beginning but after awhile the pace is way to slow. I still have not found a video that equals the workout I get from my YMCA class that only takes an 1/2 hour. I suggest the moria have two segments on the DVD. A get to know the workout segment and then the workout itself.
3,Interesting concept,"A sleazy producer gets an idea for a reality show, he puts five ""sexy"" girls in a real haunted house and offers them a potential one million dollars if they survive the night.This is low budget and the acting isn't always great, but it isn't all bad. With a budget it could have been a big movie. My big complaint would be that there wasn't enough story, and it was too fast. The whole thing is 72 minutes long, so there was no opportunity to build up any suspense. Also, it would have been nice if there was a more serious explanation as to why the house was haunted and a better attempt at trying to get rid of the ghosts. A few tweaks of the script and it would have been sweet."
2,NO IMAGINATION IN KILLINGS,"This is a low budget version of ""The Task."" 5 babes are locked in a genuine rigged haunted house and must spend the night and perform certain tasks based on their fears. The movie starts out with the producer begging for money to do the pilot. As he gets what he wants he walks out of the office to some great heavy metal swagger music, but there is no slo-mo swagger to go with the music. I mean how much would that cost?The eventual killing of said babes lacks imagination. It is just plain slash and remove guts. No imagination in writing. The movie had potential, and if it was tweaked it would have been worth a view.F-bomb, No nudity."
5,"Great, fun pop music.","Catatonia haven't reinvented the wheel, but they don't need to. This album is really great, fun music. The kind of songs you'll tap your toe to and sing in the shower the next day. There are no skippers on this album, and the US release adds Road Rage and Mulder & Skully, both taken from their excellent, but now sadly out-of-print, International Velvet album.And I must say that Ms. Matthews has probably the coolest, and cutest, voice ever."
4,Not you run of the mill type of heroine!!!,"To be honest, I had mixed feeling about this book!! The book wasn't at all dull but it reminded me of how I feel towards The Conan the Barbarian and Alien movies. They weren't great excellent movies but they were still good. Well, that's how I feel towards this book. I love C.J Cherryh later works... this collection were her earlier works. In my opinion, I think, at that time she was trying to find her place in the writing world.I believe the more she had written the better she got!! I think she is a great writer and knows how to executes her characters flawlessly. Her characters Morgaine and Vanye were complex, strange and unusal to understand. I feel thier relationhip was very complicated, if it wasn't, it wouldn't be a good story. This book was exciting at times but I feel somehow its still missing something!!"
4,"Good, but not perfect CD Player","I bought this CD player after my other CD player decided to stop working (running 24/7 for several months didn't treat it well), and while generally pleased with it (sounds great, works fine, yadda, yadda) I have a few nits to pick: The functionality embodied on the remote is not present on the front of the unit, annoying if you loose the remote; sometimes it plays through all five discs, sometimes not. Other than that, a good player."
2,Good but outdated,"This well written, thoughtful book was written in 1993, and badly needs to be updated. The technologies have changed (batteries, motors, controllers), and the candidates for cars to convert have changed (for example, you need to be very careful with the computer-driven dashboards and controls of most cars built in the past 8-10 years).It is a little shocking that this book (and Bob Brant's Build Your Own Electric Vehicle, published in 1994 and not upbdated) are the only ones available for this exciting, rapidly changing field."
3,A Classic,"Having built and developed several electrical vehicles and prototypes, I put this book up there among the classics as a good introduction for anyone interested in building an electrical conversion vehicle. I worked on my first vehicle in 1989 and I wish that I had some of the helpful hints that are provided in this book to asist me along. By the way, ironically, possessing two PhD,s ; one in in Electrical Engineering, I have been struck by lightening twice. The first was when I was working on my first electric/solar vehicle."
5,GREAT SWEDISH DRAMA SERIES,"The wonderful Van Veeteren series is based on the books by one of Sweden's best drama writers, Hakan Nesser. This 1st series is truly suspenseful, intense, wonderfully acted and written. Each different story begins with a whodunnit, brutal murder or 2. Van Veeteren, with the input of his 2 proteges, then procedes to dig deep into each case no matter where his investigation leads him."
4,"Nonstop Action-- Oh, and The Snake Is Still Loose","Frantic would probably be the best word to describe this mystery. Connor also has her usual high body count. However, in this case the reader also learns a little more about Diane Fallon's backstory.Of course there are a lot of people who are giving a synopsis of this book so I will skip that part. What the faithful reader needs to know is that this book has all the virtues of her previous books in this series and avoids the worst pitfalls."
4,"Looks cool, but wrinkles easily & not as soft as I'd hoped",I really LOVE the look of these sheets & I got them on Amazon for a great price. One of my complaints about these sheets is that they wrinkle so easily. I can take them straight out of the dryer and put them on the bed & they get so wrinkled I take out my iron to make them look neat once I've made the bed--it bothers me so much. The other thing I read in another review and I must agree on is that they really aren't as soft as I'd expect.
3,Instructions Stink,"The radio seems to be o.k. except for the fact that it turns itself off approximately 3 seconds after the power button is selected. The instructions are atrocious and probably are best relocated to a bird cage or outhouse. I'm still trying to comprehend how to adjust the auto turn-off feature. I haven't reached the point of ""slamming it against the wall"" but that may happen soon. It's obvious that the radio is well constructed and the sound is fine for the three seconds it's on. Unfortunately, the accompanying instructions are the worst I have ever encountered for a radio of this type. Maybe the factory could have someone from Panasonic or Sony write future instructions."
1,Where is the shortwave and SSB???,"This radio receives FM broadcast and AM fine, but shortwave and SSB on Shortwave is all but existant! I have tried to return this radio, have it repaired, and still not even a word or an ""I'm sorry"" DO NOT BUY THIS, IT IS MORE TROUBLE THAN YOU WANT, AND IT DOES NOT RX SHORTWAVE OR THE SSB BANDS! THAT IS A SIMPLE ENOUGH REVIEW, AND AN HONEST ONE. I HAVE BEEN A HAM FOR 11 YEARS AND NEVER HAD A NEW RADIO TO BE SUCH A PIECE OF GARBAGE! LOOKS LIKE I EVEN HAVE TO LITIGATE TO MAKE THEM BUY IT BACK, AND IT IS JUST 2 MONTHS OLD!!!"
4,Wow!,"Ephemera for the Future lived up to great reviews I read in The Big Takeover and elsewhere. This CD has all the ringing guitars of Big Star-style pop with the added bonus of singer Beth Filla's warm, direct delivery. It's not a retro, by-the-numbers power pop album, but ""If I Could Only Get Out of This Chair"" is a perfect, fat-free pop single. The mellower songs, like ""Jupiter Light"" and ""Petal Steel"", are what separate the album from the pack. Great stuff!"
4,Culture in the Middle East,"A thoughtful movie about young adults, gay and straight, Arab and Israelan who try to live a modern life in Tel Aviv but their lives are destroyed by circumstances beyond their control. It makes you feel that you are living in the city because the director films many scenes outdoors. The ending is tragic and is a bit of letdown as it seems to be saying ""love does not conquer years of acrimony."""
5,"If you wanna Rock, come and get it","Well, what can I say, if you want to move your head with the Hard Rock's rythm, you gotta buy this CD.Just with the first song you get submerged in a world of amazing choirds, brilliant guitards and a voice that is right now, and in my opinion, the banner of the Rock-Metal scene: Jorn Lande.This guy is just a box full of surprises. In other albums you hear him singing as a power metal guy, then as a Hardrocker, no words for that.The production is reaaaaally good (as usual with these guys) and I'm sure you won't find any complaint in this spotless album.Doesn't matter what kind of music you listen, this album is gonna get you from the first second and it won't let you go until you break your vocal cords singing like hell. Good stuff."
5,"After 7 years, this book still has all the right stuff!!","I read books, participate in webinars and am constantly looking for ""gems"" that will provide new insights and/or remind me of the right things to do in the sales process.This book cut through all the BS (pardon my French), and provided concrete steps in the sales process to enhance and expedite the sale of profitable business.I would highly recommend this to anyone in sales ... no matter what your level of expertise or tenure."
2,Save your money,"I was excited to try this plan, but the facts and ""plan"" in this book are very basic nutritional knowledge. Work hard, eat right. Maybe I was looking for magic pill, but the writing is sub-par, at best. I felt I was being talked down to, all the way through. There are several inspirational snippets, but they are weighed down by the overall tone that implies the reader can't tell the difference between a corn chip and a carrot. Not the worst book on weight loss, but if you spend 5 minutes on the internet, you can read it all for free."
5,Look Awsome,I ordered these hoping they would go with the gold comforter I bought. I bought the gold drapes of course. THEY ARE AWSOME. Price was great also. The sheer part is a little darker than what is shown but it adds to it not takes away. Gives a beautiful contrast.
1,disgusting,"I think the cover is offensive and with very bad taste, In all Armed Forces are cases of homosexuality, but to focus mainly on that subject in my opinion is partial, and not fair for mostly of the legionnaires or anciens,and of course for a great and respected Armed Force as the Legion Etrangere is. I feel that the book is morbid."
1,It Can Burn the house down,"I purchased this heater and one day - thankfully while I was near it - it started to hiss and spew out smoke, lots of black smoke, burning the innards and generating the awful smell of burning wires. Geez. This is not a safe heater as it could have burned down my house if I wasn't sitting in the room watching it meltdown."
4,Decent bag,Bought this to use on top of my tail bag for added capacity. Well made with decent capacity. Added plus - it has a rain hood that stores in a zippered compartment on the backside of the bag that can be deployed quickly.
2,Barren Terrain,"""The battle for the mind of Ronald Reagan was like the trench warfare of World War I: never have so many fought so hard for such barren terrain.""ATTRIBUTION: Peggy Noonan (b. 1950), U.S. author, presidential speechwriter. 'What I Saw at the Revolution,' ch. 14 (1990).Noonan worked as a special assistant and speechwriter to Reagan, 1984-1988."
4,When Character was King: A story of Ronald Reagan,"Book arrived in very good condition considering it was 2nd hand. Very good value for money. Packaging was very secure to reduce risk of damage.Book itself is excellent, really enjoyable read. And yes Peggy Noonan is a huge fan of Reagan, so in many ways it lacks perhaps objectivity. However if like me you are also a fan of Reagan, his policies, his achievements and the stance he took on issues in what was a very troubling era, than you will not be dissappointed.Great read and I would recommend it to anyone."
5,"Ah, yes...that forgotten American trait...Character...","Ronald Reagan was one of the GREAT presidents EVER! Still, I don't always agree with Peggy Noonan on issues. Her column and her appearances on Television in which she is encouraged to give her opinion makes her much of the time lacking.What Peggy's real talent is, however, is that she has the most amazing way with words. No one in modern times has been able to write so eloquently and so clearly adept. That is what makes this book a must read. The subject matter is easy. Ronald Reagan was wonderful. Peggy captures that fact in a way that no one else can!"
1,Pay no attention to the man behind the curtain...,"Character? This is the fellow who claimed ""he"" was there when ""we"" liberated Auschwitz.... Hagiography of an ignorant, ahistorical waste of carbon."
1,The Best Fantasy Book I Have Ever Read,This book is complete fantasy. The writer trys to gloss over or omit any wrong doing on the part of the monster reagan.Check out Reagan's America by Lloyd Demause or Blinded by the Right
5,Required Reading,"It doesn't take much for me to sum up this book. It should be required reading for all students.The insights about the character of Ronald Reagan brought on through his life's many challanges, is a lesson we can all learn from.There is no better person to tell this story then Peggy Noonan. Bravo Peggy!"
3,It's OK for the price,"This backpack is not the best of the world but it's Ok for the price. My recommendation is ""don't carry much weight on it"". Try to use just for the laptop."
3,"Don't let the ""List Price"" fool you","These labels are 300 per roll, and list at $12.99 from Brother. Consider the seller's ethics in claiming otherwise"
5,"Amazing, and Fits into any schedule","My job requires that I work a great deal of overtime, which leaves little to no time for going to work out at the gym 4-5 times/week. I began doing Body Flex each morning before leaving for work, and quickly learned that it is AMAZING. Not only has it toned me up and slimmed me down to my ideal weight as promised, but with it, I've been able to maintain my figure without any problem for the past 2 years. The 15 minutes necessary to do it each morning is more than worth the time and effort, and I would highly recommend this program to anyone."
1,extremely disappointed,"I purchased this antenna because it was recommended to work with the Hawking usb wireless adapter HWUG1. The wireless adapters performance was disappointing and when this antenna was connected the signal dropped another 15%. I found it to be completely useless. When I contacted Hawking to by email, they ignored me. I will not buy another product from this company."
1,no instruction at all!,"I am disappointed with the cardio section of this workout. I have done her Pilates video and enjoyed it, but on this one, she doesn't explain the dance steps. She calls the name of the steps and gets right into them. Other videos with other instructors either do the step slowly first or they explain it at the beginning of the video.For someone with little to no dance experience, the box step, mambo, sashay step, and others will be hard to follow. I've done the DVD twice and still can't get it right. I just jumped around while they did the steps. She doesn't give good cues as to what is next.Also, the band broke the second time I used the video! I bought a set of 3 bands at another store (for the same price as one of Denise's bands), but they are not long enough to do the toning exercises properly."
4,"Inventive, modern Irish instrumental music","This is a dazzling, consistently inventive all-instrumental Celtic set, branching off from the well-trod paths of traditional jigs and reels, but not so far as to alienate old fans or invite cries of ""foul"" from the anti-crossover contingent. Fans of instrumental trad music will want to check this out."
4,I like it,I like this course but I don't know yet how successful I'll be - just got started. I like the easy way the course is presented and the fact that the book allows you to practice anywhere when you can't look at the DVD.
4,Interesting but very hard...,"this dvd is very helpful for anyone who wants to improve her technic in belly dance. But i think, the exercises are a bit difficult and not accessible to .anyone."
5,THIS IS CRYSTAL'S BEST CD!!!,"Ohmygosh!!! When I put in the CD, i thought it was gonna be one of those boring ones so I layed down. When ""More"" began pouring out of my speakers, I got up and danced. FYI:""MORE"" is now one of my favorite songs!!! I never knew Crystal could sound this awesome!!! Whenever I listen to the CD i make sure that I at least rock my head to the beat. The re-mixes were also great. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK CRYSTAL!!!"
4,cook book,This collection has many recipes that sound very good. It comes in a nice slide container for your shelf. Would make a nice gift for a friend that likes to cook.
3,Em,"I love Paula, and her cooking is truly rich and full of southern charm. However if you are concerned with calories or fat content, you may wish to choose another cookbook from a different cook. The true drawback of this book is the packaging and delivery. When I received it the box was open and caved in a bit on the side. As I opened the box further, the binding of the books were both completely crushed. Considering the books have spiral plastic bindings, it makes for using the books properly very difficult. The pages fall out and you have to re thread them after each use. The recipes are amazing and not as difficult as you may think. It's a great addition to any cook's bookshelf. But you might want to buy this in person from the bookstore to ensure the quality of the book is intact when you get it home."
4,Family Love These Recipes,I have prepared many of the dishes in these books. My family is thrilled with the new dishes. I would love to try more of Paula's cook books.
2,Disappointment,"America has been waiting for a book that offers a balanced assessment of postwar suburbs, a book that offers a closely-reasoned and clear-eyed argument that does justice both to the complexity of the suburbs themselves and to the complexity of the various critiques of the suburbs, a book that avoids obvious logical fallacies and refrains from fighting stereotypes with stereotypes.America will have to keep waiting. This is not that book."
2,Talk about a rush job!,"Being a huge fan of this series, I was excited to hear about a new collection.I immediately ran to the store to grab a copy,but upon picking it up I noticed right away there was only 10 songs!I'm sure we all remember 18 on the last.This is a very dissapointing collection.Half are great,three are ok, and there is two that are horrible.Save your money kiddies and find it used! Lets just hope Volume 4 will be better because lets face it,It can't be worse."
1,Inexpensive but still not worth the price,"I was filling in the holes in my NOW! collection and got this in the mail with no case, no cover booklet, a mangled track listing and the the disc obviously ripped out of a page in the CD binder it was stored in. Pathetic!!!"
4,i needed more,"i brought this cd for my sister who is in love with bsb. she didnt like it, she said it had too many songs that she hasent heard before. i totally agree. even though i got used to those songs and i like them now i didnt know them before and all the songs were supposed to be hits. those werent."
1,"Now 3, an album series on the downward trend","I purchased the original NOW album when it came out and really enjoyed it, then when NOW-2 came out I purchased it also and was a bit disapointed that it didn't seem to measure up the the 1st album. I just purchased NOW-3 and firmly believe that I wasted my money on this album, it seems that they just threw any song into the album without thinking. If you are looking for a really enjoyable album that gives you the popular hits, I suggest buying ""TOTALLY HITS"", now that is a good album."
4,Cool CD with lots of great tunes.,"If you're the kind of person who likes pop tunes, then this CD is definitely a ust-buy. It's the third in a series of albums that are a mixture of recent chart-topping songs. It contains great pop songs like ""All Star"" by Smash Mouth, ""Sometimes"" by Britney Spears and ""All I Have to Give"" by the Basckstreet Boys. It also has hip-hop songs like ""Happily Ever After"" by Case and ""Chante's Got A Man"" by Chante Moore. Also included are rap songs like ""Nookie"" by Limp Bizkit and ""The Rockafeller Skank"" by Fatboy Slim. That's why this CD is good for just about anyone. It has such a mixture that there will definitely be something on it you'll like."
5,STRONG LITTLE MACHINE....,"I am happy with my Dirt Devil and am impressed with its pick up ability.It is very easy to clean out (just spill the dirt contents into the garbage) because all the dirt is conveniently distributed into an extra large cup that very simply detaches and reattaches to the mechanism.The wire is extra long so you are able to vacuum two adjacent rooms without unplugging - always a time saver.The only slight 'criticism' I have for this machine is where the company choose to place wire. Because the wire is fastened to the machine at the base, it is necessary to hold the wire up with one hand as you vacuum with the other (otherwise the wire gets in the way of vacuuming). This is a very minor inconvenience, and I wouldn't let this be a determining factor in whether one purchases this item or not.Hope this feedback is helpful to anyone interested in purchasing this item."
4,Handy for Small Size Spaces,"We got this for our summer cottage and here are the pluses and minuses:+ small size works fine for small rooms, under chairs, into corners+ handle slides down for compact storage+ no bags to buy, clear canister easy to remove and empty+ no accessories to clutter up the place+ long cord, plug into a central location & vacuum the whole place- hard to push on carpet, really have to put some strength into shoving it- won't vacuum throw rugs, eats them up (just shake them outside instead)- pretty noisy, but tolerable for a small time for small space- no adjustment level for carpet or bare floors"
3,"cheap, ok value, noisy","I'm moderately satisfied with this DirtDevil. I suppose for an apartment sized similar to mine (950 sqft with 2 carpeted bedrooms), it works fine, but for a house you'll need something more robust. I never had a problem with it, but it doesn't come with a detachable hose, so it's not very convenient for corners or areas under the bed/couch/table. Plus it's incredibly noisy. But then again, it's cheap, so if price is important and you're not into hardcore cleaning, this works fine."
2,Mr. Sanford's book is very disappointing,"Very disappointing. Costs much more than the book is worth. It is 149 pages of large print and many pictures. There is too much about the author's life and not enough about Mr. MacArthur.The section about MacArthur's rise to wealth adds nothing to an earlier book about MacArthur called ""The Stockholder"". The information in both books is sketchy and incomplete.There is almost nothing about MacArthur's wives or children.I think that the information about MacArthur's cause of death is incorrect. The author cites pancreatic cancer but I think it was lung cancer which killed MacArthur.No one to-date has written a thorough biography of the life of this fascinating man."
2,It's just a toy,"very durable toy, not really fun, just spins and rides. The doll doesn't sit well on it. No educational value at all. It still runs but kids no longer play with it."
3,Probably of interest to hard-core P-funk or Hendrix fans,"This CD contains what the title implies, namely various songs inspired by Hendrix and his style by assorted P-Funk guitar players and associates, past and present, such as Eddie Hazel, Michael Hampton, Blackbyrd (sp?), etc. The quality of the tunes and playing ranges from middling to inspired, but the CD as a whole is probably of interest only to hard-core P-Funk and/or Hendrix fans. There is little, if any, actual Hendrix, sampled or otherwise, on this CD. Also, there is some commentary by George Clinton that, regardless of one's opinion of Public Enemy, I personally put a good deal of stock in, considering the source. THINK! It ain't illegal yet!"
2,feel sorry for leo,this is a performer with great talent at the bottom of his career. its makes me feel sorry for him to have to perform in such a place with those types of people there. drunken bar trash and he is looking like a down and out has been. a poor nightclub act that is not helped by the poor quality of the video and audio. only buy this dvd if you want to feel ripped off.
1,No Response From Global Star ever!,"I LOVED the original Moraff's Maximum Mahjongg. In fact I loved it so much I recommended it to anyone and everyone!! When this one came out I bought it thinking this would be great. Well I was incredibly disappointed. The game would not work on my system, no matter what I tried. I uninstalled and reinstalled it. I even exchanged it, thinking maybe it was the cd-rom that was not working. I could only get into one game. I could never get into any of the options, tile selections, etc. So I went to the Global Star's website to see if there were any patches available. No patches, but there was a contact support form. I filled out the form and got an error message that the form didn't function. So I wrote an email to the email addy listed and never got a response. I wrote them a couple of times and still no response. So basically I have a ... coaster."
1,not what it says,"this collection only has the playmate of the year from each year (6 girls total)not each playmate of the month like it leads you to believe thats another dvd collection not this one ,don't be fooled"
2,Pretty good effort from a pretty scary flick !,"This little film has some very cool moments about anti-bullying and romance.The special effects are really well done and consistent to deterioration of the flesh.There was even some little touches of true friendship and how that can even bridge the gap of those dying and those undead.OK,Lots of drinking,drugs and Rock & Roll to please those grunge loving party animals ,""Who just wanna get their drunk on and watch a wild ride of a dvd."
3,Great Low Budget Effort,"I agree with the quote on the box. ""Melvin rocks. Why aren't all horror movies this fun?"" This offbeat quirky film sets a tone of its own. Great zombie makeup and sounds...lots of silly blood and gore...and the rye and dry humor tempers this as a fun film...nothing more. Kudos to director/writer Henry Weintraub and special effects coordinator Jeremy Garner."
2,Nice work scary movie peoples !!!,"This little film has some very cool moments about anti-bullying and romance.The special effects are really well done and consistent to deterioration of the flesh.There was even some little touches of true friendship and how that can even bridge the gap of those dying and those undead.OK,Lots of drinking,drugs and Rock & Roll to please those grunge loving party animals ,""Who just wanna get their drunk on and watch a wild ride of a dvd."
2,the begining of greatness,"I was eagerly awaiting for this comic,since I m big fan of Alex Ross and the movie ""Terminator 2"",so a combination of 2 of my favourite topics would be great.It was a mixed feeling of sorts,happy to see the work of an ""upcoming artist"",but kind of let down by his earlier work as compared to his ""legendary"" works in ""Marvels"" and ""Justice"""
5,This DVD is just wonderful,"I don't actually have the first Combination Nation but volume two is terrific. The combos are the perfect length, nothing too hard, I would call this the perfect DVD for intermediate belly dancers.There is a real lack of combinations and choreography in the belly dance DVD marketplace and Combination Nation is just perfect for dancers looking to perform the moves they've already learned. There are so many beginners DVDs but this DVD shows you how to use those skills and put together short choreographies. I definitely recommend this DVD for anyone that's beyond the beginning stages of belly dance.My faves were Oreet, Aradia, and Sa'diyya - just in case you were wondering. :)"
3,this one is cheaper,"Compared to the other labels from other printers, this one is cheaper on per-label. So far, we haven't had any label mis-feed or labels getting caught in the printer. That is over 3 years of usage in a busy medical office, going through about 2-3 boxes of labels per month."
2,Bad shipping and not stable,"When I received the shipment the flanges on most of the pieces were bent. I bent them flat and assembled the unit. For a top I used 1 1/8 plywood. My main problem is that the finished table wobbles and flexes. The problem is in the way the braces bolt to the legs. The threaded inserts in the legs stand proud of the surface of the legs. This allows the flanges on the braces to flex. I got this because I thought, with that much steel, it would be solid as a rock. Once again the Chinese imports have found a way to disappoint."
1,"Bad Grizzly, bad!","Like others I recieved my bench base damaged. The packing is horrible still after all the complaints I'm sure the company has recieved. The flanges that connect the base to the top were bent and not even welded square or perpendicular to the legs. The factory drilled holes on the stretchers do not line up resulting in the bench being out of wack and racking. I have bit the bullet and sold it for a hit on c-list as I did not want to deal with returning it. I will build my own base to ensure it is correct. This base would be okay for someone that doesn't need a perfect bench. I am a fine woodworker and need something that is dead on accurate and does not rack or move. I would expect this from a company like Shop Fox i.e. Grizzly. Given the business the company is in, and the product I recieved is the reason for the low rating. If I could give it Zero stars I would. POOR product period. Save your money."
3,"Great Product, Terrible Shipping","I recieved the boxes like the other said from UPS freight all beat up. The flanges on the main support legs were bent but were easy to straighten. Grizzly needs to learn how to pack things. I ordered a 1 3/4"" maple top ( 30"" X 60"") from Rand and the maple top is beautiful on both sides and flat as a sheet of glass unlike the ones sold by grizzly.Dale"
3,I've been looking for this title,"wow! Talk about a blast from the past!I've been looking for these books for awhile now - my mom had given them to me back in the 70s, and I thought she had kept them for whenever I got around to having kids...she didn't. But I do remember these books being something I used as my own reference a whole lot during my early teen years, and I think my son will benefit from them as well.So glad I found this!"
2,pay a little extra for some better ones,"I bought 5 of these and as the other reviewer pointed out they are bad for slipping. 2 of mine are slipping. i will say this the 3/4 of this type seems to be better, i have three of them and none are slipping. but for a few dollars more don't take a chance."
2,Boring and dull. Dull and boring.,"I found this book to be flat, dull and boring and the authour to be rather self-congratulatory. The author travels from one small Sicilian town to another trying to ... do what? I dunno. I read every word, and she didn't have much to say about Sicily or her people except that she likes them. She really likes them!As the series of vignettes progressed, it became difficult to follow any kind of time line. What happened when and with whom? Dunno. I am still unclear on how this book of little stories was organized, if indeed it was.Finally, I don't know that I gleaned anything from the book except that the author really likes Sicily and she's really glad that she got to live there and she's really lucky that anyone would publish her book."
4,A Deeper Look,"I read this book because I am going to Sicily for the first time this winter. My delight in learning about many villages I would otherwise not visit was heightened by thestory of this woman's journies . Her quest was different from my own -- she wanted to experience a world that spoke to her origins as a descendant of Sicilians. It was not agreat book, but interesting enough ."
4,She describes it so well...,"She shares the feelings and experiences of meeting the people and places of Sicily. Wonderful!! By combining the stories of her experiences with the history of the towns, she conveys the magnetism that pulls so many of us back to that island again and again. My only regret is that she doesn't include some of the photos she describes so well."
3,Escapist movie,A movie good to get an escape from the modern world and to get a good laugh at how they interpreted history. Ronald Reagan as George Armstrong Custer?? This movie is not for historical purists
1,Horrible product,"Imagine my surprise the first time I washed this and it fell apart! Each individual ""leaf"" comes off very easily. Worst $20 I've spent on anything."
2,Not What I Expected,"After 189 pages I just couldn't take it anymore. I've read everything I can get my hands on that can about hiking the AT but I couldn't finish this book because I got so tired of the constant boozing, misogynistic behavior and self-absorbed monologues. The author is nearing 40 but sounds like a college student. His negativity - constantly putting down the people he meets along the way (except for the bedable women) and making gross generalizations about folks on and off the trail - was grating and disturbing. I don't really get why this book got such high marks for the writing. I found his thoughts disorganized and unfinished, fragmented and, at times reading like ""brain salad"" rants.But it looks like lots of other folks like the book, so there must be a market for this stuff."
5,Sonicflood,"Pues a mi si me gustó el cd, aunque es otro tipo de sonido pero esta bien...Resonate, Dear Lord....las que mas me gustan, pero de hecho todo el cd está bueno:D!"
4,Wonderful album,Let all nature sing - let the earth rejoice - we will resonate your glory - let all living things praise you with one voice - we will resonate your glory. WOW I love it.
1,nothing stands out,I read some of the review and thought for the low used price Why not. Let me tell you why not. Nothing stands out. This is also a general critic of Contempory Christian music. Mediocracy is the theme of most music. I listened to this CD twice and thought everything sounded the same. GOD forgive me but for praise to our LORD my standards are much higher.
4,Jet 709180 1/2-Inch Three Point Tool Multi-Purpose Tool,"Jet 709180 1/2-Inch Three Point Tool Multi-Purpose ToolStill figuring out everything it can be used for. It does amazingly well on small beads and Vs. Kind of a cross between a skew and a scraper.Haven't needed to sharpen it, except a few strokes with a diamond hone to touch it up. No idea on grinding it as faces are flat."
3,Depraved,"To my mind, this book was terribly disjoined and jumped around so much it was difficult to follow. An intriguing story, but would like to know more about this man BEFORE Chicago and AFTER conviction. Well written, but bogged down in detail an awful lot."
4,"Interesting Tale of Serial Killing in the ""Good Old Days""","""Depraved"" tells the story of the first serial killer in American history, Herman Mudgett. Mudgett, through cunning and sadistic genius, murdered perhaps as many as 200 people in his customized ""murder castle"" (an exact number of victims isn't know since Mudgett lied through his teeth about most everything). The macabre castle had air-tight, soundproof rooms in which to kill victims and also had a crematorium in which to dispose of bodies. This story could be taken from the headlines of today but was not. It happened over a century ago. Definately worth the time of true-crime readers."
1,Unfair business practices,"On Friday 20 Nov 2012 I ordered this front page featured ""Fiesta 12-ounce Java Mug, Pack of 12"" set from Amazon.com for 88% off the list price of $118.94. I received exactly ONE SINGLE MUG for the Black Friday Special of $14.35.This is the first complaint I've had with Amazon.com business practices after perhaps 8 or 9 years of service.Amazon.com appears to offer only a return. There is no way to communicate that what I ordered was not received."
3,"Okay, but Not Spectacular","I bought this mug to keep at my desk at work (my office only has paper cups) and it is fine for my needs, though I would not purchase it again. I got the plum color, which I love, but there are several (about 7 - 8) minor blemishes in the glaze: white dots and little scratches. The handle is big enough to easily get three fingers through, but the walls of the mug are thin and do not insulate the coffee well. If I want hot coffee, I have to drink it quickly.Overall, this mug is okay, but nothing about it blows me away, especially for $13. You're definitely paying for the Fiesta name, which used to mean quality; now it only seems to mean an expensive, mediocre product with a flawed appearance."
5,Building a simpler life,"This is a great book of building dreams and manifesting your own destiny. As I read I was brought out into the hot sun, crying, sweating and blistering along with the builder. It has never ceased to amaze me what human beings can bring about if they really put their mind to it. Carolyn Roberts is truly a warrior of life and creates a reality we can all live with. Keeping life simple allows one to focus on realizing one's dreams. And Carolyn's dream is one of giving. Giving back to Mother Earth and giving us a good example of how simple, healthy, loving life can be.If you are interested in building a house, especially one of straw, this is a must read. It prepares you for the pitfalls and the joys of accomplishing challenges you never thought you could."
2,"MANY errors, sloppy piece of work!","Although the authors appear qualified to fly IFR (both rated instrument pilots), it also appears that they wrote the book while flying IFR. In other words, this book is VERY sloppy, with many pictures in the wrong place, errors in the text, problems with their formulas, etc. Despite these facts, it's the only game in town for MSFS '98 for now. I hope they clean up what could be a great book in their next addition---better yet, I hope Richard Collins writes an IFR tutorial for MSFS '98."
1,Crawly things in the raisins,"I had to throw out almost all of these raisins because they contained crawly things and/or what looks like the droppings of crawly things. I must say I generally love Newman's products, and I was willing to give these raisins the benefit of the doubt. With natural products, sometimes bugs get in them. That's part of the territory with organic matter. But I found white grubs and little brown dots that weren't a part of the raisins in box after shrink-wrapped box. Some boxes were fine, and I ate the raisins in them, but the majority were tainted. I'll need to be assured there's been an improvement in quality control before I try Newman's snack-pack organic raisins again."
1,No.,"This is a very good guidebook. And it is truly a shame that it is not a _Linux_ guidebook. It is, as others have noted, a Gnome guidebook(the GUI for Redhat 6). It is a very /good/ Gnome guidebook, and if there are people mind-bogglingly stupid enough to need guidebooks for Macs & Windows, then I suppose there are people who need guidebooks for Gnome. This book tells you nothing of the text-structured Linux that we in the technophile community have come to know & love, and though it may get you going, won't get you anywhere good."
1,"Not nearly what ""On Aging"" was","I have given ""On Aging"" to a dozen people,and made it mandatory reading in the department that I manage. Saw this one on the shelf at the bookstore and couldn't wait! Well, it's not nearly what ""On Aging"" is. Was he in a hurry to get something in print? Sorry, I still love the man, but this just isn't up to his standards."
5,Great Text,As I said before when you asked me to review this book I still say that this is not a book for kids but for the serious student. The delivery was on time and the book was brand new and I am using it for post graduate work in Seminary.
3,A Worthy Study on the Apostle Paul,"This is a worthy study on the fourth most important man of Christianity...Paul, former Pharisee, cheif of sinners and apostle to the Gentiles. The book abounds in historical references and notes. Paul is certianly a manof his time. Bruce covers Paul's life from the fragments of quotes on his childhood..on through tohis end. Interspersed is chapters that Bruce provides additional insights like ""Paul and the Historical Jesus"",""Flesh and Spirit"" , ""Baptism and the Lord's Supper in Pauline Thought"", also ""Paul and the Life to Come.""The weakness of the book is the frequent quotes from liberal scholars..like Karl Barth and others. Their arguements have no validity since their ""higher criticism"" deny the supernatural working of God in the life of Paul. Another weakness is that Bruce is of the Covenant Theology view...which tendsto mix God's purpose for Israel with His purpose for the Church.But the strengths over come these weaknesses."
2,"A fun show, but a word of caution.","I like this show however, a word of caution. Some of the subject matter of this show is a bit racy for younger children. There is mention of adult subject matter in the series. ( birth control, sex, dating, ) if I would have known this, I probably wouldn't have ordered it."
2,This movie had the potential to be so much more than it was.,"When I started watching this movie, I thought that it was going to be excellent eye candy, if nothing else. The Latina girls are all so gorgeous. But, as I watch the movie, everything that could kill a movie's appeal was happening one after another, and then so on and so on, and it just ended up being an outright miserable disaster.The three bad things about this movie:The editing, the soundtrack music, and the unappealing gangland attitude.The three good things about this film:The beautiful girls, the three main girls of this film. They were all so beautiful.But the story, though it had good potential, was just ruined by having a terrible director, writer, and cutting editor.I hope this movie didn't destroy the careers of the three beautiful girls in this movie."
5,Wonderful,"This set is wonderful, but the quality of Middlemarch is terrible (a doublesided disk). I have Middlemarch as PAL in the UK version, and the quality is very much better (16 Euros from holland)."
1,malfuction,"I recieved this DVD, did not watch it until three days after arriving. Middlemarch is not recorded correctly, it skipps two chapters and plays two chapters twice. I can not even return it because I had to play it find it was NOT PROPERLY RECORDED. This is a great story, it is so sad that it does not work, and worse that I am stuck with it."
3,Disappointed,"Having Read all the reviews prior to purchasing this set I was very excited to receive it and started watching the movies right away. Wow was I disappointed. Maybe I am just used to a different style of period dramas, but mostly I was bored to tears while watching these. I am also going to have to agree with the reviewer who said the men were moronic. No I hadn't read any of these books before I bought the set, I did so merely on the reviews I read. I will say that I didn't fall completely asleep during Middlemarch. So here's my suggestion. If you are a huge George Eliot fan and have read the books you will probably love this set and I hope you do. Otherwise I wouldn't suggest this outdated, bad acting box of snoresville! Mine is going to charity!"
1,Waste of money,"All (no exceptions) of the movies in the collection were boring and just plain awful. I wish I could give it -10 stars. The acting in all of the movies was amateurish and reminded me of the ""live"" plays in black and white on TV in the '50s that were horrible. In addition, there should have been closed captioning because I couldn't understand half of what the actors were saying. The sets were cheaply put together and it showed. In one of the movies (I can't remember which one), there was a scene where a young man was at school taking a lesson from a fencing master and it was obvious that they learned the moves like dance steps and were counting how many times they were suppose to engage the swords. I laughed and laughed. If you are considering purchasing this collection, one word - DON'T. It's a waste of money."
5,Beautiful,"It's not often that this word is used to describe music by a prog band. But Clutching At Straws (CAS) is all of this and more.Fish's mastery of the lyrical genius is truly beautiful in this album. It is worth buying alone for the concept trio of ""Hotel Hobbies, Warm Wet Circles & That Time of the Night"", which i defy you not to sing over and over after hearing them! They are reflective and dark in tone and the perfect counterpoint to the lighter ""Incommunicado"" and the sharp ""White Russian"".""Sugar Mice"" is a wonderfully deep track with a haunting melody, and ""Torch song"" is a testemony for Fish's uncertainty during this album's conception.If you stumbled here by mistake, or if your only memory of Marillion is Kayleigh, buy this album, and become one of those who know."
4,Prog's last great gasp.,"With the exception of The Flower Kings and Transatlantic, Marillion with Fish at the helm, were perhaps prog's last great band. This their final recording with Fish, is surprisingly not very progressive. In fact, it reminds me more of Who Are You era Who than prog. Incommunicado even mimic's the Who and Fish, Daltrey. It's still quite good but definately more hard rocking than previous efforts, even the punchy Fugazi. It definately sounds like a band facing it's demise as the level of collaboration and interplay present in the three previous studio efforts are missing here. Still worth purchasing however...Simon"
5,Great mystery series,"If you like the Sherlock Holmes series, you may like Poirot. The show also features a lot of Art Deco which I also love."
5,I love mysteries,i love Agatha Christie's murder mysteries. Especially Poirot. I like the fact that i can watch them for free with my prime membership. I wish i could watch Wire in the Blood free but i'll settle for buying the dvds. I love Robson Green as well
5,Poirot,"This is a first rate series of shows. Mr. Poirot is a little strange acting, but the plots and the scenery is the best. Have already recommended to several friends."
4,Lady Day: Best of Billie Holiday,This is a very good collection of songs that Billie Holiday sang during the jazz era of America. It has an old fashioned sound as if it is being played on one of those antiquated phonographs-most of the very young population may not know what this is. I liked and enjoyed listening to this cd-Billie had a mysterious and beatiful voice that sang these songs with conviction.
1,the best of billie holiday,"This is not a good demonstration of Billie Holliday. First, too many songs squeezed into each side. Sound not good. For me, it was a waste of money. One of her best is the Billie Holiday-Lester Young CD "" a musical romance"""
5,Lady Day: The Best of Billie Holiday,Bought this for my granddaughter. She's a Billie Holiday fan. She loved the CD.
3,Coast to Coast Walk,"My husband used this on his walk. It was helpful, but some of the landmarks were evidently gone. And paths a little hard to find. Wainwright's video of the walk was very interesting and fun to watch with him after his walk."
3,cow girl outfit,this has some brown stains on it but we were able to cover some of the spots with sequence. From far away you can not tell
5,Always now and forever,"amo is great. I can listen to is new album over and over again and not get tiard of it. One night stand is one of my faviorate songs, it just put you in a good mood. If you can get a chance to see him live, it a must see.Not only is the music great but he is very entertaining."
5,Lightning Bird,"The Lightning Bird has remained my very favorite book of all times. It captures how very different indeed the African mind and perspective is from our Western one. Beautifully written, this book is a must on African afishionados book shelf."
3,Okay,"This is a pretty good one. Some good Southern recipes, but for some reason, I sorta expected more."
1,I did not even get everything that I ordered!!!,I ordered this for my kids as a fathers day present and when he opened the box there was only the small bottle of Joop. I am very disappointed that I did not get what I ordered!!
2,Probably old bottle - does not last long,I purchased another of this perfume as a gift to my cousin and I know that the one I got from Amazon does not smell as strong and last as long - although this perfume is rated extremely high on longevity and sillage.
4,Super convenient - good expresso,"You are buying convenience here, it does not make great espresso, but good enough for not so picky drinkers that want a quick shot without much work. Very good for a quick latte too. It is very picky on beans, if coffee does not come out like one reviewer mentioned, it is likely that the grind is too fine and you need to set the grinder a notch or two down. eg. I have no problem with Lavazza Top Class at the finest setting, but need to dial back a notch with Lavazza Super Crema because it was clogging. The brewing temperature is not a hot as the S series but still hotter than most other super-auto out there. I would get the the S if not for the aluminum thermoblocks."
1,Don't buy this record if you live in France !,"Wizards is a great movie and I have been wanting to see it again since back in 1977. It left me with warm memories of utter creativity, fun and wonder. I looked for a version that would play in zone 2, but in vain.Then someone told me that maybe blu-ray recordings would be zone-free, but that was a false information.So I bought this product and I cannot play it. Too bad.When are we, french people, going to be allowed to see this picture ?I wonder and keep hoping."
3,"Looks good, not sure how long it will last.",Nice looking piece. Included filter. Top seems a little flimsey so I am not sure how long it will hold up.
1,DON'T BOTHER,"I loved What The Bleep? And I specifically wanted to learn more about 'creating your day'.This video teaches NOTHING about how to create your day - NOTHING.It's just Ramtha (JZ Knight) talking about the fact that you can create your day. I HEARD YOU IN THE MOVIE! I bought this to give me some additional insights into HOW to create my day.It does NOT teach any HOW whatsoever.DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!Buy ""The Secret"" @ TheSecret.tv.Buy ""The Attractor Factor"" by Joe Vitale.Buy ""Wealth Beyond Reason"" by Bob Doyle.DO NOT BUY THIS VIDEO!"
5,Be Here Now,"There are certain people who are READY to SEE.THIS DVD IS FOR YOU.If you are aware that you are locked into the trance of your own thoughtforms and that you indeed create your own experience of reality, this talk from RAMTHA is a mind jolt and will assist you in becoming awake.RAMTHA is a rarity in the illusionary maze of spiritual teachings.Truly a breath of fresh air.I would recommend her/his other dvd/s also as an adjunt to this one.GO ON.... CONSCIOUSLY CREATE YOUR DAY.LOVE DON, UK**********"
3,Create your day,"The video was somewhat interesting. I was more taken by the remarks in the video ""What the Bleep"" and was hoping for more in depth information and specific instructions, which you quite never quite get. I had to keep reminding myself I am listening to the words of a channeled, non-physical being, Ramtha, and not JZ Knight. Otherwize she would be coming off as more than a little arrogant. Glad I saw it though."
3,"It is a good work out, but","I enjoyed this video, but I feel like they go through it a little to quickly, if you don't have time to learn the moves properly, then they are not going to serve the right purpose. I am sure that if I practice it more, I would get it down better, but I really don't have the patience, it is much better than some spastic aerobic workouts but still not slow enough on the explaining."
4,Great for any fitness level,"I really wanted to buy a kickboxing video that would not be too complicated. As a user of other Kathy Smith videos, I decided to purchased this one. The moves are fairly simple and you can get a good workout. Unlike a lot of Kathy's other videos, there are no modifications for lower or higher intensity, but since it is not a standard floor aerobics video, it really isn't necessary to do so. If you are looking for something different to add to your routine, this is a good choice."
3,Not for someone looking for proper form,This is a good workout video if you are not worried about your form suffering. High impact good music... Better than Tae Bo. I watched a demo of the video (just google it) that is what made me decide to purchase. I am not able to get to my traditional Thai boxing classes and needed something in between. Good for a workout!
5,A great workout!,"Thumbs up to this video! I also own the 4 tape collection of Tae Bo and I wouldn't have purchased them if I had this tape first! I think this tape is as fun, if not funner than Tae Bo. It is just as challenging as well, once you know the moves well enough to work them.The moves vary enough that it can be combined with Tae Bo for a variety of kickboxing training. The warm-up and cool down is also fun!This tape is much better than her Aerobox(she doesn't instruct this one, just participates)."
1,"Good for training, not for cardio","I'm really surprised and disappointed that so many people gave this video high marks, especially since I bought the video based on those reviews. I rarely contribute comments on videos, but after doing this video for the first time today I was so disappointed I have to comment. It is a great instructional video for the beginner who has never done a kickboxing workout before. But if you are looking for a cardio workout, this is not it. Kathy takes so much time to teach and build up all the components of a move. Then when you finally do the complete move, the number of reps are very low, and you are back to training for the next move. I barely broke a sweat. If you are looking for a great cardio kickboxing workout, buy Power Kicks (Aaron Langford). I'm desperately searching for another great kickboxing video to have some variety, but with Kathy's video I'm disappointed yet again."
4,Kickboxing Workout,"It was fun!!! I didn't particularly care for the music, but that goes for most workout videos I've done."
3,Ehh....,"This tape is all right for someone who does aerobics tapes and wants to try kickboxing. If you've done kickboxing before, (I've done Tae Bo, Power Kicks, and a kickboxing class with a black belt) it's pretty low key by comparison. After doing the real thing, this just doesn't cut it. I like Kathy's walking tapes, but this tape left me lukewarm about the whole kickboxing thing, and I love kickboxing. I recommend buying Aaron Lankford's Power Kicks, Tae Bo, or even Cory Everson's Kardio Kick over this one. If you're not familiar with kickboxing, Chuck Norris' Private Lessons is also very good (although it's designed as a self defense instruction, so there's some mention of doing bodily harm to attackers). It's approximately 50 minutes of instruction, followed by a 20 minute routine. The form is generally decent on this tape, but the atmosphere is definitely more of an aerobics class, and not a kickboxing class."
2,WTF,I went on their website and the the 25 count co2 12g cartridges are $16.99 and why are these are $19.60 what is wrong with you CROSMAN WHY ARE YOU TRYING TO RIP ALL OF US OFF CHANGE THE GODDAMN PRICE BACK TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE!!!!!!
1,You Will Be Shipped Inferior Cartridges! Please Beware!,"they claim to be Crosman Brand cartridges, but what you will get is off-brand cheap cartridges. I am very familiar with CO2 Cartridges and I can tell you straight out that all Crosman produced Cartridges will say ""Crosman"" on the side. It'll take many compliant apparenty to shut the seller down.the fact is that every time they doop someone they have committed a scam, and in most places in the word scams are illegal. I just wish someone would do some thing about it.hope this info helps you out :-)"
5,The Cool Tenor of Scott Hamilton,"Scott Hamilton is a very accomplished tenor saxophonist in the mold of Zoot Sims - which is high praise indeed. This is a collection of laid-back tracks culled from a decade or more of his rather prolific releases. These ballads work as more than just mood music - the cool jazz of these combos is quite enjoyable to appreciate the musicianship and listen to actively. But if you're looking for background music to a sexy evening in your bachelor's pad, this works well."
3,A thriller,"I read this book in 1980 after reading about this daring raid at Entebbe,Uganda in a book titled 'Moassad- Israel's secret service'. I don't remember much of the details except that reading this book was like watching a movie(perhaps even more than that!). My interest in this book stems from the fact that it is the fourth day of hijacking of Indian Airlines by suspected militants(the plane right now is in Kandhakar, Afganistan after its ordeal at Amritsar, Lahore and Dubai). Details in this book perhaps might be a lesson to the powers that be in India."
1,Don't waste your time,"I bought this because I'm a Python fan and enjoy documentaries and historical accounts. But this product is very disappointing. Firstly the picture quality isn't great. Secondly it's very amateurishly done: The interviews are done in grungy surroundings that are irrelevant to the subject. The host is sitting in front of rock band equipment, and the interviews are done in dark rooms. It's very unprofessional. Thirdly, the footage excerpts go for too long... anyone who buys this will be a Python fan, so they don't need or want to see a lot of material they already know or have. Fourthly, there's nothing new here. I didn't learn one thing that I didn't already know. I'll be selling this on eBay. I just don't want it, and I love Python."
5,Excellent!,"I just love this machine. Excuse the typing mistakes because I am totally buzzed on 5 shots of espresso! Now, to qualify, I used to have a top-of-the line Rancilio in a gift shop that I used to own. When I sold the shop there went the Rancilio and also my favorite custom lattes! After a year of putzing around I finally broke down and started researching home machines. While I couldn't justify the price of the Sylvia, I decided to go with this one. I am so glad I did! Excellent shots, amazing frothing capabilities. I'm back in the saddle now!"
2,Fun Disney Game Terrible Tetris Game,I`ve played almost all verisons of Tetris and this is deferentially the worst it gives you 5 L blaocks in a row and wont give you more for like 100 more other crappy blocks. Little kids will like the disney`ness of it
4,It's an alright game for a resident evil series.,"I played the second resident evil when it came out on nintendo64. And I must admit, Resident Evil 2 is hands on more brilliant than Resident Evil 3. Nemesis is a cool character, but basically it get's borring after a while. It does follow a similiar story line and it seems the creatures always stay the same. The downside of having Resident Evil 3 was the fact that it kind of tore me away from the series. Although the second resident evil game was awesome, Resident Evil 3, couldn't pull off on the graphics. The music was good however, and it did have a good sound to it. It just needs a different story line and a more complex one. I must say, if this is your first time playing Resident Evil play the second game before you play this game. The second game is by far better through it's graphics, story line, and characters. Overall, this game would be good for a addon for someone who collects resident evil games. I, myself, didn't care to much for the game."
3,it's okay,the game is pretty fun and the stroyline is pretty good....however it is very short...I beat the entire game in less than anhour
1,Are you kidding me??? Just a GAME?,"No, this is not just a game. This ""game"" kills cops. Yes, it is supposed to be ""just for adults"". Kids still get these games. Plus, I don't care if it's kids or adults playing. Adults kill cops just like kids.I am a proud wife of a police officer that I kiss goodbye every morning and hope he comes home at 5. Please remember before purchasing that everytime a police officer dies.. he/she was protecting you and he/she has a family that was left behind."
1,parts missing,when shipment arrived there was no glass for inside the fixture. So I had to have glass cut at the local hardware store before installing the light fixture.
5,good value !!,for the price you cant go wrong- we bought three for our shop and they all come quickly and they take about 2 min to install (Max)good buy !!
4,Good value,"My 20+ year old plastic paper towel holder recently cracked and I was looking for a sturdy, easy-to-use replacement, so once again I found Amazon's reviews to be immensely helpful. (Who wants to waste time and money putting up something that's a piece of junk, even if it's ""only"" there to dispense towels?) Thank you to the reviewer who mentioned the unusually close spacing of the screws on this holder; it exactly fit the holes from my old holder (5 and 5/8"" apart) and I didn't have to bother with drilling any new holes. Some other holders may be better looking, but this seems like it will be very serviceable and a good value. I ended up finding this item at a chain kitchen/bedding store in my area, so didn't have to wait for it to be shipped, but Amazon came through for me nonetheless."
2,a poor showing for such a talented writer,"I have to say I found this book disappointing. The plot was clunky- neither the mystery nor the romance pulled me in at all. The main characters seemed more like caricatures, the mystery wasn't that mysterious, and there were entirely too many subplots cluttering up the landscape whose only purpose seemed to be laying the groundwork for future novels about these two families.I've always been a huge fan of Garwood's historical novels, and hoped her signature depth and humor would shine through this contemporary story. Unfortunately, all of the elements of a classic Garwood were missing from Slow Burn, and I was left with shallowly drawn characters and a sketchy plot- not enough to carry the book."
3,Slow read...,"I was looking at this book in a bookstore when two women came by and told me how wonderful it was, what a great read it was. So I bought it because I like Garwood's historicals. Well, I could hardly finish the book, I was so bored with it. The writing was choppy and had no flow to it. The characters and their dialogue were dull and frankly, I didn't see where it was such a good read. The only reason I made myself finish it was because I spent $8.00 on it."
1,Pining for the Garwood of Yore,"This book is a stinker. When I compare the artistry, humor, and emotion of Garwood's historicals with this...book...I want to WEEP! Once upon a time, she was my favorite! I re-read her work over and over again. This book, however, has no mystery, no charm, no character development--I could go on, but other reviewers have said it for me. And it's not that I don't like contemporary romantic suspense--they're my favorites!--but Garwood just can't write them. Try a Linda Howard. Try a Catherine Coulter. Try a JD Robb. But leave these new Garwoods on the shelf where they belong. Serious readers should discount all those positive reviews. They could only have been written by Garwood's kids."
1,Don't change what's working so well,"I've been an avid JG reader for years...and then she started writing contemporary. WHY?!?! I've tried to read this new series but I every time I start one of these books, I end up skimming through until I'm at the end and then I don't pick them up again.Her historicals, I have read over and over again and never get bored with them but these contemporary...I just can't seem to get into them.It's not like I don't enjoy contemporary. I eat up Iris Johanson, Nora Roberts (JD Robb), Linda Howard..ect...but Julie Garwood just doesn't pull them off very well. I don't care for the characters and the plots seem so lame.Don't stop what's working for you!"
4,Pretty good,Love Julie Garwood books but I think I'm more of a fan of the historical romance books. I'm kinda sad to say that she doesn't do so well in my option in this book because she did not even let you think or have suspicions about who the real killer or whatever you want to call it. But it was ok
3,Too slow of a burn,"I like this series and think Julie Garwood has created compelling male leads in the Buchanan family. While this is an interesting story, Kate MacKenna is a fairly bland character even though her story would suggest otherwise. Dylan Buchanan is pretty well fleshed out and thank goodness we see a lot of him in the story. It's a good read but not on the level of Heartbreaker and Mercy. I was able to figure out the culprit in the mystery pretty early on but there is a surprising twist to compensate for that. It was worth my time to read and I ultimately enjoyed the book."
2,Wait for the paperback,"I'm a big Julie Garwood and was looking forward to her latest. Slow Burn was disappointing in that there wasn't very much of a romance - the ending scene provided more information than any of the previous scenes about why Dylan and Kate were getting together. The suspense was highly predictable in way none of her previous novels have been. Also, the usual banter and charm of her characters was missing - you never really got to know or like them. I was surprised and bummed. . ."
3,It's ok but could have been better,"Acclaim Sport's release of Attitude revolutionized the way wrestling games look and sound. The WWF Superstars' faces and bodies were scanned with stunng accuracy and detail. Along with visuals, each competitor's theme music and (partial) entrance was added as well. Collision errors and long loading aside, this game is something else. However, the controls were less than responsive. Acclaim used the Mortal Kombat button combos for each set of moves and, to be frank, it was a like Chris Beniot, a pain in the neck."
2,DIFFICULT TO MAKE EXCITING MOVE,"I THINK THIS THE HORRIBLE GAME EVERIN WWF I THINK WWF SMACKDOWN 1,2 IS MORE ROCKS!BECAUSE WWF ATTITUDE GAME IS TO DIFFICULTTO MAKE SPECIAL MOVE AN EXAMPLE:STUNNER,PEDEGREE,CHOKESLAM,THE PEOPLE ELBOW I HATE THIS GAME!!!IT'S TRUE."
5,Excellent game. A must buy!,"If you are a WWF fan this is the game for you!It is better than NITRO,and much much better than THUNDER and WARZONE!I got 2 words for ya' BUY IT!"
3,GOOD BUT BAD,tHIS GAME IS A VERY WELL IDEA FOR A WRESTLING GAME FOR ALL AGES. ONLY ONE THING WRONG WITH THE WHOLE GAME AND THAT IS THAT IT IS TO HARD TO DO THE MOVES.
1,borrrrriiiinnnnngggggg,I like guitars but this cd is very boring. All the guitars sound the same and the players don't play very fast. The drummer is cool though.
1,Wrong version advertized,"The description of this DVD claims that it is the ORIGINAL English version of the recording. In fact, the voices have been dubbed in with American actors.I am not impressed."
5,"It's true, this game R-O-C-K-S.","I have no words to describe this game. It's got it all: Looks, plot, sounds, everything. Simply amazing, truly one of the best RPGs ever."
3,xeno gears,xeno gears is a pretty good game. it has good graphics. im a weird person and i like the gore. even though i like it i would prefur FF more anyday.
3,ok... I guess,The graphics are horrible...4 words to rate it.THEY ARE BITS FOR PETE SAKE!!!!!!!!!!I just think they SUCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!But the story is good ok...I guess.
5,Best game ever made in history!,This is by far the greatest game ever made. I have it on display in my house.
5,an rpg that is absolutly stunning,"with Xenosaga forthcoming, (its in the mail!) I was remebering the first, Xenogears. I played this when it first came out back in 98', and I can safely say it changed my gaming completely. Xenogears' has a captivating story, and at the time its gameplay was impossible to dislike. Remarkably, the Japanese makers did a wonderful job on creating a story with a relgion similiar to that of the West. Insightful views on a world dominated completely by the 'shepards' high above in the sky, and the lives of the 'lambs' on the earth.Theres no easy way to say it, I get all confuddled just trying. 5+ for story, 5+ for gameplay.You like rpgs? You'll love this classic"
5,I never thought...,"I never thoughts that Xenogears would be so great. Really. I must say, it has a confusing plot, throughout most of the beginning. But, later on, things will become alot clearer, and easier to understand. The graphics aren't exactly great, the characters and such are a bit blurry and may take some getting used to. There are cut scenes, anime style, which include decent voice acting. This is a hard game to find, but it's worth the money you'll pay!"
4,"Excellent video, quality routine and lead-follow techniques","This is a very good good video for beginning swing dancers. Of any videos i've seen, this one does the best job of teaching lead and follow techniques. And the routine that is taught is more than plenty to get you dancing socially and kicking it up. This is a good one!"
2,For Beginners Only,"If you're a true beginner you might get something out of this DVD, but if you have had any dance experience it is a complete waste of time. I put the DVD on fast forward to go through the steps, and it was still too slow and basic. Truly a DVD for beginners with no dance experience."
