4,Cornwell's Suspense Moves Up a Notch,"Patricia Cornwell is one author I really enjoy. With Black Notice her talents have really shined. She shows real life family friction, deep remorse, and has taken a total unthinkable gruesome character and pulled off a great read. It was a page turner; a book I couldn't put down. Gory - yes. But her superb writing skills pulled it off. Can't wait for the next book. Love the characters. They are real with real people problems. Entwined with suspense that continuously amazes me. Go Cornwell, Go!!!"
4,This book reads like a body blow to the stomach!,"This is a great read! First, it's nice to read about someone who isn't blond, in great shape, and under 30! Scarpetta is more ""real"" here than in any previous works. So what if there are some untidy loose ends? After reading the reviews, all I can conclude is that this book provokes intense feelings. After reading the book, I conclude that it was ""worth the candle."""
2,"Dark, depressing, bitter and below par","I've enjoyed nearly all of the Scarpetta books since Body Farm, which was the first I read. But what a letdown this book was! It is dark, brooding, angry, bitter and -- just in case you still think you'll like it -- boring. After Cornwell became disillusioned with the FBI (in Point of Origin) she lost her focus. Worse, she seems to have lost the enjoyment of writing, and passes that mood on to her readers. None of the characters seems true to form. Marino is angry, Lucy is spoiled and selfish, and even Scarpetta's colleagues seem to be tiring of the good doctor. Never mind the plot ... you know you're in trouble when Cornwell has to resolve the mystery by having the prime suspect literally walk up to Scarpetta's front door. (Don't worry, I haven't given anything away -- you'll see this coming from 50 pages away). If you're a dedicated Scarpetta fan, you may find this book too gloomy. If you're new to the series, start with one of the earlier books."
3,How Many Times Can People Be Out for Kay,"I really liked the beginning of this book -- with the letter from Benton. However, as I read along I felt like I've read this story before. Kay being depressed, Lucy being angry, Marino on the verge of a heart attack. Kay takes a new lover to bed but are we really supposed to believe that one night of sex justifies ""Don't fall in love with me""? Come on. These books are starting to read more like a bad Romance stories, not a medical thriller. Hope the next book explains more about the serial killer in this story as we only got to learn about his afliction, not what makes him tick."
1,waste of time,It said it was about girls going to a nudist beach.They went the beach for about five minutes and it was a topless beach.Iam trying to add to my nudist movies and these set backs don't help
4,Girls Can Swim,"This movie is a typical French film; with down and out parents and depressed kids and great scenery.In this film we see two young girls who have vacationed together every summer at the beach.But you have to pay close attention as the film follows one girls story then back tracts to follow the other girl and what she was doing at the same time, until her story catches up with where the first girls story left off.The girls do not have a happy life until they get together and then things get strained and by the end of the film their relationship will change forever."
1,awful,"I love rock, I love classical music. I would have thought mixing both genres would lead to great music. I was wrong. Malmsteen's playing was annoying and kept calling attention to itself instead of adding to the music."
1,"SHOULD BE NO STARS, UTTER CRAP","So here it is, Malmsteen ripping out the same licks over and over again. When is this man going to realise that the Public are bored sh**less of this stuff. People use to say that Malmsteen was one of the best guitarists in the world, but after his fourth album they started to realise that all this man can do is play heartless speed runs in the same friggin key all the time, and only in his tiny mind will he ever be regarded as one of the greats. Neo-classical rock is dead and as for the lyrics on this album they are just pathetic. All I can say is that this album demonstrates for the umpteenth time that YGM is unable to progress out of the Eighties, or write anything of commercial original quality. So the only Nerds that will like this album are the really simple ones."
3,Really Just More Of The Same,"I cut my teeth technically as a guitar player on the Rising Force and Marching Out albums so I'll always have respect for Yngwie for giving us those 2 albums. At that time his technical ability and style were novel and us guitarists took note. However, I agree with most of the lukewarm reviews here. Yngwie does recycle the same old diminished runs, harmonic minors runs and scalar patterns over and over and has done so on every album since those 2 aforementioned. It would be refreshing to hear him do some soloing in a major key for instance...I know he can do it...he almost never does though. This style of music needs to have alot of refreshing nuance, tempo changes, and scale variations and arpeggios to be interesting...Yngwie doesnt seem to want to explore new musical areas...he needs too...Having said that this album isnt horrible...its simply just more of the same."
2,Very uneven,"This book has all the feeling of a book of essays cobbled together into a book so the essayist can get paid for the same work a second time. The thin thread of the painting fails to provide a way to sustain the reader's interest from episode to episode, and the device of working backward in time leaves the uncomfortable feeling of knowing in advance what will happen to this painting that some have loved and some just possessed. I would rate the book even lower but for the wonderful description of Vermeer's technique in the first chapter! The book's small redeeming grace is that it can be read so quickly that not a lot of time is wasted on it."
2,A slow read,"The first hundred pages of this book were fairly monotonous. The story picks up a bit after that, but most people might not make it that far. I did like the concept--following the owners of a painting all the way back to the painter--but the actual product just didn't live up to my expectations."
5,The Price of Beauty,"This book is a masterpiece, like the painting (real or imaginary) which inspires it. Each short story has a life of it's own and yet when read together all are interwoven by the common thread of the painting. Some stories will appeal more than others, some are haunting and painfull; all are beautiful, evocative and real. Anyone who has pondered the relationship between beauty and money, the creative urge and the need to make a living will find this work poignant. It brought to mind Orwell's ""Keep the Aspidistra Flying"" and Mary Gordon's ""Spending"". The former is realistic, the latter utopian. ""Girl in Hyacinth Blue"" portrays the subject from all angles. Illuminating and perfectly balanced, quite beautiful."
4,A Book of Short Stories,"This book is really a book of short stories woven together and proceeding backwards chronologically to trace the provenance of the painting. The stories are not connected very well although they build on each other, the transitions from one story to the next are not very good but the concept works if you treat each as a standalone story. Where this novel really shines is in Vreelands descriptive prose. She excels in evoking the emotions and feelings evident in a piece of art work, even if the art is fictional. I liked the writing so well that I wished the painting existed so I could see it. The story development itself was a little disappointing but it was a surprisingly quick read."
4,"Uniquely written, captures the spirit of life and love","Vreeland takes you in the world of life and love with multiple related stories thru the fictional Vermeer painting, Girl in Hyacinth Blue. You can feel a little bit of yourself in each of the stories as they see the painting from each of their own unique perspective. A great read."
2,A HISTORY OF NON-NOTE,"One amateur critic thought this story mesmerizing. This amateur critic disagrees. I read this aloud to my wife and both of us agree that about 3 chapters were really interesting and the rest was not ""of note."" The only data I really wanted to know was if this was a Vermeer or not. I will let the reader discover the answer."
5,Beautiful Book!,"I really loved this book. I do have to admit though, at the beginning I kept having to remind myself that the stories were going backward in time.I really do not love short stories, but this really attracted me, each story related to the one painting, and each story so connected. This is my first book by this author, she writes with such beauty and insight....I look forward to reading her others."
3,Too much like a series of short stories.,There wasn't enough history in this for me. Rembrandt by Gladys Schmittwas more informative. I think the author is more fanciful when viewing a work of art.
3,Girl in Hyacinth Blue,"I enjoyed the book, it's format was different as it went from present to past. I love historical fiction, and this one gives you some history. It was enjoyable."
2,Not of note,"I had high hopes, but I expected more of a literary quality in this book. I found the sentences obvios and the emotion planned. It seemed too simple to be authentic. It didn't draw me in at all."
2,a disappointment,"I wanted this book to be good. It is attractively packaged and the premise of the story seemed promising. Reading the book's words brought only a two dimensional vision, and an unoriginal vision at that. There is nothing new here for anyone who has heard the word ""nazi"", and mediocre prose to convey a listless and painfully forced story."
5,You will not be dissapointed,"This thing is a beast. It is very well built, extremely durable, easy to use. This is night and day difference between anything at Home Depot or Lowes. My only warning - it is heavy, especially full (around 27-30 pounds depending on what you put in it). This is not a problem for me, but something to consider if you are a small person or intend to use this for many hours."
4,just great,"what I needed was rewireable or pigtail 2-pin connectors but those don't seem easy to find. maybe if there was an RV store near me, but...but honestly finding this was even better. and the price is unbelievable.(what I really needed these for, is to cut in half and reverse the polarity. yeah, I know, danger will robinson. but it turns out that chaining up certain other connectors on my solar system results in wrong polarity in the first place, so to fix that... yeah, it scares me too.)"
5,Dragon & Phoenix is Absolutely Excellent !!!,"I never get tired of listening to this album. Each track is distinctly different, yet the entire recording flows seamlessly from one track to the next. As a devout practitioner of Chinese Chi Gung and Tai Chi, I reach for this CD over and over again. I also highly recommend it for New Age audiences, and even for long sessions at the computer (keep those shoulders from tensing up!) It's really, really great!"
4,Why didn't Vanessa Williams become a Broadway star?,"The most beautiful of all Miss Americas (with the POSSIBLE exception of only Lee Meriweather), Vanessa Williams has an absolutely gorgeous voice made just for musical theatre. Here, on this Encores! recording of the famous Harold Arlen musical, she gives what I would call the definitive performance of ""Anywhere I Hang My Hat is Home,"" which is saying something given her competition over the decades. Why she never fully turned her talents towards Broadway will mystify you after hearing her on this magnificent recording. The rest of the cast does beautifully with some of Arlen's most beautiful music: I notice here some criticisms of Helen Goldsby, and though her voice isn't always as true here as it could be, she is quite moving on ""I Wonder What Became of Me"" (she is a marvelous actress, as anyone ever fortunate enough to see her on Broadway in ""Master Class"" could attest)."
1,An example of a bad movie,"This is one of the worst Hindi movies, I have seen in my life. There is nothing good about this movie except for a few songs. The direction is very bad. How can someone dance with a fractured leg? Some people may find the romance and drama very entertaining, however, I like movies that are more realistic. Shahrukh Khan is not as good an actor as people feel about him. In fact, he is one of the worst actors ever born on the planet earth. The only meaningful film, I ever saw of Shahrukh Khan was Swadesh."
2,don't waste you time,"Don't waste your money,you need the model number,it's ok for the price,but it didn't fit my oven right,it wouldn't go in all the way(neither 1 of the 2 parts) to light the oven & for the price it's not wortht it to ship it back."
4,People in chocolate candy,"This was a great movie. I first watched it in 1989. At the beginning three men accidentally fell in a vat of chocolate. The man responsible for the men falling in was Ian Littleton.People liked this candy with humans in it very well. Because the people liked this candy, the candy manufacturers assumed that people would like the candy with pigs and cows in it but they didn't. People wanted to eat chocolates with people in them. Because of this, Littleton was ordered by his bosses to start putting dead people in the chocolate candy and people went crazy for the candy; not knowing there were bits of people in them. This movie was funny.I read on Wikipedia that this movie is hard to find in the USA but I found it quite easily. I bought it right here at amazon and you should do the same. I give this film a 4 star rating."
4,Fahrenheit 451,"I will first disclose that I am not a science fiction fan, however the guts of this story are far from science fiction. Very foretelling when you remember the time during which this book was written. So interesting that so many readers were horrified at the thought of a world like that and now they are living in that world in many ways!!"
4,"Good movie, awful audio","We watched this over the weekend on Amazon Instant Video. We had no complaint with the movie other than the audio, which I believe has more to do with the production and not Amazon. Whenever it would break from dialogue and start with the music, the music was far too loud. We'd turn it down and then would have to readjust again when the dialogue would start back up."
3,I'm not going to romanticize this for you.,"So as you can see everyone loves this movie. I don't. ""Were such good friends I don't want to mess up what we have by getting involved"" This phrase may not totally sum up my feelings on this movie but I figured that we've all heard it before.Doctor Zhivago is David Lean's weakest movie. While that alone means it is better than about 70% of the movie out there. I have to hold this movie up to pretty high standards. The love story I just couldn't buy totally. The Russian history was interesting but was just another underdeveloped character.I really wanted to love this movie but I couldn't. The score was wonderful, along with the sets. But too much of the movie seemed rushed and many interesting parts were just left to dangle. I still recommend this movie just not as much as I would have liked."
5,A Timeless Piece,"The depth of this master piece is timeless for all generations to come. Compared to what we are having on the market today, most of them are cheap, superficial and rediculous, I recommand this movie to everyone; at least watch it once to experiece what real love and real life are."
2,Technical problems,The movie is great. That is not an issue. I can't get it to play if full blu-ray with surround sound in the English version just the other 5-6 languages. I've tried different receiver settings and moved through the choices on the movies menu but can't figure put how to change it to the correct setting for English. Picture is good but sound isn't (except on the foreign language settings.
4,Nice romance in a history context. Adultery?,"beautiful scenery, music and acting. Context of Russian history. Makes history human. Seems like an innocent wonderful romance but is it adultery?"
4,Doctor Zhivago,I was extremely pleased to receive this DVD in such a timely manner. It was everything plus what was promised.
4,Sweeping historical epic,A sweeping portayal of love and betrayal in the chaos of the Russian revolution. One of the great epics.
4,Better than they say,"I remember being about 5 years old watching this movie and thinking it was the greatest movie of all time. But then about 5 years later I was driving down the street and say a poster for the Buffy TV Show. I ran home and looked up when It premired and it was that night. I watched the first episode and never looked back til about a year ago. The film was still funny, but after seening the TV which is an outstanding show, it was kind-of cheesy. If you like comedy-horror films this is for you, if you like serious horror with a touch of comedy stick to the show. But it is nice to see how greaty improved Joss Whedon has come (Thank God). If your a fan - perfect, if your not - stay clear away."
3,Ben. . . .,"This movie is based differently then the tv series, but one thing that I must say, is look for Ben Afflec as player 7 on the opposing team."
1,i ordered this movie and instead of getting another one refund instead,i ordered this movie and it was damaged it stopped and started and the voices were out of sync so instead of replacing the damaged goods all i got was a refund
3,Good!,After I first started watching the television show Buffy the Vampire Slayer I decided I liked the show so much I wanted to buy the seasons on DVD so I bought the first season and also since this is the movie that started it all I decided to buy the DVD for the theatrical movie and I watched it and While I agree with the comments that this is a lightweight version of Buffy it is a cute movie and I pretty much liked it and though The television show is definitely better and I prefer Sarah Michelle Gellar as Buffy I think the movie is okay and that Kristy Swanson was good and I recommend that all fans of the television show watch this movie at least once. I try to watch this movie once a year usually around Halloween.
1,UGH!,"To think that a great TV show was born of this disaster is astounding! This film tried to be a comedy but it failed miserably. It tried to be an action film, but it failed miserably. The lead actress playing Buffy has the talent of a thimble. The whole idea of Buffy was retooled for TV and it was amazing."
2,"This movie is alright, but the show is ALOT better!","I thought that the movie was alright, but i think that the show is a whole lot better because it has popular stars, good plots, and it involves more creatures other than vampires! On the whole, the show is alot better!"
2,IF YOU WANT BUFFY THE SHOWS BETTER NOT THE MOVIE,"the movie stunk the writer of both the movie and the show ""Joss Whedon"" has gotten alot better the movie is funny now and then but that all the good in it the only reason i saw the movie is becouse i'm hooked on the show and trust me stick with the show"
1,Not worth your time. I 'm not sure it's worth one star.,"The movie version of Buffy is NOTHING and I mean nothing like the tv series. Joss Whedon..Buffy's creator had little to do with the end product of the movie version. In an interview a few years back, he basically said he walked away from it. Apparently, Donald Sutherland was insufferable to work with and went about changing the movie and many of his lines. Joss Whedon does not have many nice things to say about Donald Sutherland after that experience. So, what you see in the movie was not Joss' vision for what Buffy was supposed to be like. The TV show however, is."
3,Okay,"Enjoyed reading the different point of view on the translation of Genesis in comparison to other ANE cultures. With that said, I felt like I was left questioning some of his supporting arguments. I felt they could also be interpreted as materialistic as well."
4,Informative but tough sledding,"DrEwgog (Croton NY)Be prepared for an academic read; more graduate school text than most. By ""prepared"" I mean to suggest you enlist a weed cutter and a large thermos of strong coffee. Still I recommend it for the info."
5,Ringo never sounded better!,"A combination of Beatles' songs and Ringo's music over the last 30 years. Good selection of music from a great band. They have a good groove throughout the CD and a good balance of vocals & instruments. Ringo gives narratives on the origins and background of some of the songs. If you get the chance, find a copy of the VH1 videotape. It's great to see Ringo react with the band & a live audience.A great CD to listen and sing along! If you are a Ringo fan, don't miss this one!"
5,Best Bill Evans CD,I have been listening to What's New for the last 25 years. This is Bill Evans' best.
3,popped and belched smoke!,This was a replacement for BlueMax 1/2 HP Garage Door Opener. It lasted less than six months before belching a puff of smoke and looking like a cross between microprocessor and flypaper. This time I replaced the whole opener!
1,Never wholly believe others' opinions (this included),"I am sorry but I was never able to appreciate this book. I found the plot boring, the characters uninteresting and no ingenious ideas whatever. It was not unconvincing; there simply wasn't anything to grab your attention. Moreover, I thought the style a bit similar to the unfeelingness of cyberpunk -- and since I take great delight in fantasy, cyberpunk is the last thing I'd like a fantasy book to remind me of. The problem is that I read ""Lords of the Sky"" immediately after Zelazny's Amber series -- how is it possible to rate these two works equally? (Also, if it is REALLY better than the rest of Wells' books, you'll have to introduce negative values on your rating scale.)Anyway, you should try it (as well as any other book) yourself. Judgements are always subjective; and tastes vary extremely."
3,Kind of dry,"He writes about being in the NBA but it's during the 70's when it was so different from now. Players didn't make mega millions then. I can't believe they would still have to do their own laundry and share a hotel room with someone on the team. But it's a nice glimpse into the 70's and professional basketball, I guess. The basketball writing is okay, I've read much better. His writing is pretty dead."
3,Great stuff here!,"The Bluesman dishes up a heaping helping of soulful guitar sopped, funk-filled blues! Recorded in Paris in '97, Johnson offers up ten cuts that will please traditionalists and edge blues listeners alike! His reggae smacked ""The Street You Live On"" shows Johnson's versatility. Late guitar great Luther Allison even sits in on ""End of The Road."" One favorite is ""My Baby by My Side."" A disc well worth listening to!"
2,Does not work,The first four seasons were great. Did not want the episodes to end.This one you cant wait for it yo end.
1,Not one of her best,I'm a BIG FAN of Emilie Richards but I have to disagree with many of the reviewers here. I did not like this book. I felt that too many characters were introduced too fast. I found myself getting lost many times trying to remember who was who and having to page back over and over again. I never had to do that with her other books.I've read about 8 of her books and loved every one of them so I was looking forward to this one but I cannot recommend it to anyone unless you have a memory that is much better than average to keep track of everything.Jackie from Calif.
3,Numbers Confirm Creation,Each number represent God something about His name or what it has to do with creation. It proves nothing done in creation was by evolution. God had a purpose for everything that was created. I would have preferred the hard back version better it was easier to read & understand.
3,Remote Control Tank,Good Air Soft Tank. Ordering was easy and shipping was good. The Tank works good with only two exceptions; battery life is short and the rubber tracks are not built well. Do to the track on one side becoming stretched - the tank pulls to that direction. Price was okay- yet I would pay more for a better quality Tank. For the price and service it is satisfactory.
5,too cool,"With a new album on the way, i thought i'd put a quickie about the old. This album is just too cool. With the opening ""vicious"" to the close of ""opinata"", you'll sit there with this garage-esque beer drinking hoser band (Canadian, eh?) thinking ""it doesn't get much better""."
3,Funny but the worst of the $ seasons,"Earl, Randy, Crabman and the rest of the MNIE gang are hilarious, but season three is the one to skip if you were to skip any season. I like season 1 and season 4 the best - outstanding and incredibly funny. all the season have some small amounts of sexual stuff, but FF and enjoy the rest.My Name Is Earl: Season FourThe King of Queens - The Complete Fourth Season"
3,"The worst of the four, still better than the best of most other comedies.","Great show that lost it's way for a stretch in this season and then more or less returned to form later. It seems like they resorted to a bit too much raunchy humor in these last two seasons but the heart of the show was still there.I'd like to see an hour reunion show where they wrap things up. Also, there wasn't enough Pigsquatch."
5,Gave me what I needed,"At the time when I bought this (used for very cheap), I had several years experience supporting applications on MSSQL databases. So, I became decently skilled at T-SQL DML (But, very weak on DDL). Then, I got a new position working strickly with DML in Oracle 10g. This book allowed me to learn some of the trappings or Oracle' ANSI SQL DML. But, it also made me understand some concepts that I wasn't fully clear on in MSSQL T-SQL. Good read. Its several years old, but still relevant. This stays on my desk now. Theres alot of stuff covered in here thats on some of the OCA SQL exams like 1Z0-047 and 1Z0-051.I also bought it as an ebook from the Android Market. That was great as well - especially for office toilet time.Note that this doesn't really go into PL\SQL... Theres only a very short chapter that talks about the concept of a PL\SQL progam, but thats it. If you need PL\SQL coding, there's another OReily book for that. But, I like the fact that this book is focused on ANSI SQL."
2,Waste of money..,"If you are of the type who would like to look at an oracle query example, run it against a database and watch the results - do yourself a favor. Stay away from this book.But if you like reading oracle queries like a fiction novel - by all means get this book. The book talks about a parts distributor database the scripts for which Mr. DB Administrator Sanjay Mishra has decided to lock in his closet.I am fuming with anger at the uselessness of this book. This book has good content which goes down the drain because of the ZERO PRACTICAL test. I am giving it a rating 2 coz the content covers what it intents to cover - basics of SQL. Barring that fact, this book is worth only a rating of .5"
5,Beautifully Captured Journey,"Buettner and Mason hit the mark with this beautifully illustrated and well written narrative of their journey through the Mayan lands. This is a must have for all children and adults who have an interest in anthropology or who have ever dreamt of traveling through foreign lands.Two Thumbs Up, Boys!"
4,some great tunes but not as good as frontiers/escape/infinity,"the songs on ror are good in their own right but they are too ballady for me and i tend to prefer ballads. the songs lack the rocking edge in frontiers and the simplicity of infinity. sort of too polished a sound in my opinion and the fact that smith and valory weren't featured on this album made it lose a few points in my book. again, i bought this for the collectible digipak packaging which included a booklet with old pictures and tour dates. but this time they were all pics of just the trio rather than the power quintet. my favorite tracks were happy to give and eyes of a woman."
4,Still a great album after all these years,"Girl can't help it, Be Good to yourself, Suzanne are in my opinion the best tracks on this album. I think this album is definitely on par with their older stuff, though it definitely had more of a ""pop"" like sound to it than prior albums."
3,Choose the right age for your kids to watch these,"I loved the movie, but my five-year-old niece balled her eyes out watching Red Balloon and couldn't continue halfway through the movie because she found it too sad. She's a sensitive one, so if your child is highly-sensitive or might not be ready for this at a young age, you might want to consider letting him/her watch it at an older age."
5,Overlooked Gem,"This fine collection combines three tracks the great tenor saxophonist Gene Ammons recorded with a quartet (piano, bass, drums) in 1962 and four tracks recorded with a sharp studio orchestra in 1961. Some releases that combine different sessions and/or bands are awkward; this is not one of them. The disc is well paced and cohesive, with a number of highlights, including a wonderful version of Fletcher Henderson's ""Soft Winds"" (originally made famous by Benny Goodman's Sextet with Charlie Christian) and Clark Terry's fine work on a terrific version of Mercer Ellington's ""Things Ain't What They Used To Be."" As usual, Ammons' tone is distinctive, rich, and swinging. Highly recommended."
2,"Worst of the Year, except for small views of Barcelona.","I had no idea what was going on in this movie. I know for sure I wish they would have shown more views of Gaudi artwork and buildings. However, they failed at that and showing other parts of the fantastic city I heard of but never saw. Lot of yelling, in this hard to watch movie if you like fighting however."
3,This is what happens when great groups breakup...........,"The landscape of rap had changed dramatically in the 5 years that EPMD was broke up. Due to the major drama in hiphop that went down in the preceding 12 months, E & the P decided to make amends and drop another joint. This joint is just okay. Nothing like the 4 classic joints that dropped between 88 and 92."
3,"A good overall book, needed some touching up.","A little too much for me, spirits killing people, it was a little over the top, I would only reccomend this book to people who have already read books either in this series or in the genre altogether, It also helps if you're a Star Wars fan! Have fun!"
4,For the fiend.,"There is some filler here I cant lie. But if you love Bobby Byrd like I do,then you just have to buy this Cd. All the hits are here. Call it a guiltless pleasure and enjoy it."
1,LAME!,"Sorry, but what happened to this author??? She used to be witty and interesting. Now she has gotten so lame. The contrived humor, the one-note characters, the gimmicky plot devices. I used to love her work but the last two books have been real stinkers! Also the stuff with Min's mother reminding her about her weight kept falling flat because these weren't remotely well-crafted or nuanced interactions. Instead, Crusie keeps beating us over the head with what we're supposed to find funny. I wish someone would tell this author to stop trying so maybe her books would feel natural again."
2,Does she get the guy? Does she? Just guess!,"[spoiler alert!]of course, of course. All the characters are paper cutouts and you know it all in chapter one. Way too predictable. Though this does have the spin of fat girl gets the cute guy!"
1,Boring,"I am a avid reader, but in opening this book, the story is so confusing and you can't keepup with all the changes and down right boring. Worst book I ever bought. I flat coundn't finish it."
1,Unfortunate,"After waiting for over a year for a new Crusie, Bet Me was a big disappointment. The gimmicky plot was bad enough (A grown man still betting on whether or not he'll score with a woman? Give me a break!), let alone the cloying cutesyness of the unending props, but what really killed it for me was that I simply didn't like these people. With two minor exceptions, they were whiney, immature, bitchy, bitter, and boring. The minor exceptions themselves were drearily smug. Not even Crusie's trademark style can save this one. Too bad."
5,Wow!,"If you're going to read a new author THIS is the one! Absolutely the best book I have read in months! I hope all her others are as good, because my book budget is toast!"
4,I liked it!,"I, like a few others, was a little underwhelmed with ""Faking It."" Nevertheless, I decided to give ""Bet Me"" a try. I liked the two primary characters and their quick repartee and the building ""tension"" between the two. The early description of the cat had me chuckling and awakened my dog out of her sweet slumber. I finished the book last night and thought to myself, ""that was a sweet story"" maybe because I too, am in search of my own fairy tale. That's by two cents worth."
2,Not my cup of tea,"This was my first Jennifer Cruise novel and selected because of the large number of positive reviews. Writing was smooth but I didn't really enjoy the storyline. Fat girl gets hot-hunky guy who enjoys watching her eat?? I consider myself a 'fat' girl (I'm about 40# overweight) and I wouldn't consider dating a guy who was smaller than me or kept offering me doughnuts!! The heroine tried on the hero's shirt and couldn't even button it because it was too small on her.I enjoy other author's 'fat' girl romances, such as 'Wishes' by Jude D. and 'Night Play' by Sherrilyn K. because the heros were BIG hot hunky guys and weren't determined to watch the heroine eat. I plan to try to another of Ms. Cruize books and hope for the best."
3,Fun romantic comedy,"3.7 stars I enjoyed this romantic twisted knot of a tale. The women had strong independent roles and were intelligent. I've had enough of the poor dumb women clichés'. It was filled with quick snarky lines and tender sweet moments. Yes there was a'bad' buy and although he wasn't stupid he was an idiot and very believable idiot.Now about the story, I don't really need to tell you anything about it. It's a contemporary romance, there is a cat, a handsome man, a woman,one witch of a woman, the evil man, some friends, two crazy nut-o families and some really good Italian food. If you're looking for fun, light romantic comedy with a HEA this is a good book for you."
4,Very cute story,I love Jennifer Crusie's books and loved this one too. The part when he has her tied up feeding her doughnuts is hilarious. Although with all the food in this book it made me hungry.
5,excellent recording!,My husband is a frequent sax player w/ JD Sumner here in Memphis. This recording is wonderful!
5,HILARIOUS Book of Science and Technology Cartoons,"I'm not a scientist and don't pretend or intend to be. Nevertheless, I thought this book was hilarious. Harris does for science and technology what Scott Adams (who created the *Dilbert* cartoon) does for the business world. He illustrates the funny sides of the scientific and technological environments in such a simple and funny way that just about everyone can enjoy it.If you have even the remotest interest in science and/or technology . . . or even if you just think that some of what goes on in those environments can be a little wacky or bizarre at times, then this book will definitely make you laugh out loud."
1,Astonishingly bad,"This movie is not worth watching. I was honestly looking forward to it, and it was truly lacking in anything worthy of praise. The acting was awful. The writing was worse. The music consisted of one song, and it was a bad song. I watched this with several people and we were all left with the same impression that this was a poorly constructed movie. The only thing that is even slightly worthy of praise would be the premise. It does have an interesting premise, but unfortunately the story was not told in such a way that would make me recommend this movie."
1,Mighty mouse is mighty touchy,"If you are looking for a two button mouse, get one with well defined left and right sides. With this one, it is not easy to click left or right due to the one-piece hard shell - sometimes getting the opposite result."
1,Unable to use this mouse without an extension USB cord,The cord on this mouse is so short that I am unable to use it with my Apple lap top. I am right handed and all of the USB ports are on the left side. The cord isn't long enough to go around my computer to the other side.
3,"Pretty neat, but sadly not for lefties","Yay! At long last, Apple has released a multi-button mouse. Its most inspired feature is the single button that can detect left and right clicks, so the single mouse suits both novices and experts. It is certainly better than the complicated Microsoft mouse with six or eight buttons that I was given at work.Unfortunately, the mouse is not without its flaws. First, I find the side buttons nearly impossible to use, though I don't really miss them. Second, I usually use my mouse left-handed, but the mechanism used to detect a left- or right-click just doesn't work with the way I hold the mouse with my left hand. Right-handed, though, it works great. I am still getting accustomed to the roller ball, and the jury is still out.So if you need a new mouse, you should consider getting one of these. If you're right handed and like Apple's previous line of mice, then you'll probably like this one. But if you're left handed then I strongly recommend to try before you buy."
5,Mighty Mighty Good Mouse,Well Apple does it again this time its the pro mouse reincarnated into the mighty mouse. I was so freakin pumped to buy the mouse when it first hit the apple website. So when I saw it in the apple shop I had to buy it. WELL first I'm disappointed that it only runs really good in Tiger not Panther (I guess I should have read it in the store before the apple buying bug hit me oh well)but it still runs good. The track ball is a great feature I'm loving the horizontal thing and the right and left click. Great mouse but now this going to make me go out and get OS X Tiger fully unleash the power that lies inside.
1,What's so mighty about this?,Finally someone at Apple realized that a single button mouse was not enough for the complex tasks so they decided to put a bunch of designers to create something completely new. Something no one has ever seen. A mouse with two buttons and a 'special' button that allows you to go multi directions. At a bargain for just a bit under $50.For $50 you get a super duper high tech mouse that has so much precision that you can get a whopping gazillion dpi for dead on accuracy. But don't go looking for that spec in their website. It's super secret.
2,Apple... Come on!!!!,"One thing apple lacks is the ability to design a mouse that is easy to control. At first I thought it was cool, apple came out with a mouse that had 2 buttons with the scroll plus the squeezable sides. First thing I did was turn off the sides, I could just grab the mouse and it would activate the sides. I also have a problem with the scroll ball it's way too sensitive!Now I wish I would have spent have the money and bought a Logitech!"
2,Works OK - when it works,I have had the Mighty Mouse for several years. Scrolling works OK. My Microsoft mouse seemed to have much better/smoother scrolling.The roller ball was the first to fail. I had the mouse cleaned and the ball worked poorly for another couple of months - then failed completely.I have talked and blogged with many others who have had the same problems. Apple needs to upgrade their mouse products.
2,scroll button soon fails,"When it works it's fine. The first few times, you can clean it with an alcohol soaked cloth BUT almost invariably the scroll button on top gets so gunked up it can't be cleaned without literally cutting off part of the bottom to get at the items--a highly skilled technician task. check on the Internet by searching for ""cleaning apple mouse or scrollbutton"" and you'll see for yourself. Apple should be thoroughly ashamed of producing such a defective design."
2,You gotta clean it!,"I have had the wired Mighty Mouse for three months with my new Intel iMac. A few days ago the scrollwheel stopped working. I used a textured cleaning pad on it and it now is fine. I hope this lasts but at least for now I have my scrolling capacity back. Forget right and left click capabilities, they don't work. I wish Apple would finally give it up and create a fully functional professional quality mouse. This is a start but that's all."
4,The print should have been restored,"The content of this disc is interesting. However, given the level of technology we have today, greater care should have been taken to correct the blue and green discolorations on the print.Ben Hur does, after all, hold the record for the number of Oscars received by any film."
5,A Great Classic And One Of My Top 20 Of All Time,I want to write this review because I have both the DVD and the VCR of Ben Hur and the DVD is so much better that it is difficult to believe. The clarity and detail of the DVD make watching this great film a whole new experience. The chariot race is the greatest action sequence ever filmed and it is thrilling to watch with DVD. I have quite a collection of VCR movies but I've purchased this movie and about two dozen others for the joy of REALLY seeing it as I never have before. The added features about the making of the movie are also very enjoyable.
5,Generational Masterpiece!,"Ben Hur is a timeless masterpiece which will reverbrate through the ages. Today, Hollywood rarely approaches the pinnacle this movie represents -- how unfortunate. Where are the likes of a William Wyler (Ben Hur), Anthony Mann (El Cid), David Lean (Lawrence of Arabia) or a John Ford (numerous western classics) and other Master Directors of earlier years. Granted, there are some today, but they are few and far between. Unfortunately, the upcoming Blu-Ray version GOUGES at the OUTRAGEOUS price of $44.99. I'll stick with my DVD."
4,PICTURE IS GREAT; SOUND SUCKS!,"I don't understand how they could release this classic (and I'm talking about the 4 disc set which Amazon does not separate from the previously released single-disc) with such terrible sound...it is awfully inconsistent...the chariot race is muffled and numerous scenes are ruined by loud/soft issues...otherwise, it gets the special treatment it deserves. But it's a shame it wasn't done right."
5,Great classic movie,"It was luck, or Amazon logic that I was thinking about getting this movie and this one pops up! I loved this movie as a kid and this is a great edition. The quality is fantastic and so far, my family and kids love it too!"
5,Ben Hur,"This is arguably the best movie I have ever seen. I saw it in the theater when it came out & went back several times to see it again. I couldn't have been happier when it came out on tape & I could see it uncut for TV again--even though it was a cumbersome 2 tape deal. Now, this 50th anniversary DVD version fills my heart with nostalgia & great happiness. The 2 books add a depth to the story of the making off the movie that was enjoyable as well as informative. The extra discs provide insight as well as entertainment. It was even interesting viewing the silent version made back in the 1920's. It is reassuring that this 50+ year old movie still means enough to the industry that they would issue this commemorative edition. I was surprised to see it was numbered as part of a limited edition."
5,Quick and perfect,Got it faster then I thought. Made the perfect Christmas gift because I got it before Christmas. Am most happy and will definitely go threw them again for future items
4,Same movie with more frills,"Ben Hur has always been my favorite movie. This edition presents the theatrical screen version in which it was played along with enhanced colors. There is only one new bonus cd in which his son Frazier describes what it was like for the family while the movie was being made. The other cds are found in previous versions including the silent film.The collector's book is a welcome addition. Although it includes a copy of Charlton Heston's journal during production much of it is read by Frazier in the bonus cd. I would have preferred a better copy of the movie ""program"" which came with the last edition so that I could enjoy the movie the way it was shown in the theatres.The only other thing missing are the scene selections listings. For a epic movie, it is difficult to pick up where you leave off. If you already own this movie there's no need to buy another copy. If not then it is a worthwhile investment."
5,Ben-Hur 50th Anniversary Edition,Ben-Hur 50th Anniversary Edition - Very good quality. We want this for the blu ray. This is a fine movie and Charleton Heston does and outstanding job. The charot scene is my favorite.
3,Price Increase,The vendor I selected to purchase this DVD from increased their price 64% after I placed it on my wish list. The Price went to over $36.00 and it simply isn't worth that to me. There are other vendors with more reasonable pricing. It is always prudent to check all vendors for pricing and performance ratings.
4,Classic still classic,"Ben Hur is probably my altime favorite movies. I had it on VHS for years but we all know how antiquated those are today. Anyway, I finally replaced it for the std dvd and wow what was great is now even greater. Thank you Amazon for having Ben Hur in stock.The price was very competative and the service and shipping was ideal."
1,Old Copy OF Book,It looks like they have sold out the 5 version and are subsituting the earlier 4 version
5,Hot!!,"The manager of an apartment I lived in the early 80's was a member of a book club in which Delta of Venus and Little Birds were two that she had ordered. One day she brought them over and thought that I would like them.Now, I had never read erotica before, so I had no idea what to expect. I would say that those two books were my '50 shades of grey"" moment. I experienced something from reading those books that the majority of women had experienced as teenagers. I, of course, ended up buying the books myself, still have them and pop them open occasionally to read a few of the stories to the man in my life. Some liken erotica to sexual porn stories, but there is a world of difference.Erotic. Sensual. Tasteful. Anais Nin."
2,Frankly boring,"Anais Nin may have pushed back some boundaries in her day, but in the 21st century her writing holds little of value. Reading through the stories in Delta of Venus, I was bored by the repetitiveness, and the undeveloping one-dimensionality of her storylines and characters; her language is powerful and descriptive, but dishonest. It seemed a little sad that the stories' characters were so bound by the limitations of their sexuality. As a writer, she should have brought her characters more to life. The fact that these stories arose out of commissioned porn - if what Nin claims is true - is apparent."
1,A dissapointing text,"This is one of Nin's poorer texts. She leaves out her feminine style. In its place, she offers a crude and simplistic story line. I would encourage readers to try some of her other works."
3,Beauty or love - our choice - Anais aimed ...,I hope more and more people will discover the flame in her writings - and see the frustration and the real pain in this hard living woman. Please keep you heart protected while reading - it's a tuff one.
5,Sun Protection,"I like using these shirts for my kids who don't like sunscreen. These shirts were the best value, are comofortable and good quality. Remember not to put them in the dryer!"
4,It's not just Egypt and Nubia!,"(1959, Revised ed. 1970)A pleasure to read and very informative.Major themes:Neolithic & cultivation, stone tools & Iron-Age. First centuries B.C. & Medieval. Drystone masonry. Hilltop forts. Earthworks. Stepped hillsides for crops. Trade across Sahara & along east Africa. Influence from the north & east. Export of ivory, gold, iron, slaves."
1,Made of a poor material of who knows what,"This ring got broken the first week I use it. It's a weak ring that is know not useful. I paid for nothing. The stone was clear, it did not have a blue color and it was not a blue topaz."
2,Basic categorization.,"Does not seem to have personal extraction information. Not the perfect referance for owners or prior purchasers. Text is basic categories for owners or hunting animals. The author does not explain creature maintainence or dietary supplements. This manual is incomparable to other, more insightful guides. This also applies to The Essential Golden Retriever, which has no technical hints and mediocre purchasing information. Some breed books are unequaled, but this particular publishing is sub par."
3,"good price, easy to install","I have 2 rental properties with these throughout, by borough code. I'm required by code and by the fire inspector to replace these every 10 years. It seems to me that they should be reliable longer than that.At least the price was pretty low by accepting ""used"" items, which were stated to be new, but in opened containers.Also, they were compatible with existing (other brand) base and wire plug strip, so quick and easy to replace."
5,wired smoke detectors,These are easy to install. I did have to change the base on the current ones but this is easy-2 screws. I used these to replace same detectors that reached end of life.
1,John Schlitt = AntiChrist,"I'd like to thank Schlitt for proving Greg X.Volz took all the talent with him when he left the band. 'Petra' if you can even still call them that, have been reduced to a money-grabbing, commercial machine that would sing Marilyn Manson songs if they thought the public would buy it. This albumn is a gutless, shamefull, talentless, waste of time and energy that fails miserably. Schlitt ought to be fired and ashamed. NEWS FLASH JOHN: You can't compete with GREG VOLZ."
3,BLAHHHHHH!,"Maybe the remixes and new performances would have been better if John Schlit hadn't been so caught up with making this both a hard rock and praise rock both at the same time with his voice (if u can understand what I'm saying). Most of the original mixes were a lot better. The worst of all was Dance though. This is still alright if you haven't heard the original tracks, but I wouldn't recommend buying ti if yuo're looking for a new better twist on the classics.Also, is it just me? or is Petra making one too many re-released track albums? When r they finally going to put out an actual brand new album?"
1,OUCH!,"I was very eager to buy this album but a friend of mine told me not to. I said to him: What's wrong with it? So he let me borrow it.John, Lonnie, Louie, Pete, Trent, John and Dino, but most of all: BOB!!!:Put out another album like this and you can say goodbye to a great fan."
1,Unwatchable,"Thank goodness I got this as a gift and didn't waste any of my own money. I got about 20 minutes into it before I turned it off. Sorry to cast aspersions, but Princess Margaret was a beautiful woman when she was young, and Lucy Cohu is not... IMHO...easy on the eyes. She portrayed Margaret as shrill and sleazy with no redeeming qualities. I know Margaret was no saint, but it was so over the top. It almost changed my high opinion of Toby Stephens (who played Antony Armstrong-Jones), who was so good in the BBC version of ""Jane Eyre"" for being involved in this train wreck. This just does not seem worthy of the BBC. Do yourself a favor, buy ""Jane Eyre"" instead."
1,Utterly appalling!,"If I were able to do so, I would not award this DVD any stars at all. Whether or not Princess Margaret was a spoilt termagant with an overly inflated view of her own importance, only her contemporaries would know for a fact but, she's depicted as an absolute harpy in this DVD, a bossy, arrogant woman with a voracious sexual appetite who made the lives of those around her, miserable. Even if all of this is pure fiction, which I seriously doubt, the costuming for this movie was appalling! Margaret was a frumpy, dowdy dresser but her clothes were made by top dressmakers and these costumes were so badly made, ill fitting and puckered at the seams, so that at times, the sheer awfulness of her clothes distracted me from the story...but perhaps that was a blessing!"
3,Interesting,"Tom of Finland achieved iconic status in gay community. This film gives a rare opportunity to watch and listen to the mastermind behind the whole project, to find out how the comics were created etc.Whether you are a fan or not, I think it's worth to watch it."
5,A Finely Drawn Picture,"""Big Cicadas"" is a pleasant surprise that stays with you long after you finish it. It reveals its story through short vignettes that capture the feel of a life lived in a small Pennsylvania community in its many facets and through subtle imagery that allows the reader to see the characters both as they see themselves and as others see them. Nothing ponderous here! Just a great read."
5,ANY NIGHT'S ALRIGHT FOR W.A.S.P!,"W.A.S.P once again deliver another disc full of ""fun"" and ""entertainment"" for the price of admission.Remember those things? This band is very underated in my opinion as this CD will testify.Jammed packed with classic shock rock anthems this CD will give the curious an accurate idea of what this band is all about. I'd bet my bottom dollar that if W.A.S.P had been brave enough to record ""Saturday Night"" ten years ago it may have been the song to break them open to a wider audience. The material on offer here harks in the most to the supremo period being albums number one ""W.A.S.P"", and disc two ""The Last Command"" which should be your next purchase once you've absorbed the trax available here. THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE and THOROUGHLY RECOMMENDED!"
4,"Hello, everybody! Merry Christmas! I'll be there in two minutes.","This was the 1999 Christmas CD by LA based radio station KROQ and their poular deejays Kevin & Bean. As usual, it features a mixture of songs and comedy material. Unlike on some albums released by deejays, the comedy material is actually funny. Especially funny are: a parody of Bruce Springsteen's version of ""Santa Claus is Coming to Town"", Christmas songs sung wrongly by ""Karl Malone"" and Kevin bothering guys with stupid questions about Christmas while they are sitting on the toilet in the men's room at the mall. As for the songs, most of them are quite good, although the one by Korn is awful. The songs by Save Ferris and Blink 182 are great, but they are repeated from the previous year's CD, so points off for that. I liked most of the other songs, some of which are hard to find elsewhere. This is worth getting, if you can find it."
1,Nonsense,"Rather than my own summary, I am fine with this Publishers Weekly excerpt: ""During the Peloponnesian War (431-404 B.C.) between Athens and Sparta, Auria, a runaway slave girl, transforms herself into a warrior, healer, lyceum teacher, painter, ceramist, poet, songwriter and fiercely loving adoptive mother of an infant girl whom she rescues from a cave.""I like actual history in historical fiction. This is historical fantasy, shaded by (a subset of) today's mores... if that's your taste, have at it. Otherwise, move on."
4,Works great. Drips at connections.,Used for one season. Kept pool water perfect. Would deffinetly buy again. The valve that came with it for draining the filter leaked bad. Had to put a plug in it. Other conections drip.
5,Didn't think it was for me,"My husband brought this book home and I could not have been less excited: I'm a Cardinals fan (married to a Yankees fan, which is hard), and I didn't think I ever wanted to think (or read) about the 2004 World Series again. Then I started reading the introduction and felt this was the most amazing book about baseball ever written. It's poetic, gripping, and full of juicy information and so knowledgable and detailed at the same time. The two of us fought over it at night - and neither of us would have expected to read it (or enjoy it!) when we started. Some of the statistical information will seem common sense to fans (like explaining batting average) and some will seem obscure (like talking about ""defensive metrics"") but that's a tiny thing in a majestic book. I loved it!"
5,Feeding the Monster,"Could not lay the book down. A must for Baseball fans. The personalities are described in depth, sometimes shockingly so. It's a great follow-up to Moneyball, with the same system of recruitment playing a big part of this book also."
3,"Air Pistol, BB","This air pistol looks too much like a real pistol. I think it should be made to reflect a different look. As far as the operation, it has a trigger pull so hard it keeps the shooter from hitting a target. I am retired military and was a weapons instructor for years. Trying to squeeze the trigger on this pistol is extremely hard to do."
3,ok,"its ok but not too good it breaks quite easily but it can shoot a small copoperhead bb through perspex from 1 meter but it is very hard to load and cock every time you cock it you have to lift it up to let a bb run into the chamber, but you dont know it it has gone in so sometimes you load like 5 so if your serious about bb wars and want to be able to shoot more than 1 without having to refil then dont get it"
2,Fine when it's working,"Have had 2 of these. Seems to have fair enough distance and aim for this type of pistol. However, both of ours were very difficult to load - wished for a third hand. Then the front locked up and could not be loaded at all.Just threw away the second one, and it was only 2 yr. old and not used much."
5,"""It Rocks""",Mrs. piggle- wiggle is a really good book. It is amazing how she always has a cure for the parent's problem. I liked it when they was supposed to go for a hike and a picnic but it was raining. So they went to her house then she got them to search for treasure. This book is a really good book.
5,I like the book because it is interesting and funny.,"I like the book because it is interesting and funny, and if parents are having trouble with a problem like the one in the book they can try the same thing with their kids. I think Betty MacDonald is a very good writer. She has a very good imagination. I am eight years old."
4,Theresa Ann Savoy...,"... Rocks my world. I purchased this video only because of the deliciously beautiful Ms Savoy, who played the emperor's sister in ""Caligula."" The movie didn't dissapoint me as she frolics unashamedly throughout, however the film is a very disturbing look at a certain section of the Nazi government. Revisionists may disagree with the portrayal but I found it very realistic. Nothing they did surprises me anymore. Great film."
1,Artsy Fartsy. Didn't like this film,"Overated and expensive, More a work of cinematic art and softcore porn than anything else, a rather weak one."
3,Cologne or Eau d'toilette ? Bvlgari for men [pour homme],"I was told by commercial rep for national chain that Bvlgari provides three levels of this product line: Cologne [% higher of perfume content], Eau de toilette [ % perfume lesser than Cologne] but lasts thru 8hr exposure to air..and finally After-Shave class [highest level of alcohol w/ approx 2hr duration after exposed to open air]. The delivered bottle came in factory wrap with unopened cellophane pkg. This bottle in review, although accurate to Bvlgari specs, did not have mfg sticker with serialized ID on bottom of bottle or pkg. One can not tell which of the THREE product categories this delivery contained. Fragrance and strength closely matched AfterShave..but remains unknown. Buyer be-aware. I purchased another at national retail store and compared - side-by-side for above review."
3,Decent smell.,"This cologne is... okay at best. The cologne received raving reviews, but in my opinion the cologne has too much juniper base smell (reminding me of Gin), and has a more feminine scent. The cologne does last a long time (approximately 8 hours when applied to skin, not clothes).If i had smelled this in a department store before purchase i would not have purchased this on amazon.Other colognes i'm using:-gucci guilty (highly recommend)-Polo blue (highly recommend)-kenneth cole black (recommend)-armani aqua di gio (recommend, but everyone has it)-CK in2u (summer scent)-polo romance (love the smell when it's settled, would recommend)-bvlgari extreme (eh, so-so.)"
4,a pretty pleasant CD,"I am a big jazz fan and I love how Amazon.com finds great CDs for me to listen to in their recommendations section. This one does not dissapoint. It has kind of a mellow/pleasant tune to it. Here's a good way to describe it: when you go to... and sit down to read, this is exactly the sort of music you hear. It's uncanny how much it is like it! This cd's well worth a listen"
1,Takes major time to adjust to,"But it is quite imperfect. The tunes are blues-driven and okay, but rarely (except in Coma) are they inspired. So Stp make up for this the delivery right? Well, yes, the instrumentation is generally of a high quality, but there are still some awkward moments. I was cringeing as guitarwork at the end of the not-so-great Transmission from a loneely Room slowly faded out (and I hate fade-outs), only to hear it fade back in seconds later and finish later even more lamely. Geez. I like long metal songs, but Stp's bonking songs are just repetitive and exhausting, even if they are working with good material. Lyrically shangri is often excellent, sometimes even quotable (you know, ""looking California, feeling Minnesota""). The change of pace towards the end of WOnderful is brilliant, Too Cool Queenie is epic and monstrous, Holywood and Days of the Week are great too. Enjoyable, but not a great step forward for mankind"
1,STP goes Pop...,"What a mistake it was to buy this CD. This is one of those CD's that has 1 or 2 good songs on it. I was expecting the usual STP hard rock that made them famous, instead this CD is 90% ""STP does Pop music"". I wish I could take it back to the store...If you like Pop music, you may like this CD. If not, don't buy it..."
1,WHAT'S STPS EQUIVALENT TO A CLASSIC ROCK BAND?,"In terms of IMPACT, INFLUENCE and IMPORTANCE to the 1990s as compared to classic rock bands (though not musically similiar) this is how STP and the other artists of the 1990s stack up against 60s/70s band_________________________________________________________The equivalent of 90's artists to classic rock artistsPearl Jam = Led ZeppelinSoundgarden = Black SabbathRadiohead = Pink FloydAlice in Chains = the Doorsthe Smashing Pumpkins = the Beach BoysTool = The Velvet UndergroundNirvana = the Jimi Hendrix experience (in terms of impact, yea, although the guitar playing was obviously much different)And even though the White Stripes came later, the White Stripes would = the WhoAnd STP?Stone Temple Pilots = The Monkeesone star band. one star album. If you can skip the Monkees while searching for great 60's music, you can skip STP while searching for great 90's music."
5,"Fantastic music, don't put it in a category","I have to confess that I have always been a casual STP fan. While I enjoyed the songs on the radio I never went so far as to buy any of their albums. For some reason I was possessed to go get this one, and it is AMAZING. It is the best album released by anyone in the last 5 years. There are no bad songs on it, and they have so many different sounds. ""Coma"" is Nine Inch Nails-esque, ""Wonderful"" and ""Hello It's Late"" are Oasis/Radiohead type songs, ""Regeneration"" sounds like Jane's Addiction. These songs friggin ROCK. BUY THIS ALBUM. LISTEN TO IT OVER AND OVER AGAIN."
4,STP never fails...,"Stone Temple Pilots return with a lush, introspective album full of subtle hooks that grab you on about the third listen or so. Many genres are visited here, from full on hard rock to power pop to gentle acoustic ballads to heavy, swaggering juggernauts. Feelwise, this record brings to mind the tone and light-heartedness of ""Tiny Music"", the band's great third album.Weiland sneers on ""Dumb Love"", romps playfully through ""Days of the week, and croons lovingly on ""Wonderful"" and ""Song for Sleeping"". It's an album that shows growth, maturity, and evolution.It's a solid effort from one of the few original grunge bands that has survived and will continue to survive for years to come as long as they continue to release records of such expertise and honesty as ""Shangra-LA-DI-DA"""
2,Their worst album!,"There are a few good songs at the beginning, but it falls short of being a good cd. At least it sounds like STP, that's the best I can say."
4,JANIS JOPLIN REINCARNATED!,Not for the soft of heart...Beth Hart goes right to the bone with her bare naked lyrics & her soulful voice. I look forward to watching her grow in her career!
5,WHAT A VOICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Beth Hart has an AMAZING voice! Full of soul and passion, DARE i compare it to Aretha???I am SHOCKED by her AMAZING talent!!!!Songs like, ""Delicious Surprise"", ""Get Your Sh-t Together"", ""Favortie Things"" and ""LA Song"" are wonderful and colorful. She is amazing!A true talent, I wonder BREIFLY now why one EARTH wasn't she on the Lilith roster???????She beats some of them-don't get me wrong, I hold the utmost respect for the women-but Beth is ABOVE some of them!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
3,"a bit radio friendly, but...","With the songs Delicious Surprise, L.A. Song, Girls Say, ...and most of the tracks on this album, it seems Beth Hart is aiming for a successful career on top 40 radio... but all in all Screamin' For My Supper is a good album.Reccomended tracks: G.O.P., Stay, Skin, By Her, and the bonus track"
1,Misleading,"I just got this unit and must say that I am disappointed. It maybe because I was expecting it fully decode hdmi audio instead of having another optical in for the same source. So when I connect my PS3 I can not listen to full uncompressed audio in LPCM which is available only in hdmi. If you have only optical audio to take care of, you will be find with this receiver. But if you are looking at it just because it has ""HDMI"", beware and read the fine prints."
2,Had a very bad experiance,Bought this on the Black Friday from BestBuy as there was a great deal... had to return it as the left surround speaker connection was not working when hooked up.. also Front A speaker connections were not working...I went to exchange it.. but the other Receiver had the same issues when tested in the store... so returned this item and bought a Yamaha 5.1 Channel Receiver... it is working just great...I am not sure if the receiver itself is too bad or my luck :-)
4,Sony STR-DG510 Home Theater Receiver,The product is great and is value for money.Its designed for the latest HD technology. If for use with other HiFi bought 3 years ago the audio input selection jacks may not be enough.
4,Sony STR-DG510,"Nice receiver with hdmi hookups. Video to tv hookup is straight forward and easy. Audio is a different story. Does not decode the hdmi sound signal to the speaker system, only to the tv set. Still have to turn down the tv volume or else you have all sounds coming from the tv as well as the speakers. Sometimes a slight delay causes a small echo if not turned down."
3,Disappointment,"I purchased this receiver to replace my ten-year old Sony, which has been a superb receiver for my home theater. In a nutshell, it was a disappointing experience; the unit would not drive my Polk sub-woofer and the sound seemed tin-like, with an annoying echo. I couldn't find a sound field I liked with this one. I returned the unit to the store and will keep looking. I should have known - you get what you pay for. Would not recommend."
4,Good starter receiver,"As other reviewers said the HDMI's do not carry the audio. No issue for me, I used HDMI for video and optical for audio. For my first 5.1 setup this receiver is great. The sound is really good for the price. 500 watts more than fills the 15x20 viewing room. I have 3 way CerwinVega (12/4/2) in front / Mission bookshelf (6/6/2) in rear and Bose VCS-10 center. Setup was easy. Auto calibrate got me close. Still needs a little tweaking to get dialogue consistent. Navigating the menus is a little counter-intuitive but the unit came with a manual that is not bad. Someday I will buy a better receiver but until then I am very happy with this purchase."
4,Totally worth the price,"Hey, you get what you pay for. And it has HDMI inputs, which is something you usually don't see at this price point. The auto calibration mic actually works pretty well, and set speaker levels for my small room. The only drawback would be the lack of Coax digital inputs."
2,A shame,"This was a shame. I think supergirl is a cool character and can be done well, but this just makes clear that DC has no idea what to do with her. There is no characterization, no back up characters and the story can only loosely be called a ""story."" The art is cool and it seems that is all this book has to offer. It's a real disappointment, especially after Peter David's run on the previous Supergirl (linda danvers) which was excellent. Stick with Many Happy Returns, possibly the best supergirl story ever (along with Crisis on Infinite Earths)."
3,a fun read,over all I have to say that this was not one of the greatest stories of all time. Supergirl comes to earth and Clark is overprotective while Bruce is paranoid. everyone wants to get their hands on her and she is feeling isolated and angsty. it's been done. but here it is done well. if you have read the first batman\superman comic you wull know what to expect and it is done just fine. if you are not familiar with DC mythos you will be lost but the story is rather nice.over all: a fun read that is well done but not the greatest story ever told.
3,"good, overall","There are some fascinating recipes in here, and good information about vegetables that are usually ignored in cookbooks. Be aware, however, that this is a vegan cookbook--I personally was disappointed by this. I know that at least one recipe calls for pennyroyal, and I really don't think that using pennyroyal internally is a good idea at all."
2,Caveat Emptor,"Buyer beware! This Cd release by EMI/Capitol is a MONO issue. According to the liner notes and I quote "" Many of the solosists are completely off-mike....etc"". This from Michael Cascuna, a man who I admire for what he's done for Jazz. I acquired a mint Lp copy to replace my battered Cap Lp and the solosists are not off-mike in my opinion. My bet is they couldn't find the original stereo tapes or didn't want to bother to ""correct"" them. That's why they put knobs on equipment. So do as I did and get yourself a mint Lp and make your own Cd. And while your at it you had also better get a copy of ""Rendezvous With Kenton"" in stereo."
4,One of the better movies of Hong Kong cinema,"I really enjoy watching this movie...I can watch it over and over again. It is one of the better movies of the Hong Kong cinema. The story, the action sequences, the music are all done well. I recommend this movie to all who appreciate this genre."
5,Worthy Sequel,"This is a great sequel to The Bride With White Hair. Unlike what most people seem to think, this is one of the best sequels ever. Don't expect the same emotion and mystic throughout the film, but the end is just beautifull. So many Hollywood movies SHOULD NOT end with a happy ending(typical Hollywood) but I can't imagine this ending any other way. Watch it if you loved the first one. This is more for action fans but as I said, it lives up to The Bride With White Hair."
2,"A promising story, but a poor ending.","Mr. Baldwin has the makings of an excellent series in ""Canby's Legion"". There is a corrupt government, a distrusted ex-military caste, a conquered enemy, and pirates. However, Mr. Baldwin seemed to cut the story short and gave some simple, unsatisfying explanations to tie up all the lose ends. Disappointing."
4,Could Have Been Steamier,"Glad I purchased this movie.Enjoyed it immensely, great to glean an ancient view of male bonding.Didnt enjoy the lack of lighting in the film tho"
2,Lost it's steam,"I purchased this DVD and was looking forward to... I guote ""erotic, poetic, filled with romanticism"" There was very little interaction between Mehmet and Francesco.(two male stars) There was a very brief scene between them. If you're going to purchase this movie for poetic romanticism it wasn't there. The movie is very high quality as far as camera technique, and the scenery is excellent. The actors are all believable and well cast."
4,Magnificent film,"""Steam"" is yet another film (""American Beauty"" and ""Fight Club"") which examines our lack of fulfillment in conventional society. ""Steam"" sets itself apart by being life-affirming; though not a ""happy"" film in the American sense, it shows that happiness through pursuit of one's desires is possible.Those hoping to see an expensive porn movie will be disappointed, though it is not lacking in eroticism due to the superb acting (those stares!) and location."
3,Another take on George,"Refusing to believe that love permits control or perhaps distracted by his companion Mrs. Needleman, the man with the yellow hat once again disappears as George wanders unsupervised. This time, in a train station mired in mid-century stasis, George rearranges the trainmaster's board in a misguided attempt to help. In the end, George discovers that what it takes to be forgiven is good intentions and the quick wits to save someone's life. Unlike Vipah Interactive's spanking clean take on George, Martha Weston's looser, darker illustrations harken back to the original's feeling of big city grit."
2,Well ...,"The audio balance (or whatever it's called) on this recording is so awful, it kills whatever good is going on. The higher voices are clear and upfront enough, the orchestra - which thankfully is interesting and expressive - is VERY loud, the bass and baritone leads sound like they are singing as loudly as they can from back stage. I think Francesco Ellero d'Artegna (bass) and Nicolas Rivenq (baritone) might have voices too small for the parts anyway, but really it's hard to tell. I might recommend this only if you like Massenet and are not acquainted with mighty soprano Iano Tamar. Her diction is not clear but she is a sensual and fearless singer and I've come to like her very much. A better vehicle for her is I think the Pacini opera ""L'ultimo Giorno di Pompei"", another live recording from Martina Franca that is lovely in every regard."
3,Feeling a little mislead,"The food processor works wonderful and does everything it is supposed to do. However, it isn't 'chrome' like the description says it is. There is an actual chrome version but it is not this model - it is the larger model. This one is just plastic, painted a gray color to look like chrome. A little disappointing."
4,full montt,everything expected but think that should have all major actors interviewed. Is there a chance of a sequel to this film? Characters in lives now and or updated
1,Not as described,"This dvd was listed ""like new"" and the movie froze one minute before the end. That is not like new to this viewer."
1,"oh, what a high price :(((((","price is too high, so if rank will drop then price will be less :)))))))"
5,Finally,"a band that can play their instruments well, is heavy as hell, can actually write songs and make you think...without any gimmicks or acts..it's about time."
2,"uhh, kind of trashy","There's nudity, nuns, and murder but none of this is adds up to be very titillating."
2,"Not my favorite translation, for sure.","Nice to have a bi-lingual edition, but the translation lacks Baudelaire's musicality, which is too bad; because I mostly enjoy reading these out loud.I have found better translations online. There must be a better translation in print."
3,"OK, but not Great","This had some good recipes in it that I will probably use, and a few good tips, but most of the recipes were not for things that my family would eat--or that I would cook. Might be better to invest your money in a more all purpose type cookbook--UNLESS you have no concept of how to determine which recipes are frugal and which are not. Generally, think less meat, and more beans/grains/veggies. Still, it does contain some good information, and creative ideas, so if you don't have something like this already in your frugal arsenal, you might want to give it a try."
1,Terrible toffee,The toffee tasted like butterfinger bars... ok...if that is what one thinks toffee should taste like.. Very underwhelming.Dissapointed and will not buy this brand again
5,A writer's book,"This is a book about becoming real in a world of unreal people. Not many of London's regular fans liked this book, a little too real for them I suppose. But, writers love this book and with good reason. If you write and haven't read this, put it in your shopping cart right now. If you're looking for a classic Jack London adventure story, skip this one."
4,A-typical London,"I picked this up out of curiosity after a male co-worker raved about it being one of his favorite books in high school. The love story is extremely moving, as is Martin's determination to succeed, however at times London seems a little self-absorbed (the image of Cher slapping Nicolas Cage in ""Moonstruck"" comes to mind: SNAP OUT OF IT!!!); this did get a bit tiresome toward the end. It is definitely NOT the same Jack London I remember from school (Call of the Wild, etc), and that in itself makes it well worth the read."
4,YOU GO GIRL!,"i got this cd couple weeks ago,who could say this album is terrible?un,after read some review,some stupid pointS just because she is asian.even this album is not perfect but don't forget this is her first try and she did a GREAT job! no start is easy,COCO!YOU GO GIRL!love ya!"
5,"Didn't know what to expect, but was extrememly satisfied!","I read an unbiased article about CoCo in a magazine and since i have a taste for Asian music i decided to pick it up. Man was i impressed with it. The beats and her voice were BOTH fantastic. My whole family loved her style. My brother, cousins, and even my mom enjoyed the CD. She has a terrific voice with such a range. She has so much talent that I want her to be successful in the states so that more people in america can know what great talent and music is. I highly recommend it. Her songs are very catchy and stay fresh throughout the life of the CD. :P All of the songs were favorites, this has got to be my favorite CD among my collection. I was so impressed I even ordered her Asian CD's. I just can't seem to get enough of CoCo.. =)"
3,Above Average Pop,"While I know Lee's international reputation, I'd never heard any material by her previously. Fearing something unlistenable, as many international stars tend to be, I found Lee's ""Just No Other Way"" CD to be a listener-friendly blend of radio-accessible pop, R&B and dance. ""Can't Get Over"", featuring Kelly Price, is far-and-away my favorite cut, and ""All Tied Up in You"" is begging for radio release.Lee makes a nice, non-white addition to the genre dominated by blond neophytes like Jessica Simpson, Christina Aguilera, and Britney Spears. I'd say her sound successfully blends aspects of each of those. If marketed properly, there are any number of tracks on here that could be Lee's state-side ""breakthrough."""
1,I prefer her Mandarin songs,"I didn't buy this album, but I listened to it from my friend's CD. This is just boring pop music. If you're looking for an Asian singer who's trying to break into the U.S. market by singing English, try Hikaru Utada.Coco has the voice for Mandarin ballads/pop. Even people who don't understand Chinese rather listen to her Chinese songs. Her English songs are boring and lame....reminds me of Jessica Simpson's first album with those lame upbeat tracks (with the exception of ""I wanna love you forever,"" ""your faith in me,"" ""heart of innocence,"" and ""where you are."")"
1,My God! where is the creativity?,"Wow... as I express, I don't know what those song writers and singers are doing? Sampling others has been a trend that pretty much thumbs up our music industry thus far (Yeah. all you copy cats, you know who you are!) I find it very tiring listening to her music. First I have to be proud that she is first asian ever hit the U.S. market. BUT, I am so disappointed that she didn't do it with a BAM! She tries to hard to imitate artists like Mariah Carey, Celine Dion,and Whitney Houston. All the songs are pretty much the same from track 1 to track 10. (I gave it away the next day. I should've bought Best of Mozart! ) Please bring back the nuances!"
2,Great voice wasted of sub-par songs,"coco lee has a beautiful voice. too bad these songs stink. do you want my love is kind of catchy. but the rest just lacks something. this cdis too much like jessica simpson or chritina agulara, (two artists i would say coco is much better than). here is a tip from me to you: get exposed. its much better."
4,Not Bad,"I think this album is pretty good. I mean, if u really listen to her voice , she is pretty good. Don't judge her by the skin of color or anything like that. I mean, she is very talented."
1,Not Bad ..just not good either,"Plastic and Generic im so dissapointed in coco,....i was a big fan of her chinese songs, but this album is so generic and overproduced....4 songs on the album have the same title basically. and she trys to hard to be like Mariah carey"
1,Bad CD,"I think this CD ( )! Please do not purchase it!Flaws inCD! 1) bad lyrics - ""do you want my love"" ""baby want myman back"" 2) bad representation of Asian-Americans hair-dye poor taste in clothing 3) bad rapping for background music! keys are weak! 4) nothing to spectacular songs to general 5) please compare these songs to other American artists ; I'm sure you will not want to buy this CD 6) please buy other Sony artists! ( )"
2,Not for those with knee problems or most beginners of senior age,"I have been faithfully doing Basic Series 1 five to seven days a week for two months and like it very much. However, I thought I could use a little challenge so bought Basic Series 2 which in theory is just one step up from Basic Series 1. Perhaps Series 2 should have been named Basic series 2 1/2 as the poses were quite a bit more complicated and many really challenge the knee (a big problem area for me). Unlike Series 1, I did not find it that easy to follow the directions and had to keep looking up out of my bend or whatever to see what the pose was supposed to look like. Series 2 is more of a workout than Series 1 and though the running time is listed as 58 minutes, only about 50 of those are spent doing active poses. The last 8 minutes the students are lying on their mats in corpse pose and breathing deeply while Ms. Ward sits and looks solemnly at the camera."
3,"Passable Corbucci, but not among his best","This film is arguably better than NAVAJO JOE, but not nearly as compelling as HELLBENDERS, as creative and entertaining as COMPANEROS and MERCENARY, nor as sobering as THE GREAT SILENCE."
2,What a disssapointment,Wow I waited all this time for THIS - what was he smoking. Is this the new trend to try to be like Outkast and mix bad rock with hip hop.Come on Mos you can do better. This album is unlistenable and it almost pains me especially when I compare it to the first.3 out of 19 songs are just OKThe Easy SpellChampion RequiemLife is RealIt's too bad. He is going to have to come again in order to claim back his respect.The mystique is no longer
4,Rock on,"This is what rock and hip-hop should sound like. Everyone out there should take notice of this album. It should get 5 stars but then if it did Mos Def might as well give up. All the songs are pretty strong songs, some seem a bit more like jams instead of ""songs"" but man with people like Will Calhoun, Bernie Worrell, Dr. Know, and Doug Wimbish playing who cares. Noodle all day long. Next to Saul Williams, Mos Def is the best behind a mic out there. I have a philosophy that the first album by any group is going to be their best because it's still raw, left untouched by the publics opinions, but I am interested in hearing what direction that Mos and Black Jack Johnson go. ""The Rape Over"", ""Sunshine"", ""Sex, Love, and Money"", and ""The Easy Spell"" are my favorites."
2,its ok,this album was not what i was expecting. after black on both sides i was expecting another hot album but mos experiments alot on this album its kind of a let down. he needs to go back to his old style like on black star or black on both sides. this new mos isnt working for me
3,I thought wrong,"This is my first Mos Def purchase. Maybe I'm late or out of touch but I never knew who Mos Def was until Brown Sugar. I thought his rhymes were decent in that movie and then sometime later I heard the song ""What Beef Is"". That song is hot. Then, I saw him on The David Chappelle Show. At that point I knew I had to buy whatever his next CD was. I thought wrong. The cd is alright at times but I was looking for more...and not more rock and heavy metal. It's just not what I thought his music would be like...like I said, I thought wrong."
4,"Album Is Dope!! If you like The Mos Def, you will love dead prez music also. so check that out to!!","Like I said this is that real Soul Music right here and if you like this be sure to check out dead prez music as it is similar in a way as they all are very good friends as seen in chapelles block party. and if you in cali be sure to catch their first L.A. performance in 4 years as it will be hot!! May, 13 2006!! Straight From Chappelle's ""Block Party"" Dead Prez With Ras Kass, DJ Revolution Of Wake Up Show, KDAYS Icy Ice & More TBA.... 350 Pine Ave., The Vault 350...Long Beach, CA 90801....An Extremely Limited Amount Of Pre-Sale Tickets Available Now For On-Line Purchase @ www.thaformula.com & @ Your Local Record Shops"
5,Every Day All Day,"I applaud Mos Def for stepping outside the box. If you are open minded and like all types of music, this album maybe one of your fav's. If you are strictly a 'Rap Head' get ready for a surprise. I love the soul, I love the rock, I love the rap, I love the singing. This is what real ARTIST do."
1,New Danger should have been danger.,"Mos Def has produced great albums, but new danger is not one of them, this is utterly forgettable and predicable dud, featuring a plot on this album that is so ridiculous the songs are over the top, mos def singing and everything else is so preposterous, it makes KRS-One happy, I Hope he does a better album next time.New Danger Album Review * 1/2 Star."
1,Complete Garbage,"I like Mos Def's ""Black on Both Sides"" and the Black Star album, as well as some of his collabs with The Roots, Common, High & Mighty, ect...but this album is worthless. It's all pop slow jams that are boring and mundane. If you liked ""UMI SAYS"" from B.O.B.S. the most off that album, then this may be for you. But for Hip Hop fans and Mos' fans this will most likely dissapoint. The Rap-Rock doesn't fit his style, the love ballads get boring after the first 8 bars and everything else is just boring to me. As a HIP HOP fan I can't recommend this album, but I do give him credit for having the cahonies to experiment."
2,not that Dangerous,"""When i purchased this album i wanted REAL HIP HOP not this mix of rock/hip-hop style that mos def has choosen to use. To me this was just a marketing gimic used to expand fan base. To me Mos def is one of the most talanted men in HIP HOP .... I wish he showed his skillz on this album."" -- Originally posted by KevinI TOTALLY AGREE."
1,Did Mos forget how to rap?,"I really don't know what he was thinking. I was a huge fan of the blackstar album, and black on both sides, but this was totally ridiculous. If I wanted minute-long intros to every track, I would have bought the Yanni CD. Mos should be sticking to his strong point (hip-hop) and not this garbage."
1,the new rubbish,its a good thing i downloaded this for free. because aint no way in hell i'd buy it.
3,Creativity,"I have to say that I wasn't really surprised that Mos Def decided to do something different on his 2nd solo release. I really enjoyed some of the tracks but I was also quick to skip some of the tracks on here. I applaud the fact that a hip hop artist pushed his boundaries and added something new (added alot of guitar and rock elements) to his style. However there are plenty of bands out there in the rap-rock genre that do it better. Hed PE, Rage Against the Machine, The Red Hot Chili Peppers, 311 and Linkin Park to name a few. Still Mos Def is a beast on the mic and has some amazing lyrics and that is where he shines. I mean if you saw him on Chapelle show when they were cruisin down the street in the car and he was jus freestylin to the scenery and stuff off the top of his dome....you know not many can touch him. As for this album I give it a 3 ....half the songs are good...half the songs ain't."
3,Not good for some tubs,"The toy is great but it won't stick to our spanish tile because it is rough and porous. If you have a porcelin wall or tile that is flat and shiny, it'll work for you. I still let my daughter float around with the mirror in the tub and she loves the seahorse that holds her shampoo."
2,Well,"I really didn't notice Elmo on the package? These are for kids more than adults. Nothing wrong with flavor, but priced for kids that scream alot."
2,2 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:A rather tepid thriller that wastes a quietly interesting performance by Kate Winslet, Enigma follows a bored Dougray Scott through a pedestrian series of events--look elsewhere."
2,Just Doesn't Gel,"Any movie in which the star spends his penultimate scene explaining what's been happening, is in trouble. Humphrey Bogart managed it in ""The Maltese Falcon,"" but Dougray Scott is no Bogart. As a leading man he lacks just about everything. I caught this film on TV after the opening credits had rolled and didn't recognize Kate Winslet until her name showed up at the end. The plot comes at you from every point on the compass: Britain, Russia, Germany, Poland, America; but basically it's about a German spy working inside the code-breaking team in the UK during WW2. You're left at the end with more or less a big ""Huh?"""
3,Fix is in,Columbia TriStar has released a new version of this DVD that addresses the incompatibility with Philips and Toshiba DVD players. Contact your DVD vendor for details.
3,"Excellent film, poor transfer","This is a literate and well acted thriller, every bit as good as the 5 star reviewers say, but the DVD quality is terrible - it looks almost as bad as a VHS transfer. almost enough, but not quite, to make us return it...2 stars deducted."
2,Historically Inaccurate Farce,"Watch ""Enigma"" to kill some time, but don't hold on to the presentation as history. The real story of the Nazi code-breaking team and Alan Turing must be too controversial for a film. ""Enigma"" goes beyond taking creative license -- it rewrites history right down to the persona of the lead character. Consider it ""loosely inspired"" by the facts. A well done and well filmed piece of fiction nonetheless."
4,"Good flick, slightly inaccurate historically","I hate to be picky..but the Enigma system was a stream cypher, NOT a code. A code encyphers the same item ""battleship"" say, in a finite number of ways. Eventually they repeat. The Enigma system would NOT repeat (in less than many years). That was it's strength. The movie publicises a little known, and scarcely appreciated part of WW2. Perhaps a major reason why we are not speaking German now. In my opinion: well written, convincingly acted, somewhat unkind to the Poles (who provided invaluable help to the Allies with their cryptographic skills - and were shabbily treated as a reward), but well worth a look. More historically accurate material is available from the Bletchley Park site for those interested in persuing cryptanalysis more deeply. Cheers.."
3,Old Fashioned Movie,"Not a lot of cursing and carrying on in this movie. A bit slow, but good for a Sunday Afternoon."
3,"The First Eat, Pray, Love","Liz T. as free-spirit Laura Reynolds may have succumbed to too many post-joint munchies, but oh, that face.And then there are those magnificent canyons -- errrrr, I mean that craggy Big Sur coastline.Decades before Brangelina, the Burtons were ""the couple."" One can only imagine the tenderness as they brushed the beach sand off each other.Sure, the movie has its flaws, but they are easily forgiven, now that Burton and Taylor are gone. Oh, how we want to remember the way they were. ""E"" and ""R"" scrawled in the sand, forever."
3,Love still goes on,"This movie has remained with me long after seeing it for the first time. I even found the soundtrack in a local Record store.When I hear the great song Shadow of your smile I find myself sad that Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton's love didn't survive in this romantic movie. Then I stop to think and say ""wait a minute they had many more years of love at its best in real life, it did survive"". Not the greatest script but a memorable experience to watch just the same."
1,The only kids book I hate,"This book is so weird, and in a creepy way. The illustrations are creepy, the story is strange and best I can describe it is ""artsy"". It actually perturbs me just hearing it when my wife reads it to my son. It's the only book I've asked as a favor for her to not read around me. But she liked it growing up, and my son doesn't mind it (although he doesn't like it), so obviously many will differ with me."
3,Gets the job done,"It is nice, light-weight, and durable, but you can't put a drink from a restaurant in it. It's way to flimsy for that. That's why you only see bottles in the pictures. Other than that, no complaints."
3,So/So,"This is an OK item wtih some limited functionality. The cup holders, as noted, are small and only really fit the *slender* water bottles. Forget about trying to jam that 20oz Diet Pepse yor brought along. The pack that holds all your junk is great. I usually tosst the keys, cell phone and anything else I might have on me in there. Between this and nothing really else offered by the company, this is OK and usalbe, however we still got some of the plastic cup holder's to attach by the rider for the sippy."
2,Eh.,"Love my Volo, don't quite love this thing. I am keeping it and not returning it only because it was only $12, and it IS nice to have some extra storage to stash my keys and cell phone when running errands.However, the cup/bottle holders are pretty much useless... which is the primary reason I bought this. Don't even bother trying to use them unless you have a roll of papertowels handy. I'm not sure I could even fit an Avent wide-neck bottle in there, I think the only ones that would really fit would be the tall/skinny bottles. Bummer.ETA: After a recent mall outing, where I spent most of the time reattaching the velcro straps to keep this on or moving it out of the way to access the basket, I decided to send it back. Definitely pass on this one."
4,Over and over...,This is my second CD. I got one as a gift. I play it every night for both of my little ones. I played it so much I think we kind of wore out the first. The songs are very pleasant and it has just kind of stuck as one of our routine things.
5,Big Blue Is Spectacular,send me an email if you need this movie. i have a couple (syberbob@earthlink.net)
1,How very...French,"A long boring movie with an annoying ending. Some of the photography was good, and seemed to have more character than the characters.Avoid this movie at all costs!"
2,Really really LONG,"If you love this movie, then you should get the Director's Cut, because there is lots more movie to love. I bought this for my husband who said it was one of his favorites from when he was younger, and when we watched it he couldn't remember why he loved it so much other than the beautiful cinematography. I thought it was very ""French"" in that ""ooookkkaaay, what was the point?"" kinda way. But what do I know, I'm just a typical boorish American. ;o) Anyway, it was eternal and I'd rather watch HD's Sunrise Earth for three hours than watch this again."
1,Good scenery..,"I don't know why everyone loved this movie so much. Yes, the scenery was great but I found the dialogue and performances to be absolutely terrible! I also have to agree with the reviewers who did not enjoy the music. Not having heard anything about this movie previous to watching I went in with an open mind and came out horrified (and bored)."
5,This movie is something special.,"I purchased the video version when released in U.S many years ago. I saw this movie on the big screen back in 1988 or 89 and was just consumed by the story and the photography and musical score. I cant wait to see the DVD directors cut, Ive been waiting for 12 years now, I KNOW IT WILL BE GOOD!!!Well I purchased the DVD and have been disappointed, yes...The musical score that is included in the United States is not the same as in Europe. The U.S. score is much better imo and better fits the stories emotional scences. This directors cut is the european version...the movie itself was nice to see and the additional minutes enlightened me on some questions i had of the characters...now if they would just put the U.S. release soundtrack it would be a winner all the way around......"
5,Nobility & Passion at the Bottom of the Ocean,"What two things are most admirable in men? If not nobility and passion then nothing at all. I have never seen a film that portrayed this axiom better than the Big Blue. The film has an emotional range comparable to Whitney Houston's vocal chords. From the opening shot of a flight across the Mediteranean to the heart wrenching decision made by Jaque at the bottom of the sea, the movie takes you on an emotional rollarcoaster you choose not to forget.Quite honestly, it does my soul good to read these reviews and realize so many others were touched in the same way. By something as simple as a movie!I also am impatiently awaiting the VHS release of this movie. I'm tired of getting those annoying phone calls from the video store asking me to return my copy of the movie, which is only 5 years late."
5,Mastery of the underwater cinema! Takes my breath away!,"Luc Besson has taken a wonderful idea to it's max! Underwater cinematography at its' best! I use this film as inspiration in teaching children to swim, to use their bodies in the water as if they were dolphins, and control their mind, body and spirit! Lovers of the sea, enjoy!!"
5,"Enchanting, the best film ever!!!!!!","The Big Blue truly is one of the best films ever made. A culmination of cinematagraphy, and wonderful screen play by the actors. This film needs to be re-released, for it truly was ahead of its time. Lets see this one on DVD!!!!!!Great to see so many wonderful reviews on MY FAVORITE!"
5,in my opinion,"great movie, very hard to find. This movie was like new in a great case. Thankyou very much."
2,TOO GOOD A MOVIE TO DISAPPOINT US FANS,Luc and Theatrical Company - Please give us Americans who adored the English theatrical release with Bill Conte's haunting and beautiful music a break. I showed this film to all my marine bio students for years on VHS and laser disc.... we would swim to the abyss for this version on DVD .....................please do it for us and the dolphin in all of us !
1,What happened to the music!?!?!?!?,"I too, like many, loved the original soundtrack (Bill Conti) I recently purchased the DVD with great anticipation and was sadly disappointed. I was unaware that there were two different soundtracks. I found the Eric Serra score to be intrusive and overbearing. I own two of the VHS with the original score and I suppose I will have to get a VHS player again so I can enjoy this wonderful movie. Please reconsider before purchasing a DVD version of this film. If you loved the movie when it was released you will probably not enjoy the DVD edition."
2,sonically incorrect,"I am sorry to say that the Director's Cut of The Big Blue was very disappointing, sonically that is. I bought the movie on DVD to enjoy the marvelous Luc Besson masterpiece and later realized that all the music was changed. A different score was apparently written and used in this version. I loved the music from the original, which Eric Serra originally composed. I would like to know if you can buy the DVD with the original soundtrack, otherwise I am returning my DVD and finding an old VHS. I'd like to see the new DVD include the original score. Great movie, its too bad the musical score was changed."
4,Good Director's cut ~ Better American version,This is one of those rare cases where I believe the American version is much better than the European. I could do without some of the superfluous scenes such as the oil rig scene....It just doesn't fit. While Eric Serra's score is haunting and beautiful I feel that Bill Conte's score is more appropriate for the content. And the European ending does not settle as well as the American version.....Jean-Marc Barr swimming into the distance. WHERE'S THE AMERICAN VERSION ON DVD??????? The Professional/Leon is available in the American and European version on DVD???
4,Good book for those Internet support projects.,"I was in a pinch. The client wanted automatic downloads of files from a web site AND an ftp site. What to do? I grabbed a copy of this book and got to it.This book was an excellent resource for me to get started in Wininet programming. The only warning I will give about the book is that there is only one small chapter on using Wininet with VB. However, the conversion for basic funtionality is fairly simple and if you are this far, chances are good that you will be using C++ anyway."
3,Worked well as a replacement but can be noisy,"Tightened up the vehicle but make sure to use the proper grease, as without it they can be quite noisy."
3,Decent commercial comeback,"This is a nice album, but I'm not a huge fan of this kind of production. The melodies are strong, give SAW that! It's late 80's techno-pop, but like I said the melodies are nice and there's some very good tunes here. My favourite is Breakaway. Donna's voice isn't the same as it was in her earlier career, it's changed a bit, it's deeper. This is good music."
1,False description,"The description says 100% cotton, but the tag on each of the two pairs of shorts I received (different colors) says 50% polyester/50% cotton, and this is what they appear to be. Since Amazon.com cannot get the description right for a pair of shorts, I guess I cannot trust any of their descriptions. For an online retailer, this is serious, given the hassle involved in returning an item."
2,Oversized and overly thin material,When ordering I would suggest you consider a size smaller than what you generally wear. Not having a product specific size chart available here does not help. My poor rating is more influenced by the fact that the cloth used is quite thin and does not look like it will hold up to regular wear beyond a few months. Will post an update on the shorts longevity in around six months.
2,Russel shorts,"I liked them at first, but I use bleach often around the house, and the color doesn't hold up. Now they are a mess."
2,What you get is a crap shoot,"These were advertised as 100% cotton. Some of them i received were and others were partly cotton and partly synthetic material. I love the all-cotton ones, but the hybrids I don't. Too bad you can't get what you order. Buy at your own risk."
1,NOT Russell quality I've come to expect,I've bought these shorts for years and used them as pajamas and for lounging around the house.I will be giving the three pair I just bought to charity.The fabric feels much lighter/scratchier/cheaper than my current pair. They are also about three inches longer. Embroidered logo is now an iron-on.
3,Really Really BIG!,"I am not a small guy, but these would be loose on a pregnat elephant. Waist is huge, legs are long. If you need a ego boost these are for you."
2,Sizing changed,"Sometimes the XXL were a little confining while exercising, so I tried these in XXL. They were HUGE!!! I washed them in hot water a few times and they are still way too big. I then ordered XXL which were the original size I wore and they too are way too big. I haven't lost enough weight to account for the size change. It seems Russell has once again started to screw with their sizing. It may get to the point that I quit buying their products, online anyway."
3,Pretty OK,"I got these shorts to wear casually in hot weather and for occasional duty as sleep wear.The good news is that they are comfortably loose without being saggy baggy. The fabric is lightweight without seeming flimsy.The not so good is that the stitching seems sub par. One of the pockets developed a hole after two washings and no rough wear.I got the shorts in black heather. In real life the color looks more like charcoal gray. At the time I ordered the shorts the description wasn't clear on the fact that this color is a polyester/cotton blend. I would have preferred all cotton, which is available in some of the solid colors. I'm not losing sleep over the matter, though. Just be aware that different colors come in different fibers."
2,flimsy,these are just way too flimsy........the thread comes loose after a wash....the seams are not strong at all. not happy.
5,A gift from Jewel,"Jewel delivers beautiful Holiday music on this CD. 'O Holy Night', 'Silent Night', 'Hark the Herald Angels Sing', and 'Ave Maria' are especially lovely. The new version of 'Hands' is gorgeous and inspirational. 'Go tell it on the Mountain' and 'Winter Wonderland' are two fun and upbeat songs. The only track I didn't like was 'Rudolph.' This CD had not left my case, and if you buy only one holiday CD this year, this should be it."
4,Smooth Young Voice,"Coming from a family filled with doctorates in music, opera singers, etc., I tend to listen with a critical ear to other vocals. Even so, I was very impressed with the vocals of this smooth young voice. Jewel obviously has had some training and a natural talent for Christmas music as well as Pop. Congratulations on a job well done!"
5,Great cd,"I never listen to country..... I don't even like it! However, I love Jewel. She one of the best singers I've ever listen to. I wish I could sing like her. You'll love the song Winter Wonderland. I highly recomend this cd (even if you hate country like me)along with all of her cd's. Her music is for everyone! ..... Jewel if you read this Good job keep up the good work. You bring a lot of smiles to a lot of faces:)"
1,Why?,I think Jewel has the creative capacity to engage in something more challenging than this economic enterprise to cash in on Christmas.
5,A Variety of styles with all the beauty of Jewel,"In the flavor of her current hit album ""Spirit"", Jewel offers us many Christmas Classics with a tradition yet personal flair. A remake of Hands at the end of the Album seals us with a kiss."
4,"Great, but not quite perfect.","This is a really good albumn. You MUST hear ""O Holy Night"" - what a feminine, beautiful rendition; Jewel's voice is fantastic. As mentioned in other reviews, ""Hands"", ""Ave Maria"", and ""Face of Love"" are excellent. But I didn't like the version of ""Rudolph"", and ""Go Tell it on the Mountain"" is cute - but for the holidays?"
1,Not the greatest,"This video covers far more about Diana, and her impact on William, then it does about William. I was extremely irate to learn that nearly the whole video is slanted towards Diana, and against HRH Prince Charles, who I think is doing a very good job at being a father. Very little actual footage, and some of that it repeats. Mostly its all commentary from people who supposedly know all about him (and his mother). I was extremely disappointed. The front cover displays a picture taken on his 18th birthday at Eton, and with all the press footage taken that day, none of it is in the video. Its copyrighted 2001, and yet most of it is during his growing up years. The only relatively recent shoots that make the video worthwhile are brief moments taken from his first press conference, the Queen Mum's 99th birthday, and the christianing of his godson. Thats about it, otherwise, it wasn't anything I couldn't have learned anywhere else."
3,Good sampler with a few excellent hits,"There is some fine music on the samper and then there is some not so fine music. The standouts include the Coleman's, Claire's Audience, ESP All-Stars, Household Name and of course Puller. It's a quite a mix of music sounds from alternative to punk and even to space rock. Put out by 6x6 records it gives a good overall sample of some up and comers in alternative Christian music."
2,You'd have to be there,"A Chorus Line is one of those musicals you have to see to believe. It's all about visuals.This CD is nice for those who saw the show, however, there is only about two songs that are worth listening to if you can not relate to what is going on.On it's own, this CD barely floats for entertainment value."
4,Very Satisfied,"I think these sound great, and the sound quality is very good. They are wonderful, and very comfortable, on airplanes.My only gripe is that, even when folded flat, they are kind of big, and the carrying case is bulky."
1,Broke after one day,"Everything about this product was great, until the swivel mount broke after one day's use, despite treating them very carefully. When I called Logitech to arrange a refund, the customer care rep told me there had been several similar problems in the last few days. Logitech could not have been more helpful, and are giving me a full refund. Delivery from TigerDirect also good."
2,Good noise suppression but cable connection was flawed,"Cable connection flaw meant you could only hear anything you connected to the headphones through one ear pad and even then the volume didn't go above a whisper. When you pushed the cable end a bit harder into the receptacle on the headphones you heard full sound but the cable connection slipped out and couldn't be made to stay in. Wearing them as noise suppressors worked well on a 1 hour 20 minute plane ride, but there was too much pressure against my ears for it to feel comfortable. I had to return the item."
2,Buyer Beware - A Beginner's Guide packaged as an Exam Guide,"There certainly is a growing market for exam guides; unfortunately many publishers are repackaging their existing Beginner's Guides to try to fill the void. This book is an EXCELLENT guide for someone wanting to become a DBA, or to fill the gaps in their own experiential database. The downside is that this book will NOT prepare you for the exams - in fact, it doesn't even come close. Cheers for a easy-to-read book, but Jeers for misleading the buyer."
2,CD-ROM Test Software Useless,"The content is reasonable. There are a large number of step-by-step processess with screen shots, which I consider filler.The self-test software on the CD is unusable. It has blank questions. There are also multiple-choice questions that should use checkboxes, but use radio buttons, resulting in only being able to choose one answer. If you happen to choose the first right answer, the answer is scored as correct even though you didn't answer the others.I'd like to get my money back for this book and buy a better one.I hope this review prevents others from falling into the same trap as me.Good luck with your certifications!"
2,"An Upbeat, Fast-paced Fantasy","Although I enjoyed the loyalty of the characters, and the comical acts put on by the evil Queen Tsarmania, this book wasn't quite my type. It is totally a ""just for fun"" book, as in the fact that you don't exactly glean a lot from reading it other then some humorous moments. Also, the characters are so plainly black and white, good or bad, making it very fairytale/folktaleish. Although I'm glad I got a taste of this type of literature by reading this book, I don't think I'd read another in the series. Give it a try though!"
3,Read it for Tsarina's tantrums,After reading Redwall I was hoping for greater insight into Martin's history. Mossflower though it introduces Martin it doesn't come close to filling in the back story in any coherent fashion. The only really entertaining bit of it is Tsarina's tantrums. She's portrayed wonderfully as a mad cat queen.
5,An adventurous aminal tale.,"If you like action, suspence, and adventure, this book has it all. I gave it five stars because it's very well written and excitting. You should read it! I'm trying to read the whole series."
5,A great book!!,"I loved this book! It was full of excitement and adventure. The plots are complicated and the book is long, but I never got bored with it. It has great descriptions and makes you feel close to the characters. I have read it multiple times, and every time I read it I find it exciting. I can't put it down once I start reading. It takes unexpected turns and twists that keeps it gripping. Brian Jacques is a great writer, and has written several other books in the Redwall series. I hope he continues to write more Redwall books."
5,The Adventure continue,This is the action packed sequel to Martin the Warrior as well as a prequel to Redwall and it's squels. The story starts a few year after the events in Martin the Warrior. Martin is no an adult. Venturing into Mossflower woods he is captured by vermin solders. He is taken to Kotir where he meets the mean but nice wild cat Verdog Green Eyes. His cruel power hungry daughter Tasmara and his son Ginverel. The ancestor of Squire Julian Ginverel from Redwall.He is thrown in the dungen and during the ecounter Tsamra breaks martins father sword in half. Later during the night Green eyes dies from being posion buy her daughther. After Ginvere is locked up Martin loose hope.Vile Tsmara is rule she determine to establish and reign of death and terror. Later he meets after friend a funny plumb fat mosue name Gonff Prince of Mouse
5,Awesome Redwall Prequel!,"This book was the perfect prequel to Redwall. I loved the plot, the characters, and the layout. This is the 5th Redwall novel I own and I plan to collect the entire series due to this book. It is very pivitol in the series. It is a must have in the Redwall series."
5,The BEST REDWALL YET!!,"This book was incredible. How Martin the Warrior fights the wildcat Queen to the end is just wonderful! ""Your father made a just decision, but yours was the right one. You should have killed me when you had the chance, because I vow that I will slay you one day!"" Right when you read that your body shivers a little! Isn't wonderfull!!!!!"
4,Cruisin' with Clapton,"I think this is one of his better earlier CDs. Although there are no rock 'em sock 'em tunes, songs such as ""Roll It"", If I Don't Be There By Morning"", ""I'll Make Love To You Anytime"" and others still allow you to have a rockin' good time. It's an excellent CD to listen to when exercising or working outside. The only problem is you like it so much it makes you stop to listen. To me, that's the quality every good music CD has. Buy it. You won't be disappointed."
2,Weak recording with 2 or 3 good tracks,"I read a rolling stone review of this album back when it came out and it was the most hilarous thing I've ever seen! Something about this album being a non-entity and that Clapton records the transference of a cigarette from one hand to another and its 10th rate Fleetwood mac and that the band sounds like a hawaiian karoake performance. It's pretty lame - weak and his vocals go out of tune. Tulsa time, Watch out for lucy, and promises are about all there is here - the rest of it can pretty much go away. Golden ring is his attempt to create another wonderful tonight and it falls short. Skip it."
5,The best Latin grammar!,"This is the best Latin grammar out there, I have 6 different Latin grammars and I just wished I had found this sooner. If you enjoy Latin and want the most in-depth learning tool, get this, the price is high but completely worthy. If you are studying just because you have to, perhaps the best option would beLatin Via Ovid: A First Course Second Edition, which is more fun and lighter, but not so complete."
5,Great movie actually based on the book...,"I saw the movie before I read the book. I liked the classic tale based around the turn of century (the book was published in 1910). I liked the story and the cast picked for the parts were chosen well. When I read the book, most of the film followed the book with minor differences but captured the major posts in the book but nonetheless the settings, people and events were done well..."
3,DISCONNECTEDNESS,"I still don't know what to make of this film. In my heart I think it was average, although I am sure that somehow it was better than that. Or maybe because everyone else loved it so much, I am led to believe I should too. Despite the stellar performances of Helena Bonham Carter, Emma Thompson and Anthony Hopkins, I cannot really say that the plot made me jump for joy. I am not a big fan of these period dramas courtesy of the Merchant-Ivory team, so this may account for my bias. Maybe I should see it again, but in the meantime I can only say that the film went on too long for my liking (or at least seemed like it did) and never quite hit home for me."
2,Nice to look at is all,"Beautiful scenery, nice costumes, great acting, and handsome people, without a good storyline do not a great movie make."
3,Well made -- but the movie drags.,"As always, superb acting by Hopkins and Thompson. The story is a good one, however the movie leaves the viewer in wonder of what is realling going on for much too long. I almost gave up after a while, but got back into it about half way. In the end I was rather dissapointed, left with a ""that's it?"" kind of feeling. Overall a well made movie, but i'd recommend Remains of the Day over this feature."
3,Pedestrian and dispiriting,"I found this film really hard going and ultimately dispiriting - perhaps this is more a reflection of my own interior state. None of the characthers seem to have any joy in their lives - they were all kind of drifting along in an aimless way, so it seemed to me."
2,Not Emma's Best,"and not really Anthony's, either. I borrowed the VHS from a friend anticipating a lovely, two-hour or so film with rich, well-developed characters, beautiful scenery, and a riveting storyline. I guess one out of three's not bad.Howards End promises a lot but underdelivers. With Emma Thompson, Sir Anthony Hopkins, and Helena Bonham-Carter in the lead roles, one expects a more interesting film or at the very least, an exciting climax. One gets neither. This film plods along for over two hours, much like an overworked carthorse stumbling through the English countryside. By the end, all one wants is some oats and a night's sleep in the barn. What disappointed me most was Bonham-Carter's performance. She is much better at edgy hysteria than what she shows here.Even the climax was dull. (In case you still want to see this film, I won't give it away.)In this reviewer's opinion, if you want a good Merchant Ivory flick, watch A Room with a View instead."
2,Outdated information,"This book is too pragmatic. It doesn't leave any room for creativity whatsoever. I found it to be rather boring and it may have worked for him, but most agents are not going to dock you for some of the trivial details. If you are trying to submit your work to an agent and publisher for consideration, this book will make you angry and frustrated."
3,"If you are selling a novel, this is not the book for you.","I laid down my coin on the assumption that this book would help me with writing a book proposal for a novel - before the ""look inside"" feature. The title is misleading, even though the author tries to appeal to novel writers by sprinkling the concept around like glitter on a greeting card; it does not have any real substance. 2 stars for that.Great book for non-fiction as it gives insight into how agents and editors think and perceive their end of a book proposal.If I ever write a non-fiction book, this is one of the books I will study. 5 stars for that."
2,More atmosphere than substance,"The most distinctive thing about this album is the cover design, which reflects the fact this was a compilation of two different live sets: one, a standard jazz set featuring his trio; the other an expanded line-up venturing into Cal Tjader territory, with acoustic guitar (Eddie Duran, who doesn't take any solos here but keeps the Latin groove chugging along) and some heavy-handed percussion.The sound quality isn't great, but in a way this adds a kind of documentary flavour to the proceedings - snapshots of typical club sets somewhere in late 50s/early 60s San Francisco when Latin and pop jazz was ubiquitous in venues such as the ""Blackhawk"" or the ""Hungry i"".But I can't help wondering if the original LP was little more than a quickly-issued follow up to Guaraldi's suprise hit, Cast Your Fate To The Wind (a.k.a Jazz Impressions Of Black Orpheus), such is the triviality and brevity of some of these tracks."
5,10 stars!,"I wanted to add some intelligent thoughts about this recording, but others here have said it all. This is the single greatest recording in any genre that I have ever experienced.My only regret is that you can only have one experience of hearing the Koln concert for the first time and feeling that you have discovered why God endowed humans with the ability to create music."
5,True music,"If I had one piece of music only to listen to the rest of my life this would be it. It would be one of the greatest performances of all time, the fact that it is improvisational makes it all the more stunning. Nothing touches truer to my emotions than this work."
2,All surface,"The playing on this album is pretentiousness masquerading as profundity. Jarrett can set a nice groove, but then he simply falls in love with it, and self-indulgently persists to a point where I want to scream ""Get off of it!"" He tosses in some pretty decorations along ther way, and a few shouts and grunts now and then to show us how moved he is by this music, but it all adds up to an immensely forgettable experience."
1,Where's the Jarrett I know?,"I don't know what people find in Koln Concert. There's only one riff I remember that resembles the beautifully melodic, inventive and fluid improvisations worthy of the reputation that surpasses Bremen + Lausanne. I was expecting something better than B+L because of all the hype but I can't stand to hear the CD and I can't stand to throw out music. But I never listen to it because I can't really stand it."
5,Wonderfully touching...,"It reminds me of soft sunny afternoons. The music is sentimental and warm. It's become a luxury for me to sit for long teas, gazing out of the window while listening to this CD. (esp the first part.) I listened to it over 50 times & it's never bored me still. Great one. Even my friends loved it."
2,Disappointment.,"This cd contains four improvisations played at the Köln concert.Keith Jarrett has an impressive discography going from Bach to Pärt, not to mention his own compositions. So you expect some amazing improvisations but it's a disappointment.Slamming the same chords for minutes on end with only slight differences in the high tones is not my idea of an improvisation"
4,Good music!,I like the consert and its variations of sound. It is rare to hear musicans reaction to his work.
3,A disappointing sequel,"Having enjoyed Kidnapped very much, I wanted to read the sequel too but found it rather tiresome in the end.The beginning and and ending are pretty good, and the characters are well-developed, but the author seems to be fabricating and drawing out the tension in rather contrived ways for nearly the entire book. The hero's foolishness gets him and Catriona into an awkward situation, at which point her highly unlikeable father comes on the scene and makes the final chapters very tedious reading."
4,"Really good info, but a little dry","I enjoyed some of the information presented in this book, but overall the writing style was rather dry and not very engaging. I would recommend this book to someone who wants to study more in depth about this subject, but that has the patience to wade through the areas where it tries to put you to sleep."
1,Do not purchase,"This book was a complete waste of time and money. It not only lacks direction, but it appears that Tim Winton was unsuccessful in even figuring out the point of his own story. This was the first book I read of his - and definitely the last. I didn't even manage to get through the book before it was turned into something more useful - such as a recyclable item!"
2,Nothing to Brag About,"Only 25 contracts, VERY basic with no detail. Looks like somebody made this at home in their spare time. I was not impressed by the ""software"" included either. Didn't feel like any of these contracts were ""professional"" enough. I think I could have copied these out of the back of a Music Business book. The work for hire contract is a waste of time. Should have called a lawyer and put the 50 bucks toward his contract drafting fee."
5,added to my collection,"I liked the fist paperback version so I decided to buy this one too, I use to travel a lot with my band and carrying large books after me was not something I desired. The cd-rom version can be accessed from anywhere there's a computer, this makes it incredibly versatile, I was able to print a contract at an airport Pc terminal if you can believe it"
5,wow,"These contracts helped me out of a big mess with my boss last week and that is because of the speed they give me when filling out paperwork I had a large operation going that was running late and purchasing this bundle helped me iverome this hurdle.So if you want speed and effectivenes buy this suite because the contracts are golden and they updated on a regular basis, the print is clean and clear and next to each contract you'll find a full explanation on how to fill the columns correctly"
4,Nokia Boom Headset,This is a very good product for my needs. It is the only headset I have found that works with the Vonage UTStarcom wifi phone. I would recommend this product - especially to Vonage users.
5,This book is very truthful,"I was in religious life for six years during the 1990's. My experience is that about 50% of the Catholic clergy are ""gay"" and many of then actively so. Yes, there is a ""Lavender Mafia"" in the Church. It is widespread and extends to very high levels. Within it the gay lifestyle is the ""god"" that is promoted and defended at all cost.In this book what I experienced in religious life is clearly reflected. The gays are firmly in control in most religious orders, and God help the heterosexual man who wants to become a priest. As things are are currently unfolding the priesthood will be a gay profession. I am not talking about homosexuals living a chaste life. I'm talking about an openly gay priesthood.If you want the truth on this matter I very strongly recommed, GOODBYE! GOOD MEN."
4,The best book for a gerbil owner!,"This book so far I think si one of the best gerbil books I have read so far. The book is filled with detailed color photos and descriptions. The book also contains valuable gerbil care, housing, and other information which can be useful to ownersin times of need. This book is definately a must for every gernil owners out there. :)"
4,DK's - DMPO's on Broadway,This is pretty much a must have for DK fans. Pretty good visual and sound quality for 1984. Not the best playlist but a really good concert. It gives a really good perspective of the Dead Kennedy's in concert during their prime.
4,The best of the unknown bands,"I first encountered The Call on MTV that first season when the music video was taking off. The song was ""The Walls Came Down"" and I was hooked.The Call have been referred to as the American U2, not without cause. The band evolved and each step, each new release was a gem. They are one of those bands that leave you scratching your head wondering why they never enjoyed the success they deserved.I can't recommend this record and all their others highy enough."
1,Not Happy!,"This Adapter was bought for my daughter's computer, because the first one broke. This one lasted about a month and malfunctioned, causing damage to my daughters computer. After repairs and replacement of adapter we wish we had researched this product better. It was a costly lesson."
5,WHO'S WHO IN THE BIBLE,"Terrific for quick reference, and very helpful to help anyone who is teaching Bible lessons,etc. I think everyone would find this book a must have. Our young people find the Bible confusing, this will help them also, so many times through out the Bible, names are repeated, or sounds the same. This book really, really goes hand in hand with reading the Bible. Great for all ages, we can never learn enough, no matter how many times we read the Bible, but this book helps explain who we are reading about. I'd rate it 10+. Hope this helps.Jeanette Storaska"
5,GREAT SHOW,"Kansas - Device, Voice, DrumBand is a bit older but so am I. Sound and song selection is Great. I saw Kansas six times in the 70's I liked the grainey effect on the video Thats the way they looked live. In the 70's a show like Kansas was always smokey----a Great contact high--- seacond hand as it was."
5,Get this DVD,"If you are a fan of classic rock, this dvd is a must have for your collection. I've seen Kansas close to a dozen times with the most recent show at Station Casino in St Charles Missouri, like wine, they get better with age....."
2,Hypocrites = Kansas,"If this is the same video that was shown on Direct TV a number of months ago, the band had a black Church choir backing them up on a few tunes. Kerry Livgren, Dave Hope, Warren Ham and John Elefante (all professing Christians in the band) were all lambasted by the other band members for being unashamedly and unapologetic about their faith in the 80's, especially Livgren. Read Livgren's book ""Seeds of Change"" about this fact. SHAME! I thought Christians were supposed to be the hypocrites. Hmm?"
5,Device...Voice...Awsome...WOW,"This is it. I honestly thought that Steve Walsh was done a few years ago. I have always been a Kansas fan and It sounded like Walsh's voice had been getting rougher with each new album. I have been proven wrong. Steve Walsh and the the rest of the guys have got still got it in a big way. These guys are some of the best talent in music. The production quality is beyond expectation. I love to watch this DVD. If you do not have it, get it. Steve pulls miracles out of no where with his voice. Kansas rock."
3,cool book,"I'm Italian, yeah. I liked this book very much- but hey, just one thing. The book says Giovanna's English is not very good. Maybe so, but you see, most of teens in Italy can't really speak English. Please be more understanding...at least Giovanna tried to speak another language!"
4,Ciao!,"This is good.A really dumb girl from Italy comes to stay at the Wakefields,and is pretty rude to everyone."
1,There's not much I can say...,"This movie is quite possibly the worst one I've seen all year. Please, pass it by. I'm begging you. This movie ought not to have been made. If the computer would let me give it negative stars, I would."
1,AWFUL!!!,"Having watched the series The Mod Squad, i was very excited they was making a movie. The movie sucked big time. Nothing like the series, very boring and confusing. It could have been a whole lot better movie."
1,Watch the TV Show Instead,"Hip young punks you can't help but hate, cardboard bad cops that get foiled by punks, and you know the whole story. A mind-numbing and tedious grind. The only reason it gets one star is for curing my insomnia."
4,Great stainless pan,Our family was concerned that as the non-stick coatings wore off our pans we were eating it. So we decided to go with full stainless pans instead. We've had two of these pans for a year or so and have been very happy with them. The only thing I don't like about them is that the heat doesn't extend up the sides of the pans. For instance if you make scrambled eggs the eggs will cook nicely on the bottom but their will still be a thin layer of raw egg left on the sides. It's due to this issue that I rated it as 4 stars rathter than 5.
2,self-satisfied screed,"For those who do not share Mr. Lewis' smug Christianity these letters are likely to quickly lose their charm. Mr. Lewis' religiousness is of a very narrow, cloistered, sort. It arrogantly dismisses practically all worldly conditions and concerns that we may look to religion to address. Neither does it have the depth or feeling one associates with mysticism. It is a religion of the self-satisfied and elect.The conceit of having letters from Screwtape to a favored demon nephew palls at about letter V, there are XXXI. What wittiness there is fades as Lewis settles into his screed.In fact it occurred to me that the work is a satire on the self-satisfied perspective it appears to represent. If so Mr. Lewis has brilliantly fooled a lot of people."
3,careful,"If you don't speak Thai then this is not the product for you. It wasn't clear in the description, but the translator only works if you know how to read thai characters. When it translates from english to thai it writes it in thai characters. It looks like a great translator though for somebody who wants to learn english and knows thai."
4,Comfortable and Familiar -- great value!,"I'll be frank. I bought this set because of the price. How can you beat under $4 for a whole oratorio? I was apprehensive because of some of the very negative reviews, however I was pleasantly surprised. Ok, it may not be the pinnacle of recording quality, and probably isn't the most historically accurate interpretation. However, as an ""old school"" musician (very old), I didn't find it offensive in the least. If you are very particular about your recording quality and historical authenticity, this is not the recording for you. This is a comfortable, familiar rendition for people like me who just want to hear ""Handel's Messiah"" the way you remember singing it in college chorus (ok, a very very good college chorus with paid soloists!)."
4,Handel's Messiah Download,It was very good mood music for Christmas morning before the house wakes up :-)I look forward to listening to it through out the year.
2,Poor recording technique,"I own wonderful recordings of Messiah. I thought it would be nice to have a more recent recording. I guess I misinterpreted the release date on this version. It is possible that this is the best performance ever created. Unfortunately, the recording technique is terrible and quite frankly, I could not listen to the entire recording.I should have known from the price that something was wrong. I will stick to recordings by Shaw and Marriner.Marc Silverstein, M.D."
2,"Helpful, but best to read ""Miserly Moms""","Being an at home mom of two, I was in love with Jonni's 1st book ""Miserly Moms"". I was excited to read ""Frugal Families"" but instead was dissapointed to find that it contained much of the same information.........not my best ""frugal"" purchase!The content, although, would be valuable to someone that has never read her first book.....but I would suggest that they try MM instead...."
2,CD skips,"CD skips about three quarters of the way through. Given as gift, so the results didn't become apparent until after the holidays. While shipping was good, product was defective."
4,Music from a Farther Room,"I heard Lucia Micarelli during a 2007 Josh Groban concert. Her live solo performance in addition to her backgrounds for Groban were mesmerizing. I purchased this album to see if it was as enjoyable as her live work, and I was not disappointed. Micarelli performs a good mix of classical and pop pieces. My favorite tracks on the album are Smarkland, Meditation, Lady Grinning Soul, Portrait, and Nocturne/Bohemian Rhapsody."
4,A beautiful strory; beautiful people; beautiful land.,"Having lived in China for seven of the past 10 years and having traveled to Mongolia many times over those years, I was surprised to find a movie which reflected the ""souls"" of the three nationalities I've known here: the Chinese, the Russians, and the Mongolians. In ""Close to Eden"" the cultures don't clash with each other; rather, they meet and reflect each other's strengths, pains, and (in the end) humanity. It is a story of a Mongolian family as seen through the eyes of the Russian truck driver in a remote area of northern China. Each culture is holding on to its own while it must intereact with the others. The actors are not ""slick"" or polished; in fact, most of them are not even professional actors; they are Chinese, Mongolian, and Russian people being themselves. And the movie is better for it."
4,Coolest Christmas album ever,"For a change of pace from your normal holiday music, buy this album. It's perfect for a party where you want festive, upbeat Yule tunes. Both my brothers were skeptical when I put this on, but when it was over they said, ""Play it again!"" in unison."
2,not too bad,"Got the slushie maker from home shopping club. Actually it does work, but you have to not pay any attention to the instructions, they don't make any sense. you just put ice half way up in the container, use the salt cup provided with the machine, pour salt on it (you can use regular salt) then more ice cubes to 3/4's of the way up, more salt on that. Turn the machine on and gradually pour in the liquid from the top dispenser. It does work. However it does not do diet sodas or fruit juices, only liquids with high sugar content. If you are on a diet, don't use this machine. otherwise it does work. Some writers say that the machine can walk across the counter top it will if you put too much ice in it, it causes the canister to get cold too quickly, and causes the paddles to stick on the ice on the canister. Too much ice is no good. I think that it is over priced, but the machine is not all that bad. I only give it two stars because the instruction book is bunk."
4,For Those Concerned About Air Pollution,"As an expat currently in China, I'm concerned about air pollution. I found the results of this semi-scientific test compelling:[...]Bottom line, this model was able to filter out 94% of PM0.3 particles. The less expensive Paralda model was able to filter 80%. I'd make a decision balancing price and effectiveness for your own needs."
5,thunderstorms,"excellent svce.easiest way to get our unusual cds. would use this site again.. made for easy listening, thoroughly enjoyed this cd."
2,unrealistic,"The thunder... well, there isn't enough of it, and what there is, often sounds rather artificial to me.The thunder is often sudden, but it will hit you after LONG periods of no thunder at all. It would have been nice to have the thunder more regularly spaced throughout... just like a real thunderstorm."
2,disappointing,"I have purchased other sounds of nature cds becasue I really like listening to the rain at night when I'm going to slepp. I was really disappointed with this cd. The rain sounds are really low and like it is dribbling from a pipe rather than a rain storm and the thunder is exceptionally loud, too loud in comparison so its jolts you awake. If you like loud thunder then you will like this but I wouldn't recommend for a relaxing listen at night."
5,a burning message from a burning heart!,"I have read many christian books in the past, but this stands out. Bro Leonard did not beat about the bush. The chapters are short enough to be read in about fifteen minutes, but they are so packed that each may take you two solid hours to read. Every chapter is thought-provoking. Since I got the book in 1984, I have read it more than 30 times! And each time, it appears as if I never read it before. If you would read this book, be ready to end up upon your knees!"
5,great read for any preacher are anyone needing fired up,Great read really made a deffrence in my prayer life and my desire to serve god. It shows where the church is failing. It is not sugar coated.
2,Very little substance,"This book was not well written and was basically the author praising Peyton in a cringe-worthy fashion. There wasn't any substantive and the book ends with Peyton getting drafted by the Colts. If you're interested in learning about Peyton, get the book he and his father helped write (there's more stuff about his childhood, family relationships, etc.)."
5,"Shows the man behind the football mask, great.","I have always been a huge fan of Peyton Manning and wanted to read about him in a mid sized novel. I found exactly what I was looking for in this book, it told me everything I wanted to know from his upbringing and childhood, to his college football career, to NFL analysis of his ability to make it big in the NFL. For any one who wants to learn about the best quarterback in University of Tennessee history I suggest you read this book"
2,Would have been great.,"I was so excited to have Santa bring this home to our three year old. He is such a big superman fan. By the end of the first night we were having to re-inflate again. By morning the poor thing was on the ground. We kept up the process for about a week and then it just got to be too much work. Too bad, this would have been great."
3,A Visual Learner Needed Help!,"When I heard Christopher talk about his ""Seven Layers of Design"" I couldn't wait to try it out. He was speaking to me! His book was extremely helpful, but being a visual learner, I thought the video would help all the more. I hate to say I was disappointed, but I was. It was redundant. I would have liked more examples with different rooms. The one room he uses is great, but the tape shows the same clips twice! Once about decorating and again about the psychology of seven layers. I found myself fast forwarding instead of listening. It will be a good reference tape, but I will probably use the book more."
5,A must buy for all golf fanatics and teaching professionals!,"As a teaching professional for the David Leadbetter Golf Academy, I was anxiously awaiting the arrival of David's new book. David is an inovator and very creative, and he is always in search of new ideas that will enhance his philosophy of teaching. After obtaining photos of Hogan, which were the actual photos from Hogan's great instruction book, David carefully describes in detail Hogan's mechanics and breaks them down into ways no one else can. David is a true genius, and this is why he is and will remain on top of the instructional world. Just to point out a few areas, you will find very interesting details on Hogan's ""transition"" and his ""release"" which were very informative. This book will help you understand why Hogan was known as the best ball striker of all time."
4,Jefferson Starship Earth,"I really like ""Love too Good""...probably best song Jefferson Starship did. I also like ""Count On Me"" and ""Runaway"", particularly the lyrics to ""Count On Me""."
1,This is not the key to sensual softcore,"Do not be fooled into buying this movie. If you are looking for a sensual, clever softcore film with lingerie, stockings and the like, than look elsewhere. Any sex that is shows is not steamy or provocative. There are far less expensive alternatives if you are looking for something good in the softcore genre that can be shared with a signficant other."
3,A little of the norm,not a bad film but as per most of these films the sex scenesare thrust in where ever possible being appropriate or not. The onescene with the two ladies most appealing. Not a bad flick
1,Garbage,"This headset will last for a few months if you baby it. They're cheap so buy a half dozen, so you can throw them out as they stop working."
3,It had potential.,I enjoyed the story line but felt it really didn't go into the depth of the characters. I also felt that the romance was just thrown in. So much more could have been done with the movie.
2,"lacks, big time","I was very, very, very, very dissapointed with this movie. There was a lot of things in his movie that were good (Johnny Depp being one of them, though silent he still pulls it off in the end). This is the second movie they have been in (Sleepy Hollow being the other one) CAte Blanchett is annoying in her russian accent and John Tuturro is so ever nagging (Tuturro and Depp team up 3 years later in Secret Window). lots of singing and Blanchett seduces Tuturro alot. Depp and his care for his family and his silent love for Ricci are the main points I really thought were good but it did end well and thank god Blanchett got blown away towards the end. a let down, really"
2,Skip It,"Johnny Depp is brooding, but not even he could save this snoozer. Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz..."
1,SADLY ONE OF THE WORST FILMS MADE!!!!!!!,"GREAT CAST / HORRIBLE SCRIPT / LAUGHABLE PERFORMACES / A WASTE OF TIME , MONEY & FILM / THEY PUT SOO MUCH MAKEUP ON THE VERY BEAUTIFUL CATE BLANCHETT THAT SHE LOOKS LIKE CARNIVAL CLOWN & THAT IS SAD / DEPP LOOKS LIKE HE WANTS TO KILL SOMEBODY / RICCI PLAYS A RUSSIAN LITTLE ORPHAN ANNIE VIRGIN AND TURTURRO LIP SINGS OPERA AS A HORSE RELIEVES HIMSELF ON THE STAGE / SOUNDS LIKE A COMEDY BUT IT IS NOT / STAY CLEAR OF THIS DISASTER PLEASE."
2,Dull,"I looked forward to this film, but all together it is very not engaging at all. I love foreign films,and I'm used to slow pace.But this one just went no where fast. The acting is good. Ricci is great, as is Depp as a quiet Gypsy. Blanchett is good, and Tuttorro even arouses a little sympathy, as an Italian nationalist. But all together this film is uneffecting. I didn't care about the charachters either way. It's only saving grace is the touching ending, if you can make it that far."
4,SUPER FILM! Be careful whether or not you want subtitles!,"An extremely well done remake of the Burt Lancaster film ""7 DAYS IN MAY"", which deals with a military coup here in the United States. Both movies are good.In this remake, Forrest Whitaker plays a level-headed US Marine Major (our Hero!!). The ever-stately Sam Waterston plays the President with eloquent grace. Another excellent performance is given by the late Jason Robards, who plays (ironically) the power-hungry facist General leading the coup.'MY' only mistake was I should have been more careful when I placed the order. The VHS I received had spanish subtitles throughout the entire movie. A truly beautiful language - Spanish - but regarding the subtitles in this film - I found them an annoying distraction.Other than that - a very good film - which should be appreciated by any military enthusiast and/or black-helicopter wierdo. (I being a little of both)."
4,Morphing?,"So, having got into Morphine (the band, not the drug) via my very cool roomie, I picked this up as a related item. Not quite as cool as M., but also not bad. Try the samples, you might like 'em!(I've never gone back and listened to this again, so I'm taking it down to 3 stars)."
3,"A good novel, not a good historical reference of Salem W","First of all, Starkey is not a historian she is a journalist who were interested writing about the witchcraft. The book was more like a novel (with lots of drama) than arguments or explain why did the Salem Witchcraft evoked during the year of 1692. She focused on the trials and what the characters did, but she did not explain or argued why certain characters, such as Ann Putnam, did what she did during the outbreak of witchcraft. If you are interested reading about the Salem witchcraft, instead of trying to understand what really happened, this would be a good book for you. Besides that, I don't recommened anyone reading it unless you like drama, because at the end of her book she complicated the story with her opinions and random facts."
4,eyes of a stranger,"Eyes of a StrangerI saw this movie in the 80's have been searching for it to watchover again. Found it on Amazon, very suspensful movie and of courseLauren Tewes is a terrific actress. So glad I found it again nowI can watch whenever I want. Thank you Amazon"
5,Underrated suspense thriller,"Recipient of some of the decade's worst reviews, this film deserves a better fate. It has moments of sheer, unadulterated terror that makes the shower scene in Psycho look like Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood in terms of visceral impact. I'm not putting down the Master, but ""Eyes of a Stranger"" works as a tribute to him. I think he really would have enjoyed this film. It does what Hitchcock liked to do best, manipulate the audience."
5,No snipe if set up right,"It's wortrh the time to make sure the infeed and outfeed tables are set up or else you'll get snipe-although, I found, it was still minimal. Excellent machine!"
1,"Bought two, gave two away, free and working.","I'am a general contractor in Hawaii, these planers work great the first 10 hours, then broken sprockets and poor stock feed made me give the two I bought away no charge."
4,Solid planer for the money,"I have to say I'm very pleased with the purchase of this planer. Others have complained about issues such as the depth of cut indicator being off, the depth stops not being accurate, etc. I have to say that these are almost to be expected on a machine this size. The remedy is to get an inexpensive pair of calipers and measure the wood each time it runs through.These minor inconveniences aside, the planer really does perform as expected. It leaves a beautiful finish that needs minimal sanding to get the wood stainable. On cold days, you might have to help the wood through the machine, but worse things have happened.Overall, I'm very pleased. For the money I spent, I feel that I got an outstanding value."
1,Come on please.........,I hear so much fuzz comparing their music to the Beatles. Do yourself a favor and dont ever repeat this. Im sorry to say this group doesnt even get near to PFR in quality of music. This cd is awful!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2,BURNED AGAIN,"Too bad about all that soprano sax playing. I found out the hard way a couple of years ago. If this instumentation does not appeal to you try - James Moody AND THE BRASS FIGURES. 8 tenor sax tunes 1 flute number, most with light ensemble backing, recorded a couple of years earlier."
2,Not Worth The Effort,"There is so much that is logically wrong with this movie, that it defies description. To go into all of them would be tantamount to a list of spoilers for anyone who wants to see the movie. Let's just ask: how long do you think it would take one man (and an old man with a limp, at that) to move two tons of diamonds? And then there's Demi Moore, who's supposed to be American but for some reason is speaking with a terrible British accent. Yes, she was educated at Oxford and has lived in England for 15 years, but take it from someone who has lived abraod for quite some time: unless you're a young child (young children easily adapt to new accents and learning new languages) you don't start speaking with an accent unless you are deliberately trying to sound affected. If you want to see a good heist movie, see the granddaddy of them all - Rififi, but don't waste your time with this one."
1,Not Good.....Don't Buy,"I am a professional interior designer, ASID member.I upgraded to Punch Professional thinking it had to be better than the other Punch software I had. WRONG. It is impossible to draw interiors walls with exact measures as it always deducts the wall thickness. The "" Ruler"" in useless as it is huge and cumbersome and hard to keep in a straight line. The furniture templates are a joke.You have no idea what they look like( and they certainly aren't pretty)or their size until you drag them into place.Stick to a pencil & graph paper.Can't anyone create a software program for the Design Professional that is not cartoonish.Something quicker & easier than AutoCad. I know people would spend the money for it.Any ideas???"
5,Finally a package worth buying,"I like many have run though the halls of Amazon reading reviews on software. First I bought Siera Home Arch and that software was neat but it was very slow, required too much memory and had countless quirks (I am being kind) that wasted so much of my time trying to work around. But alas, it did not have what I needed which was split level designs. So I went back to the market and got Punch Professional and let me tell you, it is great. It works differently than Siera, but it does 1000 times more stuff with almost no quirks. I can really design anything in it with the quality of a professional. I think these is the best I have seen and would highly recommend it."
4,Extremely comprehensive!,"An excellent compendium of cinematic knowledge, from Edison and Lumiere up to Robocop and Tron. I happen to also be taking a film history class with Dr. Cook and I can say that although his teaching style is a bit dry, he certainly knows his stuff. The book is well organized in terms of chronology and geography, tracing artistic movements and schools of thought from the prehistory through 1895 and beyond. The only thing that kept it from 5 stars would be its sometimes overwhelming amount of information (particularly lists of foreign film titles, not all of which are translated) - as a student, I would prefer that the text focused on the films that had a discerable impact on the development of the genre rather than just being listed for their own sake. Definitely recommended!"
3,BAMF,"Ridley gives you the unexpected. Not a bad thing in today's cookie-cutter world. Not always satisfying, but you have to read. He's on the edge of a big one, I want to see it when it comes."
3,Just a minor note.,"Amazon, or whoever produced the art for this edition, is displaying the wrong portrait on the cover. The portrait above is of the 19th century's Samuel Butler, the author of ""Erewhon"" and a translator of Homer's work. The author of this work was the Samuel Butler of the 17th century, a favorite of Charles II and a popular poet and satirist. Quite a shoddy, lazy mistake... The poor effort here has disinclined me from purchasing this electronic version."
1,Waterpick Shower Head,"We had an older version of this shower head that was excellent.This one is pathetic. It does not stay up, it squeeks when you move it. Twice the flexible stalk just fell off of the mount.Wish I never bought it.I put the old one back up."
3,works well,"No problem with the product as advertised, but wish it had a pulse massage setting!It does well what it claims to do."
1,High failure rate,This is the 3rd one of these we have had. My wife likes them because she can shower without getting her hair wet. The first two failed when water would come out the sides of the head and not through it.The third one (just a month old) suddenly would not flow any water through it and the flex tube would not stay in the desired position.these two problems may be related.We had to throw it away.
2,Two of them failed in less than 6 months,"Two of them failed in less than 6 months. The first one had an air bubble in plastic base, which broke off. Both the first one and the replacement suffered from low flow after a while. There is an oversized wall lining inside the ""goose neck"", which tends to warp after flexing multiple times and almost totally obstructs the flow. I'm flexing the ""goose neck"" every day, so I can rinse shower stall walls.Rubber ring gasket is undersized and gets shredded into multiple pieces when screwed onto shower pipe, with the largest one ending up inside the pipe.The good part is their customer service, which quickly replaced broken shower head after I filled a short online form."
2,"Weak,cheap, doesnt live up to expectations","No chrome, just plastic, more cheaply made than past versions. This product has a weak anemic stream and does not live up to the waterpik reputation. I removed and put my old one back."
1,junk,"This piece of junk is nothing like the one I bought 10 years ago. It's leaky, has no pressure (even with the restricter removed), the setting adjuster is a pain in the A**, the massager setting is a joke.....etc, etc, etc...and I bought 2 of these things for dual shower, so it's not a fluke lemon, only thing it does have is it looks better than the 10 year old one."
2,Showers great but gets black mold in 4 mos,"Back in Jan 1, 2011, I rated this 5 *s but have knocked off 3 *s because of mold issue. So this is a buyer beware. Gives great showers as long as you remove the stupid water restrictor inside the tube. BUT, and I mean BUT...keep an eye for mold!Here it is May 27, 2011 and this showerhead has developed black drippy MOLD around the center nozzles, also some of the outer green rubber nozzles! I've owned Waterpiks since the early 80's and this is THE 1st to ever get mold...nasty. Took it off and soaked the head and tube with bleach. It now appears every 3 months I will need to soak the head and tube in bleach to prevent/retard mold growth. If it starts to gather mold sooner I'll chunk it in the recycle bin and buy something else, but not another Waterpik."
3,The older version was better,"I have bought these showerheads so I can stand up straight in the shower and not have to crouch down. I bought one 10 years ago and it performed wonderfully. Well, the latest version is ""high quality"" made in China and it doesn't stay up as high as it should, so I have rubber bands holding it up as high as it will go. Way to go Waterpik..."
2,"Leaks, not like the old model",We were excited to find this. The older model that's all white was in our shower at our old apt and we loved it. This new version leaks. Had to send it back
5,Wonderful Showerhead,"This is the 2nd buy of this same product only because it was left behind at my former residence. I am short and do not shampoo my hair every day but love to take a shower. The Waterpik Flex hose allows me to do that wonderfully and if there are taller folks wanting to use the shower after me.....a slight bend of the hose is all that is necessary. My only complaint is that they are not available in the stores any more and they used to come in white, now only a chrome and grey version are available. Other than that.....I love it."
4,Great when it works!,"The first one broke before we got it installed, but return was easy and the second one worked perfectly."
4,MP3 Titles Mixed Up,"Amazon, the mp3 titles are mixed up. I downloaded ""Lacinhos Cor De Rosa (Pink Shoe Laces)"" and it downloaded a different song I don't recognize. I then downloaded ""Tunel Do Amor (Have Lips, Will Kiss In The Tunnel Of Love"" and it's actually Pink Shoe Laces. I haven't downloaded any of the rest, so don't know how many titles are mixed up."
3,POOR PRICE TO PAY FOR SUCH A GENIUS,"The price one must pay for being famous -- and a father -- is that one of your kids will write a book about you. There will be the good. And the bad. Victoria Price doesn't do a ""Daddy Dearest,"" nor does she dish too much in this bio of her father, he who continues to scare the bejesus out of filmgoers in such classics as ""The Fly,"" ""House on Haunted Hill"" and ""House of Wax."" She does reveal some shockers: As a student, Price was anti-Semitic, writing letters praising Hitler; during the McCarthy witchhunt of the '50s, he condemned his peers who took the Fifth when asked if they were members of the Communist Party. Price's effete quality is also discussed, and though Victoria claims she could not find any evidence Dad was gay or bisexual, he did acknowledge that he once had a relationship with a man that he described as ""a love affair without the sex."" A small price to pay, indeed."
1,Proof Greatness Skips A Generation,"Such a charming, elegant, and intelligent man deserved much better. Victoria's liberal bias taints an otherwise sentimental recollection of life with one of the most gracious men that ever lived. Instead read Vincent Price's own writings, which are much more revealing and still widely available."
3,Worth buying at a budget,"As a long time admirer of Vincent Price I found this book quite interesting and entertaining. On the plus side ,it provides a comprehensive overview of the subject's movie career with enough ""Behind the Scenes"" trivia to satisfy the fans. It certainly opens the door on the various Price households (plural !) and there are a few revelations. The author has a smooth writing style and the book is easy to read.However,far too much space was devoted to ""Vinnie's"" involvement in the world of art . I found myself skipping over ALOT of pages . Worth buying at a budget ""Price"" if you're a fan of this uniquely talented actor."
5,The Greatest CD ever recorded !,"This is without a doubt my all-time favorite CD. This captures the Hip at their best, 'Blow at High Dough' and 'New Orleans is Sinking' alone make it worthy of anyone's collection."
5,A must have for every Canadian!,"This is one of those albums that must be in your collection, we all know all the words to every song, and it's a part of who we are..great album!"
3,"Concise and accessible, but nothing special.","Overall the book is decent, but it doesn't go beyond a describing a collection of exercise moves. The exercises in this book are conveniently grouped by body region. The pictures and descriptions of each exercise are good and helpful. There is little to tie it all together, or to help design a personalized routine. There is nothing in it that can not be found for free on the web."
4,dumbell training,"No new exercises but pretty good learning manual, especially if you are just starting to work with dumbbells. The information is the same as the posters you can buy here though."
2,"Looking for the perfect remix of ""Vertigo""? this ain't it....","When the Jack Lee Knife mix of this song was charting Billboard's dance chart, I was so excited to obtain it, because a mix of New Order's ""Waiting for the Siren's Call"" brilliantly captured New Order's classic sound while bringing it up to modern electro house standards. Can't say the same for this mix of U2's best song in years. What you need to do is get the CD single for ""Sometimes You Can't Make it On your Own,"" which has the Redanka remix of ""vertigo"" as a b-side, a powerhouse 7 minute anthem mix of the song."
3,Good movie to watch with my 3 year old,"My son is 3 and watching this with him is the only reason I would see this. The only other possible reason is being a Broncos fan and seeing all that classic Broncos merchandise with their best emblem. Brought back some good memories of old Mile High Stadium. You really appreciate Denver's old uniforms with this movie. After all, the Broncos have had the worst uniforms in any sport since 1997. It's a decent family movie. Most of all for kids. After all, that's their target audience, kids from 3-12 years of age."
4,A Very Cute Movie For People Who Love Dog Movies!,I don't have the DVD for the movie Bingo and I have never watched the movie on DVD but only on video tape and I thought this was a cute movie. I know that the professional critics didn't like this movie and a lot of people put it down because they think it's too cutesy but when I watched the movie Bingo I enjoyed it it and I liked the cast especially Cindy Williams from the TV show Laverne and Shirley and David Rasche from the TV show Sledge Hammer and I recommend this movie to anyone who likes movies about dogs. In my opinion this movie is cute but it's not too cutesy! It is about a cute dog named Bingo who runs away from his cruel original owner and is found by a little boy who hides him in his house because his father who is a professional football player is allergic to dogs. [...] I would hate to buy the DVD if it's a pan and scan edit of a widescreen movie!
1,Violent,"Violent, coarse, and unredeeming. Not for children of any age. If you want your children to learn to pronounce F**K, S**T,P**S, C**P and other expletives,--this is the movie for you!"
2,Chabannes good but difficult to show to younger crowd,I purchased this video after seeing it recommended by the random acts of kindness website. I planned to show it to 8th grade students. The length of the video and its incredible detail made it impossible to show to students of this age who aren't history buffs already. I was able to use a few of the chapters as backup to a description of what was happening at that time. I would not recommend this for anyone below a 10th grade level.
1,Poor battery replacement,"The battery does not live up to any expectations, the lights do not come on when you press on the battery tester and the charge is not as long as expected. Would never buy from this company again unless they change their products."
4,Powerbook G4 replacement battery not bad.,Fits great like the original and looks identical but battery life is probably 90% of the original. Can't beat it for the price though. I recommend it.
4,battery works but overheats too easily,"The seller is professional -- shipping is quick and I receive the product in good condition. As for the battery, it sort of works fine. After the 2nd recharge, the batter easily overheats to the point that the recharge stops automatically and the battery has to be cooled down before the recharge can be resumed. I did not have such a problem with the authentic powerbook battery, but this could be that my laptop is old and the fan happens to stop working at the same time? My current solution is to use something to lift up the bottom a bit to help circulation (I suppose a notebook rest and stand will work better). I am still yet to see how long this battery will last."
2,not so hotsie,"This screenplay shows the authors have writing talent, but that it is not very developed yet. William Goldman helped write this screenplay, and even HE didn't think it was that great a screenplay (as he says in ""Premiere"" magazine). I know it won Oscars for the writers, but then Sylvester Stallone was once nominated for a best-acting Oscar...what does that tell you about the award? I think this screenplay showed promise, and I hope the writers try to develop their skill further, so that one day they may write a good screenplay. But winning an Oscar, they may think they don't need to improve, and that would be bad for them and movie audiences, both."
2,Where's the Beef?,"Why, you ask, would anyone rate this screenplay a mere 3? I mean, there's that searing NSA monologue...that alone is worth a 10!But wait! In spite of a lengthy quotation from that monolog in Amazon.com's review (soon to be removed, I hope), NONE of that monolog is included in the book being sold here!Certainly I expect there to be differences between a screenplay and what appears on the screen; however, film-only material should not be included in a review of a published screenplay without clearly stating that the material appears only in the film version."
1,So sad to find this book so dire,"I have read many of this author's books and enjoyed most of them; indeed some are, in my view, in the 5 star/keeper category. Not this one. I admit I gave up after page 75. The stilted, silly dialogue, the ridiculous over-done cardboard characters and the wholly unbelievable plot was too much and, frankly, I was not prepared to waste my time plodding through something that had already bored me to tears. The author seemed to have found a plot she could not properly bring in line and then populated it with characters who could not catch my attention. It was, sadly, for me a huge, huge disappointment. Hopefully this is a one-off aberration!"
4,An easy read,"Good story and great chemistry, no back stories which I was grateful for. It made for an enjoyable read that I didn't have to keep rereading to understand paragraphs and chapters. I really liked Vane. My favorite character so far, he was easy to get to know and not cocky with his powers, hope we see more of him in books to come. Was gratefully to have to read of Artie the birch godless too :)"
4,Liked it,This was a welcome relief after reading the last book. I liked the continuation of the story of the wolves. I especially liked how the ending wasn't wrapped in an over sized bow. We hope it turns out okay. I found myself routing for the characters and how the heroine spent time thinking her love for the hero through. I also like the fish out of water aspect of Vane trying to be human.
3,Nat as intense as I thought,This story was a bit different than the previous books whereas I felt there wasn't as much intensity. The romance was a bit awkward between the characters. I felt it was a story to know the life better of a Were Hunter vs. a Dark Hunter but that was about it for me.
5,Awesome Christmas Story,I love this kind of heart warming story that takes us to the city that never sleeps! New York! Its about a family learning to heal and a son trying to find his way - if you like Hallmarkers you'll love this movie.
3,Works...for a while that is...,"After applying one application of the Genie Glu3 tube the garage was very quiet again. This lasted about 3 weeks before it got noisy. This seems to be the case for old screw drive garages. If your garage is relatively new, one application will last for a longer time."
1,Absolute Nonsense - run away now,"I am speechless. I usually consider myself to have an open mind but this pushes the limit of incredulity even for me. To publish electronic circuit diagrams and in the first operating instruction is (and I paraphrase) ""perform the salt cleansing and ask Jesus Christ to bless the apparatus and allow you to travel through time"", which is more important? That you get the electronics right, or the prayer?Leave your money in your bank account"
4,Streets of Laredo,"It was a great flick. Mint condition and speedy shipping. Recommend the seller, for sure."
3,Critics corner,"This movie was excellent, but it was NOT as good as the origional story, Lonesome Dove. I thought the actors were top notch although it would have been nice to see the origional actors. The story is suspenseful, and kept me guessing. I recommend this movie if you are a Lonesome Dove fan, like myself."
1,Not a great sequal to Lonesome Dove,Very disappointing. Lonesome Dove is one of the greatest movies of all times. I had hopes the follow up would be close to the same but it lacked in every way. The cast is not nearly as good and the movie is just tiring all the way through. It drags and does not live up to Lonesome Dove.
4,Share the Memories!,"For parents and non-parents alike, Memories, Lessons & Advice: A Guide to Parenting Issues is a thoroughly enjoyable read.Author Ron Snyder celebrates fatherhood buy offering an honest, down-to-earth account of his own child rearing experience as well as memories from his childhood. Although it is called a ""guide,"" it is presented as a narrative with each chapter tackling a real life parenting challenge.Snyder's anecdotes are told with a wisdom and level headedness most often found at the knee of a grandparent. Written with honesty, sensitivity, and warmth, Memories, Lessons & Advice is both touching and informative."
3,Not a bad book - Good fundamentals less on development focus,This book is all about Web services platform architecture and standards. It cooks well on most of the alphabet soup of web services standards. This book would guide you instead of browsing over the internet for what is what. The book falls short on guidelines for implementing them. The book also a bit old in its evolving specifications and endorsed standards coverage particularly less about WS-I and WS-Security* standards. That is disappointing.
3,Contrived,"I secured this book because I had heard great things about it. What a disappointment! She is no more ""cured"" than anyone else who has undergone intensive therapy and/or dialectical behavior therapy -- but she paid many, many more thousands of dollars for her intensive psychotherapy. I guess she wrote the book to pay off her doctor's bills.... Don't be deceived: her way is not *the solution*."
3,Fairbanks Sequel Deserves a Full Restoration,"With its impressive action highlights weighed down by an exposition-heavy script, the uneven ""Don Q, Son of Zorro"" (1925) does not represent Douglas Fairbanks at his absolute best. However, it deserves the same restoration that graced ""The Black Pirate"" and ""The Iron Mask."" This Delta Entertainment DVD utilizes the same scratchy 16mm print as the Kino release, but features a superior score comprised of stock orchestral music. Since an original 35mm print of ""Don Q"" exists, let's put it out there!"
1,Cute story about daughter-father relationship,"This is a really cute story about the relationship between a father (Peter Falk) who is a mobster just released from prison who meets his daughter for the first time. It's a comedy with some foreseeable events but it's the performances that are fun to watch. Falk is terrific. Weist is lovingly hilarious as the ""oversexed"" mistress and mother of the daughter. Brenda Vacarro is wonderfully funny in a campy role as the wife. But Adrian Pasdar as the daughter's love interest and ""young sidekick, mobster wannabe"" is usually the perfect foil for the rest of the other outrageous, campy roles. Pasdar charmingly steals the scenes. Even though he is often the ""straight man"" in this comedy, he manages to play the comedic parts very well and is as funny as the more seasoned actors. Though dated (the daughter is a ""Madonna wannabe"") it is a truly fun ride."
4,Decent Quality for the price,"I did a full bath remodel four months ago and bought this to go with the brushed nickel faucets. I couldn't find any handheld shower heads that I liked better, or at a price I was willing to pay, so I ordered this one.Installation was simple and I removed the flow restrictor as others have done. The finish is decent and goes well with the faucets.It works well and I expect to use it for a long time."
3,"Easy to install, but not as powerful as I expected...","Good price. I didn't like that its made of metal looking plastic, wish it was made of a sturdy metal, but I guess you get what you pay for. Easy to install, and nice long cord, however it's stream is very weak. My shower has incredible water pressure, so I know its not my shower, my old shower head was like a fire hose power blaster, so I was looking for something a little more gentle as to not blast my face off, but this is pretty weak, even the stronger settings don't get all the soap out of my hair as quickly as I'd like. If you prefer a more gentle pressure, then this shower head may work out for you, but if your looking for something more powerful, I'd shop around a bit more and maybe spend the extra dollar."
5,Great Product!,"This product is just as advertised! I've had it for a month and it works great! Water pressure is the best I've seen in a while, it was easy to install, an no issues thus far. Thanks to the other reviewers for helping me with my decision too!"
1,"Mysterious brown liquid, Horrible smell.","I noticed a few mysterious brown spots on the shower head while still in the packaging.Undaunted, and perhaps foolishly, I removed the shower head from the packaging, and was hit with an odor so strong as to be nearly nausea inducing. I can only describe it as reminiscent of some sort of industrial or chemical plant. I shudder to think of what factory this thing came from.Thirty minutes and a mild headache later, I'm heading out to buy a replacement from a local store, and I'm throwing this shower head in the trash.Greatly disappointed in Amazon, and what can only be abhorrent quality control at the presumably Chinese factory from which this came."
4,finally feels like we have pressure,"This is our third showerhead attempt. Moved into a house with very low pressure in the shower. Tried two other shower heads and one was okay, but took a long time to rinse hair out. The other one we tried had to be returned immediately, as the water literally only dripped out. This one works great on one of the settings, and so we're very happy with it. The pulse setting and one of the others doesn't really work out due to our pressure, but I understand from other reviews that we could pop something out of the head to allow more water through to make it work better. However, we're happy with the one setting, and do want to conserve water, so we will use it as-is. Some others said the hose was unwieldy, but I thought it was the perfect length."
3,Good showerhead for the $$,"For a cheap showerhead, this is acutally a good product. It is all lightweight plastic and the hose is very stiff. No attempt was made to make the bracket that holds it look like brushed nickel, its just a grey plastic."
2,Disappointment,This hand-held shower head doesn't have the usual force associated with a shower. The massage is weak and not at all invigorating. I am not happy with this purchase.
3,Was amazing until it broke,"I really liked this product. The pressure was nice, and I used most of the different settings, but after 5 months of use, it one day just broke off of the pipe. I reattached it, and it did the same thing the next day while I was taking a shower. The plastic threads inside of the product that hold it to the pipe seem to be quite soft and have stripped.I will not be buying this product again, unfortunately."
2,Disappointed,"The only good setting on this head forms a too tightly-focused shower. The mist setting is too wide. The flow is slow, even with the regulator removed. The hose is not long enough. I was disappointed that the head does not pivot up and down, only sideways. However, it was very easy to install, not costly and it looks nice."
3,No Pause Feature,"Please note that this shower head does NOT have a pause setting -- unlike what is indicated in the product information chart. This was actually one of my main desires when I purchased this shower head, so I'm planning on installing a shut-off valve.The hose is still kinked from being wound up tightly in the package, which I'm hoping will work itself out. Right now it is currently jutting out into the shower and gets in the way a bit.Other than that it's a decent shower head. The water pressure is satisfactory and it seems reasonably high in quality for the price."
1,Completely malfunctioning piece of junk,"This item spewed water from the ball valve connection and no water reached the shower head itself, no matter how tight the ball valve connection was tightened. In fact the tighter it was, the harder it was to swivel the unit on the ball. Tightened all connections as much as I dared; tried toggling the water saving trickling button. Nothing solved the problem. It is going back and I'm done experimenting with Water Pik. If I could have given it zero stars, I would have."
1,Poor quality,We never actually got to use the product. The connectors were made of plastic. The cheap China made product broke as we were assembling it. I would research hand held shower heads made with metal parts. Inferior product.
2,Waterpik 5 Mode???,Description says 5 mode - I find only 3 modes and it cuts water pressure. But it looks good and keeps me clean!
3,Good for the money,"For the price paid this showerhead is OK. Seems well constructed, even if plastic and works fine with our hard water.Price was cheaper than I could get locally, even with shipping"
2,"After 10 months of use, not so great","I've been using Waterpik's for years. My initial impression of this model was that it seemed very light, and therefore of lower quality than other Waterpik's I've owned.After 10 months of use, I'm not happy with how it has held up. The water is emitted from small rubber openings -- some of which have distorted so that water sprays off to the side. On mine, one stream now sprays towards my eyes. I'll probably have to replace it before long, so I can't recommend this item."
3,Quality leaves something to be desired.,"It works well and was easy enough to install. I was disappointed to find that it's not metal as it's made to look, but instead is metal-plated plastic resin. Worse, the metal plating had bubbles under it which had begun to flake off. It's functional, but do not get this if you're concerned about aesthetics. Spend a few bucks more and get something better made. If you just want a multi-function showerhead that works and you don't care about looks, go for it."
3,caring and green,"Waterpik TRS-559 Elements 5-Mode Handheld Shower, Brushed NickelI bought this shower head because it supposedly had all the features I wanted. Unfortunately it did not. The website reported that it had a 'water pause' setting. It did not. It had a 'misting spray' instead. I am disabled and it takes me a long time to get cleaned up. I don't need the shower on when I'm soaping up or washing my hair, etc., it is just wasting water during that time. That is why I purchased this in the first place.All of the Waterpic shower heads claim to have this feature. I wonder how many of them actually do.It is a lot of trouble for me to get this shower head installed and now I have to get it uninstalled and replace it with another shower head.I am NOT happy with this situation!If you are water-conscious as I am I would recommend looking elsewhere for a hand-held shower head."
4,"Not what I had hoped for, but it works.","The unit was easy to install, when the water is turned on it squirts out the shower head, it is adjustable and works good, what else can I say? The only thing is I like high pressure, if you have similar desires step up to the DSL653 and you will be much happier. I cannibalized the TRS 553 for a few parts to get my old 653 working again, all is good."
3,Mixed results/satisfaction,"This replaces an older model Water Pik hand-held. I wanted a new type of head that was easier to adjust on the fly, so to speak, and I got it with this one. Completely satisfied on that count.What is not so satisfying is the stupid, cheap, inflexible hose that comes with this model. Whoever made that design decision should be fired, or sent to oversee plant operations in China, Mexico, Bangladesh, or wherever.Ease of installation was pretty high. Value for the money is about average."
2,Not that great,"Ours puts out TOO much water- emptying our hot water heater in just a few minutes, yet the massage spray feels feeble compared with our old showerhead. I guess they don't make them like they used to.It will be replaced."
3,Buddhist basics,"This is a good basic explanation of Buddhism, but is not, as noted above, very well written. It is supposed to be distributed free of charge and if you search for the title you'll find a free version you can dl."
5,Nice picture,Okay we have had the TV for five week now and are very happy with the overall quality. It is a sharp looking and well performing set. The picture is good even though we have not yet spent the bucks to upgrade our Dish to HD reception. The volume was a concern given the other reviews and since we were pputting it in our busy kitchen. Its no boom box but the sound is adequate.
5,Professor Beal,"I have had the privilege of being one of Prof. Beal's students at Eckerd College. We used this book as one of our textbooks for a course on biblical literature. Beal is a true feminist and an excellent biblical interpreter. His findings in this book show that the gender issues and other prejudices that plague our modern day society have their roots thousands of years before us. By using the book of Esther as his main source, Beal shows that a biblical book is capable of holding just as much injustice as others hold justice. I would recommend this book to any feminist, or anyone interested in fighting prejudices of any kind."
5,Amazing product,"I first came across this product when working as a doctor's assistant at UCLA Medical Center 19 years ago, as they had these bottles in the restroom. I kept a sample bottle, waiting for the day that I could find it. (Back then, internet commerce wasn't as popular or user-friendly. Now, years later, I'm able to do a search and find this product for sale and thus ordered it.) This really works in eliminating bad (body) odors wafting in the air."
5,For exigent music fans,"I like this dvd. It is really good, considering they included 6 songs from an Oct 87 show at Shoreline.The Summer 90 performance here is good. Before I get further into explaining 'good' i must say the band looks a bit lazy. But in good spirits. Since my other favorite band is Yes, I am used to seeeing more interaction between the musicians. But don t get me wrong. I saw 6 GD shows and own 1000 hrs of their material (as an enthusiast) and the interaction that they would engage in normally was darn good.The China Cat > rider is a strong point. Also the Baby Blue encore. Additonally Big boss man is great to see in a year where it didn t get much rotation.Big River is also a standout.Furthermore the opener LTGTR > trucking is much full of energy.It would be nice if GD productions would release some more 'vintage' material (if it exists). I and others would be really thrilled to see some 1971 or '72 material on video.Thanks."
4,GHOST IS NOT SCARY,"For those who have seen THE SIXTH SENSE (Out now at cinemas) but not GHOST, it follows the same style. Ghost is an emotional tearjerker which keeps your eyes on the tv screen. I think all the actors did really well and i enjoyed the scenes where revenge was taken on the baddies. A must-watch for those who enjoy romantic, good storylines with a hint of action. A classic"
4,"Romantic, ghost story thriller","Patrick Swayze and Demi Moore star in this movie as a couple who are very happy with their life and have just moved into a new apartment. Patrick's character is killed early in the movie - but that isn't the last you see of him! He is the ghost the movie is named after. He tries to find out who killed him and then realizes his girlfriend is in great danger. She doesn't believe in the afterlife, so when Patrick recruits a spiritual medium played by Whoopi Goldberg to convince her to listen, it takes some doing. It also takes some doing to keep Whoopi involved, which makes for a funny yet suspenseful movie as the danger of the bad guy gets worse."
2,Blue Ray is good...........but not great.,"This classic stands up well. There are some nice additions to this BR-Disc such as interviews from the time the movie was made which are a little haunting when Patrick Swayze appears for his insight. So, the special features are enough to lure you in more about this movie and it 's background.The Blue Ray transfer either could have been better or it was as good as it was going to get. The clarity is soft (but improved from the DVD version)and blacks are okay. The color match up well but are not instant by first notice. The audio is decent as well. So, if you are interested for Blue Ray reasons? It is a nice investment to your collection ongoing or just starting out.But, I strongly suggest to first check out either [...] or Blue Ray Digest for a more well thought out review of this classic."
2,A fine time to be ladylike,"Whoopy Cushion, uh, Goldberg is very funny in GHOST but beyond her, the film's entertainment value plummets. Why? Demi Moore's character is so darn stupid. The scene that blew it for me: she stands there in frozen panic watching the murder of her boyfriend. You won't even run for help, Dummy, uh, Demi? Just hang around gawking as Patrick Swayze gets killed. It reminded me of those ""Superman"" episodes where thugs would beat the heck out of Jimmy Olsen while Lois Lane stood there like a wax figure. Women!"
5,Beautiful,"This was an amazingly beautiful movie!Very good for people like me who like tearjerkers. It was funny, thrilling, and enchantingly romantic and sad in one movie! Demi Moore, Whoopi Goldberg, and Patrick Swayze all do an excellent job in portraying their respective characters. Wonderful movie for almost anyone (especially with the Holidays coming so soon!)."
2,Soothing Music to Fall Asleep To?,"I purchased this cd with the impression that I could use it to help me with falling asleep. However I wasn't happy with the disc upon using it. It is the sounds of a whale, but it is on a roll, seemingly over and over again, the same sounds. I didn't feel it helped me at all!"
3,A Good Introduction,"I would have loved more detail and depth. I think the author knows some rich kind of stories that can't be shown in time lines etc but he doesn't bring them forth here. It's those tales that make history a living breathing reality. I saw him speaking live from Cowpens on a C-Span Booknotes program and was intrigued enough to purchase a copy. I felt he has enthusiasm for the subject but perhaps didn't grapple successfully enough with the format of presenting it in both a factual and off-the-cuff manner. At any rate, it was enlightening for me as a person who had always thought of the American Revolution mostly being about the New England colonies to learn otherwise. Speaking as one of the uniniated on the subject, I felt it was a fairly good doorway to the next level."
3,Quite a few wrong answers on the test questions,"The book is very good, but the test questions contains quite a few errors. I gave it three stars because I bought this book mainly for the hundreds of test questions. I have three other Citrix books and this book is more detailed but a little less readable. I would rate the book a four star on book alone."
3,A good source.,"I thought this book was a good source for passing the Metaframe 1.8 exam. Although it didnt seem to cover all the points, its good enough to pass the test. I thought it was a bit weak on the topic of load balancing (which came up on my exam atleast 4 times)."
1,Luck I know what i'm doing...,"This book was a horrible study guide. Although I passed the exam, there were plenty of discrepancies in the book, along with just plain wrong information. It's a good thing that I had been working on Citrix for some time before I took the test!"
3,"Good exam guide, but not perfect","A a Citrix Certified Instructor and CCEA, I welcome this bookto help new Citrix admins past the exam. This book is actually betterthan the standard training book coming from Citrix and is certainlycheaper. The questions aren't always up-to-date, but overall it'sok...The combination of this book and some on-hands experience withMetaframe is a sure bet to pass the CCA exam."
4,Maybe syngress is not all that bad after all...,"I developed a hatred for syngress after studying hard for the MCDBA, only to find that their book was based on the beta version and was more like a story than an informative guide. I was skeptical about trying another book from them, but being the only cca guide out there, and seeing the other ratings made me take the chance. All that being said, the book is right on for the exam, and the questions on the CD were a big help. I passed the exam with flying colors due to my experience, and help from this book."
3,The REEL story hasn't been filmed yet,"I am a resident of Buffalo, Johnson County, Wyoming. I've seen this movie as well as ""Heaven's Gate"" and ""In Old Cheyenne"" all of which supposedly dealt with the ""Johnson County War"" of 1892. This version is a well-acted western and enjoyable entertainment but I must plead with the reader to not believe this movie has anything to do the titled incident. It's worth getting to add to your ""westerns"" collection or if you're a fan of Burt Reynolds or Tom Berenger. But Don't get it if you want to learn about the real Johnson County War...that version hasn't been filmed yet."
2,Cowboy at Heart,"I was disappointed with this movie. I loved Tom Berenger in Last of the Dogmen, which although a bit soapy was fun to watch. This movie, because of the script, dress and acting left me cringing. At the same time I also watched Toshiro Mifume in several samurai movies. The old black and white movies enveloped me because of the acting and authenticity of the experience. Johnson County War seems to have been made by people that do not really understand the classic western. This could have been much better than it actually is.Johnson County War"
4,WESTERN POWERFUL SAGA AT ITS BEST!!,"but why be so lousy and do not add at least english subtitles? would have worthed full five stars, but without subtitles the viewer is left at the mercy of the actors, not always so clear in their speaking!"
3,the battle of good and evil,I saw this movie yesterday. It had some good music in it. However they could have toned up the action and intensity alot more than they did. A word of warming this has some scary scenes and mild carton violence in it. Should be fine for 7 and up. In this movie the evil goblins plan to flood the tunnel killing the miners to get revenge for being driven under ground. If that wasn;t worse enough the evil goblin prince plans to enslave the surface dwellers known as the Sunland People by capturing and marrying the young beautiful 12 year old princes Ireny. Can the princess and a local pesant boy stop there evil plane. Only time will tell.
1,Product is fine but the service stinks,"I ordered one of these for each of my 2 cars. The one for the Town Car is great, but they sent me the wrong one for the second car. I contacted them and am STILL waiting to hear from the company about getting the correct one."
5,The Best of Oregon,Ashland area in Oregon could be considered as one of the most beautiful places covered by other great movies like this one. Lithia Park was truly a great landmark to focus the footage of the movie. Every detail of the movie was really amusing making it really worth watching for.
3,More To Ashland,"The video is very nice but didn't show most of Ashland. It kept showing the same area/park over and over again. I would have gone a bit further. Perhaps, made it a little more personal. A little more inviting. However, I like the personal touch of the autographed pic from the producer!Good luck to you."
4,"This is a DVD, NOT a VHS!!!","Amazon will probably get around to fixing this listing, but just in case they don't, I'll post this as a review to get the word out. I was looking for this movie on DVD anyway, so I was actually glad to get a DVD copy rather than a VHS tape. This movie is a must-have for any Terence Hill/Bud Spencer fans. It has always been difficult to locate this film on DVD (even now since Amazon currently has it listed as VHS format). This is indeed in DVD format from WHAM! the same company that released the DVD copy of ""Watch Out, We're Mad"" (Another great Terence Hill/Bud Spencer film). ""I'm for the Hippopotamus"" isn't quite up there with ""Watch Out, We're Mad"", but still a good flick nonetheless."
3,Crazy jungle movie,"This film starring Terence Hill and Bud Spencer,is a classic comic adventure.Though most of the fight scenes have been seen a dozen times.Overall,it's a bit repetative,but still a classic slapstick film."
1,junk,i purchaed this program to design my deck.All it does is create a picture.I used to have a program that designed a deck and also gave me a break down of materials to build it and accurate dimensions in which to cut my lumber and also a walk through the construction.This program [punch]does nothing like that at all.If anyone wants to build a deck using this program they are wating there money.
1,Complete intellectual bankruptcy,"After concluding this work, the only description that comes to mind is the title of this review, otherwise known as, a complete waste of time. The authors totally ignore the military/political realities facing a numerically inferior side, choosing instead to concentrate on a flawed mathematical ""analysis"" that is not only laughable, but also totally at odds with the immutable principles of war."
1,Karen Parnell,I have say that I was shocked to find my account was debted (...)5. I thought I was a very good shopper but Video Professor showed me different. I am now fighting a nightmare to stop payments. This company has found a way to scam the public. What will it take to stop this? My fear of shopping on line has just become real.
1,Scam Artist of the Lowest Kind,Beware of this guy....he will send you unwanted videos and keep charging your credit card $70/month month after month....no customer service to respond to complaints ...will report this scumbag to better business bureau
1,Do not order from this company!!!,"I ordered the Original Wrist Rocket Slingshot with Brace on December 8, and that time, it was pictured with a molded integrated handle grip. The item shipped was like the one now pictured. When I emailed the company about returning it, they changed the photo, then told me if the item was like the photo, they would charge me a 15% restocking fee. I am taking action againt this vendor."
2,Cheaply made sling shot,The bands seem like they will break after little use. The metal frame seems to be made out of a light metal so it doesn't have a strudy feel.
1,Very disappointed!,"Let me begin this review by saying that I have a rare condition that causes all slingshots to look like cucumbers to me. Despite this fact, I was still very disappointed to open up my package from Amazon and discover that I had received a slingshot, not a cucumber. It looked EXACTLY like a cucumber in the photo on the website. Yes, I know I have a condition that causes me to see cucumbers in the place of slingshots, but I was so sure that this one was a cucumber, not a slingshot. I mean, look at the photo on the Amazon website - that's a cucumber, right? Amazon should not put a picture of a cucumber on the product page of a slingshot. If it's a slingshot, put a picture of a slingshot. Not a cucumber. It's very confusing!"
3,fun with a purpos,i havent bought this but it looks good to me!!!!!!! i dont know why that other guy couldnt grip the handle. so what if the hanle is rubber coated!
5,fun,this sling shot is a lot of fun. its simple design makes it so much fun. marbles are the best projectile for it.
2,Disappointed,The item was not as pictured. Instead of a hard ergonomic plastic handle as shown in the picture I received a thick rubber hose drawn over metal framing. This made it very hard to get a good grip of the slingshot. Very disappointed. Shipping time was O.K.
5,I'll bet this works great...,"...in the hands of someone who's got decent aim. I tried for a solid 15 minutes to hit a gallon milk jug 15 feet away. Have you ever read the ""Clan of the Cave Bear"" books? (Yes, I know, that's a sling, and this is a slingshot. Shhh.) If Ayla's on one end of the sling/slingshot spectrum, I'm on the other. Still, except for the part where I have to wander the backyard, grubbing for rocks (why do we have no rocks in the backyard?), this is a super fun... toy? Piece of sporting equipment? Gadget? Whatever. I'm probably not ever going to be bringing down a brace of ptarmigan with it, but someday, I am going to kill that milk jug DEAD."
3,Audubon Cedar Bluebird box,"The customer needs to be aware that just because the word Audubon appears in the name of this box that does not mean that the National Audubon Society has recommended this box for cavity nesters. The better place to look for a box recommendation is at the North American Bluebird Society or any of its State affiliates.These folks work exclusively with cavity nesting birds and are a better source of good up to date information. This, front opening box, is perfectly OK for any cavity nester. Nothing wrong with it at all. Cedar is a preferred wood because it lasts longer. And the price is good as well. I simply wanted to set the record strait as one reviewer said she would expect nothing less than good from Audubon. Anyone can use that name on their products as it has never been Trademarked or copywrited."
4,Better built than the similar ones at Lowe's or WalMart,"I wondered what was different about this one vs. the ones at Lowe's or WalMart, so I bought both to compare. This one from Amazon/Woodlink is made of 3/4"" cedar. The one from the box stores is only 1/2"" cedar. This one uses long, strong construction screws to hold it together. The one from the box stores only uses narrow staples. I will give credit to the model from the box stores for being made of smooth, red cedar -- the color of a typical cedar chest. This one was more rough, unfinished, white cedar. The only reason I did not give this 5 stars was because the roof was cracked and a piece fell off. I chose not to return it because I was able to glue the piece back on by myself."
4,An Interesting Solo Album,"Roger Taylor. The second best singer in Queen (of course, Freddie is the best) and one of the best and underrated drummers in rock 'n' roll. Here he shows his rhythum guitar playing abilities, as well as his wide musical song-writing range."
1,....,"Roger formed The Cross during a ""down time"" in Queen's recording schedule. This first offering is dismal.It relies heavily on weak, synth-like drum machines and samples (mostly of older Queen tunes.)The only track worth getting into is the original release of ""Heaven For Everyone"" (later redone by Queen.) This version, with Roger on lead vocals, is well done and is surprisingly close to the Queen version. There is a vocal bridge that I wish Queen would've kept in and the song is done in the ""self help"" vain...it begins with a soothing voice over with a man urging you to ""close your eyes and imagine soft, white clouds..""""Love Lies Bleeding"" has a catchy guitar riff courtesy of guesting Brian May but all in all, this is Euro pop at it's worst."
2,Broke,Hammer has a good feel and is the perfect size. I bought it to use at work but the handle broke off after using it the second time.
4,Former Benny Goodman canarie is wonderful...,"Yes that's right she perched with Benny Goodman's Orchestra, and she sounds as great as ever on her own singing standrds, and swinging wonderfully... Recomended."
4,Worth the effort,"It took quite a bit of persuading to get my cat to play with this chew toy. But once he got the idea, it was great."
5,My kitties love these!,"Like any cat toy, these are small enough to get lost under furniture and such. But my kittens and cats love these! I have even washed them (in a lingerie bag so the washer doesn't eat them), and they seemed to wash up pretty well."
3,Improved material but still mediocre,"I saw Grease on stage and hated it but when the film came out with Olivia Newton John (who I had a crush on), I had to see it.Unfortunately, there was not a lot of improvement. The film is set in 1959. Rock n roll is just making its influence felt. This film is about those who embraced rock n roll as their lifestyle. A sort of bad musical version or the Blackboard Jungle meets Gidget.The only truely positive thing I can say about this film is a fantastic performance by Stockard Channing. She proved early that she was a rare breed. An actor that can be good despite the material!The musical score ranges from very good to very mediocre. If you like the songs, get the music videos from the film.The book / screenplay is very thin. This is not a film for the musical conneisuer."
4,Grease VHS,"I purchased two a the ""Grease"" movies for my granddaughters, they were very pleased. Thank you"
3,Rydell Grease questionable,The movie is always great.I can't access the special features of this DVD.
5,very nice,"this was a good movie, with good sound and good picture, and the price was right, glad I bought it"
5,grease,Ordered this as a christmas present and my daughter loved it. I purchase it at a reasonable price and am please with my purchase.
2,How can you have a movie about rock and roll...,"with no black people in it anywhere? How does that work, exactly? As for the movie, pedestrian, high school theater fodder. There it is."
2,WHAT HAPPENED????????????????,"Grease is one of the best movies of the '70's. No doubt about that.WHAT HAPPENED PARAMOUNT?????The movie is great as always but the DVD edition is badly dissapointing. The dolby soundtrack is better on the 20th Anniversary Edition I bought a few years ago.I am VERY dissapointed in the quality I have of this. I will keep it just because it is the DVD of the movie. But for watching, I'll bring out the old 20th Anniversary VHS edition.Hope Paramount does better with Saturday Night Fever and Footllose."
5,Great Movie!,The item arrived very quickly. It was just what I had hoped it would be. This is one of my all-time favorite musicals and I am very happy to now own it.
5,Great movie,I was very impressed with the amount of extras on the blu-ray. For Grease lovers this is a must have. My teenage cousins get a kick out of the karaoke function on all the songs. It was a hit at their recent sleepover.
3,NO LEATHER JACKET ALSO !,"Same problem as a previous customer. The DVD came without any ""T-Birds"" leather jacket sleeve the 1st time... and the 2nd time. I and the customer service I talked to assumed that the whole batch was without these cool jackets. I wish there would be a way to check the DVD in the warehouse, and then correct the problem with the initial supplier.Besides this problem, the DVD itself was awesome!"
3,A Classical,"Grease is great movie for all ages. Its funny and entertaining and you will learn to love the songs that are featured in it. Don't miss the opportunity, and get. It's a classical that you'll want to have for ever."
5,Omg I LOVE this movie!!!!!!,"I swear this is one of the best movies of allllll time...my parents had this movie when I was a baby and I wanted to watch it all the time! Now I'm putting it on my birthday wishlist for my 13th birthday in a few months...I never, ever get tired of watching it either. This is kinda a ""classic"" too, so BUY IT!"
4,Got it for my wife,"She is a Grease fanatic, and this was a good one for her.sheloves it.it also has a karaoke part but does require a USB micraphone"
5,Love it...,"Got this in time to surprise my daughter with it, and she was very excited to receive it. She had been asking for it for months!"
1,TRASH,Newton-john lost her lawsuit (as usual) to try to get more money from this stupid movie. I guess the courts don't think she's so great. And well... this movie is what the title says it is- total trash. The Grease reunion was a bunch of old worn out people trying to act young again- it was really pathetic. I hope kids these days have something more to aspire to than the idiots in this film.
5,My favorite musical!,"This is my favorite musical of all time. So glad I was able to find it here because I tried looking for it in the stores and wasn't successful, especially at a reasonable price! :) Give 'em hell Rydell! :)"
1,Spent my money,"for the promising title, I bought the book immediately after the release. I hoped to find much about the web technologies, esp. JSP applications, but found only 50 pages telling the same thing with the help files. Again waiting for another release of JDeveloper for a new book.. I think the book is specially written for the Developer users for the migration, it has far missing topics.."
5,Gotta have it.,"I grew up hearing these songs at Christmas time. Warm memories. Christmas would not be the same without hearing Buck! My all time favorite Christmas songs. During the 70's, my parents would play both Buck Owens Christmas albums all day for weeks before Christmas."
5,Memories!,"I have wonderful Christmas memories of my mom when I was a child. I couldn't wait for the Christmas season to arrive so I could play the record of Buck Owens. My mom and I would play it over and over. Our favorite song was ""Daddy Looked a lot Like Santa"". I'm so glad I found it after all these years. I'm buying it as a gift for my mom."
3,Not as good as the first Christmas album.,"The reissue of this album on CD will undoubtedly be welcomed by those who had the original LP and enjoyed it. For the rest of us, well...it's just not as good as his first Christmas album. I have enjoyed the first (""Christmas With Buck Owens"") for years, and although I didn't expect this second release to be nearly as great, it was still a disappointment when hearing it at last. The songs are performed very well by the band, but they seem mundane compared to the first album, and Tom Brumley's steel guitar is remarkably restrained. There's really not a lot of memorable song material here. His first album seemed bright and warm; this one just seems to lack the Christmas spirit."
1,NOT A MOBB BANGER!!!!!!!!,"I DON'T KNOW WHAT WAS WORSE THE INFAMY ALBUM OR THIS! O.K. WITH THIS ALBUM YOU DIDN'T GET ANY RB JOINTS, BUT STIL THIS ALBUM LACKED SOMETHING.IT DIDN'T HAVE THAT OLD MOBB FEEL EXCEPT:(1)THE INTRO,(2)TRACK 1-SO...SO,& TRACK (3),AND THE SWEETEST SONG ON THERE WAS ""I DON'T GIV A ...."" I THINK THIS IS TRACK (11), ANYWAY THE SAME DAY I BOUGHT IT, IS THE SAME DAY IT WENT BACK......ON THE SHELF WHERE IT BELONGS! ONEESKAEL"
2,Ultimately unsatisfying,"While the plot is full of twists and turns, the characters never emerge beyond the two-dimesional. The author sets up complex relationships between the heroine and her father and daughter, but never develops them at all. The plot has large holes in it; the heroines actions are often inexplicable except in terms of advancing the plot. For example, a policeman comes to her door after her house has been ransacked and her daughter is missing, yet she fails to enlist his help, so that she can be alone when the killer attacks...So many threads of plot are left hanging that the story seems abandoned rather than concluded. Thumbs down."
2,"two kid, two zens...two broken zens","My daughter bought the 2 GB and about a month later the screen went black but would still play. It quit altogether eventually. Not sure what happened.This one I ordered for my other daughter and she is also having problems. It is stuck on one song, frozen and wont play. Trying to contact company...we'll see how that goes."
2,Player for a Year...,"This is very nice little gadget here (maybe even too small for me). It sounds fantastic, the earphones are pretty good, so is the radio. Video player though is useless. It is promised to have 15 hour battery life?! Might be so, but with embedded Lithium ion battery it is 40 % less a year from now. Since the battery is not replaceable, lifespan of the player is only few years. Before you buy, consider that after the battery is worn-out, so is the the player."
1,Never again!!!,"Two years ago I bought a Zen Nano Plus for my son. He wanted something that would hold more music so I bought him a Zen V 1 gb. Within two weeks it froze up on him and he couldn't use it. I was able to bring it back to where I had bought it. Then I upgraded even more and bought a Zen V. 4 gb. After less than two months that froze up on my son and he hasn't been able to get it to work since. Meanwhile, he gave me his old Zen Nano Plus, which is still plugging along.I don't think I will buy a Zen again, until they fix this problem."
1,I hate this peeler.,"I lost my Pampered Chef vegetable peeler in a break-up/separation. I think I was sadder to lose the peeler than the boyfriend, to be honest.Anyhoo, I replaced it with what I thought would be the best-ever vegetable peeler: the OXO swivel.The serrated blade on this peeler makes it the most annoying kitchen implement I own. I am constantly picking peel out of the blade as it gets stuck in the teeth. The handle feels ok to hold onto I guess, but its poor performance negates any user-comfort. I absolutely have to get something else - every time I go to make a dish that requires peeled veggies I audibly sigh at the thought of breaking out the OXO.I recommend a peeler with a smooth blade. Like my Pampered Chef peeler. <sob> wherever that dumb boyfriend is now i hope he is enjoying THE BEST PEELER I EVER OWNED."
1,This is a really awkward peeler,"It is very uncomfortable.Too thick to hold, too gentle too peel.More like a toy that an appliance."
4,"Nice, but the handle disintegrates",A nice and easy to use peeler. My only complaint/qualm is that the rubber handle parts do disintegrate over the span of a couple of years when washed regularly in our dishwasher. Not a big problem for a roughly $8 item.
2,Decent Peeler,"Pros:- it peels well- the handle is sturdy, convenient, and protective (i.e. I never cut myself)- it is machine-washableCons:- no pitter! (i.e. no device to scoop out little ugly divets in potatoes, for example... this is a major ""con,"" as other peelers have this feature... Some may argue that this peeler DOES have a ""pitter"" at the tip, but honestly that plastic scoop-shape tip doesn't do much)- price (it should be cheaper given the lack of a pitter)Recommendation:- buy a different peeler; one with the same type of handle, but an additional ""pitter"" (a good one) at the tip"
1,"""More Convenient"", My Foot!","Aaargh! Whoever it was that came up with the bright idea to graft a swiveling cutting blade onto a veggie peeler musta been some kinda sadist! Or he might've been the same guy who invented the pivoting-head shaver, and thought he could apply it to other household gadgets with a similar degree of success. In any case, I've no clue why this so-called ""innovation"" is considered a convenience. The moving cutter tends to slip quite a bit, causing uneven peeling and skipping on whatever I'm skinnin' for dinner (usually a spud or a cuke). It takes me twice as long to peel something with this implement that would've been done a lot faster and with much better results had I simply used a fixed-blade implement. Which is what I'm gonna stick with, by the way. You gotta go with what works, after all...`Late"
3,"Okay peeler, watch your digits","This peeler works okay but you need to be careful when using it, it's very sharp and a little awkward to use. I prefer my old, basic peeler over this. While using it last night, I managed to take a good chunk of the tip of my finger off with it while peeling potatoes."
5,Worked Great!,"I have never owned a potato peeler before, I've always used a paring knife. My hands hurt everytime I would use my paring knife so I searched and found this and ordered it. I LOVE IT! My hands don't hurt anymore and it does a great job!"
3,"OK, but the Rada is much better","I bought this peeler years ago and didn't think much of a peeler. I had issues with the handle sliding back occasionally while using, handle filling with water and getting smelly and peels getting stuck in the ""D"" design, making it a bit annoying to clean. The handle being fat, to me, is clumsy to use and takes up too much space in the drawer. I really had to push hard to get the fat plastic eye remover to dig into the potato.One day it was missing, never to be found again. I knew I wasn't going to order that one again and I found the Rada peeler for about the same price. The blade is stainless steel, super sharp (Sharper than the OXO), the eye remover is fantastic, the handle is small and light aluminum. I find because it is not so bulky, the work is much lighter and quicker. It looks much better, is way easer to clean, and takes up practically no space in the drawer."
1,cutting area too small,"I just purchased this one, and after 1st use, cut my finger. ""Why?"" might you ask, because the area is too small that you peel with. It is inset between the parts that hold the blade. This MIGHT be good for carrots, but if you have a large potato or one with a flat side, it is very ineffective."
3,Binding,I can't speak to the quality of the recipes in this book (although they look good) because the last two copies I have received have broken their binding immediately and pages began falling out. Both copies have been returned. There is something wrong with the current batch at amazon.
3,Lively techno artist/re-mix album,"And away we go - boom, tch, boom, tch - with the floor-friendly Lifestyle by Reck, whom we suspect is Nils Hess. One right on album in the bin already, it's time for solo work; here eight pieces and a grab of remixes are served for those wanting it reliably rhythmic without pounding-gabba filler.Certainly Reck knows to lead strong, ""Silkworm Spinning,"" shows a deftly relaxed approach to building a track, eight minutes floating by before the Pascal FEOS take whips in. ""Dragons Turning"" glides up and down over three different variations, while cuts such as ""Bon Voyage"" prove you can keep it restrained yet lively.Though the back half has dips, Lifestyle certifiably feeds the techno craving, rising over many mixes pouring into the commercial stream. Sure, reality says most of you won't pick up a tech-disc that doesn't have ""Moonshine"" or ""Carl Cox"" slapped on the cover, but go ahead and add an actual artist album into the cart. We won't tell the DJs."
4,Nesbit: An Author of wonder!,"The reason I only gave this book 4 stars is because of out of the 5 Edith Nesbit Books I have read so far...this is my least favourite. I think it is beacuase of how it is written. It, to me, was lacking something all the other books she wrote have. I also did not particularly enjoy the beginning of the book, as it started out dull etc. But as it went on...I fell in love with the four children. One thing that is very evident in this book is the thing of good magic. Evrything thing seems to be filled with it, therefore making the story all the better and all more exciting. I loved how it showed each of there adventures, and each of there luck with the magic ring. I also got a few laughs out of the children's injinuity. This is truly a classic, but not my favourite Nesbit book. It certainly is worth getting though."
5,Wonderful!,A wonderful tale by E. Nesbit great for children of any age! Imaginative as are all of E. Nesbit tales.
4,Very Good just like the rest of the Series,"I really liked it, because almost all of my favorite characters were there. It was very dramatic and really pulls you in after the first couple of pages and you can't put in down because you want to know what happens to Bean, Petra and the rest of Ender's crew from the 3rd invasion. Both Bean and Petra come back but they are older and try tp fit back into their old lives where it seems they might not beable to. You meet Peter Wiggin(Locke) and the Parents of the Wiggin kids."
2,annoying flaw for kindle users,"I haven't yet finished this book, but so far it is pretty good. However, all of my enjoyment is ruined by turning each page. every time you turn the page the words are either a sentence ahead or behind where the previous page ended,forcing you to constantly search for your place over and over again.I wish i could give this book a better review. And i might, after i get a refund for the ebook and buy a real one."
2,why i think this is a good book,"Why I think this book and others in this series are good is simple. They kept my attention. I am a sixteen year old girl that when I get bored I want a good book to curl up with no distractions and I totally get lost in the charecters and thats what happened when I read, not only this book but all of the ENDER books, I got lost for hours on end. With Bean having to save his friends, nobody quite knowing whats going on, and the budding romance between him and the only girl in BATTLE SCHOOL to have fought in the Bugger wars. A good end. Or is it a new beginning...? To this the bean segment of the series. I don't know about anyone else who's read these books but i hope he comes out with more of them maybe Enders children...?"
1,SIGH,"What a huge disappointment. Ender's shadow was a great read. Shadow of the hegemon was an utter waste of time. Im an avid Orson Scott Cart fan, but with the exception of the Alvin Maker series, he's not the greatest sequel writer."
3,I love Card's stuff... usually,"This book just isn't up to Orson's standards. The first five chapters are very interesting, but the rest of it is just boring boring BORING. Unless you are really into world history (especially with Thailand and India and Pakistan and that whole area), or you are willing to put up with boring discussions about military operations that aren't very exciting in the first place, just wait for this book to come out on paperback."
4,"Great Writing, Excellent Narrators - Jolting edits","First let me clarify that I loved the writing and the assorted narrators. I discounted a star on this audio version for the poor editing. I can only assume that the word Hegemon was mispronounced throughout the book and the ""patch"" used to insert the correct pronunciation is a bit jolting. It does not sound as though it was recorded with the same equipment and I'm not sure if it's even the same narrator. For those of us who like to be totally immersed in the story - it will jolt you back to reality. The first couple of times I found it amusing but after that it became annoying. I think I would rather have had the mispronounced word rather than the jolting edits. I ended up listening to this audiobook while driving - I wasn't as immersed in the story and not as annoyed by the poor edits. From now on I will check the reviews of product from this company and will read the book myself rather than pay for a poorly edited audiobook."
2,Find time to read the book,"Most reviews I've read on this page address the book itself, not the audiobook. Not a mention of recording quality, production, or any aspects of the recording. Card mentions repeatedly at the end that audiobook is his preferred way to present his works, but if this is the best they come up with I disagree. FIND THE TIME TO READ THE BOOK. To me these little things in the recordings progressively became more annoying: the recording sounds very tinny, and for some reason ""the hegemon"" is recorded out of context?; continued mispronunciation of the antagonist throughout the book; and cheesy, poorly thought out musical ""interludes"" that become more invasive and jarring. Buy the used book and enjoy this great book for a fraction of the cost of this audiobook."
2,A Major Disappointment,"I'm a great fan of Card's ""Ender"" series, but this chapter falls far short of the standards he has established. Seems to me that Card is simply trying to beat a dead horse and write as many books as he can about the world of ""Ender's Game"", rather than expanding his scope and exploring fresh avenues.The premise of the novel - that the Battle School graduates would be kidnapped to help others plot military strategies - is 100% ridiculous. From this flaw, everything else goes downhill, and one can only hope that Card can do some serious CPR in order to revive the dead horse with what he says will be two more novels in the series."
4,"I haven't read it, but...","I had to do a book report two years ago. It was about Ender's Game, the first of Card's novels in this series. I then read the three books following it -- all the way through Children of the Mind. I fell in love with Card's writing style, and his characters, not to mention the thought provoking ideas that came with it. I then read Ender's Shadow which put a new twist on the Battle School. I loved it. This book, as a continuation of Ender's Shadow, brings to light the things Ender and Valentine's brother, Peter the Hegemon, did after his siblings started traveling. Better yet, it is from the point of view of non-settlers, the people on Earth. I keep trying to understand the universe of the pequeninos and the buggers, and this book helps describe the Earth of that universe."
5,and that's the rest of the story,"This book continues Card's great storytelling, dealing with many of the untouched aspects of the original story. It's great to see how Card works the problems of post-bugger Earth."
3,Unbelievable Characters,"When beginning to read ""Shadow"" it appears to make some sense, yet as you go on, it becomes too improbable to believe. The way that these brilliant children can manipulate adults and gain such status is irrational. And it appears to not have occured to Mr. Card that there must of have been other generations of brilliant children, who are now grown adults, probably in positions of power. The theory of the child that is smarter than anyone else holds up with Ender, because he is the only one. And it holds with Peter and Valentine, because they are his siblings. And it manages to hold with Bean, because he is genetically engineered, yet the idea that all of these children are more brilliant than any of the leaders of the world, who have the benefit of experience, is ridiculous. And I don't believe in the idea that experience closes the mind, because Ender and Bean are both very ""experienced,"" and yet still manage to look at situations with the same ingenuity."
4,"Small sander, big heart","While certainly not a workhorse spindle sander, the Grizzly G0538 delivers a smooth, reliable job. Changing spindles is quick and made handier with the spare spindle holders built into the base. The unit works fine as long as you don't force-feed your stock into the spindle. Let the tool do the work, and the results are pleasing."
1,SCREW THAT,omg dont buy this. its terrible. all the 1990's music has been replaced!!! WHY??? That is so stupid. i came so close to buying this dvd.. i am so glad i got out bidded on ebay. it was a close one! i am not cutting down the show.. the show was awesome. i mean the main reason i wanted it was to hear all the 1992ish songs! there is no reason to buy it now.. screw it! maybe they will come out with a better one later.
3,Great Show - Bad DVD,"I'm a big fan of the show and am glad to have it on dvd since MTV has stopped showing reruns in recent years. The special features (including the 20 minute commentary track) seem to be an after thought. The show deserves better - if you can get the episodes by some other means, I'd recommend that over spending money on this set."
4,A great time capsule,"I think that, whether you like it or not, MTV's ""The Real World"" could be viewed by distant lifeforms thousands of years from now, and I think they would get a pretty good sense of what being single, young, and independent in the early 90s in America was like. Each succesive RW has inevitably reflected the time it takes place (notice the succesive tolerance of class, race, sexuality from then to the new seasons). This show is much more interesting as a sort of sociological study of what the ""slacker"" and ""Gen X"" terms meant than as any real entertainment."
3,"Love the mag, dissapointed not receiving the magazine","I love this magazine and have began subscribing two years ago.The first two years I received the magazine fine, but the third year, I began to not get them.I'm very dissapointed, and can see from other Amazon customer's posts they have experienced the same dissapointment.I believe Amazon should check into this, as it seems to be happening on a frequent basis.UPDATE!!!!!! I searched Amazon's web site and finally found the number to call to check on this magazine. The number is: 800-772-8574. The person at this number said they would notify the magazine and they would send me the past issues that I did not receive.I will update once I receive mags."
5,Excellent,"This book is about family relationships, with all their complexities and frailties and strengths that extend beyond time. A family in crisis is the focal point, with the ailing father as the central figure. All members are going through a personal journey, facing hopes that may never be realized and the fears that go along with such revelation. How strong should be our commitment to one another as a family? What is ""fair"" in such a situation? Should this word even be brought into the discussion? This book will help you to reason that out. I am in a similar situation myself and this book made me think more clearly.Recommended for tweens to adults."
3,Can relate to this one so much,"Very well written in simple language. Having read Fine Balance I was searching for resemblances, can't find any. Even though set in the midst of a political turmoil, I think the novel is more about the people. This I think is not a story about the Hindu Muslim riots or about the Shivsainiks. This is about average people who are trying to make a living and their ambitions. The characters are aIl someone I can relate to. I was agonizing and depressed as I read through this."
1,"They look good, but they don't feel good.","I do not find these walking boots to be comfortable, as advertised. They look good, but they hurt my feet. I would like to return them, but I have worn them four or five times, thinking I would ""break them in"" and they would become comfortable. Hasn't worked so far."
4,Unglamorous,"Having spent a year in Cairo during the early 80s, I was recently, belatedly interested to see what this awarded novel has to offer. These interwoven, disparate stories of people living and working on a Cairo neighborhood street give us an unapologetic look at the less-than-saintly motives and methods that lie beneath the thin veneer of civilized culture worn by people everywhere; but these simultaneous stories are decidedly Cairene. If you want a feel-good book, look elsewhere. If you want keen, if somewhat cynical, insight into human nature as it curiously manifests itself in 1940s Egypt, you'll like this book. There seems to be an implied moral lesson, embodied in one of the characters, but not overstated so as to cause our eyes to roll. From the perspective of my own experiences in the same city four decades later, the novel seemed very real indeed."
1,unbelievable characters,Palace Street was a lot better.Midaq Alley had too many unbelievable paper thin characters and situations... A prostitute school...a person who deforms people's legs and arms to make them beggars...It reads like a Jacqueline Suzanne novel with none of the plot or suspense.Surely there are better Arabic writers.I hope so because I am studying the language.
3,"Turns dark hair ""darker""","Uhm, Turns dark brown hair darker. The pictures of haircolor on boxes are bs. They don't have enough powerto ""lift"" unless you have lighter brown hair.What I did like about this is the shine, smell wasn't too bad and it did not burn my scalp.I recommend for any dark haired (flaxen haired) Goddesses like myself, that if you want to usestore bought dyes consider using Feria 3x highlighting dye. I didn't buy it this time, because Ididn't like the colors they had at Target and Walgreens, but have used it before and it producesfabulous summer highlights! Garnier doesn't do ANYTHING or any of the other store bought dye's I'vetried. If you want ""lift"" you need to go to a professional."
2,Does not work with BlackBerry in stereo,"I wanted to use this to play music in my car, but it doesn't play out stereo. Good thing it was super cheap."
2,These people are slow----slow,I was satisfied with the product but the speed of delivery left alot to be desired.
1,Headphone Jack Adapter,Not very practical. Really cheesey connection. Every move of this adapter results in scratchy static noise.
2,Does not work with blackberry 2.5 mm interface,"After the fact I now see some folks that sell this same product clarify it will not work with a Blackberry-- this amazon listing does not state that. I received it and it is mono (not stereo) unless you insert it only half way into blackberry and wiggle it. So be careful and confirm your particular phone's compatability with a 2.5/3.5 adapter,"
4,Some Electropop Standouts of the Period,"""Love Theme"" and ""Seduction"" rate as probably two of the best pop-electronic film themes of the 80s, and, well, ""Call Me"" is just downright great. Why Giorgio bothered to squeal his way through ""Hello W.A.M."", I don't know. It hurt the end of the film, itself, and adds nothing to this soundtrack. ""Love and Passion"" - lyrics by director Paul Shrader - totally sum up the feelings of any intelligent person who has tried to live too long in Los Angeles.This dates very well because L.A. is STILL the L.A. of this film (1980) - fun, dangerous, superficial, materialistic - so take it along on your next trip and drive along the lonesome freeways with Moroder's hypnotic electrobeat propelling you along."
3,Least I can do,"I own this as an album. The only reason I purchased it was for the so-called 7 minute version of ""Nadir's Big Chance."" That cut, despite what the cd package says, is only 3:30, similar to the tune on Hammill's solo work of that title. As a VDGG fan, this was always the my least favorite recording in their catalog. I don't think the recording is that well done. Although when I first purchased the album, anything by VDGG was welcome. VDGG has better offerings such as ""Godbluff"" or ""Pawn Hearts."" If, like me, you want to hear an ""extended version"" of ""Nadir's Big Chance,"" buy Hammill's solo work of the same title which is better than ""Vital"" anyway."
1,"Worse than a ""b"" movie",Not worth the time and trouble. Wondering how any one could have fallen for that babysitter. Try Angel Blue for something in this same vein that is really a good movie.
2,This Book is Not The Correct View of the Intelectual Mind,"Living in Poland and Yugoslavia (where this book is mandatatory reading in gymnasiums, certain type of high schools) during the Iron Curtain period and during the fall of the B. Wall, I disagree that the theory in the book is correct. However, there were persons who could be associated with the certain personality types in the book, but to generalise in this way as Milos did is quite incorrect. For that I give the book two stars.I don't know how the other reviewers could compare reality with what they read in the book; but I guess to see it with your own eyes is the best way to test the things. Well, some say - he got the Nobel Prise so the book must be good picture of reality. To those I say, Henry Kissinger got the Nobel Prise for peace (!?) and it is well documented what kind of criminal person he is."
1,Do not use this book as a reference for the ChE PE Exam,"This book is a completely useless resource for the Chemical Engineering PE Exam. The format and layout of the book is clumsy and poorly structured. The errors in the text are frequent and in my judgement, completely unacceptable considering that the nature of the subject matter is a review for a professional engineer, which implies high standards and an even higher level of performance. The associated sample exam text proves to be more of a hindrance than a help because it leaves the reader with an inadequate amount of information to solve the sample problems and an even more inadequate reference for solutions to the problems. To date, the most effective use of this text that I have been able to devise is its use as kindling for my fireplace. The was, by far, the biggest waste of money that I have ever suffered."
1,The cover says it all....,I am not making this up. One of the features listed in bullet form on the cover is:* Written by two achomplished Professional Chemical EngineersI implore you not to buy this book.
1,My donkey could make a better airsoft gun,If you ever encounter this gun dont buy it go out to eat or save the money for something better I'm beggin you. Its not durable the scope is a plastic tube and the laser donsen't line up dont buy it
3,"Costs bearly anything, so what do you expect?","Alright, here's how it is.This is a cheaply made gun, it's not super accurate, but it doesn't cost a lot. The plastic is cheap and there's no metal. The laser is cool, but it doesn't line up. You might be thinking, ""Why'd he give it 3 stars if he hated it?"" Simple. It can be used as a shotgun. If you cock it multipe times, more bb's come out. The power lowers, but if you cock it 3 times, it's really hard to miss. The gun is also pretty powerful, and looks cool. It does NOT smell bad.If your low on cash and want a rifle, you could get this. If you're buying it because it can be used as a shotgun, just buy the shotgun pistol set."
1,bad gun,"when i got the gun i was all excited, i took it out of the box and the first thing i noticed was that it smelled like dung (seriously)...so i took it out and shot it a few times it seemed good.the next day I started shooting it again and inoticed that the range had somhow decresed to like 30 ft(no joke).Then after that the orange tip broke off(not a big problem)but than when i shot it againits range had gone down to 25ft. also the ""scope"" is just a tube with plasticcrosshairs. the gun is cheaply made and i would not buy it."
5,The Velvet Underground grows up,"The white noise that dominated the Velvet Underground's first two albums is kept to a minimum, and once again, it proves to be the low-point of the album. ""Murder Mystery"" is like ""The Gift"", a free-verse narrative set to music. Had these been proper songs, they could have turned out to be classics. But their self-titled album is by far their most song-oriented and musical effort ever. ""Pale Blue Eyes"", ""Candy Says"" and ""Some Kinda Love"" were the almost de facto rock anthems on here, and showed probably for the first time that the Velvet Underground were more than a band with only marginal musical talent that they could parlay into noise-rock. However, this seemed to signal the beginning of the end for VU as a group, for with Lou Reed and his more commercial influences dominating now, the whole notion of VU as a band was beginning to disappear."
3,velvet underground,"There are only two recordings on this album that I like. I just keep forwarding until I can hear the two I like. That's why I bought it, for the two recordings only."
5,This is THE V.U. album to own and love,"Forget ""...& Nico."" Yeah, VU's first album was retrospectively groundbreaking, but ""The Velvet Underground"" was the band at its peak. It has plenty of edge, but with plenty of pop moments, too. After ""White Light, White Heat,"" this may sound like mellowing out. It is. But it's no mellowing out at the expense of great songwriting and almost singable (!) sounds. It isn't perfect: ""The Murder Mystery"" doesn't hold up to more than one listening, and ""After Hours"" works OK as an album closer but is otherwise mostly fluff. Beyond that, there is not a weak link on the album. The lead break on ""What Goes On"" alone is enough to justify owning it."
4,Unique,"This perfume surely has a subtle and unique scent. I really love this perfume and enjoy the refreshment after pumping.. I do never intend to degrade the quality of one of my favorite perfumes by saying this, but it is somewhat comparable to the one of the air-fresher scents that was so refreshing as well.. But one thing that I like to point out is, this one has a little too heavy and dense aroma comparing to other products, so I'd rather pump it only once or twice. It maybe because this one is 'Eau de Parfum'..not 'Eau de Toilette. I highly admire the maker's talent to discover/create this special scent."
1,Michael Kors by Michael Kors,"Absolutely disgusting. I had not only myself, but four other women of varying ages but who are very tasteful try it and the responses were all the same...""Smells like an old lady""...""Smells like old Avon""...""Smells like a cheap drugstore perfume back in the 80s"". I am a big fan of most of the Michael Kors perfumes, so this was a major disappointment. It has a strong, overwhelming scent of gardenia and honeysuckle, and I know some have said that men loved it, but I just cannot see that being true. I even had a few guys in my office smell it, and THEY said it smelled like their grandmother!"
2,terrible in a good way,"the only reason this is getting 2 stars is because it really is amusing to watch, but every aspect of this movie is *bad.* From the plot to the writing to the acting, to the soundtrack. Its the second-worst movie I've ever seen next to South Beach Academy. Still, it's worth seeing once, just to laugh at it."
5,Jesse,"I got this dvd only because Jesse L. Martin was in it. I got a bit more, but this man is amazing. I don't think there is nothing he can't do......well, maybe walk a tightrope."
5,Worth the price.,"Wow. I just got this book in the mail and it's huge! Literally it looks like a phone book. It's gonna take me probably a year to read this thing, so I decided to go ahead tell people how cool this book is since there's no reviews. Click on the link at the top of the page for a picture.There's no pictures in the book (or the cover) just 700+ pages of text. Two-hundred and thirty of the top ranked noirs are reviewed in-depth down to the smallest detail then a few hundred (?) ""Significant film noirs"" are reviewed briefly. Then comes my favorite part: The Lists. Whoever this Wampa 12 is is nuts cause these lists are great! ""12 Second-Raters Who Were First-Rate"", ""Gaiety"", ""193 Best Noir Names"", ""Top 8 Wackos"", ""13 Surly Coppers"", ""5 Old Mean Nasty Females"" ""Killer Openings"" ""60 standout Scenes"", ""Top 6 Non-Humans in Noir"" and the lists go on and on."
1,Horrible ! i never for the movie !,"Horrible customer satisfaction.I never got the movie. After calling several times and so many promises. the told me the movie never shipped. It sucked , what a waste of time. Definitely not amazons best performance. I did get my money back and i left it at that. I let it go. what can i do with a gigiant."
3,"Not expected, but better than first glance","This starts out as a very sleepy agrarian tale, but quickly gets kinky when Dennis Hopper launches an affair with a 17-year-old student. He sort of ditches his long time girlfriend, the rarely seen Amy Irving, and complications ensue. There's a kind of creepy side plot involving the cancer death of Hopper's old mom. Lots of full frontal nudity, including Hopper and Irving. She, the ex- of Stephen Speillberg, is now married to the director here. I laughed as Hopper, who must be at least 67, claims to be a 47-year-old teacher here, while Irving, who must be in her late 50s, exposes herself. It turns out better than expected, despite the ominous casting of the crazy Gary Busey as the dad of the gorgeous teen bedded by Hopper. Worth watching. Did this ever play in theaters?"
5,Super.,"We ordered two of these and they work really well when it comes to preparing apples for the pies. Great quality and price...........which, of course, makes for a Great Deal !!!!"
1,The In Crowd,I would have enjoyed the music very much EXCEPT the audio quality was totally messed up. How can a product like this be released without some quality control?
1,The last straw for Verve.,"Once again, Verve has botched up what could have been a great reissue (I was particularly looking forward to this one) by deleting two bonus tracks that were on the original Chess CD. By making consumers choose between less music and lower sound quality, the record company is insulting our intelligence. I am not likely to buy anything on the Verve label group for quite some time thanks to this fiasco."
2,"clever, but...","Maher says that it's only right for people to be scrutinized at airports because they're Muslim. But Bill, how can you tell? I'm Lebanese and I'm Christian. My uncle's mother-in-law is Arab and she's Jewish. Christian Palestinians do exist. Shock and awe! You can't tell someone's religion by seeing what country they're from. And I have news that may surprise the perspicacious author - not all Muslims are misogynistic killers. Knowledge does win - and I know Bill Maher is very knowledgeable - but I don't think he should have published this book without being more informed."
1,"Maher, Maher, We All Scream For...MAHER! NOT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","This is one of the best, most comprehensive books I have ever read concerning ""low-intensity confilicts"" and the kind of engagements America finds itself in nowadays. The account is sombering. There is great characterization. There are high points (the Delta Force rescue, Army SF & SEAL actions) and there are low points (the PJ rescue & Arrowhead presence patrol). Once again the truth the America is almost too-civilized to win a fight against a foe that has a fighting spirit. I hope the author writes again!"
2,comosophy,"When a comedian becomes a philosopher you get ""comosophy."" But the pictures were enjoyable."
3,Hit&Miss,Richard Pryor is My All time Favorite Comedian Period.but Him&TV just did not fully blend.there are some cool Moments here&the Bonus Material saves the day.Marsha Warfield is cool as is Tim Reid&Sandra bernhard.Robin williams&Richard Pryor have alot of chemistry.John Witherspoon&Paul Mooney do there thing.Paula Kelly as Satan Doll was cool as well.TV ain't changed much&you can see Richard having to water certain things down.but there are some cool Performances nevertheless.
2,Mildly Entertaining but not great,"Doesn't leave a lot of room for imagination. Of course we know a lot of these characters are impossible, that's what's fun. Stick to the science and let the imaginative aspects alone.The evolution rant was tedious, unnecessary and had nothing to do with superheroes. Next time, let's hope the authors leaves their personal soapboxes at home."
3,Not exactly impressed,I understand the book was used but it was definitely not in good condition. I think this book has had a hard life! I guess all the information is the same so I am still happy with my purchase but the condition of the book was a let down...
1,DISAPPOINTING,"Before deciding to write this review, I REVIEWED other's reviews on Jackie Chan: The Prisoner. One person described this movie as a FIVE star one and kept on saying it was ""The bomb of a movie"". Well, I'm here to tell you IT IS DISAPPOINTING (I would use bigger font but can't). JACKIE CHAN ISN""T EVEN THE STAR. He's a Co-Star and had NO EFFECT on the movie. The plot......, storyline ........ Storyline was original but............. Acting was OKAY. THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE WORSE Jackie Chan movie I've ever seen or known. If you are Jackie Chan and are reading the review, I'm SORRY but it............ I would suggest Jackie Chan Fans to get the movies: Operation Condor (First one. Second Sucked),Shanghai Noon (A MUST SEE) Rush Hour (Interesting Movie) and I've heard Drunken Master 2 was good. Anywayz, I'm still a big JACKIE CHAN FAN but hey...Bad Movies exist."
2,NOT A JACKIE CHAN MOVIE,"Not a bad movie for this genre, but the title of the movie (""Jackie Chan is the Prisoner"") is a Big Fat Lie. This is not a Jackie Chan movie -- he's just one of many in the cast. Maybe it's naive to let such bold face lying (marketing) bother me, but it still does. We got the movie, actually believing that it was what Columbia/Tristar Studios promised it would be ..."
1,Boring,"Jackie Chan is not the main character, he isn't even dubbed in his own voice. Minimal fight scenes, and the fight scenes they had could've been done by any acter. This is unlike other Jackie Chan films, the fight scenes just aren't fun. I wouldn't spend my money on this, instead save your money and buy Drunken Master, or Who Am I, two other Jackie Chan dvds that are worth it."
3,Great fun!,"The title is misleading. It's 'Cool Hand Luke' meets 'Lock Up' in Hong Kong, with some slightly bizarre plot twists that leave you going ""Huh??"". I enjoyed it, though, in spite of the fact that this is NOT your typical Jackie Chan film. It's gritty, the dubbed dialogue is comprised of American slang, and there's an abundance of gratuitous profanity. Also, be warned that Chan's character is a rather minor one with not much face time and minimal fight scenes. If you aren't familiar with Chan's work, I suggest becoming acquainted with it before you see this one. Though it obviously wasn't meant to be, if viewed with a grain of salt, this film is a hoot."
5,The greatest christian music cd i have even gotten,This man is one of the greatest artists i have ever seen
3,"Kind of chezzy, but kind of enjoyable.","I'll start by saying that this is basically a knock off of the successful 80's smash ""Karate Kid"" (Pat Morita, Ralph Machio). However I found myself having a little more sympathy for the main actor (kid) in this one. Billy blanks is no Harrison Ford but, considering his backround, doesn't do all that bad. The main dissapointments(or hillariously funny aspects, depending on your perspective) were the supporting characters. The girlfriend was shallow, the antogonist kid - totally unthreatening, and the main villain-Lee so hastily put togather you'd swear only half his makeup was on. Most of the supporting characters have about the same artistic license and depth as the cast of any of Troma productions' films. Rent before you buy."
1,Don't waste your money,I bought this book based on the 5 star ratings it got. What were these people thinking? It's a very negative book. Each page shows the kid doing something else wrong. Finally he gets a star after staying after school. This is not what I want to teach my son about what kindergarten is like! My first amazon return.
3,Annoying character & creepy artwork ruined this for me,"Is it just me, or does this kid remind anyone of the inbred banjo-playing kid from the movie ""Deliverance?"" I tend to be pretty open-minded with the quality of illustrations in kids' books, but this artwork simply creeped me out from the beginning, and it all went downhill from there. It doesn't help that David is a disobedient brat a good portion of the time. All in all, I am glad that we only checked this book out from the library and didn't buy it. Unfortunately, I can't get the banjo-pickin' out of my head. Whar you goin', city boy?"
5,Best books for young children,These books by David Shannon are so funny for children. They love the things he get's into and just love reading them to my children and grandchild. Will be passed on through our family for sure.
5,Ha!,"What a great book! I bought it for my brother, also a David, who now has a three year old son. He's in for it!!Fun book!!!"
2,Nowhere near as good as the first...,"My two boys, 2 and 3 1/2, LOVE ""No! David!"". They start laughing on the first page, and are delighted all the way through. This second book just isn't funny for this age group, with the exception of just one or two pages. I think that my children, who thoroughly enjoy the naughty antics in ""No! David!"", and probably relate to them, just don't understand what David is up to in his ""big kid in school"" setting (arriving after the bell, cutting in the lunch line, having to use the rest room repeatedly, etc). If possible, borrow the book from the library and see if your child appreciates David's new situations before purchasing the book. For an older child, it may be one to read over and over."
4,"Great Quality, but too big","Ordered this to place in a cabinet and secure my 32"" LCD onto. Unfortunately, I measured wrong and the swivel was a couple inches too big for the cabinet. Returned the product to the vendor with no issues and received my refund.Otherwise, the swivel was very heavy duty and well made. If it fits where you need it, I would recommend it based on the quality observed uninstalled."
3,"An ok book, but one thing....","This book was very exciting and what was good, I enjoyed.However, there was one thing that I really didn't appreciate.The use of four-letter words is very abundant in this book. Aside from the fact that I hate that anyway, it's not very accurate. To use words like that in those days, even in a journal, meant a severe punishment if you were caught! I don't think that an author would dare take the risk.This is supposed to be a kid's book, but I guess its gotten so course nowadays that bad language can even be used there and not be taken offensively.Parents beware, if you have a no-tolerance policy on language, you might want to read this first before giving it to your children!"
4,Really wonderful,"Starting from track one, the title track, the CD starts out strong. The next track, ""Ice Queen"" also has a nice sound. When it gets to ""Our Farewell"", it gets softer and slower, but prettier too. ""Caged"" isn't one I remember too fully. ""The Promise"" starts out soft, but gets louder and stronger as it goes on. ""Never-ending story"" has its moments of triumph. ""Deceiver of Fools"" is wicked awesome (my favorite track on the CD). ""Intro"" scares me. ""Dark Wings"" is very cool to listen to. ""In Perfect Harmony"" is in a way contrasting to everything else because its very light and not at all metallish like so many of the other songs. The bonus tracks are ok. My favorite is ""Restless"" with awesome piano. The last three aren't really worth listening to in my opinion, but overall, I simply love the majority of this CD. From the start, it starts off strong and bulids, then dies, but it's still a favorite."
2,Not too tempting to play again,"The only reason I got this album is because that beautiful song, ""Bittersweet"" isn't available anywhere but on this import. The rest of the songs are a screechfest of constant high-pitched singing, and after 4 songs of the same, my nerves started to fray. Some of the other stuff is too Goth to be likable for my tastes.To be fair, ""The Heart of Everything,"" their other album, is superior to this one. I enjoy hearing that one often.All in all, I instantly imagined Within Temptation to be the perfect music vehicle for any of Stephanie Meyer's vampire romances."
2,Very Disappointing...,"I purchased this CD only being familiar with the third track, Farewell. Sharon does a fantastic job on that song, but otherwise, her voice is just outright annoying! I listened to the CD three times thinking I wasn't giving Within Temptation a fair shake, but I couldn't make myself like it! There are two major elements that turned me against this band. First, Sharon tends to sound a great deal like Alanis Morrisett, very annoying for me! Secondly, the music just sounds watered down, again, very annoying! If you want a great female led band, then give Nightwish a shot. Purchase Nightwish's Century Child, and you won't be disappointed! Nightwish's female vocalist, Tarja, has a beautiful voice, with a very powerful band backing her up!"
5,Yet another Oxo winner.,"Cheap too. Works great. Will take the place of many microplane jobs for me. That super sharp microplane still scares me after all these yrs! The Oxo's handle just might be too big. Easy to clean. All my Oxo purchases (except the pepper grinder, a total waste of money that one!) have been winners and worth it at twice the price."
3,Backpack Not As Pictured,"The backpack in the photo is different than the one I received. I ordered the red/black Jansport Wasabi. The picture shows a bright vivid red. It's not. More of a brownish red, rust color. And instead of a solid black front, the zipper under the Jansport logo is colored with the brownish red. Not a big deal but the bright red is what I liked about it. I wish you could put correct photos on the site. Returning stuff is a pain."
2,Where's the Battle?,"Barely 30 minutes long and surprisely tame, a major disappointment. This does NOT have Krupa's big band, just a trio. If you haven't bought the studio Krupa/Rich album (70 minutes long), buy that. If you have that album and are looking for more, this ain't it!"
2,An amazing hoot; one of a kind.,"You gotta be sitting down for this hysterical disaster. Camp entertainment value is a solid 5 stars but as a serious work, it doesn't even register a twinkle. Pascucci's vocal histrionics rival those of Patty Duke's as Neely. Best cut: ""I'll Plant My Own Tree"" done to a disco beat. Really."
4,"Hugh Grant at his awkward, stuttering best...","It was refreshing to see Hugh Grant in a role where the same formula as ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" and ""Notting Hill"" were not used: his character falls for a woman, she 'ruthlessly' sleeps with him and leaves him, only to come back in time for a happy ending. Jane Tripplehorn and Hugh make a great onscreen match, and I was laughing (sometimes nervously) the whole time--particularly during the suspensfully funny gangster scenes. Worth seeing more than once!"
2,Rent it when you have nothing else to do,"""Mickie Blue Eyes"" is a mob-style comedy that doesn't do a very good job of covering either the mob or the comdey part of its genre. I personally enjoy James Caan and got this movie just because of him and the preview. This is not one of James Caan's better movies and the preview apparently had all the funny material from the movie within it (once you've seen the preview you have pretty much seen the only parts of the movie that were any good)."
4,Hugh Grants Bumbling Brit Routine gets Another Showing.,"""Mickey Blue Eyes"" lies a little below ""Analyse This"", alongside ""The Whole Nine Yard's"", and Well Above ""Mafia"". It is a Constantly Enjoyable Comedy even though most of the great laughs are given away in the trailer.Hugh's performance may have been Over-Shadowed by ""Notting Hill"" one, but here he is allowed to Cut Loose and be Funnier, Sillier and play to his Stereotype, as does James Caan, playing a comical version of himself. Jeanne Tripplehorn gets to play a rare nice role and seems to have fun. In fact, everyone in the film seems to be having fun and that adds to the audiences fun.The DVD isn't exactly packed with features so it looses 1 star for that, but fans of the film will not be disappointed."
3,"Great for Programmers, not for Beginners","After reading some of the customer reviews, I was convinced that this was ""The Book"" to learn C. Lucky for me, I have some programming backround, so I was able to muddle through much of the thick programming jargon. But this book is not for beginners, the jargon alone will frustrate and put-off the first time programmer, and hinder their learning. On another note, this book doesn't deal well with large file I/O, which is really what I needed it for."
2,A little simple if you know ANY C.,"I've always been told just to use K&R to learn C. I thought I needed another book to help out. Unfortunately, this book was a bit too simplistic and did very little to clarify points in K&R that were difficult. If you can program at all, this isn't the book for you."
2,Unoriginal,"Rather lame. Not much to write about or listen to. Even the name wasn't original, taken from the English 60's Rock group - better to listen to 'Watercolour Days' or 'Up Above our Heads' by the original 'Clouds'."
3,Expectations of something more,"One expects the typical Hollywild flesh in B movies of this type, but I also expect a movie with Edward Albert in it to exude the charisma which his characters usually project in carrying a movie.With that I was disappointed in he played a droll person locked in a book. Diana Barton looked in the entire movie like a sparkling bubble just waiting to extoll the champaign of her talent, but was never uncorked.The director who wrote this appears to have lifted the story from cheap online erotica, but failed time and again to deliver as scenes jumped from one sexcapade to the other. He forgot the tease.Patrick Swayze was wasted in a bit part and all I could think was in watching Chad McQueen was how he was nothing like another McQueen, Steve.This movie could have been a spectacular erotic thriller, but the characters never had the opportunity to develope, which is the directors fault.3 stars because Diana Barton is more beautiful clothed than undressed."
2,Disappointing :(,"Now, I love Anne, I really do. I've read the first five books many times. But this one falls quite flat. LMM spends about a page every chapter describing the flowers and the trees and whatnot, which gets old fast. Additionally, I feel like I as a reader got demoted. While Anne and Gilbert have their lives, the reader gets relegated to the kiddie table to see what hi-jinx the children are up to. I'm sure the children are great, but I've followed Anne from eleven years old, and I want to stay with her. I felt condescended to.The quilting chapter bored me utterly to death. The other characters that were introduced came and went too quickly...except for Aunt Mary Maria, I felt cheated out of getting to know anyone. The whole book is too much telling, not enough showing. Overall..it was just a struggle to get through, which I only managed because I think it's a shame not to read the whole series."
3,The beginning of the end,"in this book Anne stops being Anne! She becomes this average mother that sits in the background. Gilbert is hard to find and is never called Gilbert, but only Dr. Blythe. I don't mind the children but the Anne story should have ended at book five. The end, where Anne feels jealous was about the only part you could truly enjoy, it had the only bit of romance you see in the whole book. Read it if you love Anne but if you don't, don't bother."
5,Excellent!,This is one of my favorite books by Lucy Maud Montgomery (or any author for that matter) and I've read most of her works. Each chapter reads like an individual short story and the tales are beautiful and funny. A must-read for any Montgomery fan
4,Good!,"Not the best Anne book, but good! :-) It's 'good' to see some conflict in Anne and Gilbert's marriage instead of the sweet but forced bliss in ANNE OF WINDY POPLARS and ANNE'S HOUSE OF DREAMS."
4,BILLIE AT THE END,"Not the record to buy if you want to get acquinted withher ,since BILLIE at the time of this recording was not what she had been.It just as though she was having a hangover a minute.True fans may want to hear it however and have it in their collection.It is really quite simply the falling of a lost soul.Classic songs here receive a strange and all together self satisfied approach, even though the session men tried hard and are not to blame.To be honest, it is really a mixed bag.I DIDN'T KNOW IT TIME IT WAS seems almost unrecognizable if you compare it with ELLA'S 1956 recording."
5,A Fantastic Fun Movie,I absolutely love this movie. It is heartwarming! Shirleys talent shines in this movie.
5,Pitt makes me really miss Levitt,"Chances are anyone who rates this book as a 1 is a broker, member of AICPA, or serves on the Senate Banking committee. I am an investor who is very concerned about the greedily protected lack of transparency in the way public companies report their earnings or lack thereof, so I am giving this excellent book a 5.The book is useful because it describes how securities markets really work. It also functions as practical investment advice which details what is happening with your money after it leaves your hands. It should be required reading in MBA programs. Finally, voters will be much more informed about how Congress, through its protection of accountants, investment bankers, and brokers, is interfering with the efficient allocation of capital in the US economy."
5,the face in the misty lights,"Another great classic film from writer Vera Caspary (see also Letter to three Wives). Laura is a taut noir mystery which includes an intriguing story with twists, unique characters, impeccable direction and acting by all and the memorable title song heard frequently through the years written by David Raksin. The beautiful detail in the set design and wardrobe are exquisitely captured. This is a visual delight with enough complexity that can bear repeated viewing. A&E Biography features on Gene Tierney and Vincent Price provide interesting insight into these two actors. Fortunately there are two different audio commentary tracks to choose from. I much preferred Rudy Behlmer's commentary for the many stories he provided surrounding the making of this movie - truly indispensible for afictionados."
5,One of the Best of the Golden Age,"We make a habit of watching movies from the 1940's. Some were awful, some were ok, some were great and others truly earn the title of a classic. Laura falls into the category of a true classic. With great acting, meaningful plot, attractive stars, great dialogue and superb timing, Laura earns a place on the ""must see"" list of this era's movies."
4,One of my favorites!,I've always loved this movie and it was a real treat to be able to get it on DVD given it's age. The picture quality was great and it even included a scene that was cut from the original release and I don't believe has been included in the television runs.
3,Not as good as it sounds.,"I had seen Gene Tierney in ""Leave Her to heaven"" and i was impressed by her looks and her acting,i love that movie. And i had seen reviews on this film,and how it was soo good and everything,well i had meant to see a while ago,but never did. When i first watched it,i will say i did enjoy it but,its not as good as people make it out to be at all,first laura is supposed to be bdead,and when dana andrews ins in her apartment and she comes back,you cant really tell if hes dreaming,or if its a flashbvack,or if its real,so that was a bit confusing. Overall,an ok film,the cinematography is good,and the cast is very good."
2,Seriously overrated,"Another classic movie that isn't. The acting isn't all that great, especially Vincent Price miscast and unconvincing as the movie's dandy; I didn't believe for a moment that a real Laura would have ever had any interest in him. And the moment we learn that Laura falls for the cop, Dana Andrew's Lt. McPherson, is a true groaner. Even Gene Tierney doesn't really impress. Yes, she's beautiful. But she is also stuck in a movie with two love interests that don't work; there are _no_ memorable scenes in this movie involving her. Last, but definitely not least, the murder mystery is at most mediocre.So what generates the high interest and ratings for this movie? One has to suppose it is a period piece, one that really worked in its day. Tierney wears one dress that must have been a serious wow'er back in the 40s. And perhaps the music is as good as some reviewers suggest. In sum, even so, count this one as seriously overrated."
3,Short but sweet,"Written by Robert Herrick (the American novelist, not the British poet), this book describes a retreat to which men visit to recover from the harshness of life. The 'innkeeper' is known as the Master. One sceptical visitor arrives at the inn with ideas that soon change the harmony of the atmosphere at this inn...Reading this book makes one wish that retreats such as this one existed in modern-day life. When I purchased this book I had little clue as to the synopsis however I was pleasantly surprised with this little gem. This is the second book by Herrick I've read and it has inspired me to read more of his novels. His ideas are quite original and he writes in a quirky manner, with some pages of much description here and there, as one finds in a classic novel. A good read!"
5,Do not pass this one by.,"The premise, the music, the performances! This movie is a gem. I have been a ""movie buff"" since the days of the Saturday double feature with an eleven cent admission charge. I know not how many movies I have seen but I do know this is one of the finest. How wonderful motion pictures such as this can be so ""hidden"" is beyond me. I urge you to purchase this one for your library. You will not be sorry. I will say, if you are a Vin Diesel fan, this picture is not for you. This movie has a soul and charm."
4,Pizza cutter,"I am a big fan of OXO products, this was given as a gift and I already own a similar one and love mine."
2,Rather disappointing,"I was very disappointed in this book. I found it to be too much touchy feely and fluffy, and too little substance. Other than trying to compare setting up a CMM program to choreographing a ballet (which didn't do it for me), I found nothing insightful about this book. I have a large CMM library that I frequently reference, but this is one book definitely collecting dust. I would recommend not wasting your money as there are far better books on the market that address the subject in far greater depth and breadth."
3,what you see is what you get....,"Part of a series detailing SEAL exploits in various wars. This one covers Panama and the first Gulf war and blends characterisation, history and SEAL lore and mantra. This is the sort of book that does exactly what it says on the cover, you know it will be a little right wing, you know it will be a love letter to the SEALs, you know there will be Special Forces action. And, given all that it does deliver as promised. Some repetition (the author does love telling us water temperatures and repeating some tales) but the historical element is well positioned and this raises it above the traditional special forces pulp fiction. What you see is what you get."
1,A perfect example of how Bush's White House is for sale to the highest bidder,Can you imagine the uproar if Clinton had done something like this?
4,Looks and works great.,This hose looks great and is working fine. Too bad that it's tucked under the gas tank of my bike because it would have some very nice bling factor!
5,Incredible Movie!,"I was already a racing fan, but seeing this movie really was incredible, from both a racing standpoint, and an acting standpoint. The story was a little flat, but the special effects more than made up for it. Gina Gershon is an INCREDIBLE actress, and plays the role of Cathy very VERY well... And with the DVD, you get to see a little more of the actress thanks to the added scenes. Only on DVD ^_^"
3,Fine peice of advertising,"If you want to see adds for companies and products splashed all over the screen you have the right movie. With all the free or not free advertising in this movie it makes me think that Hollywood is going broke.It does have some incredible but barely believable crashes. Unfortunately the rest of the movie is the typical race fan movie. If you need something to watch because your cable is out and you have not seen this go ahead and rent it, I would not buy it because you will only watch it once."
1,I watched this on a recommendation ......,"Somebody recommended this wonderful piece of tripe to me as a good movie, and now I wish them bodily harm. The special effects were pretty good, but they don't save the outrageousness of the acts being commited in the movie. Add that to the lousy acting by just about everbody in the film, and you have a bonified loser of a movie. I wish I could give this movie negative stars.After watching this wonderful piece of garbage DVD, I watched the deleted scenes. It then made perfect sense to me why Stabone was in charge of the screenplay. He deleted any scene dipicting him as he was originally written, as a bad person. Stabone always has to play the hero. What an ego, somebody should call him and let him know that he's no longer ""cool"". Oh wait, was he ever?"
3,Could have been better if:,"I read the reviews on this and watched the clip on moviefon.com and decided to purchase it. I am a fan of Stallone's other movies and this looked good. It was, but you could not really hear the dialog for the music. The music was so overpowering that you couldn't hardly hear what they were saying at times. Other than that the movie was pretty good."
2,"""Rocky"" On Wheels","""Driven"" may be the only racing flick in which no one gets killed - just as it would happen in real life. Still, this second Sylvester Stallone-Renny Harlin collaboration is fairly enjoyable on a junk-food-cinema level. The racing sequences are exciting (despite some obvious digital effects) and, surprisingly, Stallone's character takes a back seat to the young leads. However, one wishes Stallone had written a screenplay that wasn't a ""Rocky"" retread - right down to casting Burt Reynolds in the Burgess Meredith role. As a result, ""Driven"" covers the same narrative ground that you've seen in previous Stallone efforts. Though not a bad film, it's easy to understand why ""Driven"" crashed and burned with movie audiences."
1,Drivel,"I am a big F1 fan and when I heard Stallone was going to make an F1 I was intrigued. When he decided not to make it because of the limited access he would have to the teams I was disappointed. However, after seeing the movie I was glad F1 decided not to get involved.The race scenes was like watching a video game on a big screen TV. Every accident was over the top. Even funnier were the inconsistencies regarding the cars. You need a special starter to get the hydraulics started and then you can start the engine. However, in ""Chicago"" both Kip & Sly were able to start the cars without them when they went racing through the streets. The plot was not much better and the characters one-demensional.This movie is good for unintentional laughs, just like any movie where Keanu Reeves is trying to play a serious character."
3,stallone takes the time to mentor a young race car driver,good fun action packed movie about indy cars. stallone shines as the older veteran driver brought in by burt reynolds to help teach a young up and comer to settle down a bit and just win races. good light hearted movie with a good ending and some twists and turns.
3,Hokey but great action,Rocky meets Indy Cars. Stallone mumbles alot. The movie is predictible and the chase scene thru the streets is next to impossible unless in a CGI world. The action is good and it is fun to see a modern movie with champ cars in it. It is watchable especially if you are an Indy car fan. You should be willing to throw salt over your shoulder along with your realism button and just watch it to see the cars and action.
1,"Beware, This Product Will Mess Up Your Computer Big Time!","For some reason every time a new version of Norton comes out, I try it... not any more! I installed Norton to protect my computer and almost immediately I started to notice problems with it. It slowed down my computer to a crawl and made it perform as if it was infected by the worst spyware program in existence. But worst of all, my spyware free computer got infected by every spyware you can imagine while I was downloading updates from Norton. And to top it off Norton could not fix the problem. It took me three other anti-spyware programs to fully undo what Norton did to my computer. Avoid Norton at all costs, if you don't heed my advice you will regret it. Look for other programs such as McAfee AntiSpyWare 2005. [...]"
1,Gar Bage,"This is the worst ice cream scoop ever. The part of the scoop that attaches to the handle is only about 1/4 inch in diameter. It's a total scam; they made it look thicker, by making the part that holds the scoop 4 times as wide. You can't tell by looking at it, because they have cleverly disguised it with the plastic handle. I found out when the handle broke off in my hand, while trying to scoop some hard ice cream. Oxo, you should be ashamed of yourselves for making this piece of junk, which was clearly designed to deceive the consumer. I'll likely never buy an Oxo product again."
3,Look elsewhere,"Mechanically it works, the corners cut into the ice cream nicely, but the chrome starts to come off way too soon. Now I have divots in my ice cream scoop."
1,Projectile Vomiting,"I rented this movie because the synopsis honestly sounded entertaining. I wish I could have actually watched the movie; however, 10 minutes in not one shot had held still. First, a scene where it visibly cuts and jumps every 3 seconds, then an entire scene filmed circling the characters who are speaking, then a scene that moves between someone pacing and zooming and panning of a crowd. I was nauseous and had completely forgotten the meaning of the word 'stationary'. If you value your equilibrium, try a different movie by someone who can set up a tripod."
3,Spend more and get quality,"What can I say- it fogs up within a minute.Not a great product, you get what you pay for and this is a classic example."
2,"Not worth the money, the mirror fogged right up and the mirror",Not worth the money the mirror fogged right up and the mirror has a distorted appearance to it. I would not buy this ahain
4,Shower Mirror,The Magnification was the selling point for me and it works as advertised but like most mirrors it still fogs during your shower. Overall though I'm happy with the purchase.
5,Jaws on blue ray,My son is a movie collector and really wanted this film on blue ray.It is a welcome addition to his collection.
3,"No-one's twisting your arm, you know...","Everyone's so disgruntled at the release of a 30th anniversary edition of one of the greatest adventure films ever made. But why? So many people who visit Amazon are, like me, collectors but at times a little restraint is all you need to not buy into the ""yet-another-special-edition"" trap. Do what I do. Ask yourself..do I NEED it or do I WANT it?"
4,comment on Jaws,"THIS IS A WELL KNOWN, GOOD BUT DISTURBING MOVIE ABOUT A GREAT WHITE SHARK. i know someone who will not swim in the ocean after seeing it."
3,Not as good as Jaws 2.,"It is not as horrifying,awesome or cooler than it's next two sequels,Jaws 2 and Jaws 3.You barely even see a shark until WAYYYYYYYYY later in the movie."
1,Wrong Impression,"When the uncut version was shown on television a few months ago,they advertised the video would be the same as the uncut version shown on television. I played the first video and it is the same as the original movie without the uncut scenes. This is truly one of my favorite movies and when I saw it on television with the never before scenes, I couldnt wait to get that version on video. If I had known this, I wouldnt have bought the Anniversary Edition."
5,We're gonna need a bigger boat,"""Jaws"" is my all time favorite movie. it's that simple. I have seen it so many times - I can't even count. I have the VHS Special Edition & have been waiting for it to be released on DVD for quite awhile now. Speilberg's summer thriller of 1975 is still the best shark movie of all time. It will have you on the edge of your seat until the very end. If by some freak chance - you haven't seen this movie yet. Get it. Watch it. Love it!"
3,O.K. Movie,This movie is definetley not one of the best movies I have ever saw but it can stand it. I mean at least it is better than Open Water. I don't know why the critics liked this movie so much it is good but not irresistable you can hardly see the shark in the first 30 minutes of the movie. I just bought it because I thought I had to have it but you really don't so my advice is rent and do not buy it. My grade over all (C+)Jaws is rated PG For intense shark action and some language.*Jaws may be to INTENSE for younger children.
5,the best shark movie,Jaws is a great horror movie because its true that sharks eat people.Its a movie that keeps me out of the water.know other shark movie comes close to this one trust me.Its about a sheriff who must stop a great white shark from eating all the swimmers in town.This movie is a great buy!
1,Yuck,"Besides being absolutely disgusting,this IS the worst movie ever made.Jaws 2 was WAY better.Check out Jaws 4 too."
5,"C'mon, IT'S JAWS","Not going to review the movie, everyone knows it is perfect.The picture is phenomenal, crisp, clear and flawless. The special features are great, especially about the restoration.A must have for a blu-ray collection."
4,Pretty Good,"There are plenty of reviews of this one so I'll hit on some specific points:1. I think that the casting was a little lame -- the people in the roles are pretty much ""as expected"" and I thought that took away from the movie. I didn't see any newer actors ""develop a future"" thru this horror vehicle.2. It's a good story, a great white shark plagueing a resort town, and the subsequent political and other conflicts between the mayor, the police chief, the marine biologist and, the shark hunter.3. The suspense was really great -- few movies, short of ""The Birds"" achieve this level of keeping you on the edge of your seat. The creepy soundtrack probably accounted for 50% of this actuality.This movie isn't for everyone but I'd watch it again."
2,Angry me,"It took forever for it to arrive and, when it did, the plastic wrapping was torn and a section ripped off. Also the DVD was rattling around inside for the push button that holds the disk in place was broken and rattling around in it. Lucky that the DVD wasn't ruined. Movie is good, which is why I ordered it, but the service and state was bad."
5,Exquisitely Written,"What the other reviews fail to convey about this wonderful book is that the writing is exquisite. Each chapter uses real-life examples, ironies and juxtapositions to vividly evoke contrasts between America and Europe and demonstrate the course of change. When the chapters arc to their conclusion, you feel a real emotional and intellectual punch. History writing just doesn't get any better than this."
5,A great book,"After having read ""My Antonia"", I wanted to read more Cather, so I read this book. I was not disappointed. The writing is beautiful and the characters memorable. Alexandra is a great yet flawed protagonist and her struggles throughout her life reflect the universal struggles that occupy us all. Some reviewer called this book ""dated"" and I strongly disagree. There is something here for all human beings living in 2004."
1,A MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT,"Hoping to expand my experience with oriental fiction in a story by a Japanese writer I ordered this impressively recommended novel. It was more than novel. It was wierd, with a story line that wasn't believable even pushing the limits in accepting the supernatural. The amateurish development of the ""monster"" character coupled with detailed episodes of grisley gore and violence might attract Japanese Godzilla fantasy fans. Not me. It didn't end. It just stopped, which turned out to be one of the better elements of the book."
2,Don't buy the hype,"A pretentious and self-important exercise. Far too cute for it's own good and a meditation that keeps pounding the head of the reader... ok already; we get it!Not half as good as it thinks it is and despite some sizzling reviews from the UK, it's made for angst ridden teens and kids with a gothic sense of the world."
5,Romance entwines with an investigation,Danvers departs from his virtual reality Bin world to provide a political thriller set in South America and revolving around a plot to send Latinos to Mars. Romance entwines with an investigation of the plot which exposes many to danger and reveals the use of subliminal manipulation unprecedented in human activity. The focus on politics and social issues of Third World countries is realistic and involving.
3,"What happened to the Third world? Second,.. First... ?",The twists and surprises of this grosspageturner allow us to sleep deeper anddeeper into some of the most horrificnightmares of our lives--while perspiring lots ofsweat.
1,Total Disappointment!,"I don't care how much ""Fun"" and ""Realistic"" is the pitch from the marketing. This game is BAD! Pretty cars in the select menu, that's it for the cool graphics! In game visuals are lame! The Replay mode is just.. well I have not seen such a low quality since my Dreamcast!And the controls and ""realistic"" driving? Where? I'm a race game junkie, so my skill is pretty decent. I can hardly believe that a race car needs 10 second to get to 30mph and fly out of control on slightest turns. Yes visually it feels you are still at 5mph. I returned the game after first 30 minutes of play.Rally Sport Challenge 2 is 1000 times better! Collin McRae's game.... is just wrong..."
1,Buyer Beware!,"I had purchased this product thinking it would be the same as the title suggested. Instead I just got a unheard of CD titled Moonlight Piano (Hold the Readers Digest part). In addition, I soon discovered that the seller had only sent me one of the 2 CDs and I still don't know whether I would receive the second one. Do your homework carefully and buyer beware! there are so many pitfalls out there...so good luck!PJ"
3,Some More Footage,"I agree that including only these two videos was kind of disappointing for $.... The least that RCA could have done was include the ""Before Your Love"" Making the Video that aired shortly after Kelly won AI. Or even some behind-the-scenes footage of AI would have been nice. But this is a good companion to go with the audio single if you own it. The videos are nice and simple and focus on Kelly's singing, not her body, backup dancers, or fancy special video effects. I mostly bought it because MTV didn't show either of these videos as much as they did other videos by more established artists."
1,Kelly Clarkson - Before Your Love/A Moment Like This,I never rec'd this. So I will have to give it a bad review.
5,wow,"this dvd is just so great, the sound is great, kelly is beautiful, better to see her sing on the dvd, i got the cd but this is much better. they don't , show the whole thing on both song on mtv or trl it's great"
4,Finally some growth!!,I received this plant as a Christmas gift last December. It was in fairly good shape despite being packed only in a box with some packing materiel and left for several hours on my mom's doorstep in the middle of the cold Nebraska winter. I repotted the plant and it didn't to anything until about 3 weeks ago. I had put in a fertilizer spike about a month ago hoping to coax it into action. I am not sure if it was the fertilizer or a good dose of sun but it has been rapidly growing for several weeks now and looks beautiful. I can't wait to see if it will flower!!
3,OXO Good Grips Lever Ice Cream Scoop,"This ice cream scoop only works well for really hard ice cream. If the ice cream is even a little soft, it sticks and won't come all the way out."
4,Good stuff,"To that Mike guy and his one star rating: what? Did you even finish the book? The ending is quite interesting, to say the least.While i do agree Stackpole's style can be somewhat dry at times, he does slowly input detail that brings the world, and most importantly the plot to life. There are a good handful of suprises in the book to keep it lively.His battle descriptions are very interesting from a military standpoint but lack much of the emotion that would draw me deeper into them. Stackpole presents the battle tactics in a clean, logical way that makes it easy to draw parrallels to modern warfare.For the most part it is a step above the usual fantasy series released these days and a worthy read. Definitely better than Fortress, and almost as good as Dark Glory War."
5,When Dragons rage,"The DragonCrown War Cycle series is absolutely one of the best series I have everread. The characters are so filled out and vividly drawn that I was mourning thefact that I did not have another wonderful series to follow this one. If you getthe chance, reward yourself, settle back and enjoy, enjoy, enjoy!"
3,Original album has unfortunate addition,"The original vinyl got a lot of play, got the CD reissue much later, which had finally developed some unplayable spots. Ordered what was thought to be exact re-issue.In the ""why can't Polydor leave well-enough alone"" department, original 10 cut album has had 2 additions tacked on, one from another album that ""fits"" in both atmosphere and sonics, and another which is jarringly out of place [a brass-based Christmas polka-esque cut] in both atmosphere and volume/compression level that I frankly despise. Was going to downgrade rating 3 or 4 stars.But, to be fair, a plus is that original recording tapes have been revisited, and a side-by-side comparison shows improved sound. Downgraded only two stars for that reason.And I'll burn a separate ""clean"" CD version [minus cut 11 - shudder] for my use and put original away."
5,Fantastic,"Excellent book for the first time buyer, a lot of information definitely need to read it twice..."
4,Very Good!,"This book was very informative, gives great details on investing in multi-family housing, I highly recommend it! I also recommend, ""How to Make Fast Cash in Real Estate with No Money Down Deals,"" by: Rod L. Griffin"
3,"Basic real estate investing book, nothing special","This is a beginner book on real estate investing, it covers all the essentials, but in a very boring school textbook style. It is so generic and so ultimately forgettable, there is not one piece of information that isn't covered in any other REI book with better insights and more detail."
2,battery life not good,I bought a replacement battery for my phone here for $10 (instead of from nokia for $50). The one i received had scuff marks like it had been used and it's life is hardly better than the one i was replacing with it. I have to be sure to charge it every two days or it will suddenly be dead. lame.
1,Bad News,"I received this battery in good time with prompt shipping. Unfortunately, it was worse than the battery I was replacing. I got approximately 4 to 6 hours of life on standby primarily! I asked if this was refurbished or with an old manufacture date and was told it was new with a 2009 manufacture date.The company was responsive and professional and promptly sent me another battery. The replacement was just as bad as the first. I received a refund without a problem. I ordered this battery through another company as well and received another piece of junk too!Unfortunately, I have to use another phone since I can't find a good battery. Anybody have any ideas (other than a $50 battery)?"
5,Nokia battery,"I found this item a OEM battery for a very competitive price, ordered it and received it very quickly. I shop a lot on Amazon and have always felt they carry the best products with the fastest delivery and the most accommodating policies and customer service."
2,Very disappointing product.,"I thought buying OEM would be better than one of the clones. This battery isn't any better than the original battery that came with my phone 2 years ago. I don't use my phone much, but I'm having to recharge this battery every other day. I didn't make a good choice on this one."
3,Not bad,"It does not work the same as the battery that comes with your phone at new... however, it brought to life my old phone"
1,dissatisfied,I have loved every Oxo item which I have purchased. I found this jar opener very difficult to handle. It would not clasp the lid well. I was never successful using it. My husband did not like it either. Trashed it.
2,take it for what it is,"this is just a compilation album put together by fc kahuna. kinda sorta alright if you like this kind of music and are interested in hearing their influences/peers. personally, i don't usually like this kind of music and fc kahuna is just an exception, so, this is album is pretty, you know, meh..."
5,awesome,Love our old 80's classic scarry movies. My daughter loves them too. She now has the whole collection. Just awesome
1,Why even bother?,"Hey what is up with this movie? I mean what is the point? The original Jaws was (a good word for it is ""polutted"")because this movie sucked so much that is wasn't funny. Even though Jaws II sucked as well it was better than this crap-fest filled with bad acting, bad effects, and an ending that just plain ruined the movie. I think this movie should be renamed to "" The Day the Movie industry Sunk to a New Low"". Thank you for your time end don't buy Jaws III"
2,"Good effects, but the rest is a silly bore.","Great white shark gets loose in Seaworld and some mayhem ensues. The third film in the Jaws series features the best-looking shark to date, but the editing is often atrocious, the shark moves slower than molasses, and there's a reason why Bess Armstrong isn't a well-known actress. One of Dennis Quaid's first movies, and he's not bad here."
3,Bad in Theatres - Not Too Bad on VHS,"I saw this in the theatre. The 3-D was not effective or very good. In fact, the 3-D was so bad I found it difficult to watch. On tape the film is not really that bad. It was to its credit that they did not follow JAWS (I) and JAWS II and they did try to come up with an original story. Dennis Quaid never gives a bad performance and he really helps this movie out. It's not a great film but it is enjoyable."
3,Jaws 3 is OK,"Sure the 3-D effects look incredibly cheesy not in 3-D, but the story line isn't all that bad, even if it doen't tie too well to the first two movies. Dennis Quaid and Bess Armstrong turn in some ok performances. Lou Gossett, Jr.'s performance is not very strong however (didn't he win an Oscar the same year?) The plot has some holes in it, but there are a few decent jolts in it. Far superior to the awful 4th but not as good as Jaws and Jaws 2."
3,Jaws 3 is not that bad!,"It kicked ass in 3D, and anyone who would think that the later installment Jaws The Revenge is better, is obviously a moron of epic proportions."
3,Watchable Time Spender,"Jaws 3 continues the Brody adventures with Great White Sharks. Years since Martin Brody killed ANOTHER shark in Amity, his grown sons face the same challenges in Seaworld, Florida although they don't realize that a Full-grown Great White is prowling until the climax of the film. Good music and scares but rather lazy acting hurt although its still quite enjoyable and Louis Gotsette Jr. is quite unintentionally funny!"
1,They should've stopped after Jaws 2,Just awful. One of the worst movies I've ever seen. Trying to make more money on a name (Jaws) is shameful.
1,would give it 0 stars if I could,"This movie is, well, just about every bad thing I can possibly say about a movie. Let's just say it's cheesy in every way. The acting, the gore, the plot, everything. It's just pure cheese. I don't see how anyone could possibly like this movie. It's so stupid! I wouldn't even say it's one of those ""so bad it's good"" movies. It's not enjoyable in any way whatsoever."
3,Jaws 3D,would be nice if when buying a 3D movie it is supplied with 3D glasses for viewing. Kind of lost the effect without them
3,Almost too far,"Ok, ok. There are a handful of films whose sequals are better than the original. Unfortunately, Jaws III isn't one of them. The original Jaws is the best (a classic!), the second wasn't so bad, and this one is ok. (The fourth reeks terribly...) But this one did leave me wondering...that's it? It's kinda lacking in substance (hence the PG rating), but all in all, it's on ok movie."
2,C'monnnn,I loveeee the Jaws movies but this one was terrible. It just didn't fit in with the rest of them. Kind of like how Halloween 3 doesn't fit in with the rest of the Halloweens.
5,lives up to the last 2 and even shocks more,glad I saw this on tv many timesthe creepiest scene to meis when the shark is coming at them really slowly as they're inside that holding thing and you hear the slow creepy musicand then BAM! the glass shatters and they're all underneath the watertruly horrifyingI am so getting this on dvdwhen I canit's another classic to the jaws seriesit never let me downit shocked the hell out of me if anythingit made me laugh too cuz there is some humor in these jaws movies and I like that
2,Too stiff,"This brush is too stiff for general dish or glass cleaning. It's probably better at scrubbing. Holds very little soapy water in it's bristles, this can be an issue if your not cleaning something already immersed in soapy water. The bristles at the end of the brush don't stick out enough to clean in front of the brush, e.g. trying to clean the bottom of a blender. Very limited usefulness for me."
3,Decent kitchen brush,"I bought this based on the rave reviews I found here on Amazon. I was looking for something rugged enough to clean my extensive cast iron collection that would hold up to dish washer cleaning. This does an OK job, but for real tough cleanup on my griddle I still fall back to steel wool."
2,bristles too soft,The bristles are too soft and splay quite easily. After a few weeks use we threw it away and purchased a different brand.
4,"Arnold vs Satan...Apocalypse Later On, Maybe..","...it turns out being great fun to look at, and it's a good action-thriller, but it's nowheres as good as his two Terminator films. Score one for Arnold for having a decent film to end his 90's career. Arnold's not a dramatic actor, but he sure has many a funny line in here...also, I kept waiting for the Stay Puff Marshmellow Man or Slimer to start creeping in the New York streets-- who says the end of the world has to start in NYC? I know of plenty of places that should be considered alternatives...Look for similarites between this and two other Gabriel Byrne films ""Stigmata"" and ""The Usual Suspects""...Recent films to look for Satan in are ""Needful Things"" (surprisingly good) and Pacino in overdrive in ""The Devil's Advocate""..."
4,Give Arnie A Break,"Irrespective of where you are, I have the funny feeling that this film is made fun of or ridiculed by the general public & the critics. One thing about critics is they are paid to criticise movies. For that simple reason, I watched the movie anyway. Arnie just got better with age. Even though there's still an element of accent in his command of English, his acting ability is improving comparing with his Conan the Barbarian day. A lot of people are mocking fun of the story line but why should we take a movie that seriously? Isn't that the purpose of going to movie is to escape from reality? In terms of entertainment factor, it's superb with plenty of actions & sarcastic jokes. Arnie gave us a superb performance & so does Gabriel Bryne (a very different role from his other movie touching on spirituality, Stigmata). Well, credit also have to be given to Peter Hyams, the action director who had also directed Van Damme in TimeCop. Highly recommended especially for Arnie's fan."
4,Awesome Soundtrack!,"Movie was great even though it was not Arnold's usual kick tail movie, he did get pushed around a little. Good plot of good versus evil. Soundtrack was AWESOME especially the earth shaking church scene. If you like good rumbling bass and surround sound, I recommend this movie for your DVD Library."
1,Not In The List of Schwarzenegger's good movies,"Among Schwarzenegger's good movies (not best), i can't consider this movie. This DVD will not give much satisfaction in terms of Sound Quality, Special Effects, or I can say even the movie as a whole when compared to Eraser (or Terminator-2 or True Lies or any other Schwarzenegger movie)"
4,"Its an action film, who needs a good plot?",Well Arnold did it again. This was an excellant action movie. The explosions were spectacular and the sound blew me away. I loved every minunte of it. Almost. There were a few scenes that didn't add to the story and nothing was blown up so I wondered why they were in there.The special features were great on the DVD. I always love it when they put music videos on them. If you want a great action movie I highly recomend this. If you are looking for a religious movie you better look somewhere else; Stigmata was good.
2,Pretty bad!,"The problem with ""End of Days"" was the Catholic Church getting in the way of a religous masterpiece.Major problems just get in the way:Cons: 1. Lead actresses incapability of acting. 2. Catholic churches protest hinders the ending (which was the biggest dissapointment).Pros: 1. Graphics.Make a wise decision. If you are looking for excellent graphics, you just might like this movie. Otherwise, it was a flop!!!"
2,This movie could have been better,"Arnold usually does not go wrong (he was really young when he did Hercules In New York, so let's give him a break) but this movie is surprisingly dull. I am not at all convinced that the actor who is supposed to be the Devil comes even close to fulfilling the expectations from his role. Overall, I don't think that the concept behind the script is bad (and even if it is, Arnold is notorious for compensating for such shortcomings by saying ""get down!"" or something)but everything else, including the supposed ""horror"" this movie ""inspires,"" is rather disappointing."
2,Not the worst movie Arnold has done.....,"Remember Last Action Hero? Well, this one is better, but that does not say much. Most action films have poor acting and this one is no exception, in fact, this one has worse acting than the usual. Not to mention, the lamest wisecracks this side of Adam Sandler. Don't get me wrong, there were a few good scenes. Unfortunately, it does not save the film from being just a special effects nightmare. GRADE: C-"
2,Not a HAPPY movie,End of Days is very dark and spooky. The only thing it has to show for is its amazing special effects. Other than that renting it would be a waste of time.
3,Not His Best,"While Arnold plays the heck out of the role he was paid to play as always, I think this movie lacked a good storyline. It was okay but nothing original. There were so many movies made last year about the end of the millennium that it kind of played out. I think they could have selected a better actress to play the female lead. The ending was kind of stupid but if you want to see an Arnold action movie, this is one of them but definitely not his best."

3,"Pretty cheesey, but love Byrne as Satan!","This movie was a relative disappointment. Don't get me wrong, I like Ahnold, I like apocalytic movies, and I LOVE Gabriel Byrne (in fact he was the best part of the whole movie!). But for the most part this movie dragged and lagged.The plot was pretty contrived, and seemed derivative of many other movies and books without being able to put it all together cohesively. It made sense on the surface, but there were a lot of continuity problems. However as long as you watch it without being too picky, it's an ok view."
3,A reasonable way to spend an evening!,"I watched this movie the other night, when for once the sun was shining in England, and I needed to get out of the summer sun! I think perhaps I should have watched it on a foggy November eve to create the full horror movie event, but still enjoyed this movie.This will never find its way into my top 10 list, but I thought there were enough original concepts to keep my interested. I thought it was well written, and didn't go down the cul-de-sac that many movies of the genre amble down, of relying too heavily on special effects. Byrne delivers a solid performance, as does Arnold, (NO attempt on the surname you notice!) who proves there is more to his reportoire than 'I'll be back', which I had long suspected.A reasonable movie, but certainly not in danger of any Oscars"
3,He's seen better days,"This film has a number of flaws and you have probably heard all of them by now. The biggest flaw is just that the script is not that strong. I think most devil movies just have problems not seeming corny and this film is no exception. If this was not an action film than it would have really flopped. There are a number of good action scenes and some sharp special effects. Schwarzenegger is strong at times as he plays a more beat-up character than usual. Gabriel Byrne does well, but seems bored at times. The bottom line is that the film is entertaining even if though it has a number of gaps. The DVD looks very sharp and has a number of extras. There is a behind the scenes segment, commentary and videos, but the coolest extra has to be the special effects section. This takes the viewer throught the process of how a number of the more spectular effects were done and it really helps one to appreciate what went into this film. Not a great film, but worth seeing."
1,an arrogant plot to boost man's ego,"Arnold you really blew it here, sorry. Plot was really bad. What arrogant pressumption that a cop with little faith can battle evil personified, who by the way, was bound by the need to get hitched by the year 2000? What total nonsense. Last Action Hero was even better than this movie. If you want nice Arnold movies, check out T2, True Lies, Conan, Batman3, those are the best I think."
3,Decent AHHHNOLD flick... Good for Arnie fans,"Good action, decent story, pretty good execution. Great line: "" YOU'RE A SCHOOL BOY COMPARED TO ME ! "". Regular movie viewers can take it or leave it, Arnold fans shouldn't be disappointed. It isn't Arnold's best ( True Lies and T2 are ) nor is it toward the bottom. On the Arnold Flick- A - Meter , it rates better than Eraser. P.S. I would have RATHER had the super action, super firepower ending as compared to the current ending. Arnold fans go to Arnold movies for the super action, don't deny us for the current ending."
2,"Dont buy, rent if you really want to see it","While I did enjoyed the beginning of this, it soon got to the point that it was far to easy to guess everything about to happen, and I was fighting to stay awake watching it.Very sad also when the devil with all his powers, which he shows in the film, cant beat a drunk who wants to kill himself.One of the worst by Arnold."
3,Your basic action adventure movie.,"Let's face it, when you hear Arnold Schwarzenegger you don't expect Hamlet; you expect in your face action. In that regard, this movie does not disappoint.The plot is predictable and there is nothing terribly innovating about this movie, but it's worth watching if you are into the action adventures or are a Schwarzenegger fan.Some of the special effects are amazing, and it's kind of fun to watch Arnold get the living hell beat out of him for a change. I didn't think I'd ever see him selling a punch from Gabriel Byrne.If you're looking for something that you'll watch over and over again then this movie is probably not for you. But it's good for the occasional viewing on nights where you have nothing to do.Strong language and nudity should keep kids away from this Arnie movie."
4,Could have been more,"This is overall a really fun movie to watch. However, in these religious-themed movies, the good guys usually win, so what would have made this movie truly stand out was if the Devil had won in the end and had his bride and everything, then this movie truly could have been called 'End of Days'."
4,One Of Arnold's Most Entertaining Movies,"Despite the hokey theology and overdone action, I still enjoyed this film and found it to be astounding in certain parts, thanks to some incredible special- effects, at least when it came out in 1999. They still look pretty cool. I also enjoyed the nice oveerall visuals and excellent sound.You just can't take the story seriously, but how many films can you, especially Arnold's wild movies? They are just there to be enjoyed, to get a couple of hours of escapism entertainment. Among the baloney, however, are a few profound statements of truth. Rod Steiger provides them as a priest in the film. Unfortunately, the devil (Gabriel Byrne) has some, too!Overall, the story is very involving, so much so that it that at 125 minutes it can wear you. About 15 minutes of less action would have been best. Still, it's one of Arnold's most entertaining movies."
2,Oh brother...,"There are some holes in logic that I'm willing to accept in some movies. But when it's a major part of the script I just can't take it. Arnold himself pretty much sums up this turkey with the most memorable line in the movie. When told that the Devil must mate with a woman between 11:00pm and midnight Arnold sneers and says ""Is that Eastern Time?""You got it, Arnie. 2 stars for him only."
1,GNR is the only reason this movie is good,GNR is the only reason this movie is good beacuse they're on the sound track/.
2,Not a Very Good Movie!,"For many years what seperated Arnold from Sly was the script choices. There was a strech were Arnold was in some awesome and orginal flicks. However End of Days is not one of them.The DVD contains a directors commentary. Why? So the director can talk about the bad story and acting? The film does have cool special effects but other than that its just plain old dumb.If you can rent this for $1.00 or less its not a bad deal. But I do not recommend full price renting or buying of this DVD. This film could have been potentially very good, the idea is neat but it fails on all levels.Arnold is great. I love almost all his films. This was not the comeback vehicle for him. You are better off waiting for T2 on DVD or watching Predetor or Total Recall.This movie was a waste of Arnold's talent and my time."
3,Ying Yang tight beats aight lyrics,Yeaht the beats be beaten' but the lyrics aren't something to talk about though. If you ask me Da Hol 9 a STL based rap group is about 10 times better and they aren't even commercial yet. Also 2 Da Abyss is better too another STL based rap group not yet on the commercial market either. Hopefully these two groups will come out with something commercialized. But until then I guess you people get the Ying Yang Twins.
2,REALLY NOT WORTH THE TIME OR MONEY,"The Ying Yang Twins definitely aren't one of my favorite rap groups. Sure, they can make a few stupid songs like ""Say I Yi Yi"" that get radio and videoplay for awhile, but as far as a really good album, no they can't do that. I'm giving this album 2 stars because it has ""Say I Yi Yi"" and ""By Myself"" which are hits that were enjoyable for a few minutes. This album might really be worth a dollar, but thats being generous. If you enjoy listening to a group of people who want to make noise instead of music, then this is for you. If you want good rap music, then go pick up Tupac's greatest hits."
5,Everyone should own one!,"This is the best suction cup magnifing mirror! Don't be discouraged by pass ones you may have purchased that fell off your mirror(usually in the middle of the night...go figure!) Anyway, I have bought several as gifts and everyone loves it. Just to add, Everyone should own one, better you see it first before someone else does!"
1,a disaster,"After two weeks of trying to implement e-mail instructions from Epson, this scanner still refused to work. I returned it to seller and was informed it was phased out by Epson. Good! Now no one else will suffer the frustrations of trying to get this scanner to operate."
5,"Great Scanner, Even for the novice","Bought this scanner from amazon, and I can't express how happy I am with it. First ordered the scanner last saturday, and it arrived on Wed., this was with the free shipping. As for the scanner I have been playing around with slides, negative and older b/w photo's. No complaints, and some very nice scans. I like the ability to have a large scanning area. I have been placing multiple b/w photo's of different sizes in the film area, then individually crop the photo's. The digital ice has been very good on some of the pictures that have seen better days. I would highly recommend this scanner."
3,An average offering from Germany's premier hard rock group,"I'm a rebel has no outstanding hits, sounds like an entire album of filler. Accept fans will enjoy it. It is a little softer than such mega hits as 'Princess of the Dawn' and 'Balls to the Wall'"
5,BENT INTO SHAPE,"One of Rainbow's best albums, every track is great, especially with the awesome SHM. Must have for any CD collection, but don't pay these ridiculous over-inflated rip off prices. I purchased mine from The Music Specialist on E Bay, save yourself a ton of cash!"
3,Omnimount 10lb Speaker Mount,"This speaker mount worked for what I needed it to do. However if you have a speaker that actually weighs 10LBS I would recommend getting the 20LB. Unless the one I got was defective, which I don't believe is the case. After installing this mount, the speakers didn't really stay in the position that I wanted them to be in. This happened no matter how much I tightened the mount. The speakers just slowly begin to slide down on the swivel until they rest on the lip of the bracket."
3,"Not bad, but only one...","I guess things that make sense to me don't always make sense to big-business. In this case, I'd anticipated receiving two of these for the purchase price and to my surprise, only one arrived. So, I returned the item. It did appear to be sturdy and of high quality, just realize that I never got to try the product, and my review is based solely on the external/packaged appearance of the item."
1,Needs review big time...,My sons and I could not find any sites... this info is to old...they need to use GPS...also I paid way to much for this item on Amazon I thought it would be fun...I wasted 200 dollars in gas plus ruined my boys love for ROK.You are best to save your money...the original price of the book was 3.00 dollars...what does that tell you ???? 1973 that was a long time ago very difficult directions...save your money on this one ...it is too bad!!!!!!!!!
2,Audio Quality,"I've been trying to collect the Kool & the Gang discography on CD, and let me say the West Germany made, early CD issue of ""In The Heart"" sounds horrendous. No high end, muffled, and very low volume.I can't speak for any other versions if there are any out there. If I was a Kool collector I would wait till this is remastered, or, if you don't want to wait forever, pick up a nice vinyl copy."
2,Don't drink the juice!,In this market I figured giving the statute a shot would be worth it. Put the statute in the ground almost six months ago...still no offer AND my house is price right in align with comps. I'm a believe but not a believer of this! For the price it was worth a try.
3,Hm...,"I admit to being partial to 'Fantasy Lover' and 'Night Pleasures'. It just went downhill from there.I was hoping with all my heart 'Seize the Night' will have the bite back, and it looked promissing... for the first few chapters.Afterwards... it lost the charm, the frivolty, the romance, and the action. It made me wanna cry with frustration.MILD SPOILER:What was that Acheron thing, anyway? Hello? Twilight Zone to the max!And passing around immortality like candy. Just plain nasty!No, ms. Kenyon has definitelly lost what she had at the beginning of this series. I suggest she finds it and pronto!"
1,I would gve it zero,"Stupid,dum,cheesy,boring.Plese dont buy this video.If you do you will see what I mean."
3,At times he is Nice at times he isn't,"..album was cool overall to me. My favorite track is The Ranger. Other smooth tracks are So Fly Ft. Snoop Dogg and Kat Williams, Put Ya Hands Up, Change, Don't Worry and How I Get Down. If you like mellow music i think you'll enjoy this CD. I wish him and DJ Quik would hook back up though cause he is at his best w/ Quik ont he beats."
3,I really wanted to love this book....,"I liked this book, but did not love it. At times, reading it was tedious; particularly the very long chapter that dealt with the mother's training as a dream interpreter. It took me over a month to read the book and it was good, but I expected great and it did not deliver."
3,Jester&#65533;s Fortune a big disappointment,"I am a HUGE Dewey Lambdin fan, own all his books, and even hunted down out-of-print copies for my library a few years back before they all became available. But I found Jester's Fortune to be a big disappointment. The setting and location are interesting, and as usual Mr. Lambdin has done his homework on the history. But almost nothing happens in the first 280 pages! The last 80 pages are typical of both Lambdin and Lewrie, and were fun and exciting. But it took me almost a month to wade through the first 280, as it never held my interest.Still, if you've read the rest of the series, you'll want to read this too. (Is that faint enough praise?) Three stars ONLY because the ending was good. Otherwise two."
3,Jester's Fortune,"It's an interesting story, along with his other novels, tho a bit gruesome towards the end.One problem i have with his books is that the foreigners speak their languages very ungrammatically! I can understand how an English sailor could mess up even French, but a Frenchman? This is very grating and there's no excuse for it. I even noticed a mistake in German, and my German is almost non-existent.My second beef is that his sailing talk is totally unintelligible. I don't understand C.S.Forester either, but he seems only to have the necessary minimum. When Lambdin talks about relative wind he's obviously 'going overboard'."
1,I love OXO products but this was a huge disappointment!,Mine broke on the 3rd use! No need to say anymore!
5,This is the scoop to buy!,"This scoop works great. I first tried the pointed ice cream scoop and couldn't use it. I have problems with my wrists. I have used other Oxo tools and love them, so I tried again with this scoop. It works so well it seems to be designed with me in mind. It is easy to dip out even the hardest ice cream now and the bail pops the ice cream out of the scoop --clean as a whistle. You can wash it in the dishwasher too."
1,"Started off fine, but then...","This scoop started off fine, but the spring broke rather quickly. Still used it for awhile, but was disappointed overall."
1,Junk Scoop!,"My sister bought one because she saw Ina Garten use one on her show for muffins and cupcakes. We were baking muffins for my niece's 1st birthday party and we bought the same exact one offline --it was completely useless. We made a batch of muffins with a tight batter and it just would not scoop out upon release. Took us about 4 hours to bake. I can't even imagine using this on ice creams. Needless to say --it went back to the store. I have theNorpro Stainless Steel Scoop, 56MM (4 Tablespoon)at home and it is so much better. Spent the extra money --you'll be glad you did."
2,must be chinese feet are much sfar too small. donated them to the needy.,normaly this would be my size.could barely get my foot in them. i think this was the only size available.looked well made but jusy wouldny fit. gave yhem to the needy.
2,Run very small,"I ordered these for my Dad for Christmas, but he wasn't able to get his feet in them. They were very small."
1,ORDER LARGER SIZE!!,"These were sold as mens size 11, both my son and my husband wear a size 10 1/2 shoe, neither of them can wear these slippers. They are at lease 1-2 sizes too small. The shipping was slower than advertised as well. The slippers themselves are solid and warm with a sturdy sole you can wear outdoors without fear. The only problem is they are much smaller than the marked size."
4,Its nice but,The products are made smaller than the spec. I bought size 9 even though I wear 8-1/2 shoes yet I have force them to put them on. They will keep your feet worm like they say. I suggest the other to buy at least a size larger.
3,Sized small,"My husband, wearing a size 9, could not get his foot inside this slipper. Will probably have to return and try a larger size."
2,Four hardcore heros strait out of a comic book.,"I gave this book a 4, when compared to other books of gratuitous violence written by people who have probably never been in harms way.The idea of this story is that Four highly trained and experienced soldiers, one from each of the 4 branches of the military, are assigned to protect the president and transport him to safety in the event of a nuclear exchange. They are, or course, equipped with a wide array of really cool guns and gadjets. They also have an arsenal of one liners and dry comments to spout when faced with combat.This book, and the others in this series, read like an ill conceived Arnold Schwarzenegger movie. If you like a good laugh, pick one up. The funniest thing about this series is that the author tries to remain techincal and serious, but just succeeds in sounding pretty silly.Richard Austin, by the way, is actually a guy named Victor Milian. Looks like even the author was embarrassed to be associated with these books."
4,Dorothy is a sleaze in the book,"When I see a film based on a novel, I like to read the novel to compare plots and execution. Most of the time the novel or story is fuller than the movie due to the short media time and the target audience. In this case, the novel does have a better-developed plot and is more cohesive. The characters are more true to form and there is a real Rosewood/Rosebrien. However, the book characters are more sinister and Dorothy is sleazy. I planed to make this the last story I would read by Dashiel Hammett. However, others tell me I just picked the wrong one to start with.The film on the other hand, was modified to give a lighter approach. It is the film that I will think of as the real ""Thin Man"" and Maureen O'Sullivan as the real Dorothy that was concerned about her father. Speaking about that, what is the Sullivan act?The Thin Man Starring: William Powell, Myrna Loy"
3,Not Hammett's best,"If you are looking for vintage, hard-boiled crime fiction this isn't it. While Hammett's talent is still evident, it is only wasted on this type of writintg. Don't get me wrong, this is not a bad book. It's just that the man who gave us The Continental Op and Sam Spade wrote this well after his writing had peaked. It is a very quick read because there isn't much to miss. Nick and Nora could best be described as one of the hardy boys marrying Nacy Drew, and then they become high society drunks who solve a mystery involving very one dimensional characters."
3,This album contains the blueprint of TSC's work to follow.,"Although the tracks on this debut album seem inconsistent, they demonstrate the versatility of Paul Weller and his partner Mick Talbot. The song Long Hot Summer is first rate!"
4,Dean Martin as the playboy photographer Matt Helm.,It is fun to watch these old '60s movies. It was such an innocent age for us looking back from the 21st Century. Who would have thought the 1960s were known as the 'Sexual Revolution' watching chaste movies like these?Pure fun and nostalga... with a tear for Sharon Tate...
3,Matt Helm Lounge,"Although Matt Helm is no James Bond you can't help but smile at Dean's antics. Most critics dislike the series, but if you don't treat the movies seriously, they can be a lot of fun."
5,Matt Helm,The quality of the DVDs are excellent. The quality of the movies are supurb. The set arrived on time and in good condition. The movies themselves takes me back to a time that was much more fun. Great purchase and alot of good times.
4,Inspiring and insightful,"Had the pleasure of taking a graduate-level course in project management from this author years ago. His books are every bit as engaging and motivational as his lectures. Wherever you are on the project management path, you'll benefit from Race Through the Forest. It's a relatively quick read that offers clarity, reassurance and encouragement."
1,bor & ing,"Look, I dig Elvis Costello & the Attractions but why the hell did they fire this guy after he wrote this? There's nothing really in here that is all that shocking or scandalous. The book reads like someone's diary and as a sort of rock travel essay put me to sleep. It's all the same--disconnected observations on nothingness. Some hit the right tone but others are just there and make you go ""So what's the big deal?""Compare this to some other books of this genre and this does not even hold a candle to many of the New Wave era."
1,Accidents Will Happen,"All of his anecdotes, jokes, and cringe-inducing puns imply that he views himself as the ultimate arbiter of taste and intellect. He's a great bass player."
2,"Tongs are awkward, not ergonomic","As mentioned on their individual product page, the tongs in this set are not particularly useful, at least for my average-sized hands. The handle is too long, so to grab things you have to grip closer down on the handle, which means your hand ends up closer to the grill flame. There also didn't seem to be much ""give"" in the tongs' hinge, which made gripping food difficult. I've never had a problem with Oxo tools before, but I abandoned these in favor of my old kitchen tongs.The other tools in the set seem fine, however. Perhaps it's better to buy individually."
4,Great swash-buckling and some interesting history,"Cornwell's ""Richard Sharpe"" series is a bunch of grand adventure tales, and a valuable source of history, especially of the Peninsular War against Napoleon. They do get a little repetitive in places, since the author can't tell if you have read any others of the series. Hence he has in every book to explain that the Baker rifle is slower to load than a musket, but more accurate; and he always has to belabor the point of the British army having officers of very mixed competence, due to their having bought their commissions instead of earning them. Perhaps the custom prevailed even later, since, in World War I it is said the German General Staff referred to the British soldiers as ""lions, led by donkeys."""
1,miserable movie,"I'm sorry, but this is just a ridiculous movie.To me, the writing is stilted and feels false, for lack of a better word. The acted is consistently overdone and the direction is so calculated and false (again) that, to my mind, this movie is simply a waste of time. As a study of supposedly ""kinky"" sex, again, just dumb; it feels to me to be so obviously done to titilate the mainstream.So many movies have been done so much better on so many levels than this thing. Just pathetic to see attention given to junk like this.As a comparison, I happened to see The Godfather just prior to this and the feel of the two movies in comparison was so striking that this utterly paled. Granted, few films stand a chance when put against The Godfather, but this was so abrupt I was astounded at the utter badness of Basic Instinct.Again, to me this is pure junk."
1,It's a shame,Poor Kirk Douglas ! His son Michael f## up any movie he plays in... And Sharon Stone is said to have the highest I.Q. in Hollywood. That is NOT proven at all by being in this lousy movie.May I remind you that Hollywood does not exist only since the 90s but back to the 40s 50s and 60s there are hundreds of MASTERPIECES you haven't even heard of -watch them and get smart instead of losing your time with violent artless movies
1,Broken Bootleg,I started ordering DVD's through Amazon only in the past year or so and have been satisfied with the 20 some movies I've ordered except for this one. The DVD I ordered from this outfit is far from DVD quality. No scratches or skips but blur. This product is not grainy or have any problems with pixels but it is completely blurry the whole way through. Very dissapointed.
1,Writer that has back is killer,"This isn't an intelligent film, even for American standards. The police are so dumb they couldn't find a giraffe in a field of wildebeasts. Even the US army would be able to find the killer in this movie.Having said that, this movie did make me quite hot. I walked down to the well and jumped in.Here in Africa most people don't wear clothes anyway so nudity alone isn't enough to satisfy me."
2,Not nearly as good the second time...,"Sharon Stone displays the extent of her, er, talent in the famous interrogation scene, but this movie is pretty stale the second time you see it. It's hard to remember what all the fuss was about."
5,"DIRECTOR'S CUT IS A MUST FOR COLLECTORS, LIKE ME......","This is the way Paul Verhoeven wanted it to be seen, and finally its come so that we can all see it. This edition of the video has the whole entire film, with out any cuts, any changes. The whole explicit sexy film, that even when you open the cover Paul writes a letter to the viewers. Its nice, SHARON STONE is the best actress in the world! This film put her ont he map, but I think this film is the map. There is not one movie in the world that is better than this, there are not even movies that come close to BASIC INSTINCT. A word of advice to the viewers, if your gonna see BASIC INSTINCT see the directors cut. It is special to my heart. Also this movie is encouraging a weird sex life, that I might want to smple when i get older. Even if I knew Catherine Trammell was going to hack me with an ice pick I would still sleep with her~!~"
1,Revisionist revenge chick flick rubbish,"On first viewing it's check out the architecture and guess the killer. On second viewing it's check out the clothes and guess the killer. On the third viewing it's the dawning realization that this is a revisionist feminist revenge chick flick (whatever that means) with few redeeming features made for the tackiest of Hollywood reasons - let's give the suckers what they want - sex, ice picks wielded by braless women under forty, and lots of expensive clothes and fast cars. The greatest suspense comes from the awful overacting Mr Douglas who is trying to give up smoking - will he? Won't he? Ms Stone iks embarrassingly bad. It is redeemed somewhat by Mr Dzundza and the elegant Ms Tripplehorn. And yes, I am a slow learner as this film made squillionsof dollars and I thought thousands of paying customers could not be wrong so I looked at it three times. And yes I am a sucker."
4,I need an icepick.,"Do you know why sex is always the downfall of men? Because even when their lives are in danger, they still have to pull out their wanker. That sums up Michael Douglas's character's stupidity here. I mean, for the entire film he suspects her of being a cold-blooded killer yet he allows himself to sleep with her and fall in love with her. He's so stupid. I don't know any ""magna cum laude p***y"" worth getting an icepick in the throat.But seriously, it's a movie where the sex scenes are actually integral to the plot. That alone makes it at least 4 stars. Seriously. The sex scenes are like suspense scenes. Each time they make love you're waiting for the icepick.This movie is also complex. To this day, people still debate as to whether the ending was really as simple as ""she killed them all."" Was Dr. Elisabeth Garner really as innocent as initially perceived? She seemed to have some issues and a few skeletons in her closet that could have been explored further."
4,Greatest Movie Ever,This is an amazing movie with one of the greatest story lines. It pulls you into the story. Sharon Stone has an iconic moment while being interrogated. Michael Douglas plays the deceived detective whose life is turned upside down by Stone's character. I love this movie.
1,Basically in-stinks,"One of the many sex-can-kill-you thrillers of the 80s and 90s, this one is particularly lame and offensive. The ending alone should invalidate anything worthy that precedes it. Is she or isn't she? When it becomes clear that even the screenwriter (Joe the Hutt) doesn't know, and doesn't care, and only wants to leave room for a sequel, the cynicism becomes palpable. The whole thing is an unintentional joke (sort of like Stone claiming she didn't know where the camera was positioned in the interrogation scene). Everything backfires -- even Stone's presumed sexuality is undermined by Tripplehorn's vastly superior looks and talent.If you want to see a good sex-equals-death thriller, check out ""Sea of Love."" Ellen Barkin makes Sharon Stone look like amateur night."
2,...and this is an award winner?,Some of the small moments are cute in this book but I wouldn't recommend it as a must-read. The author goes off on tangents and the literary writing is a bit over the top to sound like owners of a bed and breakfast.
2,Disappointed,"This is a GREAT story, brilliantly written. The audio version is a let down.It is titled 'unabridged' but parts of the book ARE missing. For instance when we first meet Mrs. Rochester - in the book we get a few paragraphs about Virgil & Hector's mother's dying moments. These paragraphs are censored on the audio version.While it was some curiosity value to hear the author's voice, his delivery is akin to an uninspired newsreader at times.The material means it will be good. I am sorry it is so pasteurised. It could have been so much better.B~Gal"
4,A very funny and slightly poignat book that goes by quickly.,"A friend gave me this book earlier this year as a birthday present. I had never heard of it but the minute I started reading I was taken with it. It is funny, quirky, and a little bittersweet. The bird was ridiculously funny!!Is this on par with the absolute greats of literature? Maybe, maybe not, but the feelings and images that it evoked in me are still with me! Highly recommended, especially if you like books...I mean really like books in an almost ""wierd"" way. You know who you are!"
3,Not for beginners,"Well I'm certainly not a professional in the field but I can recommend for those who are to read this book and keep it handy. I would suggest for any beginners in the field to start learning the basics of networking and obtaining a little hands on experience before reading this book. Over all though, its a pretty good book."
2,nice book,"A well written book by a GURU in network administration (Douglas Chick), the language used is simple to understand. I recommend this book, worth the bucks."
4,Solid Products,"The OXO can opener works very well and easily, due to the huge turning handle. That same handle makes it hard to store in a small space in a drawer. The lid opener is so-so ... a rubber grip works just as well."
4,Great for the under 5 crowd!,"When I first got this, my girls (ages 4 and 1) LOVED it. It was always in the car's DVD player. The songs are cute, the animation is colorful and the characters are easy for kids to relate with. Now that my older daughter is 5 1/2 she is begining to outgrow it. She thinks it is ""babyish"" - but I notice she never objests when her sister picks it.It has a good message, too. Responsibility and inner beauty. The main character (a little boy gingerbread) has to travel to the castle with his ""special gift"" for the great candy celebration. He encounters all of the well-known Candyland characters along the way and escapes from the evil Lord Licorice. He makes it to the castle only to find that the special gift is him! It is not complicated. There are no hidden jokes for Mom & Dad, no inuendo, nothing at all offensive. It is a very cute movie and if it gets your kids to play Candyland even more - GREAT!"
3,It was ok for my kid,It was ok for my kid my kids love candy land dvd and it music that they played love it
4,this cd is tight,bart is on fire ...block report is hott... it will be bumped by me ...thats for sure!!
3,Too Big!,I actually prefer the old yellow corn holders. These are just too big and bulky. They are well-made but just an overkill on the size.
3,Realistic horror/thriller with a focus on the devil inside.,"Streiber is a very clever and well-polished writer, and I have enjoyed his horror novels for a long time. Billy was one of his books that I never got around to reading at the time of publication.Unlike his other work, the horror does not have a supernatural theme. The plot has more in common with a mystery or thriller, but Streiber's natural feel for the horror genre lifts Barton from a criminal to a monster.The book is surprisingly realistic at times, almost to the point of sacrificing pace. I found the material compelling, but somehow not as well structured as some of Streiber's other books.Three and a half stars. Be aware, the book is very violent and deals with an extremely disturbing theme. It is not suitable for younger readers."
3,Do not buy this cd!,"Do not buy this cd! Buy ""Stone Cold Rhymin'"" which is Young MC's other cd. They call this his ""Greatest Hits"" but the truth is, ALL of the songs on this disc are on ONE of his albums (Stone Cold Rhymin') go look for yourself! It doesn't make any sense at all! This Greatest Hits cd only has 10 tracks. Stone Cold Rhymin which originally came out in 1989, has ALL 10 of the tracks on here, plus another three. AND it's the ORIGINAL album with the ORIGINAL track order and artwork etc. I love Young MC. The man can TRULY rhyme. The only reason I gave this a rating of 3 and not 5, is to prevent anyone from buying it because Stone Cold Rhymin' is a MUCH better buy."
2,P. Kilmos is right,"All 10 of the songs come from Stone Cold Rhymin', and the CD doesn't even take the best 10 songs from the album. This CD is an absolute waste of money. Get Stone Cold Rhymin' instead."
3,Not for grown-ups,"The basic approach to the book is interesting and effective. [...]. He doesn't identify tenses or indicate that different verb conjugations and noun declensions work differently. Exactly who does he think will be scared off by using correct terminology? How many semi-literates are interested in studying Greek? As Greek is a highly inflected language, the absence of proper identification for speech parts and verb forms leaves the student just memorizing dozens of different words without the grammatical structure in which to place and understand them.This book doesn't work well at all by itself."
2,Eye Opening,"This is a good book if you're looking into some insight into the possible experiences of gay Muslims in the US. However, this book graphically depicts severe physical and sexual abuse of a minor (Bilal) at the hands of his brother. So, be forewarned there. Also, I am interested into what sort of research Sulayman X conducted before writing this work as to my knowledge he is not Kurdish-American and converted to Islam in his 20's. Furthermore, the writing in this novel is very plain, the dialogue between characters is almost cartoonish at times, and parts of the plot seem simply unbelievable."
2,Not what I had in mind when i ordered it,"The spreader is much larger and wider than I wanted. I have found it useless for buttering bread sticks, which is why it was ordered.This is my fault and not that of the spreader."
3,I wasn't happy.,"The first time I put the spreader in the dishwasher, it came out with a bunch of small rust spots on the blade. I've tried to buff them out, but they are still there. It looks dirty so I don't even use it anymore."
4,Great for kids!,"I got one of these with an Oxo bagel holder, and frankly I don't use it all that often. My kids are another matter. They tell me this is MUCH easier to make PB&J sandwiches with. They use it for jelly on toast, making sandwiches, putting cream cheese or butter on a bagel, etc. If you're an adult accustomed to just grabbing the nearest table knife, I wouldn't bother. But if you've got kids, you might want to consider it. The smaller size and grippy handle seems to be easier for smaller hands to handle - and hey, they can make their own sandwiches to take to school!"
4,Does the job,"I have had this spreader for several years now. I really like it, but you have to take REALLY good care of it, or buy a new one every year or so. You must dry it immediately after washing, so that it won't rust (I wash mine in the dishwasher sometimes, but make sure to pull it out right away when it's done). Also, the grip at the bottom became unglued shortly after using it. This is possible due to me washing it in the dishwasher though.Now when I wash the spreader, I remove the handle (water will get into the handle and you don't want that), wash it by hand and dry it off. Then I let it set a few hours more, and put the item back together again. If this sounds like too much hassle for you, then you might look elsewhere."
4,Big n Sharp,"This pizza cutter has a real big wheel and is extremely sharp when you get it. My wife cut one of those little personal pan pizza into eighths without removing the cheesy top part. It just cut right through. You may want to put the pizza on a cutting board, I have a feeling that in pan cutting will dull the blade eventually."
3,Works fine but HUGE,"I wasn't reading very closely when I ordered this pizza cutter. I just picked one from OXO since that brand has been recommended to me. I didn't take a second to visualize the size of a 4"" wheel. It is enormous. I can't imagine ever needing a wheel so large and it takes up an excessive amount of space. I can't think of any reason to get this wheel instead of a normal-sized wheel.Works fine."
2,Worked great until the handle fell off...,I received this as a gift from my aunt. I was impressed until several years into having it the handle fell off. I've since had other Oxo Good Grips kitchen utensils and they all have problems after a year or two...I don't think I'll be buying Oxo again in the future.
3,Nothing to write home about...,It's okay. You can easily sit through it. I'm a Ryan Gosling fan so I watch all his movies. Don't know if I would have watched it had he not been in it.
5,The best I've seen in awhile,"I tend to shy away from movies, but the acting performances here, along with the plot itself, changed my mind! Sandra Bullock does an excellent job portraying an out-of-character damaged detective. She and her partner spar throughout the film, all which creates exchanges of acting genius.The overly psychological aspects of the film are what make it such an excellent presentation. From two suburban boys of varying personalities, to investigators in the same predicament, Murder by Numbers is chillingly entrancing. It offers an escape to a sinister world of corruption, greed, and selfishness, with bits of action intertwined. The movie will keep you awake, and you'll be grateful, for you'll be able to pick out the many hidden nuances peppered through-out the two hours."
4,Follow the crumbs,"Sandra Bullock does a great job of playing a detective looking for a murderer. The clues are a bit to neat to suit her and she begins to look deeper. This movie was borderline Hitchcock style murder mystery and very smoothly done. Just a little stronger acting by Ben Chaplin and Ryan Gosling and it would have been a major hit. They do a good job but they are not the caliber of Ed Norton in ""Primal Fear"". If they were they would have got at least oscar nominations if not awards. I still think they turn in fine performances and were not appreciated. I personally think the whole movie was underrated. I think it improves with additional viewings. You begin to truly appreciate the performances and the story. A Hitchcock air about it that makes you think of ""The Rope"" and ""Vertigo"". I bought the DVD and I recommend it. Most fans of movies like ""Kiss the Girls"" and ""Along Came a Spider"" will enjoy it."
4,Simple but Good,"A simple murder story but executed very well, characters were realistic and could be your next door neighbor. Sandra Bullock still rocks...."
3,More thrills. Less Drama.,"Murder by Numbers is one of those thrillers that could have been really scary but instead waters down some of its thrills with with too much melo drama, in my opinion. Some people really like that idea.Sensational acting, and direction a definetly highlights.Their's one main plot and 2 side plots in Murder by Numbers. The main plot is basicly about two really smart highschool students who feel rejected by the world so kill a person. They hope then their work will matter to someone ealse. Sandra Bullock is on the case....Its too unbeliveable. If they took out the other side plots it might have been closer to perfection."
2,Warmed-over TV thriller,"Slightly more interesting than your average made-for-TV thriller playing on cable stations Saturday afternoons, Murder By Numbers has a lot of interesting scenarios that end up clashing with each other in a the big, unappetizing stew that is this movie. Only recommended for huge Sandra Bullock fans."
5,Generic battery that works,"Excellent battery for my Panasonic phone. I thought the phone was dead because it kept turning on and off for no reason, but it turns out that it was the battery. Installing this solved the problems and I can use the phone again. I've only had this for about a month though, so if I have any problems I'll come back and post an update."
3,Out there mandolin music..,"David and Andy really step out to a different plane on this album. This is not the easiest album to listen to. I relate it to Miles Davis in the 70's, or John Coltrane in his later years. David and Andy don't always follow a nice pretty melody, but this is still a powerfull album."
2,Too many negative interpretations,"This dream dictionary,more than any other I've has more of a pesemistic outlook for the querent than most dictionaries. Perhaps the gloomy images are just a reflection of the days in which the book was written (1940's?) I won't knock the book completely because no other dream dictionary offers as many dream inter- pretations as this one. One does get their money's worth if that if quanity of dreams is the main qualifier. Myself, I do use the book on occasion and still enjoy it somewhat, but remember, many of today's common symbols like computers,televisions and other hi-tech symbols aren't listed.This is why I give the 10,000 dreams a score of 2 out of 5."
4,"Really tells the meanings of my dreams,fun for the family","If your'e looking for a book that tells the truth about your dreams,this isn't the book for you.But,I think it is''really'' fun to read the myths that they put in there and if one of your dreams will give you misfortune or constant luck in the future.So what i'm trying to say is ''This is a really good book and i would definately recommend this book to dream lovers all around the world!!''"
5,Easy on the hands,"Small, compact and easy on my hands. I retired my original OXO can opener after using it over ten years."
3,good for a year's use,this is good for about a year's use - before rust builds up around the hinge and you have to wrestle with it to pry it open.
1,Rusted Solid,This was a great can opener...until it rusted. The gears ceased turning. But I liked it enough to replace it with the stainless version.
5,the truth is the light,"I never thought I would enjoy getting a bible-based lesson wrapped in such a comedic package. Whether you laugh or holla..the truth is the truth.Sister Betty and her congregants have provided a way to enjoy learning about God's love and seeing our own inaccuracies in such a wonderful and unusual way. I look forward to reading more from this author.My entire bookclub enjoyed this book and I see the Williamston, SC (Pelzer, SC) where the fictional church is set has given it a wonderful review."
3,Rhino edition 2003: Warning: This is a remix,"I wish someone had told me, so I'm telling you. This is a ""dry"" remix that somebody thought would approximate concert sound. It does not sound like the original release. Instruments appear at higher or lower levels, in different positions. Also: the CD is very loud, so this ""improved"" version includes distortion."
5,PERFECT,"There's no such thing as objetivity, and I ain't gonna try to reach it anyway. This record is simply PERFECT, that is all I can say. No even a minimal flaw. Not at all. Majestic beauty."
3,Recommended,"As a Grateful Dead CD I would actually give this 4 stars. A great companion piece to the first album. I am not a true fan (I don't dig the live 17-minute space jams) but I love the San Francsico music scene in the mid to late 60's and the early Dead were a big part of it. Studio songs on the first CD are usually less than 3 minutes long. Live CD a little longer but nothing exceeding 8 minutes. Definately more of a ""Pigpen"" ruled affair at this point but I love their covers and songs, and the approach. Harmonies fix most vocal weaknesses within. Trippy yet restrained in blues and folk-rock traditions. Will recommend this CD only after Working Man's Dead, American Beauty, First album."
2,Anarchist's Second Chance,"A 19th century anarchist is given a second chance at life at the end of a 20th century.The premise is inventive and I wanted to like this, but...I got only partway through this before putting it aside. Parts were nice, but the crude and socialistic aspects were too much. This is definitely not for teens."
3,Almost perfect,"I love the connectors, it makes connecting this product very easy, except for one little problem:There are 4 wires to connect and only 3 connectors!!Call me crazy if you want, but I think there is a serious step missing in the planning process here:Step one: slide ends of white wires into connector, close and crimp.Step two: slide ends of brown wires into connector, close and crimp.Step three: slide ends of yellow wires into connector, close and crimp.Step four: slide ends of green wires into connector, wait a minute...what connector!?!So I will give three stars, one for each of the connectors; too bad, one connector more would have boosted it to Five Stars!"
5,Baby I'm yours,i will read this again and again - also have a paperback copy on my bookshelf at home - -
3,Baby I'm yours,It was ok. A little dry and slow. It kept my attention just enough to get me through the book.
3,"Entertaining, but . . .","I bought ""Baby I'm Yours"" after reading ""Be My Baby,"" and I was a little disappointed.There are some cute situations in BIY, and I like it that Catherine's rotten sister eventually found a few redeeming qualities, but I had a hard time sympathizing with a twin who would knowingly let her sister take the fall for a crime.The ""hero"" is a jerk and a half, and it's difficult to believe the two will live happily ever after in a world full of other opportunities.I think the whole sign-language-thing could have been developed better, and it came off looking like a device instead of a bonafide plot twist.Regardless, it was interesting to see how Ms. Andersen has grown in writing talent since BIY, and I look forward to reading her next book."
5,"HOT, HOT, HOT","A sexy, funny and fun romp. Bounty hunter nabs the wrong twin and they're off on a wild journey. This was my first Susan Andersen book and convinced me to by ALL her books. Great fun!"
2,A little over the top,"Hi! This book had potential apart from the... title, and so could have been better. The annoying thing about books like these is when they get a little bit too excited in their drum-beating and flag-waving. The principles that the book celebrates are real and important. But one attitude displayed prominently in is the conceit of falling into the trap of thinking we are the only democratic or free nation in the world. Other very successful democracies also uphold and illustrate important values and democratic and egalitarian ideals.Read books like this, but read them with an open and enquiring mind, and try not to be isolationist (or elitist) when you celebrate our American conceptions of democracy - otherwise you are in danger of betraying those very values!"
2,Disappointing attempt for a valid project,"The original American experiment with democracy was a brave and intrepid one, with amazing results. The spirit of the pioneering Moms and Dads and later waves of immigrants and the pragmatic values they contributed have built a great nation over the past several hundred years. Cataloguing these values is an important project.Sadly this book disappoints. It is overly biased and provides an uncrtical and overly romanticised version of America that is insular, proud and superior - and that is not a very American or democratic message at all!!I do not recommend this book to people trying to get in touch with their individual American spirit."
2,"Good voices, but.....","If you like good singing and good voices, this may be the CD for you. If, however, you like Broadway cast recordings for the acting and emotions, you might want to skip this. If this were my first introduction to this play, I'd no doubt wonder what all the excitment was about. Everything is a little too ""bubble gum"" for my taste. Very little emotion can be felt in the singing. Robert Torti as Pharoah is about the only standout.If you want good acting with your singing, try the video tape version. It has much more depth of sound and feeling than this one."
4,Very Good But Other Albums Are Better,"The classic story of Joseph and his multicolored coat in musical form! This is a good album if you wanna hear pretty voices singing, but if you want energy and passion, I suggest finding a different version of this musical's soundtrack like the Canadian version.Five Best TracksAny Dream Will DoOne More Angel In HeavenGo, Go, Go JosephThose Canaan DaysFinale: Any Dream Will Do/Give Me My Coloured Coat"
2,12 Gauge wire - yer right!,"The product supplied was not what it claims to be - 12AWG cable. It is realistically a 16 gauge wire (at best). The spool and wire supplied was not the same as the product displayed on Amazon either (only similarity was the product discription on the label). Given I live in New Zealand, it was unrealistic to return the product due to shipping costs...have subsequently purchased some Monster Cable on Amazon(5 stars there).If you want a quality 12 gauge cable, do not purchase this product! If you have very low product expectations, this product may suit your needs."
5,Works for me!,I've had this wine opener for about a year and I won't use anything else. All you need to do is twist and pull! I've never had a cork break or leave cork remnants more than any other opener.I recieved the rabbit opener last Christmas and still haven't taken it out of the package since I still love the ease of this inexpensive gadget.
5,HUGE FUN FROM TEEN AUTHOR,I'm so happy I found this book! Even though the author is a teen it is well written and tightly plotted. Reminded of everything I loved about Harry Potter and Artemis Fowl and it's such a fun read. My favorite characters are Arianna and Digorence.
1,Typical white-male misogyny,"A man I met (purely by accident) suggested I purchase this CD - so I thought I'd try it. I guess the joke was on me. I mean, this was more of the same-old, except taken to the extreeeeem! These ""men"" think they are God's gift, the whole time putting down anything without a 10"" ""love prong"" Who do they think they're fooling? These are scared little boys - with large guitars (and that's about it). ""Working"" on a Sex-Farm? I'm sorry but I (nor any woman I know) wants to be ""plowed like a bean-field"" or ""stuck with [his] pitch-fork""!!! I even heard (the usually acceptable) Rob Riener made a movie about these perverts! Is the whole male world going crazy?"
3,Leg openings are too tight,"This is the suit I am looking for, not the baggy surfing shorts that are everywhere, but not the skimpy Speedo of racers, just a decent lap swimming suit. BUT the leg openings were made for those with a very very, slim build. I also run and lift. Wish Speedo would put some more give in the leg openings. I am trying one size up and then calling it done."
5,a comic gem.,"Robin Williams, Danny Devito, Edward Norton, John Stewart. This movie amazing. The world of children's media isn't as ""squeaky clean"" as it seems, and it takes a purple rhino with the best of intentions to try and redeem it in the most comedic fashion possible. This movie is a must watch!"
4,Randolphs Demise,"I really enjoyed this movie.The plot is simple enough,Rainbow Randolph (Robin Williams) is fired from his children based televisions siries.Now the spot is open for another children show,so an acoustic wielding Sheldon Mopes (Edward Norton) is hired for the spot.He plays a purple rhino(Smoochy) and acts in a kinder way to the children and is alot better offstage then Rainbow Randolph ever was.Randolph soon becomes wacked in the head and soon attempts anything to get his role back.Leading to some hilarious moments on the stage and off the stage and all about the city.The more Smoochy gains attention and popularity the more crazed Randolph becomes.Very good acting,really funny,and alittle slow a rental is a good idea."
5,A LAUGH-A-MINUTE!!,"Oh wow, this was such an insane, rollicking ride. This film is pure genius, poking fun at the sanctity of something involving...GASP.....CHILDREN!!. Oh yes, we know, YOU SHOULDN""T DO THAT.....whine, whine, snivel, whine!!! Just pull the stick out of your a$$ and prepare to have a good, long laugh at this irreverent rollercoaster of ironic brilliance."
5,FUNNY FUNNY!,"This is one funny movie, very very dark but all the same, it's just down right FUNNY. Who ever claimes to dislike this movie, well that issue is yours. People have to lighten up, and this A list filled movie will make you crack up with LAUGHTER.This is for sure a movie for adults. It is witty and touches on the crazy world of Television. Recommend for any adults that has a good sence of humor. Ed Norton and Robin Williams are just amazing, silly But TOOOOOOOOOOO FUNNY !"
2,death to smoochy,"robin williams fans,stay home .this film was a major disapointment and is the second movie in 40 years we walked out of. the kids might like it but mr. de vito did not deliver on this one. save your money."
3,"NOT TERRIBLE, NOT GREAT","SHORT AND SWEET, ONE THE SWEARING AND THE RACY MOOD OF THE FILM I THINK MADE IT A FOLP AT THE BOX OFFICE. PEOPLE DON'T GO TO SEE ROBIN WILLIAMS SAY THE F WORD TWENTY TIMES IN LESS HE'S LIVE AND THEN THAT'S A WHOLE NEW LEVEL. NO SUBSTANCE WAS THE PROBLEM. WHEN IT ENDED I SAID OK. BUT THE NEXT DAY TRADED IT IN . NOT VERY FUNNY AND I LIKE ANY HUMOR PERIOD, DARK, LIGHT, SLAPSTICK. BUT DO NOT LIKE FILMS LIKE POLICE ACADAMY OR AIRPORT BECSAUSE THAT'S STUPID HUMOR AND I CAN'T FIND ANYTHING FUNNY ABOUT THOSE COMEDYS, BUT, THE CHEAP DETECTIVE, MY FELLOW AMERICANS, BEATLE JUICE ARE MORE MY KIND OF COMEDYS. YOU WANT TO RENT IT. THAT'S OK I BOUGHT IT FOR FIVE DOLLARS AND GOT RID OF IT BECAUSE I KNEW I WOULD NEVER WATCH IT AGAIN. NOT AS BAD AS THEY SAY BUT NOT WORTH KEEPING OR WATCHING TWICE, THAT'S TORCHERPEACE HB"
1,Death to this Movie...hopefully,"I don't see what is the deal with the high praise in some reviews that this movie is getting. This is a lame attempt at comedy at best. Profanity is not humor. Sure, I get the part about wanting to satirize the whole Barney thing, but this movie just tries too hard with little in the way of script or acting. Edward Norton and Robin Williams aren't funny at all. It was a hard movie to get through, but I was just hoping it would either be over, or get better.It did end, at least."
2,Might have been fun,"Robin Williams is a comic genius, and the scenes with him on screen are worth watching (too bad he doesn't have more screen time). And Harvey Fierstein is always entertaining. Danny Woodburn does a great job as the chief ""little person"" on the Smoochy show. The comic premise of the movie sounded promising, but it's weighed down by a leaden script, with a silly and unfunny gangster subplot and an utterly unbelievable romantic plot thrown in. The film generates maybe half a dozen chuckles in all. The DVD includes a commentary by director Danny deVito which is largely devoted to telling how much fun the movie was to make. Too bad it's not much fun to watch."
3,"Eh, not bad not great","I'm a big Edward Norton fan, and he was really good as Smoochy in this movie. Although, I thought the movie was pretty stupid. This movie was about a man who really wanted to be the host of a children's show as the character, Smoochy (a purple dinosaur/dragon type thing). Robin William's character used to be on a hit chilren's show, and when he hears of a new show featuring Smoochy, replacing his old show, he hires someone to kill Edward Norton. It's got a few funny parts, but overall I thought it was a bad movie."
5,The Critics Can Go to the Nether Regions,"Seriously... just look at the other reviews on this page. As of when I wrote this review, I only saw one negative remark. If you're unsure about it, rent it, or ask someone who ACTUALLY saw it! I've only met one person who didn't like this movie (sadly, it's my room mate; but he's just an idiot to begin with). So, technical stuff: you can get a synopsis further up in the editorial review, other than that, the performances by Danny DeVito, Robin Williams, and Edward Norton are fantastic. The entire theming is well done. There were a lot of ideas that were used, so just keep your eyes open and laugh at the funny stuff (like the head of a charity getting his head chopped off by an Irish mob). Remember: ""friends come in all sizes""."
5,one of the greatest in its class...,"In league with 'Lebowski, Fargo, an Powers' ability to connect the viewer to the characters we hate, take simple subject matter and make it darkly humorous all while spoofing commercialism in one funny film. Well casted and directed, this rates in the top ten of all timer funny ass films of all time."
3,Funny--the first time,"I loved this movie in the theater--giggling throughout. The only complaint I had at the time was that Robin Williams went into a few of his stock manic rants (how many times are we going to hear his speech of the various euphemisms for a male body part?). I thought Ed Norton was wonderful, and I walked out of the theater laughing about the ""Step Dad"" song.However, when I watched it again, I just found it dull, dull, dull.The humor is dark and definitely not for everyone. If you like it the first time, watch it again before adding it to your permanent collection."
2,"Nice, but leaks","I was given this as a gift....it does a great job keeping our wines chilled and it looks great too. However, it leaks water from the melted ice. Very disappointed for the price."
3,Right-Handed,"It seems ok, but it's only for rightys... much more difficult to peel ""away"" from yourself than towards yourself."
1,does Not work,"Feels really good in the hand but does not have the sharp cutting action to do anything, also the holes were not large enough, the angle for the pass was not made correctly, I could not get one single little bit of zest from lemons, limes, oranges ..... Had to return it and get another brand. (I had given my good zester to a friend is the only reason I needed a new one ... sure wish I knew what that other brand was)"
4,"Nice, but...","This is a pretty good zester. It has a very comfortable grip and it's easy to clean. It was perfect for my needs, but if you want a very fine zest this is not the product for you. It's really only practical if you don't mind a little bit thicker zest."
4,"Great ""Trios"" Going Fast","It is a real shame that so many Original Jazz Classics CDs have been deleted in the past year, with George Wallington's ""Trios"" one of the numerous victims. This disc collects two of the pianist's old Prestige 10""s -- tracks 1-8 recorded on September 4, 1952 featuring either Charles Mingus or Oscar Pettiford on bass and Max Roach on drums, and tracks 9-15 recorded on May 25, 1953 and featuring Curly Russell on bass and Roach again on drums. Wallington was one of the most inventive jazz composers of the early 1950s, and this collection features ten of his originals. The only deterrent here is the average sound quality, otherwise this is a great set -- get it while you can."
3,"Boy, this is a tough one...","...because the music is really fascinating. Wallington was doing some amazing work at the keyboard in these early '50s sets, and you'll want to listen to the cuts over and over.If you can hear them, that is. As was noted elsewhere, the sound quality is very problematic -- it actually sounds as if this recording was made off of vinyl, with some scratches in it. So frustrating: better versions of this must exist out there, but this particular pressing puts your ears, and patience, to the test.So the choice is yours. Great music -- but hard to listen to."
5,So funny,"I loved this stand comedy before I made the purchase. Martin is so funny! I decided to add this to my personal collection, the quality is good and I received it in a timely manner"
2,"Martin Lawrence is a funny guy, just not a funny stand-up.","I first watched this when I was in middle school and thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen. I then re-watched it a year ago and didn't laugh one time. It wasn't because I had heard the jokes before, but because he just wasn't funny. If you ask most stand-up fans, they will tell you that Martin Lawrence just is not a good stand-up comedian."
2,Unoriginal Richard Pryor tryhard,"I bought this video and was very disappointed. I know Martin to be a great actor but simply, he does not cut it as a stand up. Most of his material used in ""You so Crazy"" is Richard Pryor material. Stuff like masturbation,drug use, differences in black and white people, acting like a kid when he gets a hot female, etc are taken from Richard Pryor Live in Concert, Live in the Sunset Strip etc..."
1,The worst stand up performance ever!,"This is undeniably the worst stand up performance ever.Martin Lawrence is a decent actor.Big Momma's House is hilarious.But in stand up,he can't joke his way out of a paper bag.Almost every other word is a swear word.I don't mind swearing,but it can get old fast.Also,the topics discussed in this DVD are the same topics every black comedian has talked about:race,drugs,and sex.When Richard Pryor and Chris Rock do this,it can be funny.When Martin and other certain comedians do it,it is not funny.His routine on racism is the most racist routine of all time.His impression of a white man is really annoying.If you want to hear a good impression of a white man,check out Dave Chappelle's ""Killin' Them Softly.""He is hilarious.Steer clear of this and Runteldat""."
4,HILARIOUS,"In this DVD, Martin covers everything from Rodney King to childhood crushes. Flavored with his own unique brand of ""tell it like it is"" humor, You So Crazy is a must-have for the comedy collection."
2,Don't tell me why,"I have been extremely disappointed with this. I could not find anything in there that would be interesting. I could not find items that I was interested in explaining to my 9-year old grandson, and he was not interested by the book at all. So the material I saw was factual, but largely irrelevant and uninteresting."
1,Alice Lackluster,Don't know to whom this would appeal.Fine actors wasted on this attempt to breathe new life into a wonderful Victorian Era story. Nothing like the Wizard of Oz for fantasy and visual excitement. Young viewers I showed this to were immediately bored with its pseudo intellectualisms even an adult would tire of.
2,THE METAL RIPPED?,"Imagine my suprise when after less than a year of use, the metal grid broke, bending outward while pressing a clove of garlic. Very dissapointing. And while my hands never slipped of the ""non-slip grip"" the grips themselfs often (every use) slipped down on the metal handles. I think I'll try another brand this time!"
2,I wouldn't buy it again...,"I bought this garlic press about 5 years ago. It has done a good job for the past 5 years, but a month ago it broke on me. I didn't do anything extraordinary. I was just using the press like normal and the hinge broke. Also, the black rubber handles slide back and forth allowing water to get into the handles"
1,Junk,"This is junk, made of cheap pot metal. Like another reviewer said, we wrote off the first one breaking but then the second one broke doing what it was supposed to do.It's a nice looking product but don't waste your money."
2,Unimpressed with OXO products,"I really liked this garlic press, until the metal broke. It has not undergone heavy use and was not that old. I haven't fared much better with other Good Grips products - I purchased two dish scrubbers in a row and BOTH broke within a month of use. After the garlic press, I am not sure that I will purchase Good Grips products again. They feel like they should be sturdy, and the rubberized handles are comfortable, but they don't hold up. Considering their cost, it's unacceptable. I do like their measuring spoons, however."
1,metal will break within a year,"I have had 2 'OXO Good Grips Garlic' presses. It presses garlic nicely and feels good to hold, however, both of my presses broke (metal broke) within a year. I currently need another press and am looking for a different brand. I will never buy an OXO garlic press again."
3,Will give you about a year of normal use,"Just wanted to add my experience to others here who've had their press break after about a year. The hinge breaks and is essentially un-repairable. However it's comfortable and does a good job. So if you don't mind spending (dollar amount) every year or so for a new one, this is a a good press."
2,Garlic Press,"I have the Kuhn Rikon garlic press and I much prefer that little gem to the OXO. For one thing, the OXO is much harder to use. I'm not a weak person, and I usually have to use both hands or have my husband help me with this one. I can use the Kuhn Rikon without peeling the garlic cloves and that is impossible with the OXO. The grippy handle on the OXO seems to retain the garlic odor where the complete stainless steel construction of the Kuhn Rikon means that there is never a residual garlic smell after washing. The Kuhn Rikon is easier to wash, too. I have not had my OXO break yet, like some others have mentioned, but I don't use it very often. I usually like OXO products, so I am very disappointed with this tool."
1,Ours snapped,"Ours snapped, under normal use -- not at the hinge, but on the shaft connecting the handle to the sieve half of the press. You wouldn't think a thick stainless steel shaft could snap under hand pressure. And probably it couldn't. But this press is not made of stainless steel. Once it snapped, we could see that it was made of some kind of semi-porous composite material with a chrome finish that makes it look like solid metal."
2,Not for those who are serious about garlic,"If you put a large clove in this one, you will be hard pressed (ha, ha) to squeeze it through unless you have large, strong hands. Mine ended up in the trash after one of the handles snapped clean off."
2,There HAS to be a better press than this!,"Like others here, I've owned this press for a few years. It was great in the beginning; easy to clean and use. No problems with the handles, in fact I loved them. I have cleaned it both in the dishwasher and by hand.However, after a few years of infrequent use, it became harder to clean for whatever reason. Then it became more difficult to mince garlic with it and then finally the thing broke at the hinge, again, like others here.If you want something pretty to put in your kitchen and intend to only use it once or twice a year, buy this one. If you intend to make good use of your garlic press and want something that LASTS, keep looking!"
2,Loved it 'til it broke. I'll try Hoffritz.,"Like other reviewers, I like the ergonomics of OXO. However, they haven't quite perfected this garlic press. The rubber handles slid off a couple of times in the year I had this. Easy enough to push them back up. But the metal snapped on mine too. Clear enough that they are not using good quality metal. I would rather they charge twice as much for a well made product than expect me to keep buying defective merchandise. A garlic press should last forever."
1,Mine broke too!,"Oh why, oh why didn't I read the trusty Amazon reviews before I bought my OXO garlic press? I really liked my press and was very excited about it. Then one day I was pressing an ordinary garlic clove and it snapped into two pieces. It was less than 3 months old. What a disappointment! Don't buy this product; it's defective."
4,Beautiful observations of nature,"Over Prairie Trails describes the writer's weekly travels between his teaching position in one town & his family's home in another. It takes place in the Canadian prairie sometime soon after WWI. The writer travels back & forth with his two horses pulling a buggy or sleigh depending on the weather. He describes the most memorable of these journeys. His observations of nature are extremely detailed and interesting. It did get tedious at times, but the descriptions made it worth reading."
1,Bad recipes,"This is a lovely, cheerfully written cookbook, and only one recipe I have prepared from it has been any good. The rest are boring and flavorless. I love casseroles, but I've finally given up on this book.Update 11/12/2007: OK, so I didn't give up. I just made the San Antonio Chili Casserole. Sounded good: chili with a cornbread topping. Did he leave out ingredients for the cornbread or what? Butter and eggs and nothing else? Added some buttermilk, and although the chili wasn't terrible -- standard beans (lots of beans) and ground beef -- the recipe had to be tweaked too much to call it a success. Get some Junior League or community church cookbook if you want these recipes -- anything!Update 01/26/2009: OK, because I am a masochist (and apparently a sadist to my family), I tried one more recipe (Mamie's Ham and Black-Eyed Pea Supper), and I now plan to permanently delete anything by Mr. Villas from my recipe file. You have been warned."
2,These are too much work!,"To me, the whole point of a casserole is ""quick and easy,"" so I want recipes where I just dump things into the casserole dish and put them in the oven. But, like many other casserole and ""hot dish"" cookbooks, most of the recipes in this book require you to do a tremendous amount of cooking and prep before you put the stuff in the casserole dish -- and, since the ingredients are already cooked, why do they need an hour of baking time? Answer: so they can be called ""casseroles"" or ""one-dish meals"". Most of these things could be stirred together and served right after the stove-top cooking process (maybe with minor adjustments), without wasting another hour in the oven. I would also add that many of these casseroles are loaded with butter and are too fattening for me. I took this book out of the library and photocopied about a dozen things -- that was it."
4,"well, almost...","Rhino has by and large done right by the Love catalog over the years, but they just miss the mark here. No ""Message to Pretty""? No ""Castle""? No ""August""? Tsk, tsk, tsk... should've taken care of business before chasing after later tracks. And I really don't know that the lengthy ""You Set the Scene"" belongs on an abbreviated best-of like this. Of course, this does have the great Rhino sound and packaging, but my recommendation would be to splurge for the two disc _Love Story_ set. It's worth it."
3,gooey,"I found it messy to use. Maybe next time I'll try the strips that come prewaxed. I liked the scent. It removed hair reasonably well. But both times I used it, wax got dripped all around."
5,Good quality and fast shipping!,"This bible is the perfect size, and also very good quality of paper and the cover is thick and has good support.I ordered it and it came very quick"
5,Love this CD,I already had this as a cassette and am glad to see it in mp3 form. This has been one of my favorite albums to listen to.
4,The best ice cream scoop I've ever had,"I received this as a present a few years ago and absolutely love it. I honestly wondered why an ice-cream scoop needed non-stick coating, but it really does help! It does cut through hard ice cream with no problem and it's really easy to make official-looking scoops like you see the pros do it! I especially liked the ""beak"" part of it. I tried to use a regular scoop at a friend's house and had a hard time of it! Sounds silly, but once you get used to that pointy beak (I use it to push ice cream down into the cone itself) it's almost impossible to use the wide-bowl of a normal scoop! The only reason I couldn't give this 5 stars was because I had to toss it due to the non-stick coating coming off eventually. I'm positive it had to do with being run through the dishwasher, even though it said it was dishwasher-safe. But, even with that fault, I would buy it again!"
4,Dishwasher Safe,Bought this to replace an aluminum scoop which couldn't be washed in the dishwasher (aluminum seems to tarnish from the detergent). Really like the handle and it comes out of the dishwasher looking like new.
2,Falling Apart Faster Than Kim Kardashian's Marriage,"Only a couple of washings and the threads just keep unraveling; snags easily. Only lasted less than a year. Now I am looking for a qualitly robe that will last, LL Bean!"
4,Spiritual divorce,"This book came highly recommended by my therapist and I see why. Also note that it is not based in religion. Do not confuse spiritual with a set belief system. I was not the party that was left in my marriage as was the author. I do find her insight on recoverying ones true self helpful. Healing verses stuffing the pain and telling yourself that time heals all wounds, it does not."
4,Comfort and Support,"This is a very insightful, sensitive and comprehensive map to help anyone deal with pain in general, not relationship pains only. I loved it! I also love the idea of turning negative events into something positive for yourself. Thank you Debbie."
2,Expecting More,"If you've already got a pretty good handle on your divorce or separation, skip this book. I was expecting to discuss how to use my divorce as a springboard for an authentic, self -actualized life; instead I got lessons in how to put myself in my spouse's shoes, and other words of advice useful in salvaging what's left of the relationship with my spouse. I've done that work, I've agononized over this decision and see my present/future relationship with my spouse as business I have to attend to, in a professional way, as we raise our son. I'm past my spouse, and wish him nothing but the best as we continue to co-parent our son. Divorce will be the catalyst for my extraordinary life, but it will be a life I forge without the help of this book."
3,"Why, Pat, Why?","Oddly, they used to say Ornette's music was just noise. Yet, if you listen now, it's positively conservative. This CD pits two of Coleman's alums with Metheny for a program on which a Horace Silver composition is the best track. But Pat couldn't seem to resist ruining what is otherwise a great record with his 9-minute noise experiment, ""The Calling."" This is a pretty short CD at about 44 mins, so 9 of them are a waste. I'm betting he would never put this on a CD like this today. It disrupts the flow. Maybe we'll be saying this sounds conservative someday, too. But I doubt it."
3,Good product,"These wands work as advertised. I can not believe the cost. I was in a bind to get the garage in order when I bought them. They arrived on time and there was no problems with them. Having said that, I could have bought PVC pipe and made my own adapter for one tenth of the cost. I later bought rubber pipe clamp reducers and 20' of PVC pipe for $6.oo and I made several other extentions. All dust collecting products are overpriced and can be replaced with stronger hand made attachments at a very low cost. Go to a country hardward store and they will fix you up with all the parts you need to make several connectors and extentions. Take the money you save and buy a stake dinner on your way home."
1,"Useless, Horrible, and Filled with Typos!","This book was filled with an unbelievable number of mistakes. On every test, it always gives wrong line numbers and misspells many, many, many words. Often (a few times a page) it forgets to leave spaces between words. There are no tables to convert your sample tests into SAT scores. And to top it off, the answer guide is often wrong. This was the worst $10 that I have ever spent. Save yourself money, don't buy this horrible book!"
2,Don't buy this!!!,I just took the exam today and I know first hand this book doesn't have a clue about what they are talking about. If you use this book you will fail the exam. I am almost tempted to write these people for my money back. It is a terrible book.
2,I agree Lots of errors and misleading info.,Book seemed to have many errors. Many times I had to go to the W3 to check to make sure I was not taught wrong. Thumbs down on this book.
2,Very weak in HTML,"This book gets some basic, high-level Internet information correct, but there are many errors. While a network engineer may scoff at the networking chapters, it does seem to cover the topics required for the exam. From a programmer's perspective, the HTML and programming chapters are poorly done. According to the author's bio, this is a book written by a person with networking experience, but very little programming experience, and it shows.This book is useful as a review of information you have learned elsewhere if you approach it with the goal of finding all of the errors. Typos are one thing, factual errors are unacceptable.The rating is two stars due to the networking content. Otherwise, it would be one star."
1,garbage,"I got a fabulous price on this vac - $99 from Menards. I returned it after 3 weeks. I have a 1500 sq ft home with multi surface floors. We do not live like pigs - every single time we vacuumed the floor (i/e daily) we nearly lost all suction by the time we were finished. The top filter would clog. Decided not just to give up and took to a local vac shop/warranty center. They told us it was typical and recommended returning to where it was purchased. Absolute garbage. Incidentally, we used a Dyson DC07 for 3 years until it became too expensive to repair."
4,"Pricey, but good","We have two and have given 2-3 as gifts. Everyone loves them. They are solid and sturdy. Just the right weight. So far, no rusting or chipping. They feel good and are easy to use.The crackers work much better than the ones we've had for 30 years (and which probably cost 99 cents at the time). There is no wobble in the hinge and the large middle cracking area is perfect for just cracking crab and lobster legs without crushing them.The picks are well made. The forked design works much better than the curved single-tine picks and the spoon scoop end easily finishes the job.This set is expensive. Many sets are available for half or less. That's the reason for only 4 stars. I have not compared the quality of the cheaper sets, so maybe these are really worth the extra. I'm glad we have them."
4,Functional and Stylish!,"I cook a lot of Alaskan King Crab Legs so was looking for something to give my hands a break. First of all, these look great, sleek silver with black rubber grips. The crackers feel solid in the hand and are easy to grip. They worked well in breaking up different sized crab legs. The little scoopers make it convenient to get the meat out of the hard to reach areas.I would have to concur with an earlier reviewer that the package is a big pain to open. I literally had to use a big cutting knife to get everything out. Once you get past that though, nothing but quality."
2,Complicated,"I bought the entire set and it is pretty difficult to do (if you don't have any experience with yoga like I do). It really should be marketed to those who already have extensive yoga experience. Also the ballet moves are simple but require lots of flexibility (so if you're not flexible, it will not be as useful). The hip hop part takes some getting used to and is so cheesy that I cringe! This series is way more complicated then they make it seem. I rarely use this set and would recommend going with another, less complicated series."

3,Okay,I had just seen the commercials for this when I bought it. It is not as much active dance as I thought. I resold it later and am trying a different video now.
2,Starts great - ends with a wimper,"I thought I was liking this book, but the more I read, I just wasn't sure. The reviewer who said the ending was ""pathetic"" was correct. For my taste - far too many words to say little."
5,This is a book I want to own.,Four Letters of Love is one of the most beautifully written books I have ever read. It has the eloquent mysticism of the ancient Irish legends with the clarity of the twentieth century.Your hopes are dashed and lifted to Heaven on the same page. Anyone who's ever been in love will understand this story. Anyone who has been compelled to follow a dream will have lived this story. Anyone who IS in love will love this story.While I wait for Niall Williams's next novel I will be spending my time reading the books he and his wife have written about living in Ireland.
4,Great bread knife,"We got this knife after receiving a breadmaker as a gift. A sharp bread knife is a must for cutting fresh bread without reducing it to crumbs, and this knife does just that. It has the nice ""good Grips"" handle and is a good length. It is nice and sharp and for the price, I'll probably just replace it if it gets too dull. It is not the fanciest knife I own, but it does the intended job nicely and at a great price. Good, basic bread knife!"
5,I loved it!,"It was very good. It was very descriptive and i really couldn't put it down. It made me feel like a wolf sort of. The way that the wolves are such a tight nit group is amazing, especially how well they work together. All the problems in this book are very realistic, like rabies and lack of food and such. I recommend this book to anyone."
5,an exclent look into the lives of a family of wolves,"This book is a wondeful and discriptive book. You feel like you know the chacters, a good book should do that. This is a heart warming story. This book is great for all people who love stories about famiy, love, trust, teamwork, and of course wolves."
5,A Great Book!,"This book about Julie's famed wolf pack really caught my eye in the bookstore. I had recently read Julie of the Wolves and was about to buy the sequel, Julie when the final episode in the trilogy caught me. I decided to buy both Julie and Julie's Wolf Pack. This proved an excellent choice. I loved reading about the wolf pack's struggle to survive against disease, hunger, and cold. In the end, I was almost in tears. It is a wonderful book worth reading, full of beautiful descriptions of a wolf's hard life."
5,My Favorite Book of All time,"This book is one of the most incredible books I have ever read. I had never read Julie of the Wolves, or Julie, but I had read this one. It is about a wolf pack wit hthe alpha male (Kapu), and their struggles with rabies, dying, Julie, studies, humans, and other things. Julie is a Inuit living in alaska. She had raised Kapu when she was trying to survive in the wild. She is friends with all the wolves, and she is treated with respect. I have read this book over twenty times (and i am NOT exaggerating. I REAlly have read the book twenty times.) And you know what? Its good whether you read it once or 1000 times. Try this book out for yourself."
5,an interesting book from a wolf's point of view.,"Julie's Wolf Pack was a extermly good book. I happen to be a Jean Craighead George a this has to be one of her best works. I enjoyed the moments that happen from the wolves point of view. I liked the additions and subtractions of the wolves in the pack. Jean, if you read this, write another book like this!"
3,Well....,I must admit that this is a good book but it could have been better. The characters are likeable and this is a sequal to Ms. Martin's Heartless so there are charcters from that story as well included here. The problem with this story is that it became rather tiresome at the ending due to the fact that there was a complete lack of communication between the hero Clayton and his headstrong wife Kitt. Although this could be a way to move a story along I felt that both characters being stubborn and unwilling to speak of their feelings for each other bordered on the unbelievable. It almost seemed as if Ms. Martin was tring to fill up a page quota. The end result was that I did not care much what happen between these two characters and only completed the book since I had invested so much time reading the previous 300 pages. The fire may have been inside but it lacked heat needed to be combustable.
4,Wow another Martin winner for me.,"I was surprised at all the bad reviews. I really loved this book. To me Clay and Kitt really were an intense couple and they grabbed me from the very beginning. I loved the way Clay managed to get Kitt to have to marry him, what a switch that was. And of course she had no idea until much later when it really impacted how she felt about him and their troubled marriage. She had some difficult issues for them to overcome but Clay was amazing through that and you just had to love this guy. Shocking that it is Kitt that leaves him and he is devastated. Of course these women just were always afraid of those mistresses back then. But Clay had given her no reason to worry. It was great seeing her come back and have to prove herself to him. That was rather a switch from the usual the guy having to prove themselves. For me this was another winner by Kat Martin. I just do not think this woman is capable of anything less than a 4 or 5 star book."
1,A bust if you use XP,Can't get Painter 9 to work on XP at all. Very frustrating. And here I was thinking Corel must have finally figured out how to release software without major bugs. Won't buy anything from these guys again.
2,Interesting but buggy,"And I mean ""buggy"" as in this piece of software will suddenly crash and leave you with an UNOPENABLE file, not useable at all -- goodbye to who knows how many hours of work?It's interesting software and it's great with a Wacom tablet, but Corel just doesn't seem to be able to get their stuff together and I'm certainly not in a hurry to spend MORE money on a new version hoping they got it right.I mean, expecting to be able to save and re-open a file is not asking for the moon."
5,great knife for the price,Cuts right through my whole grain breads no problem. You can't beat the price.
3,It was Swell...,"I generally liked the show. Nice Gene information. One thing bothered me, though. I wasn't aware that Frank Sinatra and Gene were the ONLY stars in Anchors Aweigh. Now my only question is, ""Was it Gene or Frank that wore the wig and played Aunt Susie?"""
5,A brilliant bio-docu worthy of Gene Kelly's genius!,"Every once in a while a biographical documentary comes along that transcends the genre and is a worthy film into and of itself. Very often those shows have been part of the wonderful AMERICAN MASTERS series on PBS, and GENE KELLY:ANATOMY OF A DANCER is probably the best I haev ever seen. Intelligent, cogent, and taking a decidedly non-traditional approach, the film is made with the same kind of meticulous care that its subject put into his filmmaking, choreography, and performing.The interviews are provocative, the clips not predictable, and always entertaining. It's shows like this that remind us what cinematic life portraits used to be like before ...Truly 'S wonderful!"
2,Letter writing is nor just for Business,"This is a good book for those who are in school or trying to gain entrance into the employment arena. However, I was looking to write a personal thank you note to friends or meeting new persons. This book never mentions this type subject except from a business approach. The book is on my self in case a need arises."
4,A must for Malazan Fans,"Blood Follows is a must read for fans of the Malazan World created by Erikson and Esslemont.The only drawback to this novella is that it is ...a novella, it could have been a few hundred pages longer!It is the story of how Mancy (Emancipor Reese) comes to be stuck working for Bauchelain and Broach, a couple of off kilter people with way to much power.If you like this then you need to pick up The Healthy Dead (by Erikson) and Night of Knives (another Malazan novella, this one by Eriksons co-creator Cam Esslemont"
2,Lame-O,"I saw Jackie open for Susan Tedeschi a week ago and for the first two songs I was impressed by how talented this guy is. He can play everything and he can play everything very well. He has a great voice with great control, but he's got no soul. The music is very cheesy and predictable. After a few songs, which all start sounding the same, I was so bored that I was regretting buying the tickets to see Susan. I acutally felt sorry for the musicians that he hires because there's no way anyone that I know would want to play this without getting some $$.Thankfully Susan came out and kicked ass and made me completely forget about this guy. When I was leaving someone was talking about how his recordings were great so I checked out this disc to give him one more try, but it's just safe poppy middle of the road music. It's just like Coldplay, Eric Clapton, or even Hootie and the Blowfish...safe radio friendly music. Jackie please stay away from the blues because you just don't have it in you."
3,"Works, but not well enough that we'll throw away our broken one yet","Like all oxo products, the handle on this product is excellent. The part that actually does the cutting, though, is thin and lightweight so that it buckles while in use and doesn't always cut clean pieces. Most of the time it functions adequately, it just feels cheap and flimsy.Our old slicer had a very solid cutting surface, but the handle broke. We duct-taped it together to last us just until the new one arrived, but it's still better than this one we just got."
1,Miles' Nastiest Album Ever!,"This album contains an embarrassing ""rap"" and an even more offensive cover with Miles and a toy gun. Insulting to my intelligence, this album should be banned. I've heard Miles empty his spit valves with better musicality. Stay away! END"
5,cool jazz mixed with post modern at the very best!,"The two covers (Human Nature & Time After Time) make this worth the purchase alone. Ms. Morrisine and Katia bring out the best of Miles. Even though this CD is mostly post modern, his cool jazz touch evolves the music into a totally new strain. Rest in peace Miles, we miss you..."
5,they work as advertised (with the proper filter),"add a HEPA filter (the red one) and say goodbye to even the finest dust. I used one of these while finishing the inside of my garage with a Porter Cable drywall sanding machine (also unusually good). Didn't even have to move the cars out to sand the new walls! Very, very impressive."
3,More details please,"I purchased the one song - Feels Like Home - only because it was used in 'Michael' and it rightly acknowledged Bonnie Raitt as doing the vocal. I would presume Randy Newman performed the background music? In the song list they gave LR credit, why not BR?On the broader stage I have always respected Randy Newman's musical talent, both writing and singing."
4,A Good Fine And Game To Play,"Played part of this game back in 1996 when it first came out. Being married and having kids at the time,they wanted to play with the disc to,but not in the computer. :( They thought it made a good flying saucer until it crash landed.Corey Feldman gives voice to the main character,Kent Knutson. I recall the puzzles I did play challenging,but not hair pulling frustration. The 3D graphics are good for 1996 standards. The game is compatible with the latest version of Dosbox,so I don't expect much trouble getting this to work. If you're not familiar with Dosbox,do a Google search for it,then start making a list of Dos and Windows 3.1 games,there are some really good classic adventure gaming out there. I be happy to provide a list if you message me."
4,A good posthumous album,"This is really not bad, I didn't expect much from a posthumous album, and yet I found that most of John's songs are quite good, especially the sweet ""Grow old with me"" and the rocking ""Nobody told me"". Surprisingly, Yoko's songs are quite nice as well, definitely better than the ones in ""Double fantasy""; the best one is probably ""Your hands"". In the end, a good album."
5,Home Alone,"Real family interactions and lots of fun. This is a feel good family movie. We have watched it every year and because I lent it out to one of my very handicapped little patients, so I had to buy another DVD."
5,great purchase!,i love this movie and it works just fine! it was worth the buy to relive childhood memories! great purchase!
4,Funny and Classic,This is a classic Christmas time kids movie. A must watch (though I always felt the second one was the best)
5,Great,Our kids (4-5year olds) loved the antics. There was peels of laughter coming from the kids and hearty bellows from the adults watching the kids. Overall a great show.
5,1 Kid+2 stupid crimanals= funny movie,"The extended McCallister family is celebrating Christmas by going to Paris. This would not be a problem, but because of some funny situations the day they leave they do not realize that they left 10 year old Kevin at home. When Kevin finds out he makes the most of it until he hears that two criminals Marv and Harry say that they are going to rob the house that night.While Kevin is getting ready to ambush the bad guys his mother Kate is trying to get home to make sure he is ok. What happens when Marv and Harry to get into the house? Will Kate make it back in time? Watch Home Alone"
5,Very funny!,"I like the part when Kevin turned on the TV. The guy in the TV started talking. Both to the pizza delivery guy and Marv. ""Leave it on the doorstep and get outta here."" was one of the things the guy in the TV said. What's next? Watch it to find out! It was just hilarious! I recommend it to people to like a good laugh."
5,Thankyou Amazon.com,I highly recommend Amazon.com to purchase anything from. I find they have the cheapest prices and my order is sent out immediately. I love these guys and will continue to shop throughout the year with Amazon.com. I have been ordering items since last April and throughout Christmas this year and have never had a problem. I receive all my items in just a few days. I can't ask for anything better than that. Thank you again for being there for me when I need or want something.....Gwen Aquinto
5,Great family movie!,This is a wonderful family movie! I LOVE it! This kid in it just makes you crack up just looking at him and he plays his part great!
2,'never got why this was such a hit.,"I just happened to see this again after 25+ years since my 6 year old wanted to see it. We chose to watch it because we both had just watched (for free) ""Home Alone 3""---which I thought would surely be total junk. The odd thing is---we both really liked the ""third installment."" It was ridiculous---hilariously ridiculous. We both howled with laughter. It's a ""total cartoon."" Now---you may dismiss my review, but I am here to tell you that my 6 year old felt the same way. He LOVED ""Home Alone 3,"" but ""Home Alone,"" downloaded for $3.99, was ho-hum in contrast. The movie always aggravated me with its gratuitous ""Ahhhhhhhh"" from Culkin, but its biggest offense is that it tries to be a cartoon and real movie at the same time. I'm sorry, but I feel one has to choose sides. Clearly, we preferred the slapstick nonsense of the third movie to the overall ""important"" nonsense of the first one."
5,One of the best Christmas movies ever,"There are two movies that must be watched with the kids over Christmas, ""Christmas Story"" and ""Home Alone"". If had been a few years since I watched Home Alone, but I thought it would be a good year to introduce it to my 3 year old. He loved the move and I still find it to be timeless."
3,Funny Holiday Movie,I remembered this as a classic as I was a kid but did not realized there was so much foul language in the beginning. Still funny tho.
3,"Low Definition, Buffering","The movie was in low definition, which got worse as we watched it. It also paused and buffered a few times. We are used to Netflix, which has very good video quality and never buffers."
3,Why changing when people like the way you are,"I have Rhett's previous albums and I have seen him on stage. I do not see any reason why Rhett should change anything as far as he's good with what he's doing. In pop music or any other kind of music it is hard to make a difference between some artists, you can't even learn from the lyrics which are all so poor.So come on Rhett be faithfull to your music and your fans. Domi"
3,Cute... not great game... but still cute,"Just got this for my 6-year old. He loves the show (as do I!) so couldn't resist.The games are so-so... very far from state of the art. But, for a 6-year old, dead on. Much older? You'll get bored soon enough. But, what the heck... it's a fine novelty for the price.-- mm"
2,disapointed,"This CD collection is difficult to use. Book chapters are not identified on the lable or in individual CDs it is broken in to 30 second sound bites, which makes it easy to pause for a moment but difficult to find the begining of a chapter since the chapter may begin at 20 seconds in to the sound bite. Want to listen on your ipod good luck with hundreds of unnamed tracks. My students and I gave up and went back to the old audio tapes where we could find the chapter we wanted to listen to with out jugling 16 unlabled CDs"
1,Horrible Kindle Edition,"This is a horrible Kindle edition. Buyer beware. Many, many errors in the text, missing parts of sentences and then those missing parts showing up randomly in other locations of the text. I will attempt to get my money back on this.EDIT: I contacted Amazon, explained the problem with the text and received a full refund. Customer service mentioned that they would contact the publisher about the errors in the text and I'd be notified upon correction. Three cheers for Amazon.com!"
4,Good read,Free book again and it was worth the price lol . I really enjoyed this book and you should enjoy it too.
5,TIMELESS,"MY 6TH GRADE TEACHER READ THIS TO THE CLASS BACK IN THE DAY. IT WAS SOMETHING I COULD NEVER FORGET. I READ IT FOR MYSELF AND I AM STILL BLOWN AWAY BY IT. IT IS HEARTBREAKING AND INSPIRING, FILLS YOU WITH FURRY AND TRULY MAKES YOU THINK. IT IS TIMELESS. THE IMPACT THE RELEASE OF THIS BOOK HAD ON THE PUBLIC MUST HAVE BEEN SOMETHING."
3,Uncle Toms Cabin,I really like this book. I tried to read it when I was real young but couldnt get into it. Its good on the kindle because the dictionary is so readially available for words that are not like our modern vocabulary.
5,IT'S THE BEST!!!!!!!!!!,"My name's Julia Greenberg I am in 4th grade and I am a good reader. If I were not a good reader I would not understand the book, THANKFULLY i'm a good reader! This book was my very favorite book! I would recomend this book for 15 or over ages, because some words are HARD for younger ages( unless your an advanced reader!"
4,Uncle Tom's Cabin Review,"Uncle Tom's Cabin is a novel that touched many people's lives including my own. It made me realize just how lucky I am to be living like I am today. Harriet Beecher Stowe takes us through the lives of two slaves, Tom and Eliza. We read about their triumphs and hardships that they go through in order to get one thing. Freedom. There are just a few things that I didn't enjoy about this book. The dialogue that takes place in Uncle Tom's Cabin was a little more difficult to understand than what I am normally used too. Another thing that I didn't really like was all the details about the punishments that the slaves had to endure. Overall, I think that this book is a book that everyone should have the opportunity to read. I am very glad that I read this book."
4,Must read,This book is a must read for those who want to look back try to understand what happened In this time period
1,A miserably failed allegory,"Slavery was ugly. We need to know that. But not the way Stowe writes, I felt like I couldn't bear another page. Unbelievably flat characters in an unbelievably flat setting. Stowe wrote sophomorically about a place she had never been, and instead of creating a good book about the horrors and issues of slavery, she wrote characters who were exaggerated caricatures, from Eliza to Uncle Tom to Simon Legree. Little Eva? Please. I didn't shed a tear. Maybe it worked as propaganda then but I've read much better since."
2,Uncle Tom's Cabin,"Sorry, I know this is a classic, but the writing, grammar, spelling, typos, etc forced me to do something I rarely ever do-I stopped after chapter two and did not finish this book. Sadly disappointed."
2,Hard to read,"When I ordered this book I didn't realize it would be so hard to read. I had always heard about this book but never read it, I still haven't. It has too much slang and half words in it. For as well known as it is I don't know how anybody read it. The story behind it is probably a very good story, but I couldn't understand enough of it to read more than the first chapter then it was placed on the book shelf. And I now know why it looks new and was sold as used, the fist purchaser probably couldn't read it either."
4,Uncle Tom's Cabin,An eye-opening book about a time that we did not live in but should know about. Perhaps too many sermons and extra words but the important points are there and brought out for all to see.
4,DR,"Harriet Beecher really captured the terrible goings on in the south.The separation of family and the bouncing around from good to bad.The psychological aftermath was definitely horrendous,I hated to read it but I had to read it."
2,Not the best book,I had trouble getting through this book. I don't understand why people thought this book was so good.
2,Not what I expected,Didn't care for it. Literature from another time that does not hold up. More of a moral pamphlet than literature. I had not read this before and was disappointed after giving it a chance.
1,They Crawl...the movie crawls...B.O.R.I.N.G,"It seems to be a nice cockroach buggie creepie-crawlie show, but it turns out to be this extremely BORING detective movie. The majority of the movie is a stupid criminal investigation. Hardly any roaches in it. BOOORRRING. The entire movie crawls slowly and it's hard to keep your interest. Mostly dialogue. Dullsville.If you have insomnia, watch it."
1,the only thing worse than this movie is the cover art.....,"Ok, now you would think this would be about killer cockroaches and how terrifying it is to be eaten by bugs. (Warning spoilers ahead) ... You have explosions here, explosions there, and gun fights, and drama, and lots and lots of talking, and high tech computer equipment getting trashed. What about the bugs you ask? well lets see, you see them in action only a few times, and they kill 4 people, 3 you don't even see the bugs touch the people, and the last well, is so badly computer generated it wasn't even worth rewinding to get a better look. The film itself is excellent quality, not low budget at all. The cover art, looks like some re-re-re-release rehash of some 1960's sci-fi embarassment newly released. ..."
2,i have seen all the asia argento movies this one is a dud,"Michael Madsen kinda made watchen it a chore, is voice can hardly be heard ...find it hard to hear with the volume cranked up....you mite need a Michael Madsen translator?the story is a little to basic , found it hard to stay awake, not worth watchen twice ..rent if you want to ZZZZZZZzzzzzzzz."
5,...post pop-punk for boys and girls in need of a spanking,this is possibly the best release of 1999. it's an amalgamation of apolitical sensibility and 80's cheez. it's like punk came down and mated with the Go-Go's. fabulous. fabulous.
2,"Great for a party, not for deep thought...","My fondest memory of this CD is dancing with a bunch of friends in a half-empty to ""Hot Topic"". I immediately rushed out and bought the whole CD, ready for more fun. After listening to it a few times, I'm not quite as excited. The musicians seem to be having fun, but that alone won't make it good. There's a real ""Hey Girls, let's start a band!"" slumber-party feel to it. I feel like a few too many people told them they were really good and they swelled heads and put out a full CD before they tightened up their act."
5,Excellent Meat Tenderizer,"Very excellent product. A good weight to it for really tenderizing whatever meat you are preparing (chicken, steak, etc...) The two-sided mallot works well, where you can use the flat side on chicken so as not to make a mess, and the dimpled side does a great job on tougher meats like beef to really tender them up. I would highly recommend this item and given the choice I would definitely buy it again."
2,"OK, but not great","This does the job fine, but if I had it to do over again, I would have gotten an all stainless one. Not being able to put this in the dishwasher is a huge drawback. My two favorite words are ""dishwasher safe,"" but to not be able to put something that touches raw poultry in the diswasher is insult to injury. I am pricing others and it looks like I'll be dropping at least $18."
1,WOULD NOT RECOMMEND,ITALIAN PARSLEY JUST BRUISED INSTEAD OF CUT. CHIVES AND BASIL DID NOT FAIR AS WELL EITHER. I DIDN'T WANT TO RUIN ANY OTHER HERBS SO I JUST STOPPED THERE. THE CONCEPT SEEMED SO GREAT AND I WAS SO EXCITED TO FIND A PRODUCT THAT WOULD HELP WITH SUCH A TEDIOUS TASK UNTIL I TRIED IT.
1,Horrible B Horror,"This movie is really bad. There is no real story, a mysterious signal is transmitted through phones and TVs and drive pepole to violence, and that is all it is, no plot, no nothing just endless violence. There is no explanation for what is going on and the movie is just bad. Also the mix of bloody violence and goofy humor that can be good, is done horrible here. The movie failed to entertain me in any way. Some pepole may like this becouse it is indy, some seam to think anything indy is automatically good but in truth this movie is trash and nothing else."
1,The Signal,"I will stop buying Blu-ray movies, until I can rent/view them. I think this movie and another (About a monster in manhattan) were done by amateur people or very, very low budgeted. That was money down the drain."
2,Patrick Moraz is no Rick Wakeman,"I guess I don't hear what everyone else is hearing? The follow up to ""Tales.."" doesn't even come close. The main reason is because Rick Wakeman left the band and was replaced by Patrick Moraz.Don't get me wrong, Moraz is a top notch keyboardist, but doesn't even measure up to Rick Wakeman. Wakeman split because he thought the band was starting to go too mainsteam and he wanted to continue his ideas with the solo approach.Of the pre-80's Yes albums, this is the one I listen to the least. ""Sound Chaser"" is OK, but the rest of the album gets old quick. If you're a Rick Wakeman nut like myself then this album will disappoint you."
5,It's about time,"I always thought the initital recording of this album was dull and faint. This remastering brightens the album up and gives it more respect that it deserves. I read a previous review that the lows are too low and the highs are trimmed and that this takes from the guitar tone. I didn't think so.In a nutshell the album is more dynamic, but doesn't deviate from the original recording."
5,Great album,"If you already purchased the YES Original masters that were issued in the early 90's...the only thing you're gaining here are the bonus tracks...and you might want to talk to somebody who already scored these new remasters...to see if the liner notes are the same as the originals....as they tend to cut, add or mutilate the original package in an attempt to update.I have every one of the original masters from the 90's and dont intend on parting with them...or investing in a complete new library...considering the sound on my existing cd's is excellent."
1,What a dumb song.,"What this song amounts to, basically, is another ""advertisment"" for Darkchild; the producer Rodney Jenkins. While Jenkins is a good producer, must he say--or have his name said --in the song? This was what Puffy did and now he is gone. And I was never thrilled with him and his materialistic boasting all up in the song. He really spoiled Faith Evans song All Night Long doing that.Now about the song and Toni Braxton; This song is a backward step for Mrs. Braxton who has paid her dues with her debut album. This song seems like something the yet mature TLC would do aside from that No Scrubs garbage they put out a couple years back. Toni Braxton is of a higher caliber than this.Note; this cd single has a David Morales radio mix for You're Making Me High, a butt-kicker from 1996. Short and sweet and to the point."
5,keeps the dust where it belongs,I like this model as it has greater filtration than most Shop-Vac bags. They keep the dust inside the ShopVac. We moved into a newly built home when purchasing these and they were put to frequent use. They hold up well and perform as I expected. I would purchase again.
2,poor design,When installed this bag hits the motor and support structure in the middle of the vacuum. This causes the bag NOT to open up and there for actually blocks the vacuum from working
5,Fantastic CD,The beautiful love songs recorded by Nat King Cole were digitally remastered and the sound is great. This is a bargain at the price and includes some of his greatest hits.
1,FALSE ADVERTISING!,"I wish I had read the one review of this item prior to purchasing it, because it would have saved me time and disappointment. I echo everything it stated. I expected to receive an assortment of six rubber ducks, but instead only received one! I would never have purchased one rubber duck for $10. The picture and description of this product are completely misleading. Save your money and do NOT buy this product from this seller! Buy rubber ducks somewhere else! On a positive note, Amazon resolved this matter quickly for me without any hassle. I was issued a full refund without paying any return shipping costs."
1,Not what I purchased!,"I thought I was buying ""polka dot duck assorted"" however I recieved only 1 rubber duck! 1 duck for $15! That is crazy!! I returned this item through Amazon and got a full refund including shipping. I am very pleased with Amazon, NOT with this seller!!!"
5,a musical Bartlett's,"I originally ordered this book to identify a theme by Chopin. I have found it and I am practicing it on the piano. I know that even 10,000 themes from the classical repertoire have to be discriminatory and that I won't find everything, but I am confident that this will be a useful reference work. I have not found anything like it in Italy."
2,Country Cheese,"Before we get into this too far, I have to say: I knew all about the Grateful Dead from friends but I had never bought an LP (or ripped a bootleg) so from say - 1972 - to today (2009) I had none of their stuff. I was more into the Allman Brothers and the Doobie Brothers (pre and post Michael McDonald that is). That was where my head was at. SO - I finally got my first GD album - Europe 72,just a couple of weeks ago, on a recommendation - and to me, it is just this side of mediocre. What is the big deal? They sound like any number of C&W bands that roll into my town for the annual C&W Festival. I'm serious, this album is boring. It is the kind of stuff that we used to play in our sheds to warm up. Maybe Europe in 1972 wan't ready for the GD, but for me it is a snoozeathon. Sorry, but it bites the big one."
2,not heavy duty,was dissappointed by the fact that this is very thin wire and doesnt seem to be heavy duty. I hope it holds up but I have my doubts.
2,RESPIRATORY CARE EXAM REVIEW,"I wasn't to pleased with the book. I have read the book from cover to cover, numerous times and thought I knew all the info for the RRT exam. Well, I took the RRT exams and didn't pass either one. The majority of the highlighted material wasn't even covered on the exam. Further more, what was on the tests weren't really covered in depth in this book. For the cd- it was good because it was based on what the computerized test was really like. I felt confident when I was ready to take my tests but not pleased with the results. I also found of few flaws, like mispelled words, missing words on the cd??????? and very confusing ways to do the equations and ABG's."
4,Great birthday present.,"This is one amazing tool. The genius of the thing is it not only mashes potatoes, but it also mashes other things like carrots, squash, beets, and a lot of other things. This tool replaces a multitude of single use tools like carrot mashers. No other country could invent a product that is so beneficial to mankind, making the world a better place. This magnificent piece of engineering was later found to be predicted in Einstein's explanation of the curvature of time and space. The simplicity of the thing is simply amazing yet complex at the same time. Be sure to read, understand and follow all the instructions that come with this tool. Don't be fooled into thinking it is benign. I badly mashed my hand.I gave this four stars because it's instructions do not explicitly state to cook the vegetables prior to mashing. That's how I mashed my hand.Makes a good birthday present for your wife. Also, a good Bingo prize. Take my word on this."
1,Avoid!,"This is NOT, I repeat, NOT the stick grenade those dirty Germans used against us Good Ol Boys back during Dubya Dubya 2. This here is for actually mashing potatoes. I was the laughing stock at this year's Dubya Dubya 2 re-enactment. Luckily I had a fresh whole rabbit with me to distract my platoon as I hid the so-called ""potato masher"" under a large woman's dress."
3,Gift,Seems to have been well received. The selection came off of their wish list so I expected them to enjoy it and they did.
1,I'm FURIOUS!!!,Why doesn't the author just write a book about shop lifting or being a pickpocket? Being a locksmith is a time-honored profession that passes down professional skills from teacher to student. Lock picking is not a sport and should never be considered as one. If you want to be a locksmith-then go to school-but don't pick locks for fun. Books like these should be burned and the authors jailed.
5,Celestial,"I am so happy to find this record. The music is probably only four stars, but I gave it five because it features an instrument called 'the Celeste' It is a keyboard device, that plays bell-like metal tubes. Most people know it from the ""Nut Cracker"" ballet piece called Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairies. I have heard the celeste only on one other jazz recording, that one from another Chicago Blues piano man, Jimmie Yancey.After hearing this recording, I wonder why it has not been used more in small groups. I can only imagine what 'the Modern Jazz Quartet' could have sounded like with a Celeste sometimes rather than the Vibes.Lewis does hit some Yancey riffs once in a while on this one, but this is not a nostalgia record. Lewis is creating his own sound, contemporary to the time it was made. He was not frozen in amber, re-playing 30's honky tonk blues."
2,pretty dull,"The handles, although very cushioned, are TOO fat for my hands (which admittedly are rather small). I never really got to give either piece a true test though, because the blades on the parer and the vegetable peeler were way too dull to work well. I can't really recommend either, although the parer was a little better than the peeler."
5,best backjack book ever,"I have been collecting blackjack books for the past 25 years and this one is the best.Why? Beacause it introduces the simplest effective card counting system devised to date. The writing is clear , the instructions are precise and above all the system is simple relative to others.Absorbing the material will take time but you will be well rewarded if you succeed. If you progressto ""full"" matrix indices ,buy James Grosjean s book Beyond Counting and see if you want to lern soft doubling indices as well"
4,Excellent Blackjack book,"The best beginners blackjack book around. I found it not only presented a very workable system, but it explained it clearly and easily. The first chapters do an excellent job of explaining the ""history"" of blackjack, and the next chapters gradually add to the complexity of the count. My only complaint is that the ""full"" system with all the indices is not explained better. Otherwise, does an excellent job of explaining a very good system for counting cards that a beginner can handle and that many experts use."
4,Advantage,I really loved this book. It's a very easy system to learn and apply. As far as how effective it is. I have to say I expect to win every time I sit at a blackjack table with decent rules.
1,THE WORST SONG TO COME OUT OF SPAIN YET...,"I HAD TO LISTEN TO THIS NASTY LITTLE SONG ALL SUMMER LONG. I CAN'T BELIEVE THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY BUYING THIS MUSIC. IT IS AWFUL! TOTALMENTE INSOPORTABLE E HORROSO! SUPPOSEDLY IT WAS BASED ON RAPPER'S DELIGHT- AT LEAST YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT SUGARHILL GANG IS SAYING - I SPEAK SPANISH FLUENTLY, AND THIS IS A NO NONSENSE, BAD FLAMENCO-POP VERSION - YUCK. IF YOU WANT GOOD MUSIC FROM SPAIN, I RECOMMEND CARLOS MAGIC JEAN ""BACK TO THE EARTH"" (THE DABADA SONG - IT'S MUCH BETTER, BELIEVE ME), OR DAVID CIVERA. CHECK THESE PEOPLE OUT."
5,long lasting...,and though I wish it were a little stronger on the Patchouli scent (i tend to over do things so) I think the Manufacturers have the right balance. Will buy again.
4,flexible mounts,"These are great but underrated for weight -- if you need 6-10lb speaker buy the model 20. My advice is go to the next model higher than you think you need via Omnimout 5, 10, 20. ie double the weight of your speaker to get the correct Omnimount."
2,Fits buts needs modification,Not a drop-in replacement. Needed to cut a piece of plastic flange to get it to fit. Overall it works and matches the original.
5,Fast and perfect,"These were the same price as my local Freddies was selling a 25 pack of the slower 4x Sony -RW which they tried to tell me was the best but that's untrue. I've used 10 disks so far and all have worked perfectly and at 8x speed I can burn a full one in less than 10 minutes. For about $1 per disk these were a great buy and the plastic storage case is nice. If your DVD drive supports +RW these are the ones to get. +RW is better than -RW because it has faster speeds and drag and drop ability. Update Feb 14 2012 I've used every one in the pack to store everything from full disk ISO burns & DVD rips, with ISO burner free software takes about 8 minutes to burn a full 4.7 GB disk, to drag and drop video files in flash drive mode & they all worked fast & flawlessly, money well spent. As long as they keep functioning, I'll have enough to last for ever. DVD+RW is the best and these disks couldn't get any better."
5,Criminally Underappreciated Gem,"Salton got lost in a sea of tweaker films when it was released, but deserved a better fate -- especially Val Kilmer's gritty, affecting performance as a lost soul navigating the crystal netherworld. Vincent D'Onofrio's chillingly hilarious turn as a piggish crank kingpin is the stuff of which nightmares are made. Heisenberg would have approved."
4,sad story,Salton Sea is pretty raunchy but the underlying story is heartbreaking.Val Kilmer once again demonstrates his ability to convincingly get into any character he portrays. Its also a sad commentary on those who waste their lives in unreality.
3,It does not play in the ps3,"It took like 2 months to get, but is sealed and new so its ok! And it played ok on th dvd but not on the ps3"
1,um.. what a waste.,"don't waste your time and money on this film. val kilmer made this film sound like it was the only film worth watching this year. i'll just say you're not missing anything. what was a good story line was turned into mediocre ... it was even fragmented, ... bad directing, ... [the lead actor] was trying too hard to be something he wasn't. he isn't made for a role like this. ... ..."
4,Moody and disturbing,"This is the sort of film made to order for Val Kilmer who was able to shine amidst so many other talented actors. The story line went a little beyond believable but each character was brought to life by the execellent cast and although the pace wasn't fast and furious my attention was held by the intricate plot and I enjoyed how everything became perfectly understandable. Vincent D'Onofrio was thoroughly convincing and Deborah Unger set the mood. A film noir, very disturbing, great sets, perfectly acted."
2,"Great compilation, but...","I have to say the production quality is terrible. My high school mixed tapes were cleaner and higher fidelity than this album. During the song Lost In Motion - one of the more tranquil, moody tracks - there's a HUGE pop that totally ruins the mood of the song. You'd think if you were going to spend the time and money producing an album, you'd either get better vinyl, or fix the screw-ups in post. And I'm not just talking dust on a record, this is a huge pop like somebody put a fork to the record and plugged it into a high voltage outlet. Not what I expect from a professionally produced trance CD.Other than that, great compilation."
4,Execllent piece of track selection,well i like to say that ferry corsten is one of the most talented dj's in the world. BUT this is nothing. try Ministry of Sound Trance Nation 2001 it is superb. Muy Caliente! or actually Anything buy this dj is wonderfull.
2,This Isn't the Miles You Want,"By this point in his career, Davis was just mailing it in. The caliber of the musicianship is par excellence as always. The quality of the songs is what makes this CD a bore. Either Miles just didn't care any longer or he was totally burnt. Take your pick. Either way, these songs are unimaginative, repetitive and say absolutely nothing. Davis was no longer a musical trailblazer but a trend follower."
5,The Only Miles You NEED,"If this had been the first Miles Davis record I'd bought, I don't think I'd be satisfied with the rest by comparison. Miles is very careful about how much he plays here. He leaves so much room for his band to stretch out. And they go for it too. Marcus Miller is fabulous here. The disc worth the cost just to hear him. What is so enjoyable for me is to hear a young Mike Stern play some of the best and most thrilling guitar of his life. The tunes sound like jams based on simple melodies, but when the jams are this good, who cares?"
2,unrealistic,"This book has an interesting plot, but did not live up to my expectations. The main charachter, Marnie is not very likeable. She regards herself as superior to Raven, this does not give off the message that she loves him,but rather that she feels sorry for him and is being kind to him out of pity. I find this kind of unbalanced rlationship to be extremly irritating."
2,At least the cover was nice,"When I saw the cover and read the blurb, I thought I'd be in for a great read. But it did not take me long at all to get tired of Marnie being right all the time. She wins every theological argument with Father Brannan, she tames the wild beast that is Raven, and she deftly deals with the hateful townspeople of Torcurra. All this accomplished by a sixteen year old girl was somehow not inspiring, but rather annoying and unbelievable. I truly enjoy independent female characters, but if Marnie had smacked one of the villagers or at least thought about it, I would have found her easier much easier to relate to and like."
1,How sad that young adult literature is now on par with trash,To say I was diassapointed with this book is an understatement. It had real potential but instead chose to be a salacious story with no moral value at all. Girl is in an arranged marriage. Sex is a awful. Meets deaf boy. Sex is wonderful. The end.
5,Loved it!,"After reading the three previous books in this series (Lion's Lady, Guardian Angel, The Gift) Castles was probably the slowest in the beginning. It wasn't as fast paced as Guardian Angel and it wasn't as hilarious as The Gift but I rated it with 5 stars because of Colin! I believe he was the best man out of all the men(Lyon, Caine, and Nathan) in this series! Nathan, from The Gift, does a huge turn around in Castles!"
3,Not the worst book I've ever read...,"Maybe it's that I didn't read the two (or is it three?) books that came before this one in the series, but I just didn't enjoy Castles. I love Julie Garwood, so not liking this book won't stop me from reading more of her work, but it's hard to imagine how someone who can be write so well can sometimes just write so badly. Maybe this is one of the earlier novels. That might explain the fact that every action is meticulously detailed from start to finish. Princess flees convent for England. Princess's guardian falls ill. Princess must stay with guardian's son. Princess must get married. It was like reading one of those See Jane Run books, and I'm a bit too old for those now. The characters themselves were well developed and likeable despite the fact that the story was predictable and boring. Oh well. I still love Garwood, but I'm recommending The Bride and Honor's Splendour way before this one..."
5,"I LIKE, I LIKE...VERY MUCH..INDEED...",This is one of my favorite books. I own all of Garwood's books
3,Losing a bit of the magic!!,"I've read the other 2 books in this series, Guardian Angel and The gift, and i thought they were great, but this one, though good, isn't as captivating. Half way through i found myself thinking that the characters didn't interest me much, which was a shame cause i loved the glimpses we got of colin in the other books. i didn't like the additions at the ends of the chapters where we got the thoughts of the murderer, it was all so contrived and right from the time you met him you knew who it was. Keep it simple, please. But it was still pretty good, i don't think she can write a bad book."
4,not for cowards,"Yeah, ok, so I expected a romance, but because it's from J.G., I also expected a bit of suspense, mystery. HOWEVER, since I'm such a little fraidy-cat, I am still a little afraid that Morgan's going to come get me. His death was too graphic. And I read it in the dead of night so that I could finish it in one day.But overall though, I thought it was a pretty nice book. I didn't give it 5 stars because the threat of the general could have been explained a bit more, expanded upon. Also, there were a lot of minute details that were never resolved nor was an explanation supplied.The part where Colin finds something wrong in everyone one of the guys on her list and then how he traps her into marriage...MUCHO HILAIROUS! My brother thought I was crazy, I couldn't stop laughing.All in all, a good book to read and I would read it again, but I'd skip over a quite a bit of pages."
2,Not the best,"I was very disappointed by this novel. If I'd read it alone, maybe I would have liked it. But I read it as a continuation of the series. I was very upset that Nathan does not make an appearance until the end of the novel. I was also disturbed by the physical changes Garwood made in the other characters from previous novels. To me, it just isn't a sequel. Colin did not seem like himself. Even when viewing the book separate from the rest, the character of Alesandra is not fully fleshed out. Nor is the story believable. I didn't buy their romance for a minute. I can only recall a few memorable moments from this novel--one touching, one funny. This is definitely a novel to borrow but not to buy."
2,I don't know why everyone likes this so much...,"Honestly everyone calls this album refreshing but I just don't see it. Maybe the everyday topics make this album extremely relatable to some people, and I hear that, but honestly the only thing worthwhile on this album is the production. He can't ride the beats and his rhymes and wordplay aren't clever at all. In the end, I don't care about any of the things MURS raps about on this album.I'm glad he's doing his thing but this album is not that nice."
4,Marital Gift,The book makes a perfect little gift for those just married who WILL evolve into the couples depicted in the New Yorker cartoons. Hopefully the book offers them a sense of humor for the inevitible and thus helps them.In brief...a great marital aid for the nieve.
3,OXO Utility Knife,"This knife still has the comfort handle but the serrated edge requires a lot more ""sawing"" than my Oxo paring knives."
5,revealing,Somebody told me about the books that Platinum Millennium releases about the music business but i did not believe that person until i bought a copy. These titles are simply amazing and especially the yellow pages series. A great series that should be in your hands right now
5,helped me,"I never thought I could find such a good title out on the open market, my friends always told me that great writings are in limited numbers but i never thought that such a great piece of information can be found so easily. This title worked best for me beacause I am a man of actions, I keep my busines running fast and I need fast access to valuable information. Without this book i would of never succeded in developing so fast and good business relationships would of never developed."
4,Ptumayo does it again!,"Another nice collection by my world traveling companions at Putumayo! This offering travels all over the beautiful region showcasing the diverse talents and culture and rich history of this area. My only complaint is the brevity! Come on, Guys! Add another 3-4 tracks. We know there is lots of music out there. Liner notes are good, lyrics (and translations) would be better, but I don't want to nitpick. This is nice party music for this time of year and will be getting lots of play during our summer parties along with Putumayo's ""South Pacific Islands"" and ""Islands"" Keep up the good work! this c.d.and a cocktail;(may I suggest...) coconut rum and cranberry-tangerine juice. Enjoy! Summer's Comin' !!"
2,Disapdointing,"Interesting young actor Armie Hammer in a disappointing movie. It's a pity, it could be not just another movie."
1,Peaceful Ocean Surf,"Do not buy this CD to relax or sleep. Screeching gulls & fog horns override the sounds of ocean surf. Instead buy Echoes of Nature, Ocean Waves. This CD really works."
4,"Great for authentic beach in the day, not good for sleeping","This CD is not for sleeping. To repeat another review, it has some loud birds and fog horns that would wake you up. It is wonderful for when I just miss the beach so much I can't stand it and I can close my eyes and pretend I'm there."
2,"Useless, pointless woman overshawdows Iran","The main character inspires nothing but a mild distaste and unfortunately overshadows with her pointless little musings a much more interesting subject of a people on the verge of revolt. Chloe could have been written as a much more compelling sympathetic narrator through which to see a turning point in a life of a country. There is not enough wit or drama or lirerary cleverness to make one want to read beyond page 15, the only reason I did, is that I made it a rule to finish all books I start. Johnson has written much better books."
1,Will anything interesting ever happen here?,"I wanted this book because I thought it would describe INTERESTING events happening in the life of an American woman in a Middle Eastern country. Not quite. It merely threw a few week's boring events together to create a boring story that went nowhere. The story is called ""Persian Nights"", yet the reader wasn't informed about the culture, customs or traditions of this mysterious land! The few somewhat eyelifting parts (that would seem difficult for the author to solve)somehow were suddenly patched (Noosheen and the whole passport thing). There were so many parts that could have gone somewhere and never did. Awfully boring."
1,What a disaster!,"I watched the Klansman on my Kindle Fire. I was appalled to discover two first rate actors, Richard Burton and Lee Marvin, as the protagonists. I've seen ""disaster zone"" movies before and I must say that the Klansman makes the top five! The only reason to watch this movie is to see Burton-Marvin ""acting"" as part of a sentimental journey into the past... There's nothing else to recommend this complete failure."
1,Two Drunks and a Unconvicted Murderer,"I don't know who was more lubed, Marvin or Burton. Lola Falana is the victim of a really brutal gang rape, OJ Simpson is whacking people left and right. Not even bad enough to be funny. Hard to believe the same man who directed FROM RUSSIA WITH LOVE was involved. Save your money."
1,Caveat Emptor,"The DVD version of this film is a nightmare. When this movie was released I was the night projectionist is a grind house in downtown San Diego, California. It was so incredibly offensive that I immediately put it in my ""Cult Classic"" list. Imagine my horror upon watching the DVD. The sound track is perfectly horrible and the ""editing"" is nothing less than a hatchet job, to say nothing of being a close relative to book burning. The pitiful Pollyannas who did this have completely robbed the film of its impact. What kind of a world do these people think we're living in anyway? I strongly advise against buying the DVD in its current state."
3,snail mail,I recently made an error in judgement and should have gone the proper pathto see why it was taking so long to receive this book instead of losing my temperit was not the vendors fault.
5,Nicer Ricer,"Saw one of these on ""Nigella Bites"" - was intrigued and bought one. Makes the smoothest creamiest mashed potatoes with an absolute minimum of effort. Don't know how product could be better so 5 stars."
5,great little gadget!!,"It's only my husband and me, now that our girls are grown. I wanted something that would do the job, but in less time. This ricer is great. My husband often helps with the cooking and, he was was really impressed with this gizmo. It had great reviews and they were all right about it. It's heavy duty and really easy to use. It will get a good workout in my kitchen."
3,Bummer. It broke.,"Mine is 3-4 years old, I use it at Holidays, so no more than 5x per year. Today the shaft that presses the disk down and presses the potato through bent right up, making it no longer usable. Back here to shop for another one."
3,I'm Not Impressed,"When I used the ricer, I was very disappointed with the way the potatoes turned out. They were heavy and stiff (almost like you could remold them into whole potatoes) - the only good thing I can say is that there weren't any lumps. My family was disappointed as well. They were looking forward to the light, creamy and fluffy potatoes that I've been making for years.I've been trying to find other uses for the ricer, but haven't had any luck yet.On the plus side, it is sturdily made, and it cleans easily.It requires a little more effort than I had expected to compress the handles. If you have any problems with your hands, this is definitely not for you.Overall, it's a big disappointment and I wouldn't recommend it."
4,"Works well, but less ergonomic than other OXO products","I used this potato ricer to make gnocchi. It works well, but you have to make sure that the potatoes are very soft before you put them through (otherwise it will get clogged up). I found it a bit awkward to hold and use, especially compared to other OXO products, which are usually designed to be extremely ergonomic."
4,Works Great,"What can I say, it works. It's a simple device - and it does the job it's intended for :)Easier than ever to make mashed potatoes - just boil them in pieces that will fit (skin and all) and mash with the ricer."
4,ed knows almost everithing!,"Ask Ed is, yet, a excellent book. Ed Rosenthal is a famous writer about cannabis and related subjects, thast almost everyone knows. In this book, ""Ask Ed"", he write, in very simply mode, all the basics knowledge who ones need know about marijuana cultivation, specially for newbbies. All the basics are here, in simply but very helpfull text. Some informations are a little obsolete (Ed is from hippie generation...), but the book could vbe, yet, very helpful. For a new grower is a good source of knowledge and tips. Finishing: Ask Ed: if you are not an expert yet, this book is a good source."
4,inspiring story and life,"I found Peter Barton and his life inspirational. I liked his practical and unconventional viewpoint. For example, the way he described the Harvard MBAs as being sold to the highest bidders, like Arabian thoroughbreds, was amusing and true. (I also have an MBA.)I have read through the 38 reviews here and find it interesting that some people apparently read the book and think that Laurence Shames had cancer and died!! Sometimes I guess you wonder if people read the same book you did!"
5,Ida Remains Indestructible,"Ida Cox was one of the three top female blues singers in the '20's and '30's and was featured with other jazz greats at Carnegie Hall in 1939. This record, her last, was made in 1961 when Ida was 72. She died in 1967 at the age of 78. Her voice reflects her age and lack of practice since she had long since stopped performing when she agreed to do this recording. Backed up by stellar artists' Coleman Hawkins, Roy Eldridge, Jo Jones and Sammy Price, she still had much voice control and resonance with numbers she wrote, like Moanin', Groanin' Blues, Mean Papa, Turn in Your Key and others. For true blues buffs, this recording is a must for historical reasons if not for lyrical voice quality."
3,A Developmental Elliott Smith,"Either/Or is a stepping stone to XO. It's not Smith's most masterful work, nor is it his worst, albeit beautiful pieces such as ""Between The Bars,"" and ""Angeles"" help comprise the track list. I'm a big fan of Elliott's piano compositions, but you won't hear much keyboard on this record aside from a few subtle organs and such."
5,My favorite album of all time,"I listen to a lot of music, like most of you I am sure. While my top 10 is always changing this album finds a way to consistently stay on top of the pack. Heart on sleeve poetic lyrics, deceptively complex songwriting and immediate hooks fill each song. This along with Roman Candle and Nick Drake's Pink Moon always console me when I'm down. Elliott's sense of melody and harmony were so rich, and his voice was so soft yet extremely ""heavy"". He understood...Basically the Beatles in one guy, what else can I say?"
4,"Entranced, interested New Englander!","I bought this book a couple of weeks back at a local book store. I guess just the name of the book caught my eye, New England Ghost Stories. I'm from New England, so I wanted to check it out and so far I can't put the book down. I would love to read more of Hans Holzer's books in the near future. He's a great author."
2,its ok.........,"I give this book only a two star rate. This book is ok, the author I feel is a little repateivtive in his writting. He relies heavy on channeling with very little history if any to back things up. Its interesting and belevable but over all its not a book I would buy new, buy it used. Its still a good read but most of the stories are a bit old."
1,Self Promoting,"I bought this book hoping for stories of ghostly legends from New England. What I got was some guy who considers himself a ghost hunter that has a friend that supposedly can connect with the ghosts that haunt the places they visit.Reading this book was like watching a TV special, you know the kind, where the magician picks someone out from the audience and keeps on saying ""now I do not know you, nor have I ever met you"".I really wished I did not buy this book."
5,Easy and fun to read with exhilarating effects on your life,"I have a small library of psychology and analyse books as i study psychology as a hobby. I picked this book up in a bookstore and had to buy it. The information when you look deeper as the words are overwhelming. I changed my letters as instructed especially the A, S and L. The effect was amazing. When analysing people i suggested they change their handwriting, just here a letter of two that i knew corresponded with their problem and the effects was astonishing. I have finally got the courage to take dance lessons and now i am the one asking the ladies to dance, and yes i now write with a fountain pen. Thanks Vimala. Note it sounds easier than it acually is to change the way you write. As Vimala says. The harder it is to do the more the reward will be in the end."
5,"Powerful technology for every day , life-long use","Implementing Vimala Rodgers's handwriting changes from 'Your Handwriting Can Change Your Life!' is the most powerful tool that I know for self-improvement. Using handwriting changes is an accelerator for anything I've done since using the Vimala alphabet, from getting my nerve up to change careers, improving my eyesight naturally, raising my goals and improving personal relationships. Currently, I'm practicing the Epsilon e and r and the figure 8 g to aid me in creating my own book.This book is straightforward, non-threatening, lively and thorough. It covers the components of handwriting, has easy-to-follow instructions for each letter and most importantly to me, explains the personal application of each letter."
4,Shaun the Sheep and Christmas!,"This is a very cute collection of Shaun the Sheep holiday/winter episodes. While they are not all about Christmas, they definitely got my boys in the mood for the holidays and had them cracking up. In the Christmas episode both the famer and animals do good deeds for each other and its nice to see they care! Shaun the Sheep is great because it is a DVD that I don't mind watching with the kids as the humor is really for people of all ages! Wholesome lessons with mischief and laughter!"
4,We Wish Ewe a Merry Christmas,The packaging was secure and well done resulting delivery in perfect condition. The stories were hilarious and well done. Any parent would love their children to see Shaun the Sheep episodes.
4,"Seven more episodes, and a holiday theme","---------------------------------------------------------------------""Shawn The Sheep: We Wish Ewe A Merry Christmas""(Hit Entertainment, 2011)---------------------------------------------------------------------Another nice installment of this British kid's series, with seven new episodes including some seasonal good cheer... The opening Christmas episode is nice, a heartwarming cartoon in which the farm animals rally together to give the lonely farmer a happy Christmas; the other cartoons are fun as well, following the now-standard STS formula. An episode where baby Timmy's favorite toy gets trapped under a five-ton block of granite was particularly funny. If you like Shawn already, you'll enjoy this collection as well. Happy holidays! (DJ Joe Sixpack, ReadThatAgain childrens' media reviews)"
3,Window on an era,"First off, I hope the seller's name appears linked to this review because they totally misrepresented the condition. It was disgustingly spattered with gawd-knows-what which had to be removed with rubbing alcohol before I could touch it without getting queasy. The corners were dog-eared, actually folded inside for several pages and it had obviously been dropped.Fortunately this didn't affect the content which was a trippy visit to Bezerkeley during the era when the internet was just beginning, smart drugs, raves, Burroughs, Leary, hacking as a noble endeavor and ""that whole scene."" It's also amusing to compare the predictions in various articles with the reality today."
5,Twin Ties So Aptly Put,"I couldn't help but be pulled into the story of a TWIN relationship explored on this delicate subject. Bette did such a complete job of portraying the close ties of connection between twins and yet also the strain that's created when major decisions about marriage and family values have to be ""excused"" within that relationship and within a family. I am a twin myself and am presently in the grieving process at living without my womb-mate. Bette's words I believe helped heal my hurt and encourage my recognition that sickness and loss are a part of life. But with a family's comforting ties one's review of life can be less painful. Faith in God truly brings a spiritual strength you don't know you have until the difficult times. Just reading of the twins' cycle of faith added real hope and grace into my situation. Thanks, Bette, for another challenging, practical, grace-producing approach to living day-to-day in our world. Please keep writing on the ""edge-y"" issues of life!"
2,Great Home Gym Handbook,I was really disappointed with this book for the price. It was just a small book and I thought the price for what you got was too high.
3,Good with a major flaw,This devise cores and divides apples with no problem but it is a pain to clean. Where the metal folds over itself in several places there is a gap that collects bits of apple. Cleaning it with a toothpick every time I use it is a pain. Flushing it under the tap doesn't do it.
5,The origional,Sometimes things just work and this does just that. Use it and throw it in the dishwasher. Great for making apple cake
