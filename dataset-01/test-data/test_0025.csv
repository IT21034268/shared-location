4,violet's review,"I really like this movie. I love the little boy--he is really good. I saw him in something else, (Jack Bear?) and he was really good also. Anyway, this is a pretty good action movie. Well I like it anyway. You will like it too. I love that kid!"
1,another boring movie,The director has wasted an interesting story and the film is simply boring. Everything is expected. Not worth for wasting your time to watch it.
5,Great Value,This was a great value and great condition. I was very pleased with the purchase of this very satisfying product
3,LOW BLOOD PRESSURE,"Bruce Willis returns in the role of a loose cannon, demoted by the FBI after a hostage situation goes tragically awry. Willis is great in these kind of roles, eliciting both a strong macho appearance, but with an inner sensitivity that evades other actors. Willis' scenes with Miko Hughes as the autistic Simon are the highlights of the film, as is the supporting performances by Chi McBride as Willis' buddy and Kim Dickens as a young lady who gets involved in the situation. Alec Baldwin is smarmy again as the villainous NSA director. The main problem I found with this picture is director Harold Becker's meandering pacing and inability to maintain a tight level of suspense. The climax is great, but wading through some really slow scenes hurts it overall.Not a great film, but a good one."
3,Deja vu,"Yeah, it's an OK film, but there's nothing new in it at all. Willis plays the role of a gritty, tough cop who wins out in the end. Die Hard? I just felt as though I was watching a movie that I'd seen before, and that we the first time I saw it. Brucie is getting a bit long in the tooth for all this too. He threw off his role as a perpetual 13 year old to become a manic depressive - well, at least, that's thae way he looks in all his recent movies. The smile has gone! Easy watching but not worth buying. Wish I hadn't!"
1,DIFFERENT THAN PICTURED!!!!,"I purchased this lunchbox under the impression that THIS would be the one that was sent. My daughter picked it out herself for her first day of Kindergarten. Luckily, she is ok with the one that was sent (as it is still a Barbie themed one). We don't have time to run around and shop for a new one locally as she is starting school in another 2 days. Seriously though, you should be able to get what is pictured! It's not like it says ""random selection"" or something like that. Ridiculous. Amazon needs to consider all sellers that they are using, because this has happened far to many times in the years I've been purchasing from them."
3,No Thermos in lunch box.,"I liked the quality of the lunch box...but thought it came with a thermos, and it didn't so what is the point!"
5,Classic romantic comedy,"This movie is one of our favorites, and we have watched it dozens of times over the years. Although the story line takes place during World War II, this is definitely NOT a war movie! Rather, Cary Grant and Leslie Caron are complete opposites who meet on an enemy plane-watching Pacific island and what follows is just plain funny. Trevor Howard is also great in this movie, his banter with and tricks on Cary Grant are dry humor at its best. Throw in a bunch of diplomatic school girls, an enemy excursion to the island, and the final denoument, and you have all the makings of a great movie. Get ready to meet ""Goody-Two Shoes and the Filthy Beast""! This movie is a true classic and will never get old."
4,Great Old Movies,Looking for a movie with a hint of danger but loads of comedy that your entire family can watch? This should be on your evening's agenda!
5,"Father Goose, My kind of movie",This is such a fun movie. Cary Grant is a plays a charactor so totally different from the ones we usually watch him play. He is great!!Leslie Caron does really well and they do a good job of helping you to see past them and see their charactor.Quite enjoyed each and every individual. My friend watched it 13 times in the first week!
5,I agree - the picture is fine,"Yes, the image is ""matted"" / letterbox, but my DVD player fits it to my 16:9 TV screen, and the image is quite viewable. I'm quite happy with it."
2,Overhyped Album not the sum of its parts,"I was eagerly awaiting this album and frankly I'm disappointed. Don't expect the rest of the album to compare to the two great singles already released, Rapper's Delight & Full Cooperation. The CD is only 50 minutes in length, and probably 10-15 minutes of that is skits, talking, etc. Keith Murray gives us his worst rhymes to date and Sermon's production meanders all over the place from good to terrible. It feels like the album was quickly put together to meet the release date. Overall get it for the two singles but stay away if you don't like them"
1,Getting Old Drunk & Borring...,"Well I was A big fan of these guys, but all I see (and hear) is a borring prefomance of one of the best rock groups of the 90`s. And here I said it.. there is no more thrill nothing to put a smaile on my face, We lost a corner - stone band in the history of rock&roll."
4,"Great music and content, VHS video quality","Hey awesome PJ music, no doubt. But the video is surprisingly low quality for a DVD, lots of video noise, digital artifacts and halos. Cops on my cable channel looks better. So minus 1 star. Buy it anyway. See Sarah Mclaughlin's Mirrorball for 5 star video reference."
1,Very Dissapointing,"In Pearl Jams first years, they were an energetic band live on stage, and rather impressive to watch too.I thought this DVD would be alot better than it was, but when I think about it this DVD is quite awful.The setlist is the only thing good about it, if only it had been performed better, things might have been alright!Eddie Vedder(The Singer) sounds terrible and the music is performed badly too.One reviewer suggested them rehearsing and I can only agree!Alot of Pearl Jam songs of Yield and No Code are expermimental and kind of ruin what should be a solid setlist, thats not to say that No Code and Yield are bad albums, no way.And Binurals songs are good but sound kind of misrable and boring too, which is a real shame.Don't buy it, if you want a good music DVD get U2 ""Go Home "" or the Foo Fighters DVD."
3,A cheap review booklet,"This glorified pamphlet does a cursory job of reviewing the benefits of H2O2 and O3. There are some references here that are useful, so buy this if you want to see the reference section. I highly recommend William Douglass' Hydrogen Peroxide Medical Miracle instead of this book. Buy this if you are researching and are looking for good sources, though."
1,Way Overpriced by over two and a half times value.,"I received my copy of this book today..its more of a small phamplet 36 pages in length than a book. No wonder the Table of Contents has not been included to be seen!!..giving the impression this is a real book and not a simple phamplet. On the back it is printed""Vital Health Publications, West Allis, WI $3.95.""Being charged $9.95 (almost 4 times the price listed)on Amazon was disappointing enough, however in addition, there was a sticker on the back cover stating ""Now $122.00"".I guess this is to give the consumer the idea that they really got a good deal of paying only $9.95 for a $122.00 phamplet (that the price is only $3.95!!!) I definitely would NOT recommend this phamplet for what you get for the price...its a sham in my opinion. Id suggest you look for other books on ozone and hydrogen peroxide."
1,NO QUALITY SOUND,"At first I've got carried away with all the big stars that appear in this album, I bought it and when I got home the first thing I did was to hear it....what a disgrace!I can't believe such a miserable sound quality, besides practically there is no orchestration, this is an air recording from 1945, do not waiste your money!P.D: IF I COULD I WOULDED GIVEN IT 1/25 OF A STAR RATE."
1,Picture Quality Poor,"I've used several digital point and clicks... I've also use an Olympus C5050. I've been wanting to upgrade to a Digital SLR and believed the great reviews. I've been terribly disappointed with the pictures... all seem far to dark and dull. Doesn't seem to mater which lens or what type of lighting. I'm checking with Canon to see if maybe there is a problem with the camera... if not, I would say this is an awful investment. If you have time to work in the advanced modes, maybe you can find a setting that takes clear, crisp picture; but if you are using in any of the basic modes, you have no control over the results."
5,Flash exposure,"My first 20d had a problem with flash exposure in auto mode. I returned camera and the replacement worked fine in auto mode. (with flash) Good for that quick picture, and helps out greatly while I'm learning all the many features. The lens for me was great for that extra $100. Later I can get the 17 to 85. Also I must add, after learning how to use the built in flash, it does everything I want it to. Very happy with my purchase."
5,IT'S FUNNIER THAN THE SMURFS!!,"Douglas Adams sure knows how to make you laugh. With this book its just one adventure after another and pretty soon you start to become Arthur Dent yourself! You know which way to go, but of course you know which way Adams makes Arthur go and the conclusion to it is something pulled out of everyday life and put into a pickle jar(its that funny).Douglas Adams is one of those authors who plays with your mind and makes you think things and makes you see things. He paints such vivid pictures its amazing.While reading his other books in the series he always finds a way to bring in an inside joke that you'd only know if you've read the previous book.So hold onto your hats, cause you're in for a while ride when you read this one!"
5,Zacs Review of hitchhikers guide,"When books are made into movies that means, the book is first-rate. The Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy is no exception. The Hitchhikers Guide starts as Arthur Dent is saved from the destruction of earth by his alien friend posing as an out of work actor. The book really takes off when they are picked up by the president of the galaxy, Zaphod Beeblebrox. The main idea of the story is to find the ultimate answer to the ultimate question. The book does not really have a solid theme that can be identified, it is mostly random facts from the guide that ties into the story, and sometimes not at all. For science fiction fans/Monty Python fans this book is a must read, it is witty and interesting. The only downside of the book is that it is too short but luckily Douglas Adams wrote a series of Hitchhiker books."
4,Deliciously Entertaining!,"This book is pure fun! It's a great trip. The only problem I had was that at the beginning of the book I kept trying to follow and understand every little detail...which is difficult (if not impossible!). I read the first few pages over and over again trying to figure out what the heck was going on; it was very confusing. For people who are very detail-oriented and get frustrated easily, this is not the book for you. But, if you allow yourself to get lost in Adam's world you will throughly enjoy The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy."
5,Classic book for many generations to come,This is a true classic of science fiction it will remain one of the best for generations to come. Besides the strange plot about a man who is taken from the earth seconds before it is destroyed to built a intergalatic highway. By his friend from another planet in another universe (betleguse) and then searching for a planet that makes other planets (one of them being earth) and then going to the cafe at the end of the universe. It really is the end as in the big collapse. There are also great charectors. Which i cant get into because this review is getting too long already
3,HHGTTG,This book is about a guy who goes with his frend on a journy into space and try to be saved. The reason they want to be saved is because they find out they are on the enemys ship. I can't tell you any more because then I would give the book away.
4,Read My Review,"Well actually,i read the first 3 books in the serias about 2 years ago and i really don't remember that much,but i remember the names and the events,and i must say i laughed alot from this one and the other two after him,the serias is a funny Sci-Fi,the people who will enjoy it very much is a people with alot of humor,and Sci-Fi fans that don't really like all the drama Sci-Fi with all the understandable science facts,that is what this book is all about.it has a funny plot,characters and events all over it. the reason i only gave it 4 stars is because it's too damn short! i'm used to read books with 300-600 pages! what i'm gonne do now is buy the whole serias (i already got the second one and the third),and read it in a raw like a one book,maybe u should try it!"
3,You'll Laugh,"I liked this book -- maybe not as much as I thought I would, but still not bad. It felt like a book your strange friend from high school wrote -- the kid on the stage crew who would never miss an episode of Star Trek and who was designing web pages before most people had e-mail. The funny thing is that Hitchhiker's Guide was one of the first of its kind and had many imitators (like my strange friend).I was actually belly-laughing at some parts -- Adams is very good with humor. How else could you laugh at a book that begins with the needless destruction of planet Earth?!?For all super-intelligent shades of the color blue out there, this book's for you."
2,at least it's short,"Because it makes so many ""best of"" SF lists, I read it. I actually got a bit more than I expected - Adams's writing is quite good, and I picked up on a number of modern cultural references derived from the book - but as far as humor goes it's a zero. Obviously I'm in the minority, but keep in mind thatThe Facts of Life: Season Fourgets a higher average rating by Amazon customers, so there's your yardstick."
2,When a good idea goes bad...,"This is one that I will likely take grief for, but I can't help it - I did not like it at all. I love the concept ofThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, Deluxe 25th Anniversary Edition- quirky end-of-the-world-ness, random characters, coolly bizarre sci-fi bent. But the writing bored me, the characters were either whiny or self-indulgent or caricatures, and the ""plot"" felt flimsy. How on earth this became a cult classic with sequels is utterly beyond me..."
5,The greatest sci-fi book ever!,"Even though I first read the Finnish version of this book, and afterward English, it is the greatest sci-fi book ever written. Even the races that live in it are made with great sense of humor."
5,This is a great book both on earth and off it!!,"It all started off so innocently when Arthur Dent woke up that Thursday morning in his home near London, England. everything seemed so ordinary, and then, the earth blew up. The same thing happned to me when I read this book. At first, when I picked it up, I wasn't sure that I would like it. As the book progressed farther and farther on, the better it got. And although I am not usually a fan of science fiction, I could barely put Down The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. This book was funny, clever, and had some really memorable characters such as Trillian, Zaphod Beeblebrox, and Ford Prefect. I personally liked when they met Benjy and Frankie Mouse and how mice were said to be the smartest creatures on earth. I also thought it was a great idea of the author to use passages from the supposed original copy of this book. A must read. Don't forget to bring your towel!!"
5,"IF YOU'RE SMART, THIS IS THE BEST BOOK YOU'LL EVER READ!","Why are you reading this? If you even know the title it was probably recommended by a friend. I'm writing this for those very few who come across it by chance.If you think smart, funny, and cool are not mutually exclusive, everyone you know has already read this book. Any one of them will tell you it is the best book they've ever read. Hell, I don't even know you and I'm telling you that.Imagine Monty Python meets Star Trek. Imagine The Iliad meets Dilbert. Imagine The Naked Gun meets The Oxford English Dictionary.Well, maybe not that last one, but Adam's incredible literary wit will seriously make you laugh out loud. Loudly. Repeatedly. Every time you read it, from the very first page. Many people think it should replace the Bible as the defining work of Western civilization.Well, what are you waiting for?<BR"
2,Hitchhicker's Guide To The Galaxy,I really did not not the book Hitchhicker's Guide To The Galaxy.I was a book that did not interest me. Alot of the book made no sense to me. I really did not care about the Greatest computer or the time it toke them to get a stupid answer. I just really want to know what happens and how does it happen. The only reason why i gave it 2 stars is because it was a little funny but overall it is a bad book and i will not recommand it to anyone.
2,"Really, did I just read this book again?","Finally read it again after 10 years to see if my impressions had at all changed. They haven't. Utter nonsensical, drunken silliness. Come on - Adams could not have possibly had any idea where this book was going from the moment he typed his first word. There is no cohesion, no destination and (almost) no point - unless the point is that extra-terrestrial life would be as brainless and stupid as Earthlings are."
3,Overrated,"This book is very very funny, I will give it that much. It had me laughing out loud almost the entire way through. Adams has a very droll, dry sense of humor, and a great feel for the outlandish. But I was expecting so much more from this book than merely bringing the funny. It was on one 100 Greatest Books of the 20th Century list. The story is OK, but nothing groundbreaking, aliens and earthlings adventuring through space. And as for climax...this book ends so suddenly, I wasn't even sure what the whole point was. Nothing was tied up or remedied. Characters didn't change or evolve, more than a few questions went completely unanswered. I guess this book is part of a series. It's best feature...it's short, so I didn't waste much time, and now I can say I've read it, for whatever that's worth. I am sure there is some great sociological theme somewhere in this book, but I can't be bothered.3 stars for the laugh factor."
5,And I laughed...,"...and laughed and laughed and laughed, and above all, revised my view of comics. They are funny!"
3,A Decent Read...,"Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy is a funny book, but plan on reading the rest of the so called ""trilogy"" to get any real entertainment. There's just not enough in one book to make it satisfying.After reading Hitchhiker, I was left wanting more. Not because its a bad book, quite the contrary. Its just that it is so...short. This is not a book that was first written to stand alone so you need to be sure to have all the sequels on hand when you start as it is a short read as well.Overall, people who enjoy Monty-Python type hi-jinks will enjoy this. People who do not like slapstick-type comedy, will not."
5,Absolutely Hilarious,"This book is non-stop laughs from beginning to end. The extent of the ""fiction"" is so outrageous that you can't help but laugh. Very highly recommended to any reader with a vivid imagination."
3,"Good, but not that good!","This is another one of those books that is touted as a must read sci-fi classic (like Dune or Foundation). Invariably those books never live up to my expectations. Although I did like the Monty Python British type humor, the story wasn't that great or well written. Sorry, but I've read better (and funnier). The story ends abruptly without tying up loose ends, so I wouldn't consider this a complete story by itself. If anything buy the Ultimate Hitchhiker's Guide and read all the books as one novel. If you're looking for a bit of light reading away from all of the serious sci-fi novels and you don't have anything else to read, then give this a look."
5,Doesn't get soggy. even in milk!,"This book rules. You might not like it if you want *gasp* serious sci-fi reading, but if you like funny stuff then this is what you want. Anybody who gave this less than 4 stars has no sense of humour."
5,a very silly book,"Ever a fan of the late great Douglas Adams, I would like to add along with my fellow reviewers who gave this novel 5 stars that it is one of the more imaginative stories ever thought out, and indeed one of the oddest. It is quite hilarious and Mr. Adams was one of the few science fiction writers who could insert some real-life humor into his work. While you read about Arthur Dent whizzing around space in a most improbable ship, his experiences and feelings are instantly recognizable.Perhaps some people don't get it. It's on many schools' summer reading lists and kids might be expecting Homer or Shakespeare instead of some good laughs. But the laughs certainly aren't at the expense of your intellect. These aren't stupid jokes. Perhaps that's why not everybody gets them."
3,"Great book, terrible formatting","I absolutely love the book, the writing, the humor and the story. If you are buying this in Kindle format, beware: the formatting was done from a previous electronic copy of the book and wasn't proofread before they sold it on Amazon, so there are words without spaces between them and hyphenated words that at@one time split lines but no longer do. Still readable, but pretty irritating, especially for a book that you are paying the equivilant of a new paperback for..."
2,uggh,"The book The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy was a very good book. It describes many things in life. Some are adventure, and excitement. It describes four friends and how they survive in the galaxy.After Earth is destroyed to become an intergalactic highway, Arthur Dent, and Ford Prefect make their way into the galaxy. They meet up with Zaphod Beeblebrox, Ford's childhood friend, and Trillian, Zaphod's girlfriend. The four enter an abandoned planet. On the planet they encounter many hardships, and they must use all of their wits if they want to survive"
1,this book is a star trek wanna be,"THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE. WE DON'T RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE. IF YOU WANT TO READ A REALLY GOOD BOOK, THIS ISN'T IT."
2,Poor excuse for Sci Fi,"I read this book because Amazon reccomended it as similar to Battlefield Earth by L.Ron Hubbard, probably my favorite book of all time. Hitchhiker did not even come close. I am a Monty Python fan, and oh yes...I get it. This book however had no real story, and reminded me of some sort of silly narration of a story about a book that the narrator never bothered to read, making stuff up as he went along. No wonder it is so popular with the Junior High crowd. Two stars because I actually did laugh at one line when all dolphins departed the Earth...other than that, pure stupidness. I can't believe they concocted a movie from this...I won't be viewing that, I can tell you."
5,What a rush!,"Pack your bags! This is first and greatest book in the hittichicker trilogy (5 books)! Join the Zanniest bunch since Monty Python on there first and most confused expedition. This hillarious story of towels, hippies, Big yellow ships, and tiny little mice. Compells the reader to go and laugh you trought up! Da Bomb =B-) P.S. 42"
5,One of the top 5 books ever,"This book has everything, anyone who thinks otherwise is a freak or a nutcase."
4,Didn't Know What To Expect,"I heard a lot about this book, though I never exactly knew what it was all about. After reading it, I am very satisfied. It contains a mix of humour and science fiction that I haven't encountered in past novels. It brought up several theories that made me think, including the impossible being the possible. This is a very entertaining book and easy to read. The plot is very easy to follow and the author wrote it in such a way that it is easy for an average joe to understand what is happening in the story."
4,Love It,"One of my all time favorites, fast funny and original. I miss the prolog in the kindle edition I bought but you just can't go wrong here if want something a bit irreverant."
4,The Hitch-hikers(hard to understand at times)guide,"I have read all five of that trilogy. I have to say that the book was hard to understand in places but was very well thought of. It's too bad Douglas Adams has been taken from us but he left an interesting and funny series as far as The Hitchhikers guide to the Galaxy. Now one question remains. Can anyone explain where ""42"" came from and not ""28"" or ""17""?. Oh yeah,after I read it I lost it in storage. I guess I'm [between a rock and hard place] if the world ends...lol"
5,my favorite book,For a deeper and more perverse reader. I would say it is a more erratic humor with many crazy tangents that all lead up to something. I just randomly picked up the book and read it and wanted more. I read the entire series and all of Douglas Adams other books. A brilliant writer that captures my own thought sequence on paper. Very good book for people who enjoy funky reading!
5,Marvelous Spoof of the Universe in General,"This book should be required reading for anyone who thinks they know it all. It shows us that our quest for wisdom in the Universe is ultimately futile, but not depressingly. In fact, this is maybe the most enjoyable book you'll ever read. All the characters are intensely likable, even Marvin the depressed android, who in a lesser writer's hands would be simply anoyying. In fact, Marvin is my favorite character. The jokes and plot are all laugh-out-loud funny. Read it. Don't panic and remember your towel!"
2,Anne?,I did not like this movie.I thought it was too mushy and Anne was too romantic. I thought Diana was a sissy and Mathew and Marilla were stupid ( esspecially Marilla.
2,"Great movie, but poor quality dvd","I love the Anne of Green Gables movies, but for the PRICE I just paid for this movie, the DVD was not entirely worth it!!!! I have a problem with the sloppy packaging, no inserts, nothing but a 2 sided DVD. And the DVD does not contain CHAPTERS, so you can't just skip to different scenes like you can with most any other DVD. That seems like necessary feature for such a lengthy move, don't you think? Like I said, love the movie, just disappointed in the dvd version."
2,Poor video and audio quality for a dvd!,"I adore the movie, don't get me wrong, but I was fooled like many others into wanting to replace my vhs sets for dvd. I am very disappointed in the grainy images and mediocre sound quality of this dvd. It seems like Sullivan just slapped the movie on a disk, added the interactive menu and a few deleted scenes and began selling it. For this price tag, I would not advise replacing your vhs copies of this movie. If you have never bought the series before, see if you can find a discounted price or buy it used. This dvd is NOT worth full price!The movie itself is 5 stars, but the quality is 2 (and that is being generous!)"
5,A classic!,"I used to watch this on our PBS affiliate, and I've always thought of it as the Canadian answer to those wonderful BBC programs PBS brings us, such as Upstairs Downstairs, Duchess of Duke Street, the Edwardians, and the Masterpiece Theater specials. It certainly is of that caliber. The performances are excellent and well-cast. Anne is a very relatible character whom you root for from beginning to end."
4,Great Green Gables DVD!,"While reviews of the other version of this DVD were lacking to say the least, I very much enjoyed THIS seemingly superior Import Version of Anne of Green Gables. The quality is good, the colors very bright (if sometimes rather red... or maybe that's just my parents' TV set!) and the extra features are great. I love production shots and behind the scenes features, and while this DVD is lacking in more of the latter, the ""lost scenes"" and ""deleted scenes"" are good to see.One down-er and this is why I didn't give it 5 stars: this is NOT widescreen or letterbox!It has all the pluses of a DVD: chapter searches, but no scene selection. Digital remaster, but no widescreen.So, it's an improvement on tapes, but only a little.Otherwise, it's great and I'd recommend it. Probably at a lesser price, though! =)"
2,Anne of the Green Gables: The Collection,"On October 28, 2006, I wrote, ""I am so disappointed that it did not have any closed caption or subtitle for the deaf. I had to return it."" I had to put 2.0 on this item.BUT I'm so pleased that Anne of Green Gables: The Collection now has closed caption. Let me tell you why. I loved to watch Anne of Green Gables from videotapes. All of them had closed caption. So I expected these DVDs (individually not the collection) would have the closed caption but it did not have any (subtitles or closed caption). I was so disappointed because I am deaf and these movies had a lot of talking. Finally, my friend showed me this (The Collection) instead of individual DVD. I was so thrilled that it had closed caption. That's why I bought Anne of Green Gables: The Collection. Unfortunally, I cannot change the rate from 2.0 to 5.0."
1,HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!,"Very disappointed! The first side was fine, except for a couple pixely blips. After flipping to the second side, it wasn't long before the stutter-stop freezing began, and ultimately a complete freeze. The disk soon became unviewable. Then I learned that Amazon will refund only 50 percent because the package was opened! My wife says next time get it on Ebay. We had the same problem with a DvD. The Ebay vendor sent a replacement that worked fine, and we were not even asked to return the defective one!"
1,THIS IS NOT REALLY A KIDS MOVIE!,"Watched this movie with my 6 and 10 year olds. We had to turn it off. First, Howie Mandel's character is annoying, like he has ADHD. Second, there are curse words that are totally inappropriate for kids, like the monster pulls down Fred Savages pants and a girl monster says ""nice a$$"", that's just one of several examples.Third, and most important, the whole movie has a weird and unsettling feeling to it. But during the climax, when the little kid, who is about 5, is strapped to the wall, with darts thrown at his head, the main monster pulls his face off, exposing his slimy face with his bloody eyeballs hanging out, it was time for me to hit the stop button. My kids were relieved to have it over.It's a bad 80's, albeit very mild in comparison, horror movie. Adults will find it corny and obnoxious, and kids will find it bizzare and frightening, the stuff that nightmares are made of. In short, just awful."
3,Good Family Viewing.,"It is family friendly. The story is about the monsters under the bed. It is well done and acted, but it is somehow gloomy. In particular the inhabitants and scenery in the realm bellow, under the bed."
3,lil disapointed,the movie was great great quality but i ordered my package and selected 2-3 days and it took almost a week n a half to recieve my package i was going to give it as a gift and had to go and get something else....not very happy about that
3,Don't bother,"Like many 80's movies, this one isn't very good. Lots of profanity from both adults and kids, a young boy ogling at a woman in a skimpy bikini, and a main character swapping apple juice for pee in a boy's lunch turned me off of this movie. If the crude content was removed, I likely would have given the movie 4 stars. It's funny and imaginative, while still letting viewers glimpse life from a child's eyes when parents don't get along.Recommended: The Little Vampire"
5,awesome movie,"This is a movie I enjoyed as a kid, and am thrilled that now my own children enjoy it just as much! :)"
4,Little monsters with fred savage,"My kids loved this movie when they were little. Gives them someone to blame for the things that got broken in the house. Its a very fun albeit a little scary, movie with a fine moral message of it you hang with people doing bad things you are effectually one of the bad people"
5,"In praise of ""Shattered Lives""","I have known author Paulette ErkenBrack for more than 20 years. Her work as an Activity Director in several facilities and her skill as a writer have given her the tools she needed to share Ellen's story of dealing with dementia. Last year, when I personally faced my elderly father's change in personality, his anger and hostility towards his family, Paulette's experience and wisdom helped me to realize these changes were beyond his control. Education, knowledge of the physical and emotional changes that dementia brings is vital in living through this time.

3,Great but not that great,I love the taste of this protein powder. Mixes well. The downside is the price. I bought this for $31 in March of this year and now it's 10 dollars more. I'm going to look somewhere else.
3,Great product rotten price!,I love this protein powder! I am required to drink at least one protein supplement a day because of my medical issues. This tastes alot like lowfat chocolate milk and isn't gritty at all. BUT this price is outragoues! I ordered from another vender a container this very week of the same flavor and size for $29.99! Check around before you buy! WLS sites are great for high protein low carb mixes and powders as well as ready to drink protein. In my opinion Champion is the best but I can't give this product here a 5 star when I know it is over priced compared to other venders.
2,Who wrote this garbage? Who's directing it?,"Season One was great. Good idea. Good actors. Season two was written by someone who thinks the more words coming out of the actors' mouths, the better. Talk about rapid patter!!! It's very hard to understand what is said. And most of it is totally incidental to the action. I will not buy season 4 if season 3 continues this."
2,overated,I found this movie to be overated and contrived. It seemed to be trying really hard to be cool and ended up falling on its face. The violence wasnt funny apart from the stoned chick with the big machine gun. None of the characters were developed enough - If you're unfamiliar with the London accents and slang you may find this a great novelty if not the acting comes across as stereotypical and staid - sorry guys! Having said all this my flatmate reckons its one of the best movies ever made - oh well!
2,"Lock, Stock and Two Stars","This movie was advertized as a comedy. Sorry to say, I don't think so. English do have a different sense of humor than Americans but they do make funny movies. In ""Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels"" you may find an occasional chuckle or two but deffinately not funny. I fail to see humor in drugs, guns, organized crime, psychotic behavior and bloodshed. I was disappointed in the lack of humor...this is not a comedy for someone really wanting a good laugh."
5,The Best,"To be honest, my initial reason for watching this movie was that Jason Statham is in it, and he's one of my favorite actors (not to mention a hottie). But I won't get into that here.However, as I began to watch this movie, I realized that even if Jason wasn't in it I'd love it. As an adolescent, it's not often that I get to watch movies with humor like this. And perhaps movie-makers think that our young minds can't handle plot twists, because the movies that the rest of my generation is interested in don't come anywhere close to having plot twists like Lock, Stock. But I loved this movie, I really did. It actually had me cracking up, and few movies can do that.I definitely recommend that people watch this, and I think it can appeal to a wide variety of audiences. After all, my favorite movie next to this one is Pride & Prejudice."
4,I wish there were more movies like this.,"This is a great film. Wonderful actors spewing genius dialogue. Guy Richie has his own style and displays it perfectly in this film as well as snatch. If he stuck to this formula the way Tarantino sticks to his every film he made would be a sucess. The film has everything you want in a film, clever writing great acting and interesting and unique camera angles. There are parts that are impossible to understand but that makes it that much more enjoyable and makes you want to watch it again and again. The special features include a dictonary of sorts that helps you better understand what some of the actors are saying, its a pretty neat little feature and about the only one worth mentioning on the dvd. If you havent seen this movie dont wait, its very good and wonderfully unique."
5,Absolutely <EXPLETIVE DELETED> Tops!!!!!,This film is I am tempted to say the best movie I have ever seen. I was completely blown away by the photography and the story line with all of its glorious subplots was very engaging and it kept me guessing. Why is it that when the British remake American movies (in this case Pulp Fiction or Reservior Dogs) they always do it so much better?
4,"Fun, Bold Entertainment","""Lock Stock"" was a really cool witty action film. At first, I honestly didn't think that I would like it, seeing that I really hate british films but this one was different. It had style and class that most films in both America and Europe lack. And the soundtrack to this film is simply unbelievable! The only thing that I found trouble with is the actor's accent. You just might have to put it on caption. I now have a high anticipation on what Guy Ritche's next film.Overall, ""Lock Stock"" is a reccomended film that should be viewed more than once."
2,Very Grainy,"Not worth the price on Blu Ray, very grainy. Buy the DVD, quality is the same and it is CHEAPER! This Blu Ray should be offered always on a BARGAIN price due to picture quality. The movie otherwise is great, sometimes even better than the Tarrantino films on this genre."
5,"Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels",This is one of my favorite movies. I saw it I was on a plane and kept attracting quizzical looks from the other passengers every time I laughed out loud. Even after many viewings I am still laughing out loud.
3,great movie for british humor,"This is a funny movie, but, a bit to black-humor for my taste. I do recommend it tho."
4,3 stars out of 4,"The Bottom Line:American audiences may have trouble with the thick accents, but this movie is a treat; though I think it's a little less accomplished than Snatch, it's still clever and funny (with a great ending) and showcases Ritchie at the top of his form."
1,Unbelievably Bad,"I've heard so many great things about Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels ranging from its similar to the ""Boondock Saints"" and ""Snatch"" - both movies I really enjoyed. However, what you get is completely different. A dried-out, weak rendition of the Pulp Fiction-style movie where there are too many people to keep track of. The movie is confusing, the dialogue is difficult to understand, and there are too many coincidences to even think that this movie is relatively realistic. Unfortunately the movie just forgot to do anything special.As far as the DVD went, the special features are rather weak and the video/audio is decent."
4,Quirky British Dark Comedy,"British gangster movie? Yes and no.This film has a great cast. Many will be familiar to most of you. It has three, or was it four,story lines converging to an unknown climax.I love movies like this. I hope you do too."
2,"An OK film, nothing more....","The first time I saw this, I liked it a bit, but I wasn't overly impressed. It was British, slick, but I never felt like I had seen a masterpiece of the British gangster genre (The Long Good Friday is light years better than this. Even lighter films like The League of Gentlemen and The Lavender Hill Mob are much better than this one. So is Donald Cammell's Performance.). Watching it again recently on The Sundance Channel, it's really a vain, shallow film, with very predictable dialogue that sounds Tarantinoesque, except with Cockney accents. It's really trying to be hip, edgy, and clever, but it's really rather tiresome and ultimately boring. Most people have said it's a U.K. ripoff of Quentin, and there's some truth to that. The film has a cute title, and it's nice to see London, but aside from that, I can't really think of anything this film can offer you. If you've seen it once, that's all you need."
2,despite all odds,I am well read and this book is dated. If you read the newspapers and keep up with the Jewish culture you would know everything in this book already. There is no insight here and the author is too pro this group so he does not see beyond. Very disappointed. Maybe that is why it was under $2.00
5,"'The Voice': simply recorded, simply silky, simply great","This 97-song, 4-CD set includes a large 68-page handsomely illustrated booklet and contains the best of Sinatra's work, mainly ballads and some swingy tunes, of the period 1943-52. One can easily hear the smooth phrasing and pure tonal quality of young Sinatra's voice in the 1940's, the silky sound that made 'em swoon, a time before years of overuse and overdoing took their toll on his instrument."
5,Charming & Provocative,"The collaboration between text and illustration make this delightful book an extraordianry success on many levels. It is both humorous and thought-provoking, ironic and poetic, wry and sublime. Lerner's spare, minimal drawings are as eloquent as Michael's words. I would like to buy a dozen to give as gifts if only it weren't so difficult to find!"
2,Not As Good,"Unfortunately I wasn't impressed with this read. Having read and owning copies of all the original V.C. Andrews books and having been a captured reader of HER books, I can only say that when her reads came out originaly, I believed this writer to be a PHENOMENON, and still do! However this book, as well as many of the other books, written by 'other hired writers' just don't seem to cut it for me. These writings done after her death don't seem to have the same appeal and have never been able to capture her forte. For me, this book was another disappointment. In my mind there will never be anyone who can write her books and I think most of the new books written by 'other writers' just shouldn't be using her name. But that's just my opinion.I keep buying them or getting them at local library, so it's something in them that keeps me coming back. I think though, that it is the hope of finding another one that can equal Victoria's writing herself. And that's just never going to happen. Sorry."
2,Hm,"Star's not really better or worse than her predecessor, Misty. Her story isn't VCA caliber, but it's not a bad book for teens to read. It seems that Neiderman was relying on stereotypes for this book, but by itself it isn't a horrible read, just a lite teen book. Compared to the other books in this series, it's so-so."
1,UGH!,"I too am one of the fans of the older, more intense novels. The only one in this series so far with anything even remotely shocking is ""Jade"". The narrative style is horrible--considering that the girls are speaking, the language is very unconversational. Who would really tell an oral story using phrases like ""She looked at me sadly, her eyes searching me like two tiny headlights."" Which brings me to another complaint: Every girl uses the cheesiest metaphors, and none have a distinctive voice--each story sounds like it's being told by the same girl. If I hadn't gotten these first three for 1/2 off, I'd be mad at the waste of money. But I guess they were worthy of 1 star and $2.00 each for keeping me mildly amused for a few hours... I will buy cat and the reunion novels but only when they too are 1/2 off or in the used bookstores. I agree with the person who said these last 2 series have been an insult to VC Andrews' name and writing!"
1,Terrible,"This book was really unsatisfying. I thought that the Orphans series was bad, but this is truly an embarassment. I miss the old thicker books. These books are like pre-teen drivel! I thought I'd never say this, but the series has forced me to never buy another VC Andrews book again. I just don't want to be disappointed anymore. It's too hard on my pocketbook."
4,"Great value, but........","For the casual reloader, this press is an exceptional value and it produces a quality shotgun shell. I have used it without complaint. Like so many other shooters, I've decided to experiment with 3/4 oz. shot loads. This idea is popular enough that manufacturers commonly offer wads designed for a 3/4 oz. load and more reloading recipes are becoming available. When I didn't find a 3/4 oz. shot bushing with my press, I e-mailed Lee customer service and was disappointed to learn that they don't make that bushing. This leaves the reloader with no option but to hand dip the shot load for each shell. This is probably something the potential buyer will want to consider before making the purchase."
3,Works OK but can come lose,"I got one of these clips, and it worked great for the most part. BUT - the phone sometimes unclips itself and falls out when sitting in the car or in a chair and falls on the floor.I happened to walk close to the corner of a wall, and it stripped the phone right off, tearing the little clip part apart.I do like having the phone within easy reach on my belt, and am trying to decide whether to go with the clip again, or get something different."
2,Expensive for how long it lasts,"This clip is definitely useful, but it could be made better considering how much it costs. The flat metal spring that held the clip closed over my belt slowly deformed over a couple months, so the clip didn't close any more and the whole thing just fell off my belt. I found cheaper ones at my local electronics superstore that didn't do that (but broke other ways). If you want a belt clip, this will work, but you have to face it...this isn't the last one you'll buy."
4,great information on running,"this book provides good information on running in a format that makes it easy to read and ""digest"" the information provided. a great bookshelf reference!"
3,The first step into running but far from complete...,"This is book has pretty basic information about running. I mean the type of information you can achieve on public websites and blogs, however with the advantage of being compiled into one single book. Some of the information presented need to be further studied if you wish to take running seriously, however this is a good start if you now nothing of running and can't spend a few hours looking for the information out there."
1,Cheap crown,"We put this on our daughter's wishlist because she loves to dress up and a flashing crown seemed like a great idea. I didn't expect it to be great, but I was surprised by how cheap it was. The feathers immediately come off. The button to turn it on and off doesn't function very well. The flash is ok, but doesn't match the tiara. All in all, it is cheap and not worth the money."
2,Book lacks in-depth coverage.,"I was disappointed with this book, but I wanted to voice my opinion as to why. I didn't want to just say it was stupid like the other reader did. The majority of this book covers nail and hair tips, none of which are anything more than common sense. There's one chapter on skin care, which I did find interesting and informative. The book references white women, so if you're a women of color, you might not find any useful information. Although I'm white, my skin is dark, so I felt that I was at a loss here. The book does dedicate one chapter to women with darker skin, but it really doesn't offer anything useful. What I hated most about this book was it's format. It's written as a question and answer guide. Some people do prefer that type of book, I don't because you don't really get explantions in detail. The book was not a total waste of time, but I wouldn't recommend to someone, unless it was given to you as a gift or you bought it used."
2,Not my favorite comedy,"In fact I'm not at all a Ray Romano fan, so I wasn't surprised that the love scenes just don't have any passion.In a story where we are supposed to believe that a plumber takes on the ex-president of the USA, you just don't believe anybody exceptMarcia Gay Harden who brings off her role as the presidential aid.I really thought this was a stinker of a movie."
1,Away from his life-jacket of TV Ray Romano cannot act,"Last night we partook of WELCOME TO MOOSEPORT the breakout movie of comedian and TV star Ray Romano. Simply, the guy cannot act. Ray Romano is awful in this movie. I enjoy Everybody Loves Raymond, but his film can be smelled 5 miles off. If you watch the DVD version and want to laugh listen to the director's commentary. The director goes on and on about how funny Romano is in a scene and how he adlibs and how that is so funny. Well the whole time you are watching these scenes you sit there wondering if you are watching the same person as the director.While Gene Hackman and the supporting cast do a good job holding up their end, Romano is just attrocious.Don't buy this one. Really ZERO stars."
2,Great Actors Wasted In Small Town Niceties,"Poor Ray Romano gets his first big film with great actors and it's a sad flop. Sure, there is Gene Hackman playing his funny reprisal from ""The Birdcage"", but Ray is lost without his TV family. The plot is simple - both Ray and the ex-Prez Hackman are running for mayor of the small town of Mooseport, but the laughs are few. Most tragic of all is the wasting of Marcia Gay Harden as Hackman's assistant and Rip Torn is reduced to a minor role. It is a large cast of good B-actors as well. This film could have been something big, but the writing just wasn't there. There are lots of extra, like deleted scenes and such, but they don't add anything to the film that might have been."
3,Ray Romano can only play one character,"It seems that Romano can only play the character he also plays in his sitcom 'Everybody Loves Raymond' and that is sad sometimes. Thank God for Gene Hackman who shows his versatility by playing a retired former President who enters the mayoral race for the town of Mooseport Maine where he lives now after divorcing his wife. In a battle about a girl Romano also enters the race and an epic political battle ensues.I saw this movie on the airplane and it was fun to watch, but nothing special"
1,Ugh.,"Don't waste your time or money on this movie. It is the worst movie I've seen in over a year, hands down(and I've seen Paycheck). It's boring and stupid beyond belief. I can't believe so many known actors were in the same film.Gene Hackman is ok. Ray Romano is bland, I felt nothing for his character whatsoever. The plot, or lack of same, is absolutely horrific."
1,This was not even a star,"This was just someone flicking a match in the nights sky. I went to this junk movie and just hated it. Too bad they couldn't iond some one else besides Raymond. Gene Hackman was as great as normal, but unless you are the biggest Hackman or Ramono fan, Don't bother seeing this. If you are a big Ramano fan be ready for a disappointment because he really lets down in this one. If you're a really big Hackman fan, you still might not want to see this as his role carries the entire movie in a noticeable way, and it is really sad to see Hackman have to work so hard."
3,A little dated,"There is not much survey done on the afterlife and this book has the merit of giving and idea of what people thought in the '80. But 20-30 years after, this book isn't worth much without an updated version that gives a comparative to today's thinking."
4,ALMOST THE DUKE,"THIS IS THE MOVIE JOHN WAYNE WANTED TO MAKE FOR REPUBLIC. IT CONTAINS THE SAME SUPPORT CHARACTERS, SUB-PLOTS, AND EVEN SOME OF THE SAME LINES AS ""THE ALAMO"" AS WAYNE ORIGONALY PLANNED IT. IF YOU ARE INTERESTED, HE WAS TO PLAY BOWIE, NOT DAVY CROCKETT."
3,Excellent Music - Average Quality Audio,"I purchased this CD download to fill a couple gaps in my Johnny Cash collection. I purchased the entire CD hoping to get better quality ""remastered"" tracks. I was somewhat disappointed that the quality of the downloaded files (which were only OK) for the ""The Essential Johnny Cash"" CD were not as good as the MP3s that I currently had in my collection. I was expecting a bit more for the cost (> $20)."
5,the essential Jonny Cash 1955-1983,"I was very impressed with this purchase. I order this box set for my brother, who has wanted my box set. So a friend informed me to go to Amazon.com and they will have this box set. I was so surprise and my brother was even more surprise when he received it. Thanks so much, and it is so comforting to have this service at my finger tips. Congrads on a job well done."
5,QUESTION?,"I can't decide whether to buy this set or the four-disc""The Legend."" How are the liner notes in this set? Does it give good info on each track, where and when the song was recorded and who played on it? [...]"
4,ScribsRN,"I've bought several pairs of these shoes over the years, now I just can't decide which color to try next! I am an ER nurse and spend a lot of time on my feet. These were even great during my last pregnancy. Very durable too. Some of my friends recommend these over their Danskos."
3,so so,not as good as the first oneslow and sometimes painful. sub par acting and they seemed to drag out many scenes
2,Exact same plot as first,I love the idea. The lead actor is not interesting and there are a lot of holes left in the story. There is one wonderful sex scene in the beginning. It occurs while he is in love so it is engaging.
2,mad,"This is nothing like the movie Buttwefly effect, I thought it would be a sequial or at least similar to the first movie. I was really disapointesd."
3,butterfly 2,"It has it's moments and i liked it for the most part. Same idea as the first film, just different people and different situations. Basically,the guy has it down between either his girfirend and his job and each time he tries to change his past, different things surrounding the two aspects change. I guess he just can't have both huh? There's not much to say about Buttefly 2. Either you like it or you don't."
3,Good CD....But not the best.,"This was overall a good CD, however many of the songs start sounding monotenous after awhile."
2,Where is the software,Just got the package. There was no CD in it. The web address given in the book to download the software is not correct. Not good.
3,Get the European Import Instead,A pity to see that some of the most interesting titles have been omitted from this CD. Get the European cut insted!
1,Voiceless operetta.,"Beware, it's instrumental. I thought I may spend a nostalgic evening on the porch listening to forgotten melodies. A bitter disappointment."
1,Poor packaging,"The picture looked good. It was exactly what I needed. However I never received it!The reason is that the shipping packaging was so poor, the package fell apart during shipping and was never delivered. Not just once, but 3 times in a row!After each instance of tracking the shipment through FedEx, the reason for return was ""Damaged product during shipment, returned to origin"".I talked with Amazon, canceled the order and re-ordered. The same thing happened 3 times - damaged during shipment.This was NOT a FedEx problem. The company who ships this item uses very sub-standard packaging.I would try a 4th time to re-order, but not until I receive something from the ""Company"" (not Amazon) that their packaging methods have improved.Amazon did everything to help me in this matter, and I applaud them for their efforts."
4,"Remaster has ""bonus material"" that's not even advertised!","Whether or not you're interested in this particular album depends on a lot on whether you're interested in Traffic. But if you're a Traffic fan, be sure you get the 2003 remaster rather than any other CD version. That's because the remaster includes the full-length versions of ""Roll Right Stones"" and ""(Sometimes I Feel So) Uninspired."" Besides this remaster and the earliest (U.S.?) LP copies, ALL copies of SHOOT OUT have shortened versions of these songs. ""Uninspired"" was faded out just a little early (about 15 seconds), but ""Roll Right Stones"" lost a full 2 minutes. The 2003 remaster is the ONLY place to get the full-length versions on CD.I don't know why none of this was pointed out in any advertising for the remaster or in its liner notes.(P.S.: Note that a few of the reviews here are referring to CD editions that contain the shorter versions of these songs. The full, remastered version of the album is longer than 37:39, for example.)"
5,Excellent!,"If all could read this book, it might help meople to understand what is happening to the people of Palestine."
2,boring release from a great band,"Only one other review for this album-- sad! Not because this album is great, which it isn't, but because the band itself is great, one of the greatest. If you are impressed by this album, I envy you, because their other albums should completely blow you away. This one is very boring and uninspired by comparison. The unique Obliveon sound is there, but the riffs and arrangements are overly simplistic and go nowhere. I hate to make this accusation, since it gets made all over the place by anyone who doesn't like something, but this is obviously a commercial effort. After years of laboring in undeserved obscurity, they were probably looking for a wider audience-- I don't blame them, but I wish the results were a little more engaging. Or maybe they were running out of inspiration, since they split up not long after this was released"
5,From a Red Sox's fan view...,"Even though I am a diehard Red Sox fan, I absoulety loved this book. It was funny, out-rageous, informative, honest, everything you could possibly want from a sports book.And yes, I almost tore the book into when Pearlman gave a detailed account of Game 6."
2,"Great Team, Great Story, Bad Writing","I'm a huge Met fan and was extrememly excited to read this book. I knew I was in trouble after the first chapter. Mr. Pearlman's writing style is childish and amature. Despite my interest in the subject matter, I found myself painfully trying to get through this book. Couldn't finish it. Just terrible."
2,Could have been terrific,"Interesting at times but is very oddly (badly?) organized. Pearlman is a fine writer but could have used a better editor.Further, the book adds little to the story of the '86 Mets... you're not likely to read anything you didn't already know.I bought the book the day after it came out - I had high expectations and was badly let down."
2,Vineyard,"All he wanted was a wife. One that would love, honor, and care for him. He kept getting women that used him for his money, so he locked them in the basement. He has dreams and wakes up to find himself turning into a monster. He has to beg his lord to make him young again. In his Vineyard there are bodies of the dead which return to life night after night. When a group of would be actors and actresses visit the island to be in one of his movies, will they figure out his darkest secrets?"
5,Wonderful and relaxing winter Sounds!,"Love this album its sounds and everything about it. I Love winter in general and this Album puts me into a real winter mood, freezing...cold but also warm!I found another great release coming from a winter wonderland the Dolomites in Italy.This album series is called ""Dolomiti Super Chill"" and you find 2 of them here at Amazon.Check it out!!"
4,"Drags, but overall a great movie.","Great action, amazing performances, and good concept. Like the new ending. But this movie could've been 15 minutes shorter."
1,Don (Blu-Ray) Sold By lola's dream is not in a Blu-Ray format it's DVD,"Hi, AllI bought this from Amazon last month and realize now when I watch it that this movie sold by Lola's Dream is not a Blu-Ray at all. The cover is blu-ray but the disc is a DVD format. DO NOT GET THIS MOVIE. I will be making an official complain to amazon about this. Lola's Dream is a con company."
5,"""What the Puritans really believed"" or ""Stupidity at Plymouth Rock""","This is an engrossing book that covers women's rights, religion, history, puritan thought and many other subjects with a deft hand that is objective in spite of the author being a descendant of the remarkable woman in the title. Because parts of it are from trial transcripts of the time, the language makes for slower reading than a ""Chick lit"" book, but the text is full of things to make a reader gasp or sometimes steam in indignation at the pompous stupidlty of some of our early founding fathers.I will be buying more copies as gifts."
4,Super Reader,"A telegram faked to appear as if it was from Doc Savage, multiple murders, including the telegraph operator, and a couple of fellow passengers from Spain.This leads Doc travelling with his gang to see the relatives, to discover what the whole Brand of the Werewolf seen on the train is about.His cousin Patricia has been attacked, betrayed by a servant. His uncle Alex has been murdered.A mysterious ivory cube of his uncle's has been stolen.This all leads to skeletons, sunken treasure, capture, escape, and an explosive finale.3.5 out of 5"
5,Out of print but still the best,"We tend to forget how these machines work, and how easily they can be fooled to deliver inaccurate results. Wahner, Blake, and Fogelman make this clear, and easy to understand for the medical professional. Even though its out of date as to software and makes and models, the physics hasn't changed and the new machines still have the same issues. Lots of examples of poor scans, many of which I still see today on a daily basis in the field, yet go unrecognized by techs and physicians alike."
1,Honestly the worst book I have read,"Too be honest, this is only my opinion! This was the WORST book I ever read EVER!! (...)I thought it was confusing and boring! This book talks about this spoiled, rude super brat! I honestly dont know if I just didn't like the book because I was confused or just couldnt relate! But this is my opinion, please dont let me stop you from reading this book! But, I do have to give the author some credit, (...)this book is always on TV! Talking about how great the book is! Good luck!"
4,Gossip Girl fan,"I absolutely love the television show and thought what the heck why not check out the books. I'm so glad I did. The books follow a very similar storyline; however some of the characters' details are different, but still quite enjoyable. Quick and easy read!"
5,The Diary The World Has Been Waiting to Read Now Unlocked !,"After many years of protecting the secrets of the Golden era inHollywood Barbara Leigh has finally decided to unlock and dust off her well kept protected diary. Reading this book is a true trip back into time, one that truly makes you feel as if you were meeting Elvis for the first time and experience what it was like to be part of the whole ""road scene life"" with the King. This without a doubt is the best Hollywood love triangle story ever. After reading the book, one truly wonders what fights could still be going on in the ""Heavens"" over a girl named Barbara. Not only is this one of the best books you will ever read but lets not forget any unlocked diary of Vampirella's lovers is priceless alone......"
4,Great Kay does it again,"My wife and I loved the DVD, only one question, there were missing parts, like who was the young boy in the beginning?The end left me wonderingI would watch it again, Kate brings one into her personal needs and desires. well actedMike"
3,"Nice design, but dull","I know if you're buying Cubic Zirconium, you really shouldn't expect too much, but I've seen some beautiful ones, so I was hopeful with this. The CZ ""stone"" in the middle is foggy, almost. You can only tell if you're looking closely, but it's still there. Looks like a real diamond from far away.It's about the size of your pinkie fingernail - not too big, but it catches the light and sparkles everywhere.I'd definitely buy another one of these if it weren't for the foggy quality of the stone."
2,Nice for a large tent set up for several days or longer,"This thing is just enough of a pain to set up and carry around that it is worth it only if you are camping for at least a few nights in a larger tent. We use it for 4-5 night music festivals & such where it can be great to have . For 2-3 nights in the same spot it just isn't worth it, as it is a bit heavy, kind of a pain to set up, and all around just too much trouble."
3,bloated,"as most engineering books, this one lacks depth and rigor. the development of the theories is often cluttered with TOO many examples.this seems a swing to another extreme from most mathematical books where the naration is often too formal and lacks examples. (that old fool Rockafellar's book doesn't have one single figure in the entire book!)IMHO, something in between is needed."
1,Amazon has this as a recommendation of mine- Afraid NOT!,"Not sure how Amazon comes up with a person's recommendations, but it is not a list I made, as I do not like South Park, but there they have it in my recommendations, and yes I have seen a few episodes. Interesting writing sometimes, but I hate that kind of cartoon look. It even annoys me, and it is a little too crude in general for me, or appealing to the stupid too much, or something, maybe exemplified by the very basic style of the cartoon drawings. I don't care if other people like it, so don't bother to comment. Just get it off my list, and then you can remove this review."
1,petsafe dog door,Door is poorly designed and of marginal quality. Problems include:- in a mild breeze door fly's like a kite (opens wide)- door attaching hardware is very poor (plastic or nylon)Really disappointed in the installation and overall quality of the dog door. In a minor wind it might as well not be there. Had to re-engineer installation with new hardware to make more robust. Really not worth the cost.
2,A 95 page check-list of B-Western heroines,"A fine tool for the researchers as far as it goes, this ultra-slim volume is written by two well-known enthusiasts. A little broader knowledge of film history, however, could have spared the authors the embarrasment of including French-born ACTOR Jean Del Val among their ""Saddle Gals""!"
2,It does NOT have Spanish subtitles,I bought this version specifically because it said it had Spanish subtitles (I'm learning Spanish). It does not. I tried playing it with several different programs and none of them detected Spanish subtitles. I ended up selling it back to Amazon. Not happy about this at all. If you were looking at this because it claims to have Spanish subtitles (why else would you be looking at it instead ofthe cheaper more popular version that's on Amazon) then you can stop right here and don't waste your money.
4,Doesn't disappoint,"Editor Pam Keesey has done several anthologies of spooky lesbian stories and this is one of her best. Every single story works as part of a chain to add up to some truly nightmarish, sexy chills."
1,This book was not what I had imagined.,"I was disappointed in this book. Daughters of Darkness did not get under my skin, I'm still waiting to be bitten with a tale of desire sharply erotic."
3,TWO GREAT ONES!,"Of course, ""Carmilla"" is the queen of lesbian vampire stories; its subtlety is something to savor. But I must confess, I really loved ""O Captain, My Captain."" Its sci-fi angle (interstellar travel) is well-researched; its protagonist is a very plausible, likable young woman; and its love scenes are DELICIOUS. These two stories alone make the book worth buying."
3,Sexy book,"This book was a good read. Some of the stories were quite erotic; others were a bit too out there for me. Gotta love a good lesbian vampire story, though. ;) Would definitely recommend it!"
3,Sweet & Syrupy But A Must for Every Golf Nut,"When I first saw this movie I was in the most intense phase of my golf obsession; I would've watched a Hogan movie if it was made with stick figures on a flip pad. I'm guessing that most thoughtful golfers ""liked"" this movie but hungered for something more. Hogan was a complex, fascinating character who deserved a more nuanced portrait. Why no one has ever attempted such a movie escapes me.The movie is pleasant enough and Glenn Ford was certainly an accomplished actor but he was the wrong choice for the Hogan role. I don't know too much about all the actors of that day but a character actor who could convey subtleties might have created a more memorable movie.The previous reviewer mentions the book ""Hogan"" by Curt Sampson and I also highly recommend that book if you want a deeper, more complex look at Hogan, both as a human being and as a golfer."
5,Now This Is A Horror Film !,"When you watch a new low-budget indie horror film & at the end as the credits roll you find yourself picking your jaw back up off the floor,thats when you know you stumbled apon something very special & thats exactly what happend to me after viewing Travis Betz's horror freak-show 'JOSHUA'. I'm not even gonna begin to try & explain the movie,all i'm gonna say is that this is simply one of the best horror films i have ever seen & i am so glad i stumbled into this gem! All you video store weekender's Look'n for nightmares rent this one if you can find it & as for collectors like myself this one is a future cult classic must!"
3,Artful Applique,"Very well illustrated. Projects are beautiful and any appliquer would be happy to have this referece book. Lots of hints and very helpful to this novice ""needle turner."""
5,Perfect,I bought this for christmas for a firefighter. He loved this and raved it was the best gift he ever recieved!!!!
4,Fine political film,"Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) and wife Susan (Emma Thompson) are a political team who have evolved from 60s idealism to 90s pragmatism. Jack is the heart and Susan is the brain; as conflicted as they are as a result of Jack's infidelities, they are committed to ""making history"" and know that neither one of them can do it alone. This film follows their campaign for the Democratic nomination and the crises of conscience undergone by their staff workers (Adrian Lester, Kathy Bates, Billy Bob Thornton) as they make their peace (or not) with the hardball choices and compromises that a serious bid for the presidency entails.Director Mike Nichol and screenwriter Elaine May have made a perceptive and serious yet entertaining and often very funny film about the American political process."
3,does a good job...,"...of portraying liberals' uneasy truce with the whole Clinton circus, as our admiration for his ability to win middle-American hearts and votes comes in constant tension with our deep sense of unease about his slimey amorality. On the other hand, most of the suporting characters are sort of half-baked and if anything John Travolta isn't as good a performer as the Fellatee-in-Chief.I know it's obnoxious when people say this, but in this case it's true: the book was a lot better."
2,I have to disagree,"Primary Colors is not a good film. John Travolta's Bill Clinton imitation starts wearing on the nerves very quickly and his accent is a crime against nature. Emma Thompson who is normally great is bland here. The only three people who really shine and almost make this a worthwile film are Billy Bob Thornton, Larry Hagman and Kathy Bates. Bates is particularly good as a politial operative who alas was a true believer and is crushed when she realizes that her gods are no better than their opponents.Primary Colors isn't funny. It's not deep. It's not even witty and it doesnt' even cut it as a roman a clef. Sometimes terrific books in the hands of the wrong director or with the wrong actors just don't translate well to the big screen. This is one of those times."
5,Omelette Excellence,"In Julia Child's book HOW TO COOK, this is a first cousin of the pan that she is using in the photographs and recommends in the text by Wearever brand name for making omelettes. I tried a Chantal but was grossly disappointed in its performance for omelettes. Incorrect radius for folding over the omelette and it sticks. Also hard to clean.My first attempt with this Wearever could not have been better. The curvature is correct and the pan is slick. Butter in the pan until bubbling, then two prescrambled eggs, a few shakes and the eggs and filling rolled up on themselves without the help of a fork."
1,"Doesnt stay synced, rip off","CONTINUOUSLY have to pair/sync this with my phone. It will stop typing mid sentence, then I have to turn the keyboard off then back on with the cheap, hard to move switch. This will happen about every 5 or 6 words typically, but can range from way more to way less. Whats way less than 5 words you ask? Pressing one button and have it continually be entered on the screen since the connection was lost, then having to erase the repeated letters that were entered, then the delete key does the same thing erasing possibly your entire message. This happens even right after its been charged, so cant be the battery.Id expect more out of such an expensive product. Having an extra thing to charge every couple of days (NOT 2 WEEKS) is an extra annoyance I'd be willing to put up with if this thing worked. This has driven me to sell my iPhone and buy a smartphone with a keyboard built in (Droid 4). If you need a keyboard, buy a phone that has one already."
3,It is ok.,"The battery has to be charged daily. The keyboard lacks that feel or ""click"" of other phone keyboards.Looks nice. Sides well."
2,Lifeless; ordinary,"This is not one of Crossgen's better works (that would be their ""Way of the Rat"" or ""The Path"" series'). The story is continually ""voiced-over"" with a running commentary by the grating ""rogue"" hero. The characters all seem to be drawn with porn stars as the models--the women are big-chested and preternaturally beautiful; the guys are all long-haired and unshaven. You're supposed to really feel for the heroine and her desire for revenge on the evil sorcerer who killed her family but it's really just tiresome and cliched. This series is, at the very best, really well-done eye candy."
1,Absolutely the worst product,I would give this 0 stars but the option does not exist. Do not waste your money these tweezers are completely useless. I got a free lighted mirror and pedicure set but it was still not worth the money!!!
4,I Love Mine...,"My Mom bought me these and I love them. When you tweeze with the light and the magnifying lense you can see hairs that you didn't know you had, lol. Seriously though, I do recommend them."
5,Can't be without it,Gave this book to my student teacher when he left. I have an older addition and use it all the time in physical education. Worth every penny!
2,Jenkins or Disney?,"When first playing this disk I was surprised - I had to check the label to make sure I had not picked up something more related to the film score from Mary Poppins. The first and last tracks are much more akin to Dick Van Dyke's renderings from the Disney classic than the earlier works of Jenkins such as Adiemus.Unfortunately, the rest of the tracks do not make up for the initial disappointment."
5,"Another excellent ""buddhism meets western science"" book","HHDL has had a lifelong interest in the intersection of buddhist thought and western science, and he has attracted many westerners to buddhism because of it. This is another excellent book on the subject. Highly recommended."
3,A Cult Hit,This movie is the type of movie you will remember for a time to come. When I saw it years and years ago it left an effect on me. What type of effect? I have yet to figure it out. Rent find this movie and watch the dumb fun
1,Still waiting,"I am still waiting for this item to ship. I ordered in on August 9, it is September 7 and this item has not left any shelf to make its long journey to me. Fantastic customer service here.The movie itself is great, from what I remember so many moons ago. Funny and totally in sync with the time it was made.Still waiting for it to be delivered though. Which is sad, cause when I ordered it, there was stock."
3,Just a side note,The editorial review is incorrect as it was not haley's comet. It was a comet that passed earth some 50 million years ago-- just when the dinos went extinct. Haley's comes every 76 years. This is how they give you the foreshadowing- ie it comes dinos went. It comes this time and.. you get the picture. Other than that it was a pretty good 80's flick. and remember....The burden of civilization is upon us...and don't forget about the scarey noises game.
3,This film still freaks me out!!,"Don't know if it has something to do with the campy feel, or the eerie feel of the film's environment- Ah heck, maybe it's Catherine Mary Stewart's (The Last Starfighter)wardrobe! This movie still gets me for a horror film from the eighties. What would it be like to fall asleep during the passing of a comet while others were outside celebrating the event, to wake up and find people have been replaced by red dust, or zombies! It's all about survival at this point! Man, this movie still gives me the willies after all these years, and God bless you Catherine Mary Stewart...I still got a crush on you!!!"
4,A long time fave,"""Night of the Comet"" was one of the first video titles I ever owned - on an old RCA CED videodisc. When the CED discs and players became obsolete, I eventually sold them all off to someone with the desire and resources to try to preserve them. I was therefore delighted to find it on DVD.The story is simple, but this is a film with a heart, featuring excellent performances all around. It's an apocalyptic film that can make you feel good about human survival without preaching to you. Highly recommended..."
3,Great start...terrible finish,"The movie does have nice visuals and the crash of the space ship is done very well. In fact, the visuals on the planet surface almost make you feel warm. Unfortunately, all of the tension and action builds to an absolutely absurd and anticlimactic finish. Too bad even to be categorized as predictable. I will probably purchase it just so that I can have access to the nice bits but it is lightyears away from much better horror/scifi such as Event Horizon or Alien."
3,Rent it then you decide,"Good things: Sounds is good, special effects are excellent and video quality is good also. Bad things: The beginning is boring. I even slept for 15 minutes and didn't miss a thing. Nothing spectacular about the alien creatures, and not even the way they kill.My recomendation: Rent it and be the judge."
3,"Great Action, weak plot","The first time I saw this movie I stepped in while my friends were watching it. I honestly thought it was one of those alien respawns like ""alien 3, or alien : ressurection"" or whatever they are. I really dont watch that much sci-fi because not much sci-fi is good. This movie was fully equipped with a bald chick, a group of crazy creatures and even an environment that was reminiscient of Alien.I took it in stride though, and I actually started to like it. The action and suspense is good, and it was a bit of a touching ending. I would watch it a third time, but I doubt I would buy it. The replay value of a movie such as this is not large.Go rent this movie. I wouldn't reccomend buying it until you at least see it."
4,Very Interesting,"Anyone who sees this movie for the first time should be warned that it's shot with a very unique style. It's ... different. :) That's the only thing I can think of to describe it. Lots of quick cuts and shaky action at times. Great visual effects, though.Vin Diesel IS this movie. During the first half of the movie I wasn't really getting into it (probably because of the weird directing style), but once it got darker, and he got more lines, it got very interesting. He's definately one to watch. (You can also see him in Saving Private Ryan.)"
3,Creepy Sci-Fi Fun!,"The buzz surrounding this sci-fi horror flick was uniformly strong here in L.A. earlier this year, and my friends and I weren't disappointed when we went to the theater. For a genre picture with no stars, it's better than you'd expect, with fiendish, dinosaurlike monsters and hold-your-breath suspense."
1,WHAJT,"I dont understand how people could think this movie was great, it was so boring. Subpar acting by Vin Diesel as always, ok plot a plus, except for the fact of why there were so many civilians, the thing that ticked me off the most was the ending, it made no sense; did i miss something, or was vin diesel not a con. they should have ended the movie with everyone dying except vin diesel, if they wanted to make a sequal so badly."
4,"A must see, if only for the fx","Sure, the plot is derivative and uneven in spots, but the visual effects used in Pitch Black are quite stunning in spots. There is above average acting from a cast full of new-comers, and the plot DOES have some twists and turns that should keep your eyes open, even late at night. Twohy has captured the ""post-modern"" technique (quick jumpshots, fluid-motion, color variations) quite well. A good omen for the future of ""scinema."""
5,Pitch Black,I am fully satisfied with my order. It was exactly what I expected. I will not hesitate a second to buy from this seller again. Everything was just perfect. Thank you very much!
2,Pitch Black,"The special effects were cool, especially with the sky and the planets. Riddick's eyes were cool. The acting was average/poor. The events were too convinient to be taken seriously. For example, they just HAPPENED to crash on the planet when it was going to get dark. And that happened once every 20-some years? It was also convinient that one of the characters could see in the dark. This movie had some good parts. I especially liked how Riddick did that shoulder-out-of-joint trick to get free of that pole. But overall this movie was a waste of time. I recommend this movie to anyone lacking a better imagination."
2,Nothing new to see here!,"I bought the Unrated Director's Cut of this film with great anticipation. I loved the theatrical release of Pitch Black. It is one of my favorite science fiction films, hands down.But the Unrated Director's Cut? Is a waste of money. The additions to the film were so few and so subtle, I barely noticed them. The Unrated part? More violence? Not noticeably. More cussing? More bare skin? No, neither of those. And the extras? Are almost non-existent. There's nothing on this DVD that I didn't get on the first one, except some hype about the sequel, and not even that was very convincing. Seriously, if you already own this film on DVD, don't waste your money on this reissue.If you don't own this film on DVD, see if you can find the original release. At least it has the theatrical trailers."
4,"Very, very cool flic",Turn off your brain and have fun..this is a really slick movie if you give it a chance. I've been waiting for this DVD for quite some time :)
4,Good SiFi flick,"Not for the wee folk, but I enjoyed... some really good special effects. Lots of action"
3,Not frightening,"This film is beautifully filmed, well acted and good for a couple of hours' entertainment. What it is not is frightening, or at least, not as frightening as it tries to be. Watch the original 'Alien' instead if you want to see how Sci-Fi horror should be done."
4,Good movie with one caveat.,"Overall, I like the movie, but I have to remove one star, because of a few things that I thought were unrealistic. The main character, played by Radha Mitchell, went into a hole to search for a guy that obviously got mawled by some unknown creatures. After almost getting killed, too, she escapes out of the hole, exclaiming, ""That was a stupid thing to do!"" or something like that. No kidding! I just hate when characters do really dumb things. Other than that, the picture and sound quality is excellent in HD, and the story line is interesting. I won't give too much away. I give it a 4."
3,Warning: Boring review landing. Purge!,"Over-edited thriller reminiscent of 70's Sci-Fi like 'The Illustrated Man' and 'Idaho Transfer'. Disappointment seems to have arisen over the fact that it isn't really a monster movie, more a morality play with the forces of nature well in the backgound as a catalyst. Those without a strong interest in metaphysics may feel themselves under-catered for. The film's holiness will make it stand the test of time in my opinion although some vulgar direction and self-conscious profanity is unhelpful at times, at least the cast seems uncomfortable delivering it. Is faith rewarded and does God intervene? Whether it is the Christian God or Allah that shines upon our survivors at the film's close will be hotly debated at length by ooh, absolutely nobody, I should think."
2,not very flattering,"This product was okay to wear once; they fit me okay at first but by the end of the day, the material stretched creating unflattering wrinkles in the pelvic area. Too pricy for what they're worth. I wouldn't recommend them."
2,Fun for kids; fun for adults,"The kids (ages 6 to 9) were interested in this toy somewhat, but after assembling it twice, (because it blew apart the first time), and then assembling it again the second time it blew apart after running for 20 minutes or so. The spring case was subsequently cracked and is now useless. The toy would have some usefulness if it worked properly, but is now consigned to a box of gears & spare parts. This was a sad end for this Christmas present."
2,fun but fragile,"The product seems to be well designed from an educational point of view - my daughter (almost turned 8) assembled it with no help what-so-ever. However, winding it up to much (even actually not that much) causes it to (a) literally blow apart from stress and (b) strip part of the main spring gear. Stripping the gear makes the toy useless. A new manufacturing run either with a redesign to lower the stress or with an improvement of the strength of parts would make this toy into an award winner."
5,All the Messianic Prophecies of the Bible,I am so thankful to have this put into one book. It makes is so easy to study and very informative. Keep up the great work.
4,Focused on Jesus Christ: The Theme of the Bible,"Jesus Christ is the only Redeemer of sinful man. Jesus Christ is the only full revelation of God, as revealed in the Bible. History is utterly dependent on Jesus Christ, who He is and what He is doing. So this book will take you a long way in focusing your interpretation of scripture on what, or Who, scripture is about. Here is a book that is excellent for one wanting to start studying more in depth the MANY attributes and works of Jesus Christ and how all of history revolves around His sovereignty. Mr. Lockyer does a great job and will get you started, expanding your mind beyond the ""milk"" theology in which so many Christians remain. But be careful. He bought into the very young doctrines of premillennialism and dispensationalism, so you will find his doctrinal explanations as related to the return of Jesus Christ to be ""newspaper"" theology rather than biblical theology."
2,Item not as pictured,"The item I received has a very wide waistband. This is not how it is pictured in the photograph. Also, the waistband is too wide (and not teamed with elastic), just a drawcord. As a result, the fit is quite, quite poor; there is very little adjusting one can do without the waistband bunching up. Result=poor fit. Quite disappointing and MISLEADING promotional photograph."
3,Just not a movie that really does anything for me.,"This movie doesn't do much of anything for me. It seems disjointed and hard to understand but does have some good spots. Some may like the Outback scenery, it's too heat blasted for me. I did like various bits of the scenery and of the story but the viewer has to sit through what I guess is supposed to be an art film, too many disjointed bits. Jenny Agutter's swimming hole scene seemed like an excuse for nudity, it did nothing for the story line unlike the dream sequence at the end where all three ramblers swim nude. If that was meant to give a sense of freedom from the stresses of the modern day world it did a much better job. As for sticking to the book, I haven't read it but I'm not surprised that so little of the story is used, that is so common in movie making."
1,Walkabout,Received this DVD and it was loose in the box. It would not play. I returned the DVD to the address on the mailer. Very disappointed.
3,Erudite and passionate but not necessarily for the masses,"Merton is brilliant and obviously quite learned but I was hoping for more insights for us lay people into the actual act of individual contemplation. Instead, the book's thesis is it's an absolutely necessary act. I could have told him that."
3,BILLY JOE THOMAS CD,"OF THE TWELVE TRACKS ON THIS ALBUM ONLY THREE WOULD LEAD ONE TO BELIEVE THOMAS WOULD GO ON TO BIGGER AND BETTER THINGS.THESE TRACKS ARE:ROCK AND ROLL LULLABY, THE STORIES WE CAN TELL, AND THAT'S WHAT FRIENDS ARE FOR.EVEN THESE AREN'T KNOCK 'EM DEAD SONGS BUT COMPARED TO THE OTHER NINE ON THIS ALBUM THEY STAND OUT.THE REAL REAL VALUE OF THIS ALBUM LIES IN IT'S COLLECTABILITY AS IT DOESN'T COME CHEAP."
5,Good old Willie,"This is from 1998, but was produced by T-Bone Burnett, and still ranks as Willie's most crisp and disciplined CD. I had this on an album and wanted to have it digital, so recently popped for it. If you are a Willie fan, you will love it. If not, and you want a golden voice, you will pan it."
4,Cool Duet of Willie and Emma Lou,Nice listening CD. Hard to find anything by Willie that isn't fun to listen to. Emma and Willie work well together in this collection of easy listening songs.
1,"This crap is not true Willie, he sold out!","Poor old Willie must have not gotten the""good stuff"" from his supplier when recording this album. I've been a faithfull listener of Willies until this mishap. Whatever happened to the good old stoned out of his mind Willie. Those day's rocked, now, it does nothing for me."
5,beautiful music,"Not a big Willie Nelson fan, I bought this CD because I love Emmylou. But they sound great together. It has become one of the most treasured cds in my collection."
3,Definitely Different,"This film is comparable to ""Dance Girl Dance"" in that it dealt with themes not usually found in musical offerings. The other common trait is that both feuture Ralph Bellamy, an actor of versatility whose training came from the stock company tour circuit."
2,Delightfully Pleasant!,"Nice early Jane Powell musical. Good cast and very ""delightful to watch. Could be more enjoyable if print was restored. Not great, but fun."
1,Totally sucks.,"Ever click on somebody's crappy web page from 1995 and think ""Jesus Christ, what IS that terrifying sound!""? Well, it was probably a midi ripped from this CD. I think it's safe to conclude that ""The Ned Nash Orchestra"" is actually some nerd messing around with a synthesizer in his garage. If you're counting on sweeping renditions of classics this is not for you. Then again this CD is not recommended for anybody who cries easily, suffers with migraines, or values music in general."
2,poor recording,"The orchestra was small and the instrumention poor. Most of the pieces were short in comparison to the original movie scores, and tempos of some of the pieces were so different from the original movie scores that it made listening frustrating."
2,Too contrived and plot lines thin,Ship of fools is very readable but I found it rather lacking in the plotting. The author wanted to set up a sense of dread and fear but did so at the cost of any depth. Characters tend to be paper thin and there is not enough background to explain any of their actions. Too much historical background is left unknown never allowing the reader to connect with the story.
1,HUH?,"Exactly what happened in this book?? Spaceship, planet, scary abandoned ship, hitch it on the back of your ship, it starts getting creepy, everyone flips, they break away, the captain goes down with the ship. BORING! the only good thing about this was the endearing Father Veronica."
4,Learned to read French using this book,"More than a simple children's tale, it was my first exposure to a deeper level of the French language. Simplistic on its face, the chapters could be peeled back to reveal existential philosophy. It made for interesting discussions with my fellow book club members who were learning French along with me."
5,Charming classic,Each year I enjoy introducing this charming classic in its original version to a new group of my French students. They are encouraged to purchase their own copy so that they may make notes inside and more importantly have it in their home library where they can pick it up and read it again and again because each time they will find something new to impact their understanding of life.
3,Too juvenile,"I read this book in college. It was a good learning tool, but I think something pitched to adults would have been better. But it is an excellent book to use in teaching children French."
1,ummm...i must be a moron,"Someone please shoot me in the face, am i the only one who didn't enjoy this book. i read it last year in my 4th year honors french class, now up until the semester when we read this book, i had been a fairly good french student, i have family who live in provence, i visit them often and i had never made a B in french until the semester of junior year when we read ""le petit prince"" needless to say i made a C that semester. this was the dumbest thing i've ever laid eyes on...well besides a few girls i know. but who gives a merde about some little kid going from planet to planet asking a bunch of dumb questions, and be in love with a rose. im (upset), cause this made me totally lose intrest in french, and now that im a senior and in AP french...im not trying at all, this book is awful, maybe i should read it in english.......nah. oh well, c'est la vie"
4,GOOD!,"Very happy with the audio. The reader changes voices and keeps it interesting. Overall very satisfied with the product. I listen to it quite often because it helps with pronunciation and speaking french... It helps to first read the book, then read the book with the audio and finally just listen to the audio to gain French Listening skills."
5,CHINATOWN ROCKS!,i'm tired of hearing how bad this album and renegade were!these two albums are awesome and have classic songs! yesthere were some not so strong but there are no duds. AlsoSnowy White is a really good player and plays great on thesealbums and blended well with Scott Gorham. Take a listen againand really listen without comparing to the Live n' Dangerousline up that everyone compares too. These albums rock as muchas Thunder and LIghtning and some of the earlier stuff! Withall the bad music out there I still listen to these all the time.I think true Lizzy and rock fans love these albums and maybe allthe skeptics should give them another try? Rock on!
2,Several hit singles but one of Lizzy's worst albums,"This CD contains several hit singles, but I am always disappointed by this album. The style is simpler more pop-rock and less hard rocking/melodic than the earlier albums with Brian Robertson. A respectable album, but this would be at the bottom of my Thin Lizzy shopping list (I own it on vinyl and will not be getting the CD). [Everybody should have a Thin Lizzy shopping list though!]"
3,My grandson loves it,My grandson loves his Ninja Turtle Lunch Kit. all the kids want one. My daughter likes it as it is easy to clean and very durable.
3,good lunch bag,Decent lunch bag. Seems to be well made. The water bottle is very hard to close and it leaks. My son loves it because 3 other boys in his class have the same one.
3,Resonable effort.,"If you've heard Flavour of the Week, you might have been a little disappointed like me, but then the amazing Implode comes along to save the day. Re-Wind is a release in-between these two albums, and re-mixes some Flavour of the Week tracks (FLA's on disc 1 and other artists on disc 2). Many of the re-mixes give rise to very different sounding songs.At the end of the day, this is far more dance orientated and reminds me of Caustic Grip and Tactical Neural Implant mixed with Flavour, but with hardly any singing - almost in Noise Unit, Drill territory. After Implode, it's rather uninteresting and I have to say I prefer Flavour. This sounds like a serious of B-Side mixes which although are more FLA than Flavour, are not as well mixed and varied.An okay buy, but stick to Implode for a great listen..."
5,Charlatans were originals for their time,"The Charlatans were one of the original bands of the outgrowth of the San Francisco bohemian period of the sixties. Even though the sound quality is not top notch, this album is a good representation of the band in it's heyday with some really great eclectic songs of the psychedelic era. There is some first time blending of country, folk, blues, and New Orleans style jazz with rock'n roll instrumentation. The band was best when experienced live due to their high energy level, but these recordings are the next best thing and can bring back memories of a time that one can only smile upon."
2,Where is the heavy metal guitar tone???,"Lots of people said this is a great DVD, great show... but I have to disagree. If you are a rock fan you should buy it, but if you are a metal fan, you maybe disapointed. Where is the heavy guitar vibe metallica once had in the past?? It is missed on this DVD. The guitars are recorded with low volume and there is no punch. Tired of wah-wah solos by hammet and what about the bass of jason??? simply terrible. I think that maybe not the production's fault but it was recordable at metallica's worst period (during load and reload releases). If you see the perfomance of ""one"" you will be throwing up... IT IS HORRIBLE... Please keep the old metallica albuns, and if you want it a DVD, buy Cliff em all instead!"
2,Cunning Stunts?,"Sure this movie has a bunch of their songs, but they're all Live in Texas recorded on the same stage. The title completely doesn't go with the movie. I bought this movie because I thought it had live movies of them doing stunts for their movies, and/or some other things (which most of their other movies have) in different places, not a 140 minutes of a live concert on the same stage the whole time. So if you like their S&M movie, you'll probably like this one, too."
4,"Overall, a great performance....","I've never seen Metallica in concert before, so I thought watching this DVD would be a good way to see them. And believe me, I wasn't disappointed in the least bit! Jaymz and company are clearly enjoying themselves while at the same time making sure that the crowd was pumped up the whole time! The most memorable performance is ""Enter Sandman"" where part of the stage collapses because some guy decides to drop down from the top (via rope). And then there's ""One"" with the lights and explosions....The DVD in general is great. You have multiple angles for three of the songs where you can see each of the players from a different camera. Then there's some documentary footage and a photo gallery. My only problem is the gratuitous profanity (but then again, what do you expect from Metallica?). If you can get past that, ""Cunning Stunts"" is definitely worth viewing!"
5,metallica at its best,"this was the best metallica video i've seen out their! It by far has their best set including Feul, sad but true, So what, fade to black, i could go on forever it was so good. And if you buy it used you can pick it up pretty cheap. Definetly a Must have for metallica fans, you'd be robbing yourself if you didnt buy it also the fun goes on for over 3 hours. IS that great or what and even the second time it is still awsome, hell it gets better every time i watch it because you get to appreciate just how talented metallica is! Keep on Rockin and buy this video !"
3,Great with the exception of Hetfield's strained vocals,"Don't get me wrong I am a HUGE Metallica fan! The quality of this DVD is unmatched when compared with other music DVD's. The picture is phenominal. The sound is incredible. The camera work and behind the scenes footage makes this a fun DVD, but 5 stars? Too often Hetfield sounds strained when doing earlier material. He has lost that edgy sound in his voice. He can no longer pull it off live. Buy this DVD. It's awesome! Just don't expect the Hetfield of old. It becomes difficult to watch the DVD in one sitting, listening to Hetfield strain. That's why I give it 3 stars. Jason and Lars will bow your mind in this DVD. Enjoy."
1,Even Waterworld wasn't that bad!!!,"I rented this movie because of the cast which included the Michael Douglas, Frances McDormand, Tobey Maguire and Robert Downey JR. I am surprised today that all these famous (some award winners!) agreed to have their name attached to this movie. Problems with the movie are: 1- the characters are not likeable or dislikable enough for the viewer to care. 2- The story line does not make any sense. You follow these guys aimlessly plotting their way through nonsense!! 3- The actors looked like they did not care of how the movie would come out. I haven't seen bad acting like this in years. No wonder I never heard of this movie while it was in theatres!"
1,DONT EVEN THINK ABOUT TAKING THIS TRIP,"I RENTED WONDER BOYS AS PART OF OUR FRIDAY NIGHT AT THE MOVIES WITH SOME ANTICIPATION AS I HAD HEARD THAT IT WAS AMUSING AND FEATURED A TOUR DE FORCE PERFORMANCE BY MICHAEL DOUGLAS.NEITHER ASSUMPTION PROVED TO BE TRUE. I THINK THAT A MOVIE MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTER THAT THE AUDIENCE CARES ABOUT AND OR IDENTIFIES WITH.THIS MOVIE HAD NEITHER.THE SITUATIONS WERE INPROBABLE,RIDICULOUS ,AND JUST PLAIN NOT FUNNY.DOUGLAS'S PERFORMANCE WAS ONE DIMENSIONAL AT BEST,AND HIS RADICAL CHANGE AT THE END DEFIED CREDULITY.THE SAME CAN BE SAID FOR THE OTHER PERFORMERS.ESPECIALLY DISAPPOINTING WAS TOBEY MCGUIRE WHO AT BEST COULD BE DESCRIBED AS COMATOSE.WHAT WERE THEY THINKING ?19 MILLION IS TOO MUCH FOR THIS MOVIE .IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN TOTALLY IGNORED.AS MY WIFE SAID""IT IS THE WORST MOVIE I EVER WATCHED TO THE END"".SPARE YOURSELF DON'T WATCH."
2,bad,"This was a bad film. It's clear why the film didn't receive more notice from the Academy Awards. All it has going for it is a talented cast, and the ridiculous script irritates much more than entertains. The characters motivations are always questionable, although Michael Douglas is consistently likable. All in all, I think you'll find this movie is not as good as you thought it would be."
3,The Cast Keeps It Together,"I somewhat enjoyed this movie for the cast. The story started good, but seemed to fizzle out by the end. Although the story didn't play well, the interaction between the characters kept the movie going. Every actor (Douglas, Mcguire, Downey Jr and even Holmes) played their part extremely well and that's what kept me from shutting off the movie. Every character had an interesting background that the movie never really touched on. All and all, it was an okay movie."
1,Really dull,"I love the actors in this movie and was very excited to watch it. Unfortunately I found the plot dull. Maybe it was too ""deep"" for me. I thought the Michael Douglas Katie Holms student teacher thing would be more of a factor... but it was mostly about the Michael Douglas character (a successful writer who's teaching at a school and hasn't published a book in a long time) trying to help a very dark student writer (Tobey McGuire) who is very manipulative... Michael Douglas's publisher (Robert downey) shows up and is somewhat entertaining... but the relationships between the characters were just too odd for me to relate to. All the characters had such severe character flaws that they were just depressing to watch... there was no hero or heroine or any character I could remotely relate to. An aspiring writer might like this movie, but it was too strange for me."
1,One star too many,"Whether in voice-over or actually speaking, Michael Douglas' wooden, droning, unmodulated performance is not as animated as the ubiquitous monolith in 2001, a Space Odyssey. The actors and director must have been under some contractual obligation, for not since Steve Miller's ''Hearts Like a Wheel'' album of the late 70's has anything so horrible been released. To be fair, Frances McDormand was good. Robert Downey, Jr.'s camped-up, bug-eyed character was a little over the top, but his acting was at least on par with that of the baby McDormand carried in the final scene. Smarmy Tobey Maquire ruins every movie he's in. The only way this video will be worth the purchase price is if you open it and find instead ''Gladiator''."
4,Ballerina Jewelry Box,This jewelry box was not tacky or overly childlike; the box is a simple and a tasteful gift for a five year old or a teenager.
3,not worth 20$,This movie is not worth $20. it was funny at times but is a movie that you will only watch once. you are mutch better off renting it. it had some funny moments but was dragged out. definetly not worth 20 bucks.
2,A TV movie,"Good hearted, but not even close to the laughter level of the best the brothers have done... Amid all the freaks was the altered Cher supposed to be real?"
1,Not worth the trouble,I was hoping the ATD 8401 sandblaster would be a good unit for DIY projects. I didn't expect a professional unit but this one is not even good enough for a 1 star rating. The couplings are poorly engineered and break easily. I have a large Dewalt compressor which meets the specified requirements and have tried the finest sand but this tool simply won't feed the sand properly. I would have returned it but kept it too long before trying it. It's headed to the recycling center tomorrow... I don't ever want to see it again!
2,Washed out easy listening music,If you take away the vocals this could be the backing track for a Simply Red album. Texas are a talented group but this is a bit on the bland side
2,A good thing gone bad...,"I was blown away by th Rick's Road CD the band Texas released some years ago. With every new CD they've released I've been looking for that sound again, but have not found it. They get further and further away from what they're good at and have melded into the bland world of hip-hop pop where every song sounds the same. Far too bad! I miss the emotion and heavy drive of Rick's Road, one of the greatest CDs ever in my opinion."
3,Strays too far from its roots,"While on this side of the Atlantic there has not been great excitement about the forthcoming release of this album, some here were hoping for a return to blues-based rock 'n soul, not girl-group Motown pop. What came was submersion of the heart and spirit of the band to production values intent upon creating a new Sharleen, more chanteuse than rock 'n roller. Where is Ally's guitar when not trying to sound like ""Shaft""? Overall, the album is nondescript, lacking in edge, direction and distinction. Please give us more of Texas' voice and less pseudo-soul pop."
2,His ego trumps his good points,"Sportscaster Howard Cosell (1920-1995) was so annoying and obnoxious that millions of fans would turn off the sound on their TV sets. But away from the microphone Cosell was a capable print journalist who often wrote with great clarity and perspective. Here at his retirement Cosell writes about sports franchises relocating, problems within the NFL and boxing, sports announcers and Monday Night Football. Cosell makes several interesting points, but unfortunately his arrogance and ceaseless criticisms for his coworkers (and bragging about himself) was such a turnoff that I never finished these pages. If you found Cosell as perfect as he apparently did, you'll probably enjoy this book and the author's unbounded egotism."
2,Plain old timid organ music,"This title is a clean and crisp collection. It contains clever transcriptions of various works, but there is no attempt to exercise the organ with dynamic range (loud/soft) or voicing (choice and mixture of pipes). You will need to be a serious lover of organ music to stay awake and enjoy this."
5,"Good tips, astounding photos, clear maps, great book !","Me and my wife were able to follow about a dozen out of the 120 sugested road trips, in very diferent locations of USA (Florida, New England and California/Nevada/Arizona). This book prove to be a great guide for us because it shows really wonderful places, the way to get there and good tips. It was our one month best friend; even now I love to review its pictures, showing the beautiful places we did see and the ones we couldn't. The quality of the photographs is simply outstanding. We considered ourselves very lucky to find this book in the beginning of our trip. The best of all the three we had."
4,Wow!,"I ordered ""The most scenic drives in America: 120 spectacular road trips"" as a coffee table book. It has since served that job well along with being a great conversation starter."
4,Great Driving Tours,"Last year my wife and I took the Olympic Loop tour in the book. We added a side trip to Victoria Canada. The trip was fantastic and the book was very helpful. I used Google maps to figure out the distance and driving time between hotel stays, and I used the book to determine which sites to see. I recommend the book."
5,Very Colorful Coffee Table Book,"I received this book along withOff the Beaten Path: A Travel Guide to More Than 1000 Scenic and Interesting Places Still Uncrowded and Invitingas gifts. They are large, gloriously full color books, with heavy, semi-glossy paper. I found them full of useful information on places I never knew about...even in my current state and surrounding states.I had to return the orignal two I received because they were poorly packaged and the spines were torn and ruined on both by the time I received it. I must say, however, that Amazon gets 5 stars for customer service. The return was no cost to me and they even shipped new books right away rather than waiting to receive my damaged books. Sadly, the new books were shipped in poor packaging, too, but they weren't damaged."
4,Appreciated,Sent to son who is spending time in US for work and travelling round the coumtry and was a success.
5,Ready to hit the road!,"A friend loaned the book to me and after I started looking at it, I ordered it immediately. She has used it and said it was a great guide on the Natchez trip. Soon as the weather turns, we hit the road!"
5,Superb book to plan a scenic roadtrip,"This one is favorite travel book. Being an amateur photographer, I like to drive along the scenic drives, enjoy the spectacular views and capture them in my camera.This book will provide you:- The scenic drives and the key places on the route.- Tell the facts & specialties of the places.- What time of year is good to go.- Awesome pictures of the drives to motivate you to go there.- Contact numbers and information websites.- Information about side-trips.I will recommend to map out your route on Google Maps and do some search online for the side-trips before leaving. Some side-trips are not worth missing, so information-at-hand will help you to get there, w/o stopping anywhere to get local directions."
2,disapointed,Very Disappointed as I always am with Exhales DVD's. Its a shame b/c I am such a fan of there classes. If they could only create a dvd just like a class or what's done on yogavibes I feel they would have a great product. I just feel they try and make the dvd's to easy.
4,"A Little History, Professor...","I was interested about English history and this film, along with Elizabeth: The Golden Age, are great for understanding the beginning and continuance of the Elizabethan Age. Extremely well put together and superb acting make this film a keeper."
5,very pleased with the product,"the product was delivered on time, very good condition. There is nothing else that could have been done for more satisfaction."
3,"Well acted, but distorts the actual events","Elizabeth is a well acted and entertaining movie, with some very well done performances and is visually stunning. The problem is that the writers decided to change so many events, that it ends up unnecessarily distorting the actual history.To see a factual, well-acted, and still superb movie of the same era, get the 1971 film ""Mary Queen of Scots"" with Vanessa Redgrave. Not only does this follow the actual events, but the drama of 2 queens battling for power is so forcibly played that you can watch it over and over"
3,"Great movie, historical trash","This movie acurately captures the flavor of the times, but is historical nonsense. One of my ancestors, Robert Dudley, comes out looking like a wimp, and the end says Elizabeth NEVER saw him again in private! Nonsense. The Earl of Leicestor remained the queens favorate until he died. There is so much historically wrong with this movie that I almost didn't buy it. But, then, as a movie it IS good. The acting, photography, and sound is near perfect. The actions of ""Bloody Mary"" at the beginning are right-on. Just don't write an historical report on Elizabeth's life based upon it."
4,Bracingly Shakespearean.,"Ignore the fools who would dismiss this startling film over historical inaccuracies. As in a Shakespeare history play, 'history' is a background against which director Kapur frames his uncomfortable insights about power: the way it is based on god-like surveillance, murder, blasphemous invocations of religion etc.; and, more frighteningly, the way power is represented in art-forms, like masques, boat rides, costumes, the very images used in these artworks (e.g. the debate about the body and the body politic) - even, I guess, Shakespeare plays. And the best Shakespeare history plays were always about his present. Sometimes the film feels a little too CGI in its effects, but its mordant, violent and systematic cynicism makes it refreshing in a decade of limp costume dramas, and Geoffrey Rush once again proves why he is a titan among modern actors."
5,Excellent,The DVD of Elizabeth is wonderful. We really enjoyed the Director's commentary. I wish all DVD's had this feature. To watch the movie again with the director explaining things (some we never noticed) was incredible.
2,This movie remined me of a commercial,"Elzabeth was a compressed, and overly dramtic movei that lacked everything but attractive stars. The performance by Cate Blanchett would have been spectacular if she would have had any decent dialogue. The direction was horrible. How many times does the audiece want to see Elizabeth shot through a haze, or through a window shaped like a cross. This movie was worse than The Romeo and Juliet that came out with Claire Dnaes,"
4,"Excellent. great cast, costuming and props incrdible",I so enjoyed this movie that I purchased the Golden Age as well and find I can watch them both many times & find new things to enjoy with each viewing
3,As a film and British royal buff,"The movie gets 4 stars for entertainment value. It, however, is a historical piece, and as one that would be so widely viewed, they should have used less 'artistic license' for what was already a fascinating period. The aesthetic qualities of the film are excellent, no doubt, but often foray into some Vegas-style midieval fantasy. Kate Blanchett is a decent Elizabeth, but can not even come close to Glenda Jackson's spellbinding portrayal. Geoffrey Rush as Walshingham is good, but exaggerated. The rest of the cast is so laughably inaccurate, especially the Duc d'Anjou, Dudley and Cecil.Best way to watch this movie...clear your mind of any notion that the characters portrayed were in any way real historical figures!"
2,DISAPPOINTING ELIZABETH,"Elizabeth I's life and times were spectacular enough in truth to have made an excellent movie. However, the makers of ""Elizabeth"" saw fit to take thefacts of her reign, blend them together and spit out the facts at incorrect times. The movie does not depict events in logical sequence, and is sometimes confusing. I did think that Cate Blanchette did an excellent job of portraying the very complex Elizabeth. However, the scene toward the end of the movie when she cuts off her hair and dons white make-up was a farce. She wore white make-up to cover smallpox scars and old-age lines; she wore elaborate red wigs to cover her own thinning red hair. It was very misleading. See it for Cate Blanchette, but realize what you are seeing is inaccurate about the life of England's greatest monarch."
4,Great movie. Nice video even though DVD,"Even I bought the DVD, not Hi-Def, the video is vivid and bright. The audio was good.The movie itself is one of my best epic movie.Two thumbs up to actors and director."
2,Not history as we know it,"This film is beautifully produced, and Blanchett's performance--as well as those of other major cast members--is fine. However, the lack of historical accuracy in the film made it hard for me to watch--especially after having seen the brilliant Glenda Jackson mini-series. Surely there is more than enough accurate historical material on Elizabth I's life and times to obviate the need for so much invention or omission."
2,"All a bit much, really","As Elizabeth I, Cate Blanchett is, of course, extraordinary. As a visual extravaganza, the film is lush and dramatic. And yet, the overall effect is rather wearying. The director uses a pretty heavy hand, especially when it comes to the score. He also manages to make the drama of Elizabeth's early life, which hardly needs any embellishment, seem unlikely. I don't mind loose treatment of factual events if used in service to the story, but this film was loose in tone, so that it was hard to believe that these were Elizabethan men and women, rather than actors in rich costumes. This is filmmaking as music video instead of filmmaking as storytelling."
1,Elizabeth,"This movie is fine if all you want is a costumed drama, but since I've very familiar with the actual history, I found the liberties taken with historical fact absolutely unconscionable. If Elizabeth I were alive today, she could sue for libel. Go back to Glenda Jackson for real historical drama."
2,Don't Bother,"This film only merits two stars to give credit to the costume and set designers. The rest is pure trash. The script sounds like it was written by a bad romance novelist and the historical inaccuracies are amazing. The characters are pure stereotype. If you are intersted in a dramatization of Elizabeth's life you would be better off going to the old ""Elizabeth"" series with Glenda Jackson. Even the 70's movie ""Mary, Queen of Scots"" does a better job with the same material."
2,could have been better.,Movie lost me about half way in. Not because it was confusing it just wasn't a film that grabbed and kept your attention. The costumes and scenery were nice but the film just failed at keeping your attention. Also from what I read it had a fair share of historical inaccuracies.
4,Elizabeth is Nearly Accurate Historically,"Elizabeth is a great movie which accommodates both the world of facts and history with the world of entertainment and Hollywood. The movie is a relatively accurate historically, but overall it focuses on the way it really was back then and is an exciting film."
2,GREAT CAST AND HISTORY WASTED...,"Great cast and history were wasted the the director's heavy hand in conducting this movie. THe narrative is slow and boring, although the general plot is so good. Sad.."
5,Live version of Please is amazing.,"This album and live version also contain a solo by Edge not on Pop which takes this song over the top. One of U2's most underrated songs. If you like the album version, you must buy this cd, and if you dont like the album version, you may want to give the live one a second look."
1,Great music ruined by poor production values,"I have to agree with a previous reviewer regarding the vocal quality on this CD...it's abysmal. The harmonies on the original albums don't get a chance to shine with the muddied vocals on this CD. I'm glad to have a CD version of these two albums, as mine are pretty scratchy, but i'll still play the vinyl when i really want to hear the Talbots at their best. If you somehow have the albums in good shape after all these years, don't buy the CD...you'll probably be disappointed at the sound quality. But the CD is definitely worth having if you don't have the albums. Mason Proffit was one of the best concert bands of the early seventies, especially in small venues like the basement of River City in Iowa City in 1972. If you never heard them, and you want to hear some ""down-home"" music from that era, you can't go wrong with these guys."
5,Enjoyable Characters,"After a crazy week with too much to do, I picked up The Penalty Box on my way home from a workshop I was teaching. I needed something to read that would be light and refreshing. With a husband who coaches youth hockey, I thoroughly enjoyed the theme and the comparisions. Deirdre was on target with her hockey information. The main character, Katie, was a delight with a wonderful sense of humor that had me chuckling time and again and she suffers from something most women do--trying to keep the weight off. Most of us can connect to Katie's plight. This is the first book I've read by this author, however, I plan to read her other ones. This was such a fun read on a wintry night."
4,i like purple people tho' depressing,i luv spark. it grows on you. it's different from previous tori amos releases.
5,A good edition to the series,"When Jade's parents got married they're marriage was more like a buisness partnership. Everything was divided down the middle just in case anything ever happened. And when they had Jade they couldn't divide her. When it comes time for Jade to tell her story in Dr. Marlowe's therapy session, she dosen't want to speak. But when she dose she spins a story of a terrible battle masked by a privileged life. When Jade's parents got divorced they fought over her not becasuse they loved her, but becasue they wanted to come out on top. Will Jade be able to deal with everything? Or will she fall apart.I really liked this book it's a good edition to the series and so far my favroite. I've already read Misty the first one and I'll be sure to read Cat and Star. This is an interesting series and I reccomend it to fans on suspenceful real life novels. I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
1,Not a fan,I bought this CD for a special event. I had never heard Hungarian music before. The only thing I can compare it to is fingernails on a chalkboard.
2,"Frothy and Sparkling as Champagne, but no there there.","Everyone must love the word play, the costumes, the energy, the sets, the feel of this movie. It is fine entertainment. The actors are all having a great deal of fun.But it's like watching cotton candy. It's all sugar and spice, but no substance. In particular, there is no sense at all that this is a film about *Shakespeare*. A film about his plays, yes. But this Shakespeare does not remotely approach the genius we see in the plays. And that's too bad, really, because any film that could capture *that* would be a film worth watching again and again."
4,"Not what i thought, but better than imagined","This film is classic Shakespeare in a modern tongue to keep the 20 and 21 century man or woman on the end of their seat for love, fantasy, humor and drama.I didn't see the film on the theater because I have not been an overall fan of the main actress, however when pushed a bit to view it at home on DVD, I found that not only was I surprised at the content and the elegance of its' filmaking, I found I have continued to watch it several times over.I don't know if it's a mixture of the romance, the humor or the quick wit of Shakespeares' writing or the beauty of the filmaking, but I find myself gravitate towards it every so often and watch it religiously when it appears on cable. I am not one to watch these types of movies but the old tale in a new way keeps it intersting and moving right along.I would reccommend it for a home collection whole heartily."
4,Yup,"Well, Joseph Fiennes and Colin Firth may be sexy as but that doesn't hide the fact that this movie is simply Romeo and Juliet all over again. Oh and that Gwyneth Paltrow did not deserve that oscar, cate blanchett was a million times better in Elizabeth. Anyhoo, who likes Clark Gable here?"
2,A bore.,"I found this movie to be a bore. It was overacted and it tried too hard to be funny. Paltrow is so awfully boring. If you want to see a real film, check out ""Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead"". Oldman and Roth make an outstanding team. Imagine looking at the ""Hamlet"" story through the eyes of two of it's mere sidemen. Wonderful!"
1,This movie is way overrated ...,"George C. Scott, who recently passed away maintained that OSCARS are not always awarded on the basis of actual merit. This movie proves that notion."
3,It was okay.,"I can't say that I was really that impressed with this film. It no doubt was well made and the acting was fine, but it wasn't very exciting or that engaging. It was also a bit boring too. I'm also surprised that this picture won an award that Saving Private Ryan clearly deserved. Saving Private Ryan is a much better movie than Shakespeare in Love in my opinion. This movie was okay, but surely not a classic."
1,DREADFULLY HORRIBLE,"This movie is boring, stupid, horrible acting, gwynth acting is horrible, and COMPLETLEY missleading. The ONE thing i liked about this movie was the costumes. I had to fast forward through SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO many parts in this movie because they were boring, pointless, pathetic or a combonation of all of them.There is absolutely no point to this movie whatsoever. Don't waste your time with this boring movie."
2,Kind of disappointed!!!,"I thought the movie will be so much better, I had red the great reviews about it and I was very disappointed by this movie ""Shakespeare in Love"", it was most of the time very boring. The only thing I like was the beautiful costumes, dresses and atmophere of the moive but for the script it was pretty bad.When Gwenette Paltrow play Romeo she can't fool anybody and when she was acting it was pretty bad her voice had no tonation and was bad. She look fabulous in her beautiful dresses that's what was good about her, her acting was not great, just okay. I usually like her she is a good actress but this time her acting was boring.Also seeying all the time Shakespeare and her in bed reciting some part of the play was boring and sometime they both get really much in my nerves.I don't say don't rent the movie, you may like it, it was not that bad but I was pretty disappointed by it, I thought it will be much better!"
1,Surprisingly Disappointing,"I was anxious to see this movie, considering the great reviews it received. I was very disappointed while watching, wondering halfway through if I should turn it off or if it might possibly get better. I wanted to watch the movie in its entirety so I could judge it fairly.The acting, although there were good actors involved, was quite bad. I was also disappointed because there was so much that seemed to be good about the story when I read brief clips about the film. I would not recommend seeing this movie."
4,Pretty good,"This is a very intelligent film, and it's entertaining. However, I don't think it deserved Best Picture. Additionally, Shakespeare, and Viola spent a little TOO much time making out etc. Other than that, it was a wonderful film"
3,"Clever, witty, enjoyable, but Best Picture?","I enjoyed this movie very much. It was very funny and witty, and clever, too. I thought Gweneth Paltrow gave a pretty good performance. She was very graceful and emotional, and she and Joseph Fiennes have great chemistry. Fiennes was great at portraying the smitten Shakespaere, and Judi Dench and Geofferey Rush are very funny and lighten things up. Though this is the only Oscar-nominated film I saw (Didn't see Saving Private Ryan, Life is Beautiful, ELizabeth, etc.), I wonder just why this movie won Best Picture. It was very light, not deep at all. It wasn't a ""great artistic achievement"", and isn't that what the Oscars are given to? Still, that doesn't mean you shouldn't see it. You'll enjoy yourself immensly but probably, like me, wonder why it won the Best Picture Oscar."
5,Great,You would want to be into learning a bit more about Elizabethan England and about Shakespeare. I love this movie so much!!!!!
5,The DVD was given as a gift for my daughter,"The DVD was given as a gift for my daughter. She said it arrived on time and as of today, she has not watched this movie."
1,Shakespeare in Love (Miramax Collector's Series),"Not impressed. Bought this as a gift for someone and they lent it back to me to watch. Wasted my time and money, but the person who I gave it to was ok with it."
5,if you have any theater experience,It has a great pace and a great turn of phrase. If you have any theater experience at all you will be in on the jokes. It makes one appreciate good acting from great acting. Their perfomances pull you in even when they are acting at acting.
3,Not Oscar Material.,"This movie is really just a good romantic comedy. It lost the oscar, of course, to Saving Private Ryan, which wasn't as pretty or funny.Gwyneth Paltrow revises the role she's played many times before- pretty, rich girl (with fake British accent)and Judy Dench again plays the crochety older woman, though to be fair this time she is also Queen Elizabeth.It's not a bad movie, and it's not badly acted, but it doesn't really say anything, except maybe that love is nice, or painful, or fleeting. And that's okay- but a movie that wins the best picture award should be much better than nice, funny and pretty."
4,"Flicka, Ricka, Dicka Bake a Cake","A simple story about a simple activity (baking a birthday cake for mother) that my children and their friends have enjoyed for several years. They repeatedly ask for me to read this book. The underlying messages in all the Flicka, Ricka and Dicka books (as well as the Snipp, Snapp, Snurr stories) encourage kindness to others and responsiblity. Not inspiring literature but a great book about somthing young children are interested in."
1,bad service - decpetive sales,"This company is not interested in fixing a problem. They send out white strobes when you think you are getting red. Then when you complain they say too bad. The white ones cannot be seen in fog, while the red does well. Want your money back - not a chance. want the red one instead - not a chance.Don't do business with this company. Not even Amazon is willing to fix the problem. They say just send feedback. So here it is. Thumbs down, way down."
4,Nice Job,Nice job with the behind the scenes prior to the Strange Behavior Tour in '87. One thing that I felt it lacked was more music.
2,D Ratnayake,I thought this would blend well with HO track bed. But there does seem to be a bit of a hight difference and flexibility issue.
4,try whistling this!,"I bought ""best of crowded house"" and i love that cd! When i heard this album the first time, i wasn`t overwhelmed, but after a few more listenings i found my favourite tracks; ""last one standing"", ""she will have her way, ""faster than ligth"", ""sinner"" and ""truth"" which i think is wonderful.(Noone ever mentioned this track) NF is a good singer too, and i hope he will continue his work, and keep his talent alive!"
5,The Embodiment of Creativity,"As Neil Finn's solo debut, ""Try Whistling This"" is a great listen on a rainy night. It is amazing to me that he isn't more popular in the US. His history of songwriting has lifted him as one of the best. I never tire of his songs, and can listen from front-to-back without skipping even one tune. The songs on ""TWT"" are intense and defeated; soft and reasurring, all in one neat package.Listen for ""Sinner"" - great cynical lyrics and a terrific backbeat."
1,ONE OF THE ALL TIME WORST MOVIES I'VE EVER SEEN!!!,"I find it difficult to believe that anyone in their right mind would find this movie entertaining. You couldn't pay me to watch it again. It has no story, no plot, and no dialogue worth listening to. It is a huge zero with nothing worthwhile to offer. Actually, it is below zero...way below! I liked Johnny Depp in ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" but after seeing him in this piece of crap, I will never watch anything he does in the future as he has proven to me that I can not trust in his judgement to choose a decent script. There are so many good videos available, don't waste your time on a garbage movie like this one!"
1,Huh?,"Well, maybe it's just me, but i couldn't see any plot whatsoever in the movie. You know, that little thing usually included in the movie that makes the movie worthwhile. So anyway i was watching it and nothing at all happened in the first hour or something (time moves so slow when youre bored). It was like an entire first part of the movie on an acid trip and that got old fast. So i turned it off and rewound it and went outside and that was more entertaining than the movie."
5,Awesome!,"I didn't notice when i purchased it, but for the blu-ray version, all German cover and German dub seems to be the default sound and subtitle, though it does come with English DTS HighRes 5.1 sound and English subtitles, but the title menu will not change to English. None the less a GREAT movie!"
3,Nice visuals,"This story has been described as an exploration of ""the death of the most idealistic decade and generation."" However, far from illuminating the likely fascinating question of why the idealism of the 1960s hit the ""high water mark"" and then receeded (as Thompson, ably acted by Depp, muses in one all-too-brief lucid moment), this story simply presents the story of two self centered idiots with an evident lack of concern for anyone besides themselves. Perhaps they are meant to embody the worst qualities of people, to show what brought down the 1960s idealism, but if so that was never conveyed by the story. To its credit, the visual style of the film is a nonstop head trip, which will remind pretty much everyone of their college days...and may make you wonder what was so special about Thompson's that it warranted a film. Was he only famous for being infamous? You'll have to actually read something by him to find out, because this film sure doesn't tell."
4,Great movie,The movie is one of my favs. But i am reviewing the product. The blu-ray version is pretty good. I am very pleased with the transfer. The sound could have been better. All in all a great purchase.
5,"Bad craziness, Savage vibrations....","Mother-of-sweating-Jesus! What does it all mean? Does it even matter? Like it or don't like it, your opinion has no worth to me at all. This bit of film is without any doubt the best adaptation of a book I have ever seen, almost a direct translation. And the book it is based on is too well done to be understood. Somehow though, it all works itself into a five star rating. It makes about as much sense as this review, which I am hoping is weird and confusing. And your ax never did tell me where the bathroom was...."
1,"Now this is a bad trip! - Grotesque, not funny","I bought this after reading the reviews here. To make a long story short, it's the only DVD I 'm considering throwing on the trash can. I have more than 90, from all genres, and never felt this idiot before. The film is ridiculous, the acting is grotesque, I can't believe it gives pleasure to anyone. It's worst than many summer comedies, because it tries to be ""cult"". Everything is so overacted and predictable that I didn't even smile once while watching it. As for the DVD only, it's normal, no valuable extras (if only this was possible with such a movie). The Amazon ranking was one of my guides for movies. After this bad trip I'll consider more before buying."
1,"Horrible, slow, boring film","This movie is horrible, don't waste your time or money. I turned it off at 20 minutes. I like Johnny Depp, but his character in this movie is very irritating. I couldn't stand the monotone voice overs and the constant paranoia; it wasn't funny at all. What do people see in this movie?I read some reviews comparing it to Fight club or American Beauty. NO WAY! Those movies were stimulating and entertaining. Fear and Loathing is a dud."
2,A poor adaptation of a good book,"This, as many before me have cited, is probably one of those stories that should never have left the stark pages of a book. It's nearly impossible to turn a drug trip into something you can actually film, but success is not impossible. Just look at ""Trainspotting.""The book is good. Not great, but it does leave a resounding feeling behind, which is, for the book, the way to go. You're left with questions, fears, and some wicked humor.As a movie however, the compelling story is reduced to a cheap, Halloween party. People parade around in stupid costumes, making you wonder ""am i laughing at Johnny Depps performance, or the foam rubber lizard next to him?"" It's something you just can't help but feel sad for: ""This could have been so much more...""The sole reason to see this movie: Johnny Depp. His performance is good, is an insane way. Just don't go see this if it's high-class humor you're after."
2,Unengaging.,"I am a person of sound mind and wit. I did not like this film one bit. There was not anything about it that I found particularly memorable, I disliked the characters immensely, it all seemed like an overscripted drama at a nearby theater. This film is considered as a cult classic and yet I happen to be of the cult that doesn't quite dig this. Johnny Depp is one of the most over-rated actors in the industry. I can't help but blame him for how lackluster and robotic his acting made this. I do not recommend this film at all.The Blu Ray probably has a better detail level so when the actors are tripping on dinosaurs and dim lights, there is better detail to zero in on how boring the film really was. I'm a big White Rabbit fan but they ruined the song in this unfunny roller-coaster."
5,Breathtakingly Honest,"To the typical viewer, this movie is just a wacky comedy with drugs, foul language, and Johnny Depp.However, to the serious movie connoisseur, this is an amazing exploration of an era almost forgotten by society and time. The way it portrays two typical 70's hippies is perfect, right down to the copious amounts of drugs they use.Johnny Depp also does a breathtaking performance as American journalist Hunter S. Thompson, perfecting the man's mannerisms and odd sense of style.This is definitely one of the best adaptations of a novel to ever be made, and is worth watching if you want a hilarious and heartwarming story filled with great acting and stunning visual effects."
4,The most literal translation of book to film,"By professional critical standards, there's probably not many redeeming qualities this movie possesses. There's not really a story, no motive to propel these characters onward, and there's no moral tied up in a bow at the end. However, this is the most literal translation of a novel to film that I have seen, and it's one hell of a ride. Johnny Depp is outstanding as Hunter S. Thompson/Raul Duke, complete with crippling paranoia and hand gestures. As usual Benicio Del Toro is great, and the revolving cast of thousands never tries to steal the show. The movie slows down during the second half, but it doesn't diminish the fun that derives from watching these fictional (?) exploits. If you want a fun movie you don't have to think about, you may have found your match."
5,True to Gonzo journalism,"I dont understand how most of the critics hated this movie. In fact the late Gene Siskel is the only one i know who like it. Maybe its because the story dosnt have any real moral or message in it, just like the book it only reports what happens to these two fools. In fact this is one of the realist movies I've ever seen in the way that the plot unfolds and how the characters react to each situation with a twisted mind. The only thing i can find wrong with the movie is that the sound is rather dull, I have to turn the volume on my TV about all the way up before i can really hear anything."
5,One I can watch over and over,When this movie first came out it got such lousy reviews I didn't watch it at first but did end up renting it. It has now become one of my favorites
1,repetitive/dull,"Someone I know once told me this film is brilliant and I had to see it. I had my doubts... the haze of drug-addled minds and the chaos of long, drugged-up scenes in no way appeals to me. I approached this film with a cautious but open mind. I did manage to get through the film in which Johnny Depp and Benicio del Toro are both brilliant. Still, the story in no way interested me. That is not to say it would not be entertaining for some people who enjoy this kind of ""storytelling"". The drugs, after all, are integral to the story and how events played out. Watching, though, makes me rather... ill. In light of Hunter S. Thompson's recent suicide, I would suggest that interested parties read his works rather than watch this. Maybe you have to be on drugs yourself (or incredibly... imaginative?) to enjoy this fully."
2,What a waste,"God, what a cult film that doesn't deserve it's status. A few friends of mine clamored over this, saying ""dude, you have to see it, it's freaking great"". For the first 20 minutes, I was right there with them. Great visuals, rolling into Vegas and whatnot. Then they tripped out. Again. And again. And again. And it's not funny. We're just as bored and confused as the characters, sitting in their hotel rooms, trying to guess what they did. Wow, that's a great way to spend 2 hours. A lot of people love this for the drugs, and well, if you're into that you'll probably enjoy it too. If you like to pretend your into it, it'll be even greater for you.The only thing that saves this from a 1 star rating is Depp's performance, who I must say atleast narrates well."
1,Stick with the book,"I bought and read the book after the movie came out. I loved it and couldn't wait to see the movie. Then I saw the movie. I know the movie never meets the expectation after a book, but I really didn't see a shaved head Depp when I read the book. The lines come from the book, but they sounded very forced or fake to me. Maybe it was because the best parts of the book come from what's going on in his mind, and that is hard to translate to a movie. I wanted to love this movie, but I have to admit I never finished it."
1,What the F@#%!,"I don't understand how ANYONE could like this movie! It'a a pointless, excruciating, overlong, painful, acid trip. I would have rather watched paint dry."
1,Loathsome,"A film without plot or dramatic tension, with two forgettable (however deplorable) one-note leads (the rest broad caricatures unworthy of a seven year-old), some faintly memorable minor moments but not one memorable or sustained scene. The main appeal here, far as I can see, is that of a film that glorifies mindlessness while making dumb people feel superior by comparison. But not a single authentic note struck throughout. A silly flat cartoon: seventies gonzo seen through the eyes of Hollywood brats."
2,Great Video Quality,"Please describe the audio and video quality of any Blu-Ray you review. Thanks to those who do this.The video quality of this Blu-Ray is excellent. I give it a 10.0 out of 10. I did not see any grain at all. Audio is DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, which was okay, not outstanding. There just wasn't much sound out of the surrounds.This has to be one of the worst, and most boring movies I have ever seen. I was just not into it, but finished watching it anyway."
5,Great psychadelic experience,Fear and Loathing makes the use of drugs absolutely unnecessary! You get stoned by only watching this film and if you have ever had any acid-trips in your life you will definetely get an enormous feeling of deja-vu when stumbling through Las Vegas together with Raul Duke! This is much more fun and a lot easier than any psychadelic experience in your life! BUT REMEMBER: IT IS JUST A MOVIE and DON'T TRY THIS AT HOME!
5,Hallucinatory Highway Hijinks!!!,"I LOVED this film! Johnny Depp gives yet another brilliant performance as journalist Hunter Thompson, and Bencio del Toro is also excellent,leaving whatever hearthrob image he had behind as a bloated drug addled lawyer/sidekick. The director does a great job of bringing Thompson's novel to life with outrageous visuals, and special effects. This movie is incredibly funny and one you won't get tired of after repeated viewing. I read the book after I watched the film and it definatley stays true to the novel even using whole paragraphs as dialogue. This film turned me onto the writings of Hunter Thompson who is possibly the coolest writer on the planet. I say buy this film and check out the book as well!!"
3,the up in smoke of halucenogenic movies,"johnny depp and his lawyer stay trashed on a plethora of halucenogenics for 2 hours.chances are your kids wont know what the hell is even happening.it is very funny but strange as can be.they take acid,shrooms,ether etc and get into a lot of wild situations.johnny depp has done better but this one far outweighs a lot of his stuff."
4,True fan,"Say what you will about how the movie was made, it is one of the few movies that holds true to the book (yes, it was a book first) Hunter Thompson's brief cameo alone is a good enough stamp of approval for me."
1,WACK!!!!!!!,this is the wackest song ever!!! i have never heard wacker s*** in my life. I wish DMX and Nas would just clap punks like Wycleff and Puff down.
3,just Ok!,This didn't go as well as I hoped with my daughter! she prefers to practice on real clothes. Button is too hard for her little fingers. Looking back I probably wouldn't have bought it.
2,not practical,"the fact that each task was a was a puzzle as well detracted from it's appeal. The pieces came out and were not as ""usable"" because they came out. Would have been better if it was one solid board with tasks to perform on it."
2,TOO FRUSTRATING FOR A THREE YEAR OLD,"Buttons, tongues, snaps....too small, too tight, needing too much strength. If I barely have the strength, how can a three year old? She gave it a once over and no longer plays with it."
1,Would be great if the pieces were attached.,"I love the quality of Melissa and Doug products, but they didnt quite think this one through. It is quite difficult for me, yet alone my toddler to use this because the pieces are not stationary, Like other reviews will probably glue them down to me good use of it."
3,So so,I like the idea just not the execution.my son is 16 mths old and loves the snap one but they get lost...I just would prefer if I could attach them to the board.
3,Neat concept!,"I had always heard M&D items were good quality but I bought this and the other basic skills puzzle board and this one the paper is pealing up on a couple pieces and I noticed this before my daughter ever touched it so I am concerned how long it will last, plan to re-glue this week. The other puzzle has latches and one of the doors doesn't open without a little force and that's difficult for my daughter, will have to sand down an edge on that one. I don't like having to fix toys before use, especially puzzles that cost $15 a piece. I do however like the concept and my daughter seems to really enjoy them which is why I gave it 3 stars."
2,Disappointed,"So typically Melissa and Doug toys are great. I was pretty disappointed with this purchase. The closures are not easily manipulated because of the size. Zipper is too chunky, laces are to thick to tie well, buckle is WAY to hard to un-buckle(might loosen with time), flap for the button is to short...Pretty bummed overall. Its not going to break anytime soon though cause we don't play with it. :{"
1,negative,Put the pump in the truck and it worked fine. We drove the truck approx. 200 miles and the pump quit and left us stranded.
3,Some nice songs but overall disappointing,"Basically, this is a collection of Irving Berlin songs. The plot (if you can call it that) adds nothing. The songs are well sung. This would have been a more enjoyable DVD if they had eliminated the story and simply presented a concert of the songs, replacing the dialog with more songs. However, since the price of this DVD is less than most CDs, I suppose one shouldn't complain too much."
2,Hollywood's Ragpickin' Band,"I was disappointed by this film. Tyrone Power, who is apparently devoid of musical talent, portrays a bandleader. Alice Faye, who can't carry a tune, is his Chantoozie. Ethel Merman, the one singer in the cast, never got to sing the title song! In later years she made it famous, probably to stick a finger in the eye of the producer. When ""Alex"" takes his band to Carnagie Hall in 1938, it is three times the size of the actual Benny Goodman orchestra that played the real gig the movie copies. Perhaps the saddest scenes of all are when Alex Haley, a decent hoofer, has to pretend to be a drummer. Good thing the beat was faster than his sticks! The one saving grace of the film is it was shot close to the period it portrays - so at least they got that right!"
2,Kautzky's Ways with Watercolor,"I found the prints excesively dark, specially the black and white ones and the color plates didn't offer enough variations of tones. Overall his paintings looked quite uniform."
2,Ways with Watercolor Ted Kautsky,"I was very disappointed in the content. There were not enough color plates and transparency in the color was lacking. Many of the instructions were used with black and white sketches and plates. Many of Kautskys subjects and scenes appeared to me to be ""pre watercolor career"" pencil sketches which I recognized.Dark somber and sparse in my opinion."
5,Lee pulls out all the stops on this one,"RECITAL is Lee Michaels second album, released on vinyl as A&M SP 4152. There are still some guitar solos, but this time out Lee is in the foreground playing harpsichord, organ and piano while belting out blues vocals with uptempo percussion. ""Spare Change"" is an instrumental experiment which is fascinating. Other great cuts are ""The War,"" ""Grocery Soldier"" and ""If I Lose You."" This one was more of a critical than commercial success, but definitely worthwhile."
3,NBA Street V3,"This game just let me down. I was glad when I rented this because NBA Street V3 is too short. It took me two days to finish with full stats on my character, all the basketball ledgends... oh that is it. See it is very short. Please rent this. dont even buy it used.( ARG. No Gamebreaker level 3 which is another dissapointment.)"
3,NBA Street 3,"I ordered this game by mistake, but kept it anyway and gave it as a Christmas gift. The person who got it says the game is fun."
4,Amazing,"Geoff Keezer is a very special artist. Your music is magnific, and the participation of Diana Krall make this album essencial for the lovers of jazz"
3,Fans of Miss Marple may be disappointed.,"This book is a page turner, but Miss Marple's contributions to the solution of the mystery seem to be incidental. As with Christie's later books (the 60s +) I wasn't all that surprised by its resolution. For Miss Marple at her best, try ""The Body In The Library"" or ""Murder At The Vicarage""."
3,Predictable,I have read many of Agatha Christie's books and although it isn't my favorite it isn't my least favorite. I figured it out pretty early and I'm certainly no genius!
3,Pfffft,"It took quite a while for this item to ship, I practically had finished the game before it was sent to me. Also upon receiving this product i noticed quite a number of rips and tears and most of the pages had folds. Of course everything was there but the condition wasn't as good as advertised."
4,Was on the look for this for quite awhile.,"Saw Lee Michaels w/Frosty live at Winterland in SF, years ago. Opened for Santana, I believe. Outstanding performance!!!!! This CD is great, the sound is crisp and clean. Great songs. Could do without the drum solo, but it's a small price to pay for the rest of the music."
1,Not worth the money,"I purchased ""WR in a Hurry' because I needed to add an automation language to my reportoire. The book is a dud: definitely not worth the money. It has kind of a ""See Spot. See Spot run."" flavor to it. While the book will give you the ABCs of WR (how to install, how to open), it does not get to the CDEs, much less the XYZs, of the tool. You'd be better off searching the web for a tutorial."
1,Awful Book.,Going through the tutorial that came with the WinRunner CD is 100 times more helpful than this book. Do not make the mistake of buying it as I did.
5,Super Funny,This show is awesome. It is consistently entertaining and funny. I wish I started watching this show when it first came out. I LOVE it and so does my husband! We have been telling everyone we know to watch the show if they don't already.
2,Meh...,"It typically takes a comedy a few episodes to find its voice, but I think this one found it and then lost it. The high point for me was the first season episode where the gang enables underage drinking and tries to relive high school as ""cool kids"" rather than losers. This episode was disturbing, complex and very funny. When Danny DeVito comes on board, the show quickly devolves into lots and lots of shouting matches as a substitute for comedy (not DeVito's fault, but more a problem with the writing). Too bad. I give the first disc three and a half stars, but the second one is hard to watch - hence the two stars."
5,Brilliant Show!,"This is a great show that everyone needs to catch on to! New episodes are on FX Thursday nights at 10. Season 1 features some of their most brilliant writing, taking on social issues like Gun Control and Racism and turning them into hilarious plot lines, with the Gang always making sure they are being ""PC"" while acting like complete idiots. The introduction of Danny Devito in Season 2 adds a whole new dimension, as he tries to become ""one of the boys"" and takes on the role of ringleader, coming up with even more bizzare and irrational plots. The raunchy humor and spot-on portrayal of a group of 20-something jerks with no real direction in life makes this an amazing show. Season 1 will no doubt turn you on to this awesome comedy."
5,Sunny on DVD- It's About Time,"If you're a Sunnyfan, you know. Otherwise, I can't tell you how long I have been waiting for this. Possibly the greatest live-action comedy since Seinfeld and Arrested Development (RIP), this is irreverent, dark, American self-indulgence at its best, which is actually probably its worst. If you're not laughing after you buy this, you're either dead, or maybe you should go ahead and off yourself, because...well...just because.Enjoi."
5,Best Comedy on TV,Without a doubt the funniest show on TV. The DVD box set contains all 17 episodes of the first two seasons. There are nice extras like cast commentaries and outakes as well as a couple short documentaries. Let's hope this is just the first of many many more seasons of SUNNY to be released on DVD. This show is something very rare: a TV sitcom that is actually funny.
5,Hilarious,"Great show, even before Danny Devito joined the cast. You're missing out if you haven't seen this!"
3,SILLY BUT AMUSING,What more can be said? It's about ridiculous one dimensional characters in ridiculous situations and entire cast is unaware. After awhile it becomes repeative and I'm not going to watch it further. This was enough.
1,crushed seeds,My order arrived a lot sooner then I expected but the seeds came crushed and unusable. The seed jacket had some sort of oil on it. The envelope was marked do not crush so I really don't know whose fault it was the company or the mail carrier. I am very disappointed.
1,Not worth the money,"No developement of plot or characters. Some of the dialogue about how sex is performed is taken almost word for word from some of her other books. Instead of one villian, there are three, which is two too many for this story. I didn't care what happened to any of the characters. No fire, no sizzle, just blah."
1,Please don't waste your time,"This is one of the worst books that I've read. The characters are lifeless. The dialogue among them is dull and illogical. The relationships between the characters seem rushed and unexplainable. I could not see where the ""love"" developed between the main couple. The sexual relationships were not romantic and were very boring. It was like reading a textbook, with the heroine asking ""what's this"" kind of questions."
4,Mary,Track #12 (Mary); positively sublime and better voice sound than is likely to be heard anywhere. Unsurpassed lyrics; a treasure!
5,I am a newfound fan!,"I had never in my life heard of Patty Griffin until I saw the commercial for MXG ONLINE. I heard the song ""Blue Sky"" on the commercial and HAD to know who sang it. I did a lot of research and finally found out who sang the awesome song. I am a singer myself so it looks like I've found a new inspiration."
2,A big disappointment.,"""Living With Ghosts"" was such a great album that this followup is a huge disappointment. Many of the songs are just loud and distorted."
2,Disappointing,"Not what I thought it would be. This is not the real Patty Griffin. This may be her wild side, but not nearly as attractive as her reflective stuff."
2,Flaming ripoff,"...of PJ Harvey, but I suppose imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. I'll stick to the real thing, thanks."
5,Very very nice book,"I loved this book. Good to read, good examples and funny.It's a very nice way to understand more about economics not being an economist."
3,good book for a high schooler or undergrad,"I have an MBA and wanted to refresh my knowledge of econ theories and important authors. This book is an easy overview of what you need to know to get started in Econ, it doesn't helps you get a grasp on Econ Theories. It is also cluttered by the author conservative opinion, I was looking for the raw stuff just like I had it when I was in school, this book didn't do the job. Good beach reading not a classroom one."
5,Naked Economics.,"Naked Economics was a joy to read. The author wrote in a way as if he was speaking and due to that, the readings went by very quickly. Also, the author related things to his readers, which was nice since economics can sometimes seem so abstract. I highly recommended this book."
4,"Good basics, but most surely written by a Right-Wing Econ Guy","It's a good book for some (very opininated) basics on Econ. This book will make any left-wingers bristle from some of the callus things he says about trade and/or sweatshops.Nonetheless, if you want to understand the underlying principles of Econ, this is a good book to add to your library. Just make sure to read this with a grain of salt, and maybe offset his opinions with something from the other side of the political fence."
3,good books,"it is a ok book, the first few chapters are good, but nothing new. the last chapter about development economics is a complete failure.I assume the author is fully aware the development stragety of Britian, America, Germany, Japan and China, at this point he is not honest, pray, which country put property right or IP on their agenda when theywere trying to steal other countries' technology?I burst into laugh when he discribed a Chinese student in Nanjing University to ask to implement a similar government in Beijing like Washington, from Korean war, Vietnam wars to Gulf wars, Irap wars, Aufganstian wars, the author can simply tell the girl: you have a better government than we got in U.S, you have nothing to envy , haha3 stars."
5,Great Book - Insightful and Easy-to-Understand Info on Incentives,"This is the best book on economics I've ever read. I have a double major in finance and entrepreneurship, so I've taken a wide range of economics courses and read many economics books for school, work, and personal education.This is by far the best I've read. He actually makes economics interesting and provides useful info to the every-day person."
4,Good reading even for a textbook!,Good reading even for a textbook! I used it for a Senior High School level course and it was very good.
4,Good,"This is my favorite book on the subject of economics. Wheelan strives to demonstrate how economics can explain a lot about the world we live in. This book is down to earth, filled with familiar examples, and defiantly not stuffed with econo-jumble. This book is by no means perfect but it deffently tops my list for readable books on the subject."
5,Classic France,"A beautifully rendered instrumental evocative of the best of France for the romantic at heart. If your recollections of France are evening sojurns across Parisian boulevards, the romantic Seine, quaint restaurants in Normandy, the beautiful Mont St Michel, the lavender fields to the Cote d' Azur or the magnificant palaces of the Loire Valley this CD will bring smiles. A magical transport away from the relentless crudity and vulgarity of modern American music."
2,Made for TV?,"I caught this on TV one day, don't remember when or on what channel, but I remember it still. The bleeding bag bit was the only reason I remember it. Seriously, how could you not notice?I remember how mediocre the acting was, and how rediculous the plot was. The characters were all self-centered, whiny brats. I would rather have watched ""Session 9"" than this.Bottom line: not worth the money"
4,Dawn Explosion Rocks,"I could never thank my friend enough for turning me onto Captain Beyond and 'Dawn Explosion' back in 1977. While 'Explosion' was brand new, so was the band to me - I had never heard of them. Having worn through a couple vinyl albums, it's good to have this gem on CD. ""Do Or Die"" still sounds refreshing today and ""Fantasy"" is a hard rocking romp thru 'moon speed of light'. Both sound great on CD. Overall, it's a bit Pop in places, and while the band was less experimental, the songs are strong and I think this LP was overlooked. A true gem worth picking up."
2,Houston Chronicle on Kindle,Was very dissappointed that the comics and horiscope for the day were not in the kindle paper. I will not purchase this again.
1,Disappointed,I am a new Kindle owner and so far love it. i am very disappointed in the Chron. it is missing a lot of the content I want. where are the columnists? no gardening or religion on Saturday? No Obits? When The Chron ups the content I will subscribe until then I will continue to read it conventially on paper or on line. very disappointing.
4,A classic,"Love this product, Its been around so long for good reason, great scent, and great on the skin - a classic!"
5,Vintage Soderbergh,"It's very hard to overstate just how good this movie actually is. Clooney is great, Lopez is gorgeous, Zahn is funny, Cheadle is evil... everyone is in top form here, but it takes Soderbergh's little touches to make the movie something really special. It's worth watching over and over again, just to see the brief cuts and hear the bass guitar. The script is so smooth that you just sort of coast along on a tide of beautifully delivered one-liners (""The sign says 'shut the ... up,' or can't you fellas read?"") and perfectly played-out dilemmas. Everything here fits together so well that the film is a treat to watch, and is far better than either Traffic or Erin Brockovich. The DVD edition is excellent as well; the deleted scenes reel is priceless. Check it out; you won't be disappointed."
2,You know what they say....first impressions last!,"This is not to say that I liked this movie. If your friends recommend you to see this movie, it's probably because of the fact that Jennifer Lopez is a total HOTTIE! It's best if it's OUT OF SIGHT."
2,what a disappointment for me!,"If you had liked 'Unforgiven', you will probably like 'Out of Sight'.Personally, I found the movie very boring and it is one of those movies produced intentionally to be liked only by movie-commentators."
5,When is this a movie for you?,"If you-like an original movie (taken from an Elmore Leonard novel),-aren't bothered to follow a storyline slightly more complicated than a roadrunner chase,-enjoyed Ocean's Eleven, its story and cool music,-aren't paralyzed by ridiculous stereotypes (like ""tv actors are bad"" or ""latin singers can't act""),-like a romantic comedy that isn't sappy, but intriguing, funny, and has an unusual ending,this might be the movie for you."
2,"way too predictable, no tension",Where was clooney's super hero cape. He was the man with all the right moves every single time. Did he get scratched ?Obviously he was going to hook up with Lopez.No tension or suspense.
3,"Decent movie, great disc","Out of sight is a pretty lackluster performance by both Clooney and Lopez. The movie is almost rescued by Don Cheadle's ruthless ex-con character and Steve Zahn's inept small-time crook. The good news is that the disc does not add any imperfections to the mix. Sound is excellent, including lots of bass-laden music which sounded great on my surround system. The video is also top-notch. Not a bad package, but if you're a Clooney fan I'd check out Peacemaker first."
5,EXCELLENT!!,GREAT MOVIE!!!The chemistry between Clooney & Lopez is the best I have ever witnessed on screen!!! This is J.Lo's best film too date!!! She needs more strong sassy roles lk this!!!!!I love this movie!!!One of the best movies ever made!!!
4,Well Made Caper Flick,"One of the better crime films of the last ten years. Out of Sight features George Clooney as theif and Jennifer Lopez as a U.S. Marshal out to get him. The movie revolves the relationship between the two.Steven Soderbergh adds his touch and makes it an above average crime film. The supporting cast is also excellent, with good performances from Don Cheadle, Ving Rhames, ALbert Brooks, and Steve Zahn.The DVD includes a Sodeebergh commentary, deleted scenes, and trailers.Highly recommended."
4,Great overview,"the graphic bible provides a great easy to read overview of the biblical geography and story line intermixed. it helps provide a frame work for which to place further biblical reading. even though the text is old and current scholarship my question some of its details, i still rely on this text as a great book for new bible readers from children to adults. the maps really help you understand the story."
1,A waste of time,"This book is filled with meaningless information. In fact, information is duplicated throughout the book as if to fill empty space. It seems at times the content serves as a commercial for the timeshare industry, and the ARDA association. This book lacks structure, is devoid of substance, and is an example of a simplistic lazy attempt at writing. Not worth my reading time."
3,"nice product, but.........","I purchased this product as a gift for a coach and it has never been used. Not the company's fault, it's a good quality, just not for everyone...."
4,Rock Nostalgia,"Listening to ""Do You Know What I Mean?"" and ""Rock Me Baby"" brought back memories of having out of body experiences on the shag carpet, playing 5th at ""11"". I remember [sort of] seeing Lee Michaels playing solo in Hampton Roads stadium in 1972 - following Black Sabbath and Savoy Brown. After those two bands the crowd was spent, but Lee was superb - and those Leslie speakers were soulful...If you're in to L.M., or rock classics, this MUST be in your CD collection."
2,"HP 50"" HDTV failed after 15 months","I purchased this TV in November 2007, and it failed in February 2009. I took it to a local TV repair place and they orderd a defective circuit board, only to have the TV blow out that new circuit board too. They indicated that it was a domino effect, and they recommended replacing 4 circuit boards including the control board, Y-sustain board, upper driver, and lower driver board. Parts alone would cost more than $700, and even then they would not guarantee that it would be fixed. I am very disappointed in the reliability of this product. My warranty was 12 months and it failed not too long after that."
3,"Not bad for halogen, but LED is better","This is a great flashlight design. Durable, comfortable, waterproof, and effective.... But... The halogen beam has many artifacts. The beam is not very clean. The spot is decent, but the flood is not so great. I would recommend the Lux LED version for a little more money. It has a much cleaner, more uniform beam."
3,CHOICE FOR THE LEAD COULD BE BETTER,the choice of Lon Cheney Jr for the lead was a mistake. Maria Ospenskaya as the gypsy woman could'nt have been better. Bela lugosi ditto. Cheney was too tall and gauky to make the role believeable. Perhaps his 'Lenny' clouded this performance. All in all an enjoyable picture that could have been better.
5,socks,They were the color I wanted they were a gift for a viking fan she just loved them she wear one color of esch
3,Jamie Lee Mother's Boys,"This is a good Jamie Lee supense film, not one of here besf, but is is vintage Lee if you appreciate her skills."
3,OK if you have 90 days off,"I found the ""formula"" for a healthy protate to be labor intensive, time consuming and nearly impossible if you are a busy person. Also this book gets into some weird stuff that is even beyond ""non traditional"" medicine. This is not just for the person with BPH but for someone who is diagnosed with cancer and can spend the rest of their modified life trying to stay healthy."
4,Very cute!,"Very, very cute item! My twin 3-year-olds loved identifying the animals in the comforter and curling up with them! Not very thick and the fabric is a bit stiff, but still a good value for the price.I ordered two and only one was shipped, though, the other was backordered. Strange!"
2,"Should be titled ""How to Succeed in Commercial Real Estate BROKERAGE""","I was disappointed with the book. I expected a book that would describe how to succeed in commercial real estate for someone wanting to buy and lease out commerical properties. This book hardly touched on the topics I wanted to learn about, such as what makes a property a good investment, how to do due diligence on a property when considering it for purchase, tips on finding a good investment and why it's so hard, pros and cons of development vs buying an existing building, etc. I would have appreciated if the front cover would have made the target audience clearer. Read the table of contents carefully before making the assumption I did!"
1,damaged goods,"The DVD stopped playing before the end of the first act. The subtitles stopped showing on the TV screen before the DVD stopped. This is probably a problem with the original recording because I had previously checked the same performance from the local Tucson public library and that DVD has the same problems.I tried to make a complaint to Amason on a different review request that Amason had sent me, but the return would not function."
2,Rossini- Barber of Seville,It is a fairly old recording and aside from Bartoli the rest is not worth much.
5,Absolutely Beautiful Music,This is an excellent CD of music by some of the greatest composers of all time. It shows just how beautiful the flute is. The only criticism I have is that I thought the three parts of Bach's Orchestral Suite should have been grouped together on the CD. But this is only personal opinion and by no means takes away from the gorgeous flute music.
2,Lee's Worst Album of All!,"I bought this as a record years ago. I was sadly disappointed. It just didn't have Lee's Classic Sound I had grown to love.The whole thing just dragged on like he was sedated. The fact that there were only four songs didn't help. It lacks imagination. I traded my copy to a second-hand record store. Sorry Lee, nothing personel! I give it a D+."
5,WOW! DON'T MISS THIS ONE!,"Shelley Thacker is one of my favorite writers, and TIMELESS spotlights her wonderful talent. If you're looking for adventure, romance, and a fast-paced read, this is the book for you!"
4,punk done right,While certainly not mxpx's best effort it is a great debut on A&M. with the consistant great musicianship and tightness MxPx always didplays they invoke pure punk joy for any true punk fan. Plus theres the cover of the Cootees great i'm ok you're ok. take the mainstream boys full steam ahead!
2,life in general was better,"This one was not nearly as good as the other ones. It just didn't have the mxpx magic. There were a couple songs that were good. most of it was just stupid. If you are really into the band, buy it. If not I would suggest Life in general for a first time listener.Don't get me wrong these guys are good.just not this CD maybe they are to old now???"
5,The Best MxPx Review... Ever.,"O, My People- I cannot even express how much I dig this CD. I am, like, oh my god, one of, like, MxPx's (oh my god), biggest, like, fans. I own all of their CD's 'cuz they friggin rawk!! but this one is definitely my favorite. ""Party, My House, Be There"", is the greatest song of all time-- I will never get sick of it. 'cuz everytime i hear it, its like a PaRtY. At My House. When Everyone Is Going to Be There. every other song on here also kicks. I Like MxPx!! You should, too. Buy this CD."
5,I LOVE THIS Cd,"I love this CD and MxPx is an awesome punk band. Their other albums are also great too, and I would highly reccomend this album. I saw them in concert with blink 182, homegrown and river fenix wich I would also reccomend doing."
3,neutral is the only word to describe this cd,"This CD is not really awesome, but it doesn't suck too bad either. It's really nothing special. I got this CD because I heard everyone saying it was wonderful, the best CD ever, etc., but that's just not what it was. I found myself able to listen to this CD, it's not like one of those CDs where you're thinking ""Oh my gosh, this is awful, I can't listen to it!"" I didn't turn this CD off, but the thing is that I just can't get into the songs. They all sound the same and MxPx sounds a lot like many other bands. I like the kind of CD that jumps out at you, that leaves you no choice but to listen to it again, and again, and again, and to just leave it in your CD player. This CD wasn't like that. I heard this was a good Christian band, but it doesn't even sound that way. If you're looking for a GREAT christian CD that is actually different and sounds really awesome, I'd recommend Dogwood's ""Building a Better Me"" or Relient K ""Anatomy of the Tongue in Cheek."""
5,"Im ok your ok is an awsome song,so is mxpx, mike is great","I am from phoenix arizona and i was just recently introduced to mxpx. I went to the warp tour and got to see an outstanding preformance by them. I think they are all really great. Mike is a really nice guy, he took the time after the show to say hello and I thought that was cool."
1,MxPx deserves praise for not making this album any longer!,"MxPx tries to follow in the path of other great hardcore/punk bands from the West Coast like Pennywise, AFI, Jughead's Revenge, etc. but fail dismally. Hasn't this uninspired hardcore and noise faded away to times remembered? Why would we want to relive this? I know I won't!!!"
3,"So, So",I've always been a fan of Gerald McRaney (since his days as Rick Simon) but this movie seemed a little strained. His sidekick didn't seem to fit very well into the story.
1,Not a Jim Benton product,"This is NOT a Jim Benton product. Jim Benton does It's Happy Bunny, Dear Dumb Diary. Meanydoodles, Franny K Stein, jOkObO and lots of other stuff available on Amazon.com. But not this. How do I know? I'm Jim Benton."
2,Red Shoe Diaries DVD,"Red Shoe Diaries DVD was in poor quality, could not even hear or see the actors the majority of the time. Had scratches, poor packaging with broken DVD case and covering. I will not buy from this seller again!"
4,The Way to Rainy Mountain,Good book and in good condition. Shipping didn't take long at all got it about 3 of 4 days after i ordered it.
3,Mary Colter facinating but often overlooked architect.,"""Builder upon the Red Earth"" is not the slick tome of expensive color photographs and analytical drawings that Mary Colter's unique contribution to Twentieth Century American Architecture deserves. However, this essentially biographical book is the only one in print showing pictures and telling the history of Mary Colters extrodinary talent.It is not clear if Mary Colter's obscurity is due to the fact that she was a woman practicing architecture in a time when the field was dominated by men or if the remote Southwestern locations of her most interesting works kept them hidden form view, but it is high time more people took a serious look at her work. Colter's projects, which are ""built ruins"" foreshadow the work of Western deconstructionist architects like Antoine Predoc or Tom Maine. Showing the work of Colter which is almost 80 years ahead of its time ""Builder upon the Red Earth"" should be in every young architects library."
5,Brilliant!,"The opening scene at the café will go into history for one of the most romantic scenes ever recorded. The actor (B.Pitt) and actress are wonderful, the scene has quite a schockgul outcome. The movie itself is superb, 3 hours goes by quicklier than imagined, and you sit back thinking of meaning with life and death. GREAT!!!!"
5,"I was pleasantly surprised, it was a very good movie","I've never seen the original, so I don't have a basis with which to judge this as a remake, which, in hindsight, is probably better, since I didn't give a second thought to ""comparing"". Having seen it for the movie it is though, I've got to say I enjoyed it, and had no problem staying captivated throughout the 3 hours. And, if I may be honest, there were several moments that brought upon me that old lump-in-the-throat feeling, accompanied by watery eyes, (which can be difficult to induce in your standard 20 year old male, being the sometimes seemingly de-sensitized group that we are). Anyways, rent or buy the movie, sit down with any significant others, and enjoy a good story."
2,Acting technique battles spoil movie,"Too long gazing into space.- For them and me.- Emotion in this movie is displayed by the two so called lovers looking left then right then briefly at each other's face to portray anything from constipation to puzzelment. Where was the chemistry? If death is all knowing why does he act like a teenage kid on his second date. Credibility was indeed missing. Brad Pitt was very inconsistent with his character analysis. I was not confident with his performace at all.Each one of his scenes he appeared not sure of what he was suposed to do - so looked left and right before proceeding, a bit like a school kid before crossing the road! I could not come to terms with his kiss of death! Should not the victim have died ! Two plastic people in a very plastic movie."
5,You must watch this one...,"..alone, in the dark, after 9pm at nite for the best possible viewing experience. I have cried at 3 movies in my life, and this is one of them. You will be surprised that you have found such a jewel when you watch this classic. GET IT! and SHARE IT! :)"
4,Something special,"There is something about this movie that is difficult to put your finger on. It gets under your skin. It's easy to note the beautiful acting of of Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani, and the absolutely phenomenal cinematography and the sublime soundtrack. But it is more than all of that. The film says something about life and the value of ""sucking the marrow"" out of it that makes it irresistible to me. And the scene where Pitt and Forlani meet for the first time is one of the sweetest caught on film that I've ever seen."
2,Final cut is not a toy,"This risible movie falls just short of being a legendary disaster. Barring it from greatness are its ultra-glossy production values, the always wonderful Anthony Hopkins, and the undeniable charisma of Brad Pitt who (though it kills me to say it) survives even such dignity-threatening scenes as the hospital visit to the Jamaican woman in respectable shape.That said, this is still the most excruciatingly protracted screen death since ""Cries and Whispers"". I trust that the enormous financial failure of this movie will guarantee that Martin Brest is never allowed final cut again."
4,High Praise for March - not Pitt,"The primary reason to buy this DVD set is NOT for ""Meet Joe Black"" (a forgetable, dry movie), but for the amazing ""Death Takes a Holiday"" from 1934. For some idiotic reason this is the only way you can buy it - pinned to Brad Pitt's coattail. Frederic March was one of the greatest actors in the history of film, and his performance here is moving and fascinating. Anderson's screenplay gives him a lot of difficult material to interpret. Overall, a brilliant, thought-provoking film. It should stand alone and not have to share space with ""Joe Black."""
5,A masterpiece,"I really loved this movie. I watched it when it first came out and I watched it again yesterday with my brother and sister (it was their first time). My brother asked a question that I had always wondered: why didn't this movie receive the acclamation it deserved? Yes, it's pretty hard to convince people that death has feelings and falls in love, but it was presented to us in the best way possible. Brad Pitt's performance was great, Hopkins' was phenominal. The emotional story about love and life was strong enough to move. It should of won an award. In my eyes it was a masterpiece."
5,Can I give it 6 stars?,"I have seen this movie about 10 times now. I hope this DVD never wears out. It is surely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Anthony Hopkins, Brad Pitt and Claire Forlani are all excellent. I found it exciting, romantic and emotive. It is 3 hours long but that time seems to pass in the blink of an eye. If you haven't seen this film, you are missing out."
3,Not as funny as I thought it would be.,It was okay I just though it would be funnier than it was. More serious than funny. If you want comedy find another movie.
4,A great movie,"Yes for adults. give me a break,give me a break,give me a break,give me a break,give me a break, give me a break"
3,enjoyed the sentiment of the film,"I feel the film dragged on a bit in spots,but the General Sentiment of the film truyl hit home. you have to forgive&don't wish no ill will on anybody. even when folks are straight up hatin on you,you still have to forgive them&always wish them the best.Tyler Perry is a Very Creative Cat.not quite what I expected at all.I thought this might be on some Waiting to Exhale hate-athon but it wasn't that kind of Party. it was cool."
3,Question for fans of Tyler Perry,"Let's say that instead of Tyler Perry, the character of Madea was played by RuPaul. Would this transvestite performance be as funny or as accepted as to be praised by such words: ""He has a true blessing from God"" or ""It is a drama/comedy, a damned funny comedy, that actually supports and puts forth Christian values!""? I cannot find Scripture that supports cross-dressing nor any such intepretation by any mainstream Christian churches. Are believers blind to the useage of deviant behavior in their FAMILY ENTERTAINMENT or is this performance somehow transformed because it supports our view of family and godliness?"
4,Funny and Heartfelt!!!,"Well I got this movie at Blockbuster as a used movie. That'll teach me as it is the same price here at Amazon.com for a new one. Anyways, I really en joyed this movie. Unlike Big Momma's House, this movie is funny and does not exaggerate with the Madea character. I truly enjoyed that this movie was not just funny but truly had a heartfelt effort that you felt the pain and anguish that the characters went through. AFter watching the movie, I ventured to the DVD extras and found that Tyler Perry played Brian, Madea, and Joe. I had no idea who he was and had not seen anything from Tyler before, SO I was happily surprised in learning he does the Madea character. I am now looking forward to more of his work. This movie should definitely be on your collection."
2,Not a Comedy,"This movie is being described and sold as a comedy. It is not one. It has several funny lines, but the movie is more of a romantic drama. If you are looking for a comedy I do not recommend this at all."
4,Awsome movie!!!,"This is Perry's best movie to this date . The movie is about touching rock bottom and making it back.It is funny, you will laugh, and maybe cry. I also love the gospel songs"
1,AWFUL!,"This movie had the most pointless plot and sappy dialouge i have ever seen. The romance in the movie was completely ruined by the cheap, unbelieveable, LENGTHY dialouge. Pointless characters, and uninteresting plot. Overall, this film was 1 hour 56 minutes too long. TOTAL MOVIE CRUD!"
1,Pass The Plate,"Usually when I see something this preachy someone passes me a plate for a donation. What a shame this excellent cast was wasted on such a rediculous movie. Not only was the story in your face with an I'm-better-than-you-because-I'm-a-Christian attitude, but it was also predictable. Jez Louise! I can't believe this script attracted the tallent it did."
5,Tyler Perry's Diary of a Mad Black Woman,"Awesome movie, I watched it over and over. If you need a good belly laugh then you will have to watch this movie."
5,Excited,"I bought this movie for my 11 yr old for christmas, she had always talked about how funny it was, but didnt own it. She had a big smile on her face when she opened it."
2,Diary of a stupid movie!,"The story to this movie is totally unbelievable, stupid and ridiculous! First of all why was Grandma a transvestite? Why would Orlando keep going after Helen, when she kept treating him like crap! I guess he likes women that look like gorillas. This movie ended up being more of a drama than a comedy. Also why would Orlando take Helen back after she ran out on him? He just proposed to her, she sees on TV that her husband got shot, and she runs to the hospital to him. Doesn't see Orlando for three weeks, all of a sudden decides she wants to be back with him, and he takes her back. This whole movie is so damn stupid, I can't believe how many people gave it a good review!"
3,DVD was very Dirty!,This movie is my all time fav! I am a big fan of tyler perry.When i got this dvd i was happy 2 get it bc my other one gotbroke! when i got this (used) dvd it was very dirty i had to clean itbefore i even watched it. the seller should of made sure it wasclean before sending out!
4,Another great Fluke single,"This is the Squirt single from Fluke. Squirt appears on their albums Oto and Risotto. The Oto version is not, unfortunately, on either single. There are three mixes of Squirt, and one of Slid (PDFMONE) on this CD, though it is mislabeled to say all four are mixes of Squirt. Of the Squirt mixes the instrumental is the best, and is, per its title, just the musical background to the song. The CD as a whole is one of Fluke's more calm singles, with slightly slower music than much of their other work. For any Fluke fan, or fan of techno music in general, especially Juno Reactor or Leftfield, this CD is a pretty good purchase as you won't be let down by it."
4,Spetsnaz vs. Orange Sector,"I was talking with Pontus Stalberg of Spetsnaz before a show not to long ago. We were talking about music and bands. He asked if i had ever heard of Proceed and to check them out cause he produced two of they're albums. I took his advice and was glad I did. Proceed is exactly the type of Music/Band that I love. Very minimal EBM with the hard edge synths. Pounding bass lines & rhythmic drums. The vocals are hard and low with English & German lyrics. This is their second CD. They sound very similar to Orange Sector meets Spetsnaz. Pontus shares co-lead vocals on a track & has a hidden track of just him and it sounds like Spetsnaz of course. If you like great minimal EBM & bands like Nitzer ebb, Ionic Vision, Fixmer/McCarthy, Militant Cheerleaders, & especially Spetsnaz and Orange Sector, you'll Love This Disc!!"
4,The world of professional swimming,Gave a glimpse of the professional swimming world. Starting with kids beginning swimming to Olympians from the perspective of professional coach. Entertaining and more appreciative to the sport. But too late for me to join.
5,The Essence of Swimming,"If you are not a swimmer already, you will want to be after completing this book. If you are a swimmer, then you will be thankful that someone has captured the essence of what those elite athletes at the other end of the pool do while you slog it out at 5 AM in the morning.Mullen does an unbelievable job capturing the unrelenting workouts, the devastating highs, the excruciating lows, and reality of what happens when you stick your neck out there to pursue a dream.Finally, as a competitive swimmer, Mullen is able to capture the awesomeness of these Olympians and at the same time showing that these people are indeed mere mortals. Most of the Olympians that I have seen train and have had the opportunity are much like Tom Wilkens: hard working, determined people who love their sport and are very approachable."
3,Gold in the water.,"This book was so inspiring to me.I have been a swimmer my whole life, and this book truely show the challenges and the hurttles that swimmer have to face. I think that they are true rolemodels, they had a dream of going to the Olympics and they chased that dream never giving up. They acheived the dream of olympic glory.This book beautifully showed the relasionship between the swimmers and there coach, and how together they achevied there dream."
5,Read this book!,This book was an excellent example of human will and the sacrifices an athlete makes to achieve a dream. It was an engrossing page turner and I highly recommend it.
2,house of fury,"excellent movie; however the movie did not come in its original package, but a clear plastic holder. I do recommend buying from this vendor."
2,basic and plain,"somehow, this movie manages to have certain mainstream elements and also shows signs of a B-movie. some of the fighting scenes are worthy and the plot is semi ok. this movie was pretty hype when it first came out here in the USA, but after buying the dvd, i was not impressed. the ending, the last scene after the finale fight, how bad guy gets caugh. the bad guy does something that i laughed my rear end off. (think wheelchair and wall)..im not gonna say much more here and give it all away, but each time i rewound that part, i simply could not stop laughing, because it was so stupid and yet kinda/can/could be real or happen. hehehehehe, geez, im laughing already now just telling you guys about it.but yes, watch it, dont expect to see a masterpiece."
5,so cute,"I love this board! It is of such a great quality that after my kids are grown, I'm sure I""ll be able to save it for my grandkids. Such a good idea making different latches for kids to open. It is entertaining and challenges those little brains and hand muscles."
5,What a fun puzzle!,We bought this for our son who will be 3 in August. He has been doing puzzles ever since he was 1 and wanted to get him something different. He loves this puzzle. He had some trouble with #2 the window latch. It is a little hard to turn and even I had trouble turning it. He loves to open all the doors and windows and find the pictures behind them.
3,"good puzzle, but did not receive the same puzzle as the picture","We did receive a latches board, just not the one picutred above. My 2 year old daughter loves puzzles and really enjoys playing with this one. It is a bit more advanced than she can handle right now, but she really enjoys the challenge."
5,Nifty toy,"My son, who is always trying to figure out how things work, loves this toy. He is 12 mos but he is a regular Houdini. While this may not have helped my cause, he likes to latch and unlatch each set of barn doors and find who's inside. Much more interesting than a lift-the-flap book and sturdier if your kid is hard on toys. Nice wood construction with very sturdy latches (I worried they would be flimsy metal snap apart). No sharp points and very well secured. It is a little heavy."
4,Excellent,"This product arrived in perfect condition but being that it is a gift for my grandson, I cannot attest to anything else until he actually begins playing with it."
4,Awesome toy...but watch those fingers!,"This is a great board. Develops fine motor skills and provides long periods of concentration. The only negative thing I would have to say about it is that one of the latches (top middle) is very tight and sharp and if little fingers aren't paying attention, they could be caught. Would still repurchase!"
5,Busy for a whole 1/2 hour,"Ok - the title is anticlimactic, but this is a really big deal for a 16 month old busy boy. He likes figuring out how to open it up and of course expects a victory ""Yay"" once he's conquered a door. I think this toy will last for a few more years to come and continue to be entertaining!!"
4,"Very nice toy, my nephew enjoys playing with it.",This board is well made. It was a very creative idea to engage children in what they are naturally inquisitive about. Excellent for strengthening fine motor skills. I wish that I would have thought of it.
2,My cat will eat any treat I give her...,"but not this one. My 17+ year old cat is not finicky when it comes to treats. She never met one she didn't like till I tried to pawn these off on her. She actually ate the first one I gave her and has repeatedly refused any others. (Perhaps she knows this treat is good for her?) However, I left one for her just in case she changed her mind. It got very hard in a very short period of time. I could not even break it apart. Even straight out of the bag these are very difficult to break apart and I am assuming it would be difficult to chew. I have tried these off and on for several weeks and she refuses to even taste another one. In the trash they go."
3,"okay cd with some jams, but nothing in comparisson to coop's other cd's.","Mr. Coop is a lyricist, and his music jam's. but i was dissapointed by this cd. poisonous game and game still deadly are much better cd's. this cd has at beast 5 jams on it, the rest are album fillers. Overall coop is still a hell of a rapper and still holdin it down."
5,Touching and universal in appeal,"Beautifully written, a memoir for all ages. You will carry this young man's authentic experiences in your heart, and be charmed by his tales."
3,Needs a different knob,We really like the retractable closths dryer with the exception of the knob on the left end that locks the line in place. The knob broke shortly after we installed it and in order to use it we have to pull it out with vice grips and leave them hanging on it until we're ready to retract it. Other than this inconvenience we really like it.
4,Mostly happy,"This is my second clothesline of this make and model and really appreciate that it is identical to the first (lasted about 20 years!), which made the installation a snap. However, the individual lines were so uneven that I had to redo all the lines so they were the same tautness before I could use it. Think it should have come from the factory with the lines all even and ready to use!"
1,Quality is lousy - and seller has disappeared,Only had this a few weeks and the knob to tighten the line already broke. I do NOT recommend buying this product as you will be wasting your money! I can't track down the seller and I am NOT going to get just a partial refund from Amazon (plus pay shipping) for a defective item that has already broken. Next time I will shop locally so I can return a bad product.
1,DO NOT BUY,"We have utilized 2 of these units in the last 3 years... why? They both were susceptible to plastic failure. The maker should use metal at the stress point, that being the line tension adjustment screw on the left side. Worked well for a couple of weeks then when the lines started to sag, the tension was adjusted and the plastic broke rendering the unit useless. *** PLEASE DO NOT BUY *** A waste of your money!"
1,Plastic Failure,"The Cloths line worked reasonably well for the first few months, but then the plastic knob on the left side broke and, apparently, cannot be replaced. The piece is actually a ratcheting lock that keeps the line tensioned. Without it the line will just sag and is useless. As stated above, this part should not be plastic.I went to the company website ""Whitney Design"" and there isn't even a link for support or parts; check it out. That's a question I should have asked before paying $55 for this; ""Does the company support what they sell?""I would not buy this product again."
1,Clothes dryer,"Not a very good idea unless you are six feet tall. You have to tighten the lines with each use and I have to carry a stool outside to do this. Also, even after tightening the lines, they still droop. If you want a clothesline, get two sturdy posts and stretch a wire!"
3,5 Line Retractable Clothes Line,Overall this is not a bad product. The company was very prompt in sending out the order. It was very easy to install. The problem was that when the lines were pulled out they were very uneven. Each line had to be restrung to ensure the correct amount of tension on all 5 lines. That took a little work to accomplish. Once that was corrected it worked fine.
2,Did not meet the burden of proof,"I thoroughly enjoyed the read and will probably read some more of Scott Turow's books in the future. But basically I was disappointed in this one. The plot was quite convoluted, but in the end, not credible. The characters seemed to be thoroughly developed, but many behaved completely inconsistently making the story seem totally contrived at the conclusion. Who would have guessed that an unrepentant, reprehensible cad would suddenly suffer the pangs of conscience? Besides I was rooting for Sonny and Sandy!"
5,"Refreshing, down to earth and realistic.",The plot of Burden of Proof twists in a way that keeps you reading on. The story about a lawyer and the death of his wife is down to earth and the main character is refreshingly straightfoward about life in general. There doesn't seem anything fictional about it. A must read.
2,picture does not match actual item,"I expected what was pictured but should have read the description better - it's actually quite small - a 2 inch oval that is about 1/4 inch thick - really small. ok, but not as expected."
1,Terrible!,I hated this film! It was so corny and weird. I have never seen a video like it! The music was awful and it gave you a bad feeling to watch it! Babe's voice is terrible. I hate the scene where the dog is drowning and my whole family hates this video. Don't ever buy it! You are wasting good money! I wish I could give it no stars to!
2,"Babe, ""double feature""","This is not what I consider a ""double feature"". there is 1 and only 1movie. What follows is a juvenile component of identifying barnyard noises with the respective animals. Very misleading to call it a ""double feature"". Should state that it has an interactive component for juveniles."
1,Worst Children's Movie EVER!,What a horrific movie to gear towards children. It is extremely violent and just plain creepy! The scene where the dog is hanging from a chain and drowning in water was so WRONG. I wish I could put 0 stars for this one. Do not waste your money on this one.
2,They didn't know what to do with this one,"Babe: Pig in the City is one of the weirdest movies I've ever seen. It was strange, and creepy, and not like the first Babe at all. Being a fan of its predecessor, I thought I would like this one, but it was very disappointing. A couple gross parts with Mrs. Hoggett, some with the animals and neighbors. Yuck. I give it 2 stars because there were a couple (and ONLY a couple) funny parts. But don't watch this movie unless you want a letdown!"
1,Did I miss something?,"Film of the year, is this ""Babe pig in the city"" we are talking about?The first film was magical, endearing and quite clearly aimed at children.The sequel, should surely aim for similar goals?After 40 minutes of unrelenting bleakness and darkness enough was enough, it had to be turned off. (I know it was probably about to get lighter and be brilliant, but I think not)Where was the slightly other worldly feel of the first film?It had been stamped on by the nightmarish vision of some studio exec on his/her way back on the ""red eye"" from LA.I know some people have said it is not a childrens film, who was it designed for??Two 15 year boys at the pictures, ""two for Babe pig in the city please, to enable us to appreciate it's subtle nuances and metaphors of real life"".I don't think so.Avoid this film and for goodness sake don't let your young kids watch it, unless you want to spend all night comforting them."
4,Okay but not as good as the first one.,This movie was mix because i thought the beginning was bad. The end was fine though overall i think this is a okay movie.
2,Not worth the cost of admmission,"""Babe:Pig In The City was not very good because it was very dark and not sweet and cute like the first one and definetlly not for kids younger then seven."
1,Holy Crap!,"I can't believe how bad this movie was. I was gald when it was over when I saw it in the theater for the first time. Worst sequel ever made. Creepy, boring, and just plain sad. Take my advice, don't ever see this freakin' movie!"
5,Always a favorite,"This double feature was a bargain. I love the Babe stories, and will watch them both many times, I am sure."
1,Babe in the Trash - do not waste your money!,"I was so disappointed with BABE: Pig in the City! The 1st was fun and the kids loved it.The 2nd version is ""too scary"" for children. It is mean, dark and not kid safe. My 2.5 and 4.5 year olds freaked when they saw it.Do not waste you time and money. Far better films are available."
3,Nice Coffee Table Book,"Breezy but informative text, but the reason for buying this is obviously the photos, which make this worthwhile for those with an interest in Mayan culture, particularly ritual."
5,the future of hip hop,i got this cd last week and i love it i have his hungry broke and determine cd and this one is much better then hungry but hungry was a good cd too. i think each time he releases a new cd it will get better and better!
4,"Fresh, feminine perspectives on an ancient culture","The selection of women writers was varied enough to get glimpses of both urban and village life, and in both the East and West of Turkey, which I learned from this book are very different areas. I didn't care for all of the stories - which is fine with me; I don't expect to identify with every female on the planet. The writing quality varies. While I presume the editor(s) did a bunch of cleaning up, they did not take away the different voices, which is a good thing. If you are curious about what a modern, Muslim-dominated society looks like, especially from a female (and usually feminist), non-Turkish point of view , this is a great place to start. I suspect readers will be pleasantly surprised. I certainly was."
5,Wonderful stories of Turkey,"Having just been to Turkey for a couple of weeks, this explained a lot of what we experienced. Would not have had the some impact if I had read it before going there. Mixed marriages always have some difficulties but how I admired these women, many of whom were taken into a culture so different from anything they had ever even dreamt about. A great book."
5,VERY GOOD,5 stars because once again another bargain.To me this is like music samples on a CD rather than the best of or greatest hits.This CD is clear sounding.this is worth buying.This is perfect for those who wants to sample music.
1,[junky] spawn,"My God, what a [junky] movie! I'm a lover of ""B"" rated horror movies and usually the campier the better, but if there's such a thing as a ""E"" of ""F"" rated movie this is it. The plot is obviously a ripoff of ""The Wasp Woman"", the special effects are practically non-exsistant, the monster is stupid looking, (I did like the teeth) and I've see better acting in porno movies. The only redeeming feature of this turkey is the physical appearance of the woman actors, the're for the most part pretty darn good looking. I could keep going, tearing this thing to shreds, but let me suffice to say I haven't seen a movie this bad since ""Attack of the Mushroom People"""
5,Warm Memories of My Childhood,"I bought this mainly for ""Blue Tango,"" which I heard played in my home in the late 50's, early 60's, as a very small child. It was a beautiful song then, its a beautiful song now. That is music! The whole CD is very good. So far other big favorites are ""Bell of the Ball,"" ""Forgotten Dreams,"" ""Serenata,"" ""The Golden Year,"" and ""The Girl in Satin."" There are songs I've heard all my life like ""Sleigh Ride,"" and ""Fiddle Faddle,"" but never associated with anyone until now. This CD would have been worth the price for ""Blue Tango,"" alone, but I got more. Come on fellow rock n roll lovers, expand your horizons."
2,Original and no more.,It's a very unlikely and non-sense movie.The script was mediocre as the awful directing.But the special effects are awesome and William's performance was great.
5,Awesome Movie,"This movie was recommended by a christian friend. This is a very good movie. This movie is more than what meets the eye. If you are into the spiritual, afterlife experiences with a somewhat answer to it all, this movie can help with developing ideas that can be confirmed by biblical sound scripture."
5,"A handsomely-crafted, wonderful depiction of the afterlife!","This is a powerful movie that really packs a wollup! The emotional performances receive 4 out of 5 stars, while the effects are truly stupendous. The visions of the different levels of hell give the viewer a sense that hell is not only fire and burning. Hell is your life gone wrong. The DVD version of this film is terrific, full of special features. The Dolby Surround track is greatly mastered, with sound shooting out from every speaker. If you love Robin Williams, this is for you!"
1,mala calidad,No se vio la película en dvd tuve que verla desde una laptop;( mala compra no recomiendo k la compren
1,Schmaltz-a-thon,"Confused, schmaltzy, ersatz tearjerker. Manages to make heaven look a lot like a bad acid trip. Even my wife didn't like it."
1,"Miserable, depressing, and confused","This film attempts in every frame to be ""important,"" and fails on so many levels it's almost funny. From the get go, its somber approach of a dead mans search for his dead family through an imagination of classic painters falls flat. The effects are nice, but after 2 minutes of them, you expect the story to go somewhere--and it doesn't. The acting is one note, and so incredibly somber throughout the film has little emotional texture. Really a miserable, depressing film."
5,Simply a great movie !!!,"Life never ends, we all must believe in it... Life on earth it's just a reencarnation from other lifes. Our journey on planet earth is just for us to grow up spiritually... Some how, ""What Dreams May Come"" advertises us with a wonderfull story that life never ends. When someone dies, that person's soul goes to another life, in another body, to other dimension, to a better or less better place. There is no hell or heaven, it's all in our mind."
1,very misleading!,"I have a friend affected by suicide, and the movie portays suicides as going to hell....OFFENSIVE AND HURTFUL!!"
5,I can't stop thinking about this movie.,"I will remember this movie forever. This movie was so full of touching moments, incredible scenery and sincere acting. It is not a children's fairy tale. This movie is for adults who want to be think, reflect and be moved. Unless you are completely unfeeling, you will cry. The movie moves you through most every emotion. This is a sit down and watch it withough interuptions movie. You will think about this movie for days afterward. This is a must-own movie."
3,I didn't care for Robin Williams' role in this movie.,"Robin Williams is a terrific comedy actor and that is where he should stay. Not only did I not like the movie, I did not understand all the flashbacks. Shame on Robin for hoping the visual effects would carry on the story."
5,A cool movie,An interesting take on life after death. A totally unexpected set of rules to live by. A serious rold for Williams.
3,'Hell IS Other People'! Dante and Sartre together at last!,"The DVD version is definitely the way to watch this film, as there are only a few good scenes, with the rest being pretty formulaic and saccharine, the usual impossibly nice and impossibly rich Hollywood fantasy character as hammed by Robin Williams. Yet for all its nauseating flaws, the movie's got a few killer scenes that are both visually stunning AND thought provoking to boot! This alone is so extremely rare in these last days of the decline of Western civilisation, that it is worth catching. For me, it was a poignant expression of Sartre's immortal insight that 'Hell is other people'. Indeed. And heaven is a garden of eden with perhaps just one or two other people. Yet another symptom of the building population explosion anxiety, where humans increasingly detest each other merely because there are so many of them who are just like us!!!"
5,movie review,"What dreams may come is a beautiful love story. The scenery is beautiful the special effects are out of this world. This is a must see for the romantic at heart. Its sad, funny, and one of my favorite Robin Williams serious roles. The whole cast is amazing."
5,A Great Film! :D,"I had originally bought this for my mother for her birthday, but I ended up watching it more than her! The film is very existential, and it makes one think about life. For more information, I would watch a trailer of the movie on YouTube. I give this film 5 out of 5 stars."
2,It murdered the book on which it was based,"I read the book by the same title for the first time in 1984. I was entranced by it. I have since read this book about once a year because I feel that it is that wonderful and I get something new out of it each time I read it. I had always hoped that they would make it into a movie. Lo and behold, 15 years later they did. I couldn't wait to see. When I did I was extremely disappointed. I hated that the screenwriters felt the need to change the original story line so much, because I did not see the need to change so lovely and magical a story line. For me, that completely ruined the movie. If I had not read the book first I would have probably enjoyed it more. If I were Mr. Matheson, I would have felt violated by all the changes, which in the movie, turned out to be contrived, cheesy and predictable. The only aspect of this movie that I did enjoy was the visuals. If one has not yet read the original book, do so now, it is extraordinary!"
1,Sheer torture,"If I could give 0 star to this film, I would. I absolutely adore Robin Williams, but this film was sheer torture to sit through. The plot is convoluted and the characters unlikeable, or at best, incomprehensible. Annabella Sciorra's character becomes so inexplicably depressed that you're left at a loss as to why Robin Williams' character would even stand by her. The visual effects are stunning, but just can't make up for the miserable plot. The best thing about the film, seriously, is the title, which was what made me want to watch it in the first place and left me wondering halfway, when is this going to end???"
1,Goo-topia,"I recognize that some people prefer mawkish, poorly written tearjerkers that attempt to make up in appearance what they lack in substance. To these I say, ""you will enjoy this movie."""
1,"Congratulations Artisan, You've Ruined Another Great Movie","Gunmen is one of my favorite action movies, it's got great scenery, action galore, a fast pace, and great performances, especially from Denis Leary, who steals the show as villain Armor. However this DVD really hurts the film. It's presented in pan-and-scan with poor quality and so-so sound, and has no extras. Artisan ruined another great movie called Joshua Tree (or Army Of One, as the DVD cover for that movie incorrectly states) with the DVD, which featured a similar DVD transfer (very poor). I'd wait for a re-release with a better transfer and sound and with the film in it's OAR plus with some extras, like a commentary and making-of featurette..."
3,Inoffensively silly action-comedy,"With its mixture of broad humour, violent action and buddy-buddy storyline, ""Gunmen"" appears to be a film nostalgic for the eighties genre which produced the likes of ""Lethal Weapon"" and ""48 Hrs"". It is no match for either, however. The performances are all mostly second-base. The dialogue is strictly B-movie quality. It will afford plenty of entertainment to undemanding audiences. Includes some beutiful vistas of Latin American locations and some genuinely unlikeable villains, as portrayed by Denis Leary and Patrick Stewart."
3,Very sluggish(weak),"This cd does not say anything new. It(he) is like all the previous ones, with the escepcion of the 1 , the best cd of the group with difference. This cd alternates good songs with really sluggish(weak) others. It is the problem of this group. In every album, the half of the songs or mas are not very good. If they do not change, I certainly it is the last cd that I buy of them (and I have all)"
5,en route,Well worth the wait...this is an exploration in great jazz! Can't get it out of the CD player! A must have
3,low key movie with good acting,"I like this movie, it's interesting yet not quite satisfying. Brad Pitt is very understated in this movie, doesn't quite go over the top like in his other films. Katherine Keener is excellent has his insecure, emotionally unstable girlfriend. Interesting film about relationships but I have to admit it doesn't really go anywhere. It can't decided if it wants to be a straight ahead romantic comedy or a surreal Lynchian type trip, and kind of meanders between both, the result is somewhat tepid. Mostly for Pitt or Keener fans.One thing that REALLY annoyed me though, was my DVD had stupid commentary at the beginning and the end which I *swear* is not on the VHS version. Kind of reminded me of Blade Runner, just ruined it. It's not quite as bad as BR, but I was disapointed."
3,Instrumental Only,"This cd wasn't bad, but there were only one or two songs I liked. I hadn't realized before picking it up that it is almost entirely instrumental, which wasn't what I was looking for. I think I'll skip this one and keep looking."
4,Good cd,"I bought this cd to practice for my latin dance class and it does the trick. It is all instrumental, but like I said, it works for what I wanted it for!"
4,The first (3) tracks are pure 100% funky jazz...............,".........but the second side just looses steam into straight up piano lead jazz. A whole album's worth of funky goodness would of been nice, but I am definately happy with what I got. ""Out on the Coast"" would of been worth the price alone- I personally grab anything with a GROOVE MERCHANT stamp of approval. It's the ""RETURN of JAZZ-FUNK"" ya dig?"
4,The Coop's MCA Years,"The time that Alice Cooper spent with record label MCA was once of recovering lost ground and reclaiming his position as King of Shock Rock.He recorded two albums(CONSTRICTOR,RAISE YOUR FIST AND YELL)and staged two killer tours to support them;sounding heavier than any album since WELCOME TO MY NIGHTMARE.PRINCE OF DARKNESS is an excellent summation of this period.Guitarist muscleman Kane Roberts was an excellent foil for Alice during the MCA years;the proof of this can be heard on tracks like FREEDOM, PRINCE OF DARKNESS,and TEENAGE FRANKENSTEIN.I have only two gripes with this album:1)electro-drums on some of the tracks;and 2)the abscence of such tracks as NOT THAT KINDA LOVE,CHOP CHOP CHOP/GAIL,THE GREAT AMERICAN SUCCESS STORY,and GIVE THE RADIO BACK.All in all,a good album if you want to start of with a general overview of the ""comeback"" years."
3,Best of Constrictor/Raise Your Fist Album,If you don't have the Cooper metal albums you may want to check this out. Cooper has had better material than this but it's pretty good. I prefer Fist to Constrictor personally. There is however a fine live version of Billion Dollar Babies. If you already own Constrictor/RYFAY this isn't really necessary but RYFAY is becoming hard to find so you may be interested.
1,"rip-off, both albums fit onto 1 disc, why do it this way?","This album combines the Raise Your Fist and Constrictor albums of the mid to late 80's. I'd recomend you buy those 2 albums on there own rather then this rip-off. I call it a rip off because I know for a fact that all the tracks from both Raise Your Fist and Constrictor fit onto the same 80 minute CD and still have room left for a bonus track or 2!So instead of picking out a random few off each album, they should have combined the two complete albums and put them on this and maybe included ""Hard Rock Summer in the USA"", ""Be Crool To Your Skool"" or ""Under My Wheels (Feat. Guns N Roses), ""I got a line or you"" or even one of the alternate versions of ""He's back"""
4,Harry's Swan Song?,"Harry Bosch is working the murder case of a 12 year old boy whose bones have just recently been discovered. It happen over twenty years ago and the leads are slim. Harry, of course, is not going to give up. His care of one of the boy's bones, laying in a shoebox (he keeps his hand over it as he drives) broke my heart. There is a lot of police procedural and politics in this outing, but I thought it made the story more believable. It also made me appreciate the hard work that the real police do. It is not all glamorous action. The twists and turns in the mystery kept me interested. Just about everything that can go wrong in an investigation, goes wrong in this one. The ending really surprised me. I hope this isn't the last we hear from Harry. I have come to like him very much."
4,A cold case that Bosch won't let go of...,"A body of a young boy found in the hills leads Bosch into pursuing a cold case that leads in a variety of different directions. The boy has been abused and this brings out the avenger in Bosch and he pursues the right solution despite the rush to close. This rush creates errors ending in suicide and false leads. There's is also a new love interest for Bosch which becomes an integral part of the shocking turn of events. By the time you get to the end of the case, it's not as much of a surprise as a rueful understanding of just how these things often turn out. Connelly keeps some of Bosch's more out-there personality traits under wraps; his ""man against the system"" attitude more believably portrayed and it works to the book's benefit. This is definitely one of the better Bosch cases and will keep you interested until the end."
5,Best in the series...,"This is a must buy and read Harry Bosch book!Harry is at his peak in this one, and I took only one break while reading it. It is non-stop reading and riveting! The plot is an excellent one and as Connelly usual, a very twisty ending (unexpected).This is for any mystery fan really - honestly. The title signifies a horror found in the hills, and Harry must work to solve this one. Despite the usual struggles, Harry works out the obstacles his own way, in his own fashion, and some of it hurts. But true to the Bosch vernacular, Harry tracks down the bones and his own ghosts. Buy it! Read it! Then buy the whole series and read them from the beginning to the newest!"
5,Once again a top book,"Once again Michael Connelly has written a great book. Unlike other authors, his books remain consistently excellent. On one hand you want to get to the end to find out the result which is good, but that means the book is over which is bad."
4,Great read,"This book is one of Connelly's best and is more along the lines of Concrete Blonde, The Last Coyote, etc. The characters are well developed and the storyline is intelligent and fast-paced. I liked this book better than Void Moon, Black Ice or any of his science fiction genre efforts for those reasons. If you already like Connelly's stuff, you will really enjoy this one. If you're looking at him for the first time, it's similar to the ""Prey"" series by John Sandford. Connelly keeps you in suspense as to the identity of the villain until the end, whereas Sandford shares the chase from the villain's perspective and you know who did it all along."
3,"It was ""ok""","The story was tragic and all over the place. I had some problems following it. But then I hate it when a good looking chick dies, especially so early in the book. Over all it's a good read though."
3,I really tried to but I couldnt,"I really tried to like this. I wanted to. I gave the book several hundred pages to hook me but it left me feeling flat. As others have said the book has plenty of flaws, leaves lots of loose ends and doesn't accomplish what you think it will. The end falls flat. I'm not giving up on Connelly. Connelly is surely a good writer, this just isn't his best stuff."
3,DISAPPOINTING BOSCH,"The title CITY OF BONES comes from an archaeological discovery of the bones of a person apparently murdered perhaps a thousand years ago in the area around Hollywood. This, of course, is a metaphor for the recently discovered bones of a child murdered ten years ago that sets detective Bosch on another case. I find this to be a rather tepid Bosch novel. The case itself was not particularly interesting nor where there any significant villians to the piece. It was kind of a ""ho hum"" and routine case to Bosch and the book seemed ho hum and undistinguished to me. Still a Connelly fan, I will approach the next Bosch book with hope for a better read as I like the tough-minded, independent spirit of the character Bosch. But it takes more than character to sustain the reader through 393 (hardback) pages."
3,Mediocre 'them bones'!!,"I got 'hooked' on Harry Bosch & Michael Connelly merely two years ago and have found it nearlyimpossible to 'put down' his offerings; however, CITY OF BONES was the first (and I've read nearlyall of them) I was tempted to 'stop turning the pages!' Unfortunately, after a tedious workup to avery sick abusive child molester as the murderer, he devises the ultimate anti-climax in 'outing'the killer. This book is surely not up to his usual standards. It's simply 'ho-hum'!"
3,A sad tale,An interesting Harry story but it only appears to be available in an abridge edition. I prefer unabridged editions.
4,"Great acting, in a solid Hollywood bio-pic that might have gone deeper","An interesting and well acted mainstream bio-pic.Sissy Spacek is amazing as Loretta Lynn - all the moreso for doing her own singing (as did Beverly D'Angeloas Patsy Cline). Tommy Lee Jones shows more charmthan he's almost ever been allowed to since.But in the end, it is indeed a Hollywood bio-pic, withoutany great overriding themes or ideas, except to tell thestory of a fascinating woman's life one episode at a time.A solid film, but not a great one."
5,Forgot How good this was!!!!!!! and still is!,"Great Movie, great interviews, great music, actual story line, they just aren't making movies with all of these qualities anymore."
5,DVD RELEASE DATE SET,"May 6, 2003 is the date ""CMD"" will FINALLY be released on DVD. Twenty-three years (!) after it's initial release, one of my favorite films will be given the Collector's Edition treatment. : )""The more I laugh, the hornier I get"""
5,Good starter set,This is an excellent basic starter kit for N scale model railroading. It is good value for money.
2,"Lines from the film don't match music, distract.","Look no further than the Tub Scene track. This hot, sexy scene has great music. Why would you buy this CD if you didn't like this track? At the end of this piece, the last thirty seconds are overlaid with dialogue from another scene entirely. Remember when J.Lo has to listen to that creep talk about Toughie the dog and how he would tussle with her, and give her a bone? Those sick lines are the last thirty seconds of the Tub Scene track.The other tracks are also affected. Hopefully David Holmes will one day offer a pure version of this album for download from online-only music stores, since producing a second CD would cost too much."
4,For a smooth background soundtrack to your own life....,"I could handle the sprinkling of dialogue - and tell me you didn't smile hearing Steve Zahn's whiny voice complaining like a three year old that he had been sitting there for over a half hour?There is a flavour to this soundtrack that instantly picks ones mood in an upward direction. This is music not often seen in Hollywood blockbuster types and so should be relished. When playing it on community radio I received the pleasantries of enthusiastic comments from all of a 13 year old, late fifties Jazz fanatic for whom ""Watermelon Man"" brought back memories, and a twenty seven year old who just plain loved the flick. The light jazz, deep moody beats and seemingly inappropriate Dean Martin number coming out of nowhere all make this soundtrack a delightful package. And I think that's fun..."
3,"Great music, annoying dialogue","This is one of those albums you want to excerpt for a mix tape as soon as you get it home. Partly because it has some really great songs on it (the instrumentals are almost as much fun as the oldies), but mostly because some putz thought it would be a good idea to interrupt or overlap almost every cut with bits of dialogue from the movie.Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie. It's just that I really would have liked to put this on when friends are over, or whatever, without them thinking I left the TV on. Who wants to hear even the choicest movie quotes over and over? Dean Martin's ""Ain't That A Kick in the Head"" may be the unkindest cut - the last line of the song is cut off by radio static. Was that in the movie? Nope. It seems to be amputated just to match the rest of the album.Bad idea."
5,Loved It,Black Beauty is my favorite book. I have read it six+ times and highly recommened this book to any horse lovers.
3,Wanted original book,not a watered down version...however I thought the print was very small for a young child have not heard if she is enjoying it
4,Children's Classic,"Told from the viewpoint of the horse (""Black Beauty""), this is a story about the trials and travails of an English horse. ""Black Beauty"" has a very hard life, but the book has a happy ending of sorts. My only criticism is that, from time to time, other horses get to tell their stories too, and it is difficult to tell which one is speaking. This makes the book hard to follow, particularly if the reader is a child. The book also makes overmuch use of the flashback. I am told that the book did as much as anything to discourage the use of the bearing rein (check rein) in England; if that is true, it accomplished a good deal indeed."
5,This kindle book helped me relive a portion of my childhood.,"I read this book when I was in elemetary school. The terrific bargain of Kindle helped me get it back into my possession. It is an interesting sad and happy book told from the horse's perspective about human kindness, cruelty, and redemption."
5,Truly a classic,"One of the best known books, almost everyone has heard of Black Beauty. The story is told from Black Beauty's point of view giving a totally different view of the world. He has to endure some cruel owners but remains hopeful that someday things will turn out better. One of the sad parts is the death of his over-worked friend 'Ginger'.The hero horse is eventually saved by a kind boy and his grandfather who care for him and restore him to health. It is quite sad in part but does have a happy ending and in its day would have had an effect on the treatment suffered by working horses.Another brilliant book:GODSTONE - THE KAIROS BOXES"
4,Lucky in Lille!,"This captures a charming performance by this hugely talented guy and his wonderful band. With the band's repertoire exhausted by the serial encores, they end with a straight out of the garage rendition of ""Cinnamon Girl,"" with Hawksley on the drums."
2,Bad news - lots of static and poor quality,"It LOOKS like a good product, right? Yet it is not. I used this device for 3 days before having to return it. Most of the tiem you can hear the other person, but they can *barely* hear you. And G-d forbid you have to use it in the *slightest* of windy conditions - you won't be able to hear anything and the other person will think you are sitting on the wing of an airplane. Skip this product folks..."
2,appearances,"this was recommended to me. nice design...but the sound is mediocre. compare it to the included nokia earpiece! i wanted a ""boom mic"", but the sound for me (& for those i've called) is shrill, & not very clear.waste of $."
3,alright sequel,"this one is more gorier than the rest.that's why i gave it three.if it werent for that and breif comedy and nudity i would have given it one or two.this movie really should have been in scifi section but since the previous sequels were horror they all had to be on the same shelf.worth maybe one rent.the 1st-3rd were better,though.see them"
2,Mindless and Low-Budget,"In all honesty, I love the leprechaun movies. The first was so funny and Jennifer Aniston was a riot. But this movie was terrible. It probobly had the lowest budget of the 5. The sets were stupid and unrealistic and the acting was terrible. Especially be Rebecca Carlton, the princess. This movie was also really not well written and had no clever death scenes at all. The movie was simply pointless and oh yeh, the special effects... were even worse. Avoid this movie at all costs... If you want to see a really well-done, huge-budget horror flick in outer space, then rent Jason X, which is very entertaining. I love it."
3,A'ight,"I loved it when it came out long ago, but I hadn't listened to it in a great long time and bought another copy. This isn't a terribly good album anymore. It's just too dated for my tastes. They are quirky in later albums. This isn't quirky so much as just kinna' bad. Intelligent enough for a teenager, but I'm not a teenager anymore, and this just doesn't work anymore. But, it does have the raw energy of wildly enthusiastic young punkers. I tend to think of these guys as badly overlooked, but this album isn't the reason why."
4,Super Sticky Once or Twice,"Super Sticky PostItNotes are super sticky, but they do not seem to be super sticky more than once.I use PostItNotes for outlining and project management, and I need to place, remove, place, and remove my PostItNotes over and over. I just don't feel that these will work as well as my regular PostItNotes.-----BUT-----They will stick and do stick to the un-ordinary better than the regulars!!!"
4,Country Music and its Culture,An interesting look at Country Music and the attitudes of the people who created it.
5,AWESOME,"I just replied to the reviewer who posted the review about sending a ""moron"" to do the job. Below is the comment I posted to his review. Oh, and 12 Monkeys was AWESOME! Must See!!<<Are you nuts? He wasn't a ""moron"" as you say. In fact, he was quite smart if you had bothered to pay attention. He became ""confused"" not knowing what was 'reality' and what was not, which is EXACTLY what the directors wanted to portray. DUH! 5 star film all the way...one of best SCI flicks of the 90's if not all time.....a WONDERFUL acting performance by Willis and a movie you can watch over and over without ever getting tired of it.>>"
4,confusing in a good way,"This movie kept me thinking. It is set in both the near future and the present. Brad Pitt does an excellent job of acting. I definitely thought he was crazy. There are points in this movie that are very strange. But in the end when you look back on it as a whole, it is all good. If you like strange movies that don't make sense until the last scene, then this is your type of movie. It does just that. You can guess throughout the movie and frequently change your mind and you will still be surprised in the end. I like it that way. I gave this movie four out of five stars."
5,love this movie,hd movies are so cheap now this is a great movie. unfortunately no more hd movies being produced but oh well. this one is great
5,12 monkeys captures the sense of some of my dreams,"This movie made me fall a little in love with Bruce Willis and made me take Brad Pitt more seriously as an actor. If you're looking for the basic sci-fi time travel flick to kill a couple of hours, this isn't the movie for it. There's a strange sense of hopelessness that will stay with you for days in this well-crafted piece of science and-dare i say-romance."
2,"More Duel, Less Drool....","Ok so Bruce looks fab naked and not afraid to slobber in every scene and act barbaric, guess those goons from the future will do that to ya... the whole timeline is absurd, conflicting, and arbitrary so I assume the confusion masks the weak script... the long protracted chase scenes were unbearable and just wanted to see more action and lead flying.... a Brad Snatch teaser imho, coulda done w/o his input but a headliner nonetheless... Madeline looks gorgeous as a blond and Bruce with a wig is hot! incessant discomfort, discord and disorientation makes for commercial yearning.... GEICO! ;}}"
2,Brad was the only hilight,"I thought I was going to be watching a very special movie based on all of the hype and reviews. I wasn't looking for a Die Hard movie and had no real expectations beyond what I mentioned. I was really disappointed with how disjointed it was and to be quite honest, the lousy acting. The only real joy was Brad Pitt. I don't normally consider myself a Pitt fan, and, I didn't realize he was actually in it. He stands out in this move where I think Bruce essentially mailed it in."
4,Thought-provoking,I read this book some years ago. It was very easy to read and it cleared up a lot of things that I was curious about concerning the father of my children. This book is a vey good tool for men or women.
5,great deal,"I could not locate any copies where they said to shop, went online and found a new book at less than what the store wanted to order me a copy. Had it in less than a week."
4,Good Read,"This book was a pleasure to read. After I finished, I passed it on to a friend. Enjoyable!"
2,Who is Reading this?,I think the material in this audio book is amazing.I have a hard time getting through it because of the actor chosen to read the text.His voice and affectations are beyond annoying.I wish careful consideration would be given when it comes to choosing who is to read for the audio book!
3,Broken Silence,This is a very good book. I still believe what he said was true. The people that don't want us to know the truth will say it is not so. It is worth reading.
1,Failed,"Although merchandise arrived quicker than promised, and the color was perfect, the socks didn't even last through one baseball game.........lousy product!!!"
1,Dawn fans are surely weeping,"What a disappointment. I know they're Prince fans but even he couldn't get away releasing a CD as bad ""Dearest"". This might have been an okay CD if they had never released ""Wept"". Expectations were much greater, sorry."
5,Has there ever been an album like this before?,"This is they're last full length commercial release. They released a thousand or so copies directly to fans of another album. But they were forced to stop because of sampling/legal issue's. Dearest Christian... is beautifully honest and very well crafted smooth pop music. Original lyric's, beautifully arranged music. I wouldn't say it is dark...just very sad at times. But there is so much that breaks through that keeps it from ever becoming dark. The album ends with Prince Be talking softly and candidly with his son whom is trying to pull him away from his work in the studio... ""Are you finished with you're la la's da da?"" ... ""yeah, I'm finished with my la la's."" very sad ending. All the stores I've checked over the last year or so have even pulled they're P.M. Dawn tags from the cd racks. If this is they're last effort. It was they're best."
2,Not waterproof,"I bought this product a few months ago. My son plays both football and baseball. The cover works to keep the clay out of my seats. However, when I came back from one of my son's football practice I discovered that the seat was drenched. I was very disappointed because the manufacturer's website claims that this product is waterproof. I also live near the coast and planned to use it when we go to the beach. I will have to look for another solution ..."
2,Does not hold up under pressure,I purchased these shoes because I've always trusted capezio but the shoes just do not hold up well at all. I use them twice a week and have for the last 5 weeks and they already look awful like i've had them for years. The gathering on the bottom is beginning to come undone already too. I would suggest looking for a better model of shoe.
3,the size is not the same,I found that the size is not the same in all models because my doughter have anothers from tha same brand and thisa one dosn't correspond whit the size
3,Mountain Hardwear WindStopper Tech Pant,"The pant is ok...Personally I think the reviews I red about it were excessive...the quality of the leg zipper is lower than expected and the internal velcro for the suspenders in unbearable over the skin...bad design. I may be biased/spoiled by the quality/performance of the Arc'Teryx stuff I own...other products from Mountain Hardware that I have are closer in quality to Arc'Teryx, but not this one. I have to say thought that this is a unique product that it is not easy to find in other makers, very versatile. I am reasonably happy with the purchase and I am planing to use it a lot."
1,0 STARS: Very unconvincing.,"While watching ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre- The Next Generation"", it became apparent to me very early on that this movie just did not have the ""TCM"" feel to it at all. The atmosphere was not there, and the result was an artificial movie that just never got off the ground. Moreover, the acting was unconvincing (to put it kindly), especially Matthew McConnahay, who was poorly casted in his role, although he did try to pull it off. Because the movie was so poorly casted, the execution was terrible. The result is a generic movie that is lackluster and subpar in quality. ""TCM-The Next Generation"" lacks spirit, heart and charisma...it has no character and is deficient in every conceivable area. A very sad and disappointing addition to the series that has taken a nose-dive since the original classic."
1,One of the WORST horror films EVER!!!,"When I first heard of this movie, I was exicited. I was kinda disapointed when I learned that Tobe Hooper wasn't directing it, but I realized that it had the next best thing, which was Kim Henkel, co-writer of the orignal TCM. I was also interested in seeing two good actors (Matthew and Zellwegger) appear in a horror series which never really contained any big stars (besides Dennis Hopper).I thought that this had the making of a good sequel, but I was sadly,SADLY mistaken. This movie is terrible. Surprisely, the acting is horrible, and the plot is stupid. This not just an awful movie, but it's just so disappointing too. I expected too much, I guess. This movie is easily the worst of all the TCM sequels. And that is not a good thing because all the sequels are bad as well"
1,REALLY BAD 1.5 STARS,"The fourth installment ( if you want to call it that ) in the texas chainsaw massacre movies. The first 3 were brilliant horror masterpieces, this one is a joke. I hate to include this or consider this texas chainsaw massacre cause it would be a insult. THis is more of a parady ( a bad one ) of the first 3. Starring Rene Zellweger and Matthew Mcconaughey. Leatherface looked stupid and wasnt scary at all. He dressed up as a woman and wore make up. I know it sounds good but it isnt. The plot sucked, I made the mistake of buying this , I shouldve listened to the other reviewers. This movie is stupid , dont buy it."
4,enjoyable twisted comedy,"there's a lot to love about this chainsaw. velmer is over the top and having a top notch actress like renee tortured in this thing makes it even more entertaining. tons of comedic bits abound. i for one loved the vegetarian pizza bit especially since the pizza idea first popped up in part 3 and then to have it be a veggie pizza is just too damned funny! tcmng is so ""bad"" it's beautiful!"
1,Waist of plastic,"Started out fun and campy, and I enjoyed the lesbian innuendo near the beginning, but then it just got stupid."
3,too weird for words!!,wow! this is some weird stuff! i have no idea what to make of this. it's very off the wall. a lot of it is very funny. over all it's really fun to watch. it's just soo weird!
2,"Boasted as the ""real sequel""","So it said on the promo reel (which was never released) about this Texas Chainsaw flic by the story writer of the original (Kim Henkel). If you ask me that sounds a little bitter.Really, if your into a movie full of excessive violence at the expense of plot (Hey aren't we all?) Then pick this film up. It's not much for anything else.I think the only thing this movie had going for it is:1.) Renee Zelwegger getting brutalized constantlyand2.) Mathew McConaughey getting hit in the face with an airplane prepeller.Other than that, it doesn't have much else... No wait!! It also stars Robert Jacks! Who we all remember played the club owner in that movie Slacker....... Okay okay, I pulled that IMDB.. But still.. ROBERT JACKS!!"
1,Are you kidding me?,"At first I was no fan of the origional, but now i enjoy it a lot, and the remake is a fun time, but this..!!! What was Hollywood thinking? This has to be the worst sequel in the series! And most of the ones after the origional werent too great to begin with, but this is pure garbage! Im not smacking the fans who enjoy this movie, it's just not my cup of tea so to speak. But if some people like it, that's good enough, this just was a huge let down for me."
2,The Texas Chainsaw Massacre: The Next Generation,"This one was Ok. It could have been much better. Leatherface was dumb in this one. All he does is put on lipstick and women clothes. It als turns the whole thing around. In the first one The Massacre controlled the other bad people but in this one the bad people Control him! But it was Ok. It was NOT good and NOT bad. That is why I gave it a 2 stars. But it was definitely Not as gruesome and bloody as the first and second -in fact it was not bloody at all. And it had some modern, teen humor in it! It is not worth seeing if you want to be so scared that you can't sleep for 2 weeks straight! Definitely not."
3,Best of the sequels,"While nowhere near as scary or intense as the original, this sequel manages to capture more of the first film's insanity than the previous two sequels. A lot of fun."
1,Strange,"This movie is really terrible. I watched all the original ones and this comes nowhere near as scary or interesting. A high school geek's friends get killed by backwoods people, and she manages to get away.Little Red Ridinghood is scarier!"
1,What a f**kin' piece of s**t!,"It's been a long time since I've watch a terrible movie like this. The actors are terrible, and Leatherface is ? . This movie cannot be related to any of the previous films. The story and the idea-yeah!, but not the characters and the action. This movie is psychological stupid, with no point at all. It's not a Chainsaw Massacre, it's a stupid Transvesite who thinks he's gonna scare people with an old chainsaw. And believe me, you don't get scared. STAY AWAY!"
1,OH MY GOSH,This is one of the most worst movies i have ever seen. this accomplishes everything accept brilliance and plain out entertainment. Its boring and has no plot. DO NOT SEE this movie it aint worth your money!!!!!
1,don't do it,"DO NOT, and I repeat, DO NOT buy this movie. If you are a movie buff like myself and enjoy good horror movies, pass this one up. The original Texas Chainsaw Massacre is one of my favorite movies and the next generation should not even carry it's name.... all they have in common is that it takes place in texas and there is a character called Leatherface in them. If you want to see a great horror movie buy the classic.. None better."
1,A Hilarious Movie. Not Worth The Film It Was Shot On.,"This movie is a joke. Leatherface has turned into a fat, gay, crossdresser, who screams like he's in Deliverence every time he's on screen. There's a girl who must be related to Michael Myers cause she has about 10 lives. Matt McConaughey is an idiot with a robotic leg with which he moves with a remote control. Who writes this garbage, honestly? They spent the entire budget for the light on McConaughey's tow truck. To quote Chris Rock, ""I've seen better actin' in Tough Actin' Tinactin"" Why can't we give negative stars? If I were Renee Zellweger & Matthew McConaughey I would have paid good money not to have this movie seen the light of day."
1,This is why horror gets a bad name,"This movie is complete trash. This is supposed to be funny? It's not one of those ""it's so bad it's funny"". This is ""it's so bad I'm embarrassed that humans made this movie""."
2,alright,"This chainsaw sequel was Ok. I really honestly think it could have been a all around better sequel, with the setup and characters and all. But come on leatherface was an idiot.They made him look like such a joke in this one. I mean the last half hour all you see of leatherface is him getting dressed up in his nice little woman mask and clothes and see him at the dinner table putting lipstick on about 10 times.i mean just look at the cover of the movie, that explains alot. There were some good, scary chase scenes, and when we see leather the first time with his cool mask on its pretty neat. Besides that it kinda goes down hill. This movie in no way compares to the fun, and scary original or even parts 2 and 3 which werent too bad.."
1,NOT SCARY,"A bloodless, totally unfrightening sequel. If you want a scary movie, I recomend: Carrie, Last House on the Left, the original Texas chainsaw massacre, Hellraiser, Aliens, or Halloween parts 1 and 4."
4,fun to watch,"itz tru this izn't az scary az tha original texas chainsaw massacre, but i've allways found this movie very entertaining. Matthew McConaughey was brilliant in this. dude waz straight up psycho. this is horror/dark comedy. if your looking for something az scary az tha original then dont get this, but if ur lookin 4 somethin entertaining and fun to watch i highly reccomend this."
1,A Big Waste of Valuable Time!!!,"I bought this 6 years ago because the remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre was coming out. When I watched it, I thought it sucked and had stupid situations and Leatherface looked like a girl. Stick with the original, the remake, and the prequel. Not this! I would NOT recommend THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE: THE NEXT GENERATION!!!"
1,Schizophrenics could make up a more intelligible story.,"I liked the first three films, though the latter two never came close to the original. This one however has got to be one of the worst movies ever made, or at least a runner up.It has no real story to it, just a group of backwoods rednecks displaying their bad acting skills. What passes as the plot could have been written by the John Birch Society, only they are much more entertaining.Check out the first 3 and the Troma film, Mothers Day, but stay away from this one if you value your time and money."
2,Incredible Confusion,"I haven't viewed this product. In fact, from the descriptions and reviews, I can't tell what product is even offered for sale here. The title is the English Civil War (which is what I was looking for). But, the description says it's about the American Civil War. And the reviews are split between talking about the English Civil War and Charles I and the Spanish Civil War! How could such a confused and confusing web page have come to on Amazon? For shame!"
5,excellent product great to find it here on Amazon,"I needed these specific nails since I am building a house by myself. Both local hardware stores are supplied only by Ace and they don't carry these nails. Ace Hardware has diminished the choices offered at hardware stores and making finding a product like this require a mail order purchase. Our Ace stores sell every nail and screw by the piece whether you buy one nail or a one hundred piece box.With these nails, I should be able to get the house that I designed - framed."
3,"Okay Watch, Beware of the Band","Watch was given to me as a gift. Very excited once I saw it. It has the perfect look. Rugged yet refined. Liked the Digital and Analog style. The watch itself works great. However, the real problem with this watch is the band. The band is not only ugly (its a shiny brown, a far cry from the ruggedness that the face portrays. The band is also very uncomfortable on the wrist. It is scratchy and somewhat of a nuisance to wear. I find myself constantly adjusting the band to keep it from scratching/agitating my wrist. I am returning the watch and will be getting the Timex T49101 watchTimex Men's T49101 Expedition Camper Watchin its place. This watch is a real shame, it had such promise before I put it on.If you buy it, be prepared to change the band on it."
1,disappointed,When it first arrived -- it was easy to set up using the enclosed instructions and worked well.After a couple of weeks of wearing the watch one of the control buttons simply dropped off of it. This made it impossible to change any of the functions.I was most impressed with Amazon's handling of the return and crediting the account.
2,13 month failure,"Purchased Feb 2011. Seemed durable. Good weekend / Travel watch. light.March 2012 (one year warranty) the hands stopped. Indiglo and digital clock work. Alarm and stop watch also still work. Will try new battery, but would not buy again."
1,very dissapointing,"This watch has been highly disappointing. The entire watch froze up about a month after I first got it. I have received three replacements, one was completely dead when I got it, the other two died within a month. Timex doesn't charge anything to send the watch back, just go to Wal-Mart and they will get you a yellow mailer to put your watch in. I am about to send my watch back again, due to the same freezing up problem. I have written a letter complaining about what a terrible product this is, and will fill keep you updated on how the next replacement goes."
1,NEVER AGAIN,"The only time I was highly disappointed with amazon. I never got the product. It truly is a great product, just wish that I could have gotten it."
2,Analog loses time every Day! :(,I bought this as a backup while my everyday Citizens dive watch was being serviced. I figured an inexpensive Timex would work good. Well I was surprised when I started noticing that every other day or so I had to reset the analog time on the watch. The digital time holds up but apparently they are not linked. I'd try another model perhaps
5,nice watch -- what I was looking for,nice watch --- I like it as it is not too big and does not weigh much at all. So far....so good!!
2,Okay,The CD is okay...but its not worth buying there are three much better albums that are worth your hard earned dollars:Performer / Album / ASINMariachi Vargas de Tecalitlan / Aniversario 100 / B00000160KMariachi Los Camperos / Viva el Mariachi / B00006BXKBMariachi Cobre / Mariachi Cobre / B0000018XP
3,This version has extra footage,"For those looking for what I thought of this film, I earlier wrote a review of the VHS edition, which was released by Paramount and runs 105 minutes. This DVD version is 122 minutes and my copy says it is from Lions Gate, not Front Row.I don't particularly like this film, nor this version of the Harry Palmer character (incidently, even though it suggests otherwise, this has nothing to do with anything written by Len Deighton). I know it's a bit like that old joke where someone complains about how terrible food in a restauramt is, and then also complains that the portions are too small. But if you like this film, or are a Michael Caine completist, I thought it my duty to share the information about the additional footage."
3,Great Movie,"British actor Michael Caine made several sequence of this espionage movies. They are really good since they are made with suspence, intellectually challenge, and without the typical Hollywood jargon. The scenes are all in Europe with a small cast. Not bad for a weekend movie!"
5,I love this cd so much.,"This cd is my joy went I'am lonely, sad, happy, or if I need some thing to listen to everyday. Every song is lovely. R. Kelly is trutly the man because this album is hot. I love evey song and I like the way he put it to together. GREAT JOB! keep it up baby."
1,wuz up wit this cd,"i cant believe you people would pay money to get this cd. the only good song on the cd is ""did you ever think"" (feat. nas), and the only reason it's any good is because of nas. if you don't have this cd, use your money on a nas, 2pac or other good RAP cd."
3,Just a Okay 2 Disc Set...,"First everyone knows that R.Kelly is a music Genius he is the only that can make a nasty song make so beautiful. The Best example is: ""Half On A Baby"". But even with all of his success of his Classic Albums(From ""Born in to the 90`s"" to ""Chocolate Factory"")this album is just okay. I tell the first disc of this double CD album is just makes this a ALBUM TO REMEMBER...BUT the second one only has about 4 good songs on it. So is up to you to pick this one up. If yiu ask me: Is a very diverse album with a lot of genres mixed in one 2 Disc Set. RECOMENDED...BUT IS JUST A OKAY ALBUM, SO IS YOUR DECISION...!!!"
2,annoying,"I usually enjoy a Tom Berenger movie but was disappointed with this one. Tom Berenger (jungle dude and sniper) and the other guy (a government twit sent along to pester Tom and cause all sorts of trouble, kind of like an armed George Stephanopolous) are sent to Panama to 'take out' a bad guy. The problem is Miller (government guy) doesn't seem to know much of anything and refuses to listen to someone who does (Berenger). After a while, this became annoying and I kept waiting for Tom to whack him over the head with something. Unfortunately, he never does. In a scene where they are sneaking through a barnyard, I was waiting for Miller to step on a chicken when he was walking backwards-SQUAWK!! Neat parts of the movie are when Tom Berenger disguises himself as a haystack and watching the Panamanian militia run through the jungle like a bunch of squirrels. I gave this movie 2 stars because you get to watch Tom Berenger."
2,Cliched and mediocre,"The Bottom Line:With its exploding grass shacks, evil ethnic enemy types, Central American locations and uninspired acting, Sniper often plays more like a boring parody of action movies than a legitimate entry in the genre; unless you're a die-hard fan of Tom Berenger or Billy Zane (do those exist?) I would advise you to stay far away from this unappealing film.2/4"
2,Poor,"Sometimes one (this one anyway) feels like some lightweight viewing. This is so lightweight that your television may have to be weighted down to stop it floating away. Now light-weightedness can go with good quality. Alas, in this case, it doesn't. The 1-D Mr. Berenger appears to possess two expressions, grim and grimmer, not to mention all the charisma of the average cornflake packet. The plot is feeble and unconvincing.The film does have one major selling point - it is vastly better than the staggeringly bad ""Sniper II"". I believe there's a ""Sniper III"". I'm already avoiding the shelves of DVD stores where it might be located, so as to avoid contamination in any way by it.My humble advice; save your money."
1,Load of PAP!,"I can honestly say that this is the most awful film that my backside has had the misfortune of having to sit through! The film drags on and on and on ................. It does not seem to go anywhere, they wonder around the jungle arguing throughout the whole film. One of them freaks out, god knows why? If you want to save yourself some money don't buy this!"
3,"Why not just say ""Peridot colored Beads""?","I actually bought this item thinking that the Peridots were real. (Not having any experience with Peridots.) When my wife asked about them, saying that they looked too clear to be natural, I looked at the ad again. ""Gem type: Peridot"" suggests natural or lab created, but ""Creation Method: Simulated,"" I think, means that there are no gems, only gem colored crystals. Other ads state ""Peridot Colored Crystal,"" which is much more clear. Given my wife's preference, I'd have ruled out natural gems and lab created gems as too expensive or unacceptable in quality before buying this item.The crystals are very pretty; I would have preferred that the fact that the Peridot colored beads were just that be more clear."
5,I wish he would produce another recording like this one.,"I first heard about Hadley Hockensmith back in the early 80's. He was an instrumentalist on many of my favorite Christian albums. Then I discovered the jazz band Kononia that he played with. In 1986 I found the ""Heart Songs"" casette and bought it. I immediately fell in love with it. It put me in another world. I played the casatte so much that I completely wore it out. So that year I had to buy another one. Then I started to allow my friends and family to hear the casette. Everyone who was allowed to borrow it would just keep it for themselves. I had to buy another copy of this recording at least 15-20 times over the past 18 years back in 2001 when my last CD was taken from me I searched the internet for about 1.5 years until I was able to find another original one. This one will never leave me again."
4,what??,"This is one of my favorite series, it was all very well written, but how could it end like that? it was SO predictible, I sure hope that X/1999 and xxxHOLIC don't end that way!! CLAMP I love you but work on the endings!!"
4,The End,"And again we are subjected to CLAMP's one major flaw: endings. Don't get me wrong; I love CLAMP's stories and style, but the way they end their stories invariably invokes a single response: ""Uh, what?"" I liked it. But, plotwise, it was certainly not on par with the rest of the series. Perhaps the fact that I had long since figured out what was going to happen made it that less enjoyable for me.Volume 8, being the last volume, is a tad shorter than the previous seven. If you've been reading with baited breath up until now, as I was, then of course you should pick it up. But don't expect anything life changing."
3,3.5 Stars,"One of Boingo's last albums, songs on this album are often haunting. One never knows what to expect from Oingo Boingo, but on this album, what you don't expect is nothing outrageous. Lyrical content is really quite nice but the verses often repeat so much it ruins the experience. Some songs are annoying with the repeated chorus (particularly ""Glory Be"" and ""Right to Know""). But both are good tracks anyway.This never really struck me as an album but as a compilation of tracks recorded for an album (in fact, at least two were written for movie soundtracks).Good songs, yeah. Bad album, I think."
4,DARK SIDE OF OINGO BOINGO,"This effort is dark and brooding which is surprising for the ultimate party band. Still it grows on you and is worth the price if only for ""When the Lights Go Out"", ""Skin"", and ""Flesh N Blood""."
4,Very good 1970 era progressive rock,"At the insistence of a very good friend, I am replying to the prior review. His comments are, I believe rather unfounded. I understand that Tony Kaye is not on this release, but he certainly is not missed. Peter Banks guitar and key work are very good. The songwriting of both Colin Carter and Ray Bennett more than makes up for Banks low output. Plus a highlight is the improvement in the vocals, which are a plus over the first disc. This is at least as good as the first disc."
1,"Metaphorically Speaking, Silly Similes and Raging Rants","Think metaphor - and think LOTS of them - to the point where the writing becomes a rant. And while I mostly agree with some of the social ranting, this just isn't good literature. It becomes tedious and tiresome and absurd - the run on sentences enough to choke a reader. In the past, I found Mr. Koontz' books to have a clever premise, to be thought provoking, and to have an ""unable to put down"" element. This one I put down quite easily. Actually, Dean Kartoontz seems to be the scary monster that is emerging - too great now for a critical editor that would chop this book in at least half? However ... if you wish to read something that is as tedious as listening in excruciatingly complete detail Grandma's latest surgery and the subsequent ill conceived complications and reverberations and protracted recovery, well, then this might be just the book for you!"
2,I've got to stop buying Koontz novels,"They're just so available. However, the plots just seem to get sillier and sillier. The ""justice brigade"" (or whatever they call themselves)? It's too cartoonish. Luckily I listened to the audio version and was able to get a lot of work done while it played in the background. Since the action moved so slowly -- including the incredibly tedious and copious conversations with Shep -- I could easily tune out periodically without missing anything. Just like you won't be missing much if you don't read the book at all."
1,Could win any poor writing award,"The work of a 12 year-old without talent. Phrases are tediously cobbled with clumsy, inappropriate similies. Story line is absurd. If this were Koontz's first novel, no publisher would touch it."
4,"Grabbed me at the beginning, lulled in the middle, very satisfied with the ending",This book grabbed hold of me with the first paragraph. Any book with the potential of having characters with superpowers is my kind of book. It took this book a while to really take off but when it did.... When you get close to 75 percent through get ready and get comfortable. you wont be able to put it down. And you wont be disappointed in the ending.
1,His worst yet,"I have read and own 15 Dean Koontz books and this is by far his worst. It's boring and with the constant, unrelenting repetitive chanting by its autistic character it's extremely annoying to read. Save your money."
1,Painful,"It is a rare thing for me to give up on a book, I hardly ever even skim read. With this novel however, I went from the determined ""it must get better"" thoughts to ""well I'll skim read this bit"" to ""I give up, where's the bin ?"".There was so much needless description, the process of trawling through all that prose just to discover that it was a hot day or that a burger bar was clean and sterile was just not worth it.Shame, if the book had been trimmed by two thirds I would have been able to finish and sum it up properly."
2,What the heck ???,"I bought this superwinch atv mount for my polaris sportsman 500. It fit the atv just fine, but my superwinch 2500 lb winch holes would not line up with winch mount are you kidding me."
4,easy to install,This mount kit was very easy to install. Took out 6 screws and 4 bolts slid the bracket in and reinstalled the screws and bolts and was done.
3,Baby Only Organic Soy Formula was not a hit,"Baby Only Organic Soy Formula was not a hit. I'm still trying, but I fear he spent too long drinking the similac soy. I had hoped with all the positive reviews he would love this, since he eats and drinks just about anything I put in front of him. Sadly this was not a winner. I have had to resort to mixing it half and half with the similac just so I won't have to throw it out. I was looking forward to going organic, I just wish my baby felt the same."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!,"I fell victim to the ""how bad can it really be"" statement and boy did I get burned. This is by far the worst piece of networking equipment that I have ever touched. I have been in the business 8 years, I am an MCSE in NT and Win2k as well as a CCNA. I say that only to state that I know how to setup networks and this POS box wouldn't even allow a consistent internet connection. Plus, like any good tech, you setup the network then and only then try to add the VPN. Well as soon as you turn on the VPN access in this router the machine completely changes it's local network settings. Do not buy this. Find something else. I'm going to get a firwall/VPN unit then try and add the wireless later. By the way, the tech support was horrible. I actually had to teach them things about networking, which means that they were useless for me."
1,Too many bugs,"I have bought several routers in the past, 3Com, Buffalo, and a few others. This is the first and probably the last Linksys. the firmwear that came with the router was unusable. Upgrading to the latest improved things a lot. I can get most things working now. WPA works, the VPN works mostly. UPnP works OK.On the down side you can't mix WEP and WPA which you can on my other routers, also you can't allocate fixed DHCP to partcular MAC adresses, you have to allocate the machines a fixed IP address, not possible on our laptops.Worst of all, is that we can crash the router from the Internet side with our development software! (It doesn't crash our other routers). This is in the current Firmware revision. This is unforgivable. Avoid!"
4,It works fine,"I read the comments and I can not believe it.I bought It in germany and have done an firmware update. After that it works fine without any problem.VPN Setup was done in 2 minutes and the QuickVPN Client software is doing the rest. It couldn't be easyer. I already bought many linksys products and i love them all. WRV54G is working stable and fast withoug any problem since the last month.Just the EU-Firmware Version had a little problem. After changing someting from the configuration, the router is doing a reboot. After that, the DNS Server isn't working any longer so you have to disconnect and reconnect the WAN connection in the webinerface and it works fine again... normaly you don't change the configuration often so you will have no problem.I recommend this product. It's cheap, stron, fast and works fine!"
4,A STRANGE RECORD BUT WITH TIME YOU WILL LOVE IT TOO,"The first time I heard this record (some 20 years ago) it was a big surprise.both the voices and the musical back ground seemed strange.To make it short more instruments, lower tone for voices (closer to the live sound of Everly voices,those who heard them on stage will see what I mean) a lot of background vocals by musicians, and most of all: a very unusual balance between the band and the everly voices (the band is really loud).This sound is very far from the Nashville earlier recordings.It's also more contemporary.The whole is a little overproduced.my first reaction was ""forget this one"" and that was really a premiere (for me). Now looking back I fully changed my mind, okay it's a surprising Everly record but now I really love many of the songs.So,I recommend to buy this cd having in mind it will take you time to like it but once it started you will LOVE it for ever.I was also surprised it was a clearly shared opinion.Thierry Cordonnier"
3,If your a fan of Pam go for it,"The acting and plotting of this film is just plain boring and pretty terrible. If however, you like to see Pamela Anderson's fantastic body (I do, but it doesn't matke a film), then you'll get something out of this. The T&A is highly enjoyable, but untimently this film feels pointless."
3,Great selection; questionable sound qualtiy,"One can't fault the song selection on this collection. The A and B-sides are presented in chronological order. There are many great ""proto-punk"" classics on this collection. Iggy Pop cited them as a major influence on the Stooges. However, the sound quality and liner notes leave something to be desired. I would love to hear this collection remastered from original source tapes. I would also like to see more information in the liner notes such as recording dates, release dates, personnel, etc. However, the song selection makes this worth having if you are a casual fan of the group."
1,Sized big,Sized a little too big for me other than that I guess I need to grow into itWhich can be used to motivate
4,"JIM ""DANDY"" MORRISON...","This cd gets quite a bit of reviews of Phantom sounding like Jim Morrison, which he does, especially on ""Calm Before The Storm"" (this song sounds like an unreleased gem from The Doors). Phantom (when he sings in his ""other"" voice) reminds me at times of Jim Dandy from Black Oak Arkansas, only the voice, not the music.this is very Doors-ish music with a little bit more guitar. if you are a fan of the Doors or just like obscure 1970's hard rock-prog rock, you will like this cd."
4,"Even if you don't like to read, you'll like this book","The story itself was so engaging that I didn't want to put the book down. The story is unique, the characters are believable,and I really liked the relationship between Laura and her sandman/protector. I've heard some say the story itself was slow but I didn't find it so. I'm not an avid reader. It takes a lot to make me want to finish a book. If you don't like to read, try this book. You might find yourself reading it to the very end, and then wishing for more."
3,Informational,I have always loved the concept of feng shui and this book helped me learn more about it. Since I live in a dorm room at the moment I couldn't really apply it to my life now but when I get my own place (soon) I will definitely be utilizing this book. My mother has already asked to use it herself in her house.
4,Beautiful Book,"This book is easy to read, and as other reviewers mentioned, includes beautiful photographs. I found the 'take action now' summaries at the end of each section very helpful.This book inspired me to declutter a couple of ignored spaces in my house, paint my bathroom, and add a fountain to my fireplace mantle. In the short time since executing just a small percentage of the techniques suggested by the author, unexpected cash has appeared in my life and my fiancé has a job interview at a firm he has been wanted to work at for some time. I can't attribute these events directly to feng shui, but they sure are happy coincidences!"
5,Best Feng Shui Book,"I have read several books on Feng Shui and find this one to be the very best. I am moving in two days and will incorporate so many ideas from this book. I find the book relates to the average American person willing to refine and define one's home. I was most unwilling to put the book down and sleep. Well done, Jayme Barrett."
4,Good,"Very interesting, and easy to understand and follow. The pictures are helpful, though i wish there were more pictures. Would recommend."
4,Good guidelines for Fengshui implementation,Very good examples and steps provided in this book. We have implemented a few of them and the ambience definitely seems to have changed on the positive side.
5,Feng Shui Your Life - GREAT BOOK!,I love my new book Feng Shui Your Life.It arrived in great condition and I'm getting and sharing a lot of info from it. I absolutely love this book!It's a great learning tool and refrence book.It will take a lifetime to absorb all the facts I am finding within this book!I'm finding that Feng Shui is also a lot of fun and inspiration!
4,Great information.,"This book touches on many areas of Feng Shui, and is divided into chapters that are easy to refer back to. Would recommend this book."
2,Dificil man!!,"This book is alright, but buyers take note...this is NOT a book for beginners. It's got some really tricky stuff in here with verbs etc. Good review for the 2nd year student maybe?"
1,The Ultimate Spanish Review and Practice,"I cannot believe that this book is offered as new and original!After receiving it, I discovered it is identical to ESSENTIAL REPASO, which I already have! The only thing different is the cover.I feel totally ripped off paying again for this book. How can you get away with this???Diana Wiener"
3,Nissan ser,I thought it was OEM and not the name. I like to order original equipment for my car other than it looked ok.
1,Worst Corey Haim movie ever,"I have seen all Corey haim movies, and this one by far is the worst thing he ever could have done. Failed humor and failed acting make this a fifteen minute watch(before you throw the tape out the window) I recommend not even bothering to rent this movie. Obviously one of the lowest budget movies in history."
1,I thought I was being punked watching this!!!!,OMG..I have never seen a worse film before. Wierd voices and the comedy jsut wasn't at all funny. Do yourself a favor and don't buy this one.
2,WOW! WHAT A HORRIBLE MOVIE!,"Ok, first off, I love Corey Feldman and Corey Haim, and I love movies, but I almost couldn't even finish this movie. They get fired from their job and kicked out of their apartment, so Feldman's uncle that is an ex-pirate actor magically warps them to his island to become scuba instructors, but his uncle's old on screen nemesis tries to take over the island and blah blah blah. I would like to meet the guy that wrote this script and thougth he had something special. The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because the two Corey's are in it, and both of them rule, they just got caught in a very bad movie."
2,"People miss the point, I think...","1.5/5When they made this flick, the National Lampoon series was pretty much outta funds, outta time, and not nearly as popular as it was during the 70's and 80's. They had literally done everything; hence, the title.No, the joke was squarely on the two Corey's.I think it is unfortunate that they did this to their careers. They were talented until they started thinking they didn't have to work in quality films. You have to take small rolls sometimes...it's the truth.Look at their resumes pre-'90 in comparison to anything post. It is aweful. They still thought they were kids.This film is an atrocity..."
5,Corey Ian Haim R.I.P,ok so Im the biggest Corey Haim fan - so I had to get it and yes it is not the best movie but it does have its moments and at no point did I want to turn it off- It has Corey in it.. Anyways if you are a Corey fan it is a must have..
4,OHIO = GREAT FUNK!,"I don't know what was up with Ohio in the 70's but there was alot of great music coming out of that state. Slave, Ohio Players, Zapp, & Lakeside just to name a few. Sun is maybe the most underrated group of the lot. If you like uptempo, horn heavy funk tunes then this is a great cd for you! There are some slower Earth Wind & Fire type tunes also. I'm amazed at the quality of the music on this cd. (I wasn't very familiar with Sun before this purchase.) These are some gifted musicians. Definitely worth checking out! Great sample of a great funk band!!"
3,Knots,I bought this because Annabeth Gish is in the film. The movie has it's funny moments but the ending cuts the cake!. Check it out!
4,Outstanding,"The Ninth Wave by Eugene Burdick is insightful, powerful, and dramatic. OUTSTANDING. His awareness of politics unfolds in a novel way, if I can say that. I recommend it to anyone who wants to know what really goes on in politics."
1,technical issues,"Unbox is a highly ineffective and frustrating program. It is a terrible Windows-only program that pales in comparison to iTunes ease of use. We downloaded the program, and now it says ""Ready to watch in 28 minutes"". Impossible to use. We will never use Unbox again. Definitely not worth the frustration."
2,Misleading,"Any album that calls itself ""The Very Best"" of an artist is suspect. This one more than most.It stops at about 1972, and completely ignores Mason's most commercially successful period in the late seventies. Oh, and a little band called Traffic!So there's no We Just Disagree, Let It Flow, So High (Rock Me Baby, Roll Me Away).""Very Best"" of Dave Mason? I just disagree.Spend a couple of extra bucks and get the Dave Mason Ultimate Collection."
5,A Must for your library!,"A friend/co-inductive bible study teacher shared his copy of this DVD. All I can say is WOW. This video goes over `church history' on various heresies that have been introduced into the church over time and how the church has dealt with them. The examples used in their explanations will help me as I facilitate adult inductive bible studies. While this DVD obviously gives the history of Calvinism, the value of this DVD is how various people in the past viewed various truths of scripture and the ramifications of misinterpreting / taking out of context what the bible says. This DVD will be in our family library shortly."
5,Great Speakers,"I was blown away at the sound these speakers have, and the price was great considering the excellent quality of these speakers. I highly recommend these speakers."
5,Awesome Sound,These were easy to install (the grill could have been a little easier to attach) and awesome sound! The house really shakes now!
5,Killer deal,"Pretty unbelievable how good these speakers are for the little money they cost. Easy to install, quality product, sound very good. The 8"" has good bass response. And u can direct the tweaters to listening area for better imaging."
4,Great Purchase,Great quality for the price. Installation was very easy using the enclosed template. The tilting tweeter was a nice feature.
4,Lewis is at it again...,"From the author of several fantastic books, comes a great short synopsis leadership, motivation and team dynamics."
3,nice but not great,"Acting decent. Sets were a little shallow. Film quality and audio poor, really needed remastering. Much better series available."
3,For the Long time Carlin Fan,"It is nice to see that ""Take Offs and Put Ons"" has been released on CD. My orginal Vinyl copy of this gem is completely un-listenable. This recording features a younger, less angry George Carlin before he fully developed the sharp social criticism that his more recent shows have featured. And while some of the material may be dated, the ""Wonderful Wino Radio"" routine is still one of his funniest bits ever. If you are a new fan of Carlin, pass on this one till later. But if you know what he sounds like now, check out how he sounded then. It is worth the money."
1,1 is the minimum?,"If I could, I'd give it a zero. I would never ever ever ever ever read a book that cliche. Ever."
3,The Kindle version should NEVER cost more than the paper version.,"It is sad to see the electronic version cost more than paper. It just doesn't seem right. Decent writer, clever marketing."
2,Misleading title,"After a couple of Almedida pieces, including a lovely and all too brief ""Sonata For Guitar and Cello,"" this album quickly degenerates into pop schlock of the worst sort. The ""doo-wa"" female singers, the loud drum, the snappy pieces trying to cash in on the samba craze of the early 1970s...this must be the worst thing Almedia, a wonderful musician, ever recorded."
5,Textbook,Just what I needed! Brand new and cheaper than the bookstores on campus. Glad I found it on Amazon!
5,One of the best from Merchant Ivory,"If you know someone who has not watched this yet, giving them this movie as a gift would make their year. ""Maurice"" is just about the best gay historical fiction on the big screen that there is. A masterpiece from Merchant Ivory! Romantic, sexy and real. You needn't pay retail either; given the age of this movie, there are plenty of used copies about. Though whether the owners can bear to part with them is another question."
5,Simply stated: MAGNIFICENT!,"I could go on for days extolling the virtues of this great film but so many reviews posted here have said it much better than I ever could. I will say this; in this year of the GREAT ""Brokeback Mountain"" and everyone talking about straight actors now being unafraid to play a Gay character we must not forget the superb preformances of the three leads, especially the brilliant and devastating performance by Rupert Graves in this film which was made almost 20 years ago and please let's not forget the electrifying and Oscar winning performance of William Hurt in ""Kiss of The Spider Woman"" back in 1985. By the way, why isn't ""Spiderwoman"" out on DVD?"
3,The movie didn't suck but it's the worst of the serie!!,"Death Wish 1 was the original.Death Wish 2 was action-packed.Death Wish 3 was ""Rambo Time""!Death Wish 4 was ""EXTERMINATION TIME""!!!Death Wish 5 was...A little bit decent. The only GREAT thing that this has that none of the other sequels have is the SLOW-MO shooting!!! \,,/There isn't to much action as the previous sequels and the story is also nothing new. This is the kind of movie that wants to keep the ""High-Action"" until the ending, so you won't see a shooting gallery for a while. The final action scene was pretty cool but many good parts were interrupted by many blah!blah!blah! scenes.For fans of Slow-Mo action movies or Charles Bronson this movie can be very entertaining, but for One Man Army fans or Urban Action War fans then I do NOT recommend this one.Adios."
3,"I didn't have a Death Wish, but I got one for Christmas!","I loved this movie! Like this movie, i had an uncle i wanted killed. my death wish came true, he died of a heart attack. This was all in a dream, mind you, because i cannot distingwish between realtiy and the subconscous mind. MY hand is on fire, oh god it really IS on Fire. If you liked this, dude, you'll like Rad and The Fastest Guitar Alive. I totally want to eat my face, which i just did. I cannnot seeere wqat imm tipineg. radd!@!"
4,Just because Steve Winwood is not on this album doesn't mean it's not good.,"Unfortunately, the Spencer Davis Group will always be seen as a footnote in the career of the great Steve Winwood. When Steve and Muff Winwood left in 1967, Peter York and Spencer Davis decided to continue the band and find replacements. They found Eddie Hardin and Ray Fenwick (who replaced Phil Sawyer after a few months). This version of the band is my personal favorite. By this time, Dee Murray and Nigel Olsson (later with Elton John) had joined to replace Hardin and York, who became a duo. This album contains a lot of variety: progressive, psychedelic, folk, blues... the gamut. Buy it and keep an open mind. It's not a Steve Winwood album, so be fair."
3,Short lived,I keep getting these because they fit my hot tub perfectly as additional weather protection. They last less than a year before they completely fall apart.
3,Too Rushed,The level of instruction on this DVD is perfect for me - my only comment is the poses on this DVD are very rushed. In my local yoga class there is smooth transition between the poses. On this DVD you only hold a pose for a few moments before rushing to the next one - wish I could devise a smooth method to hit the pause button to really enjoy. Good instruction - but only watched the DVD once because of this hurried approach.
4,Good for small offices,"I received an autographed copy of this book from Don Aslett a couple years ago after writing to him in praise of his ""Clutter"" series of books. So huzzah to Don! :-) I found this book, like his others, to be entertaining and eye opening. The only reason for four stars is that it seems geared toward a smaller office, where the decision to pitch files and streamline may be handled a little more easily. I think more space might have been devoted to how to deal with ""bureaucratic"" offices such as mine, where useless stuff must be ""archived"" with the okay of the higher ups. So much stuff I would love to pitch in the trash can, but can't, due to red tape. So someone who has full control of what stays, what goes, might glean more useful advise from this. I particularly enjoyed his office ""types"" list...Homefront Hannah, etc. I think everyone can identify with these."
1,Manchester is unobjective and biased,"You know, I started this book with such high hopes. The narritive was so interesting, but as I progressed, I found the effectiveness of this book obscured by Manchester's prejudiced view of the Church and the people of the Middle Ages. I would strongly recommend checking this book out of the Library before buying it and checking the basic facts out against more reputable authors before accepting any of this man's book as factual or unslanted in the telling of this period of history."
1,A World Lit Only by Fire,"This book stinks! It is full of opinionated inacuracies and crude generalisations. Absolute drivel, just don't buy it! Get Tuckman's A Distant Mirror instead."
4,The Real European History- How Europe became modern Europe,"If you have any interest in the truth about history and why the world came to be the way it is, this is a terrific book. This is the European History equivalent of ""Guns, Germs, and Steel"". It is easy and interesting to read unless you try to remember everything that is in it. Using specfics to bring history to life, I could read this book many times and still find new things in it. This book dispells many myths about the ""march of history"" and the ""role of the Church"" while examining many facets of human nature. While highlighting the contributions made by many individuals, this book serves as a warning to the dangers of religious fundamentalism and self indulgence. The Catholic church would not approve of this book. The book ends by examining the life of Ferdinand Magellan, his beliefs, his preservance, and his amazing success that lead to the ""religious exuberance"" that undermined his judgement and cost him his life."
3,"An excellent historian, but not for this period","Cantor's book on the Medieval Mind is worth reading if you want a professional's amateur opinion. The facts that he presents are not wrong, but but they are narrow. A previous reviewer characterized Cantor's interpretation as ""imaginative."" I certainly agree, but I don't use the term as a compliment in this case. If you're already familiar with this period of history, read ""A World Lit Only by Fire"" for entertainment or for a different view. If you are just getting interested in medieval history, don't take Cantor's conclusions to heart until you've read a few more works by historians whose work is focused on this difficult period."
2,Almost completely unorganized.,He has some useful information but the way it is conveyed is completely unorganized. Jumps around from popes to maglelon.
5,A book to devour; a book to send you back to the bookstore.,"Manchester makes the age come alive. Half-way through the book, I reported to my 80 year old mother who had just finished her re-read of Dante and was ready for a new ""read."" She obtained it and finished it before I did! Loved it. Looking over some of the reviews here by the 'scholars' I am reminded of the definition of an expert: An ""X"" in mathmatics is an unknown factor and a ""spurt"" is a drip under pressure. Perhaps scholarly experts do not wish to read about how out of touch those in power really may be. Read this book!"
5,Great historical reading,"Forget about the nonsense that other reviewers have written, if you like history, this one is a highly entertaining and valuable book. Looking at the criticisms, other readers point out the errors in the book, without giving many concrete examples. They seem so anxious to attack the author that one of them even falsely claims that the facts of Copernicus death are wrong in the book. It looks like the critics cannot stomach very well the attacks of Manchester on the Catholic Church and the Papacy. Too bad! Yes, there may be a few errors here and there. I think that I've detected one: Francis Drake did not take the same straight as Magellan, if I remember well my high school history lessons. But, so what? I've had fun reading the book and I've learned a lot, even if a few dates and facts are not entirely correct."
1,biased and banal,"This author has no real concept of the medieval ages, basing his text on what can only be seen as stereotypes. The author frequently gets his information wrong, and contradicts himself when it is convenient for his exploitative text. As another reader put it, this is ""tabloid literature"" at it's finest. He uses the outdated method of progressive history and speaks in dull metaphors of darkness and light. Read this book only if you want trite and cliché nonsense about an extremely interesting period of history. Absolute trash."
2,Awful,"Manchester's interpretation of the period is certainly original. Indeed, I think that Medieval and Renaissance scholars would dispute much of what he says. The work is shallow, superficial, and at times borders on distortion of fact (for example, the statement that Lucrezia Borgia was having incestuous relations with both her father and her brother, a view which is not widely held). For those who are interested in the Middle Ages or the Renaissance, there are many good books on the market. This isn't one of them. Try ""Daily Living in the Twelfth Century"" by Urban Tigner Holmes, or ""The Black Death"" by Philip Ziegler."
1,Good reading isn't Good Enough,"In reading the previous reviews, it is necessary to point out that good, gripping reading just isn't a good enough criterion for a book about history. Accuracy is first, readability comes after that. Manchester's book isn't accurate. That's a very bad thing for a history book. Be smart: Read what's true rather than sensational. Skip this one and go for the heavy weights, or better yet, go to Amiens or Notre Dame in Paris and still believe that the Middle Ages were dark. You might follow that up with a trip to Auschwitz to see how 'light' an era we now live in."
4,"Interesting, informative, breezy","I am preparing to work my way through the Middle Ages and I felt like this book would be a good start. When I teach myself a subject, I like to start with something basic. For example, if you wanted to do a lot of reading about Ancient Greece, you could watch the movie Troy before you started. You'd learn the names and the pronunciations and then later, while you read, you could associate the allusions made in the later works to images and living characters, rather than sparse memories of your middle school journey through Homer. It's not the most glamorous or scholarly way, but who cares? Aside from those benefits, this book is interesting. Manchester does a wonderful job explaining the humanity of each age, you're left with a grasp on how the people alive back then felt about something, rather than some historians' consensus on an event. You can't really ask for more from a book."
2,Anti-Catholic diatribe,"Not much to say here. Manchester's not a professional historian, has no particular expertise in this period of history, and occasionally gets his facts wrong. Far worse, however, is the fact that he lets his hatred of Catholicism run wild. He's so bigoted that his interpretations are suspect and his conclusions absurd. If you're looking for a quick read that confirms your personal prejudices against the Catholic church, then this is the book for you. If you're looking for something a bit less biased, then I'd suggest you look elsewhere."
4,Usefull reading if you're going to travel to Prague,"Because I would be spending a semester studying in Prague, I decided to pick up Douglas Lytle's book. I must say I was very pleased with the results. Lytle writes like a good friend, filling you in on the social and political climate of the country without ever coming off as boring professor. Lytle managed to change my attitude towards Prague (that being from a kid only concerned about partying and going out to someone who is actually concerned and interested in a foreign culture) and for that alone i am gratefull. Lytle is first and foremost a reporter, and that is often revealed in the way he tells his story. All in all, i would label the book essential to anyone planning on spending any significant time in the Czech Republic."
2,Not worth the money,"I bought this book thinking it would make a nice addition to some of my other fngerstyle repertoire. Unfortunately, the transcriptions here bear thin resemblance tothe actual recorded versions. Some songs are barely recognisable - try Graceland for example! Disappointing to say the least - taking into consideration these songs are so melodic (hello ?! Paul Simon!!) - these versions are just too off centre."
2,Recon third brake light,"The item I received wasn't as depicted in the picture - It was easy to install but, I was disatisfied that the brightness of the white and red leds wasn't as advertised. If I would of had the time I would or returned the item for my money back."
5,Great new rock band,"Intense guitar, tortured vocals, and melancholy ambiance... what's not to love! These guys should be a hit for years to come."
1,Do you want to read or look at the art of Da Vinci?,I'm not much of a reader and it's not blatantly spelled out in this book's description BUT if you're looking for a book with DaVinci's art DO NOT LOOK HERE!
4,As intense as the first.,"This is the third in the Charlotte and Thomas Pitt series. It's been two years since their marriage, and I like the way their relationship has grown. Charlotte's simple but happy life is seen here against her sister's more affluent lifestyle. The story is complex, like the first one, with a nice vision of the social system and a not-obvious ending. Interesting and well done. Makes me want to read the next one."
3,"Love Perry, but not Paragon Walk",Although I am a huge fan of Perry -- both the Pitt series and the darker William Monk series -- this one had such an obvious plot flaw from the very beginning I was disappointed. But I'll continue to read Perry's work. I love Charlotte's clever way of getting around the Victorian drawing room manners.
3,A fun read,"These Pitt books are in no way great literature. But they're fun to read and keep me turning the pages. I've read the first three and will probably, in time, read them all, in between reading other things. I enjoy the picture of Victorian London which they present, including descriptions of the gorgeous clothes the leisure-class ladies wore. Anne Perry always drops little hints about who the killer might be, which makes it fun."
4,Nice Twisty Plot,"I am a huge fan of the Inspector Monk series which I honestly still prefer. However, the Pitt novels are equally good, well written and interesting in their period detail. My only slightly negative comment is the lack of detail regarding the Pitts themselvves, their relationship, etc. I can't feel as much empathy for Pitt as you do for Monk with his history. So if you enjoy this series do check out Inspector Monk as well - you won't be disappointed."
3,"Not Her Best, But Still Good","This is not Anne Perry at her best. The characters' motivations don't quite hold together, the plot is a bit shaky, there should have been some thorough editing/proof reading.But Anne Perry, even when not at the top of her form, is still eminently readable; her gift of words never fails to amuse, intrigue, entertain."
3,Wny is food served after a funeral?,"This was not her best book, atleast compared to the first two I read. It was just too watered down with society talk. If you've read the first two you don't need any more lessons on people of society vs. the working class.HOWEVER, I did discover the reasoning of why food is served after a funeral, or atleast it made the most sense of anything I've heard so far and just for that reason the book was worth reading. I'm looking forward to her 4th book in this series, I've become quite attached to these characters."
2,"Great Material, Lousy Production","I ran this on a Dolby AC-3 system and it was TERRIBLE. The music mixing cannot be fixed with system settings. Too bad, if the DVD had been properly produced it would have been a collection piece! -Don't waste you money."
2,Not Happy with DVD,"The picture quality was excellent, however the sound was terrible. Very dissapointing, nothing like her 1st vhs video. Was it my DVD player (Toshiba SD-1200). Other than this DVD I have no complaints with my DVD sound quality. I'm playing through a Sony STR-D915 Dolby Pro Logic surround sound system reciever. The music severely overpowers the vocals in all playback modes. Does anyone have any sugestions?"
3,Shania Twain: Live,"While I am a Shania fan, and I loved the energy of the group, the show, and the songs on this DVD, the sound quality leaves me wanting and wishing. There is way too much crowd noise (for home viewing) for my tastes, and much of the bands music and her vocals are overpowered by the huge crowd and their noisy enthusiasm. It's not the sound quality we've come to expect from DVD.While it's not a dud, it's not equal to a Celine Dion (Colour of My Love)live concert performance--which sounds nearly like studio work--with some audience sounds nicely wrapping (not over powering) the performance.Overall, I'm a little disappointed, and looking forward to the Shania Live: Visual DVD release December 21st."
4,Shania Twain: Live,"Super DVD, very enjoyable. Only disappointment was that it was not recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound."
2,Thank Providence this is no longer manufactured!,"I bought this movie based on the reviews here on Amazon. I guess it depends on what one wants from one's entertainment. For example, if you LOVED the TV series ""The A Team"", this movie will probably interest you. Unfortunately, there's no Mr. T saying things like ""Shut up, fool!""Seriously, the plot was paper-thin, the acting was deplorable, the props and special effects were comical. For instance, do you remember the A Team shooting sophisticated automatic weapons at people standing no more than 20 feet away and missing them completely? Do you remember each explosion tossing people 20 feet in the air with no apparent injury? This movie is along those same lines.I gave it two stars out of pity more than anything else. ""Mercenary"" is a terrible, cheaply-made B-movie to be avoided."
4,Babe Who?,"Babe Ruth, Rory Gallagher and Wishbone Ash are just a few of the performers that came out of the 70's that are still virtually unknown in the U.S.I have a copy of this Babe Ruth on vinyl, picking it up over 20 years ago in the discount rack at some forgotten department store. Although I had never heard of them, 1.99 wasn't much to spend to take a risk. The album is still one of my favorites as I admire the diversity of the music: staight ahead rock, black soul, mexican inspired movie theme music and Jenny Haan-powerful,soulful and gentle.As I am late in discovering that they are now on CD, I am looking forward to listening to them digitally while displaying the album cover with its larger pictures of the band."
3,It's just okay,The puzzles aren't very hard. I started on puzzle 100 and I'm working backward since the ones at the end are supposed to be hardest. I don't find them very challenging. Also the pages are small for Samurai (less than normal copy paper) and I would have liked them a little larger. Not my favorite book.
5,I LOVE THIS BOOK,"After doing Sudoku for several months, I learned about Samurai Sudoku. Now they are the only ones I ever do. Glad to find a book with just them. The difficulty level is from easy to hard. This book is worth the money."
2,Poor Quality,"The quality of this backpack is rather poor and comparable to many that are sold at Walmart for $15.00, so I paid twice as much! The bottom fabric is not sturdy enough to take the daily cramming of schoolbooks, and i doubt will last more than 3-4 months. Actually, I did find one backpack at Walmart that did have a pretty sturdy bottom about a year and a half ago for only $15.00; it finally wore out and since it isn't the beginning of the school year, Walmart's stock of backpacks is too limited at this time. That's why I thought I'd try to buy one online. I'll never do that again. Some things should only be bought in person."
2,Not As Shown,This poster has a large white border (approximately 6 inches) around the entire poster. The printed portion is more like 18 x 24. Disappointing.
2,Forgettable,"The hit title song is the only track with proper vocals on this album, with lyrics written and sung by David Bowie. The Autopsy is a short interlude, Irena's Theme is a long, slow piece, Night Rabbit is an atmospheric excursion with eerie feel and Leopard Tree Dream is a mid tempo number. The pace picks up for Paul's Theme (Jogging Chase), where Giorgio Moroder's characteristic electrobeat first surfaces on this album. The Myth is slow and evocative with a bit of humming by Bowie, whilst To The Bridge is another slow interlude. Transformation Seduction is a fairly interesting uptempo piece and the album concludes with Bring The Prod, a short moody track leading up to a crescendo. Fans of Giorgio Moroder beware! Cat People is nothing like his amazing disco albums From Here To Eternity or E = MC2. It might work well as a soundtrack but offers little in the way of listening pleasure and is in fact quite forgettable."
5,The Best,"Our 24 yr old daughter took this childhood tape with her when she went to college, and now our twin 19s are off and the want it too.I dispared of ever finding it but here it is at AMAZON under books. No wonder I couldnt find it! It is not a boring tape with soprano screechy voices, but lots of different normal sounding people with songs we always remember...Oscar Brand singsLittle Black Cat on this tape, and he rewrote the lyrics in his 1994 tape about Cats, its funny. Parents who have to listen to this tape every night for many years{me} will not be tired of it because there are good lyrics full of thought pictures. I highly reccomend this..."
4,Real McCoy: One More Try,"Ok so the second release from Real McCoy doesn't have the magic their debut album had but it still has it's moments. Their first U.S. release, ""Another Night"" cranked out the hits ""Another Night"" ""Come and Get Your Love"" ""Run Away"",etc.. Their follow up album ""One More Time"", tries to re-capture that same energy but seems to miss. I'm not saying this album is bad...the title track will get any party off on the right track, however, I was craving the solid dance sounds of ""Run Away"" and ""Automatic Lover"" found on the first album. True Real McCoy fans will be satisfied with this release but are looking forward to a new album soon. We'll give Real McCoy one more try."
1,I am appauled,"This movie was the worst movie I have ever seen. However, I saw south park later in the week, so I do award this movie half a star for some aspects. I didn't think that the special effects were that terrible. It actually had a good plot, but It was carried out horridly. I had to take breaks from watching this movie. It just got worse and worse. At the end, I was left in awe and thought, ""I cannot believe I just saw that."" It will assault your taste in movies. Pick up carnosaur 2 instead (I reviewed that too), but just leave this movie alone. Ick"
5,"A Classic (And I Won't Tell What ""Rosebud"" Is!)","This was a movie we had to see in our History of the Cinema class (and the professor warned those who already saw it not to give away the significance of ""Rosebud""!). Orson Welles outdid himself with the direction and the different effects (and made an enemy of William Randolph Hearst, who this film is supposedly about). Beranrd Hermann, who also contributed music for Alfred Hitchcock movies (particularly Psycho) and the Twilight Zone TV series, does an excellent job with the score. For me, the most interesting part of Citizen Kane is seeing the kind of person Charles Foster Kane (Welles) was to others (he is seen as an egomaniac, shallow, lonely, private, and mysterious by each of them). Nobody knows the real Kane in the end, not even the viewer. This is one of those movies you should see at least once in your life (and if you really like it, you should see it again!)."
3,I guess I am going to get a lot of dings for this review!,"I guess that I am one of those who fall into the camp of Citizen Kane was a great movie but its not the be all and end all movie of film history. Considering the time and technology available Orson Welles did a brillant job on William R. Hearst.I shall also acknowledge that it took a lot of guts on the part of all hands involved to go up against the old boy. But they did and made a great film.But I still find it a dated film that covers a period of history that really does not move me like the American Civil War did or some other periods of our nations history. Altogether I rather watch ""Casablanca"",""The Day the Universe Changed"" or Ken Burns ""The Civil War""."
5,"very good, maybe not the best","He was going to find rosebud!For me, the turning point is when Kane is waiting curbside to go to a wherehouse and look through things from his mothers ranch in Colorado. Instead, he decides to fall in love with Susan Alexander.Welles and Mankiewicz prove Charlies self-destruction his self-loathing here. Its so subtle. Kane was terrified of finding his own history, roots, freedom, happiness. He sabotaged his self-discovery. He denied himself the childhood world of play (remember Thatcher's christmas gift of a sled?).Forget the backstory, forget the technology, forget the mood and the ""firsts"" and the black and white.Films live on the writing, and this writing, this storytelling is as good as it gets!"
5,"Classic film, excellent commentary","I had never seen Citizen Kane when I bought this DVD. When I got it, I watched it twice; once for the film, and the second time for Roger Ebert's excellent commentary.Ebert has an obvious enthusiasm for good cinema in general and Citizen Kane in particular. With nearly every shot he provides anecdotes, trivia, and valuable insight. His explanations of the various photographic tricks (deep focus, back projecting, sets that literally split apart to allow for freer camera movement) allow you to appreciate the film on a very technical level."
4,A story to be rembered and shared for generations to come!,Purely cinematogriphal ingenial innovation in every sense of the word!! It brought joy to me; it made me feel pains and terror; and gaves me the chills at time. It had the effect to lighten my heart or bring a vicious attack of ebola unto it. Oh the twisted web we weave......
5,Wonderful,"I loved every minute of this movie. It's a sprawling, heartbreaking story of a man who has everything, but really has nothing. I think it's a story each one of us can watch and learn something from; mainly, what's really important in life, where are priorities really should be. Orson Welles is heartbreaking and brilliant as Charles Foster Kane, and the supporting cast is equally as strong. The filmmaking and use of shadows is clever, and the dialogue fairly quick-paced and witty. All in all, a great story with lots to offer. P.S. I'm in my 20s, so I don't think you need to be a certain age to ""get it."" I guess you just have to be receptive to it, who knows?"
4,Amazon Prime Citizen Kane 70th Anniversary,"Probably the greatest movie ever made. Watch movies on Amazon Prime and love it. But with this movie (and others) the disappointment comes when you realize you can not see any of the features without actually buying the movie. Not just buying the download.... You have to buy the actual disc to see the special features. Netflix, VUDU,Direct TV Cinema, they are all like that. Wish it didn't have to be that way. I think Amazon will quickly become the leader in this fairly new venue."
2,"This a boring movie, but a great documentry,","I know this is supposed to be the greatest movie of all time but I just could not get intreasted in it even though I spent twenty five dollars on the dvd. THe movie is very slow although for a movie made 60 years ago it looks good on dvd. It is just very slow I watched it for a hour and ten minutes and finally took it out. The dvd set was not a complete waste of money though beecause I enjoyed the 2nd disc documentry a lot and found a new formed respect for orson welles. I was looking foward to the War Of The Worlds radio broadcast but can not found it on either of the discs, Does anybody know where its at or if its not on my disc for some reason."
3,legendary by scandal only,"""Citizen Kane"" is heralded by the critics and even given the highest honor by AFI via being awarded ""greatest film of motion picture history"". these are the facts.this is my opinion:i viewed this film years ago on videocassette. i didn't understand then the notoriety sorrounding the film and didn't understand it after viewing it on DVD recently. i was only slightly entertained by a few fleeting moments in the film. overall, i found this film boring and intolerably long.normally i have extreme respect and adoration for the classics except a few, and this is one of those rarities. it merits 3 stars from me only because of the notorious scandal it caused.as for the DVD, it's quality is superb in picture and audio. the extras are more than sufficient. Amazon lists these on thier site."
3,Expecting More...,"CITIZEN KANE is, as everyone knows, one of the great films of cinema. Every serious fan of the movie should own a copy. The film will always be great. The transfer is a good one, the extras on this disc are good too. But the 2 extra discs are pretty dull. The documentary about the making of CITIZEN KANE is moderately interesting but the film that accompanies it, a kind of ""Film-of-the-documentary"", is a real switch-off. I lasted about 15 minutes. It was so slow. Also the casting was pretty much off the mark. So, as ever the film remains a treasure but don't be fooled by this bundle, it's only the main feature that matters. (There are some ""collectibles"" enclosed as well but they didn't seem that collectible to me)."
5,Excellent Film!,"With many movies out there, this one is by far the finest film ever made. The cinematography, directing, and acting are nothing short of superb. Orson Welles is clearly a genius and deserves the highest recognition for his brilliance shown in this film. I sincerely recommend this film to everyone, young and old, for not only the outstanding technical and acting aspects, but because of its beautiful and heartfelt message."
4,A great film.,"Although I don't see how it could rank #1, this is definately a wonderful American classic. Orson Welles was one of the best actors/directors of his day, and this is proved in this first major motion picture. The story of Charles Foster Kane is an intruiging one which captures the audience and keeps it interesting enough thorugh out that only the impatient will get bored. This is a wonderful film and I do highly suggest it to any true film buff."
5,"Not the best, but undeniably incredable","To people who go on long insulting tangents about how overrated this move is, understand that when people say it is the most important movie ever, they do not mean most entertaining. They mean that it literally changed movies forever, and that's no small feat.This is not the best movie ever made, true, but not only is it important, it is entertaining, with great acting right down to the bit parts, a screen play that never drags, and atmosphere enough for anybody."
2,Don't forget to bring a pillow if you decide to see it!,"Absolutely boring! I didn't care what ""rosebud"" is but just painfully waited until it ended. You will not find this film satisfying as you expect. I've found the good reviews here about this film are exaggerated. I strongly believe that the majority of the people who ever see it will consider it as a BAD film. Actually I gave it only 1.5 stars."
3,A dull vision,"Yeah, this movie is a classic, so what? People now days seem to think that if it was black and white and made in the 50's that it's a great movie. Citizen Kane is a sometimes interesting movie about a man's life story very similar to that of William Randolph Hearst. Yet the movie is poorly acted except for Orson Welles (Charles Foster Kane), and the plot isn't very intruiging either. ( A man separated from his parents creates a big newspaper franchise and makes it big, but it falls apart later). The best thing about this movie was the head-scratching mystery of Kane's last word, ""Rosebud""."
1,Arrived Defective,"Even though it was advertised new in its original wrap, the product arrived defective. When I placed it in the VCR, it kept spitting out. I tried everything, rewinding, fast forwarding, to no avail. On the fifth try, the tape caught in the machine, so I stopped trying so as not to break the tape or machine. When I tried to return the tape to the company, they refused to replace it, citing a 30 day return policy. I don't want my money back; just a working video. But no luck. I am a film teacher on a limited budget, so I won't be using this company in the future."
2,I'll save you!,Hey this is the most boringest movie of all time for all of you that want to see it let me save you some time and money! (...) I waited the whole movie to find that out and it was horrible!
1,SPIKE STRIKES BACK,"THIS REVIEW IS LESS ABOUT CITIZEN ""PAIN"" (TO WATCH)AND MORE A FOLLOW UP ON THE RESPONSE TO MY FIRST REVIEW. AS OF 12/2/99, 32 PEOPLE DID NOT FIND MY REVIEW HELPFUL. IS THAT THE BEST YOU CAN DO?"
3,Technical Hodgepodge,"Orson Welles used every techical trick in the book when he filmed Citizen Kane. The effects are interesting and deserve three stars simply because of the juxtaposition of ""all types of all aspects"" of film making into one film. It's all a bit much. ALSO, based on the reviews, I thought this would be a great film. It fails miserably. Charles Foster Kane's belligerent, aggressive, superior and obnoxious attitude lacks sympathy and, as a protagonist, he elicts little pity. Watch the film if you want to answer trivia questions or, better yet, I'll save you the trouble. Rosebud was Charles' sled. The film far too dark and dated. The redeeming qualities are the various lightening and technical aspects."
2,"Uh-oh, here come the NO HELP votes","Yes I know, you're about to vote thumbs down on my review of Citizen Kane. So be it. This movie was called the greatest movie of all time. Why? Because Orson Welles is supposed to be a genius and this is supposed to be his masterpiece? It's a long, boring movie, poorly directed, choppy, and annoying. The reaction to this movie reminds me of the story of the emperor with no clothes on. There's nothing here to rave about. How can you put this in a class with African Queen, Casablanca, and the other truly fine flicks?"
3,Innovation Has Become Commonplace,"It is easy to see why cinema historians consider 'Citizen Kane' a landmark film; unfortunately, like the equally famous 'Birth of a Nation,' the technical innovations which made the film seem so stunning in the 1940s have now become rather commonplace, and it will be difficult for most casual viewers to understand what all the fuss is about. Film buffs, cinema students, and movie historians will find much to interest them here... but the casual viewer will find 'Citizen Kane' of only mild interest."
4,GREAT BOOK,"I love these Schaum books, but I feel like they leave gaps in their explanation to problems. They also have a bunch of errors in there work."
5,cadence,I love this movie. Saw it years ago and had always remembered it. Purchased it recently to share with my fiance. Now he likes it too. Well done.
2,You'd think he'd learned something,"This third solo album by Bill recovers somewhat from the disappointment of Stone Alone. Je Suis Un Rock Star is a fun track and almost worth the price of admission. The rest is barely competent disco masquerading as tuneless art rock. And Bill *still* hadn't realized that he can't sing! A fourth solo release followed this disc, but it was, thankfully, never allowed to leave the shores of Japan. Bill's Rhythm Kings discs are far superior to this or any previous disc because, 1. Bill doesn't write all the songs, and 2. Bill doesn't sing all the songs."
3,Entertaining but formulaic,"How many gay-themed fluff novels about devastatingly attractive gay men in their 30s living in New York are there on the market? This is another of that genre. Written, in fact, by four authors (two named Timothy, one named James, and one named Rebecca), it's a fine beach-read and most entertaining. I realized this early on, so was not disappointed, and will read more of their output in time. But it's purely entertainment, not ""lit-ra-chah,"" and if viewed as such, will be quite satisfying to the reader. If, however, you're looking for something more pithy, look elsewhere."
4,Good watch for the money,"This is a good watch for the money. I work outdoors in all types of weather and this watch has been rained on, put is pools full of water, and just worn like it is part of my skin and it keeps on going. I would have given it a five star review but it has one minor flaw. When it is quiet or you have a phone to your ear with your watch hand you can hear it ticking. Other than that this watch is a great value."
5,Best book yet.,I've poured through many books similar to this one but none come even close to the information provided inside. The instructions are easy to follow and very thorough. The designs are smart and the pictures quite good. If you want to make your own equipment you just can't go wrong with this book.
5,Great looking,Have only just got it and had a skip through. It seems full of lots of great ideas and plans drawings of how to. Very impressed. Would recomend it to anyone starting out in this fun.
2,It works but the sound will never be CD quality,"This product works but don't expect to get good reception everywhere. You have to play around with the stations to get a decent clear sound. Certain places will get static no matter what so I just switch to CD and then back to the ipod when I get out of that area. Overall it works. I'm waiting to get a new CD player that has an auxiliary port for my ipod. Until then, this is better than nothing.I couldn't change my star rating but I would actually give it a 4 now. I finally got the hang of the station settings so it really does its job and doesn't deserve a 2 star rating."
4,One of the best,"This movie was good because Pam was in it, it has a few good scenes in it, but overall it was pretty good. It shows a few good and steamy pam scenes in it, there are a few good riding scenes and some good sex scenes, but over all a good flick"
4,"comments from a former ""Nazareth Steel"" worker","I worked at Bethlehem Steel's Los Angeles Plant, the setting of Mr. Rodriguez's novel, in the mid-seventies. It was a searing experience that has haunted me for thirty years. No one who didn't work in it can possibly fathom what went on in American heavy industry. Rodriguez's remembered knowledge of the mill operations is remarkable, and his descriptions of the physical conditions and sensations of steelworking shot bolts up my spine. As an editor, I have some bones to pick with the story line, but not with the author's ferocious passion or narrative competency. He means what he says, and he knows what he's talking about.Michael LeckyHarvard, MA"
2,Good idea poorly executed,"I'm a complete geek and avid reader of hard sci-fi. I like Neuromancer from William Gibson, Snow Crash and Diamond Age from Neal Stephenson, and Diaspora and just about everything else from Greg Egan.But I can't recommend ""Artificial Kid"" by Bruce Sterling. The ideas behind the story are good. His descriptions are visibly good, but it reads neither like a good story, nor like a tech manual.The problem isn't isolated to this book either. ""Difference Engine"" also reads slowly. I can't even pinpoint exactly what it is, other than Bruce Sterling's writings are VERY slow to read and hard to stay focussed on the story. It's almost as if the acting is poor. Dialog, inner and outer, just seems adolescent."
5,"Probably my favorite collection of Neil's, I never tire of hearing it","He may not have written them, but he sure sings these songs as if he did with that great rich and warm voice--my favorite Neil period, the late 60s and early 70s are his voice at its best--and these songs are my favorite versions. I have this on LP, and every Neil Diamond fan should have it too, whether it be on LP, CD or MP3. This is a relaxing album."
5,Unusual,"Something different to most shows but its throughly entertaining and I enjoyed this show and would recommend it as great. Plenty of action, the river boat idea was good and the story line was fantastic, Lorenzo Lamas always plays his parts well and you can be drawn in by with the movie with the actors protraying their roles as well,its not overdone and something to watch and I will leave it to you to judge, A ferry ride,kidnapping and fights, I wont spoil anymore of the movie for you so sit down and enjoy something different with your hands full of popcorn and drink."
3,Worth Seeing for inventive Tie-up.,"Okay movie. nothing special. Effects are hokey, acting is bad (new jersey accents from canadian cops). But as for a certain scene with Lorenzo Lamas and Josie Bell hanging from a tree bagged-and-gagged (in which ropes obviously move around) Well, worth a few laughs or two."
3,... just not that good,"Ill start of by saying that this game is not bad, it's just not that good either.Pros:The graphics are AMAZINGThe characters are cool...The fighting is descent...Cons:The Load Screens! It may not sound that bad but trust me they are terrible.The story is not good regardless of what you may here. It was incredibly predictable, if you can't see the twist coming there is something wrong with you.The game boasts three alternate endings depending on the actions you choose throughout the games but actually how you play the last 5 minutes determines the ending.I like my boss battles to feel epic and when i beat them i want to feel like a accomplished something but in Jade Empire boss battles fight just like any other enemy (not much stronger either) and are very simple even the final bossThis game is short and in no way wroth the moneyThis game makes a good rent, beat it and view all the endingsin 2-3 days, but is just not good enough to buy. So much potential...:("
4,"Extremely short,but extremely great!!!!!","This was an amazing game.The combat system is awesome and the storyline in very creative.Another interesting aspectof the game was that some of the characters speak in Tho Fan,a dialect of Chinese(don't worry,it has subtitles).However,the game largely lacked in longevity and kind of disapointed me when it ended.But I've played and beaten it at least 10 times(no exagerations)and it only takes me 12 hours tops to go through it.All in all,don't hesitate!Buy this game!!!!!!It's amazing and you won't regret it!"
5,Great Book!!,Tremendous summary of moanarchial history and beautiful pictures of the monarchs. A summary of the life of these leaders could not be better. Well written and inspiring reading.
5,The Heart of Serre,"Do you know the value your heart? If you think you do, do you know yourself that well? Dive in the magical tale weaved by the firebird that reflected each one's heart desire.Serre, a mighty kingdom, with its dense and enchanted forest. Dacia, a small but wealthy kingdom, with infamous magical veined kings, except its latest one. To prevent magical war between them, Sidonie, Princess of Dacia, and Ronan, Prince of Serre, were trapped in royal marriage plan although both of them tried to flee from it. And a young wizard, tried to find and encapture his heart's true desire but attracted to dangerous side of himself that he didn't know instead. Each lost their heart and each found them again, guided by the magic of Serre in the form of firebird.Discover yourself and your heart through the tangling beauty and ugliness, light and dark, good and evil, enchanting of the heart of The Forrest of Serre, where fairytale came to life till it brought you to satisfying conclusion."
1,Two thumbs down,"One of the most ridiculous, unrealistic martial arts movie ever made.Just look attentively at Eric Robert's stance in the ring. And that idiotic cowboy hat that Chris Penn wearing and sobbing:""What are you counting them for?"" after losing the breaking match. Yeah! This is as close to reality as it can be. And the crowd at the bar rooting for the American karate team? Give me a break! Phillip Rhee and the Korean team are the only people who make any sense as far as martial arts in this movie.Best of the best? No! Worst of the worst!You want real action? Watch ISKA Strike Force K1."
2,Stick a fork in 'em.,"At this point, the Strawbs were done. This follow up to the weak Burning for You is almost as bad as it's predecessor. Other than the last two cuts, Deadly Nightshade and Words of Wisdom, there is little worthwhile about this disc. One would be better off with Hero and Heroine, Ghosts, Bursting at the Seams, Grave New World, or even Deep Cuts. Nomadness is in dire need of being reissued as it too is worth adding to the collection, but this disc was quickly relegated to cut-out bins following it's release for a good reason...Simon"
2,It dented my laptop!,"I just bought this laptop backpack so taht I could carry my powerbook along with books. I expected the laptop slot to be padded on the bottom, the most important place for padding since you put your bookbag down all the time. I always gently put the bag down...yet I still ended up getting a DENT in my brand new laptop. I've been carrying the laptop around in non-laptop bags, and haven't had any problems, so I expected no problems with a bag that was designed to carry a laptop.other than that, it's a pretty bag w/ lots of compartments, so it's great as a regular bookbag..but the laptop slot seems to do nothing."
4,Loved it,"This product is a great beginner's video for yogalates. I highly recommend it, very easy to follow and a satisfying yoga practice."
2,Simply too easy,"I bought this dvd based on the existing reviews on this site. I really wonder how real are the pple that put reviews on this site. This dvd is simply too easy. What a waste of my money. I'm going to give this to my mother who can move it onto her even older friends. Not one review even mentions that for anyone used to doing yoga, this dvd is simply a waste of time.Perhaps the intermediate or even the vinyasa would have been a better choice for me. That is why I'm reviewing this, so that I could have found such a review, before I wasted my money."

5,Dutch Kitchen cookbook,"This is just a fun book to own. If you like recipes, it obviously will fill that need. Besides the ""Cookbook"" part of it, the book shares the history of the restaurant itself, and adds a bit of local Pennsylvania history including the coal region of northeastern Pa.This book makes a great coffee table book as well."
1,Totally Overrated,Hello? The most overrated record of the year. A total disappointment in every way. Refresh your Queen collection and leave this for the clearance bins.
3,"S'not bad, I s'pose","If you went back to 1976, stole all of Pink Floyd's guitars, gave them an orchestra and punched Roger Waters in the stomach, you might get a sound comparable to this record."
5,Pushing the envelope without the obligatory paper cut,"Judging from the number of less than positive reviews on this web page, i'd say that these blokes haven't even listened to this album. Ever. Indeed, using a mix of orchestral, dreamy, and derelict arrangements and pleasing sonic twirls, this album is a pleasure to listen to, and certainly pushes the envelope using melody, dynamics, and beautiful texture."
4,Strange music; good record.,"This is a dazed, gentle and full folk/rock recording. ""Opus 40"" sounds like a psychelicized version of David Seville's The Chipmunks doing a Band tribute. ""The Funny Bird"" is Neil Young's ""Danger Bird"" with vocals by the hick Hollies. ""Endlessly"" wraps breakups in a mystical magic. A kooky, charming and great record. The only proviso is, if you don't like the high tenor, semi-falsetto, rustic choir boy vocals, it might not be for your taste."
3,a whole new thang,"From the reviews I've glanced through below, there seems to be some debate about this album. First of all Mercury Rev is not for everyone. When Yerself is Steam came out I bought it on a recommendation and I hated it. But I was travelling and it was the only CD I had so I listened to it over and over and my musical life has never been the same. So if you think that the Pumpkins are the most creative band of the '90s don't bother with this band. If you are a fan of the early stuff, though, try to remember that Mercury Rev is about no connections, even to itself. Sure they may have lost something when original singer David left, but this new Car Wash Hair shaped album has its own style. Not as risky as Yerself/Boces and more familiar to a general pop audience, it still is better and beyond almost anything out there. Listen to it in a bad mood...this album will make you very very calm."
4,Light a fire and check this flick.,"If you loved ""Three Weddings and a Funeral,"" you will love ""Notting Hill"" even more. Hugh Grant is his usual charming, ""Aw-shucks"" character, his flatmate is a bizarre, quirky comic relief fellow, and the ensemble cast provides warm, funny friendship. Julia Roberts seems to be telling her real life story through the simple love story. Watch for an uncredited cameo from Alec Baldwin. Light a fire and check this flick."
2,Pure Cheese!,"Don't forget the crackers for this cheese fest of a movie with your typical predictable story line and over-used Julia Roberts and Hugh. Why do people like the same old recycled s**t. Now an ""Ultimate Edition"" is being released. C'mon...please! Get a life! What a waste of money filming this one. This is for brains with limited bandwidth. Do your self a favor and skip this one."
2,Pretty Corny,"It's pretty much what I expected it to be: a sappy , unrealistic movie. It does have its funny moments, but most of them aren't when Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant are talking. I'd reccomend looking into another DVD to buy."
1,Nothing Hill,"This was by far one of the worst romantic comedies that I can remember, and believe me I wish I could forget it. Although the movie has two talented actors in Julia Roberts and Hugh Grant, the story if flat and uninvolving. I never forged a bond with Julia's character and thought that Hugh should have dumped her very early in the movie so he would be better off and the movie could have ended. Please avoid this movie."
4,Notting Hill,the movie is great. the picture is great. the dolby true hd is great. what did you want me to say. long live HIGH DEFINITION movies!!!
2,What is the big deal?,"I don't see what is so great about this movie - I think it's pretty dumb. Snobby actress ""falls in love"" with a bookstore owner, treats him like an unwanted dog and he still wants her back. PLEASE!"
4,PLEASANT ROMANTIC COMEDY,"HUGH GRANT IS HILARIOUS AS ALWAYS & ALL THE OTHER BRITISH ACTORS IN THIS MOVIE ARE TOO. JULIA ROBERTS IS GOOD BUT SOME HOW I WOULD HAVE SEEN SOMEBODY ELSE FOR THIS ROLE.. MAYBE LISA KUDROW OR HELEN HUNT. GOOD ENTERTAINING MOVIE & A BIG BRAVO FOR ALL THE ""SECOND"" ACTORS."
5,A moving spiritual experience for me,"This movie has now moved into the position of being the movie I have watched the most times. The more I watch it the more I see. I don't know what the writer, director and producer intended but I think the muse was at work on this one. To me the sceen where Julia is telling Hugh that she is just a girl, standing in front of a boy, asking him to love her is the soul surrendering to the beloved. All pretense is gone and only love is desired. And the love in their eyes at the end of the movie as well as the sceen on the park bench. The sufis say anything can lead us to the beloved. This film is doing a real good job of that for me."
2,Must be fun if you are a great fun of Julia Roberts,"Maybe I expected too much, but I could not help feeling disappointed. It is focused on making Julia Roberts look charming, and the not-so-bad story gets boring as it poceeds. I am sure you will love this DVD if you like Julia Roberts and her acting."
5,Notting thrill,I saw notting hill at the cinema and it was a laugh-a-minute! For those who have seen this fab flick i love the bit where Hugh Grant pretends to be a reporter and makes up things about the film 'There could have been more dinosaurs' Great.
1,I just don't get it....,"I thought it was boring and predictable -- about asentertaining as skim milk -- with absolutely no chemistry between HughGrant and Julia Roberts. The evening I watched it, I was in the mood for something mindless and entertaining. This filled the bill on the first count but not on the second."
2,"UGH - Romance, I think not","I thought I was going to love this movie, but the only redeeming thing about it is the supporting players. It stars Hugh Grant as, well, the same bumbling fool he always plays, but we love that about him. He is the owner of a small bookstore and has a quirky bunch of friends and his life if good - lacking in love, but good.Along comes Julia Roberts as a movie star and I have to say that I hated her in this. I am not a huge fan of hers to begin with, but she is awful in this. Her character is self absorbed and downright mean at times.Why did the writers make Hugh such a pansy in this film? The fact that they end up together really bothered me. She did not deserve him after the poor way she treated him. I think in the hands of another actress this might have been better. I cannot recommend this film to anybody, even those die hard Hugh fans...sorry gals."
3,"Two thumbs up for Hugh, Two big toes for Julia","Once you're done with all the hoopla about what a great couple Hugh & Julia are, you realize she really didn't have that big a part at all, which is fine with me. Hugh Grant literally carries the film with his wit and ""oh, what a fool I am"" persona. The supporting cast also shine during a hilarious dinner sequence, and throughout the film, leaving Julia to meander like a lost tourist trying to find Picadilly Circus. She's just sort of a fixture in the movie, like the loo down the hall, luv. Good writing and directing, but keep your wits about you, it isn't sensational."
1,Not Happy,Rec'd movie within a timely basis but rec'd a HDDVD. Wrote Movietronix but was told it was my fault that I should read better. What ever happened to the customer is always right?!?!? Especially if the DVD was only a few bucks they could of had a customer for life but they lost this one. I won't ever buy from them again. I bought a regular DVD from Wal-Mart instead for $7.
1,"Boring, wooden acting","When the disc froze 1/2 way through, I popped it out. Way too much hemming and hawing from Hugh Grant (who can be very funny and even act sometimes). Julia (in a true line from the movie) says 'I'm not a good actress and I'll get older and then I'll just be someone who used to be famous' ... She doesn't act, just has her wide smile fill her role."
2,The Golf Omnibus,"I was disappointed that the cover of the book pictured did not match the one that was delivered. It was a gift and I was embarrassed at the appearance of the book that arrived (totally different cover art, no picture at all. Just words in a tye dye print)."
2,The songs just aren't very impressive,They hardly rock and can't even really pull off disco. They can't touch the bands they try to emulate. The singer is weak and annoying. This band is overrated.
5,My daughter had one of these stories read at her wedding,"One of the stories in this book, The Green Ribbon, had such an impact on my daughter (when it was read to her in preschool) that she had it recited at her wedding.My daughter wore a green ribbon around her neck which the groom untied to symbolize that they weren't hiding anything from each other.The Green Ribbon is such a romantic story--until the very last line."
1,Poor Design,"This product is poorly designed. It appears to be very sturdy but soon broke. The case itself is very heavy but the cutiing wires are flimsy and quickly broke. Mow I am left with a very sturdy, inoperable tool. You should sell replacement wires!"
1,Wire snapped,Don't buy this. Wire snapped in three months light use.Looks sturdy don't be fooled.One good thing is dual slicing modes.
4,Satisfied,"Bought this for my 5 yr old daughter and use the timer function to head back home after outside playtime. There are loads of icons at the top (bikes, swim, run) that are simple animations, which my 5 yr old thought were pretty neat. As others have mentioned the straps are very big for your average elementary school girl. However, it gets tight enough where it doesn't come off."
5,Like the watch!,"Bought this watch for my 7 yr old granddaughter for her bday, November, 2012. It fits her well & now she always knows what time it is.Great buy!"
5,Deeply inspiring,This album was what I have come to expect out of the Long Beach rockers ditty bag next. It takes you back with them like your in the club singing along. A humongous improvement from Second-Hand Smoke. Good luck to the Long Beach Dub All- Stars.
1,"Intriguing device, painfully bad writing.","Yeesh, what ""A reader"" said. Was a professional editor employed in the publication of this book? Repetitive, unbelieveable physical descriptions of the characters and their actions irritated me enough to detract from the intriguing device of an Anasazi murder mystery. No-one's hair actually looks like a ""glistening black serpent"", no matter how many times you repeat it.And yeah, the story jumps around too much and introduces too many characters and situations. You'd need to keep notes to follow what is going on.....and I was irritated enough by the poor writing to lose interest in keeping it all straight.To continue damning with faint praise, this book's wannabe-Indian authors aren't too insistently ""Indian good, modern world bad"" nativist, although it's in there. I've encountered worse. Still annoying, though.If you are interested in native American/First Nations mysteries, give Tony Hillerman a try. Better written, with more believeable characters."
4,trail of stars,"come sempre i walkabouts riescono a dare quella saggezza alla musica che non guasta mai, quella dolcezza che fa lacrimare i cuori piu deboli....gran bel disco...viva i walkabouts"
4,LANCASTER MAKES A GOOD DEBUT IN FIRST-RATE FILM,"First-rate I say, but NOT a masterpiece. I just saw this film about a week ago and it has suffered from little reputation here in Europe...It`s a pity because it has a violent, contemporary air about it that makes u think it was almost made 2day, only i black and white. The performances are not the over-the-top Bogart but true in the style that - WOW - ; it`s a revelation 2 c actors perform in a natural - human - way.A real treat. As with other films on my page, A MUST-C..."
4,Each of the 34 stories is a good read for a relaxing evening,"Bertie and Jeeves know just how to take your mind off hypocritical House and Senate impeachment hearings and sexual overkill.THE WORLD OF JEEVES has brisk dialogue, well paced tales of British leisure class misdoings punctuated by the brilliant people skills of the Gentleman's Gentleman who always saves the day. Best if read aloud. I can't wait to start on another volume."
3,Excellent in decent lighting but avoid the dark places...,"The camera takes amazing photos in well lit situations. I was really shocked at the quality when shooting in daylight. Unfortunately, there is a huge contrast in quality when taking photos indoors or under dimly lit situations. The photos in low light have a high grain to them and even at the highest resolution setting with or without the flash. The quality looks a lot like a low resolution image that is big. If you're on vacation and need something easy to pop in and out of your pocket to catch a moment, the size of the camera will work great and photographing speed is excellent but as an all around camera for everything, all lighting situations, you may want to look else where."
4,Enjoyable autobiography of a passionate & entrepreneurial publisher,"Though I picked up this book to learn about the publishing business (and I did learn, just a little), I really enjoyed it as a story of how passion, perspective, perseverance, and being in the right place are important for entreprenuership.This book, written in autobiographical style, starts off with how the author, based on his university experience, has the insight that 1950s era America was ready for quality paperbacks, an insight people even who went to university before the war would have missed. It reminded me of how much of today's social networking revolution is lead by young people who have a better feel of for how people of their generation connect with each other. Most of the book is packed with similar interesting stories - from Jason's days at small publishing shops that become divisions of conglomerates to how he started three different ventures during his career."
4,Fit nicely,I used the fitting guide and a measuring tape to get the right size. I like to wear them to school clinicals. They're also great on days I sit a lot.
4,Very good,An interesting story. Very good acting and done in a very simple tone. The background and the story were well done.
5,BEAUTIFUL -- SUPERB,"Every time I watch this, I like it better. The two most outstanding features are Maggie Smith and the Umbrian setting. Just to spend my viewing time looking at that house is heavenly. And Maggie Smith is an actress you can count on to give an outstanding performance. Then just look at her clothes -- see how great an older woman can look!! Well, the entire cast was very, very good. If there is a weak point, I would say it is the storybook ending; but that won't affect your general enjoyment. This is a romatic film about wonderfully drawn characters in a beautiful setting. Love it."
5,The woman is awesome...,"Maggie Smith lovers should not be without this HBO film. Age cannot hamper nor time diminish the beauty of this woman and her work. The story conveys the richness of rising above pain by giving as much love and understanding as one can in return. Supported by a superb cast, the film encompasses mystery, humor and pathos, not to mention the beauty of the landscape. Maggie rules!"
5,Gotta Love Her!,"Lindsay Brin is amazing!! Sometimes I get sick of walking and just want to do cardio at home and she makes it easy- not easy as far as the workout goes but easy for convenience. She is a believer in interval training so I am now too. I love that she has a blog and is on Facebook. It makes her seems just like everyone else:)I LOVE that she has a 20 min yoga section. That is something I have been looking for in other DVDS because I don't want to do 30min plus of yoga before bed when I really want a good stretch- 20 mins is perfect. She gets an A+ for toning, cardio, and stretching in my book."
3,Ok but not a favorite,"I'm 18 weeks pregnant and have just begun testing pregnancy workout DVD's mainly because I am paranoid about my normal workout DVD's and any time spent laying on the back. Maybe it's because I am a regular exerciser and am particularly focused on cardio (running, elliptical etc.) but this just didn't excite me much. I would have liked the DVD better if she had really focused on the strength training exercises and skipped the cardio which I kept waiting to start and then realized that all that walking around was the cardio. Either way I bought it and will keep it but will probably hang on to it to use later in pregnancy when I'm bigger. I hope I'll enjoy it more then. For those considering this workout, if you are still relatively small bellied and doing your same pre-pregnancy cardio workouts early in the 2nd trimester you can probably hold off on this DVD for awhile. I have liked Suzanne Bowen's Long and Lean Prenatal Workout mainly because it moves so quickly."
3,Very Interesting Album,"Missy Ellott's The Cookbook is a very interesting and a very mild album with basicially missy elliott going back to the old school, although it's a whole lot better than this is a test, the album just meanders once and a while, still I Thought it was a decent and respectable look in missy's creative.A Marginal Thumbs Up for Me.3 Stars."
2,Good songs....but good album? debateable,"She has some rockin songs on here. All her singles kickass and the last song on the album with M.I.A. (i friggin love her) is fire. but then, i start listening to the other songs, ready for a song on the album that is just as good as her singles and i can't find another. All of missy's singles are crazy, but then ui listen to the album, and its like a let down. any song that she sings in makes my stomach churn and some have just annoying beats and repititious phrases. If you really liked Missy's album 'This Is Not A Test', then get this album. but if you are lovin her singles and want some more, just download the singles, don't waste your money on the rest of this album."
3,u mean the badbook not the cookbook,OMG What was missy thinkin her pass the ducth was grat so was gossip folks but this. COME ON MISSY but some songs are good mabye i didit lisn to them well. Well anywas diss-a-potined
5,I LOVE THIS CD!!!,"The song ""Joy"" is worth the cost of this album alone. Just look at these lyricsMmmmmmmhhmmmmmmSomeone's in the kitchen I don't know whoHey, hello?Who is it?BOY SCOUTS!Oh no, don't you know not to ever disturb a woman when she's cookingI have to get back to the kitchen, my cabbage is burningBesides, it's my favorite episode of Fear FactorI wonder if the ribs are done.Genius! Who couldn't come up with a better intro?Also, the song afterwards is totally sexy, along with ""Meltdown"".""Lose Control"" will be in the club forever.LAST WORD: GET YOUR HANDS ON THIS!"
4,pretty good intro....,....to the art of reading the Nordic runes. Well-organized and very easy reading with rune-by-rune explanations and pictures.
5,HIp/Hop with a Message!!!,"This album is off-da-hook. It has a formula that gets your mind thinking as well as your body shaking. This is the first Brand nubian album i have bought and it was worth it. The beats are phat and the lyrics are tight. If you have the new tribe called quest and Lauryn hill albums, this one is for you!"
5,Hilarious!,"Janet Evonovich with a dash of Grisham thrown in.One of the funniest books I've ever read! December Vaughn moves to Florida to start her own legal firm. She draws in a goofy cast of characters: Maxine, the beauty pageant secretary/best friend,Mr Ellison the crazy senior citizen with a heart of gold, the entire senior citizen brigade...the sexy local PI....then the mayhem really starts~! Cases for the seniors, the suspicous drug company suit, the idiot savant antique nut....the comedy just keeps up while the threats, mysterious lawyers, odd phone calls and dead bodies pile up! Action and laughs at 1000 miles per hour! Sure didn't get much work done today! But what a ride! Whew!Obviously I highly reccommend this book. What Fun!LM BookA"
5,Highly Recommended!,"Chip R. Bell combines the practical with the heartfelt in a top-notch guide to creating a partnership with customers. He focuses on the elements of abundance, trust, dreams, truth, balance, and grace. The book uses intelligent and creative case histories and anecdotes to illustrate these essential components and, therefore, rises above the level of the basic how-to. The author pays close attention to intangible, human relationship concerns. The book is written well in an intimate, yet highly informative style. It weaves stories throughout each chapter. Although we at getAbstract recommend this book for people who deal directly with customers and people who supervise, manage, or lead others in a service-oriented business, the author correctly points out that the book's methods also can enhance anyone's professional and personal relationships."
2,Not worth the price,"The music box was nice and it works, but the nativity looks cheap. I gave these as gifts and I was embarrassed because it looked like I bought it from the Dollar Store for $5."
3,This CD is 5 YEARS OLD!!!!!,"This CD is NOT new, kids!!! It is 5 years old, and like the others said, it is almost an illegal bootleg. This is NOT new trance, this is OLD trance. When you heard ""Oakenfold was coming out with a new album"", you actually heard wrong!! Someone put a new label on one of his old ones- one of his first albums. It is still good- But this does not reflect Oakenfold's current taste and style."
1,oakenfold is a sellout,"yeah, oakenfold is an unoriginal sellouttry going to an actual live set of infected mushroom if you wanna hear awesome psytrance"
4,This is not new material,"I've had this ""cd"" for a long time in mp3 format. Its been out in Europe for ages and its just come here. As for the music, its moderate to good, Oakey has done better stuff than this. Cheers."
2,Too GOA for my tastes,"I love Oakey's mixing style, but I can't stand his GOA albums. This is all GOA."
3,"Has some real issues be careful, looks good...but","Would I buy it again, NO. Will I return it, NO. Would I recommend it, maybe. Here's why. For smaller books the glass will cover cookbooks just fine however the book will rest at a tremendous slant and not entirely upright making it difficult to read well without being hunched over. With bigger cookbooks the glass in no way will cover the pages and you will most likely get the book dirty. If you don't mind that then it may be still for you. With magazines you may as well not use this. In addition to the smaller books resting at an awkward low slant so do the larger thicker books. The adjustments just don't tighten up enough to make it stand at a good angle. Overall its ok and well built, the brushed stainless looks good and the glass in ok. If i really want to I can add a block behind books to help prop them up more because the adjustment slide just does not do enough."
1,Alot of money for very little,"It is very small,cheap looking and the shipping charges were way to high.Wish I wouldn't have done this one."
1,Really Disappointing,"Don't buy this windchime. I gave it a 1 star rating, because it wouldn't post unless I rated it. I have searched for years for the Chinese glass windchimes of my childhood and this windchime sadly doesn't even come close. It's hard to believe the glass doesn't even sound like glass! There is no lilting, ethereal tinkling of glass, just something that sounds closer to plastic! Honestly, I can't believe how much they are charging for these hollow, pathetic semi-reproductions! They are a totally rip-off at any price. If someone tried to give me one I wouldn't take it. I was so excited to see these that I purchased 2 and one of them even came broken."
5,Great live album from Damien Rice!,"This album is everything a fan could want in a live CD! Great song choices, very emotional performance, and the songs get different takes in this live setting which makes the whole disc a treat! Definitely a five star disc if you are already a fan of Damien Rice!"
3,This Book Is Funny,"This book does have grammatical errors. In fact, I think a lot of the words were created by the author. However, this book is absolutely hilarious. If you are at all interested in learning the Italian language do not buy this book. If you are at all interested in learning how to say some of the stuff (too nasty to print here) in this book in a different language than buy this book. Have fun with it."
3,"A rough, unpolished start","Luis Mejia - The first Barry Manilow album, this was my truly first bought album by Barry apart from the compilations my dad used to have. Later on when I've heard most of his stuff I gotta say this is one hell of an uncomercial album, if you consider the fact in which Manilow puts down a recording of his grandfather telling him to 'sing it', you can notice this was not intended to be a top charting recording. Still, in between Manilow's vocal show off in ""Cloudburst"", and the majestic sound of the classic ""Could It Be Magic"", the best side of his originality can be heard, yet it's quite unconvincing on the simple ballads ""Seven More Years"" ""I Am Your Child "" and ""Friends"", and the rock showcases. Not his best material but this is the proof of Barry Manilow's talent as an original performer."
2,Pretty bad. However.....,"Let me preface this ""review"" by saying that this record is awful. I am not a fan or Mr. Manilow, and I find him extremely boring and unimaginative. However, as I gave this record 2 stars, there must be some redeeming factor going on here, eh?Absolutely. Although the songs he takes writing credit for on this release are without exception fairly terrible (painful, even) Manilow's rendition of ""Cloudburst"" on side A (a tune he did not write) is beautiful. There's really not enough I can say about this song. Witty, silly lyrics, brilliantly interesting arrangement, and Manilow's vocals actually work well within the song.For the love of god, please do not buy this CD. It's still horrible. However, if you happen to come across the LP at the Salvation Army for a buck or two pick it up, if only for ""Cloudburst""."
3,"My son likes ""waiting for Santa' better","This tape is cute but my son and I find it a little 'draggy'. There's not as much singing and dancing to keep his attention. He doesn't sit to watch the whole tape as he does for lots of other Barney tapes. My 19 month old son seems to like 'waiting for santa' much better. He watches the entire show and I can get things done around the house too that way. ""waiting for Santa seems to have more singing and dancing that he enjoys to keep his attention."
2,Poor choice for a cheap telephoto,"I was a little naive in the purchasing of this lens. I went around and asked a lot of different sources on getting a relatively inexpensive telephoto lens beyond 300mm. They all said the same thing- there is no such thing, if you go cheap you are wasting your money.They were right. I was extremely disappointed in this lens. If you think you're going to freehand this without a tripod, there is no possible way to do it. If you set it up against something stationary, it's still going to cause a snowy white image. You have to use your tripod or the shot is wasted.The quality of the photos would rate approximate 6/10. They generally appear a little darker with quite a bit of grain.It's nice and compact in design but if you care about the quality in photos, stay far away from this lens."
2,Works great... for a while,"This was perhaps the neatest device I have ever purchased. The concept was elegant, simple and worked extremely well. Until it STOPPED working after about a year. I called their tech support and found out that there were no replaceable parts and there was no method for repairing it."
3,CITY OF LIES,"It's fun to resurrect these old novels. The story CITY OF ILLUSIONS is misnamed; it should have been CITY OF LIES. The Shing aliens are the best liars ever and have the ability to mindlie telepathically to take control of earthlings minds. They meet their match, however in Falk-Ramarren, the split brained super hero who the story is all about. The females in the story are all pawns as are most of the other characters. However if the travails of one earthling's struggles to regain his lost mind is your cup of tea then this story is very engrossing."
5,Don't Think Twice,"First book I've ever read that I could not guess what was going to happen next. Written from the viewpoint of a Native American fighting to keep from losing the most important things in his life-his marriage and his land. A lone man fighting greedy businessmen and his own people, who view him as a traitor, to save his resort and his marriage. Not knowing if he can even trust his best friend, he sets on a path to save what he loves most and risks it all in doing so. I loved it, my mother loved it and by brother is reading it now. I was fortunate enough to have met the author's wife in a small book store and was able to get the book autographed. She also told me it was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize. Here's hoping the book gets the attention it so greatly deserves. Anxiously awaiting the sequel due out in June, ""Six Crooked Highways."""
1,Disappointing,"I guess I missed something here. I never felt like I understood the story; it was like I'd dropped in the middle of it and little idea of what was happening. I had no feelings towards any of the characters, and didn't find any of them likable or even compelling. Also, I didn't like the frequency of the use of sentence fragments. On the plus side, I did like the vivid descriptions of the northwoods. I really wanted to like this book, but I just didn't."
4,Once you know the secret...,"Firstly, this product shipped and was delivered in the exact time and in the exact specifications advertised, EXCEPT 1..On the box it says ""plug and play"", however, it does NOT mention that the plug is back between the headliner and the roof of the truck, to the passenger side a few inches. To access it, I had to reach up under the headliner from inside the truck, which involved pulling the headliner down slightly and (finally) getting it unclipped. I was then able to pull the connector free from the retaining clip and feed it through the hole where the stock light wiring went. After that, plug and play was the truth. I've read on a few F150 sites that most folks ended up breaking the retaining clips to get access to the connector, however if that doesn't sit right with you, then plan on taking part of your headliner down. Other than that issue, this item is great, couldn't be happier..."
5,Excellent and well organized,Some of my LGBT friends gave me this book when they heard I would like to learn about their history and the civil rights movement we all work in. I enjoyed it cover to cover and would recomend it without hesitation to other heterosexuals who wanted to get an introduction about the importance of LGBT history without feeling like they were reading a textbook.
3,Dissappointed,"Don't be fooled by the caption on the DVD box - ""special wide screen edition ""because it's full screen.An excellent Shaw Brothers early 70 movie,still has alot of action and is still very entertaining.However I feel conned because it's not wide screen as stated.This dvd must be the worst ever transfer from vhs.Eventhough it's a great movie,please wait for a better copy."
4,Great movie,"This is a good movie about jealousy,ambition,revenge and an ingenious weapon of destruction. Good acting as well. A must have for any Kung fu flick fan!"
4,Product Review,"In general, we are please with the product, a 2 Deck Rotating-Revolving Card Tray. Compeditors models are slightly sturdier and not so easy to tip over. But for the price, a good choice."
3,Canasta tray,Cards need to be placed carefully into the tray or they hang up. That kind of defeats the purpose and slows down the game.
2,Like it except,"....for the revolving part! It seemed like such a good idea, but in reality it has too much movement and it is not all the level. We used the empty card boxes on either side to keep it stable. It would be nice if I could take the bottom off entirely, but I haven't tried for fear I'd just mess it up worse."
3,unsteady,"good quality. the concept is great, however the tray bounces all over due to the design of a round swivel under the rectangular piece (which is too lightweight to maintain a level position). i have a plain tray (no swivel) for 1 deck, that i put the felt chair glide pieces on and it works better than this one (my opinion)."
1,It arrived broken,"Even though it was in its own box and the box was in excellent shape it was cracked and a piece broken when it arrived.I've returned it with no problem, but still don't have a tray holder"
5,2 deck rotating card tray,"It won't improve your luck, but it works like a charm.This product is great for Canasta and other card games."
2,Decent for average home games,"These are suitable for average home use, I guess. They're light, they're slippery, and nowhere near casino quality. No, they're not as light as the super cheap plastic ones, but they're about 3g off of casino weight.Also, when I'm at a table I usually shuffle my chips constantly, which you cannot do with these due to the fact that they're plastic and slippery. I mean, you CAN shuffle them, but not very easily or very well.Anyway, if you're looking for a run of the mill, plastic poker chip for occasional home games, sure.. why not.. but if you play poker with any level of seriousness, your friends are going to make fun of you for using these. And, for the price, go buy one of the clay composite sets."
2,"One Masterpiece, more than one yawner","We loved Sand Kings, a couple of other stories were okay and most were too boring to finish. My son and I thought this book would be a nice collection of interesting stories - but overall we were disappointed. If this is the best, I should have been a writer."
3,Falling short of other works but still redeaming,"This record, which finds David Grubbs by an Avant supergroup of sorts,falls short of my expectations. The songs seemed more tangable and flushed out when I saw them performed live by Mr. Grubbs. Not my favorite record by far partially due to a lack luster recording/production job which doesn't seem to fit with the style of the music."
4,Great dance music!,"I often listen to this CD set when I need to motivate myself to do housework or to get dressed and out the door. The CDs are also great for aerobic dance. I own ""Afterdark: London"" as well and am hard put to say which set I prefer."
2,New york gone dark,"These cd's are just OK. I was expecting more of a faster pace house beat, that I did not get from these cd's. If your into slower pace house, then this one's for you."
3,"12 volts from ""the wall""","This adapter plugs into the wall and turns out 12volts just like your in-car plugs. It is effective and looks reliable (I haven't had it long enough to rate lifetime). It does get pretty hot, so you need to be careful not to let the cords sit on top of the adapter while in use"
2,"Gets very hot, smells horrible!","This product certainly works to cool my Kooltron P95, but it gets extrememly hot to the point that I am afraid to leave it plugged in unattended. It emits a terrible odor, and I plan to return it."
5,did the job,this product did the job.. i got it for the mini coke machine and it works perfectly.. couldnt be happier
1,headache headache,i bought this but i got a headache on this vitamins and stomach pain it's a waste of money .........
1,Horse Pills,"These pills are HUGE and incredibly dry!!! Are you kidding me? I'm supposed to swallow these while I'm nauseous?!? Fat chance! Although I have to admit, when I cut the pill into 3 pieces and choked each piece down with a ton of OJ, I didn't experience any weird side effects. So if you don't have a problem swallowing really big, chalky pills, the vitamins and minerals in these pills seem to balance nicely with your digestive system."
5,Easy on the stomach!,"I like the nutrients derived from food-based sources and only the need to take the vitamin only once a day, which is easier and more manageable for me to follow and not having to keep track. I also like another more expensive brand like New Chapter perfect prenatal, which is also food-based, however I would have to take 3 pills a day to get the daily dose, which I often missed with a busy schedule. So for more reasonable and affordable price, convenience, and comparable nutrients, I prefer and have been using Rainbow Light just once prenatal for the last two years."
3,vita,"At first I was very disapointed because the first vitamins I ordered never showed up at my door even though it said ""delivered"". Amazon was quick to replace and send me another package asap. Overall these are great vitamins!"
4,Dont know much about the multivitamin tabs,"I guess they are cheaper than most of the good brand multi vitamins out there. I bought them as they had good reviews, and there were no side-effects for my wife."
2,Horrible Constipation,"These vitamins gave me horrible constipation. I like the fact that you have to take only one, but I can't get past the stomach pains. I'm going to try something else.Rainbow Light Just Once Prenatal One Multivitamin, 150 tablets"
2,surely it can taste better than this ...,"My insurance does not cover prenatal vitamins, so on the hunt for something I could afford I purchased these. I liked that they were natural, included ginger extract, and were one a day.But surely they can make a vitamin that tastes better than this? I've tried a range of other vitamins, and never have I had anything that tastes this bad. I don't understand the folks who said this doesn't taste bad - did they get different pills? Are their taste buds dead? Even the smell in opening the bottle is overwhelming. My current method is trying to cover the pungent taste (and aftertaste) with milk. Doesn't quite work, but anything to take the edge off.I do take them with the Mommy's Bliss Omega-3 DHA supplements, and those are quite nice."
5,very good vitamin,"These are great. You take one a day with a meal, instead of 3 or so. They will make you sick if you take them on an empty stomach - which is normal for a vitamin. I brought them to my Doctor and she said I picked a good vitamin :)"
5,LIke these,I have been taking these for a few weeks now and so far like them... Don't upset my stomach like some other brands do either
5,Favorite Vitamin,This has been my favorite daily vitamin for the past 9 years. My blood results show the vitamins are absorbed by my body and they are so incredibly gentle on my stomach.
5,Gentle on stomach!,Great vitamins for anyone! Love that they are gentle on my stomach and they live up to their word about helping with prenatal digestive issues!
3,Still looking for a good tasting Prenatal vitamin!,I bought these prenatal vitamins because another reviewer mentioned the mild flavor but for me....it wasn't mild enough. But it definitely doesn't have the strong taste like other prenatal vitamins. For me....I'll keep searching!
4,Multi-Vitamin,"Overall the product is worth it the cost. The only thing I have not received from the vitamin is the energy boost some of the other buyers have mentioned. The vitamin is easy to take, gentle on the stomach."
5,I love it,"I couldn't be happier when I received my two bottle of prenatal one yesterday. The point is I just placed this order two days before, and the suggested delivery date is around 5 days later.I started to eat one with meal. It looks light green and smells herb mixture. One amazing thing is I chew it before swallowing it. I believe I never worry about size problem.it contains something to help my digestion that is my favorite."
2,Concerns with this vitamin,"I've been taking this for 2 years while my hubby and I tried to conceive. I didn't have any problems in all that time. It is a HUGE, non-coated pill, but I didn't have too much trouble swallowing it.Then I got pregnant.At about 5 weeks, it became impossible to swallow without gagging and forcing it down my throat. I almost vomited trying to swallow the darn thing. It's just too big!!I only just learned that in 2008, the FDA identified this vitamin as being number 5 in the list of prenatal vitamins containing the most lead! You can read more about it by doing a search for ""prenatal vitamins lead"" and then clicking on the link to the FDA's site.Definitely scary stuff!"
2,nausea!!,"I started taking these because I am low on Vitamin D and they have added D2 so I thought it would eliminate having to take that pill too. I am currently trying to conceive and started getting heavy nausea in the afternoons after I would take it (I had to eat something first because my stomach tends to be sensitive when empty). I thought ""Yeah! I'm pregnant, I have nausea!"" But no. Turns out it was a side effect of the vitamins because it would happen almost every day about an hour after consumption. Boo. So now I am back to the drawing board for something that doesn't upset my stomach. Although Rainbow Light does make my nails grow! As with any prenatal, however."
4,Great Prenatal Vitamin,Rainbow Light is a great prenatal vitamin. It does not upset your stomach either! The best part is that it is all natural unlike most prenatal vitamins. The only downfall is the price.
5,awesome prenatal vitamins,I originally started taking the Women's Just 1 multivitamins until I became pregnant. These pills are big but they are not hard to swallow. They don't really have a bad after taste and it goes down pretty easily. I love that it's only once a day and you are good to go. It does make your urine darker so remember to drink plenty of water with it.
3,BORN TO DEFENCE(IF YOU COULD SEE WHAT'S GOING ON),"JET LI GIVES A PRETTY GOOD PERFORMANCE IN THIS DARKLY FILMED MOVIE, YET I HAVE NOT SEEN ONE MOVIE THAT UTILIZES THE ABILITIES OF PAULO TOCHA. I HAVE SEEN HIS TAI FIGHTING MATCHES AND, HE IS REALLY DARN GOOD... IT'S ALWAYS THAT WAY. RENT BEFORE YOU BUY IT THOUGH. THE BOXER FROM EUROPE IS GIGANTIC AND FIERCE, WITH A KILLER CROSS. LIKE I SAID RENT IT FIRST."
1,Film quality prevented the movie from reaching potential,"In post-WWII China returning Chinese soldiers are met by overbearing American G.I.'s. One of the local soldiers (Jet Li) runs into trouble with an American captain. Fans of Jet Li's 'Once Upon a Time in China'and 'Fong Sai Yuk' series should be aware that this movie contains no ""wire fu"". Fights between Li and Kurt Roland Pettersson (European Boxing Champion) and Paulo H.P. Tocha (kick boxing Champion), which would have been entertaining are unfortunately marred by poor lighting and become hard to follow. I would have liked to see Li's wushu pitted against conventional boxing and kick boxing but the scenes are so dark that the images become blurs. New fans of Jet Li's recent movies and the fight scenes in 'The Matrix' should try the above 2 series as well as 'Shaolin Temple'and Donnie Yan's 'Iron Monkey'."
2,not what i expected,"i'm normally a big bad boy fan, but this was just horrible. I have all Biggie's albums and Puffy's stuff, but this compilation just made me less of a fan, and I don't think I'll be buying Bad Boy anymore. The samples from Puff Daddy just **** me off, he ends up ruining all the cool artists like Mase, and The Lox by bringing them into his company and slapping old beats over their otherwise good rhymes. At least he didn't get DMX, I think i'm a Ruff Riders fan now. don't waste cash on this thing, and i'd recommend no more bad boy stuff at all."
1,I didn't know Simple Plan changed their name.,"Ya, when I first heard this, I thought it was SIMPLE PLAN. I mean come on! They are just a SP clone. Simple Plan, who also suck, have obviously changed their name.HEDLEY is one of those ""Wah-wah nobody understands me I just wanna cry all day"" bands. I HATE IT! That is not how emo music should be. Face it, THESE GUYS ARE NOT PUNK. their pop. In my world, It's illegal to call these guys punk. So whatever.Want good music? Listen to COHEED AND CAMBRIA."
5,DVD movie: BLOWN AWAY,"The DVD movie: Blown Away, starring Jeff Bridges & Tommy Lee Jones arrived @ my shipping address in good condition. The DVD movie is in great shape."
3,It was ok,"The movie was not as what people reviewed it to be. The scenes were stuff gets blown up is cool but there is not many scenes like that, it had to much dialouge. It did have a few gripping moments but other then that, it was an averge movie with nothing memorable."
4,Somewhat slow but entertaining nevertheless...,"I very much enjoyed this film which I consider more of a drama/thriller than a pure action romp. Tommy Lee Jones is very hammy as a sadistic Irish bomber who likes to get things done loudly and violently. Jeff Bridges' Irish accent is terrible but I really enjoyed his character. I consider this one of the few action movies I've seen where I actually care about what happens to the characters and sympathize with their weaknesses. I also appreciate the fact that the movie gives the viewer time to breathe in-between exploding set pieces, (which are all well done). Something isn't going ""Boom!"" every ten minutes and the violence isn't that bad for an ""R"" rated movie. Largely an ignored piece of work which is too bad. It deserved better."
4,Explosions galore!,"I thought this movie was super when I was a teenager, and I still think it's super. Who wouldn't want to watch a movie about terrorism and U2?!"
2,pretty but order one size larger,These are perfect little slippers. The impratical outer fur minimizes cankles and makes your foot look much smaller. Everything about them is nice but they did not feel true to size so they are being returned. A previous pair of Acorn's women's slippers were too big. These are too small.
4,Colorful and adorable!,"Yes, I could have bought a plain old plastic recorder for my 2 year old son to play with, but once I saw these adorable and brightly colored instruments, I had just had to have one! I also ordered another and gave it to my friend, who has a son five months older than mine. Music is such an important part of childhood development and this darling recorder is the perfect way to celebrate that notion! One drawback, however is if you have a young child, who likes to throw things, this recorder may chip a little, since it's wooden and not plastic. It's nothing serious- just a little chip off some of the paint. When I see my son pick this up and blow into it like the ""pied piper"" to make a ""melody"", I crack up!!! Also, lots of speech therapists use items such as these to exercise muscles in the mouth that are imperative for talking..."
3,NOT A LITERARY MASTERPIECE BUT ENTERTAINING,"Although the literary quality of this one leaves something to be desired, I found the story to be amusing because it was so ridiculous and absurd. I couldn't help but laugh, and that's all I'll say about the plot. The characters, with the possible exception of Geraldine, are underdeveloped and stereotypical, or perhaps I felt that way because I only read one of the shorter prequels. For an adult novel, it seems rather juvenille and silly, but I can't say I'm sorry I read it."
5,Hot!,"These girls aren't like the ""Runaway"" girls. But they make some shocking decisions. As soon as you read the book, you feel the chill it contains. I thought the senario was going to be predictable. Kind of like in the first four V.C. Andrews series. But when Geroldine suddenly died, I knew this book would take a wirl of exicitment. The characters are unrealistic, and I am surprised they even got along. But they pulled through the hard times.When Cat and her friends buried Geri, it showed how naive they were to try and cover up the truth. I guess hat's what it took, to keep Cat from living with foster parents. They were all very naive, but halarious! You will question the audacity, these girls have! They have some major nerve."
3,its an ending,"This book was similar to the true vc andrews style but still not as good. The orphans and wildflowers are not as page turning and intriguing as past series have been. I was very disappointed in the ending of this book. There was no real closure to the story as if it was being left open to possibly continue. If you have already started the series it has to be read though because it answers alot of questions about Cat, and very few about any of the other girls."
1,HORRIBLE!,"I think only about 3 chapters in the book were worth reading. The story started out ok, but then it was just page after page of irrelevant nonsense! There was too much going on--half the book could've been edited out without losing the story. I was never able to get a hold of where this book was going. I could see how the writer ATTEMPTED to have readers feel sympathy for the characters...but it just didn't happen.The storyline was ridiculous & towards the last few chapters, I found myself RUSHING through the sentences just to get the book over with!FINALLY, when the ending came, it confirmed my thoughts that this book was a waste of my time."
4,A Guilty Pleasure,"OK, I admit it -- I've been reading V.C. Andrews books since I was 13, and I always do have to read ""the new one."" Like many other readers, I was disappointed in the Orphans miniseries. It felt as if someone had figured out that teenage girls are drawn to her books, and decided to make them ""tamer"" because of it.The Wildflowers series started off the same way, but slowly built to being more like the books I remember being glued to in the library after school, the books I read in order to reflect, ""Well, my life might suck, but at least nothing like THIS has happened to me.""Into the Garden is that kind of book. The strange coincidences, twisted family relationships, and buried secrets coming unveiled for the not-quite-adult protagonist are classic V.C. Andrews, and about time. Why does the ghostwriter think we READ these things, anyway? :) Jade's strange form of New Age magic makes a nice addition to the classic formula."
3,What's happened?,"I believe the last series that was true to Andrews' spirit was Dawn. With Ruby it started going downhill, Melody was trash, and now these miniseries! How odd that the Wildflowers books were matched to children's books and juvenile literature on amazon.com. I want the real novels back! Hopefully the next book...."
5,Forget The Long Pain After A Breakup,"Extreme Breakup Recovery is a book that will give you the tools to start healing immediately after a breakup. Castelli, really nails down the feelings and emotional rollercoaster after a breakup. There a many exercises that will help you see yourself and learn many lessons that you need in order to move on. The author is honest, direct and has expertise in recovery and healing. Great book for someone who wants to move on fast."
5,Smart and powerful,Imagine a breakup as a learning experience that can enrich us and bring us to a new level. And imagine a method that can help us use the breakup for our benefit. This is one of the main ideas of this book. It is empowering to learn to deal with a breakup in a way that can propel us into change and learning in an accelerated fashion.
5,A GOOD COLLECTION OF SONGS FRO HER FILMS...,"LIKE JANE RUSSELL AND DIANA ""SWINGING"" DORS, MARILIYN MONROE DOESN'T SING AS GOOD AS SHE LOOKS, BUT IT'S AN UNFAIR COPMARISON. MONROE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO INTRODUCE GOOD SONGS AND REPRISE JAZZ STANDARDS IN HER FILMS. SOME GOOD SONGS HERE ARE ""a FINE ROMANCE"" & ""MY HEART BELONGS TO DADDY,"" SHE MIGHT EVEN SURPRISE YOU BY SINGING GOOD..."
1,JUNK,"The analog time stopped working after 1 month. Then the center adjusting knob came off, I put it back on and the then it fell off again. Finally after swimming the junk leaked water and was ruined. I will NEVER buy a Timex again. I bought a Casio now and it works great and for half the price as well."
2,Oe is disappointing on his musing about religion,"A Personal Matter continues to be a favorite of this avid reader. Oedecided to try something new and it just doesn't work. In exploringvalues, beliefs he almost drills in some pretty boring characters. Inever put down a book partly read but this one was tempting.Gad, a grind...Oe's strength is his play on words, come back master!"
3,A good Eurodance Album (not the best),"La Bouche fans may be disappointed after discovering hit sensations like ""Sweet Dreams"" and ""Be my lover"" from their previous album. This new CD delivers Melanie Thornton's powerful vocals but not the same catchy melody in most of their songs. The 2 pick tracks are ""You won't forget me"" and ""SOS"" in my opinion. I'd opt to buy the singles and skip the album unless you're a hardcore La Bouche fan."
1,A fragile phone...for lady use,This phone is like made of a piece of glass. I dropped it by accident on the floor and LCD started cracking. TMobile charged $75 for the repair/exchange. I haven't seen such a phone that is so fragile. This is definitely not a phone recommended for day-to-day use.
2,not a very good phone,"when i first got this phone i was very excited. but then the phone started to act up. sometimes when i am talking it would just cut me off. the reception is not really good. the ring tones are too soft and the vibration feature is really soft. i often miss my calls. the free camera phone is just a con to get you to get the phone. the camera does not have a good resolution. so all in all dont get this phone, it will be a big disappointment."
1,"Worse Than ""Soup Cans & String""","My favorite thing about this phone is the ability to use ""In Da Club"" as my ring tone. Unfortunately, that's all I like.For the first 3 weeks, it's fine...Then everything falls apart. The screen turns off, the antenna falls off, it switches to analog mode for no reason, the battery dies faster than most non-viagra users and the WORST thing is its refusal to charge. This piece of junk is so temperamental, you have to plug it in 12-17 times in order to get it to charge. Then 1-3 times a week, it will wait until you fall asleep, THEN stop charging - leaving you with a useless paperweight for your long day at work. And forget about replacing it, I've had 7 in the past year and they ALL fall apart. Plus, your wireless provider will pull some crap about ""warranty periods"" and ""upgrade charges"" even though your *most recent* phone is only a month old. Stay Away...far, far away."
2,"one good song, two not good","""Maps"" - interesting video. Very interesting song. Has a feel that reminds me of Joy Division/early New Order. The singer sounds just like Siouxsie of Siouxsie and the Banshees. Much promise here, but the absence of a bass to support climaxes and high points is noticable. Great guitar playing and drumming, though.The other two songs are awful. They are completely different stylistically speaking from ""Maps"" . The sound to me like bad Joan Jett songs made worse by the sparce instrumentation. Lyrically, they're uninteresting, uninspired and un-original. It's been done before, folks...Too bad. ""Maps"" has great promise, but the other two tracks fail miserably. I was going to buy the full album, but after hearing this ep, I'll stick with the one song I like."
1,EXTREMELY MISLEADING,"The title of this kindle edition says that this book contains both the final volume of In Search of Lost Time, and the Guide to Proust. The Guide to Proust is nowhere to be found, rendering both the kindle edition of the sixth volume AND the kindle edition of all six volumes together COMPLETELY USELESS. I felt completely misled when I saw that the Guide (which is part of the product's title!!!!!!) was nowhere to be found in the kindle edition and returned my copy immediately. Stick to your hard copy. Thanks for nothing, Amazon. Considering returning my kindle since this was half the reason I bought it!!!!"
5,"Vanitas, vanitatis!!","Mr. Veblen is a refined person in the use of the words he uses to address and explain the economic habits of the refined people of the upper-class of the beginning of the last century. He spares no expenses in detailing in a very polite manner the idiossincracies of the noble and very rich when deciding what to buy, what to use and how to behave, going also to all lenghts explainning how these habits mold and form the habits of the not so rich and noble strata of the society. His theory of the leisure class reachs significance when compared to the rationality which some economists, classics and neo-classics, ascribe to the human being as an economic agent. I was quite surprised by the elegant style of Mr.Veblen and the fine irony (which he does not admit) with which he treats the rich and noble of his time. Sure, this is a book which could be also serve well times ahead and before Veblen's time."
4,"My child is captivated each time he listens to ""Peter""",My two year old son loves to listen to this CD and asks for it over and over again. The music and the story told by Jack Lemon keep his attention.
4,Two great artists at their peaks,"I love Ms. Fleming's creamy, almost over-ripe soprano, this program however is not the perfect vehicle for it. On the other hand, Mr. Thibaudet, with his elegant and percise approach is right at home. I do admire Ms. Fleming's adventurous choice of material here as in the past her choices have been quite safe and standard issue. I hope she continues to grow as an artist and does not fall prey to all the hype around her."
3,got the defected ones,"The whole first set I got were not working properly, but I got the replacement. The replacement works well. Amazon replacement process is impressive. I got the replacement in the next evening.PS. Almost all My friends who have this set have the same problem, mostly comes from the defected charger, some from bad batteries. They all got the replacements which work well by now."
3,Low Current,"The Idea is great, i used these batteries on the V2 lithium flash light , and they worked fine, but when i bought the Fenix P1D Cree edition , they couldn't produced enough juice to produce 135 lumen on the flash light, conventional A123 (non rechargeable )can give you that due to there hight current output."
4,"A great compliation, but read the new biography","We're accustomed to compilations such as this falling short, but this one actually does give you a sense of the depth and breadth of Wayne Shorter's career. Columbia made a sincere effort toward complete representation of his musical journey and scored a real licensing coup with ""Aja""--though it's probably just a sign of how beloved Wayne is among musicians that even Steely Dan gave up its closely guarded material for him. I wonder if this compliation's connection to the new biography has anything to do with its success. Like a previous reviewer, I'd recommend checking it out: The Life and Work of Wayne Shorter, by Michelle Mercer. Mercer gets way inside Wayne S's far out imagination and explains how his music is the product of an original and questing mind. The book is highly entertaining and moving."
3,A good nose is not required.,An unbelievable but interesting story. Good cinematography. Full of many ugly and a few beautiful characters one of which is at first I did not recognize as Dustin Hoffman.
3,Original-Disturbing-Hypnotic,"Enjoyed this film except found it so disturbing that I knocked off 2 stars because I'm uncomfortable being disturbed; still, perhaps that was the point. Loved the scene at the end when he's on his way to face the crowd -- really interesting insight about the powerful sense of smell."
4,The Scent of the Movie Lingers,"This is one of those movies that, until the last 20 minutes or so, I really liked. Then my dislike of that last 20 minutes or so ruined the preceding 2+ hours. I think it's because I can't reconcile the pure love and joy felt by those exposed to the perfume with the evil that went into making it. If I had been insanity, I could have accepted it, but the movie closed that loophole. Yet I keep thinking about the movie, turning it over and over in my mind so there must be something there."
1,Not What I expected,"I love a good mystery. This was dark, violent and not a mystery. The dreary,damp, dark setting made it an uncomfortable and uninteresting experience. But then again that's my opinion based on what I like. I imagine there is an audience for just such a period piece."
1,Weird,The acting was good but the story was too weird and not terribly interesting. I didn't find it plausible that a scent would cause people to bow down to its creator.
1,Terrible,"OMG two hours I've forever lost. Should have read the reviews first, won't make that mistake again. SLOW, SLOW AND SLOW, which then turns into slower aggravation."
1,Gads Zooks!,"I hated the movie. It was just too freaky. The baby was oh so sweet and I wanted to hold the poor, little unwanted thing. But that was the only part of the movie that moved me. The rest of it was so ridiculous, that I was ashamed that I rented it or even spent the time watching it. I like period films but this was just inane. My opinion, of course. If you want to waste a couple hours of your life like I did and regret it, go ahead and spend the money. But take my advice and pass on this one. It is just tooooo stupid."
2,Okay movie,I was expecting this movie to be different than most & I was right! It was pretty slow moving but not a bad movie if you are looking to kill some time.
4,Different but good,"This movie is very different, but it was good. Anything we can make it through to the end has to be good. Will watch many times, and recommend to friends."
5,Stunning!,"I was a little wary about buying this anime but I'm so glad I bought it. I won't go into detail about the plot- especially since other reviewers have done such a great job but I wanted to state that individuals who aren't sure that they should buy this anime- you should! This anime has one of the most amazing visuals/graphics I have ever seen. I was stunned when I first started watching it- the graphics in this anime are so hard to describe- some are reflective, some translucent and some even seem to move (especially on the clothing). I have never seen anything like it and I own a lot of anime. The story is good- maybe a little slow at times but still good and the music is amazing. I'm only sorry that I waited so long to buy this series."
4,Nice!!,"Really a good story with original animation boarder lining art ""the lazy kind like Picasso but it gives it a good feel"" likeable characters the story was just the right length not too long not too short though I thought the ending lacked something to be desired in the large scale of anime endings it was a suitable end. I really enjoyed this and look forward to watching it again."
3,Koolatron Compact Kooler,Koolatron Compact KoolerI ordered a new Koolatron Compact Kooler but received a factory rebuilt instead. Amazon adjusted the price but the cooler would not work. I attempted to contact Koolatron via telephone and email without success. I finally repaired the cooler myself and it now works fine. The warranty is worthless!
2,Poor quality and materials from 1970th,"Very soft plastics on the cooling unit which is so fragile you do not want to touch it with any food/beverage inside. The outside plastic wall is made of very thin PVC which bends under your hand when you try to slide the coller in the trunk. When pushed, the wall bends and touches the fins of the fan stopping it. There is no switch for the cool/warm modes! You would have to change the polarity on the plug! - Really cheaply made. I would describe it as if someone in canada making it in his/her own garage using retired plastic meting tools:)It does cool OK though which means the cooling element is working as expected but I would not buy this cooler again.Hope this review will help to improve the quality of this unit."
5,"quick delivery, effective product","the cooler was delivered in just a few days. it fits perfectly between the seats of my minivan and behind the passenger seat of my sedan. it's a bit noisy to operate in the house, but the noise is completely drowned out at highway speeds in a car. it is a good size and keeps things cool for quite a while even when the car is turned off."
4,"As described, but it isn't 100%","I expected the case to be a bit wider in the compartments than it was as I had hoped it would accommodate the bullets primer down. But with my intended rounds (7.62x54r) they must be stored point down and there is some slop in the compartments as a result.It's better than the bag it replaced, but still not 100%."
4,Great workout but short,"I loved the workout in this DVD although it was short. The workout is tough & you're legs, abs and back will be in pain during and post workout. My legs were shaky throughout the workout and I had to take regular breaks doing the abs workout. The excercises in this DVD are great in that they teach you proper form and introduce some new workouts to your routine, so even when you don't have the time to exercise, you can still manage to do some of these workouts on your own."
3,Can't go wrong with that one!,"Venezuelan music has different roots and rhythms. This one has a definite Venezuelan touch, with a more rapid rhythm than music from the plain, I should say a more costal beat than other Venezuelan traditional music. It is very dynamic but never hypnotic. Good singing, good humor and happy mood, different from the deeper nostalgic music from the plains (musica llanera). Although having no vested interest in that CD manufacturer, I would say that regardless of the price it is worth getting if you like South American music. Now when you start looking at the price, you realize the bargain this CD is."
5,"DRE' AND BIG BOI ARE THE DIRTY SOUTH AT IT'S BEST, 'FO SHO!!","AIN'T NOBODY AND I MEAN NOBODY PUTTING IT DOWN ARTISTICALLY LIKE OUTKAST. FROM ""ROSA PARKS"" TO ""THE ART OF STORYTELLING"" THESE BOYS ARE STRAIGHT 'TRILL DOG. IF YOU WANT HEAR WHAT TRUE TALENT SOUNDS LIKE COP THIS C.D. THE DUNGEON FAMILY DID IT AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN!!! ONE LUV FROM COLLEGE PARK!! P.S. TELL THE GOODIE MOB TO HURRY UP WITH THEIRS. IT'S TIME FOR THEM TO BUST SOME HEADS TO0 PART'NA!!!!!"
3,OUTKAST IS OUT!!!!!,"OUTKAST DOESN'T GET FIVE IN MY MIND. THEIR NEW CD IS WEAK, AND LACKS OF GOOD LYRICS. THIS SHOULDN'T BE COMPARED TO OTHER CLASSICS!!!!!!!!!"
5,"Original, Innovative, Extraordinary",Oukast have set a standard in hip hop music that will be hard to eclipse. Their music has constantly grown and continues to prove that there is artistry in hip hop. This album will be hard to top. The best group and the best album in hip hop.... period!!!!!!
5,"Excellent, vibrant musical style!!!!","This CD is an excellent addition to anyones hip-hop collection. Varying from fast-paced lyrical slashing verbal rhymes to slow r and b based songs, to Southern tempoed beats, this CD just does not cease to amaze. You can't beat the Combo of Andre and Big Boi. Their contrasting styles are just right in complimenting each other on this album. You can see how much growth they have made since their first album."
5,Chillin Like A Villan,"""Aquemini"" is probably the closest that OutKast is ever going to come to the mainstream rap scene (as we've seen with Stankonia). OutKast does a fine job with ""Aquemini"" and is probably thier most popular album to date. Although, not my favorite of their four albums, it still easily deserves five stars. ""Aquemini"" features top-notch production, a sound performance lyrically by both rappers, and some creativeness. Cuts such as ""Da Art of Stroytellin' Parts 1 and 2"", ""Return of the G"" and the electrified ""Chonkyfire"" show OutKast in great form. Raekwon and George Clinton perform up to par on their featured tracks. And heaven forbid we forget to mention ""Rosa Parks"". I still hear people singing that song to this day. Aquemini is a great album. I can listen from songs two to ten without a pause. I recommend picking it up. (Altough,I'd recommend trying Southernplayalistic adillacmuzik and ATLiens first)"
5,HANDS DOWN A CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I JUST HAVE THREE THINGS TO SAY. LIBERATION, SPOTTIEDOPALISCIOUS, AND SYNTHESIZER. IVE BEEN AN OUTKAST FAN SINCE SOUTHERNPLAYALISTICADDILACMUSIK AND THEY NEAVER CEASE TO AMAZE ME. THE ENTIRE AQUEMINI ALBUM WAS A HIT. I WOULD ADVISE ANYONE WHO DOESNT HAVE THE ALBUM DO TWO THINGS. ONE, SLAP YOURSELF FOR WAITING THIS LONG TOO GET ON THE TRAIN. TWO BUY IT AND BURN A BACKUP AND PUT THE ORIGINAL IN A SAFE PLACE BECAUSE YOU WILL WEAR IT OUT. TRUST ME IM SPEAKING FROM EXPERIENCE.4 Big Dawg DPS my brother is an aquarius and his daughter a gemini so he has aquemini on his forearm hes a fan also"
4,"Aquemini , first aid for a culture in need","Aqemini , Outkasts latest is one of those rare albums you can listen to over and over again . Here you have an album with original yet catchy beats and 2 MC's which flow and writing skills are among the best. There isn't really a song you want to skip on this album. In the beginning you will enjoy them hits like Rosa Parks, but as you progress your attention will be for the other tracks to . This album is the one you should pick up when your last believe in hiphop is fading away , I hope many artist will follow the example of Dre and Big Boi not by imitating but by just being as original as them."
3,Ho Hum,Book is ho hum. Short little discussions on a few but various selected Torah topics. Nothing really in depth. If you have little Torah background and want to have a taste of short mostly ancient and medieval rabbinic commentary then buy it. Better yet try and find a library copy first.
4,Hospital Bed in a bag,"I gave this bed in a bag 4 star as the top sheet is trimmed in green and the bottom trimmed in blue. The sheets are truly wonderful though. Very soft against the skin, and wash beautifully.I would have liked the blanket to be a little longer as I can only tuck in the bottom edges. The blanket is made of cotton and feels a little rough. My spouse doesn't seem to mind as the blanket is light weight for summer.I would love to buy additional identical sheets from this company but they do not offer them"
1,Never Takes Off,"After listening to a few recordings of the opera, this recording is at the bottom of the heap. Rudel's limp tempi and an apathetic chorus help weigh down the drama. I don't remember if Sills made this recording before singing the role on stage, the performance here reminded me of what I heard live. She's way over her head in the role and there's nothing she can do to make the adjustment in darkness or heft needed to put it across. Plishka and Burrows sound like they are sight reading. Verrett is the only soloist who gets under the skin of the character with her usual bravura approach and gorgeous voice."
1,DO NOT BOTHER,"This is a free title, so it's not as if you're wasting money here, only time. Presented here are a handful of edited stories, a mere sampling of the complete whole, which, admittedly, is near-impossible to find. Instead of downloading and reading this digital sadness, find a more complete edition and enjoy that. The One Thousand and One Nights are worth reading, but you need to read a version that actually includes Scheherezhade at least, also The Three Princes, and The Prince and the Fairy, and many, many more. This has none of them. Find a good version, do not waste your time here."
5,Terrific stories for road travel with young kids,"I bought this for my two sons, ages 7 & 9. We put it in at the beginning of a 2.5 hour trip and it kept our entire family very entertained. The trip flew by."
2,Not what I'd call low-carb,"These recipies do sound delicious, but they aren't what I'd consider low-carb. Carb counts are as high as 35 grams of carbohydrate per serving and ingredients include sugar, all-purpose flour and cake flour."
3,Weekend trips to the store Cooler,I use my cooler to hold my cold items when I go to the store. Wish the lock was made a little better but works okay. After having a larger Colman for 9 years takes a little getting use to on the smaller size. Bought a smaller car needed a smaller cooler.
4,cooler,this kooltron cooler works great took a one month vacation with it and it kept all are drinks water fresh fruit and sandwiches that the wife made for the trip cool. and when we stayed in hotels just used the ac adapter which i also purchased from amazon and it also works well. i am a dieabetic and the cooler kept my insulin at the proper temperature even when we traveled thru arizona and the grand canyon would recoomened the kooltron cooler it's the bomb!
2,Judy Misses With This One,"Not one of her best; over-orchestrated (especially the Jungle Jam bridge befor the last verse in ""Pretty Polly""); songs too similar; too few songs for the money. (Sorry, Judy--I've loved just about everything you've ever done!)"
3,NO!!!,"As much as I loved Judy Collins' work in the 60s, especially as she displays in her 2 CD Anthology called ""Forever"" with Both Sides Now, Hard Lovin' Loser, The City of New Orleans, this album really turned me off. It is just not her thing, man. She does a creditable job on ""Wind beneath my Wings"" and ""Amazing Grace"" but the rest of the album is not up to her standards.Sorry babe, that's about it."
2,The Mantis Fist Style,"Well, this movie is original on many levels.And I have to give it credit for the most unusual ending I have ever seen in a Kung Fu movie.But I still found this movie to be dissappointing overall.The scene with the kid were disturbing.I can't explain it properly, but a 12 year old should not be bathing naked with his uncle and a strange man. It was a quick scene but it was still disturbing.The end fight scene is the only reason I give this film two stars. And the end fight scene is definitely above average."
1,In my opinion Not That Great,Movie uses splice and cutting to make actors seem like they are doing moves they are not.Terrible kung fu is displayed.Watch it once to see what a bad kung fi movie is.I would have given it 0 stars ecpect the lead actor (Beardy) is a good actor.
3,Has This Release Been Remastered?,"Someone please confirm this Anniversay edition has been digitally remastered. As of the most recent version I purchased, ""Rock Hudson/Doris Day Romance Collection"" the print was still grainy and in need of work. This is a delightful film by two of Hollywood's biggest stars and deserves to ""Sparkle and Shine."" My rating is based on the video quality, not the film itself!"
1,ugh,"I will probably never see another movie with Doris Day in it. No offense, but the acting was stilted or overdone. Rock wasnt much better. I am a total old movie fan, but not of these actors!"
3,Colors faded,"This DVD looks as if it was transferred from a poor quality source. The colors are faded and there are some scratches and dirt. It's shameful. Universal should have done a restoration before releasing it, but apparently they are not concerned with quality. I will definitely think twice before buying another Universal DVD unless I've actually seen it running. Having said all of that, the film is a delight and this is probably the best quality version we're going to see for a long while."
1,ripoff,"subscribed through magazines.com, for one year, after six months no delivery. when i complained to magazines.com, StS offer 1 (!) issue extension and no credit for undelivered issues. Neither StS nor magazines would give refund"
5,He Was A Kid!,"This CD comes highly recommended as one of the most original of all time.Even if you hate it, give Esham a lot of credit for inventing a genre and being so original at such a young age. That has alwways been hard to come by.This album has a plethera of outstanding tracks, a few that hold up very well, even today.""For All The Suicidlists""; ""Word After Word,"" and others."
5,The good old days!!!,Finally!!! I have been waiting years for this re-release. This is the pinnacle of late 80s thrash metal (but I wasnt about to pay those outrageous e-bay prices). I saw these guys open for Testament and was blown away. Too bad they never got the recognition they deserved.
3,The Aggression Scale,"This turned out to be a fairly good movie. It requires your full attention in order to follow the movie. The review descriptions given for the movie are not as accurate as the movie, however it was a good movie."
5,LOVE,My favorite author of all time!!! Can't wait to curl up and read this book with some cocoa and a good blanket.
5,great service,Under the Lilacs was important to me because it replaced a favorite book from long ago. The one received is in great condition and must have been new! It was received in excelent condition and after only a few days from ordering.
4,A reader..........................,I was asked to read this book over the summer of 2000 and it was great. This is the first book I have read by Louisa May Alcott. I really enjoyed this book and it was sometimes boring but great. I would recommend this book to some that has lost touch with life.................
1,Can you say rip off??,"After listening to the entire album once, I immediately placed it on my pile of cds waiting to be resold. Why?? Well, I just couldn't tell if that guy yelling was Anders Friden or Tomas Lindberg, and then found myself thinking how musically similar this band is to those two. If the album wasn't from 97, I might have credited Soilwork with more originality, but with bands like In Flames and ATG, who needs them??"
5,Love this show!,I love this show! My only complaint is that I wish the show had longer seasons! I own all of the show and can't wait for the new season to come out!
5,lovin burn notice,My wife and I absolutely loved Burn Notice Season 4. We sdtarted watching burn notice 123 when it came to a local channell in Boise Idaho. She was a little down that there was no season 4 so I bought it for her and we both loved this season and we are looking forward to season 5 as soon as it comes out.
3,Burn Notice: Season Four,"The episodes were great, however one of the DVDs was defective. I have found this to be the case on other multi-DVD packs I have purchased from Amazon.com. There doesn't seem to be any quality control regarding the physical DVD"
4,The Life and Times of a Genius,"The accomplishments of Jeremiah Horrocks, as depicted in this book, are truly astounding. The author carefully reconstructs Horrocks' genealogy, his brief life and his ground-breaking work in astronomy, amidst the backdrop of seventeenth century England. The book is well-written, clear and engaging. Less appealing to me was that the book contains many passages reproduced in the original old English. This slowed me down a bit since I found them cumbersome due to the different spelling and sentence structure characteristic of the period. On the other hand, this may be inevitable, at least to some degree, because of the book's subject matter. Overall, this is an interesting read that would likely be particularly appealing to astronomers at all levels."
4,Good book to answer the question is this Ph.D. just a technical degree?,"As stated in its introduction, this book was motivated by the concerns (perhaps fears is a more apt description) of a doctoral student who felt that she would not have an opportunity to learn about the ""philosophy of science."" Neither in her coursework nor in informal interactions with her professors.Although I now believe that this common concern/fear is really more aworry than a reality (and is best addressed by the demarcation problem/boundary work [e.g., science and religion studies as found in Oxford Professor John Hendley Brooke's books/papers]), the inability of many intelligent professors (especially the younger ones) to adequately address it when asked has marred the experience of students in more than a few major doctoral degree-granting research programs."
4,Synaesthesia: An ultimate collectors edition,"'The Collection' is a 2 CD album release that has 19 songs altogether of some well known and some not so well known songs of Synaesthesia from all their previously released albums. This double pack CD is well worth the purchase by novices to this type and style of music. At the forefront of Synaesthesia is Rhys Fulber and Crhis Peterson, the former well known for his great work on FLA and Delerium and Peterson known for his work on Equinox and Noise Unit. The different styles are blended here in this compilation listing like no other and comes out great and stylish.For fans of Delerium, Intermix, Pro-tech and FLA, Peterson and Fulber will provide you with alot of similar sounds be it dark ambient or high-tech industrial. The collection is worth getting and I have enjoyed it. It would have been good if Synaesthesia also included a mix between known and songs unknown on this collection."
3,"I didn't know he could ""sing"".","I only know of Jack Lemmon the actor - you know, Odd Couple, Grumpy Old Men, Glenngarry Glen Ross, etc. I came across this album and gave it a listen. It's almost comical - to hear him singing is just funny. It's hard for me to take him seriously as a singer. But, he is decent at it. The songs are all swing-y low-key nice stuff. It's just hard not to crack a smile to hear him sing. I keep expecting him to break out in a rant a-la Felix from Odd Couple or his character from Glenngarry.This album was made in 1990. But he has a couple other albums circa '59 and '63 as well. I wonder how those are."
5,Great product! Quick shipment!,This was a great product! Quick shipment! Perfect fit for a 2003 Kx 125 big bore kit. Came with everything needed.
4,Easy weekend reading.,"I read the book in two days, and it was an easy and entertaining reading. This is my third book by Eloisa James and I really enjoy that there is more than one story line in the book. If you read the previous two, you will get to see your favorite characters from the previous books. However, I also like the fact that the book is written so you can read it as a stand-alone as well.It is a little hard to belive that a ""straight as arrow"" lady as Helene Godwin is, would change that much and become all passionate and sexual. It really does not happen overnight, but it is a romance novel after all. We all are looking for something nice and exciting in books and Eloisa James delivers.Overall, without giving away the mail story line or lines, it is an easy and enjoyable read."
1,Do not waste your time reading this,"Eloisa - what were you thinking???? The hero was so revolting, but I kept reading thinking that something was going to be revealed that explained that it was all a pretense and that he had some positive qualities.....hmmm no such luck! He bumbled through having sex, accidentally discovering a ""nipple"" and surprised that touching it could produce pleasure ..... pleeeaaaseeeee! This book was so bad, that I think it will be a long time before I even consider, let alone read another Eloisa James. Pity, I had enjoyed some of her other books."
1,Your Wicked Ways,"I don't feel that Helene's was being justified on this book. On previous books, she was supposed to be a strong and confident woman that was very good of ignoring her husband's wickedness.Then on this book, she suddenly changed from strong and confident person into a weakling, just easily submitted to her husband's selfish demands. Even after the fact that she was ditched for his mistress.No, I was very disappointed on this book. I wasted my time of reading it"
3,Not too bad a flick for Doris and Rock,"This movie was okay. Not as great as Doris Day's and Rock Hudson's first pairing, but still entertaining. A must see, though, for their fans."
4,Doris and Rock's Final Big Screen Adventure,"Doris Day and Rock Hudson were the quintessential romantic team of the late fifties. They made three romance classics together. Tony Randall often was one or both's best friend.In this film the two are married but his hypochondria threatens their marriage. Tony is the next door neighbor. The story is simple, they breakup but eventually find out they cannot live without each other.Of their three films, this is definitely the weakest but if you are a fan of either Doris or Rock, then this is needed to complete their set.There are some very funny scenes but not up to the quality of their first two.DVD EXTRAS: None"
2,"Cats love them, but....","My cats all love these, but they're constantly falling apart. (The fish, not the cats.:) I've mended them so many times that there's no more fabric left to mend! I suggest buying the bananas or cigars instead. Those hold up much better!"
2,Darin Deserves Better,"I grew up with Darin watching him on Bandstand in the fifties and as he developed into quite a wonderful ""crooner,"" an adult singer. I have loved his ""That's All"" album through the years, through thick and thin.I'm glad Spacey brought this man more recognition. But Spacey was way too old for the film; Darin died at 37. Kate Bosworth as Sandra Dee is not in Spacey's league as an actor and it was painful to watch her on the screen. It brushed off his early rock and roll years which had great stuff like Artificial Flowers and Clementine (already showing Darin's turning to jazz and more ""pop"" tunes, like Sinatra).The story was scattered all over the place. But Spacey's singing was terrific, if not exactly like Darin's. (Sissy Spacek really nailed Loretta Lynn in Coal Miner's Daughter.)This picture was a ""what might have been"" rather than a good biopic.Yes, Bobby deserved much better than this. But I give Spacey an e for effort."
4,good musical,"This film is like viewing a Broadway musical on film. Spacey does a great job with the role and his singing is wonderful. Not up to par with the real Darren, but certainly great for the role depicting him."
1,godawful!,"This movie is so godawful on every possible level my boyfriend and I had to undergo exorcisms in order to ever watch a Kevin Spacey movie again without having random godawful scenes from it seep, unbidden, into our conscious state. Unfortunately, it has forever altered the way we see him, like discovering something creepy and embarrassing about someone you always thought was so cool. Bobby Darin must be whirling where he's planted."
2,Bobby Darin's Silent Movie,"Kevin Spacey's movie is interesting, but I say - he's a cheater. The story is all about the pop singer, Bobby Darin, but you never get to hear Darin sing a single note of music. It's Bobby's story, but Kevin does ALL the singing himself. So you gotta listen to Kevin's second-rate voice - King Kevin"" the narrator rules. And I find that Kevin Spacey is a second-rate, one-note actor (overrated) in the movies of his I've seen. So go ahead and watch stupid Spacey's shameful sham."
3,A Creditable Bio-pic,"I have to admit, I enjoyed Beyond the Sea, but it did not bowl me over like some of the folks here. I give Spacey high marks because it is obvious that this is a real labor of love for him. Not only does he do well with the musical numbers, but he seems to be loving every second of them. In fact, Spacey can sometimes bother me, but here I really appreciated his work. The only drawback was that he did look too old throughout.Bosworth did absolutely nothing for me as Sandra Dee. In fact, I had to remind myself on ocassion who she was playing because I never ever felt it - she just seemed so flat.Overall its definitely worth viewing. Especially for those of us who may know the great music but never knew much about the man."
2,Mack is not Back,Bobby Darin was my favorite singer when I was growing up in the 50's and 60's. Kevin Spacey never fully captures Darin's brashness (he should have given the role to somebody much younger). The script was second rate as was a lot of the acting. I was very disappointed with the film.
5,Absolutely not to be missed!,"Kevin Spacey is sensational, of course. Find this movie while it is still in theatres and see it."
1,Ms. Ridley,After reading an article by Yvonne Ridley in Muslims Weekly I decided to warn you of her anti-American position.
5,"the ""girl"" from Brooklyn in a signature role!","There are roles that instantly make me think of a specific singer--Price's Aida, Callas as Norma--and here's another with Sills as Elizabeth. It's interesting to listen to Sills being interviewed where she talks about the last 20 minutes of this opera as being her most demanding and difficult time on the stage. She talked about how she chose to sacrifice purity of tone in certain sections in favor of dramatic intensity. She said that with several hours of makeup before going onstage in a costume that weighed over 50 pounds, that she would leave the theatre exhausted. Here you see why...she IS Elizabeth, and when you listen to the scene where she reminds Essex that certainly he does not want to incur the wrath of the daughter of Henry VIII ---well, it doesn't get much better than this!"
1,"WATCH OUT, ALL ""SHOCKHOUND"" RECORDS ARE MP3 DIGITAL ALBUMS, NOT ANALOG",EVERY SHOCKHOUND LP IS AN MP3 DIGITAL LP.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY. LOOK FOR THE ORIGINAL ANALOG EDITIONS.
5,A Chorus of Angels,"I've heard people say this was Bjork's most bizarre album, but i see nothing bizarre about an outpour of genuine emotion conveyed through the various voices of her contemporaries. This has become my favorite album from Bjork due to its innovation and its honesty. Listening to this album is like drifting through the chasms of your deepest thoughts, a discovery of a soul that might not even exist were it not for the myriad voices pounding through your head."
4,3D experience,"Not an easy album at all. So far, I own all of Bjork's CDs and Vespertine is my favourite. I liked it from the first time.Medulla, instead, needs much more reflection. I am not sure I will like it in the end.What I strogly advise is, if you consider buying it, absolutely get the SACD (or DVD audio) version. Of course you must have a decent surround system.The layers of Bjork's voice come from the different corners, and dialogue with each other and with the sounds and noises in the space. The 3D experience is really unique and cannot compare to the flat CD."
3,Hasn't Finished Growing On Me Yet,"All of Bjork's albums have had to grow on me and Medulla is no exception. There are a couple of songs on the album that I loved instantly, Pleasure Is All Mine and Oceania (saw her perform that at the Olympics opening ceremony and LOVED it). Medulla was the first CD I've purchased in almost 2 years and I think it was well worth the wait. The songs are pretty weird but if you're already a fan I would definitely recommend this album."
1,Bjork is a Self-Indulgent Hack,"This is one of the worst albums I have ever heard. It's boring, difficult to listen to, and represents the anti-asthetic. This is simply a half-assed attempt by an arrogant artist to create a ""revolutionary"" album. It's not revlotuionary, it's just annoying."
4,not for everyone,"i have been a bjork horde for some time and to hear her open up a box of tunes based on pure voice is refreshing. She has stripped away all the noise that can drown her out and focused on the base of music and art. Her voice. She has opened up a world that is completely against the norm and is letting us touch upon something that most artists are probably afraid of...I know that she isn't the easiest artist to love at first, but it takes great patience and new ears. Keep in mind that this is not for everyone, but for those who dare to try, open your ears and breathe."
3,Bjork's reputation precedes her,"After a thorough exposition of her genius as song-writer and performer, what can Bjork do but become more focused, more esoteric, further removed... Unfortunately, with Medulla, she has strayed far from the ecstatic brilliance of past works.There are exceptions, most notably the song Oceania, track 9 on Medulla, which are proof that Bjork's genius is still with us, it has in fact even grown.But for the average song on this CD, it is experimentation that is a hit or miss.... and unfortunately mostly a miss; in fact a total derailment into inanity, into slight boredom detailed with obscure intricacies, shrieking one piercing wails too many to the casual ear, to a human ear listening for the beauty I have come to expect from this brilliant artist."
1,"If I could give this zero stars, I would!","This is the first time I have felt compelled to leave a review of an album. The absolute worst excuse for an album that I have heard. I am usually quite open-minded, and all for an artist who explores different approaches to their talent, but this CD defies all reason. Not only do I not like a single track on it, I could not even play it as background noise without feeling like I was about to go insane. The tracks are annoying and weird, pure and simple. And that's all I'm going to say. Listen at your own risk, but I highly recommend saving your money this time around. Hopefully Bjork will get back on track after this apparent mid-life crisis passes....."
3,Undecided?,"How can Bjork fans be so stupid? To love such a confusing artist and not know what ""Ancestors"" is about. How can they say it's a joke trivial song. It's a song about evolution! I'm not even a full-on Bjork fan, this album is my only first taste of Bjork. I'll soon get the rest.Some uneducated listeners here."
4,The Outer Limits,"Though this album will never be harolded as Bjork's best, it represents the limit of her more experiemental direction. An album with no instruments! Vocalists from Mike Patton to Rahzel make guest appearances to add to the mix of on album that isn't concerned with being ""radio friendly"". It may not be as compelling as Vespertine, but it's definately better than your typical cookie-cutter pop album."
5,This is not top 20,"I love Bjork. I always have and I think I always will. It doesn't take me long to fall in love with each new work she produces and I anxiously wait for new releases. This is the first time I did not instantly love a Bjork album. I think that's o.k. because I did not instantly hate it either. You learn to appreciate this album the more you listen to it. If you are exhausted by the processed top 20 crap the executive geniuses have decided we need to listen to and love, then try this out. It's refreshingly different and raw sounding. I love it more everyday!"
1,"after all, she remains a pop artist...","Bjork last LP, Medulla, has been presented by someone as it was a contemporary classical music work. Well, if we have to judge Medulla from a classical point of view it should be rated less than zero. Bjork is not stupid, and clearly knows she is doing (high quality) pop music... maybe sometimes she forgets it. Let a boys' choir listen to Stockhausen and ask them to imitate his style: probably you'll get something like Anchestors.""Experimental"" doesn't mean ""clever""."
1,painful to listen to,"I loved every Björk release up until this one, Vespertine most of all. It seemed she had taken her considerable talent and refined it and done something very magical with it.And then came this. A love-it-or-hate-it album, and I hate it, sad to say. It's as if she cast aside all her skills and talents beyond her voice, and didn't give her voice the right environment in which to shine.I'm all for experimentation, but in my ears, this one failed. I sincerely hope her next release returns to former glory."
5,"A Piece of art, gentlemen!","I'm not a very fan of this artist, but i must to say that ""Medúlla"" is a great record with very good sounds and songs...she's back with a lot of alternative sounds and rhythms...whatever, congratulations for this amazing cd!.."
1,"Poorly mastered, amateur mix","Only die hard fans of Prado or folks with no appreciation for a good sounding CD will dig this album. Each track has a different volume and quality level ranging from transistor radio to hifi. BUT, if you want to hear him at his best but can do without Cherry Blossom Pink, check out the CD 'PREZ' The Mambo King, Vol. 1 [Original recording remastered]. It's fantastico and sounds so good it's hard to believe it was recorded in '57. You will feel as if you are driving the strip in Miami in an old convertible."
3,Unnecessary,My hamster would rather use the bathroom everywhere but in his bathroom area. I even tried moving it to where he normally goes but he just goes on the other side lol.
2,"Starts good, couldn't keep up","I am starting spanish from ground zero. I knew how to count to ten, but that was all.I was very pleased as I worked my way through the 1st CD -- I really felt like I was learning. Feeling pretty stoked, I went on to the 2nd disc. Whoa! I was totally lost. The 1st disk is called the ""on-ramp"" before the lessons on discs 2 - 4.It really seemed to me that discs 2 - 4 might have been the concept for the package and somebody said, ""this is too hard, let's add an introductory disk"". The english-speaking narrator and the spanish speakers are different from from disk 1 to disk 2 as well, lending support to my theory. The main problem (after disk 1) is that they just start speaking spanish with very little repeating and I haven't a clue what they are saying.I haven't even listened to disks 3 & 4. I'm going to try another program."
3,FALSE ADVERTISING - Full price is less from Pacific Coast!,"I like Pacific Coast products, but this price is a joke. The full price for a king size down blanket from www.pacificcoast.com is $139.99, NOT 210 or even 149.99."
1,blanket,"It is a lot thinner than I expected and feathers are flying around everytime you toss and turn, it irriates my eyes making them puffy in the morning."
2,"Good, but no comparison to the original cast","Although this reveals alot more of the grit within the story, I found it to be a little harsh, and not very romantic. Although Sally Bowles was no great singer, Natasha Richardson is close to awful. Mary Louise Wilson, however, is just wonderful."
4,1998 Revival Refreshing,"Cabaret is a sample of Broadway at its finest. I Love this cast. It's just as good if not better than the original, which is a rarity in Revivals. The role of the emcee is a role that could not be more fitting for Alan Cumming. Natasha Richardson fills the role of Sally Bowles with flare, though no one can do it like Liza Minelli. The band is wonderful as well. Alan Cumming will blow you away with his heart wrenching rendition of ""I Don't Care Much"". Natasha Richardson will pull at your heart's strings with ""Maybe This Time"". ..."
5,Book buy,Great book. clearly breaks down and covers every aspect of world war two. covers topics thoroughly. Great book for anyone interested in WWII.
1,There will never be another Rob Halford,"Ripper Owens JUGULATOR Sucked. It was so generic and sloppy, nothing like Judas Priest. Consider the fact that I own 27 albums, 12 tapestries and I have retired 30+ JP tshirts, I WAS one of their biggest fan. He might be good live but he will never ever EVER be Rob Halford... NEVER. Can't sing, can't harmonize and CANNOT write like Halford. Sorry but their time is over with out Halford. Priest is dead, face it."
3,Priest detuning its guitars!!!!,"No matter how good or bad Ripper Owens is, the fact is that the new Glenn Tipton's Judas Priest with the new logo and with detuning guitars and lyrics reaching an all-time low does not even comes close to their glory days!!!!LIVE MELTDOWN suffers from this new found ""aggresiveness"" from the band, detuning its guitars and screaming with w rough voice all the way long.I rate it 3 stars only due to the songs selection here. Seldom a live album had such a well-chosen set list like this one! Very good!"
1,Terrible,"I bought this cd not realizing ""Ripper"" Owens was on lead vocals- bad mistake. All you have to do is listen to the sample of Victim Of Changes provided here on Amazon. Of course Tipton and Downing sound great, but just wait until the vocals kick in. It's absolutely awful. He sounds like the stereotypical wannabe heavy metal singer from a cheeseball cover band you'd see at the local rock club in the 80's. Do yourself a favor- save your money on this one and pick up an earlier Priest cd with Halford- Unleashed In The East is the best Live one- I'm buying the latest compilation box- only 4 songs from Crapper Owens."
5,best game in the world,"having never played h3 but more than a couple times, i believe this is the best game in the world.and if it isn't, its only second to halo three!"
5,"Strange Unecessary changes, but still the BEST YET!","If you're a Halo fan, then you will eat Halo 2 for breakfast.With smarter A.I. that have personalities (like getting revenge on you if you shoot them, and very smart/fiting taunts if you miss), a more expansive amount of maps, terrain features, and of course VEHICLES(!!!), Halo 2 is the next step in XBox's domination of the First-Person-Shooter/Multiplayer market.The story line will keep you captive until the end, then it will cut off your hands and slap you with them. It is a GREAT story, in-depth, well thought out, and it draws you into it and engulfs you almost like a good book, but the ending is somewhat.....lacking."
2,Just your average FPS,"Halo 2 definately falls short of all the hype it recieved. The graphics are great, but I've seen better. The sound was great, but with such short and not all that fun campaign mode with a weak story those things really don't matter. I had it beat on hard after playing it for a weekend. The ending is terrible and there is no real gameplay innovation that seperates it from Halo. Essentally it is Halo with new guns and vechicles. Also, a new playable covenant character is thrown in there but I hate the covenant. They are trying to whipe out the human race after all. My advice is rent before you buy, I'm glad I did."
5,Awesome game,"Both my husband and I have played Halo2 and thoroughly enjoyed it!We used it on our Xbox 360, and it ran without any modifications!The graphics, fights, and every other aspect of the game are evenbetter than Halo. Buy and enjoy!"
2,Endless,"After drowning in hype, I finally gave in and played Halo 2. If you are a Halo fanatic then you will of course like this game. However, if you are like me and were sceptical that it can be as good as all the hype, you will probably find the game repetitive and a bit frustrating. I did enjoy some of the game's new features such as your personal energy shield that helped you stay alive longer, and the frequent save points that kept me from having to re-play levels for endless hours was also great. Unfortunately, the various levels were often repetitive, the story line is not well defined and the ending is one of the worst I have ever seen (but I guess we can all look forward to Halo 3). If you are looking for a single player first person adventure game I would not recommend Halo 2. If you love the look and feel of Halo and want to go online to destroy your friends and enemies, then Halo 2 is the game for you."
3,Great Game But...,"Halo 2 is a great game! It's not as good as the first one but a good sequal. I was disapointed in the visulals, they were poor. I still liked this game. It could of been better."
5,Halo2 is great,It has alot of action it is a great game for playing system link it's really fun if you use four systems Knaa im sayin. The story is original the cut scens have Holley Wood perfectionit it's better then bacon.
1,Boring!,"Do not get this game! It is almost as stupid as the first. All you do is walk around for like an hour and then eventually you kill a few aliens. So, do not get this game, it will bore you to tears."
1,HALO SUCKS,THE HALO SERIES IS THE MOST OVERRATED GAME FRANCHISE EVER!!!! I HAVE NEVER PLAYED A MORE FRUSTRATING GAME! (EXEPT HALF-LIFE 2) HALO SUCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,halo 2 guns???,"This game will not go down as the best game in history probadly most over ratedIts the same as the first one!!! (microsoft must be laughing as the money rolls in)it dose deserver more than one star but not much. I really did try to enjoy it but sadly it was sooo badUr team mates sayings r sooo lame i wanted to kill them to shut them up. The game is the same all the way through. A big battle. Then u run around in pitch black tunnels. This game is way to dark it hurt my eyes and that is just bad. Its to hard to see whats goin on in 4 player and 1 player they put to much effort on graphics and u can't see anything.The last straw was when a team mate ran up t me and said ""follow me"" the he ran to an entrance to yet another dark tunnel and stood there????? that is just bad. Come on i played 100 bucks for this and it was trash :(BUY THE FIRST ONE MUCH BETTER WORTH 3 stars."
4,Great game but not quite there,This game is AMAZING but a few things wrong with it:there are less then 10 levelsthe ending is terribleparts dont make sensebesides that it is great but dont buy until it costs less then 50 cause i beat it on heroic in less than 2 days
5,Better than the original,"If you've ever played Halo, then playing Halo 2 is a must!!Pros..dual wield weapons, great gameplay, great graphicscons..too addictive, missing too much school, and work!!!"
3,"ya, but NOT","WOHOOOOthis games first half (missions 1-5) was SWEETBUT H2 has MAJOR FLAWSman sometime when i die, it is SO chunky it looks like MCs sut is made of nylon.the graphiics are so good, they look cheesy.its really fun, btu h1 was betterohand the endingSUKSBIG TMIE"
2,"Ahahah, didnt live up to the hype, did it?","Now that it has come out and the hype is over... I think that we can all say that this game was nothing compared to what people thought it would be like. I think we all learned a valuable lesson about this, x-box sucks and it has the worst exclusive game titles"
2,Graphics may be better - But this is a major setback.,"Everything that was great about the first Masterpiece of HALO is DESTROYED in this game, it has lost all of its creativity and should have never been released. It has hard hard controls, basically redicouslously dark places, and its just highly over rated. DO NOT GET IT, this game sucks!. The only things good about it are - Being the Covenant, and having better graphics."
4,Repetative?,"I liked the original Halo... in fact I loved the original Halo.The problem with Halo 2 is that they tried too hard. They developed the multiplayer, which is very well done, a little too well and left out the campaing. I am one of those gamers that plays mainly for the storyline as opposed to pure 24/7 combat and I will say I was disappointed with the campaing. I was expecting more Earth-combat than just the first three or so missions and less Halo combat (Delta Halo... yes, another damn Halo), the last 10-12 missions.The first Halo revolved more around the story than Halo 2, as I just mentioned. Bungie/Microsoft was a little too obsessed with the Live multiplayer action.Overall, if you like killing all the time, buy it. If you read the books and are looking for a great continuation for the story, just watch someone play it and don't buy it yourself just to say 'Hey, I got Halo 2!'."
2,"Too short, does not live up to the original's greatness.","I just completed the game after somewhere between 8-10 hours of total gameplay over the course of two days. I feel cheated out of 50 dollars. I haven't yet tried the multiplayer aspect of this game (nor Xbox live) but the story mode was not worth it. I recommend this as a weekend rental... The missions are nowhere as interesting or dynamic as they were in the first game. As another review mentioned, much of the levels are ""corridor-style"", involving fighting in tight quarters which gets old fast. I kept playing expecting something better, but the only thing that came was the credits and the end of the game. Though I haven't played on it, I think this may be an attempt to push Live, because the story mode seems premature."
4,Get over it.,"This is over all a very good game. It give you more options with weapons, more vehicles and more immersion than the first Halo. There are some out there that say that this is just more of the original Halo, well high speed, that is kinda the whole point to make a sequel of a game. You can't have a game that follows in the footsteps of another game w/o having something the same. This game has more storyline and goes further into what the covenant are about than the first Halo. The vehicles, weapons and characters have all been tweaked to give more detail and functionality. The levels are diverse and small touches like destructable objects add to the immersion, such as blowing apart a little wall that a grunt is hiding behind. Yes, there are some issues with cutscenes having visual glitches and yet I still can get the impact of the storyline through them. Overall, this game is just plain great and well worth it for anyone to play."
5,The King Of All Xbox Games,This game is da bomb. It made me late 4 school a couple of times. The graphics is amazing. I wuz kinda disappointed about da ending.
5,aaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwsssssssssssssssssoooomm,"Well i dont have the game but my friend does and while i was playing multy player i noticed the vision. you really couldnt see that good, but the good side of the game was that the weapon feature where you can hold two weapons was awsome. OK OK I ADMIT IT ive never played halo 1 and me playing halo 2 was my first, but i got in the groove right away the controlls were easy the guns were cool the vehiciles were awsome! A moms out there get this game for your children even if they have never played the origanal halo because it is awsome"
2,Mediocre 1st Person Shooter,The Legendary level is way much harder than Halo 1. The game is also boring I quit playing after a couple hours.
1,Worst Game EVER,"This is by far the worst game ever. I will only beat it 5 more times ... Tonight. It is short, so short i beat it in an hour and a half. I have 3 preordered copies: 1 for my game collection, 1 to play, and 1 to set on fire. If i knew that this was such a heaping pile of [crap], I would have only bought two. (...)"
1,This Is Stupid,"I hate blood. This is the worst game I played in my gaming career. Those who thinks Master Chief is unbeatenable, YOU ARE ALL WRONG IDIOTS. MetalSonic can rip him up (by copying all of his powers and abilities. He has that ability.) into shreads. That simple. He copies the power and the ability they can do, mix it into the power of chaos and KABOOM. Your done. Not even Kirby can kill him. I'm going to rip this game into shreads."
5,Even Better Online,"This much anticipated XBox title is a blast to play in single player mode. When you add in on-line multiplayer, the fun is multiplied, and the replay quotent goes through the roof.Buy it for single player alone, but you'll keep it for XBox Live!"
1,Educational.... but mean,"4 one thing ithink this game is bad and boring. I bought it thinking it would be good like aminal crosing or pokeman, but i was wrong. U shoot and hurt witch is just not good. the only good part is when mario comes in and beats the bad guy. though it is verry educational and teaches math and and english, its just not worth getting. i sudgest good games like pokeman dass and aminal crossing."
4,great but not without flaws,"i am not a gamer but found the first halo to be above and beyond anything i had previously seen. i had my order in for halo 2 when it was due out in april.the game is a marvel. the graphics are better than anything i have seen and the controls are much smoother and easier to handle than the grand theft games. the addition of the double wielding guns is an advance but takes a significant amount of getting used too. i do have a problem seeing the surroundings while carrying both guns which is a nuisance and has caused me many deaths from unseen sources. though it is early for me in the game, i miss the health bar and find it incredibly annoying that i have to find cover to wait for the shield strength to rise. in halo, you could lose your shield but usually have enough health not to die on the next shot. in halo 2, death comes quickly after the shield is gone.still, the game is visually remarkable and far above anything i have seen in my limited experience."
2,It was Ok,"The gameplay was great, but the story sucked. It was dumb and messed up. Playing as the covenent was different...but it was weird. The Game is a HUGE LET DOWN compared to Halo. The only good that came from it was the Multiplayer(halo multi. was better though) and the fact that they must create a better and new Halo game after that abrupt screwed up eniding. RENT IT DONT BUY IT."
5,Blows you away,"Halo is the best game ever. Not enough hours in a day to play it. Highly addictive, fun MP experience, smart single player AI, wonderful graphics, interesting plot, everything right in the right proportion. Can't get any better, but I suspect Bungie/MS will pull a miracle in H3."
5,Sequel to best-seller!!!,"Better Graphics, better gameplay, better repeat, better storyline, more weopons, more vehicles, more aliens, more add-ons, more accessories...what more could u want, best game in stores right now...san andreas is 2nd...Graphics- 5/5Controls- 5/5Repeat- 5/5Gameplay- 5/5Length- 4/5"
3,Too short and ending too abrupt,"Yes, the graphics are spectacular but the plot is clumsy and cumbersome. Master Chief---where are you? I wanted to spend more time with you than a lizard. This game is terrific in action and scene but it is not even half the length of Halo. I think the game's creators need to GET TO WORK and streamline the plot and 1) give enough play action to equal the first game; 2) keep Master Chief as the primary character; 3) FINISH the game with a superb ending or at a minimum FINISH the story line and the battle of the game. Good Grief. $50 is a lot of money for fifteen hours of play. Next time it should be at least 35. Back to the drawing board."
2,halo 2 what a lot of pish,so u played the first game and thought it was great and u want to repeat that gaming experience. well forget about it halo 2 is the biggest let down this year. Its game play is slow views are obscured and the story is not fully explained. throughout this game u feel completly helpless as the characters seem 2 lack involvent in the story line and compared 2 the first game play is no longer that 6-8 hours. Although graphics can be inpresive over periods of time u do feel that the game was rushed and because of this u feel let down by bungie.
2,"Halo, and Halo 2, the most over rated games in history","Let me summarize this game for you: its repetitive! It gets old!You will run around in circles for hours and hours trying to kill each other. Around, around, around, and around. If that rocks your boat (like it does thousands of xbox gamers) then feel free to buy this. Where is the substance?One other point, I am tired of hearing people refer to other games as ""this is a halo rip off.... this is a halo rip off...."" Guess what? Halo is an ""UNREAL rip off"" it stole every concept it has from unreal tournament. SO put that in you pipes and smoke it.I gave it an extra star for the graphics....if you MUST have this type of game, Id wait for doom III. At least it's a gory adventure game, besides a FPS"
5,Book for tough times,"I went to the book store and asked for a book for a sad 6 earl old girl who lost her uncle, aunt and grandma in a six month time. The clerk recommended this one. The 6 year old finds comfort in this read and keeps re-reading it. Well done."
5,In Freedom's Cause,I bought this for my 5th grader son who is fascinated with history. He loved it and highly recommends this book!
5,Historical Adventure at its best,"Old need NOT mean boring. Think of Henty's style as ""Jane Austen meets Kipling."" This book chronicles not only the life and times of William ""Braveheart"" Wallace, but also Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, as seen through the eyes of a fictional hero. Well researched, the history buff will also enjoy this novel of derring-do. Of course, Henty wrote in the convention of his day, but this only makes the book more quaint. His love interest is present, but gentlemanly written, much as Sir Walter Scott handled the lovers in ""Ivanhoe."" It is slow going at first, but once the main character (Sir Archibald Forbes)is introduced, the book comes alive. I suggest one google a map of Scotland to see exactly WHERE all this takes place, as the book well and truly covers a lot of years and territory. ENJOY."
4,"A little ""light"" to read","While trying to tell one of the most compelling periods of Scottish history, this book came off as a bit light. Not bad, but not great."
2,Hahaha,"This KID saves the life of William Wallace TWICE! It just so happens that Henty fits his characters into history and manages to make them do a host of fabulous deeds without it changing the course of history at all. Well, anyway, this is just children's fiction. So, in that sense it is OK. For those, say, under age 13 it might even be interesting--fascinating, for many."
1,boring and hard to read,"hello,well i found this book boring, and very hard to read for someone has trouble reading...i love history but i just think this book was HORRIBLE....I had to read it for a book report..and i am still having trouble writing the book report...again HORRIBLE..dont' get it"
1,Roomba is so disappointing,"I'd tell you how often I use this whole Roomba system (which I BEGGED for, my husband did not want to spend money on this), but I have long since given up on the hope that it would find our dust bunnies. It went to a charity drop-off point years ago.Roomba is something I'd turn on and let run across our wood laminate floors while I paid bills, made dinner, or worked on the computer. the whole downstairs was an open, smooth surface which seemed to ooze dust bunnies daily. Roomba would creep around, painfully slowly, for HOURS, coming within 1/4 of an inch of each dust bunny, and never ""find"" it. It was so aggravating to watch that I'd drop whatever I was doing and grab a real vacuum so I could turn off it's irritating sound. It was loud, and a FAILURE."
