1,Logitech Premium Stereo Headset,"As says the movie picture : ""Once is not enough.."" I bought two of these headsets. The first one had a very short life: microphone was ugly. Lot of noise when you are talking with it. More the earphone are very unconfortable. After 2 months, microphone stopped working. The pressure in the head is not wearable for more than 10 minutes. After that you feel like your brain is going to explode like a grenade. Your ears feel like stamps absolutely flat. My recommendation do not buy these cheap [well not so cheap] headphones. It is definitely better to use the speakers of your desktop [or laptop] and use a fixed microphone not very expensive [up to 10 bucks], mine cost me about 3$. Stay away of this cheap stuff..."
1,Right channel dead,"This is a bad headset. The right channel only works if volume is on max. Even then it might not work, and may require ""adjusting"" the volume control slightly around the max level or just placing pressure on the volume control and you might get sound out of it. You'll have to continue this until you find a ""sweet spot"" such that you'll get sound from the right channel that is equal in volume to the left channel.I managed to get this replace from logitech and the brand new replacement had the same issue. I've given up on logitech products.I'm guessing this was a known design issue from logitech and they still sold the item. It's probably an issue with the wiring on volume control. Probably using bad potentiometers which adjusts the volume on the volume control. Bad job logitech."
3,"Decent, but the Mic could be longer...","The headphones have great sound quality, but they are a little uncomfortable if worn for long periods of time. My main gripe is that the microphone is waay too far away from my face. I have to mess with it most of the time that I want to use it."
3,Basic headset worth for money,"I have been using the headset for a month, it is good for voice chat with skype, google talk. The headphone is not good with music if you looking for listening music too. I have no problem with mic so for and really clear."
1,Misleading Search,"This product is the second entry listed if you do an Amazon search for ""USB headset"" however it is not a USB headset. It has to be plugged into a computer's stereo jack. Please do not be fooled by Amazon's deceptive search engine."
3,Not very comfortable,"Although, the sound quality of this headset is quite good, I don't find them comfortable to use for more than a few minutes."
2,Actually it is not a noise-canceling mircophone.,"This product works good with Yahoo Messenger, Google Talk, Skype, etc., But it is not a noise canceling phone."
4,great sound,not much to say the mic works well and the sound quality is great as well. for those of you that are all about the materials use to make a product then this headset is completely plasic.
4,Not too Shabby,"It has been three months since I bought this headphone and it is still functioning very well. For that price this is definitely a great buy! Just don't expect it to totally silence out the noise around you. It's not BOSE or Altec Lansing and it's <$15. If you are looking for a cheap headphone because your roommate had been complaining about your music, grab this."
3,"Decent, but needs a longer mic.","This review is simple. The headphones are nice, but the earphones are uncomfortable. The mic stem is not long enough and therefore, doesn't pick up my voice as much as it should. I'm left saying stuff longer than I should be, but people can hear me. I hope this helps."
2,not so great for gaming,"For fifteen bucks it does a so-so job. If you're not an audiophile, it's okay for listening to music. For skype or teamspeak/ventrilo, its usually understandable but not that great. Words can sound a little fuzzy and sometimes hard to make out, at least compared to another cheapo logitech headset I had. If you're a serious gamer and require sound for footsteps etc., I suggest you look elsewhere. I was aware of these causing discomfort from previous reviews and can confirm it. In the beginning they were just downright painful, but placing them over my pc (I guess a shoebox would work too) has loosened them up so I can wear them for a couple of hours before my ears start hurting. As far as I know, the mic does an okay job."
3,Design annoyances,"I bought this headset for use with Skype and returned it a week later due to comfort issues. (I have normally-shaped ears.)Pros:* Audio - clear output through the speakers, good isolation of external noise, and clear voice recording with the microphone (no echoes or static)* Good price* Inclusion of wired remote, although the clip is very inflexible* No software to installCons:* Uncomfortable fit - my ears started hurting at the top after an hour of use, especially when wearing specs* Limited adjustability of the headband* Cables are far too long and get in the way* Requires a headphone and separate mic jack on your computer"
2,Bad speaker quality,The headphone looks nice but the speaker quality is very bad. It always sound like more than 2 things are going in parallel. I replaced the headphone but still its having same problem. I wont recomend this headphone at all for music lovers. It may be a workable solution for audio communication at sub $10 price.
2,Not Very Durable,"I purchased this headset for use flying online with MS Flight Simulator. It was a good headset to start with and had very good sound, however I noticed a problem with it right away. The earpieces are fairly hard and pretty small making it uncomfortable to wear after about an hour of use. I was constantly having to rub my ears, but that problem didn't bother me all that much.What bothered me is the extremely short lifespan of the microphone. I purchased this headset in January and the mic died at the end of February. Not a good product by my standards. It seems to be a flaw with the boom joint as it seems to have a loose connection in it. I wiggled it and was able to get the mic back for a few hours, but it once again died on me and I haven't been able to recover it since. I've given up on it. Time to purchase a better one!"
2,Not for Mac and Not for BIG Heads,"1. This doesn't work with most Macs. You need a MIC IN not a LINE IN plug. Get a USB mic and save yourself the hassle.2. This are REALLY uncomfortable if you have a large head. When you see a one size fits all cap do you not even bother to try it on? Well, these are the one size fits all cap of the headphone world. They don't rest on your ears properly if your head is big or wide and they crimp your ear lobes. Not fun."
2,problem on mic,"i'm sad that the mic is not working properly. it works but not loud enough no matter what i do. so i have to buy another mic because only the headphone is working properly. if i send it back and spend on shipping cost, i'd rather buy a new one. i don't know if somebody else will pay for the shipping cost if i try to have it replaced"
4,ok,"Not as comfortable as the Sennheiser PX100s that I got. But, there are a few great things about this head set. The cord is very long! which is essential to reach the connections on the back of the computer. There is an onboard volume adjustment, and an on-off switch for the mic, which I think are nice to have.Now, back to the issue of comfort. When worn directly on the ears, I have found these to be very uncomfortable, like others. The band is too small for my head, and presses the cups onto my ears, which quickly causes discomfort. TIP: I found that wearing the phones lower helped. I have the tops of me ears sticking out, and the phones press onto the center (and below) of my ear, rather than the rim.EDIT: Ok, here is another solution for the comfort problem: tear off all the standard issue padding (the fake leather junk and foam), grab a few cotton balls, and stick them in there instead. Careful, there maybe no returning, but I don't care. The cotton is allot more comfortable."
1,micropone headset,"This one has not worked on this computer, the headset part does fair but cant get the mic to be read by my voice activated software. Still working on it trying to see if it picks up but so far its a dud"
2,"Good mic, bad headphones","The sound quality on these are inferior to anything I've ever heard. If you aren't picky about your sound quality, these will probably be ok. The mic works great. Besides the sound, I am a female with a small head and these felt tight even on me! After several minutes of wearing, my head is sore. Right now, I just wear them around my neck for the mic and keep my Bose headphones on."
2,Not very good,"The noise canceling is non-existant, all it does when you put them on is tunnel your hearing so everything around you sounds like its in a tube. Sound quality is muffled and cruddy. Also very uncomfortable and you can't wear them for more then 30-40 mins because it presses so hard on your ears..."
4,Great Headset,The headset is great!...The sound is crystal clear and u can actually feel the thump when listening to music.The noise cancellation on the mic works great too.The only reason i dint give it 5 stars is that the padding on the earpieces is not very soft and it gets a little uncomfortable if worn for long durations.
3,So. so,"cheap, headset works.don't waste your money and time if you are going to spend a lot of time using a headset. very uncomfortable and sweaty ears. but it works.noise canceling!? Hahahahhahhahahahaha"
2,Not...the best game,"While this certainly isn't the worst game ever created, it is very far from the best. It comes across as a somewhat rushed sequel, hastily made to follow in the (somewhat) success of the first X-Men Legends and capitalize on the (at the time) relevance of the X-Men franchise. Gameplay-wise, it's an exact replica of the first, with the addition, and quickly vanishing novelty, of playing villain characters. The music, sound effects, and mixing also come across as extremely amateur, which you will notice almost immediately. It's a simple game without much of a learning curve, and the first half hour of the game will give you an accurate idea of how the rest of it will feel.All in all, a C quality game, and a decent way to burn a few hours."
3,Too many problems with the game,"I got half way through this game and then it froze up completely. It happened to me during the Archangel battle, and happens every time in that spot. I've even tried different disks (rented one and tried it in order to get past the problem spot), but it didn't help.$50 down the drain.I wash I could give it a review, because it is a terrific game -lots of fun. But if it doesn't work, why bother buying it!"
3,"Good, but ...","Very good music, but gets a bit boring because after the first 2 or 3 songs, they seem to be very similar in style and tempo."
2,A Very Weak Vac,"The suction power of this handheld vac is almost non-existent, it's ok for VERY small pick ups, but barley worth having around."
1,Stamped Sheet Metal Stainless,"The pictures and the mixed reviews will really throw you off on this product. When I received this Continental Classic Stainless I was very disappointed. You think the mixed reviews are varying opinions. Now, I don't think so. The rave reviews seems to be people that purchased more than 4 years ago. What I received has the appearance of stamped sheet metal, forks and spoons have the correct two dimensional shape, but the edges are squared, not rounded, yeah, like stamped sheet metal. 18 / 10 Stainless isn't even an issue. You have to wonder why anyone would waste 18 / 10 stainless steel on this. Out camping, this might be okay, but on your table, or given as a gift it would be very embarrassing."
4,Good quality but tiny,"Just FYI, this is a tiny harness, as in did not fit my extremely skinny 11 year old.Personally I don't see the need for this. If a kid is too small for an adult harness, get a full body. Or get a small adult harness."
5,great book,"This was a very good book about life as an ICU nurse. It many stories funny, sad, and everything in between. Many of the hardships felt by nurses and especially the emotional strain of dealing with the the death and suffering that these people face, but also the stories of the recoveries. I enjoyed it and had a hard time putting it down."
3,Not the best medical memoir,"I found the writing left a lot to be desired, and the prose was a bit overwrought and dramatic. A lot of over-emoting by the bedside type of thing. I was disappointed in it."
1,"Atheism is the default, Xtianity is an unproven assertion.","Zacharias is confused. Atheism is merely the lack of theism, like a-SantaClausism is the lack of a belief in Santa Claus. Nobody is born worshipping any god or believing in Santa Claus unless otherwise taught such culturally biased drivel.Really, there is no way to attack the default (atheism). This is like a Flat Earther attacking the spherical Earth instead of proving why the Earth is indeed flat.Instead, Christianity or theism in general lies on the examination table, since IT is a mere unfounded assertion. Weakly attempting to put the default, atheism, on the defensive is a transparent ruse to hide Xtianity from scrutiny.This tactic dos not work in the lab, nor should it work here.Dan Burke"
5,Sharp watch,"This is a sporty watch with a very classy look. The value well exceeds the price. It is easy on the eye, and displays the time using analog simultaneously with the digital display in the same spot without interfering with the other. Nice blue illumination, and has all the standard features of a digital sports watch. It looks very nice on. I am very pleased with this purchase."
4,not bad at all,"PROSvery good features for low budget watchpricesportish lookCONSband is held inplace with a plastic clip which is still good but fear it will breakand for scratching easily, i have it about month now and not a scratch on it(prob because im very careful) just saying :Pall in all not a bad watch"
3,Good watch but a small size,"I bought this watch recently. The watch was good and has all casio features. Nice watch definitely. But, the image in the website looked bigger to me but when i ordered the watch, I found it to too small on my hand and felt like I am using a ladies watch. Anyway,its gonna be gifted to someone as I dont find it useful to me. But, features are nice for this watch."
4,"Pretty good, just not perfect","The watch is incredibly light because it is all plastic. That said it does NOT look like a Swatch from the 80s, it actually looks pretty darn good. I've recieved just as many compliments about this watch as I have for my Rolex. Since it is plastic I am extra careful about scratches because I suspect it won't fair well in the long run, looks wise. I'm sure it will run forever though, being a Casio. I've noticed that I have a surprising number of Casios in my watch collection and they all keep better time than any other brand I own.Bottom line: Lots of great features for the price, just probably not the most rugged watch for the price."
3,Looks aren't everything,"This is as great looking watch,but I had to get professional help to set it!"
4,Great for the price!,"I bought this watch in November as a birthday present to myself. I was looking at some of the other Casio's with Atomic clock functions and when I couldn't decide, I purchased this for the meantime. I must say this watch is more impressive when it arrived. Set up was easy and I really like the look on my wrist. Have had quite a few complements and people could not believe me when I told them the price. Heard it is even cheaper on the Casio website from other reviews. For the price I believe you are getting a watch that performs, looks, & feels like a more expensive watch. I was very happy that Casio came out with a watch that is both analog/digital. Didn't think it would have good looks but this watch does for me. I highly reccommend the purchase of this watch."
3,Hard to read hands,"This watch gets most things right. However a very big, basic thing wrong is the face (and analog hands).* The labels are not 1, 2, ..., 12 like a normal watch. Instead it's 5, 10, ..., 60.I find this very unintuitive.* The labels do not have large tick marks near the hour hand like a normal analog watch.* Finally, there are too many tiny tick marks (they're all tiny!). The watch has *half-minute* tick marks.So many tiny tick marks makes reading the watch very difficult. If I wanted to know the time with precision down to the second, I would just check the second counter. There's no need for half-minute ticks.The large digital display negates a lot of these problems. You can just look at the digital time. However, if --like me-- you wanted to use an analog watch to tell the time, then this isn't a good choice. The analog hands are almost worthless in my opinion."
4,what you see is what you get.,"it fit the description nicely. the only draw back is the lap feature- it doesn't reset to track each lap time. it may if i play around with it more, but i've had it about a month and can't figure it out."
4,I REALLY wanted to give 5 stars...,"Let me start by saying that I REALLY loved this watch. I no longer have it because I left it on the pool deck and someone snagged it but I wore it daily for over a year and although I own 6 watches, this was my favorite everyday wear.ProsReally cool designReadableNeat graphicsBattery life lasted until I lost it (over a year)Intuitive settingsGood nightglowCHEAPConsThe band is relatively small. Most watches I wear about halfway on the notches. This was I was second to last and my wrist is NOT that big.The face scratches easilyIf it hadn't been for how easily the face scratches, I would have given this 5 stars no question. It's the least I've ever paid for a watch and also my favorite. Go figure"
4,"Awesome value, needs to be a G-shock!","I've had this watch 6 months now and it is a favorite.PROS: The functions are easy to use, the displays read easily, and the illumination is great when you need it. It's also not too big or bulky. The features work, aren't too gimmicky, and the price is great. I travel a lot, and this is just what I was looking for (without dropping $300+) to get similar features.CONS: The face is easily scratched. In the first week, with light use, the face already had scratches, and since then it has gained more. I can still read the face, but it is annoying at times to see the scratches. I cannot understand how there is not a G-shock version of this. Casio should at the very least make the black plastic face surround rise above the surface to protect against scratching. I would pay another $50-$100 for the same watch with a toucher exterior, and solar power. Aside from that, it is, for me, a great watch that I plan to keep."
4,Great Watch,"I have bought several watches over the last few years. This watch covers both items I am looking for in a watch, analog and digital. I don't like hitting the light button at night to see the time, but with the glowing watch hands I am able to tell the time. The other thing I like about this watch is how light it is, other watches that I have owned in this style have been very heavy. I do not know how long the battery will last but if it lasts longer then a year I will be very happy and would be willing to change this rating to a 5 star."
3,Good item but scratches easily.,"If you are a buyer looking to buy this watch know that when many people complain about the scratches that they aren't talking in vain. Other than that is functions well, and has all the bells and whistles I needed."
3,Easy to be scratched,The watch looks a little thick and is really easy to get scratched. Not so good as expected.
2,the lens get scratch easy,"Cute sport watch, the face isn't too big but the lens gets scratch easy and you ended up buying another kind."
3,Casio Men's Ana-Digi watch,"This watch has good appearance and moderately sized.Beyond that, it is not very practical. First, it's very difficult to set the time. Second, when you do get it set in one time zone, slightest touch around the edges such as putting on or taking off shirt causes it to change to a different time zone. I am constantly cycling the time zone button just to lookup current time.After barely 3weeks of use, I hate this watch so much that I am already researching for a replacement watch."
3,Not sure what to use this for...,"I bought this tea ball to use with the China Mist loose tea that I also bought on Amazon. First of all, I thought that the 3 inch would be too big for my iced tea maker so I bought the 2 inch...well the 2 inch is way too small for large amounts of iced tea. Also, the loose tea that I had just fell right through the ball so I am not really sure how to use this and for what???? I guess I thought I was buying something else. I think it would be great for infusing different flavors in hot tea...like cinnamon."
2,disaster,"This CD is a total disaster. It may be because the selected material does not fit her well, but that's her (and her agents') problem anyway. Go one track after another and see if you have problems to find elsewhere anything that is much better. There is not a single track where I would say - now, this is something special. Rossini being a most obvious example.I thought the purpose of the aria CD is to show abilities/art of the singer in various genres. This one just presents what Dolora Zajick has problems with."
1,false advertizing,the tracks listed for this CD is incorrect. If you look closely at the picture of the CD will you see what the track names are. I bought this CD based upon the track listing and did not recieve what I thought I had oredered. This is the fault of Amazon and not the seller. Buyer beware of Amazon's practices.
4,Great collection but HIStory might be better,"This an exceptional collection because they're all hits from an exceptional entertainer. The only reason it gets 4 and not 5 stars is because about half of the tracks are the ""Single Version"" or ""Radio Edit."" This means many instrumental intros and breaks have been shortened or taken out all together.The track listing for HIStory doesn't tell you whether a song is an edit or not. You'll just have to compare the lengths. If you already own Number Ones, you should get HIStory as well for the full-length tracks. If you have neither, go with HIStory."
1,Number Ones by Michael Jackson,"Like some of the songs but not all. His old songs were not included in this selection like the "" Rock With You"" and "" The Girl is Mine"" which were my favorite songs."
4,Very good,"This CD is strictly the songs that went to number one,,, so some of my favorite MJ songs are missing off of here-but this still doesn't disappoint- oldies but goodies like ""Dont Stop Til You Get Enough"" and ""Rock With You"" are on here. The version of ""Smooth Criminal"" is shorter and not as good as others I've heard... but most of his signature songs like ""Billie Jean"", ""Beat It"" and ""Thriller"" are on here in full form. But songs I have never liked, such as ""Dirty Diana"" and ""I Just Cant Stop Loving You"" are on here too. If you want to hear all of his terrific hits and a good diverse selection of MJ, to include songs that didn't go to number one, get his ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" and his ""Dangerous"" CD. Both of these represent Michael's best and most meaningful work."
5,Puts me in a good place.,"I'm not a disco-dance club sort of guy; more of the rugged, outdoorsy type. But if I'm feeling low or grumpy, all I need to do is put this album on. Next thing I know I'm dancing with a smile. Good stuff!"
3,"Nice toy and idea, clumsy and overly paranoid web interface","The toy's great, the website's fine - my kids love getting on the site - but jeez louise, you'd think Webkinz was the Federal Reserve Bank the way they make it so difficult to create a web account, log on, and save your passwords! You can't change passwords, EVER. You can't change the name of your toy, EVER. You can't change the name of the toy's owner, EVER. (I got two of our toys mixed up and registered one of them in the wrong child's name: too bad, no way to ever fix that.) If you lose that slip of paper that came with your toy, you're out of luck, FOREVER - there's no online registration so that you can recover your information. It's almost as if they WANT you to lose your information so that you'll have to buy another new toy and start from scratch. It's those inane and un-user-friendly policies that cause me to rate this toy a three."
2,I wasn't a fan of this.,I felt like it was doing too much. I there were segments of the story that gave me deja vu' and I found the bulk of it to be crazy. I didn't get out of this what I thought I would.
2,Earth has two moons??,"The really glaring errors in this book make me wary of the entire thing. For example: ""many of the planets have satellite moons, including Earth, Mars, and Pluto, each of which has two"" (p. 124) and ""the person having the majority (two-thirds of the votes cast) is declared president"" (p. 113). I understand that one person writing an entire content knowledge book is bound to make some mistakes, but these mistakes should have been pretty easy to avoid.Though after working through the book I feel like I have a better understanding of what I'll need to know for the test, I do wish I had purchased a different book. In fact, I WILL be purchasing another book because I don't have enough confidence in this one. Overall, then, it was a waste of money."
1,2 TESTS NOT 4!!! AND FACTUAL ERRORS!,"There are only two tests in this expensive book, not four as the cover pronounces. The test for the 0011 are duplicates of the 0014 that they give you - same questions - same answers. How they can honestly advertise the book as having four full length tests is beyond me. I guess they neglect to say that the tests are the same but you buy the book thinking you will have four seperate and different tests. It is not useful at all, very confusing. Also, there are factual errors in the study section. Don't waste your money or your time...."
2,Consider this before buying,"Although the tracks are brilliant, the quality of the recordings are NOT. I was rather dissapointed by the background noise and although I REALLY like Nabucco I can't imagine that this will be my favorite CD of this opera. Consider picking another recording and pick this if you no other option is available, please do!"
4,Basic Information For Beginners,"This is an excellent resource for novice students of Tarot. The author, Rosemary Ellen Guiley, presents each card of the ""standard"" 78-card Rider-Waite Tarot deck with a brief description in order to assist in interpretive readings.This book DOES NOT delve into great detail; nor does it deconstruct the dense, often obscure esoterica which appears on the Rider-Waite cards. But for someone just familiarizing themselves with Tarot, this book makes an indispensable first reference guide."
5,A Super Super saw,"This puppy ain't cheap but it is worth the price. Laying ceramic tile by making many cuts and nibbling away till a tile fits properly around a door casing is a pain and very time consuming. 5 minutes of time with this saw (1 minute to get it out of the truck, 3 to get it out of the case and set up, 1/2 minute (i'm old) to get down on my knees and another 1/2 minute to make the cut) slide the tile under the jamb and casing for the perfect no grouting fit. WOW !!!If the door binds on the tile, or anyother type floor, adjust the undercut saw accordingly and trim the door while in place! Your Done!!!"
4,"How to Find ""Bad Jelly the Witch"" for under $10!","For all people searching for ""Bad Jelly the Witch"" and being disappointed: Go to www.amazon.co.uk. You can buy it there for 5 pounds and they ship all over the world. Happy reading!"
3,Overrated,A good book on Microwaves but really overrated. Not a very good book as far introduction to the subject is concerned. It expects you to know too many things first hand. Even giving it three stars is a bit generous.
2,Not what expected.,"It has some compatibility problems with the SanDisc MMC that came with the MiniJam. I formated the disc and then I couldn't use it again! I kept getting fatal errors, even with the patch! Also, the 64MB on the MMC is only for music downloads. You cannot move files from your PDA to the MMC with the program provided. You can only use the 2MB of flash on the MiniJam module for PDA storage, which goes down to 1MB with the preloaded software. The MMC are also expensive. Better off with a MiniDisc player with cheap minidiscs than expensive MMC that store only about 10-15 songs per 68MB MMC. Not a value!!!!"
1,Small and useless,I agree with the former reviewer. These cups are very small. The description of them being small wasn't there when I purchased them.They are soft cheesy plastic. Too small for a drink.I can't return them because it would cost almost as much as just keeping them. The seller wasn't very up front on how small and cheap looking these things are.Something you would find in a dollar store in the toy section for a buck.
2,This author is no Max Allan Collins,"I am a great fan of the CSI: series TV shows and absolutely love the CSI: books written by Max Allan Collins. Eager to read another CSI: Miami book, I decided to give Donn Cortez a try. This author clearly does not have the feel for the characters and smooth storylines of the TV show. The book was filled with too many technicalities on rocket-building, etc., and is just bogged down with excessively detailed explanations. I am an avid reader,and this has to be one of the worst books I have read in a long time. If you want to read a CSI: book, stick to the ones written by Max Allan Collins!"
5,"Modern, and first class","I read O'Meara's book on the Messier objects, and eventually bought this one after reading the reviews on Amazon. I sometimes don't trust Amazon reviews because they are often too glowing. In this case, the reviews are accurate. This book delivers what it advertises, in simple, concise, and organized fashion. I like the way the photographic view is from a small telescope, which allows you to easily compare what you are looking at with what you see. This book comes with me when I search the night sky, together with ""turn left at Orion"", and my ""Collins star atlas"". I especially like the modern, color typeset and also the interesting historical introduction to one of the most famous Nerds in history. Messier would be so proud, and of course so surprised at how his little atlas of things to avoid became a timeless reference.If you want one text on the Messier objects, then this would be the one."
4,Yummy!,"I grew up near Boston and since I was a teenager this was a favorite restaurant of mine. The stories and pictures are terrific. However, I was a bit disappointed that not all of the recipes were from Durgin-Park. A fun read even if you don't cook much."
5,Of interest to anyone with an enquiring mind.,"I must confess it is over a year since I read this book but it has to be one of the best I've read in several years. Its ability to give an insight or recount an incident helps us look not only at the world in a new light, but also the people who brought about the advances.The range of history and the range of topics is very wide and it should appeal to anyone with an enquiring mind, whether or not they have a science background. I would strongly recommend it and have already lent my copy to several people"
1,Terrible,"I've had this printer for about 2 years now. As noted in other reviews, the paper handling is very poor. About half the time the paper misfeeds. A printer is supposed to print, and when this one does, the print quality is very good, BUT it just doesn't print often enough - the paper gets jammed so often that I just end up expecting it to fail. DO NOT BUY ONE OF THESE PRINTERS. I had a service guy come out and he acknowledged there was a problem and said that he couldn't fix it.I sent a letter to Xerox yesterday and they told me that it's out of warranty and that i could pay $322 for the first half hour and $61 for each additional fifteen minutes, plus the cost of the parts and any tax that applies.RUN, DON'T WALK away from this printer. Mine is going in the trash."
3,Start up paper jam is annoying,"I've owned a 6250DP for about a year. As mentioned in other reviews, when the printer comes out of power-saving mode, it often jams on the first printed page. I am currently experimenting with different kinds of paper to see if I can work around this problem. I do worry that with the number of times I've had to open this printer to take out a jammed page I will wear out the front latch.The print quality is fine, and the cartridges last a surprisingly long time."
5,Very Interesting,"This is definitely a coffee table book, however it is really interesting. I found out about this book when I was at what was called the Criminal Courts Building but is now the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center. Excerpts from the book are printed in murals on the 1st, 17th and 18th floors. Reading those flashes from the book made me interested enough to find it to read some more. Being a native of Los Angeles, I had heard of some of these cases. But I hadn't heard of others and reading about them was interesting. The case descriptions are brief, so if you want to learn more you'll have to look elsewhere for more indepth coverage of the cases."
3,"When it works, it's good.","I bought my first RV31 in April of 2001. Within a month, I got an H-02 error and the unit stopped playing. I called the tech line, who ran me through some functions. No help. Off to the shop it went. Two months later, I got it back - unrepairable. They gave me a new one (same model). 6 months later H-02 again. I unplugged it (one of the first steps recommended by Tech support), and that fixed it. A week later, H-02. I took it back and got my money back. When it works, it's great. But mine has spent more time in the shop or down than it has working."
3,OK THIS WORKED FOR ME FOR THE H02 ERROR,After 1yr and 2months of use I got the h02 error and no matter what I tried it wouldn't work. So I took off the case spun the plastic gear on top of the eject tray. I also turned the plastic gears inside of the tray. Then I opended the tray and inserted a DVD. Just as soon as the machine took the DVD in and closed i pushed down on the center of the plastic wheel on top of the tray and spun it. The DVD player picked up on the spin I gave it and began accelerating and has worked ever since.Just thought I would share with everyone and see if it works for you.Jason
1,H03 Error!,"The four and a half stars on this player are VERY misleading. Unfortunately, I too have now fallen victim to the dreaded H03 error, and got the runaround from CS. I wish all of these reviews were here when I bought mine back in December. I think there is a serious flaw in this model, as is evident from all of the negative reviews.I am going to write to Planet Feedback and whomever else I can find to get this piece of junk off the market. Ten months is NOT an acceptable lifespan for a DVD player!"
1,Caveat Emptor: Transport Mechanism Stinks,Transport Mechanism goes kaput after about 10 months or so.Panasonic (in its infinite wisdom) does not cover labor under warranty past 3 months. I was quoted around $150 as labor charges.That is almost the price of this DVD player and there is no guarantee this won't happen again!This goes in the dumpster after I send a scathing letter to Panasonic!
1,H02 Blues: Don't buy Panasonic EVER!,"Yes, I too am a Panasonic victim: worked great for 11 months then I got the H02 error code. Labor warranty has expired, and after reading others who got it fixed only to have it break again, I'll buy a different brand. This is the 4th Panasonic product in a row that had defects: my 36"" TV has to be adjusted under warranty the first day out of the box, my car CD player's random play doesn't work properly and warranty repair couldn't fix it, my VCR doesn't track the audio properly (also out of warranty after 3 months) and requires a compromise in audio/video tracking to work acceptably, and now the DVD player. I used to be a loyal Panasonic/Technics consumer, but NO MORE! I'm writing a letter of protest to Panasonic."
1,Same problem here,"Save your money and buy a player that lasts more than 2 years. For me, the money is issue but not as much as the hassle of getting a new player and installilng it and learning it and getting rid of the old one - waste at least half my day. Panasonic used to make quality but now it seems you are just as good buying whatever they have at the supermarket checkout DVD player. Panasonic trash. That's my rant. Product gets 0 stars."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS!,"Have had the player for less then a year, received the dreaded H02 error, unfortunately when I bought it, the player wasn't out long enough to see, when it worked, it was great. Now it's just been a huge waste of money. I'll never buy a Panasonic Product again after reading all of these reviews."
2,MP3 Disapointment,"Looking for an MP3 player to add to my stereo, only to find there are no stand alone MP3 players. Had to fall back to a DVD player. The only problem is DVD players playback in chapters, thus when playing an MP3 CD, you could hear a distinct 'blank' in the music when song went to next chapter. (each song would last over 3 - 5 chapters). A problem with the video portion of this unit is not being able to hook up to a TV via coax."
1,GARBAGE - DON'T BUY THIS! (H02 error),After 5 months I got the H02 error. Even when it did work it never was able to play movies that my cheaper player (Oritron 800) had no problem playing. All I can say is - this is an expensive [item that doesnt not work right]If Panasonic was a decent company they would issue a recall.DON'T BUY THIS!
1,Where's that trebuchet?,"After 13 months, the H02. I will try some of the ingenious suggestions offered here before I start looking for Chris and his piano launcher."
1,Color/Hue oscillates on all DVD's,The unit works and tracks fine but the Color would oscillate as I watched. It was this way out of the box. I tried this unit with 2 DVD's and with 2 TV sets. Shipped it back the next day...This model has quality issues.
1,WARNING! Don't let this DVD's high rating fool you too!,"I bought this DVD player after reading the many, many glowing reviews here. BIG MISTAKE! The true test of a DVD player is the ability to handle the movie THE MATRIX. This DVD player refused to play that movie AT ALL. Even the opening sequence broke up...before there was even any action on the screen! I immediately returned the Panasonic DVD-RV31 and bought a Toshiba SD 1700. What a difference! The Toshiba handled THE MATRIX with no problems at all. Absolutely no skipping or stopping. If you're wanting to buy a great DVD player for little investment, go with the Toshiba SD 1700."
4,Great Value / Cheap Feel,"I had bought a Sony 660 and then returned it because it would play only CDs and DVDs. The Panasonic is versatile. The remote does not have any bells or whistles. The setup menus rely to heavily on too small icons. The playback picture is sufficient, but it seems to be more more washed out than the Sony. It did play all of the Matrix for me. I am satisified and appreciate the versatility."
2,don't buy this player,well i have bought 2 of this player on november 2001 and both of them are just dies one week ago at the same time.the picture quality is good but week during changing scence sometime it cause freez for 2 seconde or totally stop and cannot do anything so it will force you to turn off power and start again with some movies.
1,Take a pass on this DVD player,What a piece of junk! Worked for less than 3 months and now gives the 'no disk' error. Panasonic wants [money] to fix it.NO THANK YOU...there must be a defect in the design since other people have similar problems. Buy something else!
4,It's Better Than That Oritron!,"I realize I payed a little more than I had to but I rather pay a little more now and have something that works than have some cheap junk.I don't have any problem playing T2,The Matrix,Ms. Congeniality,The Good,The Bad & The Ugly and a bunch of other stuff.It didn't cost a grand but it definitely serves the purpose.One screwup on Panasonic's part:that microscopic Top menu.It's very hard to see unless you're right on the tv.Although I still do prefer Sony,Panasonic/Technics,Toshiba or Pioneer over some junk like Apex,Oritron or RCA (sorry guys but your quality level has dipped severely)My superb playing and sounding Panasonic DVD-RV31 is on the money!"
2,Season 2 Crashes and Burns,"I am truly amazed by the number of 5-star reviews for Season 2. Seriously? Did you even watch the show? I did, and was extremely underwhelmed. Season 1 was very funny, but it's so incredibly obvious that they didn't have enough time to work on season 2. I wanted to like it, but I didn't laugh out loud once. I snickered a lot, but a snicker is only a half-assed laugh reserved for shows that are clever, but aren't really funny. I guess clever is enough for some, but I suggest you save yourself the time and money and get ""Eastbound and Down"" or ""It's Always Sunny in Philladelphia"" instead. They may be crude and (deceptively) stupid, but they're funny as hell."
2,Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Second Season,"The music in this season is inferior in quality and imagination to the first season. The humor isn't as funny as the first season, either. Every episode is obsessed with sex. The characters are still endearing, but the material just isn't as good."
1,One Of The Most Stupid Shows Keeps Going,"This show is like the Energizer Bunny, it keeps going and going... I've tried to sit through a few episodes, but this show is beyond dumb. Maybe I don't get it, but I'm not about to waste my time to try to do so. Sure, the guys can kind of sing, but the words that come out of their mouths has me racing to find the remote to change the channel. Hopefully, this show will go off the air soon, so HBO can find a better show to put in its place. I've been enjoying Hung. But these guys needed to be put to sleep a long time ago."
4,More Advanced for Kids,"Great Dvd a bit for advanced for age 5+ I'd say, but the little ones still love to try it."
4,Fun and enjoyable,My daughter is only 3 so her attention span doesn't hold out for the whole show but she is enjoying some of the moves and I catch her doing some when we're not even watching it. I think once she's a bit older she'll be able to do the whole show. She enjoys watching other kids and the animals.
2,Yoga Kids: For Ages 3-6,we were so excited for the kids to do yoga. Unfortunately the DVD we bought through Amazon skipped.It was such a disappointment
1,No black or asian kids = instant reject,"I have the 1996 version, so maybe they added more diversity to the 2000, but with the white kid on the cover I doubt it. Didn't even watch past the intros. It was nice of them to give each kid's name, but one brown child from India and the rest so very, very white rated instant turn off in my house. Ridiculous and unacceptable racial mix and lack of awareness for Yoga, a disicpline that is multi-cultural by definition, but often too upper class white in the US. There is a racism of exclusion and this video exemplifies it."
2,"OK book, helps a bit but don't rely on it by itself.","I would recomend using other methods of preperation. This book was ok, it did contain most of the information you need to pass. There were a lot of mistakes, the authors obviously didn't proofread this book very well. This book will become a permanent fixture on my bookshelf that will do nothing but collect dust!"
2,Golden Hits,The only reason I gave this CD a 2 star rating is the song are great but the quality of the recording sounds like somebody bought an old 78 at a yard sale and recorded it with all the crackling left in for good measure. Do your self a favor spend a little more money and get a good collection of Fat's hits.
4,Works well,"Works well. I buy this brand, rather than Laxatone, because I have two black cats; a large male and a small female. Looks like they are on the label. Great reason to buy a product, huh?Product is sticky, and best if kept in the refrigerator, so it is a little firmer. Only took years to figure that out.We administer a little to the female nightly, as she is prone to consippation, and her previous vet recommended a little hairball-control product nightly. We give it to her with a little tuna, rather than straight. Easier to give that way.Means that the make gets some tuna, too. He is a ""hairball factory,"" so it is probably good that he gets some.As there is tuna involved, they sit on the stairs between the den and kitchen nightly right at 6 PM.Having the female get a little of this product nightly is preferred by her over the alternative ... off to review Feline Pet-Ema."
1,Useless - misleading title,"When I bought this book, only two reviews had been posted - both praising it. Well, these people must have their names mentioned in it somewhere or get royalties, because it is absolutely useless as a techinique guide.I agree, the title is very misleading. As someone above mentioned, it is more about personal ""dynamics"" than fluid dynamics. It's so poorly organized, it's not even the good history book that someone else claimed.This is the best argument I've ever seen for not buying books on-line that you haven't browsed in person."
1,ordered a pair of large gloves and they fit my 12 year old grand daughter,"If you want a large size order an xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxlarge and they may fit. other than that they are really nice inferior, China made junk gloves. JHS"
4,overall very nice gloves,"So these are going to come very very tight. Its supposed to. It will stretch to meet your hand. When i first got mine, it hurt to put my hand inside them at all, but after a short while they will stretch and fit your hand perfectly. At least in my case. Im 6 ft even and i had gotten the mediums i think.the only real complaint i have is with the velcro. The velcro stitching itself is very very crappy, but is easy to fix with a needle and thread. I also wish it wasnt velcro so they could be tightened better, but overall these are fantastic gloves.I got these back in august for paintballing/airsoft/shooting etc, but i work nights outside and need to use a laptop, and got sick of pulling off my winter gloves everytime i needed to use the pc. I can type with these things no problem, and they keep the air off my hands making a big difference over no gloves, and i can leave these on all the time."
3,it's ok,"Nice little portable kit. It's always difficult to evaluate the fundus of the eye, but this is a good sort of inexpensive option for med students."
3,Maybe too bright?,"Seems pretty good except that there is no dimmer on the ophthalmoscope, so unless you are quick on your eye exam you may burn your patients retina (well, probably not, but they will be grumpy). In any case, it causes the pupil to constrict, making the exam difficult. But you get what you pay for."
3,So very close...,"I picked up this album in hopes of finding something that picked up where Marillion (with fish) left off. This is not it. Fish was a thesbian, not a singer, and that was what gave marillion its charm. This album if full of virtuoso progressive music, but it sounds more like Dream Theater (complex and intricate) than like vintage Marillion. It lacks the the drama and theatre elements of Fish's Marillion. When they try to be dramatic, they come across as cheesy. This is a fine album of prog, and if you like prog, by all means buy it, but for those of you in search of the ghost of Marillion, this one lacks the magic."
3,check pricing,"Good product, but Amazon artificially inflates the retail cost to make it seem like a good deal when it is cheaper to buy from a store or from Aveda directly."
2,Weak Hold,Wasnt thrilled with this product as it made my hair flat and didnt hold it in place more than an hour or so.
4,great,this is a great book for the middle schooler who wants to learn all the neat tricks that the kids are doing with strings at school!
2,Believe I was misled,"Due to product description, which at the time of my purchase said included TWO strings, I am pretty unhappy to have received the String Games book (which while good enough in itself)without ANY strings included. Feel like I got ripped off, especially since the current item description doesn't mention anything at all about receiving strings."
1,Not what I thought,"Dear Amazon.com, please do not include customer reviews for the wrong products. I purchased ""String Games"" and there were no strings included, despite several customer reviews under the ""String Games"" product mentioning the colored strings that come with the book. I was surprised to see that when my book arrived, it did not include any strings. Now I see that the customer reviews were not for the item I ordered, although they were listed under the item I ordered. They were for ""String Games - spiral bound"" which apparently comes with strings. I am very disappointed because I certainly meant to order the ""String Games"" book for my child that actually came with strings. Imagine that."
4,A Classic tour but.......,"Speaking for the guys, this was a great tour, but they should have put the whole tour on DVD. The spot light was on my boy Bow wow and Omarion. Good tour though."
2,What's up with this?,"This CD has some good songs on it, but the majority of them are less than 2 minutes! It's kind of a rip off since the songs are much shorter than I expected. They are mixed together, and sometimes a song is so short that the one before it is still fading out by the time the song after it has started! If you don't mind really short songs, buy this, but I wouldn't recommend it otherwise."
1,A disappointing journey into a TV sitcom director's world,"Alan Rafkin nibbles around the edges of, but never takes a decent bite out of the material that made up a lifetime of his work as a TV sitcom director. Here's a man, who, along with a few other peers, literally created hundreds of thousands of hours of TV comdedy that spans the earliest days of TV until the present. His book is mearly a glorified list of comdedies he directed, instead of a more insightful look at HOW they were created. For example, he could tell us what made the original Dick Van Dyke show a classic while subsequent attempts by Van Dyke fell flat. Instead, he provides a few examples of why this actor or actress was nice/tough to work with. Rafkin was there when so much of our video culture was created, but we never get a feel for it. If his book was a TV script, he would have demanded a rewrite. Perhaps Rafkin can write a sequel with more insight than his present attempt."
2,Not very secure,The strap on mine broke the first day and without the strap my light kept falling out. Cannot even use it now because it is not secure. Other reviews say the retention is enough but I totally disagree. Pass this one up and look for something else.
3,"A quick, light stretch, but not very rigorous","I got this because I was looking for a very short yoga routine to do in the mornings before work, and I'm a big fan of Rodney Yee's Power Yoga Total Body workout. ""Stamina"" is a 20-minute routine that does cover all the bases -- sun salutations, standing poses, one balancing pose, a couple easy backbends, a few sitting poses. However, the moves are held so briefly that at the end, I don't feel as though I've done anything. I've been practicing yoga for a few years, and I'd say I'm at a intermediate level. ""Stamina"" is too quick for beginners, because there's no instruction, and too easy for intermediate, but maybe if you're just in-between, it would be useful. I feel like I get a better stretch and challenge just doing the first 20 minutes of Rodney Yee's Total Body DVD than doing this one. I suppose I'll keep it around for days that I just want a very quick, light routine."
1,doesn't flow,This workout doesn't flow and is a very boring workout. The half hour feels like 2 hours. Bryan Kest gives a better more intense workout with great flow leaving you feel refreshed as well as having worked muscles and the 50 minutes goes in no time.
3,Light romp,"This is a light romp with plenty of laughs, quirky characters and lies aplenty. It is a fast read and moves very quickly after the first chapter. You'll have to be patient, though, as you must read half the book before figuring out Mitch and Mae's secrets and lies. If you can make that adjustment, you'll enjoy this little gem."
5,Great quick read,"What the Lady Wants was a great quick read with lots of mystery, romance and humor. I couldn't put the book down. The book had great characters and a plot, which these days is harder to find. Read it and laugh out loud!"
1,No Originals Here,There's nothing in the ad that suggests that these are re-makes. The deception earns one star... Save your money and look for these songs elsewhere.
1,"Wrong part, does not fit","The part that was shipped is significantly different than advertised. The part depicted in the advertized photo is correct, but the part that was shipped is much different. Even if I bent my AC lines to make them fit (which I don't recommend), the only way to make the connection would be to switch the ""in"" and ""out"" connections (also not recommended). VERY DISSAPPOINTED."
1,Don't buy this product!,"I was happy with this heater until something went wrong and I called BernzOmatic. They do not offer replacement parts or service. Part of the valve broke when setting it up this winter and now I have a $500 boat anchor. The part would probably only cost $5 if I could find one. Service after the sale is apprarently something BernzOmatic cares nothing about. Why should they, they probably expect me to run right out and buy another....NOT!"
3,High Speed Flight,"Richard Hallion is the master of Aviation History. This book looks closely at the USAF's X-1 program and the US Navy's D-558 program and examines the NACA's roll in shaping the avaition research being undertaken at that time.An interesting historical overview that gives insight in to how the USAF and Navy went about avaition research in their own ways. The book also covers areas of the much less topical D-558, a progam that was well and trully overshadowed by the Bell X-1."
5,I have read it five times now.,"This is one of the best novels I have read. One of the other reviewers compared it to ""Jane Eyre"" (another of my favorite books) and I agree. The characters have remained with me for years. Considering it is over 1000 pages long I was surprised at how quickly I finished it. It is very engrossing. I would plan to read a few pages and the next thing I knew I had read 100. I highly recommend it."
5,Tracks are...,1. Blue Turning Grey Over You 2. Dear Old Southland 3. My Sweet 4. I Can't Believe That You're In Love With Me 5. Indian Cradle Song 6. Exactly Like You 7. Dinah 8. Tiger Rag 9. I'm Ding Dong Daddy From Dumas 10. I'm In The Market For You 11. I'm Confessing That I Love You 12. If I Could Be With You 13. Body And Soul 14. Memories Of You 15. You're Lucky To Be 16. Sweethearts On Parade 17. You're Driving Me Crazy 18. The Peanut Vendor 19. Just A Gigolo 20. Shine
2,Not working for me.,"After a week my hair started to turn red.Not black,not gray...red.This forced me into a haircut,now looking for something else."
1,Rather one-sided,This books paints a rather one-sided picture of racial diversity and children may be misled to believe that racial differences are just a matter of skin colour.A little too sentimental really and not very educational or useful.
5,Great title,This is a wonderful book that helps educate readers about diversity. Should be read by both adults and children to further culture acceptance.
5,Best Book Ever for Self-Esteem!!!!,This book is very crucial for young toddlers who are now noticing differences of color and self importance an worth. I've even donated this book to my daughter's class.
2,JVC lamp + housing,"I'm another disappointed buyer. The lamp was cheap looking. The TV picture was dim, and the lamp quit after 3 1/2 months."
1,Save your money buy the real one,"Bought this bulb in April, less than 30 days it gets dim, waste of money buy the good bulb and save yourself the hassle"
5,everything as stated,Purchase went smoothly and the product works in our tv as promised.Shipping within stated timeframe as well.Thank you
2,JVC TS-CL110U replacement D-ILA lamp Housing assembly,"I purchased this item on 10/22/2010 for my JVC 52"" tv after the original bulb blew after 5yrs of owing the tv. Unfortunately, the bulb I purchased a short 3.5 months ago has blown again so I am not happy with the fact that I have to purchase another bulb. They are not cheap!http[..]"
3,Works - but not for long,"We purchased this bulb when the OEM bulb failed after having provided 2+ years of usage. The new bulb worked fine - we had no issues with picture quality, etc. However, after 3.5 months, the bulb failed. We have requested that the vendor replace it since it was obviously a defective product.UPDATE: The customer service from Prolitex is nothing short of amazing. We sent an email reporting the bulb failure and they responded with a FedEx shipping label to return the defective bulb and then sent a replacement bulb, via DHL, within several days. Given the opportunity, we will buy from this company again."
2,Not What I Expected!!,Be careful if ordering this set. The songs are supposedly sung by the original artists but these are not the original recordings. Apparantly the orginal artists re-recorded these songs and the sound is just not the same. I recommend you look for something with the original recordings!!
1,LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING,"THE IMAGE LOOKS LIKE A NORMAL SIZED CUTTER. WHEN IT ARRIVED (2 DAYS LATER THEN EXPECTED, IT WAS LESS THEN 1/2 THE SIZE OF A NORMAL GIFT WRAP STAND. AT $50 I EXPECTED SOMETHING NORMAL NOT A TOY. STEER CLEAR"
4,Very Cute but Color is Off,"Very cute product. Fits well and looks soooo much nicer then your average '3rd party' American Girl clothing dealers. However, the top is closer to a yellowish color. Pic makes it look Ecru or off-white. It's really not. Also... the jeans are very easy to slide on to an American Girl doll, however the top takes a bit more doing. If you are used to the offical AG doll clothes, you will know that they are normally outfit with a strip of velcro in the back that, of course, opens and closes. This outfit is NOT like that. So you do need a bit more patience. I suggest putting both of the dolls arms up in the air and dressing it as if you would a toddler.... thou it will still be a bit snug while you are putting it on. Once it is on it fits perfectly. (P.S. This looks adorable on Marisol!)"
5,panasonic rp-cdhg30 high speed hdmi cable-9.8ft (white(,i was looking for the best hdmi cable that could handle my onkyo surrond system and could decode dolby digital. dolby tru hd. dolby digital dts. etc. well it can very well do all of the above easily dont buy expensive monster cable all your doing is buying the same thing at a much stepper price.
5,Great price fast shipment,"The HDMI cable is good and the service was great, fast free shipment with the best price on the market."
4,no other book like this in english,"While there have been tons of books on HK cinema, they mostly touch on the popular movies, directors and stars. You hear of John Woo, Jackie Chan, Tsui Hark, Ringo Lam etc etc. But there are next to none, if any, on the history of HK cinema in English. This book is an essential read if one wants to know more about the political and cultural events that shaped HK cinema. Thankfully it isn't only just essential and informative, it also manages to be enjoyable."
1,BEWARE OF SEVERE OVERHYPE,so called Software Installer process Works ZEROAS WELL AS REPEATED REQUESTS FOR customer assistance NON EXISTANTSAVE YOUR MONEY BUY ANYTHING ELSE
3,Pretty Good but ONLY FOR MAC CLASSIC OS 9-10.2.8 not above,"Product: POPCORN V.1--This software will only burn DVDs on MACs running OS 9 CLASSIC. The directions for installing and running include OS X 10.2.8, however, if you are running TIGER (10.4) it will crash and Roxio ignores your support requests. I had pretty good luck with it, until I upgraded my system to 10.4.11 and now must upgrade to Popcorn 3. Popcorn 4 runs on Leopard 10.5 I'm told, but that won't be a choice for me. I will keep 10.4.11 until I upgrade to a new MAC. Someone should write a FREE DVD COPY software for MAC. This is pretty basic stuff on Pop.1.As for the copy quality, I've been happy with the compression and the quality of copies, however, you will get a few duds so prepare to deal with tuning-up this product and finding the right media to burn!"
2,Popcorn crashes MacG4 on OS 10.3.8,"I tried to copy a few DVD's, but every time I selected the DVD to copy the app would crash. I used a ripper to copy to my hard drive and when I selected the VIDEO_TS folder to copy the app still crashed. Even on non-encrypted DVD's that I created myself the app would crash. Customer service and forum did not provide any clue to what was causing the problem. Luckily Roxio gave me a refund without too much trouble on my end."
5,Great Place To Buy,Great place to buy strongly reccomend there customer service and expectations of product are pretty well off. Just remember the phrase you get what you pay for.
1,Pretentious stuff and nonsense,"Gary Indiana writing about hustlers is like Danielle Steele writing about field laborers. His views are all heated fantasies, with little actual understanding or experience of what he writes. The situations are clearly fantasized, and so the book has an exaggerated quality to it--and such clumsy writing--that the only reason to finish it is to see how really bad it can get, and by the end you're not disappointed; it's at its worst. Indiana should write about what he knows, like about a plain, scholarly type writing a column for a paper, trying to be cool and not succeeding."
5,I just love Larry,this is the greatest seriea in all time. must have- i got anything else to say on this pleasure pack. there is nothing that will be compare to larry laffer games ever. just buy it NOW. too keep larry charachter alive i bought lsl7 (that included in this pack) 3 times(!). this will give you a clue how much did I enjoy from it.
4,Made by me wooden vehicle set,Great fun for the grandkids an a rainy afternoon.Need more words to submit this review so these are they
3,More Game Functionality,The Jedi additions are outstanding. Better game feel and play but the flying can be challenging. Not sure if I am not yet used to it but it is taking some time getting used to it to be able to fly and understand how to avoid death.
4,"If you've got PS2 and PSP, buy for PS2","I've played in PSP and PS2 and, I tell you, you've got to buy it for PS2. There's a story/campaign, more better stages, better & options only in PS2.Please kill be for buying the game for PSP; & please take my tip."
5,A super game in deed,"Then you play it you feel powerful. This game is better than any StarWars game (for me), but it's a little hard to play."
3,not what I expected!,"Yes it is a good game but it can be a bit confusing and frustrating at times. The single player campaigns are too hard because your allies are too stupid and die easily. The Jedi ""enemies"" are too powerful and could kill you with one slash. Also, it's not easy to distinguish friends from enemies (but you can set an indicator icon). I hate the single player campaign mode! It's too hard and frustrating! Don't buy unless you can play online.Online play is the best feature of the game. I think I enjoy it more than SocomII, but it gets very annoying when there's lag."
2,A repetitive flop,I am extreamly dissapointd with this game. Every section and mission is exactly the same with the exception of the location. There is absolutly no skill involved in beating the game which i was able to do in 3 sittings.
1,star wars battle front 2,"in future please don't sell this game to kids in australia as it does not work on the consoles here, and it can't be returned once it is opened....Don't know it doesn't work till its opened"
1,stop working after first day,This would probably be a good game if it worked but after the kids played it for a day it stopped working.... they where very disappointed
5,nice handling and sharp,"very happy with this knife set; light, sharp and elegant color.i have to find a knife block for them because they dont stick to my magnetic knife bar.. hic hic."
5,Best Knives Ever,"This santoku knife is unsurpassed in my books. I do a lot of prep work for salads and cooking. It will cut an onion or potato like butter. It's a dream for tomatoes and all veggies. Not good for carving meats with bone. If meat is boneless, fine. Just remember it is a CERAMIC blade and can be broken or chipped if twisted or used on bone. I've been using mine for better than 6 months and it is still as sharp as new. If used properly, blade will hold the edge for a very long time. I've given several sets as gifts. You won't be disappointed."
2,Broke on first use,"Bought it for my mom as a Xmas present.on first use, she tried to use the smaller blade to cut a chestnut and a huge chunk in the mid section just chipped off.Returned it right away.I know it was not used for a purpose which it was intended for, but I expected better quality out of this knife. A chestnut's shell is not even that hard!"
1,Awful,"The product doesn't ship in the US, I was very upset about it because I know that the knives are excellent and cut through anything.Be careful because they chip easily."
4,Perfect gift for any true chef.,"I bought these knives as a gift for my dad who loves to cook, as per Oprah's recommendation on her 'favorite things' show and boy was my dad and I impressed with the quality.The knives are very sharp and excellent for any true chef in your life.Although they seem fragile to the touch, they are quite sturdy pieces and a great companion in the kitchen!! :)"
2,Sounds fake,"I tried not to get my hopes up when I bought this box set, but was still disappointed by the quality of the piano CDs. They are definitely not played on a piano, most likely on a keyboard, so the pieces all sound very electronic. I did not enjoy the piano CDs for this reason, although the guitar CDs are of decent sound and have a wonderful variety of styles and composers. All in all, the entire collection is a pretty thorough overview of composers, with names popping up that aren't usually found in these popular classical music collections (i.e. Satie, Faure). I found that refreshing, but since I probably won't ever listen to the half of the collection that is piano, I'm not sure it was good buy."
4,carpet spray against flees,"It took me few time to spray before I got rid of flees. Works good, smell little bit bad, but I expected it to be worse."
4,Car Radio,This stereo was purchased from Amazon. It arrived on time and in perfect condition. I am still enjoying my stereo and would recommend this seller to anyone
1,Not worth the money,"This tea is rather bland, although it smells good. Its also NOT earth friendly!! I would not have bought this if I knew the tea bags were made from plastic. So just a heads up to anyone else who dislikes plastic tea bags...Would I buy this if it was a paper tea bag? Perhaps... but I still feel that this tea tastes ""OK"" but not swell."
3,ok boxset,i just got my boxset its ok i have the other films on dvd so anyways about this review the 1 thing that makes me mad is the discs get scratched when u take them out of the sleeves i think the friday the 13th boxset should of been better i think thats my opion on it but other than it was ok i am aa big jason fan
4,Gran BOX,"8 discos, los lentes y una réplica (más pequeña) de Jason, Imperdible, cuenta con toda la información necesaria por film."
3,Not as good as the original series from the 70s,"The original Land of the Lost series, though its visual effects were primitive, often provided an intriguing feeling of creepiness and mystery that held attention. And it was rich and potentially quite deep as a sci-fi piece. In fact, many of the episode writers were respected sci-fi authors. Then it went off into a silly, lightweight direction in Season 3 (after patriarch character Rick Marshall left the show) and was subsequently canceled. This 90s version, although by the same producers, and although the visual effects are better, is just not up to the same standard. It is much more in the zone of ""kid stuff."" It's just more juvenile, and not in a cool, campy way. There just isn't the same depth or mystery -- nor are the characters as sympathetic. A real sore spot is the ridiculously silly pet dinosaur, Natasha. It would have benefited greatly from dumping Natasha, and instead investing in developing another subplot."
2,Boooooooring!,Very boring movie. Billy connolly sleepwalking through this flick - naive to the point of idiocy. Very little humor...just dull.
5,A Great Story,This is a great story. It is unexpectly funny. A laugh around ever corner. It is bawdy but not vulgar.
5,For all Elizabeth Montgomery fans,This movie is based on actual events. Elizabeth Montgomery plays her part well. She will be missed.
3,"X men legends II, True mystery","When the last installment came out it left alot of Unanswered questions answered. So who wouldn't have thought the next installment release wouldn't have done the same. With the Rise of Apocalypes it have only done just the opposite, such as why is the angle of the camera so difficult to readjust?, also when are the characters going to be able to use their powers during flight? Once you get past the intial hangups the game play is back to the original. SO if you are a FAN of the 1st installement then this next venture is exactlly what you are seeking for."
1,Don't buy this. DO NOT buy this.,"This is one of Marvel's more pathetic attempts at a video game. And probably one of the worst games out there as far as PlayStation2 is concerned. Why? Because while the gameplay and controls are fun, the actual game itself is filled with glitches, sub-par graphics, and some levels are almost impossible to get through unless you have a stroke of luck and find out what exactly you are supposed to be doing.Like Marvel? Like the X-Men? Well buy the game based on the movie, instead of buying this. This is just pathetic. Even the first Spiderman game was better."
3,game defective,"I returned this product due to it being defective. overall the game is great, i purchased it from amazon due to what i thought was an error in my existing game. after purchasing a new copy from amazon, there is a game gliche in it which causes the game to freeze up @ a certain point. I spoke to cindy @ customer service who took me through the appropriate steps in returning a defective product. the game was mailed on 9/19 & should be received by you soon."
5,Pre-eminent X-Men Co-op Game (other than Legends 1),"A classic in it's own right. Upwards of 20 playable characters. So many superpowers, you won't know which ones to use, which is fantastic. Replayablity is satisfying with finding easter eggs, unlockables, and added difficulties. I found that I had an A team and B team depending on who I wanted to use, when, and how. THere is no reason that avid PS2 and XMen fans should not have this game. Get it. Now."
4,Great game,"Amazing sequel to XML1. I liked the random character selections like Iron Man, Scarlet Witch and villains like Magneto and Juggernaut. I like the retro skins and the storyline."
3,Picture and Sound Quality,"The topic - about unexploded bombs - dropped on England during WWII is an important historial note. The DVD quality produced however was poor and except for dialogs of ""CLOCK STOPPER ON"" and ""STEAM ON"", much of the dialog was unintlligable and the DVD could be improved by the addition of titles in English.B"
5,Great show,We are enjoying this DVD of a show we watched when it first was aired on Plocal PBS station.
5,Nice WWII mini series,This is an enjoyable World War II mini series about a bomb disposal unit in London. I watched it when it was on PBS in the '80s and have enjoyed seeing it again. Money well-spent.
3,Sent back twice,"After a research, I really wanted this product. The first time it came, the screen was partially smashed; so, I returned it. The second arrival: screen smashed and no handle. I gave up on the product and purchsed the collapsable silicone basket. It is nice looking and if not damaged would probably be just fine. I gave 3 stars on the basis that it should be okay."
4,Fits in a comon Stock pot.,"It works good. the only problem that I ran into was a small dent in the screen. Easly fixed ,"
4,"good product, great price","took a chance that these low priced baleds would be worth using, and they do a good job (no Freud mind you) but they are well worth the price.the company shipped them in a timley manner and they were exactly are advertised. I would but from them again"
4,"Principles, not a manual","The person who said that this book can cut years off your training probably has a 9th Dan in tying shoe laces. The book is a great guide for any martial artist who seeks to improve his/her grappling techniques and knowledge base in general. It should not be viewed as a step by step manual. Principles and illustrations can never replace physical training, only serve as a guide and open owns mind to available possibilities."
5,Even I can bake!,"A friend of mine bought me this book to prove to me that even I can bake! She is an excellent baker & I would never even try because I was always intimidated by her baking skills. Well, it turns out - even I can bake! This book or should I call it a baking road map helped me so much. The format of this book is great - it is inviting and does not scare the heck out of you when you open it up. Usually I say, I can't do this stuff. But this book is easy to read and understand. Each baking instruction has a corresponding picture to illustrate the steps. When I go through the recipes I feel like I have Young Mo Kim in the kitchen with me - teaching me - guiding me - helping me along the way. The characters were also very helpful providing tips & guidance & very funny at times. A cookbook with humor - what a concept!! I recommend this book highly and will probably give this as gift to my baking challenged friends and family."
4,I'm enjoying these stories. . . really!,"First thing I said to my wife when I finished the first story was, ""Wow, Batman sure is a lame character and Bob Kane sure is a crappy artist.""But I really am enjoying reading this. The thing is I'm 32 years old. Batman's not going to surprise me, enlighten me or otherwise bowl me over no matter how sophisticated his world becomes, nor do I want him to. For me, it's about just going with it -- going with the story, the time period, etc. It's great. I enjoy thinking about how this material must have hit readers 65 years ago, and how this universe had to adapt between then and now. I believe this book is a great time capsule. That's all."
4,Kapok fiber,"Arrived pretty quickly. I don't know a whole lot about Kapok fiber and can't distinguish high quality product from less so..., but since i was looking for ""natural"" and less processed, it seemed to fit the bill since there was a little bit of bark in the fiber.Reason why i purchased it, was to experiment making a home made sleeping blanket/quilt with the Kapok fiber and a double Silk Liner (the ""shell""), for camping and hiking. Kapok is fairly lightweight and insulating, and quite cheap compared to many other insulating materials. No, it does not compare to Goose down in certain areas, but it's pretty warm, very hydrophobic (doesn't absorb or retain any moisture), and MUCH cheaper than goose down."
2,"A VERY basic, unimpressive introduction to Fidel Castro.","This may be helpful in a junior high docial studies classroom, as it contains a very basic outline (in less than 50 minutes) of Castro's life, and briefly touches on his time as Cuba's leader through 1996, when the documentary was produced. It consists mostly of (not exactly rare) photographs of Castro through his life, and some video footage of him meeting with Soviet Premier Khrushchev. Overall, this documentary contains nothing that can't already be found on Wikipedia (information and photographs) or YouTube (video footage).The final ten minutes is subjective, not objective, and consists of the personal opinions on Castro of people who were U.S. officials or journalists during the Cold War.Overall, I was expecting a lot more and remain unimpressed--and I certainly do not consider myself a guru on post-1959 Cuban history."
4,Bicycle seat,This is a comfortable bike seat.......especially for a woman. This is an exact replacement for one that I just wore out.
3,Comfortable? Yes. Effective for riding? No,"I bought a used road bike with this seat on it, and decided to put it on my mtn bike instead. let me just say after owning nearly a dozen different kinds of bikes/seats throughout my life, this seat is probably the most comfortable. But how does it work when you start pedaling like all hell? Hahahah, Let's just say there is no managable way to sit on this thing and pedal effectively. Well, I bet if I tweaked it enough, yes, it would be an effective seat, but stick this on your beach cruiser and not your mtn bikes!"
1,Waste of money. Avoid.,"I bought one of these for my wife, and she liked it. After one season of riding, the gel pads had both split and fallen off. So I bought her a second one the following spring. It looked the same, but was harder. The gel pads deteriorated, split, leaked, and peeled after a few weeks. I removed them and gave her a different seat. She mentioned how she missed her ""alien"" seat with the ""bug eyes"". I ignored it until this season. For Mothers Day, I bought her a third one. It has now had the first gel pad split, there is evidence of the second pad starting to fail. It has been less than two months. Her bike is always garaged and babied, I restore bikes and maintain about 30 of my own vintage bikes. Very disappointing seat, I hope to find a different kind that she will like. I now own three defective seats that cost me over $90 so far, and I'm looking for something that will be comfy and last."
1,The gel pads are the worst feature about this product,"I bought this seat after the original seat that came with my bicycle was stolen, thinking it would be an upgrade from the standard ones.The seat is in itself not too comfortable, as it is a little bit too wide for my body. I'm a 5'6 female of average frame, and it always felt too big for me. Also, it seemed like no matter how many adjustments I made to the seat, it always ended up being pointed slightly upwards in the front, which made it even more uncomfortable to ride on.The worst feature of the seat are the gel pads. They heat up under the sun, and many times I ended up walking with my bike because the seat was too hot to sit on for any period longer than a few seconds. I ended up removing them altogether so that I could actually ride my bike.I would not recommend purchasing this product, there are others of lower or similar values that are much more anatomically comfortable (and without gel pads from hell that will give you butt burns)."
2,not comfortable,It looks comfortable but it isn't. I've tried it for several weeks and finally bought another one to replace it.
3,quirky disc,"I have not watched the DVD, though I am writing a review. The reason I have not watched it is that disc one will not play in my DVD player (though my DVD player has no problem playing other DVD's). Thinking this merely a fluke, I returned the product and got another one. Again, I can't play disc one. Disc two plays, but I won't watch it till after I've seen disc one. Disc one will play on my computer, but I want to watch it with good sound, so, other than seeing if it worked, I haven't watched it (hopefully it will work on a new DVD player, when I get one). So, the bottom line is that disc one of the set appears to have some issues such that it may not play on all DVD players--it certainly doesn't on mine.The ""three stars"" is a bit of a mythical review: I arrived at it by averaging 5 stars to Neil (on good faith) and 0 stars to technical product issues and rounding up."
5,Neil Peart is Inspirational,Neil Peart's drum playing is so good he inspires you to do better. The DVD is insightful and offers techniques to improve anyone's ability. Watching his solos is amazing.
2,Help!,I bought this book because I wanted to have a variety of mac and cheese recipes to pull from.Here is the problem.... I want to make the recipe pictured on the book cover and I do not know if it is in the book! I can't find it!
4,Delicious.,"Marlena Spieler, Macaroni and Cheese (Chronicle, 2006)What can you possibly say about a cookbook that contains nothing but macaroni and cheese recipes? I can only think of one thing: delicious. Marlena Spieler has created another excellent cookbook, spiced up with gorgeous photography, that's full of recipes that are begging me to try them. How can that be anything but an unqualified success? ****"
1,Never received it,I have to say I am very disappointed because I never received this product. I also never received an e-mail from the company to tell me it was shipped or not.
1,You've Got To Be Kidding,"I think P. T. Barnum summed it up best: ""There's a sucker born every minute.""Don't walk, RUN away from crackpots like these. The FTC just won an $80 million judgement against these people. I suspect they will find some way to escape back to Korea and leave all their customers with worthless junk jewelry.Amazon, shame on you for even giving these charlatans a platform."
4,Just what I was looking for,"The price was right & they're perfect for my purposes. The only detraction is that the leg on one of the tables does not stay tight & ""lists"" to one side. My husband hasn't gotten around to gluing it yet. So I've learned to live with it & just kick it back into place when it leans inward!"
2,"Sweet and good, but she's not loud enough","I agree with Dale Miller on this one. Sure, sometimes a song is beautiful when artists sing softly, but she was overlapped by the orchestra too often, especially with walking in the air. I got so tired of it. the orchestra is great a and so is the song, though."
5,Tony's comments on Chloe Agnew's CD - Walking in the Air,"I highly recomment this CD!! Chloe's voice is truely Angelic and inspirational!! Have a great day, Tony"
2,Emile's reviews:,"T have read all Novels written by John Lescroart , but this last one ""THE VIG"" was a big disappointment. What happen John? I lived in San Francisco for 12 years and I am very familiar with the city I love. I will purchase his next book, because one disappointment out of many is OK. Don't reinvent yourself, you are a good writer."
3,solid mystery,"The Vig was a decent enough story, but it doesn't really stand out from the pack. In The Vig, a violent felon is released from prison in a case that Dismas Hardy prosecuted years back. After the detective in the case warns Hardy, he runs scared. As the book unfolds it becomes apparent that the killings going on in the story aren't related to the felon. There's more that's lurking underneath the story. Even after the felon gets arrested, Hardy won't let it go. With the help of his friend, Abe Glitsky, they press forward until they discover the truth. There's nothing wrong with the novel, but I just found it a little uninspiring. It's the kind of novel that I would probably forget a couple of months later.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"
2,Corrupts files that pass through it.,"I have a 500 GB Western Digital external HDD with an eSATA port and my motherboard also has an eSATA port. I bought this cable in the hopes of getting faster transfer speeds than with USB 2.0 or FireWire, what I got instead were a bunch of corrupted files.Everything I moved over from my HDD to my PC desktop was unreadable and any executable files were corrupted. They were also of a different file sizes than they were originally. Windows also read the external HDD as having less space taken up than it really had. As soon as I switched back to using a USB or FireWire cable all these issues were resolved. Don't know if I got a defective cable or if these cables are all bad but this one is useless now."
3,Worked for me...,"It's a cable. I plugged it in, and it worked, and it continues to work. So yeah, I'll say go ahead and buy it if you need a 6' cable."
1,Junk,"Well it worked, and then it didn't. I had this cable on-line for about 3 months same spot didnt move and boom it died. I know its not the most expensive high quailty cable. Although i've come to expect basic cables to last regardless of price as long as its not DOA for atleast A few years."
1,Don't Fit,"These wheel covers are slightly too small for the early Chevrolet wheels. They can be bent to fit, but you probably will put dents in them.Cliff"
5,Great Stories and Great Research,"The Illustrated Book of Myths is full of wonderful stories from all over the world. I give this book as a baby gift. It is great to read to small children and the stories will reappear for the children as they grow. Characters and stories from myths occur in much poetry, drama, essays, and fiction. This is also a good book to ""look stuff up in"" as one of my children says. The information is readily available and easy to find. And the illustrations are just fabulous."
4,Myths For Kids,"I think this is a great way to get children into myths. It has a lot of neat pictures and parents can read the book to them, if there still too young to understand every thing."
2,"Lamest of the ""Pat the ..."" series","We have ""Pat the Bunny"", ""Pat the Cat"", ""Pat the Puppy"" and this book, ""Pat the Pony"". It is the worst of the four and the one our child doesn't take from the shelf.Jack and Jemma visit Jack's aunt and uncle on the farm; first they pat the pony. Okay so far. Then they put on boots. The ""interactive"" part here consists of touching the smooth boot, which feels exactly like the page. Not only is this bad device used, but it crops up again when you can feel a glass of lemonade. Weak. The scratch and sniff rose, woolly sheep and a blanket that lifts to reveal a basket of puppies are fine. Finally, the tabs are flimsy, and needless to say they are already ripped out of our book -- a wheel that turns, ducks that float, and milk that spills -- or used to.This is a fun little series, but you would be better off getting ""Pat the Bunny"" or ""Pat the Cat"", the two best in our experience."
3,It's ok,"My husband, myself and our 9 month old daughter all fell in love with Pat the bunny. I got a few of the other titles, but found them to be more appropriate for older children, and not quite as good. Still a great concept, just doesn't top the original."
4,"Not as good as the other ""Pat the.."" books, but...","This is not as fun as the other ""Pat the.."" books, but my daughter still loves it! These have been her favorite books for months now (she is currently 20 months)."
3,Proceed with a wary eye,"The Princeton Review tries hard to provide the dry statistics, as well as some insights into the personalities of the schools. And this is valuable. But if this book is anything like their website, I'd be concerned about inaccuracies. Maybe it was the Princeton Review folks, or maybe it was schools' failures to provide accurate information, but there were very good schools that I had initially ruled out because The Princeton Review indicated they didn't offer the major I was looking for, I subsequently found out from other sources (including the schools themselves) that they did indeed offer that major. To me, this is a huge failing - decisions are being made on what one thinks is accurate info, when it is actually suspect. As a result, I wasted time, instead of saved time."
1,"""Libels""","An author should never call negative reviews ""libels."" If he has changed his views as a result of criticism, he should revise his book accordingly. I'm perfectly prepared to praise him to the sky if he would wise up.However, I doubt this is likely. Max Planck had this to say about innovation in science: ""[It] rarely makes its way by gradually winning over and converting its opponents: it rarely happens that Saul becomes Paul. What does happen is that its opponents gradually die out and that the growing geneneration is familiarized with the idea from the beginning.""In genenral, the same is true of attitudes about anything."
1,Where is UK in this book?,"Bill Emmott is right to skip the UK in this book. To paraphrase Churchill, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland is a very modest country with much to be modest about. In the twenty-first century, she matters as much as Canada does -which is to say, NOT AT ALL."
1,Is that the great JES?!,I've read the reviews of this book and thought that the reviewer called JES and who has given us an understandable-even-to-the-ordinary-person lecture in economic concepts could be none other than the Nobel prize winner Dr. Joseph E. Stiglitz. I'm a graduate student in Economics myself and I can only watch and admire from the sidelines as he tears the author's arguments apart with his brilliance.
1,anecdotal evidence,"With only the most banal of polemical perspectives and no aesthetic undepinning, this journalistic description of the recent fluctuations of the art market and its suppliers falls sadly short of the potential interest and excitement of the subject. It's readable. That's it."
3,This book makes dolphin operas? a secret review,"Although certainly with the pages are these words, these purpose built spores, likefeilds or kansas. And although again, like a cousin. I read this book and yet somewhere there were people outside the cover, some other story. Perhaps is pehaps is a juice box, what is needed here are vitamins. Such bitter health.Read about art maybe?for more secret reviews visit secrettechnology (add the normal web page bit to the end of that)."
5,Excellent to Lessen the Fear,"I have been wanting to start a web-based design business, but some of the details are a bit scary to me. A friend recommended that I get this book, and he was right! It's packed full of very useful information in a highly understandable manner and language.The business aspects helped me to clarify some of the confusing aspects of starting a business, and the examples of contracts is worth the price of the book alone.I'd totally recommend this book to anyone looking into it for the first time. If you've already dabbled in a home business before, you may find this a bit too basic."
5,Great Book!!!!!,The book help me lay me write a business plan and get organized. This book has helped me figure out my strengths and weaknesses. I think I got my money's worth and then some. Mr. Smith has pointed me in the right direction.
2,Disappointed,"I absolutely loved the first two books with Juts and Wheezie. When I read them both, I laughed out loud over and over, literally till tears ran down my cheeks. When I saw this book was about to be published, I couldn't wait to get my hands on it. When I read it, I was horribly disappointed. I don't recall laughing out loud one single time and had to struggle just to finish it. I felt very let down by one of my favorite authors."
4,A fourth --and funniest-- novel of the Chrestomanci Quartet.,"WITCH WEEK is extremely enjoysble for kids of all ages, though I thought it's not one of the best of the Chrestomanci Quartet. Many parts are so hilarious that the reader just can't put it down, making it a treasured novel for all ages. In the fourth -- and concluding -- novel of the quartet, humor and fright are in one very involving work. When a mysterious note arrives in a school that 'someone in 6B is a witch' , the class of 6B is frightened. Because in a world where witches are hated and burned at the stake, a witch is not a very good person to be. Scares break out everywhere in the school. Before the long, the culprit must be found. But the tow children that are worried the most are the boy who is undoubtedly magical, and the girl who most certainly resembles a witch. It's a very enjoyable novel, ans highly recommendable."
1,Insufficient direction/assistance,I have several other Rodney Yee DVD's and they are great. This one comes with no verbal direction and no time between transitions to get ready for the next activity. Poorly done.
2,Goes too fast,"I like and own many Rodney Yee dvds. This one just goes way too fast. You move in and out of the poses so quickly that I can't see how there is any benefit. Also I was aware that this was for upper body and I like that, however the moves are very advanced and if you aren't able to do a handstand forget about being able to do most of this dvd."
3,tries too hard,Who Killed Tiffany Jones is more of a gimmick than a book. The whole concept is a very clever idea but when you read it the whole thing seems stiff and forced. It's one of the few times where you can tell that the book was written by more than one person because it feels like a committe got together to work on it.
1,Share holders love his results. Employees hate them.,"The more people who follow Dunlap's methods - the more unemployement will rise. Bottom line with him is ""Don't seek help, instill fear in the company, and FIRE, FIRE, FIRE."""
1,Ecrasez l'Infame!,"For some interesting background on this two-legged animal impersonating a human being, refer to Mr. Floyd Norris' New York Times article of 16 July 2001: An Executive's Missing Years: Papering Over Past Problems.How did this miscreant ever get to such positions of un-earned responsibility?"
4,Focused on shareholders value and corporate efficiency,"Although dubbed as ""chainsaw"", I would definitely agree that if Al's predecessors didn't run the companies to the ground, he would not be ""chainsaw Al"". I think his 4 simple rules are good simple foundation of management and they can be applied to any size company. I would recommend the book, and will give a ""10"" if he could do the same for Sunbeam."
1,Buyer beware!,"Here's the postscript to the wonderful *cough* career of the esteemed *cough* Mr. Dunlap........By firing thousands of employees at once and closing plants and factories, [Dunlap] drastically altered the economic status of such corporations as Scott Paper and Crown-Zellerbach; however, when he attempted to use his methods to increase the share price of the Sunbeam-Oster Corporation, this backfired dramatically, as Sunbeam's stock rose from $12 a share to $53, and then within four months plummeted to $11 1/4.Industry insiders revealed that Sunbeam's revenues had been padded because Dunlap had strong-armed retailers into buying far more merchandise than they could handle. With the stores hopelessly overstocked, unsold inventory piled up in Sunbeam's warehouses. Investors grew edgy, then panicky, and Dunlap himself was fired. He agreed to pay $15 million to settle a shareholder lawsuit....."
1,What a Joke,I was told to read this book for a business class on what not to do and I think that Al Dunlap is in no place to be dishing out any advice. If you study the companies that Dunlap took over you realize that all of his improvements were nothing more then accounting wizardry. Besides he destroys the company's employees just to give him self and his wife first class plane tickets to Philadelphia. Just think before you buy a book about management style that you pick a manager that you want to be like.
5,"Perfect, just as described","The jersey not only stands up to the riggers of competitive play, but it feels and looks good as well. The jersey itself is made of sweat wicking material keeping you cool and protected when you need it."

5,Cute Collar!,"love this! my 5 lb chihuahua chumlee loves it too! he looks like a rock star. great quality , thick leather . This piece is not a thin, light piece.. its chunky and solid."
2,Good but too basic,"Good basics, but lots of stuff not covered if you own a wood stove.Like how to build a top-down fire.How to deal with cold-chimney syndrome if you have a wood-stove. (Solution is given for fireplaces, but not stoves)."
5,Essential addition to every OH kitchen!,"Having loved ""A Taste of Pennslyvania History"", I was so excited to get this book. Taste of Ohio History is just as wonderful as the authors' first book. Plan on getting every book in the series--I look forward to all 50 books (just ordered Virginia and anxiously await Maryland). The writing is wonderful and the descriptions of the restaurants and the recipes are such a great addition to my kitchen bookshelf."
2,not that impressed,"i wish i could recommend this movie... cause that would mean i really enjoyed it. unfortunately, i did not. it started slow, never bothered to establish the cause or meaning of these adult-hostile kids, and then ended with a rather weak payoff.imagine a zombie movie except without any zombies and lots of kids. now imagine the movie has just a few blood-letting incidents to its name... and some hysterical Italian overacting thrown in for ""good"" measure.not terrible, but could have been a lot better. 2 stars. wish i'd just rented this one on the cheap.Venger As'Nas SatanisCult of Cthulhu High Priest"
4,Great Read!,"This is my fourth Sandra Brown novel and although it was a quick, hard to set down read, I like this one the least of all that I've read so far. (Others I've read are The Alibi, The Switch and Exclusive.) The plot is fairly predictable and characters are not developed and described enough for my liking. BUT... this is still a great book and worth every minute spent reading. My favorite Sandra Brown is still The Switch."
3,Entertaining to read but not one of Sandra's best,"This book was entertaining but could have been better. The heroine wasn't very likeable. I appreciate her devotion to her child, her ethics, bravery, etc...but I don't like that she's a pathological liar. How about some honesty, even a little bit with the hero who she loves? Also, we don't even get to know the hero, John, until around page 200. I would like to have spent that time getting to know and love him. We only get to know the real him in the last half of the book which wasn't enough time to build his character.This book was 'ok' but not one of Sandra's best."
2,Fine until it broke,The title pretty much sums up my experience with this phone. I had it for less than a year and suddenly it was all static and wouldn't dial properly.
3,Second Time Around Was Good,"We bought this phone mainly because it had two handsets and was a reasonable price. The first one we got from Amazon was pathetic - the extra handset didn't charge at all, and the quality of the other handset was poor - voices breaking up every couple seconds, lots of static, etc. We returned it and got another one (not at all an easy process - the link to print the return prepaid mailing label didn't work and Amazon had to mail us one, which took 2 weeks; Amazon tried to charge us for the shipping on the replacement until we called them on it). The new one works well - all the problems of the first one are gone, and it seems to be a good phone for the money. The sound quality is good, and the answering machine works well and was easy to set up. The handsets are very lightweight, which to my mind makes them seem a little cheap and cheesey, but they work well so far. I do agree with another reviewer that the ringtones are not great."
4,Good phone with some minor flaws..,Phone has good reception. The answering machine can only be accessed from the base not from either handset. The ringers are not the best choices but are sufficient. Caller ID function stinks as it fails to add a 1 so to store numbers from caller ID into the phone book is patently worthless. Speaker phone is fair...
2,Battery charger problems,"I purchased this model phone 09/19/2004. For the last month my batteries were beeping needing to be charged. The replacement battery for this model Vtech are three AAA batteries. I changed the batteries and could not keep the replacement batteries from going dead on me within minutes of use. I read on another Amazon review that the phone was to be returned due to the batteries not charging, a problem I am having. I wonder if this is a common problem they are having with this model. I read on other reviews that the bottom of the phone gets heated when plugged into the base. Another problem with my phone. The phone does not sound bad when it worked. but for $120. You should get more than one year's use out of your phone. Not worth owning this phone. I purchased a Panasonic."
1,I returned it.,The static was awful and when there wasn't static there was an echo on the line. Three days and I couldn't take it anymore and had to buy another new phone.
1,Batteries...batteries...batteries,"I wish I would have had these reviews to read when I bought this system 18 months ago. I also have the dreaded ""check battery"" problems on both phones and the phones die in the middle of conversations now. Even after charging 24 hours or more. I found the replacements at ""Batteries,Plus"" but they cost as much as new phones $17.95 plus tax each. With this known problem you would think AT&T would try to solve the problem with a better replacement battery. Instead, they have abandoned this phone and they do not even sell replacement batteries. Avoid this product and probably this company also."
5,The Best in terms of quality and price.,After reading the reviews I was not sure about buying the VTech ip 5850 but when I saw the price for two phones(dual handsets) with Digital Answering System I had to get it. The system does not interfere with my wireless internet. I am able to hear clearly and be heard clearly. The phone recharges quickly there are three(3) distinct mailboxes for messages. There is an intercom system that works very well. Also the lighting and display is easy to read I can see it two feet away I dont have to get up and go over to see who it is. It was easy to set up and have running. The price is the best online and at the stores. Definately a great deal. I might get one for my parents since they have difficulty with their wireless phone.
5,Best Phone We've Had,We've had the phones now for several months and we were just chatting about how much we like the phones and that they've really worked great. The second handset allows great flexibility. No battery issues even when we forget to put the phone back on the charger for a few days. Nice speakerphone feature. Really a great phone for the price.
4,Nice & Practical Travel Guitar,"Before I bought this guitar, I try few other styles at some music stores, and I got very dissapointed with the feeling and sounds of them. When I saw this one, at Amazon, I like the fact that has more accoustic body than the others. Even though, It was a risk that I didn't try this guitar, I was right to guess about a better sound and projection because the ""biger"" body. Since I received it (a year ago), I use it a lot in my bed and at travel circumstances. Remember that it is still a very small travel guitar, it has less projection and volumen than a Little Martin or a Baby Taylor(wich its my favorite but expensive). It takes a few practices to get use to the small accoustic body. But It has a sound volumen for playing in a small family Happy Birthday party. It has a confortable and almost normal guitar neck size (baseball bat u form). I hope that my review will be helpfull. God bless!"
3,Mixed bag of history,"This is not a book to read cover to cover, rather I found it entertaining to pick a section almost at random. Read about log cabin construction on the Ohio frontier. Or Grant's own recollection of Lee's surrender. Or of T Roosevelt's family horse play (literally) in the White House. For those of us who do not get a chance to view original material, this book is fun."
5,Deep Chuggy progressive at its best!,"Some people always complain that Progressive house is to slow ,maybe for people who cant dance? who always need to be jumping up and down? I dont know these cds are what this genre is all about and should be all about. Journey into deep dark brooding basslines with chuggy drums to push you along into a melodic sway of dancing.way to go parks and wilson!cheers"
1,"too fast paced, not for beginners","I wanted to increase my flexibility since I have not practiced for some time. I found this fast pace not helpful since, you hardly get enought time to go deeply into any stretch before starting the next one. I was just trying to keep up the whole time, my form was aweful, and I did not feel like I got a very good stretch."
1,Way to fast!,"the pace is way too fast in my opinion, especially when the goal is to develop a flexibility..."
3,"Extreme Beginners Video, Moves transition to quickly","No doubt that Yee is a master at yoga with his grace!But this DVD is best for someone who has never taken yoga. I have been in yoga classes in the gym for the past 2 years, on and off, non consistent but found his beginners set extremely easy. My first classes at the gym was a lot more advance that this. You'll feel minimal workout with these. I would recommend going for the intermediate if you're starting out and work slowly into the poses rather than purchasing these series. Also, he does not stay in one pose long enough to feel the effect..by the time you master the pose he's move on back to downward dog, etc."
1,never buy from dvdlegacy,dvdlegacy posts low prices on used items to lure customers to buy. then it never sends you the dvds. why is amazon.com allowing this vendor in their website?
3,"Good Routine, Just Too Fast","After enjoying some of Rodney's other DVDs, I decided to give this one a try. I was looking for a yoga workout that would really stretch me out, especially since I run a lot. The routine is good, but it would have benefited from a longer workout time. Lots of poses but none of them were held for more than 2 seconds. Very rushed. I almost want to memorize the routine and go at a slower pace. Then I would feel like I'm really benefiting from the poses."
3,"Good yoga, but too fast paced","I bought Power Yoga for Flexibility because, well I want to become more flexible! However Rodney does not hold his poses long enough for me to feel the good stretch in my muscles that I need and desired. This is a good yoga video for a quick thirty minute session but not good for flexibility."
3,Not sure I love this one.,"I have lots of Ana and Ravi's dvds and I love most of them. My all-time favorite Kundalini tape is Maya Feines' and I wish she had more than one! This dvd is surprisingly MUCH LESS meditative than my others. BUT it is a challenging workout and really works up a sweat. ONe exercise I had to skip because of a weak knee. I might do this one once a week just for the sweat value, but honestly, it's not my favorite at all and it seemed rather SHORT! Also, there is a long intro to wait through that you can't fast forward through. I don't appreciate that at all. I like to rotate DVDs for variety. Now that I have this one of Gurmukh, I will not get another by her but will look for something else."
5,amazing DVD!!!!,"I have been doing power yoga for almost 10 years and just recently began learning the primary series of ashtanga yoga. I had tried kundalini yoga a few years ago and hated every second or it. So, many years later, after reading Gurmuhks book I decided to give Kundalini a second shot. I am so glad I did!! I have never done anything like this. I love the physicality of ashtanga and power yoga, but this yoga really gets you on a spiritual level!I think this DVD is a ""must have"" for anyone trying to better themselves and their spirit. I only wish it was longer!!"
2,Tae-Bo yoga,"This reminds me of a little bit of yoga with some Billy Blanks Tae-BO punches thrown into the set. It is ok for exercise but definitely not the yoga dvd that I thought I was buying. Simple enough for beginners if you just want some basic exercise, I would not call it kundalini yoga."
1,silly yoga,Totally silly yoga: I felt like laughing at myself as this guru wanted me to pant like a dog with my arms in the air for 3 minutes. The workout felt inefficient and neglectful of different parts of the body; no deep sensations of relaxation and release like you experience in other types of yoga.
1,Not African Textured Hair,"I am so sorry to have to rate this one star but this mannequin is sold on the premise that the hair is actual African textured hair, but it isn't at all. I bought this so that I could practice certain AA hairstyles like braid outs, twist outs, and shingling, all of which require African textured hair. But after you wet this mannequin's hair wet, it is curly and no longer is at all kinky. Very disappointing."
2,Nappy Hair!!!!,The seller was great received the package within a few days. Manikin looks like the pic there's several grey hairs through out the manikins head. The hair is too nappy to handle for me. It's so nappy you can't really style the manikin's hair :( that the only negative thing i will say about this product.
3,Good intro to composites,"This book offers a good introduction to the engineering principles that apply to composite materials in aviation. This will get you started with concepts, not figures. It will help hobbyists (especially RC builders) get a basic grip on materials and theory sufficient to improve the quality of your composite products."
3,item drop glitch ruins game,This game is a great follow-up to the first game but there is a programming problem. There are supposed to be items dropped when defeating enemies or breaking containers but at some point in the game this will inexplictively stop. Without health and energy packs and especailly tech bits (the games currency) play will eventually come to a standstill. Even Forge has no gear for you to buy anymore. Seaching the web I found that this has happened to other players and seemingly at random parts of the game. I suppose PC players can expect a patch but what about gaming platforms? I would suggest waiting to purchase this great game until this problem is resolved.
5,Fabulous!,"I totally love this game! My family and I rented numerous games for our Game Cube in the past 6 months, and this is our favorite! We loved it so much we had to buy it - AND I bought 1 for my 23 year old daughter. This game can be family fun - my 5 year old son plays with my husband and I - we hook up 3 controllers and play as a team! It's totally cool when we hook it up to the big screen TV!"
2,While it's not the worst game...,"You'd do well to avoid the gamecube version of this game, if you have a choice. The graphics are overly compressed so that everything looks blurry, and to make things worse, there is no contrast between your tiny character models and the admittedly detailed background. This can result in you sitting right in front of your TV to tell what's going on. That might be worth it if the game were a little more FUN. The levels and enemies are pretty bland and cheesy. My girlfriend and I were bored by the second level. There are at times weird text formatting bugs in the written dialogue, and some of the spoken dialogue sounds like it comes straight out of a backstage professional wrestling argument. Imagine Macho Man as Sabretooth and you're close. I don't recommend this game if you're over 13 years of age, you'll probably find it dull and sophomoric."
5,"moving, fast pace","Listened on Audio. Half way through first CD, wow gripping story. The slaugther of a huge herd of elephants in a game reserve for the ivory. But even the baby elephants who had played and romped and we got to know were slaugther just for being near their mothers. Then the story moves to a family with the mother dying of cancer. The story is a must listen to."
4,Textbook - Human Computer Interaction,Book was received in a very timely manner. The book was in great condition. Very professionally handled transaction and I would highly recommend ordering from this company. I will be using this company in the future for purchasing used textbooks.
5,Genius.,"Whether you prefer adult babies or baby adults you'll find them here. Or perhaps your taste runs to an oil painting of a roll of toilet paper. No problem.Everything about this book is pure genius, from the title: Thrift Store Paintings: Paintings Found In Thrift Stores, to the essay (there isn't one).it would be impossible to pick a favorite but I'm especially fond of ""Robot Attacks Two Women"" and ""Boy With Toy Duck Peers Through Rusty Gate"". Or perhaps ""Dead Tree With Giant Lemon On Chain""......"
4,another classic,"This is not the best ATG album in my oppinion. Many think that this is the greatest atg album of them all. It's a lot more ""blurry"" than Red in the sky... The sound is good but rougher than last time. Thomas sounds a little different, still pissed like hell! Even if the philosophic sense is present, this sounds more like a angry roar from the first to the last second. This is a true classic just like the rest of them. Some songs are a little to muddy and it is sometimes hard to seperate the instruments from oneanother. At The Gates has a new style every new release and this was the 93'model. Not much more to be said. Everyone should get a copy of this brilliant work of art."
1,Worst of the series,"I really do enjoy the ""Introducing..."" series of books. However this is a very poor installment. Unclear, jargon heavy and with examples that make obscure the concept discussed. Anyone new to Kant would be better served by ""Introducing Philosophy"" or ""Introducing the Enlightenment""."
2,Introducing Pedantry,"Badly done. If you want to be impressed by Mr. Want's intelligence, then this is the book for you. If you want to read a book that will introduce you to Kant's philosophy, then save your money. I took a philosophy course in college which gave me the rudiments of Kant but after reading this book I feel I know less now than I did before. It's a shame too, Kant lays down the groundwork for philosophy that has influenced many great thinkers since his time. I'm afraid after reading this book many readers will not bother to look any further into a philosopher that Mr. Want has rendered benign. Icon books should seriously consider re-doing this topic. Reading Kant's original works is not any more difficult than the text written by Mr. Want. Very disappointing............"
2,didn't meet expectations.,"unless i completely missed the point, i assumed the ""introducing...."" series had as a target audience the layman w/a desire to gain insight into more challenging, esoteric topics. this book did not deliver for me, and i'm usually able to wrap my mind around more difficult concepts with a little facility. don't expect any facility here in this book. i'm college-educated myself, and i've often found that 90%(?) of mastering a discipline is simply conquering the language; the rest is applying the logic. don't expect the author's use of the language to be any less enigmatic than kant himself."
1,"If it came with a 10 dollar bill, I'd pay 4 for it","If you have heard the songs on the albums covered, and ever read the album covers, save the ink trees and paper wasted on this lame caper. The lyrics and songs are full of misquotes, nothing novel or of note was wrote, paraphrasing the misheard words of spitfire rhymes I've heard a thousand times and apparently this punk ""author"" had transcribed. Other reviewers explained that is was a lame biography but showed stories that transpired that inspired the spirit of the lyrics you hear, but they obviously were as frightfully uninsightful as the writer. Let me save you the six bucks for the used with the truth: When it's slim spittin' about drugs, it's for fun and humor...When it's Em about family, it's addressin' the rumors...When it's a diss it's clear and every lyric is what your hear and means, love Em or hate `im, what is said verbatim."
5,"The truth is revealed, with little bias - loved it.","I listen to Dr. Laura occasionally, and have always wondered how one person could have all the answers and be so perfect. Apparently, neither apply.Dr. Laura is portrayed as a hypocritical mean-spirit, but there isn't much bias one way or the other. There are more people willing to talk bad than good about her, probably because it seems that she doesn't make many friends. Bane does a good job trying to be as unbiased as possible, and it's an entertaining read along the way.This is good information for anyone frequenting Dr. Laura's call in show; take her advice with a grain of salt."
4,Great Deal,Found the Edge 284 easy to asemble and use. It was less expensive than comparable models I checked out at 2 large fitness stores in my area and I didn't have to figure out how to get it home; it was delivered for FREE!
1,Not Happy,"I was very excited to order this bike. As I started to put it together I noticed that some of the prepackaged parts for assembly were missing! I still attempted assembly and noticed that pre-drilled holes weren't even close to being inline with the display! The largest drawback and thing that upset me was that I didn't pay close enough attention when purchasing this - it is DOES NOT allow for adjustment from seat to pedals. I'm 6'3"" tall, and not being able to adjust for my height makes this completely unusable."
1,Quite Dissapointed,"This bike had rust all over it, the stand for the digital readings leans to the left and it doesn't calculate much, if anything. Would have been great had it just worked right, we could have dealt with the not so straight stand and the rust but certainly not knowing the miles gone, rpms, etc is no good! This machine is just a piece of junk in the condition it came to us in, we are extremely dissapointed and will be looking into sending it back and getting our money back."
5,For a doggie addict. (like me),A B+ movie but it works for me. I love my Dog stories and it followsthe line of helping and loving.
1,Don't Waste your Money or Time !!!,"I was a combat infantryman with the 25th Infantry Division in Vietnam and Cambodia in 1970. I have tried many times to explain my experiences to those that have inquired. It is difficult at best. Most vets talk very little about their experiences. Those that talk the loudest are usually the ones that are liars. This book, coming 30 years after my tour of duty, does those that served a great injustice. Please read ""Stolen Valor"" and then evaluate this book and the author. I guarantee it will open your eyes."
5,excellent coffee substitute,"This is a great product and it was shipped safely and quickly from Amazon. I do wish Amazon would carry the chocolate mint. One reveiwer didn't like it, but I love it and I think others would also. My husband loves it, too. Different stokes for different folks I guess."
2,A Satisfactory Read,It is exciting and interesting how the two main characters meet but after that it kind of drags. I wish the romance between them was more developed. He is unconsious for much of the time that they spend together. I also found the country backdrop rather dull. I prefer the glitering balls of London Society. I have read other books by this author that I have liked.
5,Invaluable,"Recommended to me by an archaeolgist long active in Israel, I found this book quite helpful in appreciating a number of sites (and sights) I recently visited (and saw) in the Holy Land. For folks who are looking to learn more about various ancient sites than the typical tour guide can offer, this will be well worth its price. In addition to its being informative, I found the personality of its author evident and engaging."
3,Good,"This is a good album, but hardly East Of Eden's best.Oh yeah, I forgot--who the hell are East Of Eden? Well, they were one of the more song oriented progressive bands of the early 1970s, and like King Crimson and Curved Air and Roxy Music, used a violin. They, like Roxy, mined blues and structured rock songs to mutate into progressive rock, in both the playing and the writing,This album has some pretty good instrumentals and jazzy workouts. But to hear what this band could REALLY do, get both their self-titled album andMercator Projected. Each album has better songwriting, and the self-titled one has much stronger vocals."
2,Turner Ashby- Blood Image,"I rated this book very low as I was looking for a new book on a relative sparce topic Gen. Turner Ashby. I thought the book went into detail about the social ""southern attitude"" before the Civil War. I wish it had more ""Turner Ashby"" and less social commentary. I also didn't see anything new in the book, mostlyquoted ""Avirett"" who still appears to have written the best bookof Gen. Turner Ashby. I would like to see a writer take on theproject of doing a updated biography of 'Ashby"" as he was a veryunique officer in the ""Civil War. This book ""Blood Image"" did notdo that.Bruce Borden7695 Main St.Middletown, Va.22645"
1,This book is a complete joke,"This is perhaps the most poorly-written novel I've ever read in my entire life. The characters are stupid and wishy-washy. Neither of them actually elicit any empathy from the reader. I only finished this book because I was astonished that it had been published, much less got past the illiterate copy-editor at the company. I wrote better prose in middle school. I second the other reviewers: UPON PERIL OF LOSING IQ POINTS, DO NOT READ THIS INSIPID, INANE WASTE OF PAPER."
5,Grateful Autodidact.,"Professor Long is an outstanding scholar, but as important, he is an excellent writer and a genuine pedagogue. Not content with a vehicle for academic display, he manages to produce an extremely readable book. I am most impressed with his obvious devotion to teaching, as his careful presentation makes evident. After reading this book, I am very impressed with Epictetus, but even more impressed with Professor Long. Thank you Sir."
2,Skip it if You're Looking for Help or Hope After Your Divorce,"I wish I hadn't read it. We are at the ""after"" stage of the divorce and I'm looking for help and hope. I certainly did NOT find it here. At one point in the reading, feeling exasperated by the depressing facts of how divorce affects children, I skipped to the final chapter, to read ""What Children of Divorce Want."" I did not find any help or hope in that chapter, or anywhere in the book.If you are in a marriage that has any chance of mending, I recommend this book. If you are already divorced, looking for a way to help your children, skip it."
1,Dangerous book/Limited Scope/Disturbing Review,"Not only is Ms. Marquardt bias and judgemental she is joined in her limited scope with the 10/5/05 reviewer whose comments depict lack of common sense. I suggest they both read, ""The Three Questions"" by Jon J Muth based on a book by Tolstoy of the same. It must feel good to these two individuals to know that they know what is best for all. Perhaps they should ask themselves the same questions and still feel as though they can speak for an entire world."
2,Le Sage Gravity Theory would exhibit a Doppler effect,"In Le Sage gravity theory particles coming from below are intercepted by the earth while those coming from above impact the object and push it downward. But then a falling body will be struck with slightly less force while a rising object will receive a slightly stronger push. If Le Sage gravity theory were correct the force of gravity would differ for stationary, rising, and falling objects."
2,tough to get through,"This book (in my opinion) is for those more interested in XML alone than its use with ASP.NET. I was looking for a book that combined the two effectively, but found this one to be very difficult to read, with topics discussed without definitions (only references to chapters ahead of the current one), and little introduction to .NET or ASP.NET. There are very few examples, and even fewer pictures to display the effectiveness of the examples. Maybe I need to spend more time digesting the material, but there is little use of ASP.NET in this book... and even less integration of the two technologies. This is not for anyone interested in eCommerce or strictly internet programming."
1,doesn't work,"It sounds like a great idea. Screw a one litre soda bottle on to a plastic bottom. The seeds come out on the bottem and the birds sit on the rim. Just a dream. You have to drill holes into the bottle. You really can't use sunflower seeds, because they will spill everywhere trying to get them into the narrow top of the bottle. Then if you do get the sunflower seeds in, the holes are too small and the seeds won't come out unless you shake the bottle. Even if you shake the bottle, sooner or later water will get into the bottom and wet the seeds. And if it is winter, the water and the seeds freeze. I tried to return it, but the vendor wanted me to pay postage which would have cost more than the feeder. This is a classic case of buyer beware. So potential buyers--beware of this bird feeder and this vendor who refuses to give me a 5 dollar refund."
2,More trouble than its worth,"I found this item to be much more trouble than its worth. Most people like to take a quick peek at their photos after they take each couple. This device makes that very difficult. If you were in the field I guess this would be useful, but for most people a simple screen protector would probably do the job adequately."
5,"Tremendously funny.Lots of info & help(yes,help) on slacking","I think the 'Official Slacker Handbook' is a great expression of today'sgeneration by Sarah Dunn.Lots of humor in it & an idea of the lifestyleof today's generation;mostly in their twenties or even teens.I personallyrecommend that EVERY library stocks at least one copy of 'The OfficialSlacker Handbook'.It's one book you either love,hate or as the author,Sarahputs it,love to hate."
1,A disappointing weak flavored tea!,"I love flavored tea, especially tea mixed with fruit flavors. The mixes that I like in this particular Lipton Pyramid Teabag series, include Bavarian Wild Berries, White with Blue Pomergranate, and Island Favor with Peach and Mango. I bought the Harvest Strawberry & Passion Fruit yesterday, and tried one cup today. I must say that this particular mix has to be the weakest one in this series, because the basic red tea is weak, and you don't taste the Strawberry nor the Passion Fruit favor. The two ingredients that stand out, believe it or not, are the hisbicus flowers and lemon grass."
2,Not what I expected,"I expected a burgundy-colored tea (taste and look comparable to Ridgeways Red Berry).Instead I got a dark tea with not much flavor.Can't taste whatever fruit is supposed to be in this.The pyramids are kind of cool, though."
4,Aromatherapy Mist Lavender Harvest 4 Ounces,"The spray has a lovely smell and is not overwhelming. It is worth the money, and I will buy it again when needed."
5,Love lavender!,"This is one of the nicest lavender's I smelled in a while. Love it on my bedding. I find it not overwhelming at all, just enough to sooth. I would purchase again. Thank you"
4,Tastes Great,"I don't know if it really promoted weight loss, but it tastes great and is perfect on cold winter days. I will say that if I drank it late in the afternoon I felt like I had trouble getting to sleep, but that may be in my head."
3,Good Tea - not sure about weightloss claim,"Good Herbal tea - no ceffeine, refreshing taste. However, I cannot vouch for the wieghtloss claim. Maybe because I don't use it to lose weight or maybe because drinking the same quantity of any fluid (water?) before a meal will make you feel ""full"" anyway ....."
3,Lipton Instant Diet Peach Tea Mix,"I love the product; however, two of the jars arrived broken. The packing should be revisited."
4,The very best cheesy house,"Ok let me start off in saying I enjoyed this album. It's just fun to listen and dance to. It's not deep, intellegent, and the mixing is nothing to write home about, but yeah its worth the money. The track selection even though infested with an few bad tracks is over all preatty solid. The second disk gets into trance. At first I hated it but it slowly grew on me and by the fourth time listening to it I really liked it. So just once forget about and every thing and get down to some fun, funky, and absolutely groovie tunes with Cream Live"
2,weak cd,"Another day, another Cream compilation. What we have here is another run-of-the-mill mix cd with no outstanding features. CD1 starts with the almost laughable ""I Wanna Be You"" and moves through 19 other hard house tracks with cheesy vocals. Even though I despise the term, this could be classified as ""dance music"". This is what you would hear in some popular dance club in New York or something. CD2 is a bit more trance-y but still has that annoying dance feel. The first good record they play is Tilt's overplayed ""Flesh"", but they even butcher that by cutting the build so that the vocal parts are strung together..."
1,Are You Kidding me,"I love the axe fragrances ,the recovery has not been available for months. I saw it at Amazon and ordered it thinking it was a case of 6. $17.75 was for one bottle are you kidding me !!!!!"
2,Somehow helpful,I bought this book for a HTML class and it was very dissapointing. Even our teacher told us to disregard a couple of chapters because they were poorly presented and lacking information. I could not believe that I pay $69 for it. Still it contains some of the basic principles to get you started.
5,Food: Your Miracle Medicine,"Jean Carper in her book, ""Food: Your Miracle Medicine"" is a must read for anyone for anyone interested in curing themself by natural means. By the addition of certain foods and diet changes, I have been able to ease migraine headaches, lower cholestol, eliminate heartburn, and improve digestion. 3 cheers for Jean Carper!"
5,Fantastic book!,"My MIL gave me this book several years ago, and I have referred to it time and again since then for all sorts of medical ailments (mine, and those of people I know and love). I have literally 'fixed' a health issue I was having by not combining 2 foods, and my MIL addressed her tendency toward depression simply by eating Brazil nuts daily, as recommended in FYMM. This really is a 'Miracle Book.' I'm a fan of Western medicine, to be sure, but this book tells you how to live with and/or treat many ailments by simply modifying your diet. A must-have, in my household."
5,A beautiful heartfelt story worth investing in,"Came across this film purely accidentally but luckily caught it from the beginning and it was well worth investing in. It would be hard to describe the plot without giving too much away, but it is a beautiful story of karma, regret, guilt, adversity, love, marriage, and redemption. Other reviewers have already covered that anyway. The dialogue felt original, heartfelt, and sincere. Kudos to all the key actors for excellent dramatic performances. (Note the main protagonist is all the writer and director.) I've been waiting for another good story written from the heart (who says every movie has to be big budget blockbuster) and this is it. If you ever have questioned your place in the world and wondered how your past actions may have affected your present success/or lack of it, you may find this movie very interesting."
1,This is the worst juicer,"As another reviewer experienced, it broke on the first use. The gear stripped itself out and wouldn't rotate again. I had to send it back. This is the third ""cheapie"" handy juicer I have had in the past six months. I wanted a handy juicer for making a quick morning juice and for when I'm cooking. My food processor has a citrus juicer and an extractor on it, so I didn't want to have another big electrical item to pull out for just a simple glass of juice. These smaller juicers are cheap and poorly made. They are a waste of time and money. I ended up getting a non-electrical handy juicer from Oxo. It is GREAT! Not too hard on the hands for pressing down and does exactly what you need it to do."
3,PC Game,"It's okay but I will say the graphics is only fair. If you like the game, the graphics shouldn't matter."
5,Winner playing with fire,A sensational pianist at the beginning of what will clearly be an important career.Lots of fire and real musicianship.
1,"Pretty Pictures, Little substance","I was very disappointed in this book. The book is huge and expensive, and most of the material included has been covered elsewhere in better, less expensive books. One of the the most boring and repetitious books I've ever read."
1,A great book to hollow out and hide stuff in...,"This book is a big mistake for the beginning practicioner of magick. One would profit much more by reading ""The Qabbalah Unveiled"" by S.L. MacGregor Mathers followed by ""Modern Magick"" by Donald Kraig. About all this book does is show a million ways to do the pentagram ritual and claim that you will get somewhere by that. The fact that it has exactly 666 pages would appeal to a Crowley [follower] maybe or someone who does all their magick out of the Necronomicion perhaps, but the real professionals are getting a real laugh right now. It is a good thick book though, and you can cut out the center for a big enough place to hold a large bag of anything you want..."
2,Not at these prices.,"I bought this in 1999 and expected great things. I will say the color plates are stunning and you just won't find that stuff in most of the other GD books out there. It's true the author does present several interesting Ideas. Unfortunately the bulk of this work's 666 pages is an exposition of 10-20 pages in the original order papers, essentially making this a cookbook for those who can not memorize the hierarchies, draw sigils from the rose on the fly, or keep the pentagram and hexagram rituals straight in their heads. And those skills were the point of inner order training. Which leaves the impression that the author missed the point (that one at least). To be fair it was early in his career. I don't remember the 1999 price but $240 seems abit much in spite of the lovely color plates. $1000 ? not even if it came with a free charter."
5,A MUST for every transplant patinet and their families!,"This comprehensive guide leads the lung trasnplant patient through the transplant process and addresses every questions from pre transplant evaluation through post transplant recovery and pulmonary rehabilitaion. Included are quotes from transplant recipients in which they share their experience regarding a particular part of the transplant process which makes me feel like I am not in this alone. I referred to this guide every step of my transplant journey and have recommended it to hundreds of transplant patients. This book is the definative guide for all my transplant questions. I wouldn't be without it.Tom ArcherPresidentSecond Wind Lung Transplant Association, Inc"
4,"Exactly what I needed, at a great price","This was the exact product recommended on the Kodak site, but at a much better price. The shipping was impressively quick. It works well, was exactly what I needed, and, as always, was a great experience shopping on Amazon.com."
4,Wanting more,"The first fourth of the book contains a lot of valuable information about styles and techniques, then the rest is page after page of photos. Beautiful photos, but I wish there was more discussion about cultural significance of the designs depicted."
4,Still one of the best Documentary on Bigfoot,"I bought this Documentary 4 years ago ( for 30$ ) and I still believe that this is one of the best documentary about Bigfoot. The first two chapters are by far the best chapters, I still watch them very often. The other chapters are ok, but nothing extraordinary.If you are a real fan of The Bigfoot phenomenon then go ahead, buy this DVD. For less than 10$ it's a very, very good buy. The documentary is a little short ( less than 50 minutes ) but for less than 10$ you can't go wrong. :)"
5,TheFlash797,"I know the singer personally, but never thought I'd love this album, and the previous ones as well."
1,Snake Chain,"This necklace is very pretty. The only problem with this necklace is the spring ring clasp. The necklace clasp turns and catches the underside of my hair. Ouch! I had to cut the hair from the chain. Until I take it to change the clasp, it will be pony tail only necklace."
2,Average,"There was nothing wrong with this book, although I feel like I've read it before. Same family saga searching for the past, same precious writing. The puerto Rican segments make it a little more interesting, but not by much."
5,Best Tracy-Hepburn movie!,"This is the best Spencer Tracy-Katherine Hepburn movie I've ever seen. Wonderful dialogue and bits, funny, and just plain sweet."
4,Tracy and Hepburn at their best,"There are so many quotable exchanges between Tracy and Hepburn, and ones that apply to modern day life in business, it may, in some ways, be more apropos than some of the current comic strips based on office life. At one point, Tracy asks Hepburn if she likes working in the company in question. Her answer, tinged with a little sarcasm, was that if she weren't already working there, she'd ""pay to get in."" The only downside of this lanmark Cinemascope picture is that the video is not in letterbox format. But it's great fun, and especially amusing for all who earn their living in an office."
5,One of the best Hepburn movies around!,I love this movie. I saw the play it was based on and thought they did a good job adapting it for the screen. Trivia: Watch the for the guy that plays Smithers. He played Spencer Tracy's character in the play. Hepburn is great. The office Christmas party and the quasi-interview on the roof are two of the best scenes. You must see this!
2,Very grainy DVD,This is one of the grainiest transfers I have ever seen on DVD.I nearly completely ruins a delightful movie.
5,FINALLY,"its nice to know that warner home video still releases dvd's!,not jsut dvd-r's.im thankful that all of thier films are being released in a collection. i was dissapinted with the collection released some years ago. ""Desk Set"" is definatley my favorite, ""Keeper of the flame"" seems good,i need to see it. ""Guess whos coming to dinner"" of course,is wonderful,im not crazy about films like ""Adams's rib"" and ""Pat and mike"" but the others are very good. would REALLY REALLY like if warner home video would put out a Joan Crawford & Clark Gable collection."
1,Manufacturer's Defect,"Great set, beautiful, but Sea of Grass has defect... it switches to another movie in the middle and doesn't switch back. Wait until Amazon gets this resolved before you buy it. That's the ONLY reason I gave it one star."
5,Desk Set is wonderful!,I love this movie. I am a software engineer and the 1957 view of computers in this movie is priceless!
1,Mis-Labeled Size,The shoe looks great and is good quality but the size 8W turned out to actually be a size 10. It wasn't just a shipping mistake - the shoes were labeled 8W. Way too big for me. I have no idea how to predict what size you would end up with based on the size you order.
4,They almost got it perfect...,"I bought this manual mainly for torque specs and wiring/hose diagrams.... and it was pretty good!...But I don't see any hose routing diagram for the 440/550... (which of course is what I NEEDED) ... there is one for the 300, there is one for the 650s (sx, x2) but not the 440/550's!!!beyond that MAJOR overisght it's a good manual, if I'd have known of this shortcoming, I would have just ordered the Kawasaki manual (Which I would have preferred to begin with, but the wait for shipping was the deciding factor)"
3,Average Dance Pad...,"I bought this product and received it within a week's time with ground shipping. It came all folded up, which seemed like it would damage the pad, but it did not once unfolded and laid flat on the floor for a little time. The pad worked fine with or without the extra 1-inch padding. The only problem was the corner arrows were very sensitive, making the dancer be very precise so another arrow is not stepped on at the same time causing errors. The product overall looks like it can last longer than most models if used appropriately..."
4,HP Backpack review,"This is a great backpack. There is lots of room for all your gear and a 17"" laptop. There are many pockets to organize anything you can carry. Well padded too. Great buy at a great price."
5,save my soul,"i havent even bought this cd, just know a good few of the tracks on it, and like my predecessors who have already said that eugene is a fool, i agree! save my soul is a f'in tune in its own right, u really must not know your tunes. so im gonna give it 5 stars, cos i know its good b4 ive even bought it."
5,From Palace to Prison,"Naraghi's book clearfies some of the issues that were rumored at the end of the Shah's regime and furtheremore, gives very good insight about Shah's inter personality. The latter part of the book verifies the disbelief that Ayatollah Khomeini and the Mullahs had about the sudden grab of full power and lack of the know-how to handle it which is continuing today. It is a battle between mystic religion and modern day changes. The author has avoided self glorification which happens in many of similar books.He has given an in depth and true view of the events of those days. I know. I was in a similar situation as was the author. Definitely worth reading."
3,I'm speechless,I cannot believe that these two idiots ( husband and wife featured in this episode) run a buiness of ANY kind.
1,NO BONUS FEATURES!,"I would have given this DVD a 5-star rating, but after buying it from Amazon and watching, I was so frustrated to find out that there weren't any Bonus Features on Disc 2 as promised on the packaging. I struggled to search for the ""alleged"" bonus features -- in fact, I've plugged the DVD on almost all DVD-playing machines, from DVD & Bluray players to computers -- only to be disappointed that there were no ""never-before-seen bonus features with tips from Tabatha.""BRAVO what's up?! Is this a case of false advertising, or was I just unlucky to have been sent a faulty disc? Please enlighten me please. PLEASE."
3,"Good set, but...","I received the older version of this set (which came in a canvas roll-up bag rather than a hard-sided case) as a gift. It's a great set...heavy duty equipment, etc.But, the grill brush/scrubber came with only one replacement scrubber head, and one replacement brush head. I've used the set enough that I've pretty much used up all the functionality of the ones that came in the set.Unfortunately, I can't seem to find a replacement set on Amazon or Brookstone's website, so I'm left with part of the set being unuseable now."
1,Don't Buy It,"This book is a fictionalized account of the torture murder of Sylvia Likens in 1965 Indianapolis. It represents the author's attempt to cash in on a horrible tragedy. I would recommend reading ""House of Evil"" by John Dean instead. Dean's book is an account of the actual case, not an exploitative work of fiction that adds made-up methods of torture that are even sicker than the ones carried out by the depraved group who actually committed this horrible crime. If you want to read good horror, check out Bentley Little, who has enough of an imagination that he doesn't have to draw on real-life tragedies to make a buck."
2,The Girl Next Door,"This book was certainly disturbing, but really not worth all of the time and effort I had to put in to locating a copy. His books are fairly difficult to find and I really do not find the writing to be any more disturbing than many of the other popular ""horror"" authors."
2,Not much beyond shock value,"Very disappointed in this book. The characters were left undeveloped, and there was no real plot. The story focuses on the torture and eventual death of a teenage girl at the hands of her guardian, a single mother, and the neighborhood children. I am not a squeamish person, but I found this book to be disturbing not in terms of a story line (there wasn't one) but because its only purpose seemed to be to describe the horror of a young girl. An exploration into the psyches of her perpetrators would have lent the book some sense. As it was, I couldn't wait for it to end."
3,Horrifying yet fascinating,"This book shows just how depraved people can be. It was chilling and disturbing, but I could not put it down."
5,I've never been more Frightened by a Book,"As i have said above I have never been more frightened by a book in my whole life. Consiquently, i also haden't been more grossed out by a book either. I say this was exactly what i was looking for and i finally found it. Be careful what you wish for never fit in a better situation. And then i found out it was based on a true story.After i completed reading it, i felt sick to my stomach. I have never had that feeling from a book before. It got me thinking about the things that happened and those who participated in the events that let it happen. Its an eye opener and i think that exactly what the author accomplished what he was looking to do.Suffice to say he is my new favorite author."
3,Not for the weak!,"This is a very difficult book. The subject matter is tough, dealing with child abuse. It is not that well written but it does drag you along in the story and yet is horrifying. I could only hope that it is fiction that has no basis in reality."
1,Wow,"This book is a literary snuff film. If you are into that, by all means purchase. But for this to top a list of horror novels is an insult. I am an avid reader, and i typically love the gory and gruesome. But this is a new level for me.I'm guessing my reaction is exactly what the author is looking for, but child rape? Really?"
4,Grim,"I just finished this book and it really lingers in the brain and soul.I put it down for several days at a time because it is so horrific.It really boggles the mind that humans can treat other humans with such cruelty, especially children. I really wanted to finish it to find out the punishment these people received.The book is wonderfully written by Jack Ketchum through the eyes of a child who knew what was wrong but couldn't confide in an adult.Even though the subject is really grim, I don't think you will be able to put it down either."
3,Harsh reality...difficult to read.,"I have a really difficult time dealing with child abuse. I enjoy suspense and mystery novels but I guess I like keeping my head in the sand when it comes to facing the fact that there are people sharing my world who are this sick and demented. The Girl Next Door was very well written and was based on reality and it sure made me aware that I am capable of truly and deeply hating someone! If I could have gotten my hands on that mother, she would have been history! NOT a comfortable feeling."
2,I know I'm in the minority but...,"...frankly, I can't see any reason to read this book. If you're interested in the true story on which it's based, look on Court TV's site, or search for Sylvia Likens, and read it on the internet.My problem with this book is not the theme- we've all seen the concept of the innocent slipping into monsterhood, and the reality of people ignoring monsters among them for whatever reason. I am disturbed by my sense that the author takes a little too much voyeuristic pleasure in the details of the victims' sufferings( despite his protestations in the afterward that he himself had to draw the line and not reveal all the real Sylvia's torments).Stylistically the novel ends on a clumsy note, with contrived resolution to the conflict that is unsatisfying in it's contrivance (and nothing at all like the reality of the case).Don't bother."
4,Real life horror,"Good story, very emotional, overall a good read, but I felt Ketchum held back at certain key points of this book where he could have really floored his audiences. Who knows, maybe there will be an uncensored edition."
5,Fantastifc TV show,"This is a fantastic series. I have Seasons 1, 2 and 3 and can't wait for Season 4 to come so I can rent it. Please get it here soon."
1,Bad enough to motivate me to enter a review,"Poorly designed. The phone cannot be placed on the hook so it dangles there uselessly. The first time we opened the dishwasher, two tiny plastic fragments broke off and now we can't open and close the dishwasher without the door falling off entirely. I had to remove the batteries because the sounds were loud, irritating, and startling, even for an adult. This is too bad, since we have enjoyed other Loving Family pieces with lights and sound and it was a major reason for my hunting down this set (and paying way too much for it, I might add). What a disappointment."
4,Great Value,"I bought this GPS mostly for fun. Although the maps it ships with are not as detailed as I would like, I personally believe you get very nice features for the price."
2,Problems with these speakers. Stopped working,"I got these speakers with a Gateway system about 8 years ago years ago, and I liked them okay. Then about 4 yrs ago I found a pair of bigger speakers for only $10 at an estate sale, and they had better sound, so I began using them instead, and put the BA system in my closet. Well, this week, one of my 'newer' speakers crapped out.So I went back and my BA system out of the closet, set it up -- and nuthin. No sound. I checked and re-checked all of the hook-ups and outlets and power source, etc, and still no sound at all. Why would they just stop producing sound?Is it because they sat dormant for 4 years? That seems weird. Any suggestions on what the problem might be or if it is worth getting them ""repaired?""thanks"
1,Retauteur,"1 1/2Partially paralyzed, singer-songwriting indie pop is all self-absorbed yarn besides the few hummable choruses the don't breed catchy contempt."
5,My New Favorite!,"Skullcrusher Mountain is the best song I've heard lately. It is a folksy love song from an evil villain to his captured damsel in destress. What could be better than that?I dunno, maybe a pop-rock song about Mandlebrot and his fractals. These songs are such gems that it's very much worth it to buy the CD, even though there are only 5 songs."
4,Better Then The Others,"I've bought every Disney Mania that has been released. I really liked the first Disney Mania, but two, three, and four I was slightly dissapointed with. This one is arguably the best one. The only song I did not enjoy was the Second Star to the Right. My favorites were; Part of Your World, When She Loved Me, Colors of the Wind, Go the Distance, Reflection, and Let's Get Together."
3,Not so fresh anymore!,"After four previous volumes, Disney is starting to repeat itself! Despite such a fantastic and diverse songbook, I was disappointed to find so many of the songs on volume five have already been covered on the previous Disneymania albums. The series is a great concept, but it really has lost vision and umph with this latest release!"
5,a good cd,"what a great cd. One of the best disney mania of all time. I really love Jordan Pruit's version of ""When She Loved Me"" it is so good it fits with her voice. I also love the Cheetah Girls's version of ""So this Is love"" the spanish part sounds so beautiful. Vanessa hudgens didnt do her best with ""Colors of the Wind"" but she did all she can with that song. After all it is a hard song to sing trust me I sang it for my school quoir once and it was murder on my voice so good for you Vanessa you did a hard song.Ashley did a good job with ""Kiss The Girl"". The other songs sound good except ""Second star to the right"" by T-squad the kill the song. The other songs sound okay."
5,Lisa Kelly Sounds Like an Angel,"After hearing Lisa on the new Celtic Woman-A New Journey CD, I purchased this CD. It is one of my favorites. Her voice is so incredibly beautiful and spiritual. I listen to it all the time and have yet to tire of it. If you liked Celtic Woman, you will LOVE this CD."
5,Lisa,"This C/D is just what I wanted. It arrived quickly and in good condition. Anyone fond fo the ""Celtic Woman"" group will enjoy this music. Keep up the good sales Amazon. B"
3,rip off,"Paid for a B10B, received a BX. Works much better than the A10, but I could have saved $60 by buying it from another Amazon vendor."
4,A nolstagic look back into father/son 50's & 60's,"A fine book for any man to read who is a: beyond forty five years old, b: has sons, c: possibly was brought up Jewish. All or some of the above would enjoy this book. I am reminded of my own father, his triumphs and shortcomings and Calvin's book is a must for any person who wants a quick fun read with interesting messages. I started it, and finished it the same morning! I could not put it down..."
4,"Great to be back, but where's the music?","Well after a long hiatus, FUNimation is back at it. The voices are great as they ever were, only real difference is Eric Vale (voice of Sanji) seems to be giving Sanji a more raspy, and yet a little higher pitch performance with his character. It's not bad, but Sanji doesn't sound as smoooooth as Eric used to make him sound.All in all everything seems perfect. Only downside in my opinion is that FUNimation didn't dub the new opening and ending song like they have previously. For me, hearing they're English adaptations of the theme songs from One Piece was all part of the fun. They kept the songs in their original Japanese and unfortunately skipped one of the ending songs. But despite all that, this was a great purchase and it's great to have them back. Just hope they can dub the opening and ending songs in the future."
1,"A total disappointment, and a real chore to read","This was my first Deveraux book, and I must say I won't be reading any additional ones.As some other reviews have already noted, the plot and characters were totally unrealistic. The book was so unrealistic that it prevented me from being able to become involved in the story as a reader, or to identify in any way with the totally unbelievable characters.The other thing that bothered me the most was the poor quality of the writing: bad sentence construction abounded, and the writing was generally unimaginative and amateurish."
1,Will the real Jude Devereaux please return?!?!?!?,"This story was so sappy it made my teeth hurt! I wish the author who excited and charmed in stories like ""A Knight in Shining Armor"" would return. Has she been kidnapped by aliens? This plot would lead one to believe so. Totally unbelievable. The usual gullible helplass girl meets rich man who saves her. She's really even too stupid to notice. Oh, and of course it's every day that your Wall Street wonder would just breeze in and start changing diapers and loving your son. That's totally believable! This was the worst story line I've read in quite some time. The only reason I finished the book was to get a laugh and groan out of the characters and their dialogue. Don't waste your money or time."
4,Loved it!,"The characters in this book were so likeable, especially the baby Max. Amy is confused as to what she wants and is not willing to accept handouts from her rich man Jason. This is frustrating for Jason, so he devises schemes to give her what he thinks she needs.This is a feel good book all the way through. I just love Jude deveraux."
1,Wow...in a bad way,"I hate to add another review with only one star, but it has to be done. I was unpleasantly surprised by this book. The whole plot was totally unbelievable (millionaire agrees to babysit brother's love interest's kid?) and extremely weak. The style of writing also bothered me in that she had the characters reminiscing about what had just transpired instead of letting the reader feel that they were in on the story. Not to mention the huge time gaps, the underdevelopment of their romance, the unrealistic portrayal of a two year old, and the lies they kept telling each other after they had ""matured"" for two years. A wholly unsatisfying read that leaves me craving her classic work."
2,Out of all books I've read not one of her best detailed.,"I collect all Jude Deveraux books and recently purchased The Blessing. I find the book does not compare to the others, I admit I am more in love with the historical books written by Jude Deveraux but, I also enjoy the more recent time book An ANGEL FOR EMILY. True the book had a little fantasy to it but it captured your heart and you actually wished you had your own angel. I will still keep The Blessing because other wise my collection will not be comlete. I know Jude Deveraux will continue to draw me in with her many wonderful romances she has yet to write, and though The Blessing wasn't a favorite of mine, I'm sure it was to someone else. Keep up the wonderful job Jude Deveraux! I look forward to the next book you write. Sincerely, Your biggest fan Nicole A."
2,Not heart-stopping enough,This book is not one with her usual style of writing. There are not enough heart stopping moments and the male and female lead seem not to be the typical kind too. The female actually cries quite a lot and the guy is should i say rather blockhead and stiff though he seems to be handsome and rich. Not a bad book for a relaxing read but dont expect to get fired up and excited over the story much.
1,Don't Waste Your Time or Money,This book is so unrealistic and unbelievable that I didn't even finish it. I read 40 pages and that was enough.
4,Good video for novices as well as experienced players,"Score More! (1988) is a pretty good video to teach novice bowlers how to bowl properly, but can also benefit more experienced bowlers. I'm a self-taught bowler, but I can appreciate what Bo Burton was trying to accomplish with this video. However, I feel that Bo doesn't put enough emphasis on teaching from the ground up, such as the fundamentals like footwork, armswing, timing, etc. Probably the biggest thing that I agree with him on is when he recommends the semi-fingertip grip, a grip that very few people use. I happen to use a full fingertip grip, but I think the semi-fingertip grip is a grip that is a good balance between power and control. Probably the most famous bowler who uses a semi-fingertip grip is Marshall Holman. Bo Burton shows you how to practice at home, how to fix problems in your game, improving your strategy, the mental game, and how to practice smarter.Overall, it's a good video that I recommend."
4,Worth your Money!,"Nikon Coolpix camera is the way to go, if you don't want to spend a fortune on a camera. You can preview pictures, change settings, but the only thing I don't like about this camera is that it eats up batteries! Please consider getting a Battery Pack with it!"
5,great movie,my family loves this movie ! great Christmas gift ! movie came on time for Christmas gifts and everyone loved them
2,Definitely Catholic,It would be a great movie if you are Catholic but if not it can be confusing. I must have missed the part that said itis a Catholic movie.
5,"A movie for anyone who believes that there is ""something else"" after this life.",Simple yet wonderful movie. A must see for any Catholic! Ideal for Catholic children who have had their first reconciliation and first communion. A great piece for anyone who believes in God and has ever struggled between good and evil (Anyone?)
4,The Greatest Miracle,An awesome story! This movie has everything one needs to get on track spiritually to live a Catholic based life! Great insight to our religion !!! Blessed by this great movie! The only reason I did not rate it 5 stars were the graphics.
4,Good book,Very good book that explained puberty in a christian manner. My husband and I thought it was a lil too much right now for our 11 year old. So we will wait till he is 13. Good book overall though.
1,Not for my family..,This series of books was too much too soon for my kids. I have since found something better...Mother's Little Helper and Listen Son.
3,"good songs , bad recordings","Rehash of now familiar material in demo versions and extremely poor recordings.Pretty much every song on here was featured on ""For The Punx"" and ""Underground Army"" and they sound terrible. Worst example is ""Punk Rock Love"" which is a slower , and muffled noise with the sound fading in and out. However on here is some unreleased great songs ""Drinking Is Our Way Of Life"" , ""Bored & Glued"" , ""40 Ounce Casualty"" , ""25 Years Too Late"" , ""No Life"" that are not featured on any other studio release. If you can tolerate 10th rate recording than get it , but if you prefer better versions on the other studio albums than avoid it"
2,stopped unexpectly,This product looked great and has a great name but after a few uses it would never start not sure what happened .Use with care when using ethanol added gas .That may be the reason it quit I have heard that ethanol doesn't mix and can cause problems.
3,Not a compilation; but not really an original either,"I have been a Patti Austin fan for 25 years, and I own 16 original Patti Austin albums, plus 5 compilation packages. ""Jukebox Dreams"" is basically a reworking of Patti's album, ""In and Out of Love."" Of the 11 songs featured on ""Jukebox Dreams,"" eight of them can also be found on ""In and Out of Love."" ""Got To Give It Up,"" ""I Musta Been Dreamin,"" and ""Kiss"" are the three songs unique to ""Jukebox Dreams."" Paying $32.00 for three songs is a bit steep, but as a Patti Austin fan, I am glad it is part of my collection. For the non-fan, save your money and get ""In and Out of Love."""
2,Perfume,"This is a beautiful scent. Strong, so you only need a splash of it in the air. It is flowefully gorgeous. the bottle is so beautiful, you can use it as a decor on your dresser. Nice!!"
1,A very bad game.,"The game has the worst graphics ever, and in my opinion, Super Mario on Super Nintendo is better then this game! Please take my advice, please don't waste your money on this game. I can see that Eidos Interactive didn't spend much time on thinking what other gamers want, a game with good graphics, good gameplay, realistic gameplay and being able to actually kill an enemy."
4,I give 4 and 1/2 stars to a great first person shooter RPG,"I have had more fun playing this game than any other since the Quake series!You play J.C. Denton a nano technology augmented government agent in a not too distant future.The game can be played in three different character ""modes"" making it possible to play it three times with 3 different endings!You can play as a ""Hacker"" a ""Stealth"" player or a combat ""soldier"" or a blend of all.It all depends on the augmentations you choose as you play along. Be sure your computer meets the system requirements,because the graphics are awesome and the sound is excellent especially if you have a soundblaster live card.I own over 50 PC games and this one's right up there at the top.It's a keeper."
3,Does he give a solution?,"I read the author's introduction to the book and, besides sounding like a rant, it was bullseye.However, is the entire book just a long lament on how sad we've become, or does he offer a remedy? (The logical conclusion being: stop voting for politicians)Thanks,D.G."
1,Smart or stupid?,"""Simply because there have not been Albanian-style mass violent attacks on government office buildings?""Lines from the introduction of this bookSince when have violent attacks on government office buildings become an Albanian thing?Please leave Albania out of your stupid mass produced books"
4,A cartoon to make you weep! Maybe.....,"When I was a child, I cried when the whale died. Now, I think the cartoon is pretty silly (especially since the words to the operatic melodies have been changed). It seems to me that the writer was pulling his audience's leg! Loved seeing it again, along with Ferdinand and Lambert."
3,Not worth the price,I thought that this product would do wonders I guess. Not really anything special that I couldn't have found at Walmart Or Target for 1/10th of the price.
5,Only in New Hampshire: Direct and Insightful,"Though a political novice myself, I thoroughly enjoyed this insightful look into the campaign process. The author's direct and matter-of-fact approach to the highs and lows of working behind the scenes on the presidential campaign trail was refreshing and engaging from the start. I highly recommend Only in New Hampshire!"
4,For the brokenhearted,"I recently went through a traumatic breakup and was wading between feeling sorry for myself, and viewing it as a way to improve upon myself. I've taken a positive outlook but once that familiar demon of loneliness sets in it often leads to trouble. Cooper's book not only helped me to maintain my positive perspective, but the stories of these woman, in the language of my family and my ancestors, helped me to heal and forgive myself. There is a theme that runs through each gem of a story that says ""No matter how bad things get you have to keep moving, keep trying, keep loving."" These stories give me hope and keep me company, and they teach lessons of love that only experience and wisdom can tell. This is the first book of Cooper's that I have read and anyone that is revered by Alice Walker and Ntozake Shange was worth a look. I am officially a fan."
4,Good overview of Scots-Irish migration through the south,"This book provides some interesting history and a good description of what life was like on the early American frontiers, including where they settled, how they traveled, hardships encountered, and why many continued to migrate, in particular, to the south. I always wondered why every generation would migrate on to the next place, and this book gave some helpful answers and explanations as to why they continued to move on. The author concentrates on two particular routes; one going westward to settlements in Kentucky and eastern Tennessee, and the other going south through Virginia and the Carolinas. While I was able to find some ancestors in the lists provided, I found it more interesting to learn how they lived and what events led them to certain places. It's a good place to start to get the background and history on the movements of Scots-Irish settlers going south."
4,Great overview of British Horror films,"This book is a great overview of British Horror films. I have found several films that I now need to try and find on DVD or video that I had either not thought about in decades or had never heard of (The Ghoul, Horrors of the Black Museum, The Earth Dies Screaming, et al.) The writing is well done and the author does a fine job of covering a ton of films in too little space. I own several books from the film series by Creation Books and this title is one of my favorites."
4,Patti's Words of Wisdom,"Patti's Pearls was a inspirational read for me. She sharedsome lessons of wisdom which was passed on to her.It was as if you were having a sister girl conversation and she was and did tell it like it is as she sees it .So much truth to the words of wisdom and great lessons to think about.I highly recommend Patti's Pearl for a fast and inspirational read. Who knows you might even learn something from her book of life. I sure did.You might understand some things in your life. Patti, 4.5* for sharing your words of wisdom ."
1,"Do not buy, it breaks!!!","I was totally annoyed by its low quality. It broke the first time I carried outdoors for picture shooting. One plastic hood was breaking into pieces when I tried to strench one of its legs, so now it turned into a piece of crap."
1,Disintegrated on first use!,No joke . . . this tripod totally fell apart the first time I used it! An absolutely piece of junk! Avoid!
5,Excellent overview,This is a good book for both practitioners and academics. Full coverage of many topics.
5,Loved it!,I played this game for three months straight! Casual x fans and long trerm alike would love this game. i beat it like 8 times before it began to get old.
1,Same addresses listed over and over again,I searched all over for this book. It was even recommended through a business brief published by Business Reference Services Humanities and Social Sciences Division Library of Congress in 1994. So you could only imagine my dissappointment when I realized this book simply lists a bunch of addresses over and over again and gives you almost nothing to go on. I got much more out of a 35 page booklet entitled Your Guide To Free Government Grants than I did from this over 350 page book. I truly felt dissapointed and would not recommend this book to anyone searching for a grant.
1,Disappointing,"I was very excited when I first learned of the book, but was disppointed after purchasing it.The language in it was much like the government non-functional language. I could have gotten the same information going to the government on-line site.I was hoping that finally an author was putting things in the layman's terms.I was looking for a government grant for a minority woman to receive in opening an aquarium business. I didn't know I would need an attorney or professor to decifer what each grant pertained to.Very disappointing. I'm just your everyday, average person (much like the main populous) who cannot decifer government mumbo-jumbo language."
4,"Ribald Sci-Fi, or Fantasy","Lavatorial and funny. I read this in the 70s and recall it fondly. Its the side of the little folk that somehow gets left out of the 'serious' fantasy literature. It maybe explains why there aren't any fairy folk left; they didn't fade from our sight, we thought it better to ignore them\ and their deviant ways <g>. Serious Sci readers will probably shun the book - did shun the book, it's ages old - but might be loved by the irreverent. Also try Bored of the Rings."
1,car charger,i received my car charger and it has never worked. i've tried changing the fuse but to no avail. what a disappointment
4,Great Big Sound at a Good Price,"These are well designed multimedia speakers that sound great. There is a lot here for its price: it has digital and analog inputs and outputs, and punchy satellite speakers with an ample sub-woofer. My only complaint is the absence of a balance control on the satellite, along with the volume and tone knobs."
3,Not Closed Captioned,----- at this time.Which leaves many people under-represented.Hence the 3 star rating. If and when it becomes closed captioned I hope to be able to increase my rating.This is not a petty complaint. It's a 'complaint' for all hard of hearing or deaf people who are left 'out of the loop' simply because of no closed captioning.
2,not as great as the other reviewers stated,"This case is an okay choice as far as quality goes. I have a large Sephora train case that is higher quality than this one. It is worth paying an extra $30.00 for the Sephora case and get a case with better quality. I don't believe this case has a swivel handle as advertised, if it does than the one I got doesn't work. In addition, the trays in the top are plastic(not the greatest quality plastic either) with a flimsy metal type attachment that lifts the trays. The dividers, in the lower trays and compartments, are hard to adjust. There is a lot of room in the bottom compartment but it is hard to get to because of the way the trays are constructed. This is a gift for a person who does not have one at all so I think it will do, but if I was buying it for me I would return it. I did get delivery really fast, that's a plus."
1,"very shabby, poor construction","I found this item to be very poorly constructed, the lining inside the compartments was not fitted properly, the metal parts were affixed loosely and it was basically a piece of crap. I sent it back the same day it was delivered."
3,Not worth the money,Received case and was disappointed. The inside trays are lined with foam which wasn't stuck to the trays properly and the foam on the dividers are not even sticky enough in order for them to stay down.
2,Poor workmanship,I am a little disappointed in the case. The glue is showing. The felt is peeling. TheDividers are awful and cheaply made. The aluminum is scratched. The advert said it was worth $80. BULL! Where is the strap and keys. If you have never had a train case before you will like it. Not love it. It is however a very large box. Just poorly constructed in my opinion. Where are my bottom dividers. It okay. I will not purchase another.
4,Really Practical,"I really needed a place to put and organize all of my makeup. This case is surprisingly big which I love that about it. To give some prospective, it took up half the space of my small rolling luggage. The top compartments are adjustable. You just lift a dividing slot and move it to create more/less space. However, you can only really adjust the top level. Because the case only opens up as much as shown in the pictures, the second level is still slightly covered by the first level making it hard to remove the slots (which I still haven't figured out how). The bottom compartments are not adjustable, but they are very deep and I stack my eye-shadows and foundation bottles there. It's not an indestructible case, so don't abuse it, but it's quite sturdy and I have everything I need to get ready in there. I highly recommend this product!"
5,Depends on who you order it from!,"This case is great if you get the right one! I ordered two within a couple weeks of each other, so they were shipped from different companies. The one from Yazmo is great, inside and out, and looks just like the one pictured. The reason there are so many mixed reviews on this is that some people are receiving one that has foam lined trays inside. The quality is horrible! It was falling apart on arrival and the trays are not sturdy at all. If you decide to order, good luck! I hope you get the good one!"
4,Train case,"Today i received my train case i bought this for my husband he has gotten into sfx make up and i thought this would be a great starter case at a first glance i noticed right away that this case is far from being 24"" in! Its about 18 not that big of a deal but like another reviewer stated that should probably be fixed in the description but other than that im pleased with my purchase"
2,Dont get my hopes too high.,"I've been looking for a makeup train case for quite some time now, and i've been looking toward to the Sephora. But I guess you pay what you get. I came across this deal on amazon and i thought I came across a perfect deal. However, once i received my package... i was not as pleased as i hope i will be. The case was dirty at few area. the box that the product was delivered in looks like it was a return item. it was clearly that someone else before me opened the box. Also, the train case doors does not stay close unless it is lock. and the interior are poorly made, the interior are glued on and it can be ripped easily. pay for a highly price product sure makes a different!!!"
5,Very beautiful!,"This book is a very bittersweet story about a girl named Caitlin who is very easy for me to identify with. She is there to please people, and never wants others to think she is unfriendly or mean. Not that that's a bad thing, but it gets her into a few situations that she could have otherwise avoided. The book has a good point, and might even make you cry! It is written very poetically, and says things that you realize you have wondered all your life, but never thought anyone else actually wondered about it! It is slightly slow paced, but in the end, very good!"
3,Wrong market,"If I wanted a console game I would have a console instead of a PC. This game based it's interface on console style games and suffers for it. If you're coming from console gaming and are new to the PC game market this would be a good crossover game for you. If you're a PC gamer, however, this will provide an entertaining game that you will often get very frustrated with."
5,Plastilina Mosh - Juan Manuel,"Este disco es una excelente muestra de lo que puede convertirse el kitsch a nivel musical. A través de una variedad de ritmos (latino, disco, hip hop, dance, incluso medio rockero), logran conformar un conjunto de obras que podrían estar al borde del mal gusto pero que, en sus manos, se convierten en excelentes canciones, con una gran producción, delicadeza, y sentido estético. Para hacerlo se basan en diversos instrumentos: sampler, teclados antiguos, guitarras distorsionadas, scratch, baterías programadas, y ocupan muchas veces voces rapeadas o vocoder para enuncar textos completamente absurdos. Por eso mismo, siempre da la impresión de que estuvieran realizando una parodia de la música que han escuchado toda su vida. Pero esto no le quita calidad a lo que hacen sino que, al contrario le da una nueva dimensión, una profundidad adicional."
4,"SOME PROBLEMS, BUT STILL . . .","It seems to me that this CD doesn't have the passion, freshness, and memorable cuts that others have. No major gems here. Having said that, It's still worth buying and listening to. They're just that good. By the way, bringing Derek back was not necessarily what they needed. He's gone off in another direction (a good one, though) and does not seem to be in the groove with the rest of the group. I love Caedmons and was hoping for an in the park home run, but got at best a triple. Granted, though, a triple for Caedmons would be a grand slam for other Christian folk-rock groups!"
4,A welcome return!,"Ahhh, Caedmon's Call. I still love to pop in their self-titled album (still one of my top ten Christian albums of all time) and My Calm/Your Storm into my CD player. ""40 Acres"" and ""Long Line of Leavers"" were okay and then I stopped listening to Caedmon's. And of course, I got into Derek Webb and loved his first album (and liked his next 2 as well as loved Sandra's hymns album). So I was very excited when I heard of the return of Caedmon's Call with Derek Webb back and singing and songwriting (and Sandra songwriting as well). I had high expectations, and although this album still can't compare with the early Caedmon's, what we get is great musicianship and melodies. ""Hold The Light"" and ""Trouble"" are probably my favorites at the moment, but I still miss those fantastic Aaron Tate songs of the past. With all that said, this is a solid album that will get repeated listens."
4,Good stuff !,"Not the best from Caedmon's call, but fans will like it. Definitely worth the cost. Very enjoyable."
3,Okay for a Season,"I've used this for quite a while now. Yes, it does keep the heat away from you, but it has warped quite badly and the rubber bumpers have been a problem all along. They don't stay stuck to the mat and at this point, I've lost two of them altogether. It's time for a new lap desk."
4,Works well,"This particular one is too small for using a mouse, so you might want the next bigger one."
3,lapinator,bought too long ago to rember this item I never got this survey until 1/15/2013. I cant remember this product
1,Don't just walk away- RUN!!!,"Awful, just awful. Idiotic scripts. Incredibly bad acting.Where can I go to get my money back? And the time wasted?"
1,A waste of time,"Gimmicky and sometimes downright annoying. I was really looking forward to having a new author to read, after Harlan Ellison spoke so highly of di Filippo, but no such luck! I'm a big fan of William Gibson and Neal Stephenson, so I really expected to like this book, but I couldn't make myself finish it."
1,Bad quality,"I love this show and have been waiting patiently for season 7. I was thrilled that after 3 years of waiting, it was finally going to be released. I can't stand SONY any more, because of their refusal to release so many of the classic TV shows that they keep in their vault, so I was happy to hear that SHOUT was taking over production. Unfortunately, they did a terrible job of transferring the episodes to DVD. The movements of every scene are a little bit jerky and awkward, the picture is grainy and there are horizontal lines throughout the entire picture. Don't get me wrong, it's still a better quality than you can get by watching AITF on TVLAND, and it seems as if the episodes are unedited, but the quality is still extremely dissappointing. If you love All in the Family, then you are still going to want to buy this collection, but be forewarned that seasons 1-6 were of much better quality."
4,I agree with the others,"I agree with those who have expressed dissatisfaction with the longggggwait in between seasons of this, the best sit-com of all time.It's bad enough there are NO special features on any of the sets, not all of them even have subtitles.It seems like every other show has been fully released, every season included.They don't even put much thought into the sets at all, so I don't see what the holdup is. It seems like an eternity ago that the first season was released, we're only up to six now, and every single season of Seinfeld and every other important show is complely available.Hurry UP!"
3,Disappointed,"A small cutting board that's in the picture of this product did not arrive and the packaging was such that when you opened the item everything fell out. It's a wonder that the mustards didn't break!Wild Game Pack (Venison, Elk, Buffalo) - Wisconsin Cheeseman"
2,"If you know anything about marketing at all, this book will NOT help you.","This book may be great if you are a first time author and know nothing about book marketing, but it's basically a collection of emails (with many type-o's) put into book format. No index, much repeated information. If you work in marketing, it's not going to be useful."
4,Third Phase...,"Yea, i really like this cd... i think the album wuz good... the best are ""chameleon"" ""not like her"" & ""boy u gotta go"" Halie has the best voice... and they're from Orlando, Florida - in which, i love that place... so the girls did a good job with this one.. sure, they haven't been on the scene since but that's probably because Edel Entertainment was nixed.. Either way, i enjoy this and ""Dance"" is a great club-banger! I wanna thank BDMAENTERTAINMENT for sending me this disc..."
5,Perfect.,Everything is just as listed. Got to my house quick and so far the cartridges have worked perfectly. Definitely will order again from here.
4,A Good Beginning,"This book is mostly for the novice. If you are looking for more advanced, inspirational, and creative illustrations; this book is not for you-look elsewhere. The author gave a broad coverage of basic Chinese brushwork, supplies, and techniques. The illustrations are very straight forward, colorful, and easy to follow. The supplies that come with the book are really good and the cost for the total package is a great price. If you are looking to get your feet wet in Chinese Brush art-this is an excellent start."
3,DicaPac WP100 Small 145 X 95mm Waterproof Cases,"I was going on a trip and was going to do some diving, this bag looks like it will work, and I'm sure it does, but after trying it on the camera, figured I'd just get the hard case, I still think this bag works great if taking it to a out door funtion and think it's going to rain, or a locker room championship celebration to keep the champagne off the camera this is what you will need,"
1,DiCAPac WP-100 - Marine case,"I bought this couple week ago for my Canon SD1000. This DiCAPac WP-100 - Marine case can't be used for SD1000. Very hard to put the camera in or to take it out. I have not tried underwater yet. However, I went kayaking 2 weeks ago and took some pictures with the DiCAPac WP-100 case and knew that part of the camera flash was covered by the black plastic that cover the lense. Don't know what to do with this DiCAPac WP-100 now!"
1,Shameless!,Looking reasonably usable on the picture but completely unusable for anything thicker than a sheet of paper. No surprise that the only thing they guarantee is... that it will keep a small piece of paper dry ONCE!Your camera will be flooded almost immediately.
4,I am bolivian,"I just want to say that this book actually shows the reality of my country, multiethnic and pluricultural."
4,Good Acount of events,Professor Wrone really has written a great book. Unlike so many other books he doesn't present any wild theories about film tampering. This is a great read for anybody that is interested in the case and tired of all the lies that are told by other writers on the subject.
4,Well worth reading,"This book is a must read. Indeed there's lot to be said about the more natural approach as opposed to traditional medical methods. I don't have Cancer but like most people I know a lot of people who have died from it. But I also know several survivors that the medical profession 'wrote off'. They are all alive today and all followed a program very similar to the ones mentioned in this book. The book is important to read even if you don't have Cancer. Prevention as they say is better than cure. I don't care what anyone says, I believe and have proven that diet and working with the subconcious mind really does work."
5,A great CD!,"I know some have not given this CD a great review, but I on the other hand, happen to love this CD! In our small town we have a coffee shop where we have many amateur musicians who play every night. This music reminds me of sitting there, drinking a cup of hot coffee, and listening to the good live music. I appreciate and like the blend between the jazz and the celtic. I think the musicians have done a great job and no doubt they had a great time putting this CD together. Two thumbs up!!!"
4,Pretty good book,Excellent book really enjoyed it great story if only it would happen in real life not just in the books
3,Problem unit,I purchased this unit and at first it worked great but about a week later the DVD player stopped working.It would not read the discs and I had to send it in for repair.I am still waiting for the return of this unit.Hopefully it will be o.k.
2,Lots of potential . . . ultimately doesn't deliver,"The Potential1. Great input/output options (svhs, rca,firewire . . .).2. DVD recording from whatever source the unit can take.The Let Down1. Cumbersome procedures for VHS => DVD recordings.2. Fussy firewire input.4. Disk Error on most discs after 5 months of owning the unit.5. HORRENDOUS customer service/support."
1,This movie stinks,"Don't waste your money unless you enjoy movies in the ""So-Bad-It's-Good"" category. Actually, this doesn't even make into that sad club. If you really support independent productions and have enough liquid capital that you can throw fifteen bucks or so into the toilet and flush it away without a second thought, by all means buy a copy. If not, however, don't bother pulling your wallet out."
4,My opinion about Ridley Evolution,A great book for Evolution topics. It can be read easily and has good and clear information.
4,A warning about the DVD subtitles,"I loved the film, but a word of warning about the english subtitles. The translation is very strange in parts - substitution of completely wrong words with a similar spelling. Also the subtitles linger only just long enough for you to be able to read them if you happen to be looking at the bottom of the screen waiting in anticipation."
4,Very cool movie,"I can wholeheartedly recommend this movie. Action fans won't be disappointed, and it has a solid plot to boot. I have now seen 3 movies by Johnny To, and they all have a little *twist* in the plot. That makes them more interesting and they definitely stand out from run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-ups."
3,Good pictures,"it is ok.. really did not get into the reading of the book. The pictures were great gave me some great ideas for my forensic Science class that I teach.The story, honestly I did not read. Did not interest me... it is written like a crime novel as the lead Dect. voice."
5,loads of fun,6 year-old to 60's plus sang and danced for hours....great fun for all...looking forward to another purchase for next Christmas Eve get together!!!
2,didn't work on our karaoke machine,"For some reason, this disc didn't work on our karaoke machine ---- not sure why but we've had some trouble with this brand before so am going to steer clear in the future. Not to say, however, that it wouldn't work on another machine."
1,She's a fake and a hack.,"""Fat makes you fat, and that is that."" No, it's not Susan. This ""plan"" is foolish and a rip-off. Powter claims that if you only eat foods that contain less than 15% fat, you can eat ALL you want and expect to lose weight. She claims she and her children eat ""bucketloads of popcorn"" because it is low-fat. I find Powter to be a woman on a mission to piss off. The modern day version of her, is bitter, angry, and maladjusted to a world that has left her femi-nazi style far behind. I find the teachings of Geneen Roth to be much more helpful to women and men for that matter. Leave this book alone, and find a healthy, balanced, and SANE way to look at life and the place you take in this world."
2,Just another CD,Well just now what is our music turning into. We have so many new bands and albums coming out each and every day. This is just another CD from just another young adult. I mean we are just trying to make more money and market to the youth of our nation. I mean we are no longer making CDs that will really last. Someone off of the street could just walk into a recording studio pretty much these days and make a CD. We just need to stop this. All it is is for our children. They want it so we have to but it for them.
1,MD,I did not get the CD yet and I am not going to I liked Vanessa on HSM but I did not like the songs.She should had got some help from Ashley Tisdale because her CD was great and she can sing.So if I was vanessa I would take singing class.
5,BEST DEBUT ALBUM!!!,"All the tracks on this album is hot!!!.I give it 5 stars cause,I mean Vannessa really came out from High Scool Musical to making it big,with at least more than 7 hits on this album, And plus with the hits ""Say OK"", ""Come Back to me"", ""Lose your Love"" and many more, you gotta love it. I recommend this for anybody who wants to hear the best hits of the year."
5,"""V""'s Review","Vanessa Hudgens' new soundtrack will be sure to please the whole family.Unlike many other soundtracks,her's has a messege in every single song.Some songs make you feel so alive and make you want to dance forever,and some make you fell like staying home and just relaxing.The point is,if you haven't already,you have to get her CD!!"
4,Pretty nice!,"I bought these boots for riding my motorcycle. They look great and work great. My jeans don't fold up while riding fast. They seem pretty durable and I'm sure they would last a good year or so if I wore them for work(factory). The only issue I have with them is that the laft boot fits perfect, while the right one is snug at the top of my foot/bottom of ankle. Seems like it's loosening up the more I wear it. Makes my foot go numb while I'm just sitting. I have high hope for these boots, wearing the to Sturgis this year...lots of walking and riding!!! Will update when we get back."
5,Lash adhesive that works!,"This stuff works! I used this on my wedding day. It was outdoors with temps in the mid-80's. With guests and a professional photographer, I REALLY didn't want to be messing with ""hanging"" eyelashes. My lashes stayed secure for a full nine hours until I removed them. Prior to my wedding, I'd tested other adhesives that failed. Andrea Lash Adhesive didn't fail me when I tested it out or on my wedding day. I am 40 years old and was worried about getting an adhesive that would both stick and also not irritate my sensitive lids. This is it!"
1,Extremely Unagile,"I am really at a loss to find any kind of purpose and utility for this book. The writing style and presentation format are extremely boring, wordy , convoluted and formal while the diagrams and technical parts are loose, confused and presented with abundant hand waving. It' s the just the opposite of what an ""agile book"" should be: concise, fun, attention-catching presentation style and abundant, precise and clear cut technical detail. Reading this painful tome will just force you to digest a pretty heavy load of fluff while learning very little design or modeling skills of any value. It's really ironic how a book written on Agile Development can end up so boring, heavy, awkward, messy and randomly put together...to sum it up: extremely unagile. Good advice for the agile developer: start by throwing this useless waste of paper in the toilet where it belongs. You will feel much lighter."
3,"Okay, but kind of cumbersome","First of all, I must say that this is an excellent book to get detailed information when you are in a bind in the OR. But the problem I have with this book is that it is sort of in a no-man's-land of materials. If I need the nitty-gritty on a subject, I go to Barash or Miller, but in the OR, I only need to get to the stuff I seem to have forgotten, so I go to Ezekiel. Mass General falls somewhere between too much information for the OR, and not enough information for home use. I've also found it rather difficult at times to find things with the small, cramped print. (Not to mention that it doesn't fit as easily as Ezekiel in the back pocket of your scrubs)Undeniably, this is a good book with a wealth of information, but I don't understand why people rely on it so heavily."
5,Great CD,This a great CD. Truley a family one. We all watch the TV show as a family and all like the songs on the CD. My four year old son listens to it as much as my seven year old daughter for whom the CD was purchased. Great CD
3,hannah montana,"my kids enjoy the i carly cd over the hanna montana, they like to hear the title song and some of the songs presented in the show, but not to crazy about the other tracks..."
2,Bought as a gift for boss's son & too weird to give it,"I bought this as a gift for my boss's son. I got the book in the mail and it was just weird when I read it. It's appropriate if YOU are a fireman trying to explain your job to your kid, but otherwise just too detailed for kids (i.e., it focuses on the times of Frank's appointments in the day, his relationships with others in the community, etc. It is more like a day-in-the-life-of book -- an Oprah show with cool pics. I have a boat load of kiddos in my family, and I can't imagine kids liking this. I'll probably give it to Goodwill. Certainly did not want my boss thinking that I thought that would be a good book for any kid."
4,Good Product,"Product works as expected, delivery was good. Used the software you can download from Avermedia, and that didn't work for beans, but I mainly got it for Media Center, so it wasn't an issue. Just wanted to try it out."
1,"Uh, remember the last Indiana Jones Movie?","It's been thirty years since I read the stories of Fahfrd and The Grey Mouser, but I recently rediscovered them and decided to enjoy it all over again. The first six books were as fun as I (vaguely) remembered them, real page turners. The 7th, however, (Knight and Knave, which wasn't part of the series in the early 1980s)was just unnecessary, if not garbage. I had to force myself to finish reading this book. The words Boring, Vulgar, Obscene, and waste of time come to mind. I feel the characters were seriously screwed over by seemingly careless writing in this book---and will consider the 6th book the last worth reading, and the only proper finale to an otherwise great series."
1,You do not get what's in the photo!,"I received a USB cable. Not what is in the photograph, which shows a SCSI/USB cable. I am not returning the item because I will not pay a restocking fee on something that I did not order to begin with. I will not buy anything from this company again."
4,Great Value,"I purchased this and found it extremely easy to install and understand. The set up was simple and easy to follow. The only downfall is that is doesn't work well for 5.1 channel output into a 5.1 channel receiver. I didn't need it to do that but if you do, look for another model that offers that output option.If you are looking for a great valued DVD player that has all the basics with no fuss, no muss...then this is the DVD player for you.PROS: Easy to install, operate with a low profile/footprint for your entertainment centerCONS: No individual 5.1 channel output for surround sound receivers."
1,Very disappointing,I bought this DVD player after getting a less expensive one that caused me several problems. I figured since it was a Sony I would have no problems at all. Not true! This player is EXTREMELY sensitive and I have problems with several DVDs. My friends with cheaper players have no problems playing the same disks. I am very disappointed and will not be buying Sony again.
3,dvd,the product arrived within the time it was said it would arrive. It does not read everything well and at times i have to unplug the device to get to to respond (reset).
1,Frequently freezes on rental disks!,"I steered away from the Consumer Reports'-recommended Panasonic DVD player when I saw customer reviews about the player freezing during playback. This Sony player, which is rated highly by CR, started freeze-framing on rental disks just 30 days after I bought it. Sony won't replace it unless it freezes with all disks. We rent a lot, and have never had any of our past 6 DVD players freeze like this, so it must be more sensitive to media scratches."
1,Bad Experience with 2 Sony DVD Players,"I used to have a lot of respect for Sony. Thinking, because I own several Sony devices, they manufactured quality products. Well, the experience I have had with my CD/DVD 'DVP-NS5OP' and 'DVP-NS575P' freezing and not allowing me to watch my movies has caused me to totally change my mind. I keep getting an error 'Cannot play...' I have given up on Sony and will definitely purchase a different brand in the future."
4,Great light but too expensive,"I got this light for my 25 lb. dog and it works great. It has an easy clasp that I can snap on and off him with one hand and it's not too heavy for him. I can also angle the light to make it shine straight ahead or the ground in front of him. I angle it down because others have said the light is really bright! Batteries are not included (it takes 2 AAA) and at $20 it's a little too expensive. High quality flashlights and bike lights with halogen are similarly priced and this doesn't even have different settings (blinking, etc), it's just on or off. Also, the plastic backing has a cheap feel and is not waterproof like other lights in this price range. Otherwise, a very nice light."
5,GREAT PRODUCT,Best product I have ever bought for my dog. I`m amazed how bright it is. It lights up signs [50] yards out. Cars avoid us when we walk in a rural area without sidewalks and street lights. It`s cheap to operate using AAA batteries unlike other lights. It`s durable. I`ve had it for [4] years. My dog likes it and it obviously keeps him safe. I would highly recommend it for anyone that walks their dog at night.Jerry
5,Dog light,"See my review for the red puplight. They are great, light in weight, and very bright. Best I've found!"
3,Either slow or fast???/,"I purchased these hoping to use them to add some rice cereal to my 4 month old daughter's bottles. However, she cannot really figure out how to use them. It seems like she sucks and sucks and nothing comes out so she gets frustrated. If I pull it out of her mouth slightly when she sucks on it the opening comes open way too far and chokes her. I am sure these probably work well for some kiddos but not mine. I started feeding her the rice cereal with a spoon and that is working much better so I won't even be using these. For me they were a waste of money."
4,"Good re-intro for ex-students, light on classical genetics","A reasonably good introduction to the subject for someone who has not done it, or is re-learning it after a long lay-off.Tends to be more biased towards the molecular level of genetics, which is probably due to the advances in this area in the 20 years since I did it.Does not tackle Classical or Population genetics in any depth.Nevertheless, a good book to get you re-interested in learning the subject of genetics again, and learning newer technologies.However, you will need to move onto bigger and better books very soon."
2,sucked,"My wife and I are going to Fantasy Fest with friends this year. I bought this movie so my wife and I could watch and sort of see what goes on. WAY TOO MUCH time is spent on Traci Bingham instead of documenting the fun. At $25.00, I spent about $22.00 too much. I purchesed the other FF movies from another source for about $3.50 each and they were great. Don't waste your money on this loser."
5,Perfect for a diagnosis and treatment,"This book is perfect for orthodontic's students , and of course, like guide, where you can find a support for your daily practice. Also you can see other book like Dentofacial Orthopedics With Functional Appliances, the same author."
2,Thumbs down,"What a disappointment! The book is full of inaccuracies--the author and publisher should have been much more careful with research and spellings. Bookstore owner was surprised only one biography is out so far, and this is what is offered! A few nice photos, but any reader could get Clay's story (and accurately at that) in a magazine article."
2,A Disappointment,"I am totally shocked that a book with so many grammatical errors, spelling errors, not to mention factual errors got past the editor.While I found the book interesting because of the subject matter, it was lacking in quality of information. It was obvious this book was thrown together in just a few days rather than researching with interviews, writing, editing, and then publishing. To put in large print just to be able to make it to 32 pages made it a read that could be done in minutes.Only worth the money if you want anything that says Clay Aiken. I am a die-hard fan of Clay's but I'll stick to ""real"" material hereafter."
3,"Creativity, academic style, mixed results","I have been a student of creativity for quite some time, so I ordered these books with very high hopes of it bringing together emerging thought from the enormous variety of work on the subject (admittedly, a very lofty task)...I found, however, that the presentation of the book was very flat, especially considering the nature of this exciting and dynamic field (THIS IS CREATIVITY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT, USE IT! ). Articles are presented in traditional academic style, mostly by (and consequently for) academics, with no evident interweaving of common themes or archetypes, betraying the essence of any holistic treatment of the subject... Many, including C.G. Jung, say that creativity develops from the generative interplay between intuition, the senses, feeling and thinking functions. The irony is that the presentation of this book captures one or two of these functions at best."
1,stopped baking,"I bought this product for its extra large capacity so I could use it for extra oven space when necessary as well as almost daily toasting. It takes very long to toast for the initial cycle, and I need to rotate the bread in order to ensure even toasting. The oven actually quit working altogether less than one year after purchase, and that was with fairly infrequent use of that feature. I am now stuck with a fairly large, inadequate toaster. After doing some research and finding poor performance reviews, I will not be purchasing a Black & Decker toaster oven again."
4,A Fun Read,"Very entertaining from beginning to end. If you like watching No Reservations and appreciate Anthony Bourdain's humor, you'll enjoy this book. It's a quick read and it'll make you chuckle throughout!"
4,"Want to be a chef, think again.","Anthony warns you, this is a book for chefs. But it's also a book for anyone interested in what its like to be a chef in resturants large and small. And, everything inbetween. He is totally irreverent and not ashamed about it. His take about celebrity chefs and well, being a celebrity at all, is interesting to say the least. He is not a fan. Being a chef is hard work. Being a sucessful chef is even more dificult. Want to change careers at say 40 or 50 to open your dream resturant. Think again. Most likely you'll fail.If you like his TV show you'll like the book."
3,Mildly entertaining,"Although there were interesting anecdotes, the book was mostly fluff. I was hoping it would get more interesting, but it didn't. This book is good if you are thinking about becoming a chef or want to know more about the industry, but there is no real point to the book."
4,Helped me to understand the business,"My son was thinking to become a chef not knowing what he will face but after reading the book, he decided not to become one. The book really helped him to see the reality of the business and it wasn't for him. I thank for this book otherwise I would spend a lot of money for his carrier for nothing. Thank you!"
5,GO GET THIS BOOK!!!,this book is so great. I am a high school student and I plan to go to culinary school after and this book is showing me what i am getting into. I am writing a book report for this book as I write this. I really hope the teacher doenst read this book!
4,"No Discount Sushi for Me, Thank You","Anthony Boudrain's account of his life in a restraunt kitchen is not for the faint of heart. Squeamish diners may want to avoid this book and continue to dine in ignorant bliss. For the rest of us this hilarious book provides a candid look behind the kitchen door, warts, ...er...rats, and all.Sex, drugs, and profanity abound in Boudrain's world, but before taking offense the reader should remember the author's only promise was to tell the truth about about his experiences in the restaurant business. Anyone seeking a glorified account of life as a chef will be disappointed. This is not your Food Channel version; this is the real thing. I doubt that anyone who reads this book will be able to experience restaurant dining in quite the same way again.."
4,Delicious Dirt!,"I found this book to be an entertaining read, quick and a tad bit sleazy - the perfect book for a plane or the beach. As a devote foodie, I laughed, was disgusted by some scenes and salivated over others! Not literary genius but certainly fun!"
3,funny guy...for a little while,"Chef is a very funny guy for a little while but his humor grew stale. The book started out very nicely but descended into an insiders tell all that became confusing and pointless. The chapters on how to cook and terminology we almost worth the price. But mentioning names of dishes so esoteric that few understand them much less differentiate good from bad was waaay too inside. I got the feeling that near the end that chef was naming names of friends as some sort of payback like ""hey I'll mention you in my book if you come work for me again.""I was glad to finish it, and also glad to know chef didn't end up dead of an overdose, which seems like a miracle. His best days in cooking and writing remain in front of him.He may run a fine two star room but his book became a one star read."
4,Very quick read - but not for the tame at heart.,"This is a great book for foodies, cooks, and especially cook wannabe's. Bourdain's writing style is very colorful and makes for an entertaining, quick read.One caveat, it may change (make that ""should change"") the way you eat in restaurants (ie - it ain't always pretty)."
3,"Sex, Drugs and Roquefort Cheese","An autobiographical account of Bourdain's continuing and chosen profession, Kitchen Confidential would mean absolutely nothing to anyone without a strong interest in food, the food trade or for that matter, life in 1970s and 1980s New York. I've eaten in many restaurants and I will now ask myself if the team visible behind the counter or windowed doors is largely made up of strung out, dope head pasta cooks, pastry artisans with no fixed address or bread makers with constant run ins with the law. Frankly, some of Bourdain's material is hard to swallow, so to speak. Still, Kitchen Confidential is engaging reading and a departure from anything this reviewer (and food lover) has read before. I would suggest matching it with a nice merlot."
2,Misleading.....,"The title and dust jacket info lead you to believe that the book will be a behind-the-scenes look at restaurants. The book actually turns out to be a choppily written autobiography.Much of the story simply follows the author around from failed restaurant to failed restaurant. This gets tedious fairly quickly.There are a few passages that describe what a busy kitchen is actually like, and the grace and skill involved when someone is trying to cook 5 different meals simultaneously. For a few pages, everything comes together the way I wish the whole book had. These bits are few and far between."
1,Rambling...needs editing,Too many adjectives. No documented information. Becomes boring. Reads like journal of person in recovery. Rambles on about... problems. Interesting information on chief tools. I heard him on talk show and got book from library. Disappointing.
3,"Fun, but not a ""must read"" for aspiring chefs","When I started culinary school, I was told that this book was a ""must read"" for anyone who wanted to be a chef. I bought it, but never read it. Finally, this year, I decided to bust through it. While it is fairly enjoyable, I hardly think it is a ""must read"" for any aspiring chef.Maybe I got lucky, but my experience working in restaurants is nothing like what Bourdain described. Maybe it's because I'm not in New York City, and maybe it's because it's no longer the 1980s, but the freakish work environment he described is pretty out of date. Besides, let's keep in mind that Bourdain never worked in the finest kitchens in NYC: he's a bistro cook. Sure, restaurant kitchens may still be a bit more ""crude"" than the professional offices of their patrons, but they're not the oozing dens of sin that Bourdain tries to describe. Read the book for the entertainment value, but remember that this is really just him reminiscing a bygone era."
4,Don't eat the meat!,"Well written, entertaining, and amusing. However, by his own admission, he exaggerates and overgeneralizes much of the time."
3,Review,Glad I didn't read this before I started working in the culinary world! It is a bit risqué and mostly talks about drugs and sex...which I realize is a big part of the culinary world. I guess I was just hoping to hear more about food than drugs. It was good a good read if you don't mind that other stuff.
4,Loved it!,"This chef knows how to write! Very well-written and highly entertaining memoir by an egomaniacal, testosterone-ridden and ultimatel erudite chef. I'll never be able to ignore a restaurant kitchen again. Instead, I'll tell myself, ""I know what's going on in there...!"" Mr. Bourdain's several afterwards are almost as insightful as the rest of his book."
4,"Some Good Laughs, Been There, He's Right.","This is Bourdain's memoir that chronicles his adventures as a newbie in a fish restaurant in Provincetown, to his life at Les Halles in NYC. He is blunt, coarse, yet his honesty is refreshing. He gives the reader the often true impression that disturbed folks are attracted to the cooking industry. From drugs, mobsters, booze, etc this is not a dull read. His disdain for tv chefs like Emeril, Flay, & Rachael Ray may be overstated? But, he shows high reverence for the 3-4 star chefs who work hard & rarely get any attention or credit. This is the loudest part of the book.He is equally honest about his own faults, drugs & his distaste for authority. Two chapters shine through the most. ""Bigfoot,"" practical info for the reader on dining out, & ""Cook like the pro's,"" on the art of managing people. All in all a fascinating look into an industry that only a small percentage of people ever experience."
1,kitchen confidential,Rairly have I read a book that I hate. This is it! Not only is it not funny but it is insulting to anyone who would sit in his dining room. Tony's fan base just lost one.
2,No Spice or Garnish. Just your everyday fare.,"First let me say that there was a chapter toward the end of the book that was an interesting description of an average day for a chef. The question is, after that nightmare description, why would anyone want to become a chef or work anywhere near a resturant kitchen? This book was advertised as a ""tell-all"" story about resturants. Instead of giving us a luscious scoop of resturant deJour, what the reader receives is more than you ever wanted to know about the suthor's drug habit. The story is shallow, uneven, and disjointed. If you want a good story to sink your teeth into then I suggest you look elsewhere."
3,The dark side of cooking,"Half expose, half memoir Kitchen Confidential is filled with enough hard boiled, macho commentary that it comes across as written by Mickey Spillane. Bourdain pulls no punches here; (if you go to a brunch after this you're probably a daredevil)his world of cooking is one of violence, long hours, drugs and alcohol, and more than enough enough testosterone. It's the constant machismo that wears thin after a while, when Bourdain is on target (""A Day in the Life"" will actually get your heart racing) this book is as good as it gets, but for every great section you have another like ""The Level of Discourse"" which reads like a discarded George Carlin bit. This balances out to an intriguing but basically flawed work, well-worth reading but the parts do not form a satisfying whole."
1,skip it,"By all accounts, this guy isn't much of a chef. Despite his fervent desire to be ""one of us"", he ain't.He's not much of a writer either. His words are forced, his scenarios are false, and he relies on stereotypes to support his portrayal of being somebody he's not. I couldn't care less that he's stupid enough to put herion into his veins. He's just another loser who wants to justify his inability to excel by somehow ""identifying"" with the rest of the people who really do work hard to put out a decent meal.Skip this nonsense. Look toward successful chefs for insight, whose words are few and far between. Bourdain is a fake. He's just cashing in on the FoodTV craze while at the same time condemning it. Fraud."
3,Didn't tell me what I really wanted to know,"Written by a chef working 17-hour days in a New York restaurant (when did he find the time?), this memoir supposedly exposes the ""culinary underbelly."" I found it entertaining enough, but I wanted to know how a restaurant really works. Bourdain never really got his teeth into that. Instead, it was an amusing anecdote, an exaggeration designed to impress, an inside joke for his friends on each page. I thought 90 percent was faulty memory or just plain embellishment. And at the end, I didn't know much more than when I started, other than that professional chefs look down on those of us who want to learn more about the restaurant business. But I will be fair: I did learn a few things, and I was moderately entertained."
2,Confusion Reigns,"I don't mind the foul language, I come from a construction background and understand that in some fields that it's almost ""necessary"". I thought the individual stories were interesting, but Bourdain keeps jumping around from memory to memory, not keeping with the ""timeline"" feel he starts out with. It's confusing to know which job he is refering to and where that particular job fits in the timeline.He also has a tendency to be long winded. I found myself jumping ahead of some of his descriptions that were quite predictable and over done.All in all, I was very disappointed in the book. The story of the ""underbelly"" of cuisine is a fascinating one, but Bourdain didn't quite ""cut the mustard"" with his version."
4,"Under the Raunchy Crust, Some Moral Fiber","Tony Bourdain seems like an upright guy to me. I know I'm eleven years late getting this review up, but maybe that gives me a little more perspective. In an age in which civilization seems regularly threatened by terrorist plots and corporate debacles, his sins seem venial. Nowhere is his moral compass more evident than in the penultimate chapter, entitled ""So You Want To Be A Chef? A Commencement Address."" Commandment #3 ""Don't Steal"" is the longest section, and perhaps the most valuable in highlighting the importance of personal integrity. Sure, the book is raunchy, not the sort of thing you'd recommend to the church ladies' book circle. Still, Chef Tony won me over with his passion for excellent food, his humble admission of personal limitations, and his use of self-deprecating humor. All the rock-and-roll and sharp knives helped, too."
3,Interesting,"After watching Bourdain on television for so long, I thought it time to read him. I know nothing of the world he lives in, but was entertained by the stories."
2,Overrated and overdone,"So we know he is manaical. How many stories about his drinking and drugging do we have to endure. This book would have made a much better short story, very short. It is not anything like what I expected. So I know he won't eat mussels in someone elses kitchen. I was expecting an ""expose"" on behind the scenes action. Silly me, I wanted more dirt on whether uneaten bread and chips go back in the basket for the next customer, not page after page of the foul words used in his kitchen. The only thing I think I can say that's positive, is that I have a real appreciation for the orchestration of the meals for a twelve-top. Sorry, I waited for this book for two weeks, and am amazed that I finished it."
5,A Hilarious and Informative Book!,"This was one of the most entertaining books I've read this year! I actually caught myself laughing aloud at various points throughout the book! My main question is - Who does Goliath think they are that they can treat people this way? I was truly amazed and appalled at the tactics these companies resort to and I heartily cheered for Megna and his clients all the way through. Keep up the great work!! Super book, super talent, super sense of humor!"
1,do not waste your time or money on this book,"The author tells a few war stories(obviously embellished), mixes in some attempts at humor (weak), and tries to convince us that there is some epidemic of bad cars and crooked auto dealers out there. The fact is that the types of problems set out in the book are VERY rare (if they happened at all). Anyone with a brain and a spine can handle a situation with a car dealer. 99% of the consuming public buys a car with no significant problems whatsoever, and they certainly do not need to hire an attorney to handle these minor disputes.If you must read about this topic, buy the book used, or wait until it is a $4.99 paperback. That's all it is worth. By the way, it looks like the author is getting his relatives to write good reviews for the book(see Chris Megna Sept 25). At least he has one fan !!"
3,Not that good for a beginner,"This is a very excellent compilation of Syriac texts, but unless the reader is extremely familiar with the Jacobite (Western) script, I wouldn't advise this piece. Also, the letters are very difficult to read even for people who are familiar with the text. Rather, I would recommend Joseph Pashka's ""Aramaic Gospels"" as a better selection."
5,rockin live album,This is a great album for parties or just ridin in your car! i should know i've been listening to this band ever since i was born! This is becuase the lead singer cliff johnson is my uncle! well anyway if you liked this album be sure to check out the new album fallin in!
4,Live in a tavern--Best they've sounded since the studio.,"I've heard them on the radio,seen them live at the Rockford Speedway,But by far this is the best I've ever heard Off Broadway. The funny thing is that it all happens in a small tavern in Berwyn,Il. The energy level is amazing,the pounding beat, DRIVING vocals will rock your world all over again! This is the farthest you will ever get from the synthetic 90's in a live album (CD) sorry. PURE ENERGY!"
1,Disappointing,"Some of the continuations of Andre Norton's worlds have been gems, and some of them have been disappointments. Beast Master's Ark is the worst to date. The original Beast Master was one of my favorite books, with Norton's classic complexity of phrase, her textured and troubled main character, and her believable yet alien world. This sequel has simplistic language, startling to someone expecting Norton's turn of phrase, and no plot to speak of. The story never generates tension, and there is no climax. McConchie does a great job with characterization, but good characters are not enough. There must be some story. To add insult to injury, there are multiple typos, and some editing mistakes like tense switching that add to the general sense of a book that is not well written. I am sorry that Andre Norton put her name to this one."
1,Not worth the tree to make the paper,"I must say, selling a dated book like this when you're talking about Websites is a shame. Sure some ideas might be timeless but this book uses poor example after poor example to make its point. I read another web book called ""Don't make me Think"" just before this one. I guess it would be like following Elvis with a kindergarden play. Save your money. Need I say more."
1,Do not buy this item!,"We purchased this to go with our new faucet, countertops and sink. Within one month of install, it began chipping. It appears that the item is not ""oil-rubbed bronze"" but plain old brown paint. Very, very disappointed."
1,Poor Finish...,"Looked alright when installed. Not really a very convincing oil rubbed bronze, but from a distance it has the right color to it. However, after only a month or so, the edge of the 'paint' started to flake off in large pieces. I could understand if it was just wearing through, but it crackles off like old dry paint. Poor job Insinkerator."
2,disappointed,The paint is wearing off of this and looks awful. We shouldhave gone to Kohler in the first place.
1,Do Not Buy!,"We bought this item October 27th and by Christmas the paint - yes paint - had chipped off in big chunks. I'm so irritated because the return policy is expired and i cant return it now because I didnt act fast enough. So dont buy the ""oil rubbed"" or PAINTED BROWN sink flange from Insinkerator. Guaranteed waste of your hard earned money."
3,"Insinkerator disposal flange, matte black","On the positive side, it does fit well and is easy to install, if you enjoy pulling your disposal and reinstalling it! Actually, it was fairly easy to put this thing in. Now for the negative-it's been in for only 2 years now, and the finish is already starting to wear off in two spots. And it's not like I'm using sandpaper on it, or steel wool. I use a teflon-safe 3M pad and some SoftScrub gel with bleach to help sanitize the area. The finish should hold up a lot longer for 20 bucks, like maybe 10 or more years. If I wanted a base metal-colored disposal flange, I would have just left in the one that was there before I put this one in!"
1,Misleading title,"This book is not even close to being the definitive guide to Direct3D. At best it's an introduction, and covers even less material than other introductions (eg Frank Luna's book or Wolfgang Engel's book).The first 20 pages are given over to installing DirectX SDK. Complete waste of time for anyone who can read the SDK install doc. The chapter on video playback is pure filler - that is not part of Direct3D and shouldn't be in the book. You would learn just as much D3D by following the free SDK tutorials or some of the excellent (free) Internet tutorials.To make matters worse, he defines his own linked list class, instead of using the STL std::list. That's always a bad sign in my book.All in all very poor. Stick with the SDK docs and Internet tutorials."
3,I will never be the same,"Since Aristotle, there has been a tremendous fear that some kinds of thinking have not established themselves well enough to avoid the contradictions that doom everything to futility. This book clearly is in favor of human life of a particular kind to go along with the thinking that fits a world created by God. Darwin would not have had so much trouble writing down his ideas if the creation had all fallen into place in the six days that simple minds could accept to limit a dynamic process to what each person knows as a week. There has been a song about some days.Blurring the EdgesShe sings: some days you can't explain.Rock and roll has provided people who listen with ideas that create a different universe than the kind of thinking in this book."
3,Easy-read text book for my university course,"This is a great book as far as textbooks go. It is easy to read, very informative and has good tables and figures for developing behavioral objectives. I think this will also be a great reference in the future for other classes or even a Master's or Doctoral thesis. I will be keeping this textbook in my ""library"" as I feel that it will serve me well now and in the future."
5,will not be returning this book!,"This book is both informative, and easy to understand. I will not be selling it back, but keeping it to refer to in the future."
1,Don't bother to order this product,This product came very late and looked old and used. There are a lot of scratch marks on the clear vinyl cover and the size is not generous enough for a thicker than normal magazine. I would want to return it but having to pay shipment and spending time doing it is just not worth it. Buyer beware!
3,It is an average read,It is a pleasant read but I would not go as far as to say it is hilarious. Buy only if it is free.
3,You get what you pay for,Free book means I can't complain too much. Next time I'll just drive to the library and get something I like.
1,Don't Bother,This was a boring horrible book. I kept hoping it would be better but alas....it didn't. I realize it's a free download but really? Who would publish this?!
3,Average book,"This story grew on me as I read it but I wouldn't categorize it as a favorite. The subtle humor laced throughout the diary entries made it enjoyable. Overall it was a fictional look into the lives of a small family from long ago in a European setting. Common themes of family expectations and marital relationships helped make a link to present day. If you want to try something a little different in style you may want to read this book. I would not call it a ""must read,"" but more of a time-filler."
3,mildly hulourus,"Somepeople describe this book as falling down funny, I don't see it, mildly humourus is my description, perhaps it is just not me. It doesn't have much guts and to read about a boring person leaves me bored. Thorogoods A Little Bit of Fun is about average people but it is fun and faster moving, perhaps I like books that are witty and zappy. Be that as it may there is some funny stuff here, try 3 men in a boat for a good fun read."
3,A quick read - back to life in the late 1800's,"I ordered this book off the back of reading a history of London (recommended as supplementary reading). Whilst I found it a little slow to get into the story, about one quarter of the way through you get totally involved in Charles Pooter's soap-opera, day-to-day adventures... and all of a sudden you are looking forward to the next page, and the next page! A very quick read that takes to you back to life in the late 1800's."
2,Be aware of what you're buying,"If you've seen this box in the store, you may have noticed the running time listed as 130 minutes. This is very deceptive. The feature is only 48 minutes long - the rest is bonus features which my small children have very little, if any, interest in using."
3,"Great on the history, but short on What's New!","Fascinating book on the history and lore of Atlantic salmon fishing and flies. The salmon fishing stories are wonderful. However, for a book that was up-dated in 1995, the chapter on ""The New Look in Salmon Tackle"" was very out-of-date -- graphite rods aren't even mentioned.On the other hand, I found the sections on how salmon take flies, and wet-fly and dry-fly fishing methods useful.The writing on salmon flies and their history is fascinating.This is my first book on the topic so I can't say how it compares with others."
3,Missing original music,"I loved the original version of this, which is why I purchased another copy when my VHS tape wore out. To my surprise and disappointment, the music has been changed during the aerobic portion. The original songs were replaced with redundant and mellow background music that was poorly dubbed in. It's also quite odd to hear Denise say ""this is my favorite song"" or ""I love this song"" when it's a boring and even annoying, repetitious sound that now plays. The music is not at all inspirational or energizing; it almost makes me want to take a nap.The exercise routine is fabulous! I just can't recommend that you purchase this changed version. I really wish there was a DVD version of the original!"
3,Comercial Compromise,"Don't get me wrong I love Disciple, I even really like this album. But this is NOT their best work! They seem to have gotten away from the edgy Boldness in their lyrics that made them great. Musically it is toned down a little too. It has had great radio success with the song ""after the world"", and thats what I mean by the compromise. They are more radio friendly, and that is never a good thing for a band that is famous for making a difference! It is a little less BOLD, and a little Milder than their previous releases. By God, This Might Sting a Little, and Back Again are by far better albums."
5,Solar Power Charger,Bought one for myself after seeing it at at Quantico Marine Base and then purchased one for a friend in Kuala Lumpur to help keep his car battery charged.
4,Sandwhich's,"Our two year old loves to play cook and serve food to mom & dad , gma /gpa , etc. Relativly realistic and they appeal to a tough critic."
4,Interesting,"It was interesting. It was not as in depth as the show i saw on the history channel.In that aspect, I was slightly disappointed."
3,Another Mystery of the Bible,"In this segment of the ""Mysteries of the Bible"" series I expected the film would ""Unlock the Secrets behind the Bible's Most Elusive Book."" In fact the presentation opened more questions than it answered. The various narrators represent various faiths, cultures, including theologians, historians, and archaeological findings. Subject matter was introduced but in this short segment could not be adequately developed. The strong point of the presentation is the resultant hunger created to learn more on this fascinating mystery."
1,Useless,"It is inconceivable to me that someone could sit down to create a Swedish-English dictionary and not include the gender of Swedish nouns, i.e. whether they are ""ett"" or ""en"" words. One also needs to know the noun plurals for definite and indefinite forms, which are difficult in Swedish. This book is a rip off and I am mad I bought it."
2,Very inefficient for English speakers to use!,"This book does not contain the genders of the nouns, or their formation in the plural. It is obviously for Swedish speakers only."
3,Swedish/English Dictionary,"A thick paperback filled with information, words and translation. Thicker than pocket size but would work great in a backpack."
1,Not a good first bike,"Pedals kept falling apart and off the boke! So instead of riding the bike on his birthday, my son had to wait while dad used what we could find in our personal belongings to correct and tighten pedals. Also the pretty plastic inserts in the wheels - we had to take them off after several times my son complained that bike is too heavy to pedal. It turned out the inserts were in a way - touched the spin needles and kept the bike from rolling smoothly. I will not buy a bike online again - it is better to test ride one before buying. And this particular bike I would not recommend to anyone - too many problems."
4,Almost Perfect,Very user friendly DVD player. Unit is quite large - I had to take the back of my stereo cabnet off to make it fit. Very nice picture and sound quality. There are a lot of handy features on the remote that I like too. One feature this DVD player has that I personally wish it didn't is the disc recall memory. If you watch a DVD less than all the way through (like stopping it during the end credits) and even if you take the DVD out of the player and put it in again several weeks or months later it begins to play right where you left off the last time you played it. You have to go to the DVDs main menu chapter selection option to get around it. Also it does not play every type of DVD disc out there like I thought it would.
4,Self Esteem & Self Image,This CD has helped me relax a bit and not worry so much about what people think of me. It has helped me to see my self worth and appreciate who I am.
3,good start,"This book is good in a sense that it gives you a general idea about the American culture. Also, it provides a list of references (books and movies) at the end of each chapter for people who want to learn more about the subject presented on that chapter.Also, you should know that this book is originaly intended for people who are studying the Englisg language and it provides many excercises at the end of each chapter."
1,Too little stuff for the money,I bought this item for my daughter and it is not worth the money. The items are cheap plastic and some are even cardboard. This would be a great deal if offered at the dollar store. Pass.
1,Didn't care for the book,"I suppose the book has some value, but I didn't care for it. The author does get the reader to think outside the box. The book isn't like most real estate investment ""flip"" books written today. If you're interesting in flipping, there are several better books to get you started. If your a novice, this book is not applicable to you other than it's potential motivational aspects or feel good attitude. Spend your energy, time, and money on other flipping books."
5,Timex stop watch,We have used several other brands of stop watches for our testing program and they have had nearly the same cost as Timex. These have functioned perfectly each time and the reliability is wonderful. js
1,Deceiving buy,Deceiving buy. Not at all what I thought it would be. Different from what's written in summary. I was very disappointed. I just threw it away.
4,kit aircraft composites primer,"This book deals almost exclusively with fiberglass in epoxy, though some of the concepts carry over to other materials. Covers foam cored sandwich structures and vacuum bagging. Excellent resource from the standpoint of one who wishes to make large structural composites at reasonable cost, both from the use of less expensive fabric and creative use of cheap consumables. There is a lot of focus on making molds of easily obtainable smooth surfaces-- and this contributes to real time savings compared to polishing rough molds. The last third of the book contains a series of exercises designed to teach the techniques sequentially."
5,WORDS ARE GOOD FOR YOU !!!!,A very good and appealing text for foreign students to learn new words.Graphics is perfect.We are enthusiastic with it.
4,"gardiner pays tribute to schumann,s greatness","I bought this cd because of gardiner. I love the music of schumann and having his entire orchestral works was great but I must admit there are weak points in it. some of it is rather stiff and the volume levels are not always good. I recently bought george szell,s versions and must admit they are better. But overall gardiner does a great job."
5,LOVE IT!!,"I have been using this pump since my daughter was born 7 weeks ago. It is very easy and comfortable to use, and works very quickly. I highly reccomend this pump to anyone who plans to pump on a regular basis."
2,this product is diecontinued,"i used this pump for my first and just called playtex for replacement parts (need new cups) to use with my second & they informed me that this model has been discontinued for 2 years, so they do not have any replacement parts. Also, the parts for the current model they have ""have not been tested for compatibility"" with the embrace model & they would not even let me purchase them to see if i could make it work. But they offered me a coupon for the new model, really? what a waste of money, i will not be going with playtex for my next pump."
2,not working,we turned on the pump and it sounding good then we turned off and few momments later turned it on again and was not pumping fully. I called Playtex and they said I have to call back with Serial # and they can send a new motor. If the new motor works then everything is ok. But we need to pump now. The baby is at another hospital from her mom and she needs the pump.
2,Worked well WHEN it worked,This pump worked well when it worked and that is the only reason I gave it two stars. The first Embrace pump I had suddenly went out on me before my daughter was a week old. I called and they sent me another but in the mean time I was told to purchase a hand pump and send the receipt in for reimbursement. I sent the receipt in and never was reimbursed. When my daughter was five months old the second pump went out. The lady on the phone was friendly and told me this pump was made to withstand more use than I was giving it. Once again they sent me a new motor. I asked about the previous reimbursement and was told she would look into it and get back with me. It has been over a month and I still haven't heard anything. My baby sitter also had this pump with her first child and had the same thing happen but when her second one went out they refused to send her another saying they had already sent one. For the money I would go with another brand.
5,Great Pump!!!!,"I am a working mother of 3. The pump I used with my other children was big, bulky, loud, difficult to clean all the parts, and you could tell what it was when I brought it in to work.This pump is much smaller, quite, the cups come apart for easy cleaning (great design, both functional and comfortable), and comes in a great carring case with everything you need (even a car power adapter). Playtex took their time to release this, but it shows in the design, comfort and function of this pump, you just can't beat it."
3,Very comfortable but a few design flaws,"The Playtex breast pump is very comfortable but there are a few design flaws with this brand new model. The bottles that you pump into have a lip at the top of the bottle so when you pour the milk into a storage bag not all of it comes out, some stays on the rim. If you are concerned about saving every last drop (which I am because I have a baby in the hospital so pumping is my only means of feeding her) this pump does not work well. Even the breast cup has groves that milk gets trapped in. When it comes to cleaning all the groves can make getting it completely dry a challenge.Because I am constantly pumping it is nice to have the comfortable/cushy cups for pumping. I use the Medela pump at the hospital so I am familiar with both brands and the Playtex model is much better for comfort."
1,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY,This pump is terrible. First of all it is loud. Second of all it is not at all powerful. It will NOT empty your breast. I pumped & pumped & pumped & hardly got any milk. The more I pumped the less milk I got out. I was losing my milk supply fast!!!!!! I called my lactation consultant & she had me pumping every 15 minutes to regain my milk supply. That didn't work this motor is not powerful enough. I ended up having so much milk left in my breasts they got painfuly engorged & then resulted in getting Mastitis. I eventually had to rent a hospital grade breast pump that worked. Don't waste your money on this pump. It looks great but I can't say anything else positive about it. I gave it one star because that is the lowest you can give. I really give it zero stars. It is very expensive. I suggest renting a hospital grade pump. It is much cheaper & will definately work.
4,I really like this pump,"I bought this pump based on the recommendation of the sales associate and have never regretted it. I bought this soon after giving birth and have been nursing 9 months now. The Embrace is very comfortable and doesn't painfully pull you like the Medela does. I pump twice a day at work and have never had a problem with not having an adequate milk supply. I recommend using the double pump feature rather than one side at a time. The reason for the 4 star rating is the pump is kind of noisy and to purchase extra parts, you have to go through Playtex directly. Other than that, I have been very satified with this pump."
4,Does the job,"I needed this lid for a large omelette pan i have. It fits great. The only reason i gave it 4 stars and not 5 is because the inside of the lid, went all brown after i used it. But it does the job, covers my pan perfectly. Still a great buy."
3,Serves the purpose,"I wanted this to cover my large Calphalon frying pan. I wish it fit more closely over the pan, like a ""lock fit,"" but it's the right size; problem is only that it just rests on top of the pan. The enamel has chipped a little near the handle. Not unhappy with it though."
5,Does what it's supposed to do,"Covers pans. My only complainst is that the lid looks broken, but it's not. There's a funny lip on the handle that works as a steam valve, but I was alarmed and thought it was broken at first. Good price for a pot lid!"
1,Wait for the 2nd edition,"While this book has some good information, it has too many errors to be useful.I believe the authors know their stuff, but I guess they were just in too big a hurry to get it out in time for Lotusphere 99 (which is where I bought my copy).On average, there is one error per 2 pages of this book! Really. It's unbelievable that McGraw Hill would let something like it out. It's not just the explanatory text, but the sample questions are full of errors, too. You have to pay close attention to what is going on in this book because you can get very confused reading it.Hopefully, the authors go back through it again and reissue it after they've cleaned up the errors. I believe the book could be a big help to anyone studying for the exam once the errors are corrected."
2,Disappointed,"The DVD looks more promising than it actually is.The workout targets people that have been working out for a while, if you are one of the lucky ones it is recommended!"
5,HOT and FUN,This video is just that Hot and Fun!!! Not just because the girls are sexy but I actually felt my tempature get hot and was feeling my muscles right away in spots I had not felt in years. It really does cover all those tough spots that us ladies would like to tone and it is nice because being a four disc DVD you can switch them up on different days or do them all together. I usually do one of the warmups and then just switch the menu for each disc to the primary workout and try to do them all if I can. The music is fun and the setting is really nice because it kinda takes you away to the paradise of California. Very easy to follow and the more you do them the more you pay attention to what you are doing and concentrate. When I am done with these I am going to try out the Carmen Electra workouts considering this was put together with the same producer that put together her sexy workouts too!!!!GO get EnvyYou know you want some!!! :)
2,Not a typical American Experience historical narrative.,Some people watch American Experience for well written historical narratives. A few minutes into this Amish piece and it appears to be a documentary of short testimonials from Amish individuals - not even a Q&A with an interviewer - and no historical narrative of any kind. This could easily have been done on another program on another network with little to no effort.
2,More like Tattooing A to C,"Although the most technical ""how to"" tattoo book available, It still lacks much of the information needed. Hardly worth the ... price tag."
4,Hitch,Picture is showing the wrong hitch. What you see is not what you get.The one you get mounts right behind the bumper. This picture should be changed. I called them on it to no avail.
3,Fairing,"The product fit just as described. Personally I think that it seems like a lot of money for a piece of plastic to go in front of a roof rack. It was a present for my teenage nephew, but there is no way I would have spent the money for the item for myself."
2,Not compatible with some sunroofs,"This product is well-made and easy to install. However, because of the way it juts forward from the Yakima rack, its feet set right on the sunroof of our '06 CRV. There is no way to adjust for this overlap. Once installed, the fairing obstructs some of the view through the sunroof, but more importantly we can no longer tip the sunroof up to let air in. This has made the fairing unusable for us, so we are returning it."
2,Very mild and sweet,"This product is labeled at ""medium"" spice, though I would call it extra extra mild and sweet. It tastes like Top Ramen. This is not the flavor I think of when I think of curry!"
3,Still havent recieved it...,When I heard that this DVD was finally avaiable. I got really happy but its still not out yet. I have been waiting to recieve it. Hopefully it will come soon.
3,Not Free SF Reader,"Black ape, brown ape, naked ape.Or, a series that went on a bit too long here, really, and Gerrold did his best with what he had to work with - which in this case was not a lot.Or the nice guy chimps et. al. get to come into conflict with mutants and gorillas. Actually doesn't sound too bad when you put it that when, in the good old cheesy sense, does it?Not as fun as it sounds, though."
1,Buy generic and save BIG Bucks,"The Canon Elph accessory pack is very expensive for what you get. I would suggest going to any retail store (like Walmart, Best Buy, Circuit City) and buy a generic camera case (need spend no more than $5 - 10 bucks). You can then buy a spare battery online for $15. No sense to waste money....."
2,"Great Price, but Case Too Small for Canon SD990IS","Case was a handsome leather hardcase, but was too tight a fit for Canon SD990IS. Also, case had no pocket for extra card or battery. Have not used the included straps. But price for the entire accessory kit was a few dollars less than buying just a battery, so getting the case was kind of like getting a freebie for buying an extra battery on its own."
4,Worked well,"I mainly bought this package for the extra battery it would provide. For just a few bucks more, I get a case and metal neck strap. The case was nice and comfortable on my belt and worked well for walking around town to snap some pics on vacation. I had no need for the neck strap. Its quite long and not too comfortable in the heat, so I left it at home. The battery worked fine and I got a couple days, 100's of pictures and a dozen or so video's off just one charge. I think it was a good value."
3,Can't Store an Extra Battery,"Great little case but should have listened to everyone else when they said it doesn't store a spare battery. Having a spare battery and/or memory card in the same spot as your camera is pretty important. I forget the backup battery every time I go out. It's only a matter of time before it will cost me lost pics due to a dead camera. Otherwise the case is nice and sturdy to help protect it but will add extra bulk which defeats the purpose of buying a small camera in the first place. It can no longer fit it your pocket. I haven't tried the necklace and I'm sure the battery would work just fine if I ever remember to ring it along. My son got a small video camera that came with a thin cloth case to keep it in. It won't protect the camera from breakage but will protect it from scratches and will not add to the size of the camera. However, this case doesn't store a spare battery either."
2,I liked the old case better,"I owned the powershot S400 and bought the canon case that went with it. When my S400 died (which I was not happy about) I bought a Powershot SD 790 and the canon case that went along with it. Despite the fact that the SD 790 is smaller than the S400, this new case is actually a little larger than the old case. It is stiffer and appears to have more padding. It's kind of weird because my SD 790 fits a little loose in the old case but is snug in the new larger one. I prefer the look, feel, and smaller size of the old case.The neck strap I don't care about and probably won't use. The battery, I'm sure, will be fine."
4,"Battery, Bag and Chain","Not much to say; the battery works, the camera fits in the case and the strap is fine. If it could serve breakfast too, it would rate a 5. It is simply a product that does exactly that it is supposed to do; no more and no less."
2,Not the best,The case is pretty good and the extra battery is nice to have. The other items in the package are not that usefull. I wish the case had a place to but extra batteries or memory cards.
2,A very tight fit,"I found the case to be a very tight fit and wondered whether it was somehow damaging the camera (probably not the case, but was uncomfortable cramming it in and extracting it). It also added considerably to the bulk so that the ease of carrying around this elegant camera was cancelled out. I'm not a camera beltwearer, so that feature means nothing to me. I will explore the Target option suggested by another reviewer. If nothing else is available, I'll look for some kind of pouch. The main thing, as I see it, is protecting the screen, and a pouch might do the trick."
3,Handy but!,I purchased this kit along with an SD900. Although the case looks very neat and elegant but I hated one thing about this leather case.. There isn't any place to keep the extra battery that come up with the kit or even any extra memory card that you would definitely need to carry! I wish there was at least one place for that..!
5,Exactly as expected,"I'm very happy with the accessory kit. The case is a nice leather and there is actually enough room to tuck a spare memory card in it. I now have more straps than I know what to do with. The kit comes with both a leather strap that matches the case and the neck strap, plus I still have the original strap, but I guess its nice to have options."
4,very nice camera,beautiful.. you will like the features. except the date stamp is not avialable!! only with post card settings.
4,Accessories needed,I USE the camera case and extra battery. There is no instruction for the long cord. I am clueless as to WHERE to put the camera case when taking pictures. My best guess is that I slide it up; but it looks dorky.
5,Digital Elph Accessories,Happy to get this package at a reasonable price.Spare battery and camera case essential from my point of view.
4,simple,"unpack and unfold it. done. adjusts to different sizes, longer than i expected but makes it more useful. great value for the price."
5,sue,I bought one of these tables and loved it so much I bought another. They are great when you need a little extra room to work. I sew so I can always use extra space. When I find these at a decent price again I will probably get another one.
3,50 Great Golf Lessons of The Century,"I thought this book was informative, but not as good as I thoughtit would be. I don't believe the author presented the lessons ashe intended the readers to grasp them."
5,Need another one!,My husband says the design is very comfortable. He likes it so much that he asked for another one to use at work!
4,"Great topics: Evil Dead, H.P. Lovecraft & Barbara Steele","This book contain essays and reviews of various horror topics. Three of my favorites were on Barbara Steele, The Evil Dead and movie adaptions of H.P. Lovecraft stories. The movies of Barbara Steele are cult classics and hard to obtain. Black Sunday and others are discussed in this Journal. With the recent reissue of the Evil Dead on video, the article discussing this movies is a timely one. I agree with the article on the movies made of H.P. Lovecraft's stories-none have done justice to his writing. One of the better movies however, is video Necromonmicon which is a collection of several of Lovecraft's stories. In this journal I was also introduced to the films of Jean Rollin and others. All in all, it was good to read about my favorites and learn more about similar material out there."
5,Amazing,"I had a Toshiba notebook that was only a few years old. We had replaced almost every part of that computer and it was still crashing. When I decided it was time for me to buy a new notebook I looked into the Vaio, as I have always liked the high quality screen. This computer got great reviews and the price was reasonable, so I went ahead and bought it. It has not been disappointing! My husband, who really wanted me to buy a ThinkPad, is now in love with this notebook. It is very thin and light, but the screen is large enough that I can use it as my primary computer. I love it!"
1,Throwing it out the window,"We were sucked in by the brand name and great price but have had problems with this ""Sony"" from day one. All of the buttons have slow response times. For example, it takes forever to eject a disk. And when you're playing a CD, it takes forever to advance from one track to the next.The VCR has tracking issues with every tape we own--tapes that work fine on other VCR players. And when you're playing a tape and you press rewind to go back to something you missed, it stops and goes to a blue screen. You can't watch it rewind.The remote is problematic too--you have to press ""Play"" to make a selection because the ""Enter"" button doesn't do anything at all. It's very unintuitive.We donated our old no-name DVD and VCR when we ""upgraded"" to this fancy all-in-one, but we would give anything to have them back again. They took up more space, but at least they worked!! I can see by the reviews that some people lucked out and got machines that worked. I wouldn't risk it if I were you."
1,Very Poor Quality,"I recently removed the cable from the back of my Sony SLVD360P DVD/VCR Combo. Instead of the cable coming off, THE STUB CAME OUT. Sony reduced their manufacturing cost by $.01 and didn't secure the stub with a nut on the inner side of the unit. They depended upon the thin wire to provide enough resistance to enable the user to unscrew the cable. Mind you all such cables have a nut fitting to use a wrench to secure and remove said cable. I should have read the reviews before I purchased the unit but instead went on their reputation. Too bad, Sony used to make some good products. Save you money and reduce your time and aggravation, buy a product made by someone reliable like Panasonic or Samsung."
2,ok but....,"the problem is the hinge that keeps it closed, it was soooo lose i had to tighten it with a screw drive when it arrived, and even with it tightened, how do i explain, its like the hinge is the wrong size or placed wrong and keeps the two pieces apart, and so now i have to put this in a sandwich bag so i dont lose the pieces, the hinge is worthless and im going to have to replace it with something functionalsays USA made, feels cheap chinese made, COME ON USA - you can do better!!! disappointing"
2,Only if you are on a deserted island,"Is this food? I am not sure. Is it edible? Maybe if your one of those people who used to be on TV and couldn't figure out how to get off the island. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend this soup. I was told that it actually tastes a bit more like wallpaper paste and less like food. I bought this because it was in the gluten free section (as a glitch I suppose since the noodles are made from wheat) and made one packet. I thankfully read the ingredient list before I tried it but everyone else dumped it down the sink after one bite. Even the dogs wouldn't eat the broth. So I suppose if you are looking for some small red bookends I could sell you a set. The boxes are very stylish you know. The product inside shouldn't even be called food."
3,lipton soup,It was ok price alittle to high priced. Glad I had gift card to get this item . Won't buy again cheaper at the store to get.
3,Not bad for an instant noodle,But I still prefer ramen chicken flavor noodles from Maruchan. They have more fuller taste and texture to the noodles. These have a slight watery aftertaste that the ramen noodles don't.
2,spiritual notes on myself,"Although the book does contain some helpful insights re: spiritual development, it is not as powerful or ingenius as previous books by Prather, such as ""The Book of Games"" which is one of my all-time favorites."
2,Interpretations of Gurdjieff's Music,"You may want to pass this one up if you enjoy Gurdjieff's music as he intended it to be. To me these seem like rambling, flimsy interpretations of strong, articulate works (if you have heard any of the Kremski recordings, you know).The arrangements do not seem to have captured the spirit of Gurdjieff's music very well. If someone did with Beethoven what has been done with Gurdjieff's music here, I don't think it would be taken seriously.If you are interested in a new ""twist"" on Gurdjieff's music, then you may enjoy this. If you enjoy Gurdjieff's music closer to the way which he composed it, then you will want to look for a different recording."
4,Show in two parts,"In my opinion the show can be split into 2 parts:Songs 1 -14 unexeptional songs and really "" nothing to tell home about"" but fromsong 15, a new show begin:perfect, amazing and amotion performance.enjoy this BD disc very much.Albert"
1,Poor learning tool,"This is a very poorly designed learning program. There seems to be no clear direction or emphasis. The video shows a bunch of seemingly random scenes and words. The video could almost be mistaken as a PR stunt for the kids in the video.There is no stepping stone approach, as is expected from an effective learning tool. For example, one of the words taught in the first 5 minutes of the video is the telugu word for Butterfly. For those who don't know Telugu, this is one of the most complicated words (7 syllables!) that some adults don't even know !I do not recommend this video for anyone looking to learn Telugu - let alone for kids."
2,Reach excedes grasp,"I like Greil's approach, which worked so much better in the recent ""Like A Rolling Stone: Bob Dylan At The Crossroads"", of honing in on small detail to produce something profound. Maybe this book can be considered practice for the latter, because it simply didn't work here. I welcome experimental writing, but in this case the wash of minute detail combined with nonlinearity produced confusion rather than clarity. I'm afraid for me the insights are Greil's alone rather than universal. To his credit though, in the same way I'd rather see an ambitious indie movie that fails than a Hollywood blockbuster, reading this is worth a shot. I may try again some time."
1,Marcus likes his own voice,I was sorely disappointed in this book. It is free form writing and literary masturbation. It is in dire need of an editor. As a massive fan of The Band I was wanting some insight into the Basement Tapes of Bob Dylan with The Band.....I did not receive this. I wish it had been more informative and less of a rambling diatribe.
2,not true to the kenshin style and spirit,"Technically, the OVA is beautiful, so no complaints about that. However, the story was not in line with what I feel Kenshin to be all about. The movie is ridiculously sad and lacks the charm, wit, and humour of the series and the characters are so far-removed from their original selves, I found it hard to believe that these events could really happen, that Kaoru and Kenshin would really react that way. Their decisions negate the realizations they made in the original story. I realize the OVA represents one view of what could happen, but honestly, I cannot even accept it as a possible choice."
2,Unnecessary summary of the TV series,If you haven't seen the TV series this is very confusing or at least not coherent. Even when you have watched the TV series this is a waste of time - The other OVA is far better - stick to that instead.
3,"Its ok, but not really Kenshin styl....","It was ....well....ok... I just dont like to see endings like that in a very good show.I gave it three stars because of the quallity and that the story line wasn't messed up.but, they dont talk the same and the drawing styl isnt even like the original.Its one of these movies where you gobuying->watching->being dissapointed->learning to accept it->throwing it in the Trash"
5,sad...,"This movie was soo sad I found myself crying at work after wathcing it. I know that sounds cerazy because it's a cartoon but... I can't even watch teh show now because I know how Kenshin dies. Weak and with almost no memory of his past life. He forgot all his friends, all the battles he was in, and he forgot what a great man he was. He can hardly even talk. It's hard to think of him being this way and being the last part of the story thats how I will allways remember him.."
2,The death of my hero (Archangel),How could they have shown his death so patetic. Now that I know his death I feel sad and now my Kenshinmania is over
1,Another example of sci-fi in sequal overdrive (overkill),"Clarke revisits something that should be left well enough alone. 2001 is a classic that stands on itsown, tampering only diminishes it. Of course the lure of fame and fortune overcame any thought of that. I recommend going back and reading Clarke's earlier work and skipping 2061, and 3001 for that matter."
4,"Fantastic voyage, can't wait for sequel","Great book, it leaves you on the edge of your seat, but it doesn't really finish. The book obviously will carry over in 3001, can't wait to read it!"
2,2061 -- not a timeless masterpiece,"This third book of the series is fairly bad. The characters were two dimensional--if they got in trouble, I didn't even care whether they would survive. The way Clarke returned some of the characters from 2001/2010 is contrived at best.The biggest disappoint with 2061 is that Clarke chose to project political intrigue going on when he wrote it some 75 years into the future, as had been done on a shorter timeframe with 2010. The trouble is that he chose something that was a transient issue. Having done this, the plot builds (with no excitement) to an absolutely silly and preposterous ending.I suggest skipping it altogether. Just say to yourself, ""What with one thing and another, the oblisk arranged for some of the old characters to be around for the next book"" -- and then jump to 3001. (I don't think that counts as a spoiler since that information is on the back covers of 2061 and 3001.)"
2,300-Page Segue,"That's about all 2061 is: a nearly 300-page segue into the next book in the series and not enough to make a novel on its own. 2001 is a classic and a pretty good read. 2010 was a very good read--enjoyable, well-paced, engaging with interesting and surprising characters, etc.2061 is a big disappointment. It's almost completely devoid of plot or point, centering on an implausible twist with no bearing on anything else going on in the series--and that one simple twist is all that's here. What there is of suspense and adventure is flimsy and doesn't support a whole novel.This is just scientific (and pseudo-scientific) exposition about Europa, Jupiter (nee Lucifer), Earth and the rest of the Solar System and it's pretty boring exposition at that. Not at all up to its predecessors. Presumably it leads up to something in 3001; this whole novel should have been maybe two chapters at the start of that book."
4,Good sci-fi adventure,"I have just finished reading this book and thought that ACC did a fairly good job in writing it. Like most others I enjoyed the first two books very much, but this one seemed to lack the spirit of those first two books. It is a good read none the less and I would recommend the reading of all four of the books in this series. I have one question however that I don't remember being resolved. When Universe was on the comet and Dr. Chant was investigating one of the caves, he was stunned to find a glowing light. He theorized that it might be many things but settled upon a theory stating that the glowing light may be bioluminescent organisms living in the comet. Was there ever a definte explanation for this glow? Again overall good book!"
2,ZZZZZ,"This book left me thinking I was in a class room. The whole book seemed like a text book than a science fiction novel. 2001 incorporated a great plot packed with suspense and intrigue. This book was crap. I fell asleep 3 times while reading it. When I finally concluded the text book, I realized the entire tedious process took nearly a month.This book left no impressions on me, save a horrible headache."
3,Magic is gone,"I just got to watch bits and pieces of this season on TV so being a huge Will and Grace fan, I purchased it. Its not half as good as the previous ones. I could barely remember cracking a smile once during this whole season. They should have stopped while they were at season 4 or 5 because this season is shameful."
2,Unwieldy in every sense of the word,"It's huge. It's heavy. You'd better leave this one on the coffee table. If you expect to hold it in one hand while flipping channels, you'd better invest in a wrist brace.Complementing the klunky case is a klunky interface. There are Activity macro buttons, but the names are hardcoded. It can control multiple devices, but you can't assign buttons from different devices to a single button layout. (For example, you can't have access to your TV volume buttons and your cable box's channel buttons at the same.) Further, some relatively common buttons like Page Up and Page Down are absent altogether.It's very pretty, at least when the LCD backlight is off. Unfortunately, the deeply recessed LCD display is downright ugly when illuminated.I returned mine the next day and bought a Logitech Harmony 550. It was almost $50 less, and I'm much happier with it."
1,A total waste of money and time. Sound:Mid-East Bong Babble,"I was a huge fan of Alanis until this CD. This CD is a waste of money and time. Evidently, Alanis earned enough money from the Jagged Little Pill that she can afford to record utter and complete babbling crap.Every track on the CD with the exception of Thank U sounds exactly the same. Morose, shrieking, drug induced, psychotic, and sometimes comatose lyrical nightmares.I cannot fully express how much I hated this CD, but perhaps the military can find a use for it in the psychological warfare tactical department."
2,India is know for producing sleepiness,"One word here . . . ""Sleep."" This collection of overwrought psychological meanderings and slick willy production lacks depth and doesn't strike much of a chord. Alanis whines and no one I know cares. The songs seem too static and repeatative to me to strike any interest. Thank you India for at least one bonafide sleep inducer."
2,The Truth,"Alanis lost her way. What happened to that music wisdom? Her lyrics still bear the distorted human soul, and they are even stronger in this new cd, but the melodies just dont fit. Well, "" Thank U"" and "" Joining You"" are masterpieces, but the rest of the songs are drowning in the sea of frailty."
1,"Nothing liked the first, and this bugged me","I liked her first album a lot better. I can still listen to it, some 7 years later. But this one? Nyah. I've listened to it several times, and it has never grabbed me. But others seemed to like it, so maybe I'm just missing something. My recommendation? If you can, borrow it before you buy it."
3,WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED,Jagged Little Pill was so much better than this newer album. It's good but I think Alanis is getting soft. I still love her though and probaly always will.
4,"Good Lyrics-average music--check out ""that I would be good""","Once agian, good follow up album. Songs not quite a s radio friendly as her first release,but over all a good solid album. The only problem is that the music doesn' t fit the lyrics all thje time."
4,"This is a good follow up to ""Jagged Little Pill""","This is a good CD. It's not quite as harsh as her last one. This CD is a little more peaceful, and feels as though Alanis has 'grown up' a little. My favorite songs are: Thank U, and Front Row. All the songs are about love and relationships. I think everyone should listen and consider this CD, it's a good one....."
3,Nothing grabs my attention.,"Maybe it was the time between CD's that made my expections high but, this one did not meet them. This going to India cliche' attempt, is so old hat. I thought the sixties and sevenities were behind us. Spiritually is as likely in Boise as it is in Bombay. This is a device to make fans think that the artist has wrote or reinvented something. Most of the songs are flat and uninspiring. Front Row is noisy with out much direction. Thank U is the pop song that it was intended for, Radio. I miss the artist that sang in a flesh, honest voice, not this overly polished, over produced sophmore jinx."
5,the best album ever made! ever,"this album is far better than the first and that album is brilliant. i agree the first time i heard the album i didnt know what to think but after about 5 listenings i was hooked. songs such as Joining you ,one,front row ,baba,cant not, and i was hoping and pritty much every thing are classics.songs such as are u still mad sympathetic charictor and would not come take a long long time to get used to but when you do they rock.if you listened to it once and said you hated it listen to it again and i guarantee you will be hooked too. e mail me"
3,Repetition and overproduction ultimately weighs down this sophomore effort,"Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie extremely departs from its more structured predecessor Jagged Little Pill and successor albums Under Rug Swept and So-Called Chaos. Even though luscious Middle Eastern influences permeate the entire album, the biggest shortcoming is the lyrical content. While Alanis continues to write songs that reflect her personal and intimate struggles, the album could have benefited from some extroverted compositions. The repetitious lyrics, while honest, can become banal after a few listens--specifically in songs such as ""Are You Still Mad?"" and ""Can't Not."" Songs such as ""Baba"" and ""UR"" present a better balance between the personal and otherworldly, and showcase Alanis's talent as a songwriter."
1,Absolute Rubbish,"Bitter disappointment are the only words I can use to describe my reaction to this CD. Whilst I don't expect Alanis to carry on writing in exactly the same style as her first album, this music is written in a desparate attempt to be different. Her music makes no sense!! A few good songs like ""That I would be good"" ""buy the book"" just highlight how poor this album is!"
1,I Can't Believe I Paid...,"I liked Thank U for about the first ten listens, then I hated it. I hated all of the other songs on the disc after two listens. Anybody got any of Alanis' bubblegum pop CDs from her pre-Jagged Pill days? It's got to be better than what's on ""Junkie"".By the way, Alanis, if you're going to put a nude body in your CD, make it that of another Canadian, Pamela Anderson Lee!"
1,*Winces*,"This Cd is simply terrible music.... How disappointing after Jagged Little Pill which I consider a brilliant classic work for the ages. This so often happens after a big hit; the ""artist"" feels she is justified to offer up pretentious drivel as if initial CD success was a sign of selling out. Please bring back the passion and fire that made your warblings so memorable Alanis and forget you ever visited India and smoked up too much of the decidedly non-medicinal herbage..... A career ending work quite possibly....."
1,Wordmonger needs to get back to basics,"Jagged Little Pill was great, but since then Alanis has just churned out three albums with nothing new to offer, little inspiration, and lyrics that aren't particularly poetic or interesting and overwhelm her music with their sheer bulk. This album is one of those three."
1,Disappointed,"I have ""Jagged Little Pill"" and I love it. I played it over and over when I first bought it, but this one ...?... Whatever it has, I don't hear it. The Lyrics might be interesting as poetry, but musically, with the exception of a little something here and there, I find it boring."
3,Hmmm...,"I enjoyed this CD, but it's noticably less angry than ""Pill."" The thing that gave Alanis all her fame was the fact that she WAS angry, and no other artist really was, and her voice isn't complimented by these new songs. I admit, I liked the music, but it's not very different from a lot of other albums out there. I hope this Alanis isn't sticking around..."
2,Can I get a refund?,"I waited with great anticipation for Alanis Morissette's next CD. Her music is unlike anything else I've heard before. I was not prepared for this collection of bland drivel. I had hoped to be able to hear a sample of some other songs besides the single, ""Thank U"", but none were available on RealAudio. I think I know why."
4,Don't judge this until you've listened to it several times.,"I hated this CD the first several times I listened to it. I don't know what I was expecting but it wasn't this. So I shelved it away and almost took it to the used CD store. Then after seeing her on the Grammy's, I had the itch to listen again. I put it in my car and left it there. I realized that she was taking me on a journey of her life that I could amazingly and easily translate into my own experience. The variety of emotion, tone, and intsrutments make it sometimes unusually complex but nonetheless rewarding. I bought it for ""Thank You"" but now I skip it and move on to some of the meatier songs like ""One"" and the amazing ""Front Row""."
2,Disappointing,"Having loved JLP, I was hanging out for Alanis's second album. However, given the time and attention to detail she supposedly lavished on SFIJ, it is musically repetitive and sloppily written. What happened to the incisiveness of the first album? She need not have recreated JLP, but I think she went too far in the other direction trying to avoid doing so..."
1,An complete and utter disapointment.,"I can not believe how awful this CD was. I've already sold it back to my local record store. Maybe it wouldn't be so bad if Alanis could just manage to hit an actual note. For a while, I couldn't figure out if I was listening to a human female or a male donkey."
5,"She is a talented, beautiful artist!","Alanis Morrisette is one the most musically talented artists in this day and age. Not only does her music and lyrics change, she herself grew up too just by letting listeners actually feel what she is feeling. She is a brave, courageous women and although it very different from *jagged* it's every bit as good. I have both CD's, and depending on what type of mood I am in, there is always a song that matches my mood. At first listen, I thought it wasn't as good, but it grew on me, and some of things things she displays in her music are so, so human and natural that they make it beautiful. Yes, the music is good, but even better is the fact that she is brave enough to put out a CD that could alter her career, and obviously she doesn't mind that some fans who like (no offense to ANYONE) fake, bubblegum music will not enjoy it to it's full extent, she knows that there are deeper-feeling fans out there who will just love it, and truly relate with her."
1,"If these songs were sung on ""Saturday Nite Live,"" we'd laugh","Alanis Morissette has become an example of that strange cultural phenomena, an enormously popular superstar who is also simultaneously a perfect self-parody. I can see why her self-absorbed, self-pitying, pseudo-profound, formulaic lyrics might appeal to teenagers (especially girls) who have in their lives to date heard only a small volume of angst-filled, pretentious, ""I'm so sensitive and why doesn't the world understan' me"") pop music. But for anyone with an ounce of maturity and actual life-experience, this cd will sound more hilariously overblown and pitiful than interesting. Stay away from this one, folks."
3,Alanis Morissette: A dud?,"Without a doubt her debut album was a charm. However, her latest album SFIJ features miniscule diversity and depth. Though 17 songs are in this album, only 3 stand out. I advise you borrow the CD from the library instead. Moreover, if this was your first time ever listening to Alanis, buy her first album or CD's from Bjork and Tori....these are the women who really rock!"
5,Unique!!!,"Like a lot of people are saying, I thought the album was kind of weird the first time I listened to it. But, on the second time around, I am hopelessly hooked!!! It is so unique, intelligent, and insightful. I think she did justice to the follow up on Jagged Little Pill---the two best albums of ALL time!!!"
3,A tone-down version of Alanis,"It is proven now how good her last album, Jagged Little Pill was. The repetitious lyrics are back, but without a melody that could tame them into things of beauty. Instead, the lyrics become rather tedious from one song to the next. She does have some really great songs in the album, like the disturbing ""I Was Hoping"", for example, but as the album moves towards the end, you can't help but to think that here is another ""supposed former infatuation"" of ours that has been struggling to reclaim the wonders that they are trying to insert in the music industry."
2,A Ponderous Disappointment,"Not much to say here but this album seems to have sophomore jinx written all over it. Jagged Little Pill, and then Alanis' albums after SFIJ are truly remarkable and stand up so well to repeated listenings.However this, with the exceptions of Thank U, So Pure and Joining You, is almost like a repititious drone, unremarkable melodies to say the least, making it hard for me to reach for this CD when I want to enjoy Alanis.Completists will naturally want this and there are a handful of good tracks as I mentioned, but for all others, there is far better Morissette fare out there from which to choose."
1,Huge disappointment!,"I think ""Jagged Little Pill"" is one of the top pop albums of the last decade. So I was very eager to hear AM's newest.Unfortunately, she and her collaborator have kept what didn't work in the first album and thrown out what did work. Gone are the immensely catchy tunes, gone is the refreshing attention to lyric craft. Instead this sounds like a rambling journal of a self-obsessed 24-year-old. The CD is almost entirely devoid of rhyme, or a memorable tune, opting instead for tuneless, self-indulgent stream of consciousness yakking with the same heavy beat behind. ""Thank U"", the hit single, is the only exception. Ballard (her collaborator) is a veteran rock song composer, and ought to have known better than get swept into this ill-conceived, utterly non-musical waste of time. I just hope they can get back on the right track for her next outing.Don't bother!"
1,Boring,Amazing that the record excutives would allow this to be released. I bought it and sold it in three days. Maybe next time.
3,STILL MAD...,"We don't have much music here. We don't have much of anything. We do have a few CD's, one of which is Alanis Morrisette (""SUPPOSED FRMR INFATUATION JUNKIE""). I think it's OK. Yevgeny likes it when he is drunk. {{{{{{STARLA PARIS-----jpig. switch fr. 1. 022}}}}}}/DOD/WH"
2,typical follow up album to a top seller falls flat,"Alanis misses on this album, although I do like the nudie video she does. Only one hit on this album...a let down after the biggie one before."
3,Okay...,"I'm a big fan of Alanis Morrisette. I love all of her albums and listen to them constantly. This one would have to be the worst of all of them though.There are a few of them I like, such as ""Would Not Come,"" ""Unsent,"" ""Can't Not,"" and ""Joining You,"" but the rest just aren't very good. They're repetative and don't make a lot of sense. Her singing isn't the best on this album either.I'd still suggest buying this cd, but don't expect the wonderful music that's on her other cds."
2,Jagged Little Pill was better.,"Alanis got a little desperate to make another CD, so she didn't try very hard. I admit, Thank U is a good song though. One in every 17 Americans own Jagged Little Pill."
1,It's a waste of your money. . . Her poor career :-(,"I don't understand why she recorded this album after Jagged Little Pill did so well. . . she is a much better artist than this album proves. It depresses me to listen to this album and I, for one am dissapointed."
4,Supposed Former Infatuation Junkie,"You people oughtta be ashamed of yourselves! I don't see you out there putting out albums. I like this album.I got it for Christmas.I personally liked Jaged Little Pill better but I like this album very much as well.It is sorta on the slow side though.My 2 fav. songs are : ""Thank U"" and ""Unscent"". I think it has some similar music to the song ""Uninvited"" which I love! I like this album but the singing is a little on the Dull side. GOOD album i would say. ~Chris~"
5,Bold,"The problem with most ""pop artists"" is that they are a one trick pony--they have a successful song and then they do that same song over and over again. (E.g., how many remakes did James Taylor make of ""You've got a Friend""?)Morissette could have made another recording similar to ""Jagged Little Pill"", sold more records, made more money, etc.To her credit, she didn't. She tried something different, bold, and imaginative. She paints an in-depth, emotional, critical view of herself.The music is contorted, lyrical, imaginative. The lyrics are expressive.Buy it, simply to insure that Morisette continues her self exploration."
4,"Not as good as JLP, but I love it anyway","The pace and energy of this album is more subdued than that of JLP but still enjoy it. My favourite songs are ""Sympathetic Character"", ""Can't Not"" and ""Would Not Come""."
5,Supposed former infatuation still infatuated,"Alanis's new CD is nothing short of brilliant and masterful. I would almost venture to say that it is as good, if not better then the debut ""Jagged Little Pill"", and unlike most artists, Alanis will continue to top the charts with her second success. If I could, I'd give 5 1/2 stars to this magnetic follow-up album."
4,Alanis's Best Work,"This amazing CD had the misfortune of being the follow up CD to Alanis Morissette's classic ""Jagged Little Pill"". It is unfortunate because the two CD's sound nothing alike.SFIJ is one of those CD's that I consider to be ahead-of-it's-time. The production by Glen Ballard is amazing and, imo, superior to the work he did on JLP. The Eastern sounds - especially the guitars are hypnotic and work so well with Alanis's lyrics.Hopefully SFIJ will be re-released and re-mastered one day (for it's 10th anniversary perhaps?) as it is the essential CD if you are an Alanis fan...start with JLP if you are a newcomer then come to this. It's one of those few CDs that you can play in years to come and always discover something new.Essential songs:BabaAre You Still MadSympathetic CharacterThe CouchCan't NotI Was HopingOneJoining You"
4,I enjoyed Copper Sun!,"Copper Sun was the second of three Sharon Draper novels that I read for a Young Adult Literature class that I am taking. I liked the story. If I hadn't read so many books that were just like it, then I would probably love the story. From the very beginning of Copper Sun, I felt that it was formulaic and very similar to books that I have read before it, such as Obi, or the History of Three-Fingered Jack, Roots, or Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl. As a result of that observation, I continued to read the novel cautiously. I was surprised to see that Sharon Draper went her own way with this story and focused on themes of feminism, motherhood, and faith against seemingly insurmountable odds. I would definitely use this novel as a fictional accompaniment to lessons on slavery and the Middle Passage with an older group of students."
5,What dynamic translation is for,"By completely breaking with tradition Gaus manages to preserve the meaning of the Greek. I am continually frustrated by how bad most translations are. Bible translation has a 1600 year history that quite often works as a weight more than buoy. The New Testament is a Greek first century book written for other first century people about first century topics. Most bibles aim to ""close the gap"" obliterating the Greekness of the NT, including dynamic translations. Gaus doesn't. Gaus shows you what you read if you read Greek fluently. The books read wonderfully smoothly since there is no attempt at maintaining any semblance of formal translation. At the same time preserving the mysticism, philosophy and theology of the underlying Greek better than any bible I know of. He accomplishes exactly what dynamic translation aims for. There aren't many reviews on the web but google books has half of it online."
4,Awesome screen & super quiet!,"i love my new elite screen as much as i love the mustang version we have at the club! it's super quiet when putting the screen up or down, and the remote works very well. the 16:9 format rocks and looks gorgeous and bright paired up with my nec vt800. my ONLY complaint, and why i gave it 4 out of 5 stars [i would've given it 4.5 if i were able] is that the power cable is too short to reach down to the plug. we have it mounted to the ceiling and had the power cable been another 2ft longer, we could actually plug it into the wall outlet w/o needing an extension cable. elite makes great products, and this screen is no exception! my only other issue is that amazon doesn't offer it in white, which it should, as it blends in a lot easier with most home theater ceilings, which are usually painted white. the black just makes it stand out a bit more than we'd like. either way, this screen rocks!!!"
1,Non-Functioning screen???,Bought this screen and it didn't turn on or work with remote. Took the company 3 weeks to send me a replacement circuit board that I had to install and still didn't work. It's been over a month since I bought this screen and am still waiting for a replacement. Don't waste your time with this crappy company. I only paid $200 w/ free shipping and wish I had never purchased it. Beware!
4,Great budget screen,"This is a very nice 125"" screen. Screen come down a bit slow but is very quiet. The screen as started curling on both sides but its not distracting. Other then that I'm very happy. I was a nice upgrade in pq over my wall :)."
1,"Your Kidding, Right?","Most of the other reviewers got it right. Not only did the cover for the seat back not cover the back, it did not cover the front completely either. At least 4 inches of the seat back still shows below the cover on my 77 GMC. There are not enough ties in the box to put the cover securely on the seat or the seat back. The ones that are attached gave the feel the one should not pull them to tightly for fear of ripping the fabric. One of the most dissapointing products I have ever bought on Amazon. Auto Expressions needs to make it clear this product is not as much as advertised."
1,"Disappointing, Sappy","I was expecting so much more. It should have been a great book. The two main characters did have a lot of thought and feeling to them but it took over half the book to get them together. The first half she was trying for tension, but they only had a few conversations and not very long at that. When they did get together it was over done. They were instantly in love , as though they had been for quite a while. And the way they then spoke to one another. Darling this dearest that. It just didn't feel right. Mostly because there wasn't much interaction between them before they got together. I think the story itself was interesting in the fact there was a little mystery. Who the ghost was and who stole the jewels. Over all not a good book. Boring"
4,worth the time but.....,"I enjoyed Berman's book, but I did not find his conclusions to be particularly original or insightful. It is, however, worth one's time to read and ponder. He is yet another voice reminding us that things are not as they should be."
3,Twilight of American Culture,"I found Berman's book entertaining and thought-provoking for the most part, with the following reservations:1.His persistent use of two-dollar words was pretentious and irritating. I don't think this necessarily enhanced his getting the point across, since even an illiterate knows we are going to hell in a handbasket.2. The same goes for his quoting a vast number of sources. This only means he has read a few books, and constitutes name dropping, which does not serve any useful purpose.3. By his own definition, Berman is not an NMI but presumes to know that NMIs are the salvation of McWorld.4. Berman should invest in a good spell checker."
4,I usually read a lot of nonfiction--memoirs but..,This book was discussed on either Public Radio or Oprah had the author on to discuss this book--I can't remember. I read this book all in one day. It is a collection of stories that aren't very long but the characters have depth which allows the reader to feel like you have read a short book after each story. I shared this book with my Mom and my really good friend and they agree; it is a very good book.
3,it's ok...,"Wasn't what I hoped. As a devotee of Isis, I was disappointed to see that this book barely mentioned the Knot of Isis, which is a shame because the Knot of Isis is such a huge part of Egyptian magic and religion. There seems to be more stories and myths behind the charms and spells in here rather than the actual application. There's also not that much on ritual, which is another big part of Egyptian magic and religion. I think what bothered me most was the reference to crystals for healing, which seems too New Ageish."
4,great deal,"Sleek look to case and good camera protection. Just what I wass looking for. Like the idea of the slot for camera strap in case cover, but it's awkward to use for quick access situations. However it is just as easy to let the strap hang out from side of cover for when you need to get that quick , not to miss shot. Kit is excellent deal for the money!"
5,accessory,"Glad I ordered the accessory pack with the camera. Nice case, and the second battery will assure I always have power."
3,What about the reporter?,"I love Michael Connelly books and I love Harry Bosch, but I read this book straight after ""The Poet"" and I really didn't enjoy it as much. I felt that I had invested something in the reporter and his role. Why wasn't Backus at all interested in him after he played such a vital role the first time around and was even one of the intended victims? I love Harry, but would have preferred seeing Jack back on the case. I think the dynamic between him and Rachel could have been pretty interesting. He is hardly mentioned in this book and in my opinion he played a greater role in discovering the poet than anyone. Wouldn't he have any vested interest in this at all?"
4,Another good one and a great sequel,"Usually sequels are not great, this one was really really good. Read through it in 4 days on the train.....Harry Bosch is a great character and Rachel Walling just adds to the whole story....."
4,In pursuit of a serial killer,"This thriller includes several whodunnits because of a number of murder victims. All are connected to the Poet, a serial killer. The intensity is there though the protagonists don't come too close to danger except for one particular point. There are touching moments Bosch has with his daughter. A good thriller."
5,Harry Bosch,My title says it all. I love all the Harry Bosch novels. I'm in the process of reading all of them.
1,It doesn't get any more pedestrian than this.,"""I am also rereading ""Gorky Park"" and the contrast, at every level, is cruel to Mr. Connelly.""Couldn't have said it better. After reading Le Carre and Patrick O'Brian, I got halfway through this carelessly dictated story filled with highly unlikable characters. At least somebody lent it to me and I'm not out the money, hah hah!As to the five star reviews posted below, I have to draw the conclusion that these are plants by the author or the publisher, because ain't nobody that dumb as to give this tripe five stars who isn't getting paid."
2,Nothing original here,"Do yourself a favor. Buy a used copy or better yet get it from the library.This is thoroughly middle of the road stuff. I am really getting tired of the ""cop gone bad"" angle that he is now putting in all of his Bosch books. He needs a new schtick, already!But it is well written. I will give him that. It is quite readable but also quite forgettable."
4,Harry Bosch,"I just recently started reading Michael Connelly and I like the character of Harry Bosch. Harry solves the crimes with his mind and research. I also enjoyed Trunk Music, Lost Light, and The Poet. I am currently reading The Black Echo and like it very much."
4,The Narrows,Michael Connolly's books are always great. The Narrows was another of his success's. He introduces his characters in a way that you feel you've known them for awhile. I recommend his books to all my friends. Amazon has a supply of every one of his writings. I have purchased and read 20 of Connolly's books .
2,Crazy pet hair dryer,Would not recommend. The dryer doesn't have enough power. Stand works with my regular hair dryer.
4,Corporate Thriller,"This is an excellent business book&#65533;part personality profile, part corporate history and part industry analysis. It&#65533;s the story of the rise of the discount brokerage industry as created by Charles Schwab and the mavericks who worked for his eponymous company. It&#65533;s a fascinating story filled with interesting characters and more twists and turns than the latest Patterson thriller. Along the way, it delivers some worthwhile commentary about management and leadership and how companies rise and fall. Kador bases his narrative on pre-published sources, then livens it up with quotes and anecdotes from a large number of sources. The result is an easy-to-read (and occasionally humorous) book that just about succeeds in providing a &#65533;fly on the wall&#65533; record of the inside politics and personalities of the firm."
3,Not what I expected,"I bought this book expecting what the book description said: ""7 all new stories"". That is not the case. The book is a compilation of Sasami stories (about 4 of them) that were done in the No Need for Tenchi series. The only thing new about this book is at the end where they featured comic strips that the author drew for a fan club newsletter for many years that were not released to the public before. These strips were basically a marketing ploy and have no contribution to the story of Tenchi at all. I do not suggest this book to someone who already collected the No Need for Tenchi stories. This book is good for someone who is a Sasami fan, or wishes to have all works done by this author."
4,"I love you, a bushel and a PECK",Good collection. Well presented. Couple of films got bum raps in other reviews. Didn't see their displeasure. This is well-recommended - especially if you don't already have some of the other titles.
1,So bad it's dishonest,"As the reviewer Charles points out (in his many identical reviews) the French in Québec is a dialect of French so you'd expect most words in this book to be French words. I agree 100% BUT when you call a book a Quebecois (sic!) dictionary, you would expect to also find some of the words that are used in Québec. In this book, you don't. I've lived in Québec for a long time and was eager to have a look at this book. To my surprise, it didn't contain any of the words I looked up - I'm talking about the most common, everyday words of every kind. I didn't find a single one of them. This is just a substandard French dictionary that Hippocrene tries to pass off as something it isn't. If you want to buy a French dictionary, there are literally hundreds of better options. If you're intrested in Québec French, look for the books ""Speak Québec"" or ""Canadian French"". They are everything this book isn't"
1,Garbage,"Actually, calling this collection of nonsense ""garbage"" is an insult to garbage. At least most garbage was of some use to someone before it became garbage. But books like this have never done anyone any good, aren't doing anyone any good now, and never will do anyone any good."
2,Surprised & Disappointed,My first order for the product which i received was well packed and had plenty of whole product at the bottom of the bag. This new shipment of the same product had product dust and a few granules at the bottom of the bag. I understand that in packaging there would be a certain amount of settling of the product at the bottom of the bag but what i received was almost 2 inches of product dust and small granules. Either this is a packaging malfunction or a quality review lapse. At the price i paid for it there should be enough whole product at the bottom of the bag as there is at the top.
2,Cracked,"Beware. This is a nice crock pot, but the ceramic insert cracked after the second time of use. I called the rival, it is under warranty and are very helpful. BUT, do you want to have to deal with it? Not sure if it is worth it or not!"
3,Not a bad PVR card.,"This review isn't at all authoritative, but it may be helpful for some people. The card itself performs exactly as it ought to, but I confess I wasn't aware that it was designed specifically for WinXP's Media Center Edition.Not having this edition on my computer, I installed the open-source project Media Portal and it behaved fine.Be aware that that the card comes with NO software, since WinXP MCE has everything needed for the card. If you go my route, you'll need to follow directions and install the right software off the web."
2,Similar to Fiorentina journal refills but lesser quality,"I purchased a good number of these journals at one time to use in my Fiorentina journal. When they arrived, I noticed that they are a little smaller than the Fiorentina refills which is okay. However, the paper is thinner and is of lesser quality, the bookmark is taped to the spine (instead of glued), and the binding is glued instead of sewed which means it splits open when you press the book down to write on it.Overall, I would not reorder this product or recommend it for the reasons above. I recommend paying a little more for better refills for your journal."
3,No hole for a straw!,While the mug is big (which I wanted for my iced coffee in the morning) there is no hole which would allow me to insert a straw for tidier sipping!! Bummer.
1,NOT Grandtec Longranger BEWARE - fake,This is NOT the Grandtec Longranger keyboard. DSI are shipping a budget alternative and advertising it as the Grandtec branded Longranger. The cheap alternative no name brand does not have the same Enter key. I returned to Amazon and informed them but they are still advertising it. Shameful.
1,Audiovox DVD Player,"The Audiovox Portable DVD Player performed very well for the first 15 times it was used, but ceased working and can't be repaired, so the product was a diapointment over the long haul."
2,Boring and Predictable,"Although [Amazon.com's] recommendations are usually right on target, I was very disappointed in this book. I forced myself to read it right through...I kept hoping it would get better...but it never did. I have no idea why I was recommended this book and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone!"
2,Missing RF Reciever,"I PURCHASED WHAT I THOUGHT WAS A NEW UNOPENED WIRELESS KEYBOARD/MOUSE COMBO AS A GIFT FOR MY STUDENT, (WHO WAS DISAPPOINTED). I Opened box and found just the keyboard no RF Receiver or mouse, although an extra box with a wireless mouse was added. HOW CAN I use this keyboard with out the RECEIVER????"
4,Purty Good for some Yankees,"Strong stuff. Honest roots country. It's a shame pop stars like Shania Twain and Brian White can sell 10 million albums, and the 'Dogs can't even get a major label!!!"
1,Audubon's Animal Adventures: Parrot - Propaganda Boloni,I bought this tape to watch parrots in the wild. What I got was five minutes of parrots and twenty three minutes of environmentalist propaganda.
5,I am impressed heartily .,"Some first impressions were quiet.However, it was imaginary fears.Emotion increases whenever I listen.I understood that it was the best album which Vikki sang in English.I think that this CD is good for one of the collection of her fan."
5,Kids learn Gujarati,I really like this DVD and its good for beginners. My 4 yrs old daughter wants me to put this on quite often and it makes me feel good that she is interested in learning her mother tongue.
3,FOR OUR FINE FEATHERED FRIENDS,"This serious anthology of 23 soft-as-down poems about birds by such authors as Eleanor Farjeon, Carl Sandburg and Edward Lear is no feather-weight compendium. As you'd likely guess, it includes Williams Sargent's ""The Barn-Swallow,"" Sandburg's ""Look at Six Eggs,"" and an excerpt from Lear's ""The Pelican Chorus."" Contemporary, award winning poets are also represented -- Kristine O'Connell George for instance, who contributes a pair of stanzas about a parakeet -- but most entries are culled from well-worn traditional verses and anonymous standbys (most notably the kid-friendly ""The Parrot"")."
3,Tiny!,"I expected this wonderful little piece of desk swag to be a bit bigger than it was, but the whole thing fits in the palm of your hand! Other than this, the product is fun and durable. DO NOT KEEP THIS ANYWHERE YOUNG CHILDREN CAN GET TO IT! The brightly colored, cartoon-ish pieces may be confused with candy by the very young and are small and made of fairly sharp metal. Caveat Emptor."
1,Overheating,"The thing overheats and shuts off. And is not the computer fault. Maybe the one I got was defective but this was the experience:Computer has been on for a while: cold card is inserted: It works but after some minutes it shuts off. It is removed and check for temperature and is burning hot. No point of the computer is as hot.Computer just turned on, computer fan not even working (the computer is still very cool). Card inserted and after some minutes (similar to previous instance) stops working. Removed, and is burning hot again.Some other reports of overheating problem are found on the internet.HOWEVER, the seller has an outstanding system for returning the article. So if you are really interested you can try your luck."
3,Works fine... With one catch!,"This card does what it says, and it does it well. The image is quite good, it is really easy to setup, and the bundled program really has some very good features.There is a catch though, on my Dell Inspiron 6000, plugging this card causes the speakers to continuously generate static noise! This happens either if you are watching TV or not! Just plug the card, and the static noise starts automatically! So, I have to remove the card from the laptop every time I want to listen to something else, which gets really annoying.I am not sure if this happens with other laptops, but if you have an Dell Inspiron... beware!"
2,Complicated,"I bought this book for an upcoming trip to Romania. It advertises itself as a grammar book, dictionary and phrase book.The grammar section is overly complicated and not at all well-laid out. I became so frustrated that I could barely make my way through the section.The dictionary part seems adequate.The phrase section is handy but there are no pronounciation guides. The pronounciation was laid out in the beginning of the book, but I kept having to refer back which was annoying. Still, I am unsure of most of the pronounciation.I got the feeling that this was based off of British guide book models from the 1960s. Very proper, overly complicated and not very well-laid out."
1,"Romanian English, English Romanian Dictionary",DID NOT help me learn any Romanian expressions of any importance! Will keep searching.
5,A suspense thriller with a fun side,"This mystery novel successfully weaves its suspenseful tale, but the author also creates characters and settings that lend an element of satire and make this a fun read. The insights into the worlds of finance and journalism add to the story without overwhelming the reader, and the New York City lives of the characters, at both the upper crust and workingman's level, are fascinating."
2,one word---HOAX,"An entertaining read, although the title of my review sums up my feelings on the material."
3,"Snugli pack is ""ok""","The snugli pack is ""middle of the road"" - we didn't want to spend a couple hundred dollars on a nicer pack - however, you get what you pay for. we've borrowed a kelty pack before and it was great! adjustments were easy and could get the pack comfortable. On the Snugli, the baby seems a little too close to the back of your head. This pack is rated for up to 40 lbs, but after a month and a half of use with our 22 lb, 9 month old son, one of the shoulder straps tore and was litterally hanging by a thread. The company offered to reimburse the money, however they couldn't replace the pack directly as they no longer make it. We'd have to send back the first pack before getting reimbursed. Overall, we aren't thrilled with this pack, but it's handy for short hikes."
1,Cut My Baby's Face,"My husband and I purchased two of these carriers for a backpacking excursion we were taking with our 7 month old twins. Not 5 minutes into our walk I looked over at my son and was horrified to see blood running down his cheek. The sunshade attachment, which is made of highly abrasive materials, was rubbing on his face and made 3 one inch long scratches. I would for obvious safety concerns not recommend this product to anyone. It is down right dangerous!"
2,unhappy in ohio,"I was so excited about getting this back pack after reading the reviews...and utterly disappointed after purchasing it. Although my one year old (24 lb) son enjoyed it, it was very uncomfortable to wear. The weight was mostly distributed on my shoulders and it gave me muscle tension headaches after prolonged use. This may be good for short trips, but I wouldn't recommend it for hikes longer than a couple of miles."
1,HORRIBLE BACKPACK,"I bought this for my son who is almost 1 year old. I ended up returning it 3 days later. I am a petite woman (5'2"") and this item was totally uncomfortable! I still have bruises under my arms from this item. I followed all directions and no matter what could not get it properly positioned as shown in the pictures of the manual. It bounced on my back and the straps dug into my armpits. I would NOT reccomend this item for anyone who is as petite as I am. NOT WORTH THE MONEY"
3,Packaging Left Something to be Desired,"The box contains the whole kit including a single cleaning canister. The canister was not encased in any way, not even in a zip lock bag. As a result, when we opened the package the blue cleanser colorant was all over the inside of the box. What a mess! Clean up was a pain in the posterior."
2,Blue not Bleach,This is not the same product as the Flush n'Sparkle Bleach. Do not mistake it for such. It does not do nearly the job and does not last very long. Don't buy it. Go for the Bleach product. By contrast the Flush n'Sparkle Bleach is absolutely awesome and can not be beat.
4,"Excellent, With Reservations","I like this book very much. The layout is easy to read and understand.My only reservation is that it leaves out some commonly used herbs, and it has not been updated at all since 1995.This is my second copy, hopefully this spiral bound one will fare better than the bound one I bought in 1995 that is ready to fall apart due to subpar construction.I recommend the book. I look at it as a supplemental book though...... as it's not complete."
4,Works with Sony products right out of the box.,"Not many features on the remote, but I have been searching for a remote for my LocationFree TV (X1). This works great."
3,Baaa Baaa,The seat wrap is nice but is defective. The two straps at front and back of the seat are missing. Also the elastic straps at the top of the back would not allow my seat belt to function properly since the belt is attached to the corner of the seat. Rather than take a couple of weeks for return/replacement I modified it myself. First cut the elastic strap and plaed it under the seat belt and simply re-tied it in a knot. Next poked holes in the wrap inside the edge binding and placed strings behind the seat and under the front of the seat. Works fine so far. The cloth seats on my GMC pickup were hard to slide my butt on so the sheep skin makes it easier to get in and out.
1,My first Amazon return...,"I used to have a sheepskin in my Civic, which I bought from Costco. I really liked it! I had it for about 5 or 6 years, until it got soaked and ruined. I went without for a few years. Then I decided to get another one, thinking it would make long drives more comfortable. Costco no longer sells them, so I went looking.I bought this one hoping it would work as well. Needless to say, it didn't work out for me. First, let me tell you the good:-It seemed well enough constructed-I could not tell where one section of skin patched into another-The fur was reasonably thick-The cover only moved around a little, mainly when getting in/outHere's why I returned it:-It smelled-It itched, even through a thick cotton shirtMy previous sheepskin did not ever itch. It only felt soft and comfy. This one felt coarse- like there were goat hairs amongst the sheepskin fur. It clearly was not made of the same kind of sheepskin I had before.I hope this helps."
3,Lake Effects,"Lake Effects is a video to watch on an evening spent at home. It reminds me of a made-for-tv family movie. We enjoyed the movie, but probably would not watch it twice. It did entertain for the evening which is all it promised to do. I recommend that you give it a try.Lake Effects"
1,Not the Real Deal,I was really happy when I first discovered this CD. I was happy at the number of songs and the whole package itself and really wanted to like this CD. However when I finally popped in the CD I was so disappointed to find out that this some sort of tribute CD and none of the Songs are actually sung by Lola Beltran. I hate it when they do that! There is no where on the outside of this CD that warns that Lola Beltran's voice is not included in this CD. If you are looking to actually hear Lola's great voice I would suggest to look elsewhere.
4,Good for Boys!,"My son purchased Cube World and loves them! They're great for boys because the stick figures pass gas and throw up. Boys really love that stuff. His little sisters have put them through the ringer (dropping them and throwing them) and they're still working fine. He took them to school and the other boys went wild. It would be great if they were in the stores, S/H is costly."
3,A Great Time Waster!!,"I bought this for my daughter, who is autistic. She spent about three minutes with it, and will come back to it occasionally. What I found is that you don't really play with it, you just set it to different positions to see what the little stick figures do, and sometimes there is a surprise. It is too slow for the average kid, but if you are a procrastinator like me there is no problem putting this on your desk and being amused until inspiration hits. The only drawback is the price. I am tempted, however, to get a few more blocks to see how they interact."
2,Cube World,"I do not currently own one - had to list reviews tho. According to a magazine article, it sounded interesting. However, after seeing the graphics, I don't think I would pay the amount they're asking. It would probably get boring after a week or so, just like the other ""virtual pet/people"". If the graphics were better, I might consider it. Best part of magazine review was ""Shake or turn the cubes and the stick figures fall down, stagger and get sick"". That's something new..."
2,"Case got new style, pictures become old.",I received the case that's not like in the picture show. Called them up and they found out the manufacture has recently change the style of that model (urgly enough to me). They apologized for the pictures. I got full refund.
2,"If you already own Xmen, dont waste your money","1.5 has some extra features that the original did not have like behind the scenes and deleted scenes, but not worth buying the movie again. There is only about 5 minutes of deleted scenes that it is obvious why they deleted, and the behind the scenes is almost strictly boring interviews you would not want to watch more than onces. If you dont own xmen, definately get this movie, but if you already own, don't bother, you arent missing much"
2,"""X-Men""","Bryan Singer aims for the mutant heart, and misses. His mistakes begin at the tone: he places the cartoon heroes into a hyper-realistic setting, and it suffocates them. Stripped of its fantasy, the film tries to tell the most story with the least possible activity, and the result is forced, hurried, and often difficult to swallow (the newscasters always drop major plot points at the perfect moments). The cast is lost without Hugh Jackman: he's wound tight enough to snap, yet his eyes convey a sensitivity he tries to repress. The rest of the cast is mostly scenery, particularly the curiously silent villains, and Halle Berry's Storm is a testament to bad casting. The film has the feel (and look) of a TV pilot, telling the first chapter and nothing else, and marred greatly by poor effects and a letdown ending. If nothing else, we leave the film feeling the filmmakers were only half-trying. Features Anna Paquin, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, and a miles-away Famke Janssen."
3,"Great movie, DVD overrated","When i was a kid, I always the cartoon saturday mornings. However, this movie is just as good, maybe better, if you haven't. Every character is introduced in its own unique way, which makes it exciting from the start. The movie is a step-up from Saturday morning cartoons in that the mutants are much more realistic and the mood is darker, so it's easier to take seriously. The story itself is brilliant. The special features leave much to be desired. There's nothing but a few clips of behind the scenes footage and so-called deleted scenes that are just longer versions of existing ones. It gets really annoying to play them as the movie goes along, because you see several parts twice in a row. Normally, i'm not as picky about features, but there was an endless row of commercials saying how great the DVD was. If I had to guess, I'd say that there's nothing here you can't get in the original."
1,How sad.,"One must have quite the ego to think that one's life is interesting enough to document. Seems that Ms.Block has just that. The ""insights"" and ""revelations,"" as well as the cliched little lessons make me feel sad for her. There is nothing worth reading here."
5,Very Insprirational,"This was one of the best books I have read in a long time. We all watched and listened as this story unfolded and was horrified. Through Kristen Stagg, Jim was able to tell the story, help us to see it through his eyes, and know how true forgiveness can feel. Very, Very Good...."
5,Bigger then i thought,this is bigger then i thought. the color was bright and nice. its rather durable. it is easy to clip onto things.
5,Important writing,"As the family of man continues to polarize into haves and have-nots we must learn to change the way we mitigate the disasters of others or we shall certainly all fail victim the global crisis that is known as 'overpopulation.' This book gives what must be an overview of the end of todays chaotic international relief efforts, because if this system is not ended, then heaven help us.... An important book, I wish every member of Congress, every person with a charitable thought, and every man who knows that there for the grace go I, should read and reflect on this book."
1,Way to hot and heavy,".. These warms-ups look good and when you first put them on they feel good.After a while though they get hot, cling to your leg and flat out become unwearable. I was hoping to like this product. Its just isnt worth the price or resources it takes to get them to your house or business."
5,Great stuff,"I had purchased a bag of Bear Naked's Apple Cinnamon Granola at my local grocery store about a year ago. Ever since then, I could not find the Apple-Cin flavor anywhere. I then checked Amazon and found it. This stuff is great. It can be eaten right out of the bag; as a cereal; or added into other foods. I find Bear Naked to have an excellent selection of fresh and great tasting granola's; but the Apple-Cin is my favorite. Since I can never find it on the local grocery store shelves, I assume others have the same opinion."
1,"Weak, rather feeble performances","Anyone interested in these fine scores is advised to buy the far superior performance of Treasure of the Sierra Madre on Naxos label, and to wait for the upcoming re-recording of Charge of the Light Brigade on the Tribute Classics label (I've heard pre-release clips of the latter and it promises to be an exceptional disc).The recordings on the Centaur disc are a couple of the flattest and most uninspired performances of Steiner works I've ever heard."
2,Boring!,"That's pretty much all I can say about this book. It was super BORING!I listened to the audio version of this book and the reader had a really annoying monotone voice. That could be why I didn't like it as much. The story line seems like it would be much more interesting. It was painfully obvious from the beginning who the killer was. Although the ""why"" was a mystery until the end."
3,Was pretty good,I liked this book but not as much as the Stephanie Plum mysteries. Characters were just not as humorous. still worth a read.
4,"Magnet good, rack hook bad",I bought this based on the Cook's Illustrated review. The first thing I noticed is the hanging hook doesn't fit the heavy racks in our Viking oven. Fortunately the magnet mount works well and I stuck it on the back wall of the oven under the light. The third mounting method is a flip down wire stand. I haven't tried this but it seems like it will be fine for a flat surface like a cookie sheet or pizza stone.Aside from mounting issues the thermometer seems functional. I'd prefer a bigger more readable model that I can read through the oven window.
4,"Big Dogs, Little Dogs","I got what I was after. The dvd basically gives you a run down on dogs in general. It doesn't really aim to get specific about all breeds, but it was great for those who want to know about dogs as I did. I was really satisfied."
3,love this,"we loved the shelf when it arrived!! it was exactly what we were looking for o hang in the living room. it was a bit hard to hang straight, but we got it done. the only problem was one of the shelves broke but a little wood glue and ypu cant even notice."
5,Beautiful,"The shelves arrived packaged very well, were very easy to assemble, and look absolutely fantastic on my son's bedroom wall. We are very pleased with the quality and the look."
5,Great Shelf,"This shelf was a life saver, I bought a new TV and had no room for all the extra boxes ie. cable, stereo, apple tv. This shelf puts it all together and safely holds all with no problem."
5,The Applause would be a wonderful guitar at twice the price,"This is a great guitar. I bought one for my girlfriend, as she had an Applause when she was a kid and thought it was the greatest thing since steel strings. It has to be one of the easiest acoustics to play (slim neck, easy action), and the sound is very nice. Quality and finish are unbelievably good for a guitar of this price. It even stays in tune. I enjoy playing the Applause as much as my Yamaha that cost more than twice as much."
3,Very light material!,very light material and bad sizing. I order an M and it seem it was better an Xl.
5,Engrossing and exciting,"I found this a somewhat more accessible book than Revelation Space. The focus is less on redemption and more on survival, with an intriguing backstory, exciting action, and a fascinating cast of characters. Despite some comments by other reviewers that they found the climax a confusing letdown, I thought it was actually well-conceived, well-plotted, and well-written. I won't spoil the surprise though..."
4,cloak and twisted dagger,"Truthfully, I was only reading this one for completeness after finishing the RS trilogy. I never expected to like some sort of ""cloak and dagger"" story set on another planet. But this was surprisingly an engaging, good read. It sheds some light on this universe that I wish I had when I began Revelation Space, and for this reason I might recommend starting with Chasm City before the trilogy.One problem I have with Reynolds is that sometimes a character is just too diabolical and has too many layers of twisted flaws. This is one thing that pushes past the usual realism you feel in his stories."
3,A fall from grace..almost,"I thoroughly enjoyed Revelation Space and was excited when this book, set in the same universe, came out. The book started out incredibly slow. I understand that it takes time to set up the plot, but come on. If it wasn't for the fact that I loved his first book I might have stopped reading this one after the first 200 pages. I was beginning to wonder if Mr. Reynolds was going to be a one hit wonder. Well the final 200 pages made up for the first 200. The action/plot moved much quicker which made for easy reading. I stayed up late to finish the last 50 pages, which the sign of a good ending. I gave this book 3 stars and the strong finish will probably convince me to read the next offering in this series. RFM"
3,"Great concepts, dud ending","Reynolds certainly has the talent to play in the hard SF field, but this is another author that has succumbed to the ""milk it"" mentality (ie. Orson Scott Card, et al). The ending was purposefully left nebulous and open to allow yet another trist in his universe...in addition to Chasm City. As another reviewer stated below, what has happened to the days when authors could give us 200-300 page works of art instead of bloated prose that allows publishers to eat up entire rows of shelf space with ""Yet another rousing tale from the Blah universe!"" Now, once again, I will be force to load down my bookshelf to find out what happens to Volyova, Khouri, and the Captain when it should have been closed in this novel."
5,Great Story!,"I ADORE Alastair Reynolds! His Revelation Space series is amazing and a great science fiction series. If you love science fiction, then definitely check out his stuff. They are increadibly long which is great cuz you won't get to the end of the book thinking ""but I just started to get into this"" but not too long that you are thinking ""sheesh, they could have cut out pages and pages of that and it would have been better"". This is great, READ THIS BOOK and all his others!!"
2,Almost Decent,"The design and sight of this baby are awesome. The battery life is also incredibly awesome. Yet it pains me to have to listen to the same mp3's over and over and over and over (you get the point) again. 32 mb is patheticly pathetic. You will like it for a month and then disregard as some type of trophy of technology. If you want something you could really use and teasure I would reccomend the Archos Jukebox Recorder. (6000 mb vs. 32mb)Just my $ 0.02KaiWhatever is not nailed down, is mine.Whatever I can pry loose... is not nailed down!"
1,Smartmedia won't fit???,64 meg Smartmedia card will not fit in the player. I tried 8 & 64 meg and they are 3.3v. Can someone help???
4,good equibment.. but,"Sorry,, poor batteries door,,I don't like the way I have to push the small door to get the batteries fixed in their place,,And the door doesn't look stable at all, that's why Sumsung give you another extra door,, After got it,, I look around the player and feel like it doesn't strong enough,, the plastic body doesn't give a solid feeling at all,,,,,Over all, the product is very easy to use, beside my fuji finepix 4700 that operate with smart media, this tiny player is a very compatible,, I don't have to buy an extra smar media, and if you want to use only the smart media,, you actually don't have to install this player in your computer,, (If you have a card reader, just drag the mp3 files in smart media card, that will be fine).. I give this 4 points becouse the body and the batteries door are poorly build,,"
3,"transfer rate is slow, cheap battery cover, ok otherwise","saw the price thought it was great. got it with 64 mb of memory (viking). It's definitely great for working out. HOwever, I've had the same set of tunes on this thing since I bought it 2 months ago because the transfer rate is so slow. Kind of irritating but it could also be because I'm impatient. I guess it takes about 20 minutes or so to transfer all the songs I want. Would suggest buying it for the price but perhpas if you've got the cash, get one of those iPods--more memory and probably much faster transfer."
2,poorest mp3 player I tried,"bought this one to replace broken rio500, because it was really cheap ($30 after coupon). I didn't expected anyting, and I was right. So much worse than rio500! The only good thing I can say about this one is that it is really light, even if bulky. The upload speed is about that of serial cable and there are no features at all. The worst thing (ok, I knew about this one) is that it doesn't take 128MB SM cards. Besides, the card compartment doesn't close, so the card is always a bit exposed. My experience with Samsung products was typically good, but this player doesn't feel very sturdy."
2,Not for running,"I'll agree that this mp3 player is a great value, but if you want to use it to run, don't bother. The belt clip is worthless. Even though the Yepp is very light, it bounced around so much I ended up either putting it on the treadmill or carrying it. The remote control is also useless. I could never tell which was the equalizer button and which was the fast forward so I would have to bring it up close to see which I think defeats the purpose. I'll be purchasing the Nike mp3 player next time."
3,"transfer PC to player slow, application tends to crash often","The big advantage od this player is its price. I've been using it for 3 months now, and I think that the sound quality is ok (I am not very demanding). Buttons and controls are functional. Wires often get all messed up when I carry it in my bag, making them effectively very short (the alternative is to spend one minute or two uncluttering them every time). The biggest problem I have with this player is that it's difficult to transfer mp3 files from my PC to the player. I find the transfer to be slow, which makes it impractical for every day usage. Furthermore, the application that comes on the cd together with the player (RealPlayer Jukebox) crashes virtually every time on my Windows 98 PC. I know that Win 98 are not so common nowadays any more, but the product is declared to work under Win 98, so it should work. What I am doing now is just trying multiple times, and eventually I am able to do it, but it takes time and patience."
1,June Cleaver is Dead,"This book gives an unrealistic portrayal of what love is. Most of the suggestions Chapin gives make it sound like the woman should be a slave to the man. Your husband is supposed to be your friend and someone you can be comfortable and open with, not someone you have to constatly worry about impressing. Overall, I did not agree with the message that this book presented."
2,Where did the ideas come from?,"This book is subpar when compared to Ambrose's Superstition (which is exellent). While reading the book three movies kept jumping out at me. Don't get me wrong I like these movies but I do not like the similiarities between them and the book. The movies are the Matrix, The 13th floor and Fight Club."
4,A comprable gpu to a ati 9700 pro,This card gave my ibm a50 workstation some added life to power my intel i865g chipset motherboardOverall the card gave me a boost throughtout the use of this pc
5,Incredible product,"Quality was great. Worked at home and at the office. I use if for fun and for work. Our factory and warehouse are in different parts of the country and the world. Voice recognition was really cool, and it understood me, I was suprised :)I would really recommend this product. It is fun and saves a lot of money cos its free service."
3,Good book for photos of what the area looked like but...,"The historical content is a touch light. The captions of the photos give the reader a wealth of detail about the locations and operations in the images but there could have been a lot more done on the history of this section of the B&O.; The Great Strike of 1877 that started in Martinsburg, WV gets far too little coverage.Having said that, it is a good picture book and full of interesting trivia, but if you're looking for a lengthy historical narrative, well that book hasn't been written yet."
3,Most Wonderful Dollhouse Book by Millie Hines,"Its a very old book with very old ideas, but had a couple of cutesmall dolls/animals to make. I bought it mainly for the one bearthat is in it (pattern and all). The price was right, and I am notsorry I purchased it."
5,A Non-Supply Chain Manager's Guide to Supply Chains,"I needed to get up to speed quickly on Supply Chains as I have now taken on management duties for an area that includes transport, shipping, etc. With no background (I come from marketing) the discussions seemed like an alien language and I felt I couldn't be effective, and worse, couldn't tell if what I was hearing was valid or excuses.This book introduced me to the topic and helped me understand the key issues quickly. I still am not an expert on the field, but feel capable of following the issues and bringing judgement to the decisions I must make.Overall, I would rate this book as an excellent way to parachute into a new subject and quickly learn the lay of the land. I feel that with this background I can delve more deeply into the subject with other more technical texts."
2,Skip this one,"There must be at least 15-20 complete versions of the Brandenburgs currently available and many are far better than this.The sound on this 1959 recording is alternately muddy and shrill,and the playing seems half-hearted and flaccid.Even at a low price this set is no bargain.There are a slew of fine Brandenburg recordings including the Boston Baroque,Tafelmusik(period instrument),Il Giardino Armonico and Harnoncourt and Leonhardt's period performances.Two of the best bargains are I Musici on a Philips 2 for 1 set and The Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment on the excellent Virgin Veritas series."
2,IT'S A MESS,The performace seemed sloppy overall. Solos are best described as anemic and tentative. Even the low price doesn't redeem this recording.
3,High Speed But Watch Out,"I ordered this modem because of the great technical reviews and, of course, the unbeatable price. My high-speed internet access was installed by AT&T two days ago. The USB port on the modem does not work. The ethernet port works fine. Actually, it works better than fine. According to a couple of speed test sites, my connection is 33% faster then normal cable modem connections. I would call 3Com about the USB port but I don't think its worth it. They'll probably just string me along until I hang up.Also, beware of AT&T Broadband. The service tech said my modem was not compatible. He tried to get me to lease theirs. Maybe he was trying to earn a promotion to the Sales dept."
4,"OptimumOnline, Southern Connecticut","All 3Com OfficeConnect used modems bought from FinalCall come with no software CD in the package, FinalCall customer service told me. My advice is to connect the modem directly to your network card, much easier and faster then looking for USB drivers on the net and installing them. 3Com tech support told me that a lot of OfficeConnect modems have problems when connecting to USB ports. Once connected to my network card, it took less than 2 minutes to start surfing the net with a blasting speed...Overall, a nice deal"
1,Doesn't work on SE AT&T Roadrunner,"3-Com is a good name, but this cable modem just plain doesn't work on AT&T Roadrunner in my area. (Jax, FL) Had the modem tested and checked out via 3Com support. Modem passes all dianogstics. I've heard it works fine on other cable networks, and even in other parts of the country with AT&T. If you live in the SE USA, I'd buy a different brand. I've put mine up for sale."
1,Bondage breaker,"The edition which was sent to me is much earlier than the others is the study group. The chapters and pages do not match up, so it is a problem to keep pace with the group. The book itself (more so the later edition) is awesome in teaching you how to break bondages."
1,Gut Buster would be a better title for this laughable tome,"I must confess that I was only able to make it through the first two chapters of this utter piece of garbage! The author lives under the paranoid delusion that useen spirits torment us mere mortals and that modern psychology is simply man's foolish attempt to explain ""Satan's"" attacks. It's really difficult to believe that any but the most brainwashed ultra fundamentalist could take the author seriously when he describes how ""demons"" tried to keep him from a speaking engagment. Truely very funny. This book was filed in my paper recycling bin. To anyone who actually took this book seriosly, I would recomend getting a book on critical thinking because, brother, you could sure use it."
4,Works as described,"The iMage cam worked on each Mac we tried it on, (none with built in cams) with no hitches. Plugged in, worked. Quality is comparable to the iSight, size is very small and versitile. The drawback would be the magnetic base, which dosnt stick to any mac I have. Including a small versatile add-on clip would be great. It does have a tripod mounting screw, but that is of limited value when mobile. The best added feature would be a little legged laptop lid resting or clip on base."
5,Excellent for Macs,I'm using this for the Jimmy Bruno Online guitar Institute. You record yourself doing lessons and send the clip in for review by Jimmy Bruno.The camera has operated flawlessly. You will need a 2.0 usb card as 1.0 just doesn't work.
1,Disappointing,"Until now, I enjoyed John Maxwell's books, but this one is just one big yawn. Same stuff you read in his other books, which are much better."
3,Kinda Dull,I actually haven't finished this book which is rare for me. I think it got too dull for me to continue reading it. It has several worksheet type forms to fill in which may have been useful but I haven't picked it up in quite a while and actually just put it on the shelf.
4,"Fell the war, from a different perspective","Von Luck goes almost straight to the point. He takes part in the war at the invasion of Poland, France (comanding one of Rommel's famous 7th Ghost division battalions), North Africa, Russia and France again, this time defending it, at the D-Day, Ardenes among others. He is a swift writter and tries to place the reader as comfortable as possible."
2,Stay away from it,"This is a very shallow and superficial account of what was apparently a sterling wartime career. It devotes more time to his (largely uninteresting) social experiences than to any combat narrative. If you're looking, as i was, for a revealing account of a german soldiers military experiences, look elsewhere because on that level this is extremely disappointing."
4,life of a Wehrmacht officer,"The book deals suprisingly little with actual warfare. Instead, it shows the world and life of a Wehrmacht officer, from his youth to the size of power by Hitler, to the various theaters of the war and the Soviet prisoncamps. Von Luck proves to be a true professional soldier, uninterested in politics, respectful of his enemies, caring for his men and devoid of bitterness.Good read!"
5,Fantastic!,"Simply put, this is one of the best books of its type ever written. There are no flaws at all. The Oberst has written a book containing a wealth of valuable information with tremendous literary skill."
2,historical memoir at its worst,"Don't be misled by the high ranking reviews. This book is a breezy read of a man going on a long vacation, sipping wines and smoking cigarettes with an enemy who is grateful for being ""liberated"". It is tragic that a German tank leader would leave such a trite legacy. I read Rommel's ""Attacks"" at the same time -- pity that Luck didn't learn from his mentor's literary style of detail and candor. I believe that Luck mentions that his orderly, Beck, kept a journal. Now that I would love to read."
2,Who would buy this book used?????,Really - who would buy this book used??? It's not worth the $1.59 price tag. Buying rubber gloves in order to read this book would double the price!
3,Good Shipping,"The book was in good shape, and the sjipping was very fast. The book however did not come with the cover and had red highlighting. When buying the book, the description said that it had some highlighting but it should have said more detail. The previose owner was neglectful with the underlining, and the book had smudges of what seems like dirt. The book did not come with the paper cover either."
2,Very average,"Very average, obviously home-made video. My two year old daughter could only watch it a few times before getting bored."
4,worked fine,"Actually good amount of ink left. I find that buying refilled cartridges can be so variable, you either get a cartridge with a ton of ink or one that has almost done. May be a good idea to order more than one since they are so cheap. Still a better deal than buying the full price ones."
1,In a Wink No Ink,"I've bought 2 of these from different sellers. They usually send a refilled one & not a new one (even if it is listed as new) so I recommend verifing before buying. Both of them were listed as compatible but I can only print a page or 2 before my printer tells me my cartride is NOT compatible. So, I have to try and trick my printer so I can get a couple more pages printed and sometimes that doesn't work either. It's a real pain! I recommend buying a new HP brand cartride in it's original packge. These are a waste of time and money."
1,Completely useless,"If you're studying for the A+ Certification and you haven't traveled back in time to the year 2001, this is NOT the book for you. While I'm sure this was useful for whatever version of the A+ exam was being floated around in the pre-9/11 era, the information in this book is now completely obsolete. There's a reason this is (currently) available for 69 cents. When it comes to IT books, check the publishing dates.Drop some money on the newest edition of Mike Meyer's A+ Certification All-In-One Exam Guide. (You know, the ~1100 page one.) I just passed the 2006 version of the A+ yesterday using that book as almost my only study material."
3,good magazine-slow delivery,"My Husband and I love reading this magazine! Do we receive it at our home? NO! WE read it at Barnes and Noble. It's got awesome ideas and is worth the money. The funny thing is that I ordered it from Amazon for my husband in July, and it's not here at Halloween. So, magazine is cool, and makes a great gift. Just don't expect to receive it by Christmas if you are giving it as a gift, because it probably won't arrive until March!"
5,Strong recommendation to reading lovers,Stella never had so good with young Toni coming up in her neck of the woods. This novel support a tight and consitent story line. But watch out; the edges are sharp and the angles are mind-bending. Read it for yourself and see if you can keep up.
5,Phenomenal,"""A book that truly embraces readers. Hallema is a phenomenal writer and ""Mass Deception"", is definitely a book of true talent. (Thanks for representing the sistahs of Delta Sigma Theta, Inc.)"
2,It was okay.,"I give it 2 stars. The way this book was written could've been better. Much better.The feel of the story, the voice, didn't pull me in. I read 2 other really good books in between this one and those books were longer. I picked this one up every now and then to read a few pages. Very rarely do I start a book and not finish it so I felt inclined to read it through to the end.It was scattered and a little disoriented in parts. Too many first person narratives, although most of it was Toni talking. It even jumped to third person a time or two.There were typos all over the place. I'm no English teacher, but that just makes me twitch.The storyline was good, but the writing form was bad. I may or may not read the 2nd part of this story."
1,It wasn't for me,"I wasn't feeling this book at all so I put it down permanently before I was halfway through. Maybe I should have stuck with it but I just could not get into it. It got great reviews otherwise, so I guess I'll try again."
2,Not worth it,"Tyr blendy pens seemed good, but after a WEEK of using them they were all dryed out!! It's not worth it!"
5,"Professional Killers in Washington, DC","This is the most interesting and exciting of the Margaret Truman mysteries that I have read. Congressman Paul Latham has been nominated by the President to be Secretary of State. Then, he is found lying dead beneath the Statue of Freedom, a pistol clutched in his hand. Rumors swirl about suicide because of impending disclosure of illegal activity with a billionaire supporter or sexual harrasment charges by a secretary. But the medical examiner finds that it is not suicide. It is murder. As suspects are eliminated, the FBI finds that hired killers, members of the Russian mafia, are loose in Washington. But for whom do they work? When suspicion turns to the man controlling the killers, the story becomes intense, as the suspect uses his hired killers to protect himself. All in all, it is a good story, and you get the usual, wonderful insight into Washington."
4,I'm pleased with this unit,"I've had this unit for over a year, and I'm very pleased with it. My only complaint is that when I kept it on once for a few days straight, using its tuner instead of my TV tuner, it stopped working altogether. It was okay when I turned it on the next day. I've found that if I keep it on only when I'm actively watching a DVD or a VHS, then turn it off afterwards, everything's fine with it."
2,Tells only half of the story,"The detail and explanations about the banks exploitation of the mortgage markets was very well done. What was glaringly left out was how those markets were manipulated and left wide open to corruption and greed in the first place. There is little to no mention of Freddie/Fanny/Countrywide et al and the MASSIVE amount of taxpayer dollars that have gone into buying subprime mortgages in the secondary market. Government sowed the seeds of corruption by agreeing to buy overvalued mortgages, and the banks were quick to sweep in and take advantage. Without taxpayers backing the loans there would have been no subprime mortgages made in the first place."
3,It was Okay,This movie covered the same grounds as all the other films that have tried to explain what cause the Great Recession.The animated portions were entertaining.After watching so many of these I have come to the conclusion that they are all the same.Everyone or No one saw it coming and was unable to do anything about it.
2,A Somewhat one-sided view of the mortgage crisis,"The film is worth watching and covered many aspects of the mortgage crisis. It was mostly accurate in what it covered, but was not balanced in explaining the greed working on both sides of the lending process.The predominant theme was to blame the rich, blame the banks and mortgage brokers.Rarely was any blame assigned to personal greed of the borrowers, some of whom actually profited from their financial deals (by living rent free for many months after they stopped making payments).At one point it was stated that the fees and points charged by the lenders for refinancing loans in urban neighborhoods were the main cause of home equity decreasing in those neighborhoods (and not the cash being pulled out). Very misleading.The ""Flaw"" in loose mortgage policy is that home prices can fall (not the propagandist themes that this film portrays)."
3,Excerpt From Back of Book,"The cozy house in woodsy Wisconsin is just the escape Chessie Wilder craves. Here, far from the big city stress she left behind, she can transform herself into someone other than the trustworthy, dependable doormat she's always been. The first step toward becoming a brazen new woman is to evict the tenant she's inherited along with the house. But instead of the reclusive hippie-type she expected, Seth Carpenter turns out to be charismatic, sexy-and as determined to stay put as Chessie is!Seth gives his lovely new landlady a week, tops, before she concludes she isn't cut out for a rustic lifestyle. Then Chessie will beg him to take the house off her hands and hightail it back to Chicago, while he permanently settles in at last. A perfect plan-with one hitch: Chessie seems to be making herself right at home. And the longer this beautiful, desirable woman stays, the harder it is for Seth to picture the house-and his life-without her."
2,Shrinks when boiled to sterilize,Very very cute bottle but it has a huge flaw. I was instructed by my pediatrician to boil all nursing items for 20 minutes due to my daughter having recurring Thrush. I put this nurser in with other bottles my daughter had used that day because she touched the bottle repeatedly during feedings after having her hands in her Thrush infested mouth. This nurser shrunk like a shrinky-dink! It shrunk to about 1/4 of it normal size. Strangest thing I have ever seen. Do not use/purchase this nurser/bottle if you boil your bottles to sterilize them due to you or your child being sick.
1,horrible allergic reaction! I was miserable,I was absolutely miserable for over a week after using this. I couldn't be seen since I was so swollen and red. I don't break out to other products. I wish I could determine what ingredient it is that exactly affected me.
5,Excellent on on my 78 year old mom,My mom love it ans she us 78 years old. No bad reactions for her. Some people have sensitive skin I guess.
1,Pure Paul!!,Using controversy to rake in the bucks from the Mullet(Bammer) Nation. Book is a complete joke.
1,Bama sucks,"After Bear Bryant dies and enters the Pearly Gates, God takes him on a tour. He shows Bear a little two-bedroom house with a faded Alabama banner hanging from the front porch.""This is your house, coach,"" God says happily.""Most people don't get their own houses up here.""Bear looks at the house, then turns around and looks at the one sitting on top of the hill. It's a huge, beautiful two-story mansion with white marble columns and little patios under all the windows. Auburn flags line both sides of the sidewalk and a huge Auburn banner hangs between the marble columns.""Thanks for the house, God,"" Bear says. ""But let me ask you a question. I get this little two-bedroom house with a faded banner and Shug gets a mansion with Auburn banners and AU flags flying all over the place. Why is that?""God looks at him seriously for a moment, then says, ""Bear, that's not Shug's house. That's mine."""
3,Poorly toasted granola with a lack of taste.,This granola is a poor competitor to both UDI's or evn Bear Naked Fruit and NUT granola. It is insufficiently toasted and has a boring lack of flavor.
5,"""Oh my broken lamb, I worry when you cry...""",This album is pure beauty. Words cannot descibe my love for this band and this album.
5,Very good horror book,"I am posting this in response to the reviewer who had problems with the grammar in this book. The book was written in diary form, and without giving away key plot lines, the grammar was a reflection of the main character, not the author and proofreader's oversight.This is not a happy go lucky book, it is a dark look at human nature and relationships. That said, the ""errors"" are part of the tapestry.I won't say this book is for everyone, it is very graphic, and disturbing in most parts, but that's what horror is all about, right? :) It made me think about it after finishing it, and that's a good thing for me."
1,Lousy,"The black cartridge worked for like a week, and now doesn't. I have tried cleaning the print head and aligning the cartridge. Haven't tried the color cartridge yet. What a waste."
1,no ink in them,"I got the color and the black in carts, when they arrived they were both empty. I won't buy these again."
1,Don't waste your money,I thought I'd take a chance and save money on these cartridges. The color one didn't work at all from the start and the black works intermittently. Very frustrating. Back to paying a premium on HP brand...
2,worked great at first but then....,I ordered my cartridges around Christmas time. They came in a timely fashion and worked great at first. I printed off some pictures to give to some family memebers. The color was great it printed just like it was supposed to. I went to use my printer a few weeks ago and now my printer is giving me an error that says I have the wrong color cartridge. I emailed the company about the problem and am now waiting to hear back from them. I really want to come back and change my review because they did do a great job printing until this error message came up.
2,Not a good value,"While these cartridges are cheaper than genuine HP, their value is not good. The color cartridges don't have the same lifespan as the genuine inks. The black cartridge just stopped working halfway through when the printer stopped recognizing it. At first we thought this might have been an error with the printer itself, but the same issue happened with a second HP printer in the office. I'm not really ""saving"" any money if I need two of each to equal one genuine."
3,"Beautiful, but lacking content","The cards are absolutely beautiful. They're sturdy and shiny and are approximately 5x3.5 inches.The front of each card displays an act of self care (self-love, gratitude, choice, independence, etc...) and has gorgeous artwork to match. The back has one phrase to describe the specific act of self-care. This is why I gave the cards 3 stars. I wanted more description and detail on the back of the cards. Even just one more sentence or phrase might have quelled my thirst for the peaceful feeling these cards have the potential to elicit. But instead I feel a slight pang of disappointment.Still beautiful to look at...just not all I had hoped for."
5,Beautiful Cards,I think I have just about all of Cheryl Richardson's card sets. I really love these. Very beautiful artwork. Inspirational.
1,Worse zombie B movie I seen,"Okay, I thought I seen bad zombies movies like Dead Season, but this movie was even worse than that!This movie really does try to do too much story telling. It doesn't just have humans and zombies, but also have vampires and vampries/zombie hybrids. I found the vampires flash backs really dumb and wasn't needed at all. There are a lot of fights scenes, but not all the fight scenes were needed. Only some fights scenes did helped the movie farther the story while others just slowed down the movie.The ending wasn't that great and tried too hard to push for a sequel. And that would never happen because this movie was just a total bore. People should save their time and money and seriously pass on this one."
4,"Color temperature is good, instant on","I'd been through about 4 different compact fluorescents, trying to find one that reasonably resembles a tungsten color temperature. This one is the best so far! The light output seems just a bit lower than some others I've tried, and I've only had it for a little over a month now, so I can't tell whether it will last as long as they claim it will. But, so far so good."
5,Fantastic for silver!,"This worked like magic on my silver rings and necklaces. Several were extremely tarnished and this removed all traces of tarnish in a matter of seconds. Not sure how it works on gold, but on silver it's amazing."
3,Not the end of my search,Eons ago I had an LP collection of waltz music that was wonderful backgroung music for Sunday morning with the NY Times and coffee et cetera. This is not as good as that collection was but I'll listen to it now and then until I find what I'm looking for.
2,Too Slick,"With all due respect, anyone rating this album 5 stars desperately needs to head down to Baton Rouge to see the real Larry Garner (NOT the slicked-up, over-produced version you hear on this CD). Larry at his best is real, genuine, and down-to-earth. This album screwed Larry's style up and set him on the wrong track. Try Double Dues or You Need to Live A Little for a better taste."
2,OKAY BOOK,"The book is okay, but is kind of out of date. Also, it repeats the untrue rumor that their are two endings to ""KING KONG VS. GODZILLA"" (1962). Also, in ""KING KONG ESCAPES"" (1967), he said that Dr. Who built MechaKong after King Kong escaped, but actually MechaKong was built before Dr. Who even caught King Kong. And don't exepct to find anything on ""KING KONG LIVES"" (1986), the last film it talks about is ""KING KONG"" (1976)."
1,Crap!,"Crap!I guess she intends to call it quits by releasing this crappy hits collection!She is definitely one the artists who cannot keep their career going!Retiring would be better for you,Leann,and I don't like your name."
5,VERY GOOD!,"ALL OF HER BEST SONGS,EXEPT ONE.....TIC TOC!I THINK IT SOULD HAVE TIC TOC BECAUSE I THINK IT`S THE BEST OF ALL HER POP SONGS!MY FAVORETE SONG ON THIS CD IS LIFE GOES ON!I WOULD RECCOMEND THIS CD FOR LOTS OF PEOPLE!I THINK I`M LEANNS #1 FAN!"
5,MUSIC AN AWSOME THING TO STEPHEN KING!!!!,Anyone who buys this CD should really enjoy it cause it is so good and really brings out the best parts of horror movies--the music. Not to mention it is from the King of Horror Stephen King and it's made by Drew's Famous Music so you know its good man. !!
4,Good for the price,"the quality and construction appear to be very good. It does not fit the actual shape of the bed of my Titan, but appears narrower at the back than the front. Measurements of the bed show that it is consistent.Very easy installation and operation."
5,Great Product,"I purchased this after researching the different covers, I like the tri-fold design. It's easy to install and use. Works great, had to move some stuff in the pouring rain and it kept everything dry. Amazon had the best price. I like how it easy it is to open or remove."
1,falls apart,I got this toy for my son for Christmas. Santa was taking it out of the box to put under the tree and I hadn't even gotten all the ties undone and the darn wing fall off.
4,Tom Clancy Meets the Rapture/Settling In To A New Series,"I was quite pleased with the second installment of the Left Behind military series. While this volume does not cover a large amount of time, it gives us a chance to become connected with, and thereby care for, the characters introduced in volume one. You can feel the evil beginning to develop - almost like having the hairs on your neck standing up. I would suggest that readers begin with the Left Behind series before beginning the military set, because it helps to have the entire scenario in your head as you begin the Apocalypse novels - it makes everything that much more suspenseful because you already KNOW what the characters have yet to discover! I read this book in one day. I recommend it,highly!"
3,Granddaughter gift,Sorry I can't properly evaluate this book as it was a gift to my granddaughters and I didn't work any of the puzzles. I'm sure they will comment later and I then can provide their evaluation.
2,Has not held up well,"Hearing the song ""Ruby Slippers"" on Radio Paradise, and then reading the reviews here, convinced me to buy this. Ruby Slippers is good. The rest might have been considered good over 10 years ago, but not now."
5,So Far So Good,"Purchased 1 month ago as a floor model. Saved $200 over lowest price on internet. I'm a photographer and nothing that I run seems to bother it. It's very stabile, even though I don't have much expierence with XP/MCE. This is my first Sony, usually buying Dell or Compaq in the past. The minute it causes problems, you will be the first to know. Buy it. The features are incredible and it currently seems to be crash proof."
4,Favorite accessory,This laptop stand not only helps with the cooling - it also raises the computer for better viewing and is easier on your wrists. I've been asked by numerous people where I got this and have recommended it to I don't know how many people. Mine recently broke (my husband accidentally kicked the stand while it was on the floor) and I immediately ordered another one.
3,Not as pictured,"Look closely at all of the pictures available for this product. The one I was shipped is not the same as the one that shows up on the main product page. My model has many fewer vent holes and isn't substantial enough to support the weight of my 15"" Gateway (thin and light) laptop when opened flat. It will suffice, however, as a stand, and does seem to provide as much room for air movement under the laptop as if it were sitting on a flat surface. Worth $10, not $20."
3,Targus Portable Lapdesk,"It's average. It is a little too wide for use in an armchair, but not wide enough to fit over the arms. It is too wide to use on an airplane--at least not the smaller ones I fly. It folds in half, but it is too big, folded, to fit into my laptop carrier (Briggs & Riley). It might fit easily into a larger carrier--mine's compact. It seems to be made well. I just don't use it much."
1,"Flimsy, Not for anything heavier than your palm pilot","I purchased the original lapdesk that this product is based on. While this looks the same in the picture, this item is meant for a much much lighter laptop than any I have used. Might be good for the ultra-sub-notebook set, but not much good for anything modestly sized. I suggest that you look for another lapdesk."
4,Light Weight and Thin,"It is very light weight, compact, and thin laptop pad with good build quality. One can take in the backpack while travelling/ commuting."
1,Lasted about a year,"HP really put out a dud with this model. Unless you use the super expensive HP branded paper, the ink will smudge..even after a week. Also, constant jams and bent edges. Local HP Authorized repair place unable to fix it. Printer is very loud (fans and paper path mechanisms). I will give it credit for having nice print quality, but I would not purchcase this unit ever again."
5,Wow,"I actually was an extra on this movie and worked as one of the technical advisors. I had no idea anyone even knew about this production. I thought the story was strong, as was the screenplay and everyone involved really put their hearts into it."
3,Playing for Time,"The physical aspect of the vhs is wonderful. I am not sure if it is my vhs player or the tape, but the picture quality was pretty poor. Considering how old of a tape it it, though, I am happy with it. I am going to try watching it on another player later and see if there is any difference. Wonderful movie though!!!"
3,Slanted Bacon Tray,"The tray works well enough. However, it would drain better if the feet were taller on the top end so that it was higher than the end with the collection area. I do like using the tray for defrosting."
3,Poor shipping packaging by Amazon.com,"The item, when intact, is the best microwave cooker I have found. I have purchased many others and they do not hold as much bacon nor drain the fat off as effectively. It works very well in a standard size microwave with a turntable. My only GREAT disappointment was with the packaging for shipping that was done by Amazon. We ordered 2 and both were cracked or broken beyond use. After we received 2 more, only 1 was not damaged. I spoke to Amazon.com several times, they are EXTREMELY helpful, courteous and prompt. The problem lies in the packaging department for this item. We were NOT charged any extra amounts for shipping and return was not unnecessary. After two attempts to correct the shipping, Amazon reimbursed the entire amount! I would rather have had BOTH trays but was very satisfied with how Amazon handled the transactions."
1,Make of #7 plastic that leaches BPA when microwaved!,"Flip it over and you see the #7 material marking which is known to leach BPA into the food when heated. They don't even recommend using the in dishwasher heat, so i can only imagine how much is leaching with microwave and hot bacon grease heat.I have been using one of these for years and love the functional design, but will be hunting for a glass substitute now.bummer i know, but I would find a safer option and steer clear of this one."
2,Desert Rose,The material used wasn't as thick as the original plate. The colors didn't correspond to the original either-they were too bright.
4,Good ol' Robbie Benson!,Was happy to get to view this movie again! Had seen it several years ago and enjoyed it then....and am enjoying it now!
2,Calvin & Hobbes: Sunday Pages,"Not terribly impressed. Very small selection of comics, and each strip repeats twice (original & color). It's a neat idea to collect some of the strips with Bill Watterson's comments about them, but not really worth spending money on when I'm assuming you can get the same strips elsewhere with many, many more."
5,Great buy,"The book was in great price, and it arrived in great condition. The best thing was, however, the promptness of the delivery!! Thank you very much."
4,Great Reference Book,This book is a great scientific reference book while weaving in the history of how people discovered what we know about ferns. It has wonderful illustrations which are very detailed. It is also an interesting read even if you don't need it for a research paper. It is the most comprehensive book on the topic of ferns which we could find and one of the few which can be used extensively for a botany class.
2,stale and old,"I guess I was not lucky and my shipment was made of old and/or improperly stored stock. Bad taste and flavor, no more purchases from me of this one."
3,all in all a good read,"This book was mostly an okay one except that she was a bit repetitous and extremely harsh on Fawn Brodie's book Thomas Jefferson:an Intimate History. I have not read Brodie's book but from how Dabney puts it, it is rubbish, lacking in evidence, untruthful, and just plain nonsense. You almost got the sense that she didn't really like Brodie for more than just her book. Some of Dabney's sarcastic comments are quite funny, if not a bit harsh at times. But it is an intersting book if you like history and Thomas Jefferson."
3,An Interesting Rebutal to Brodie,"The Jefferson/Sally Hemmings story has recently been accepted as fact. Before you accept Fawn Brodie's account (which re-fueld this 200 year old speculation) or the TV movie which recently told a highly inaccurate version, please read Dabney's smart little book. Dabney takes on Brodie point by point. I don't claim to know the truth of what, if anything, went on between Jefferson and Sally... But frankly, nobody else knows either. All these accounts are speculative at best. I am not a fan of Thomas Jefferson. Still, it seems wrong to trash him with a scandal two hundred years old that can't be proven one way or the other, inspite of DNA testing."
4,Enjoyable,I really enjoyed reading 'Soon' on my Kindle. It was an exciting read and moved rather quickly to keep your attention. I would recommend it for entertainment. The characters are well-developed but the end was too abrupt. I have read the Left Behind series and it seemed to be consistent with their content.
1,Persecution,"Xtians have always fallen over themselves to tell you how very oppressed they are. The truth of the matter is the last truly persecuted xtian lived in early Rome and got thrown to the lions. Otherwise, you guys have pretty much been in charge of western civilization for the last 1500 years. So what are you complaining about? I think you've got some kind of pathological victim syndrome."
5,Jerry Jenkins at his best,"What a great book! It started off with action, BOOM right out the cage. I think the main character is so well described, very human, and proves that you can be both human and superhuman as he(with the grace of God) pulls off some really incredible feats. Also I like the way the United States was split, his reasoning was great!I can't wait for Silenced, already pre-ordered it!"
4,Easy read.,"I consider this to be light reading as far as Christian reading goes. It had a great plot, well developed characters, and a somewhat surprising ending. It is written in a way that all ages can enjoy it, and is not overly ""preachy"" at all. Seldom does a Christian novel meet this standard. If you like mysteries, this is the book for you. If you like intrigue, this is the book for you. It also shows the power of faith, even to those that feel they might not deserve the love of God. The only reason I gave it four stars was I thought the book could have been longer and still hold the attention of the reader."
4,Enjoyable,"This is a great, short series of three books. A few cheesy spots, but it's a good story and a fast read. I enjoyed the whole series, although I can't figure out why the 1st and 3rd books were available electronically, but the second one wasn't??"
1,I tried,"I tried to listen to ""SOON"" after having enjoyed the 'left behind' series. But I must confess that this novel failed to grab me. The narrator's narration was uninspired, the characterization (yet another womanizing chump ala ""Rayford), left me cold, and the parallels to the life of apostle Paul were tedious. I also grew bored with the 'persecution of poor widdle innocent Christians' which seems to be the single note played over and over in the 'end times fiction.' Somehow I seriously doubt you'll get Christians to give up God quite so easily, and I don't see the world capital moving to Switzerland anytime soon.1 star. Silly."
3,Decent book but Amazon description does not indicate the inclusion of ActivStats (which it does come with),"The book itself is good and relatively easy to understand. It is not a book that you can just learn statistics on your own with and it does help to have a teacher to guide you through but it is an easy read.I purchased this book for a statistics course and also needed a software package called ActivStats. other book stores couple the two in a package but no where on this description did it say it included ActivStats. As a result, I purchased the software for $30 from Amazon as well. I received both of them and had two versions of ActivStats (it does come with this book) so had to send one back for barely a 1/3 refund because its software and because technically it was my mistake (even if Amazon did not mention the cd being included with the book)."
3,"""A case of the slows""","This book is obviously tailored precisely for the AP exam, which I can appreciate. However, it could contain twice the amount of information it does in half of the amount of pages.The overly long text makes frequent and painful attempts at humor (presumably to appeal to high school students like myself). Furthermore, simple concepts are described in meticulous detail with endless examples and trite analogies/jokes. This approach may work for some, but I hated it.Taking notes in this textbook would be burdensome. However, the author (editor?) highlights any important concepts (a practice I abhor because it encourages me to skim assigned readings).Pros: Well organized, a plethora of practice problems, terms lists/what can go wrong?Cons: Overly long/drawn out, could easily be streamlined to increase efficiency, too casual/'funny', Highlighted concepts + chapter terms encourage imprecise readings"
4,Great Stuff!,"For the first month of use, I cannot say the Shed Stop was making much difference. The dogs did love the flavor of it on their food however. But after 6 weeks, I am really noting less loose hair in the house and in the vacuum.The only scary thing is if you stop or run out, I hear they shed like crazy? Guess we will need to keep ordering, and the true test will come next summer with the season change."
4,It does bring your family together.,"I wouldn't of believed it...but it's true. Putting these dishes together brought a lovely spirit into our home. I actually had all the ingredients in my pantry for most of the recipes and they were easy to prepare and my family thought I was a goddess. DREAM PUFFS are a must when you want to show your kids just how much you love them in the kitchen. When I have to work a long day and need to get back in touch with the family, GODDESS IN THE KITCHEN is the cookbook I pull out first. Let the spirits in."
2,good toy unfortunately now made in China,"I saw this toy in my Childs pediatrician's office and noticed all of the children playing with it. My son would not mind sitting in the waiting room as long as the toy was ""available"". When the toy was not being used I took down the manufacturers name and model number and ordered it online.When the toy arrived in the mail I was very disappointed to see that it was now manufactured in China. The toy at the doctor's office was still made in Canada and that a huge discriminator for me. I am not opposed to Chinese manufacturing if it wouldn't be for frequent recalls due to poisonous paints or materials. Once or twice a year there are recalls. And I am assuming for every recalled product there have to be dozens which never get tested."
4,It does the work,"We use it once in a while. I can't complain about it, because it just does the work and more importantly it doesn't give any weird feeling when applied. The seller did a great job and the packaging was good."
5,Greatest Aveda Look-A-Like Ever!,"I had been Aveda loyal for years until I found this at less than half the price. I transitioned from Aveda Clove Formula shampoo to the Aura Clove as well but they have since discontinued it...I wish they'd bring it back!! Do not bother with any other conditioner if you want a conditioner that weighs down flyaways and makes your hair look healthy with lots of shine, a little goes a very long way."
3,Where the rest???,"Looks great, sounds great, but where's the AC charger and USB cable??? SonyEricsson wants another $40 on a USB cable -- get real."
4,Healthy Cows Make Happy Cows,"Mark Lewis has done it again. This is a very interesting look into the world of show cattle and the people who are devoted to their cows. This film is only about an hour long, but we get a sense of the intense competition and excitement around a show. Owners talk about who might win and who doesn't look so good this year. There are funny moments when people get really serious about their cows. Definitely fun to watch."
2,Bleah,"If you want a GOOD vampire-PI novel, go read ""Already Dead"" by Charlie Houston.Two stars for a good plot. But that's about it. The author uses a lot of words but says little. The protagonist has to tell us everything that's happening - long paragraphs of explanation that just bog down the action. The description also tended to be along the lines of ""you don't really want to know what's behind that door; it's really, really bad and will gross you out."" Yes, and? So? My imagination isn't that good; it's the author's job to fill in those blanks.And the dialogue! Talk about stilted. The female character actually says 'forfend' at one point. Come on!I know I'm one of the dissenters of this, but the author just didn't convince me about the setting or the characters.I bought this because 'someone' had thought enough about his writing that they had published more than one novel. So much for that method of picking up new authors...."
5,Something different,"I consumed this book in 3 days. It was something different from the otherworldly books I have been reading recently, but also familiar. If you like Dresden this book will fit right in your collection."
2,"I'm bored, of the Nightside","The concept for this novel had so much potential, but was utterly wasted on two-dimensional one-note characters, a limp plot, and egregious overuse of the title. Every third sentence was ""Blah blah blah blah, in the Nightside."" By the fifth iteration it was noticeable; by the twentieth it was irritating; by the end of the book I could hardly read for rolling my eyes.Two stars because it didn't make me throw it across the room, but I certainly won't be reading the others in the series.Instead of buying this book, try the Harry Dresden series by Jim Butcher:Storm Front,Fool Moon,Grave Peril,Summer Knight,Death Masks,Blood Rites,Dead Beat,Proven Guilty,White Night, and the upcomingSmall Favor."
2,Something wrong in the Nightside,"More of a 2 1/2 star book. Once it got going, and it took most of the book to get going, it was ok. I can't decide if I liked it or not. Not sure exactly what turned me off about it but I was relieved to finally finish it. None of the characters are interesting enough that you would care anything about them and Joanna had more personality shifts than I care to discuss. I hated her, felt sorry for her, was confused by her in turns and then was relieved when she turned out not to actually exist. When you consider the book is supposed to be John Taylor's story, it's told from his point of view, and yet I felt nothing absolutely nothing for his character or the Nightside that has got to scream a warning about the quality of the plot and writing."
3,Whatever,"I was surprised after I finished reading this book. It had really good reviews and I just didn't see what others were seeing. The main character of the book did seem to possibly have a decent sense of humor, but I spent his entire time describing the Nightside and just how different it was from the real world. I mean, the entire time he was discribing over and over just how different it was. He would then explain in detail over and over each and every character in the Nightside. Augh! how boring! Give action, less talk! The only reason I gave three stars was because the main charcter did have promise. I would like to see what the next book sounds like. Hopefully Green will be finished with the describing and get to the action."
4,Super Reader,"A decent short book, done in the PI type of style you would expect, if you add in a mythological city, ghosts, timewarps, monsters, and a very bad house.The main character is a Nightside resident living in the ordinary world to be left alone.A woman comes to him with a case and pulls him back in, which, for him, is very dangerous. Lucky thing is he has more than one superpower."
4,Very good book they just get better,"I started reading the nightside novels with one of the later ones, so I went back and read this one to get on the same page. A great starter novel to the series and they just get better as they go along. The world is a very intriguing different world, not to many fantasy novels out there with this type of world concept. Fun quick read."
5,Loved this series,"Very informative set about the states. Easy to use, easy to choose a particular state within the dvd. This is a well put together compilation of history of each of the US states."
4,Great Fun,"My daughter and my one and only grandson live half way across the US from me so she came up with the idea of buying the Beamers. While the picture is small and not the quality of a video, it is fun to be able to see each other. This way, I get to watch my grandson as he grows and he can see me so we are not just strangers on the phone. Really fun and does not cost any extra to use than the phone call."
1,Bread was bad - mold - and they don't accept returns,I have bought this in the store and like it so ordered on line and received molded bread and they don't accept returns. Don't order this on-line - waste of money!!!!
1,it broke!,"A day after getting this polly it fell on the sand not far at all and her bottom broke in half,her legs went flying and we were unable to put it back to together.don't buy this toy.It's a waste of money.-amanda"
1,Not a good option,"I bought this book expecting it to be an explanation of how to build a brick oven. Far from it. If you want history and sixty pages of ""facts"" this is your book, if you actually are researching to build an oven it won't do."
3,Decent bra but not for maximum support,"I've worn Champion bras over several years now. For weight lifting and the elliptical, they have always provided decent support. Recently I started running; I bought this bra looking to supplement my sports bra stash, as well as get excellent support. I'm a D cup and I bounce too much in most bras. Unfortunately this bra runs a little big on me so it's not providing me with what I need. I'm a 32 in most bras but occassionally need a 30, which Champion doesn't make. If I was still doing just the gym, it probably would be fine. I was also looking to spend less than I usually do (the last couple of years I've been wearing Natori which I love). Natori's underwires are twice the price of Champion's but they seem to be the better bet."
4,"Toy Vault 12 "" Cthulhu Plush Toy","It's a plush Cthulhu, my niece loves it. Only caveat I noticed was that there is a piece of wire in the middle of the wings to keep them rigid, I would imagine this could be a hazard to some people, but it seems to be fairly well made, not really a complaint from me."
5,"Eldritch, cyclopean, and cuddly","This little plush Cthulhu is well-made and adorable. If you can ignore the fact that he is probably secretly dreaming of your madness and destruction, he'd make a fine addition to your cubicle or collection."
4,Good for throwing against walls,"Under normal conditions, this is ironically cute. Under conditions of extraordinary frustration, it can relieve some tension to hurl an Elder God against a wall."
1,Waste of time,"Not detected in Bios after only one year.Lost alot of data, good thing i back up the important stuff.I no longer know which manufacturer to trust."
1,Huge Disappointment,"I bought this drive for a new build becasue, for the price, it's hard to turn down. However, when i tried to install windows on it, it wouldn't install, and the instillation would either freeze or give and error and stop. It didn't help that the error messages led me to believe that the problem was with the install disk, not the hard drive. This gave me a ton of stress, and after about 2 days of trying to install windows i tried linux, which also gave me errors, that proved my windows disk was fine, and led me to figure out that the hard drive was the problem. I went and bough a retail 320GB hard drive of the same brand, and sure enough, windows installed fine. Thankfully, amazon accepted the return without any hassle. It'll be a while before i buy another OEM hard drive."
3,"Good drive for a single volume, but RAID users beware","These are decent drives, but google 'TLER and RAID' to see that WD has disabled a function required for dependable RAID on all of its Black, Blue and Green drives. This means you can setup a RAID array using these drives, but they will fail under heavy use and cause the RAID array to break.WD would like you to pay 60% more for the RE3 version drive for RAID arrays. In my view, this is a blatant cash grab. After 10 years of buying only WD drives, I will not buy another as long as they do this. Seagate has done the same, so it's only Hitachi and Samsungs for cheap RAID arrays these days."
3,Failed after 4 years in 24/7 service,"This is for the WD5000AAKS WD Caviar SE16 5000gbMDL: WD5000AAKS - 00TMA0DATE: 28 DEC 2006DCM: HBNCNV2ABI ran these drives as a pair in a RAID 1 setup on a D-Link DNS-323 NAS enclosure. Worked great until failing recently with no warning (although the NAS was configured to run a daily S.M.A.R.T. test and email me if there was a problem). This afternoon the NAS box sent me a simple message ""The Left Hard Drive has Failed"".Again, being in RAID 1 mode I did not lose my data (but am doing another backup in case the remaining drive fails). The drives worked well up until the sudden failure. They were configured to spin down after 30 minutes of no activity so I guess 4 years is a good run. These drives do tend to run hot during use though.Newer-model, single-platter drives run cooler and should be more reliable than this old 2006 beastie so I ordered a Samsung Spinpoint drive to replace it. Hope I get a longer life from it."
2,Love them naked disks,we were looking for a solution to video storage/backup that would be less expensive and allow us to make 2 backups for the price of one. this solution works - so far so good.
2,Not the best drive,"I thought that all hard drives would be created equal but I was wrong. This drive comes with a cord with a single USB plug but this did not work in my laptop since laptop USB drives block hard drives such as this since they take in too much energy from a single port. The only solution is a cord with two USB plugs that split the energy going from the laptop to the drive. I called Western Digital and they suggested that they could send such a double-USB cord free-of-charge in several business days.Instead of saying yes, I returned this drive and bought a similar one made by Seagate. The Seagate drive already came packaged with a double-USB cord."
2,problems and more problems,"when i get the hdd i installed in to a brand new mobo, install windows 7 ultimate 32 bits version.with the os installed, i turn on the system and get a blue screen of dead, the error code for the bsod was related to the hdd.once i was able to have the system up and running, i try to install office proffessional edition, but durind the installation process the system crash again.i'm very dissapointed for this product, i have a seagate hdd i test that one on the same system and that one works just fine."
1,Extremely poor packaging by Amazon,"I stopped buying bare drives from Newegg because they had poor packaging. Now it is time to do the same from Amazon.The drive was put in a box with two sheets of bubble wrap. The drive was not wrapped in the bubble wrap. The drive was not suspended in inserts to keep it from being banged around.Worse, the two short sheets of bubble wrap put into the box were completely deflated. Not one bubble had any air left in it.So, essentially, this drive was unprotected, just banging around in the box while it was being shipped."
3,Too soon to know about the drive,"Drive is working so far, but too soon to comment on it's quality.BUT the packaging was miserable! Appalling! A little piece of plastic with an inflated bubble that was sitting beside, not surrounding, the drive. Not even peanuts! The drive was sloshing around in the box as if it were an unbreakable chunk of solid steel. Could shock have caused a minute crack in a lead or a solder that will shorten its life? I'll never know - and the fact that I can speculate about that is a black mark on Amazon. New Egg has become noted for bad packaging of OEM drives and I guess Amazon wants to keep pace."
1,died after 2 years,drive failure after about 2 years. what more can i say ? Not sure if the problem is with Western Digital or with the seller...
4,Good quality,Western digitial never seems to disappoint in their quality of hard drives. Reliable and well built for the money. I recommend.
1,Maybe mine was defective...,"I bought this one in 2008. In less of two years it stopped! At first everything was OK, but before a year of use, my computer said ""the disk is very damaged and recommended change it"", in that times, bug reports indicated that in Palimpset (disk tool of Ubuntu 9.10) had a bug reading S.M.A.R.T. showing warning messages by mistake and Windows disk tool didn't detect anything wrong, then ignoring the Ubuntu warnings, I kept using it. Last year I had to buy a new hard drive because my Western Digital was damaged and took half of my data without backup. I have a couple of excellent WD disks in the same computer, one of 80 GB (2004) and another of 160 GB (2008), I don't know what happend with this model..."
2,didn't last long,"bought it on March 2011reach 200/500GB now (February 2012)problems:-read/write speed drops pretty badly-have hard time installing or downloading anything large-computer crash several times with blue screen saying hard disk problemfor the price I paid, half dead is acceptable since it haven't lose any data yethowever, it will be nice if it last at least 3 years..."
5,Nice Product !,"This Beanie is awesome! The quality of the material is fantastic, especially given the price. I would recommend this to any fellow Bronco fan!"
5,Music To My Ears,"My Dad heard track # 12, ""Valse Fontenac"" on the radio and thought it was the most beautiful piece of music he had ever heard. As a result, he puchased ""Beauty of the North"" for me to enjoy. There only are five instrumentalists playing and there music results in beautiful, melodic and sometimes even haunting music. It is mostly traditional music collected from different parts of the world. The Chicoutimi Set is one of the best sets off The Beauty of the North as it is both cheerful and bouncey, and also great to listen to. Altogether Beauty of the North is a brilliant collection of traditional favourites and is a must buy CD."
2,Don't rely solely on this book,"Easy to read, author breaks down some of the more difficult concepts presented. The text is broken up with lots of photos, charts, and figures. This is a great familiarization for people that can't get their hands-on networking hardware. However, as others have noted, this book is full of typos and information that is just downright wrong! For instance, the author sites InterNIC as the agency responsible for assigning IP addresses (should be IANA). The test engine on the enclosed CD only works if you have MS Access. I have Access, but I still have to play around with the test engine to get it to work. As is the case with most of these certification series books, they give you two free tests, but you have to purchase a code to unlock the other tests. The questions on the free tests were too easy. I would recommend Microsoft Press's book and the Exam Cram Networks+ as your primary study materials."
2,All in One Cert,I found the book overall clear in the detail that was writtenbut poorly presented graphically. You need to have a knowledgeof networking before tackling this book. There are a lot of errors and some information that should be there is not ie; Whatdoes a Fibre port look like. The CD is of no use if you are running Win2k or XP. To sum up the book looks old and is old by technology standards. By the way I passed at 928.
3,Disappointing,"The range of the performances on this CD is fairly large. The Mussorgsky is poorly done. The Pittsburgh Orchestra hardly gives credit to the grandiose and gothic portrait of Bald Mountain. On the other hand, Borodin's Polovtsian Dances and Steppes of Central Asia are good, but not stellar. The Symphony No. 2 is well done as well by Vienna, but again not exciting. These are some really fun pieces by a composer/chemist. An OK CD. Fine for the Borodin pieces, but find another recording for the Mussorgsky..."
3,"Biased, but a good primer on business ethics","This book is a good primer on business ethics, and it would be even better if the writer / editors hadn't shown their bias with their selections of included material.Business ethics theories evolve, just like any other social phenomenon; however, just because a theory is new doesn't make it right. Especially in an ethics book! The authors are clearly biased against big business, against small government, and against ""shareholder management"" theory.Does this make them right or wrong? No. The only ""wrong"" committed is the bias itself.As you read this book, just keep your critical thinking skills sharp and your eyes open."
4,Excellent Social History,"This book is well-written and difficult to put down. The author did his research well. It is a good explanation of the Margaret Eaton Affair and of the social mores that women were expected to live by in the 1820s and 1830s. It is also a classic example of the theory that ""men get their identity by what they do; women, by their family."" Margaret Eaton could not escape that she was the daughter of a ""tavern-keeper"" and many of the slanders against her were merely based on the prejudices of the time concerning the stereotypical behavior of the daughters of tavern-keepers."
2,Not for the beginners,"When I bought this book two years ago, I had no knowledge of TCP/IP networking. Some of the topics particularly subnetting, were not well explained and confusing. Now that I know subnetting quite well, I think the author made it too complex for such an easy subject. This book is more for engineers who deals with product development such as routers, switches, etc. Think again in buying this book if you're a beginner."
5,Great Edition,"This special edition has a lot of advantages: the main film itself on disc 1 is OK; good picture quality and subtitles not hardcoded. The extras on disc 2 are worth viewing, both the interviews with Villaronga and the 3 short movies. Moreover, the discs are region-free, so there's no problem to view this ""American"" edition in your European DVD-player and/or PC. For sure, it's great value for money."
5,En Evocative Musical Escape to England,"I bought this CD on a whim, and it far exceeded my expectations. Edward Flower's arrangements of these folk songs (most for two guitars) are truly exquisite; each piece is a miniature artistic gem, capturing the soulful, plaintive, and often melancholy mood of these timeless tunes. This is a great CD to put on when you want to relax. Just sit back with a cup of tea, close your eyes, and let your mind drift off to the quiet meadows, shady woods, and green rolling hills of England!"
1,A complete waste of money.,We have purchased two of these pumps and we lucky if they worked for a month or two being used at the most 2 to 3 hours a day. Last summer we stored our brand new pump carefully knowing how sensitive these pumps are. We set up our pool this spring and plugged in our carefully-stored pump- nothing. There is no reason why this should not work other than shoddy workmanship. Don't waste your money.
1,Did not last long.,I bought the pump on june 20 and it lasted to aug. 18. I only ran the pump 3hrs. in the morning and 3hrs. at night. I thought I would at least get the summer out of it.
1,Pump broke,We received the pump around June 23. It broke on July 21. How can I get it replaced. We feel pump should last longer then one month.
5,Great Price. Works like a charm.,"I use it for a DIY solar heater I made. It pumps water through just fine, and it's airtight, so it keeps the siphon effect intact."
4,Price and pump,My pump went out found this one great pump for the price placed the order came in before the time I would do it again small pump sall price
1,Might as well not include a pump...this one is a joke,"I wish Intex would just not include a pump if it's going to have one as weak as this one. I can leave this pump running 24/7 and it will not even begin to keep my 12' x 30"" pool clean. Just sell your pool and let buyers buy a good pump separately. Now I have to buy a larger pump to replace this joke."
5,PC Video Cable,The cable I ordered was modestly priced and the exact length that I needed for the project I was on. It worked as advertised and I was very satisfied with the quality of the cable.
1,Very Poor Quality,"We purchased this product and were very happy with the shipping time. While trying to put the cover on the trailer one of the tie down loops fell off. Once the cover was positioned on the trailer we tried to pull some slack out as instructed, with the back cross tie and it also came off. Upon inspection this cover is very poorly constructed. The spots where the straps are sewn include a very soft material connecting the strap to the cover. The material will not support the strap connected to it. The material the cover is made of seems overly light for the intended purpose of protecting a travel trailer from the winter weather. Another odd thing was the size of the cover. I have a 23 foot travel trailer so I ordered one to fit a 22 to 24 foot trailer. There was about 5 feet of extra length in the cover and with all the straps falling off no way to tie the cover down.I returned the product to Amazon as unusable/defective."
5,Wasn't Armstrong one of the first on the moon?,"It's hard to believe, but I met Peter for the last time over 2 years ago. I bought (no, it was no gift) his book and it is still between Dan Brown and Tom Clancy on my bookshelf (yes, I read it - many times and it still makes me laugh). I can recomment this book for all that are in IT and for those that don't have a clue what IT is (sometimes those are the same people). You will get a perfect understanding about who and what sad bastards are. Keep on writing Peter!"
3,Great book,If you want to learn more about Emperor Francis Joseph I would recommend this book. It has a little bit about his wife Sissi (Elizabeth). That is one of the main reasons I got this book. It also tells about the world before he was born. It was a great book.
2,Twilight Of The Habsburgs,"As a regular reader of biographies (just finished a wonderful book on Talleyrand), was really disappointed. Found it to be tedious and disjointed - written like a college thesis, trying to impress the reader with as many facts thrown into a sentence as possible. Even though I plan a trip to Central Europe in the Fall, and am really interested in its history, I could not finish this book. Have currently ordered the John Van Der Kiste book on Franz Joseph and dearly hope it's better than this one."
3,Too much information,"The late Paul Johnson liked to write thick books that are difficult to read, but quite complete on each subject. If you need one reference on the history of Christianity, this is the one."
5,Wonderful,This album is excellent! Beautiful songs and very well recorded. It's a pity the other ones to be so expensive! Otherwise would buy them all!
2,Not for me,"My wife and I gave this video a try. I had not done any type of yoga before, but I'm really into fitness in general and I thought this was something we could enjoy doing together. It was good for some laughs, but not much else."
1,Cheap but not worth the trouble.,If you have more time than money this scanner might be for you. I just don't have the time to waste several days to make the driver work.
1,Not the right product,I asked for a 2005 Tahoe mirror but I got a mirror that has the wrong wire harness on it
3,Trying to get my money,"They sent no invoice. It makes it much harder for me to get reimbursed. Maybe that is how they sell them so cheap, no overhead on paper."
5,Not a self study book,"This book is not meant for self study, it is intended for college level instruction. This is the book I used when I took Russian in college. The publisher has a website with downloadable videos to aid the text. The lessons inside the book are great, but not intended for self study."
3,SUGAR!,"If you are looking for a 30-second sugar rush, this is the gum for you. The flavor lasts about that long, too. Sometimes after lunch I get an intense sugar craving. I whip these out and commence to chewing, and it works best if you chew a whole pack at one time. Within minutes I am running around my office like a gerbil on an exercise wheel, after which I feel like total crap for an hour and a half. Because (makes sideways peace sign) that's how I roll."
1,lame!!!,this game sucks with everything!! just read the first review and you'll know why.don't waste your money on a lame game like this one
2,Good for beginners not enough content though for $75 not for advanced,Noah is the best at what he does but this video is lacking in the content area. If you have spent $2000 -$3000on a dvx100 you probably already have done the research as to what this camera can do (if you have not there is no excuse) 2nd If you have Final cut pro 5 you spent any where from $600 on ebay to $1200 at the apple site. Which means you already know what FCP does and are probably really well versed in the software.If thats the case dont spend $75 on this dvd. you already know every thing that Noah says here. If you are an absolute fresh out of the box beginner that just spent $5000 on a bunch of camera and edit hardware (what are the chances of that) then the dvd is for you.
1,Uh......what the,"uhm...some kid asked his friends what they thought of tool and taped it and that's about all this dvd has to offer. it really has nothing to do with tool. no music, concert footage, maybe a five minute interview with the guitarist. i think they taped guitars in sam ash and a billboard that said a perfect circle. i wish they were able to get in the concert. anyone with a camcorder could have done this, the author should have interviewed his mom. whoever is making money off of this is a genius, i can't believe people are allowed to make money this way. save your money, buy anything else. buy the olson twins, there is a better chance of tool being in that dvd."
1,NO VIDEOS ON THIS DVD!,"I thought there were Tool vids on this. I was VERY mistaken. This is the most boring thing I have ever seen, save your money!!!!!!!!!"
1,The picture and description of this product are deceptive.,"The photo of this product on-line depicts a white, cushiony rug pad made of a solid material. The product however, is an open weave ""fish net"" like product made of a thin rubbery material. It is described online as a rug pad, but the package it arrived in describes it as an ""underlay"" and includes a picture of the product that accurately depicts its ""fishnet"" construction. My local carpet store sells real rug pads for the same price i paid for this far inferior product. I don't recommend doing business with this company."
1,Still waiting,I have never received this item. Every time I try to track the package it still shows in transit. I'm thinking that I will never receive this item.
5,"Review of Greg Maroney, Sentinel CD","Sentinel has a wide variety of classical piano pieces, from mellow and relaxing to very exciting and dynamic. Greg plays with such passion!!!!It is wonderful. Even my children love to listen to his music. Since being introduced to Greg's music, we have purchased many of his CD's to give to friends and as teacher appreciation gifts. Everyone always has had a very positive review and truly believes Greg's music is awesome and magical!!!!"
4,Interesting read,This book discusses a topic I knew very little about. I learned a lot about the Japanese take-over of Korea and how that affected the Korean people. Very interesting read.
4,Storage Container,"I'm using this for reloading and it works just fine for holding shot shell material. The picture is deceiving, as this is sold as a single unit. The product specification clearly states this. Read the fine print. I can't comment on stacking since I only purchased one!"
5,Play Ball!!!,"I am a big Phillies' fan, and watching this game for the first time was fun. I played the radio broadcast, because it was the Phillies' broadcast, and even though it was maybe 2 seconds out of sync, it was worth it. I even listened to the Cubs' TV broadcast afterwards, and it was still fun."
4,"Great documentary, not really modern marvels","I ordered this because I had always wanted to see this episode, but it never was on TV. It arrived quickly and came boxed in the same way you would find it at a store, which I liked. The documentary was very well thought out and interesting, however, because it was from VERY eary in the series(2nd or 3rd episode) it is almost nothing like the modern marvels shown today, which probably explains its abscence from live TV. So, don't buy it beause you are a Modern Marvels fan, buy it because you are interested in NYC's second tallest building. It also is a great quality tape- first one I've bought in years!"
5,A very useful product,". I purchased a new Windows Vista PC, and have 2 older PCs, an old Win98 and a 3year old Windows XP. The Vista is my main unit, but the others work fine with programs and games that work best on the computers they are on. I purchased a computer cart that let me mount both older towers and the monitor and peripherals off my XP. This switch comes with the cables you need along with the cables of your monitor, keyboard and mouse. Everything works and I am able to switch back and forth with only a seconds wait in between, You need two sets of speakers but thats minor. With a wireless network I have the newer PCs online and a dedicated old game box with very little extra hardware."
3,Good quality,"The construction of the bear is quite good and I have not seen any signs of wear and tear.The fur material is extremely soft and enjoyable, and the overall design is one you would expect from a more expensive plush.I only have 2 complaints:The first is that it seems like it should have more stuffing in the mid section, almost a bit flat. Despite this however, it still makes an excellent pillow or cuddle toy.The second complaint is the claws, they are a hard fabric, I would compare them to cardboard. This can be somewhat annoying while snuggling with the bear, because they can be a little irritating.However, I have never been scratched by them, and they do not typically annoy me.This is a good purchase."
4,Savannah Heat,Very entertaining. Enjoyed reading. Get caught up with the story line and don't want it to end.. Read all her books. Just ordered 3 more.Love Kat's books
1,"NOT ORGANIC!!!!! In fact, quite the opposite...","IF you read the ingredients you'll notice there are pthalates, paraben and sulfates and dangerous artificial colors!!! HOW DO THEY GET AWAY WITH CALLING THEMSELVES ORGANIC?! Amazon should be ashamed of themselves, supporting such a falsely advertised product! I would NOT use this on myself, but especially on my kids. TERRIBLE."
5,"Love, Love, LOVE this product","This is hands down one of the best products I've tried for coarse African American hair. Over the years, I've tried MANY products, from Pantene to Garnier, to Suave, everything! This deep conditioning treatment makes my hair silky smooth without the harsh, often overpriced, salon treatment. I can't say enough about this product, but what I will say is that it's about $4.00 at your local Walmart. Not sure what Amazon is trying to do here, but when I saw the sticker price, I was a little shocked. Definitely cheaper elsewhere so try that place first...whatever you do, make sure you pick this product up!!!"
5,Best thing I've Found Yet,"I'm a 38 year old mother of two, and have been a shutterbug and had a love affair with cameras since I could point and shoot,I've had all styles of cameras over the years but this one,my third digital camera is the best yet. I take pictures just about daily, I carry it everywhere with me, to work,in the car,I'm always getting compliments on it and it's professional design, and then...they see the finished product and they can't believe the fantastic results! I am now doing graduation photos and will be photographing two weddings this Fall! I have nothing bad to say about this camera except the pictures blur in lower light, but using a tripod helped with that. There are still features I haven't tried on it, and I've owned it six months.You won't be disappointed."
5,just as good as Photo Pro,"I got some free Photo Pro paper with my printer. I printed the same pic on Pro and Paper Plus, and the pictures looked exactly the same to me. The Pro paper may be slightly heavier. Anyway, I'll be buying this paper b/c it's great quality and a good price."
5,Awesome!!!,This is the best paper out there ... I have a Canon i550 and it just works great with this paper. I've tried Kodak paper and the quality is terrible because you can see the grain and it's not 4x6 which really is false advertising. I love being able to come home from a vacation and print my pictures with my home printer with the same results as the lab. This is a great price and have not found it cheaper anywhere else. Buy a few packs and get free shipping!
5,Great deal,"I use this paper on my Canon i860 and it prints just like, if not better then the photo's you get from the one hour photo lab. This stock is actually thicker and better quality.Super colors. The price is the best part. You get a high quality photo paper at more then 50% savings. Stock up. This is a great deal!!"
5,Excellent Product,"I absolutely love the Canon Photo Paper Plus, and I won't use any other type of photo paper. I use it with my Canon i850 printer. All of the photos are clear, sharp and beautiful. A lot of people don't believe that the photographs in my albums and frames were printed from home. The stock of paper is also excellent. Some photo papers are very thin, but this one is perfect and holds up very well. I strongly recommend this product to anyone looking for high quality paper."
2,Very short life,"I agree with everyone that this paper produces terrific results initially. If the prints are exposed to direct light for any period of time, serious fading becomes evident (using canon inks in a s750 canon printer). The pictures on my pegboard at work have faded to almost nothing within 3 months. Although I have not tried the photopaper pro, I would not trust this paper for archival photos. For about the same price (and less hassle), I am using online printing from now on."
3,Meh,"I agree with some of the other reviews. The setting,concept and characters of scar night are all very intriguing and original, but the delivery was just off.1)Uneven plot line. About 75% of the story happens in the last 5 chapters. I feel like everything before that was mostly filler.2)Despite all the horrific themes this book was not scary AT ALL. Again it comes down to the writing. I've read dark fantasies (Kings DarkTower series)that left me a little chilled afterwards...nightmares, etc. Scar Night just...fell flat.3) Speaking of flat...the characters, especially the three main characters, where dull dull dull. Devon is the only character that is well developed.I'd read the second book just to see what happens, but hopefully there'll be some improvements. I do regret actually BUYING this book. It has no re-readability what so ever."
2,Where's the story?,"The premise of this story and promise of a rich, dark fantasy made me want to read this book. Unfortunately, after reading half the book, and seemingly endless descriptions of the environment, numerous new character introductions, thin characters, and a confusing storyline, I put this down.At times the book reminded me of a game rulebook... he'll show a character doing something and then explain he had to do that to feed. With the pace of this story as slow as it was to begin with, this activity just made it worse.Also, the author likes to jump around from character to character a lot. In the hands of a more experienced/skilled writer, this is usually no problem. However, Campbell just isn't able to pull this off, and an otherwise interesting premise becomes a muddled mess.I should have taken the other poor reviews of this book to heart before reading. You should, too."
1,"Badda bing, badda boom, badda bad","Bad bad bad are the only three things wrong with this book. The author can't even get straight that Neil Dellacroce was the underboss under Castellano and that Gotti was never more than capo. Castellano hated Gotti and wanted him dead, not underboss.That's how full of it this book is. He or his ghostwriter couldn't get basic facts straight and obviously the rest is just made-up.Just one big snow job, full of obvious lies and boring."
3,Gotti WAS once an underboss to Paul Castellano...,"I see these reviews posted here about various readers claiming that this book is CRAPOLA because the author refers to John Gotti once being an underboss to Paul Castellano...However, John Gotti WAS once an underboss to Castellano, and did not like that position, nor did he like having Castellano tell him what he could and could not do, etc.Hence the reason Gotti had Castellano 'taken out'. Gotti moved up on the totem pole after Big Paul was murdered, but he started out as a basic street thug like many others did in the mob.Before passing judgment on any author's knowledge, possibly some of Amazon's readers should study more of the mafia's history in America... as there are many excellent and factual books available here (or in public libraries should they not want or be able to make an investment in a 'mafia library')."
1,Phony baloney,"This book is so bad it is funny. It's all made up! The ""tell"" is the stuff about Gotti being underboss under Castellano.The real underboss was Aniello Dellacroce, and after him it was Tommy Billotti, who was killed with Castellano.Real ""inside story."" Real ca-ca."
5,great for camping,"I bought this to use in our camper as it is small and doesn't take up much space. It is great for cutting up limes, strawberries, etc."
2,Disappointed,My son is 2 1/2 and someone gave us the cartride to Leap about having a baby so I bought leap. The reviews looked great. He is so not interested in it. I've only got him to look at it 3 times and it repeats the same things over and over. Unfortunately it wasn't worth the shipping to send it back.
5,Absolutely enjoyaable,Both my husband and I enjoy this CD. We love the music of this time period. Have given it as a gift and all the recipients have felt the same.
3,American Cellist Reviews,"This book is geared toward a British/ European audience. It does not flow logically from topic to topic or even chapter to chapter. And much of the insider information is banal or overused. Do not buy this book if you are a serious, frugal musician who wants to use money effectively."
3,"A little disappointing, but it's still pretty fun","When I purchased this, I thought it would feature some of Tiny Tim's poetry. On several records he recites some of his own works and I find them rather wonderful, but this has almost no original pieces at all. It reads somewhat like a children's book, not that that's a bad thing."
5,best self-tanner I've found.,Thanks for offering this great product.I can't find it in the winter and it's good to know I can purchase anytime on Amazon.
5,Ahmad Earl Grey Tea,"Excellent product, arrived earlier than expected. I would definately order this again. Ahmad Tea has a great flavor. I drink it all the time."
5,one of my favorites 8 years later,I accidently stumbled on this book when i was in the 6th grade and absolutley fell in love with it. I am 20 years old and i would still read it over and over. It is an amazing book with fun characters and a great plot. I definately recommend this book for any teenage girl who feels like their life is crazy and unpredictable. It is something any young girl can relate to. It makes being a girl that much more bearable.
3,"Alice in Rapture,sort of,not a good boook","I sort of liked this book, but it talked a lot about kissing and Patrick. It didn't have a good plot for a story. The only part it talked about anything else was when Pamela, Elizabeth, and her dad went to the beach. I do not recomend this book unless you like kissing and Patrick."
2,disappointing,"My sonic screwdriver looks good, but it's a dud -- no sound or light. (Yes, I'm sure the batteries are in the right way.) Kind of spoils the fun."
5,Awesome!!,alot of toys out there are never true to there tv prop counterparts but i must say that i was not only impressed but play along side the doctor on my tvwith my sonic screwdriversfx are excellent!(im 25 but i dont care big kid at heart)
5,Still Enchanting after all these years,"I loved this book as a child, and was thrilled to seeit reissued. Little Bear is the perfectly annoying littlebrother nagging Edith about the gift that Mr Bear lovedeven before it was ""fixed""."
4,fun & informative,"This is the 2nd of Kemelman's day of the week series. It's fun, clever, relatively non-violent, and informative. He gently provides insights into Judaism (p. 64: ""Our synagogues & temples--the pile of masonry, I mean--are not in themselves holy, only the words that are said there"") as well as ecumenical wisdom (p.69: ""In this life you sometimes have to choose between pleasing God & pleasing man. And In the long run, it's better to please God--He's more apt to remember"") embedded into a good mystery. I must admit I didn't figure out some of it--though I could have. Nevertheless, the author does hold out on some clues till the end of the book. It's a fun read. Enjoy!"
4,It has games and a calculator,"The previous reviewer said i90c doesn't have a calculator or games, that's incorrect. Under ""Java Apps"", you can find a calculator, a small utility to help calc the tips, and a few games. I've owned this phone for over a year, the quality has been great, but it looks kinda too bulky now so I replaced it with A630."
2,the phone is good but service is ...,"The phone is o.k. It is really large compared to the newer Sprint PCS phones for example. Plus, nextel is horrible."
3,the downfalls of the i90,"I personally have experience with the i85's and the i90's. i regretfully have to say that the i90 is known not to have good reception and the menu is really confusing. i work direct for nextel and even in our training they stated that the i90's (being the smallest nextel phone) has the worst reception. overall, its really flashy and pretty nice. i personally use it right now but dont recomend it. Definitly not a good phone for the price it costs"
5,good coffee,"ordered this last month, makes amazing coffee! it makes enough for about 8 cups. I think I will never use an electric coffee pot again!"
3,Serves its purpose,It works well and looks nice. The biggest problem was that the base weld broke only a few days after first use. We do not beat on things we own so it was disappointing
4,I have never had any problems with this paper,This paper is the mainstay for smaller project with the Hp 500 wide-body printer. I have never had any problems and the paper's weight is just right.
1,This book does NOT provide 100% coverage,"Yes, this book has a ton of typos. Yes, this book contains a lot of repetitions. Yes, many of the practice questions are horribly and obviously wrong. I'm willing to accept all of that if the chapters cover the material I need to know for the exam. Unfortunately, in this case they do not.The exam covers topics such as SQL server database partitioning and Application Center 2000 (detailed configuration). There were even cases where knowledge of BizTalk server would have helped. The chapters and the practice questions provided no help in preparation for 30% of the exam questions.My overall impression is that the author has only a mediocre knowledge of some of the material in the book. Some of the material is covered quite well, but the rest is incomplete or completely absent.Syngress normally provides quality review materials, but I'd advise choosing an alternate for this exam."
5,Fabulous,This book is the best I have seen.It is so good that I have bought extra copies to send to family.
4,Insightful and well researched,"Using information from the human genome project, Mr. Wade consolidates a wealth of useful information into a flowing narrative giving insight into the history of mankind from its origin in northeast Africa. He intertwines anthropology, linguistics, and genomic information to help explain the conclusions of researchers regarding the routes by which human society spread across the globe, and how societies evolved as people traveled. This is a nice piece of non-fiction, ""translated"" to those of us not directly in these fields of science."
5,"A facinating read, Science, Humans, Early man & Society","This is one of the best books I have read on a scientific level. The author does not attempt to impress you with his knowledge of Latin names of animals and plants, but writes in an entertainng, enlightening way...easily understood by the layman. I was astonded by the insights this author has into the origins of man, the importance of genetics, and the way our ancestors sought to be the ones whose genes were passed down through the generations (Darwinism). This is a very pleasing read, and can barely be put down once started...you WILL enjoy this book a lot, if you desire to know more about how we got to this place in time as we are."
3,Good Stuff!,A well written survey of the impact of genetic research on the study of human evolution and the understanding of pre-history. Very readable coverage of some complicated material. Thought provoking.
4,"Let's set the record straight (or flat, perhaps)","Not necessarily the holy grail of hard rock, but damn fine and solid throughout. Very good songwriting, sense of dynamics and sense of overall heaviness. Not like the over the top metal stuff of recent years. Recommended for fans of midwest heavy rock with a somewhat prog twist ca. 60s-70s ala SRC, Third Power, etc. I prefer the MC5, Stooges, etc., but this is a cool listen nonetheless."
5,This is not the 'light' version and it is awesome.,"Thank you to the person that recommend the regular/heavy version of this capo. I paid more, but I am so happy with this product. It's small, light, pretty, and well constructed. I would say it is Very easy to get on and off the guitar. Biggest strengths are 1. how small and not in the way it is. 2. being able to tighten it down just as much as needed to get the best sound. I'm using it on a standard acoustic/steel string guitar, and it fits perfect. If I run into a problem with it, I will update."
2,too bad,"ok I am a huge x-files fan i love the show, but season nine was by far the worst. This season lost a lot of what had made the show great in the past, and i think that it was because of the writing and because Duchovny was gone(ok so am a girl and i think he's hot but that has very little to do with this). With Duchovny gone for the second season in a row you lost a lot of the emontion that he(Molder) brought to the show we lost his passion to find the truth. so yes i did buy this but only because i love this show to much not to own every season but if you are not like me ( and lets hope you aren't) do not buy this season if you are a fan of the early ones."
1,Don't let FOX profit from this garbage they call Season 9!,"The X-Files used to be the greatest show on TV. Note the word USED. It should have ended after season 7, but Fox wouldnt let it go out on top. If you have seen the show, then the only reason you should purchase this is if youre crazy and enjoy watching awful shows. If you haven't seen it, get the other seasons instead. Regardless of all this, I am still half tempted to buy it, becuase I have compulsion that requires me to collect all things from the show, like the action figures, the lunchbox, t-shirts.... But if you are planning on getting this expecting outstanding storywriting and acting like the seasons that preceded this one, you will be extremely dissapointed."
3,BIG MISTAKE,"Being a huge fan of the series, I admittedly left the show for dead after the 8th season. However, after getting the opportunity to go back and watch the 9th season in syndication, I realize I made a huge mistake by turning my back on the greatest television series ever. The 9th season proved, if nothing else, that there were more stories to tell, and with Doggett and Reyes a very fresh way of telling them. Certainly, the 9th season was not the best X-files season (it was honestly,probably the worst) but when compared to what the other networks were offering (and are offering now) The X-Files still laid claim to being one of the best, most original shows out there. It's great watching shows like CSI and Alias and really seeing the influence that The X-Files have had on television. It was truly a wonderful ride."
2,another disappointment,"When we got this toy, my son was excited. The only problem was, one of the gloves did not work. I read on the box that the batteries are for ""demonstration"" purposes only and may not work, but when I swapped batteries from one glove to another, it did not fix the problem.I called the manufacturer, and they said they could do nothing within a reasonable time frame, but I could return it for an even exchange. That would be fine if a local store stocked it, but it won't be easy. Many manufacturers handle problems a lot better. Considering that my son got two products from the same company, the same day, and both were defective (the other was a Doc Ock posable figure,) I'd personally question whether the quality is really there."
5,GREAT TOY !,"This is the funniest, greatest toy my son received from Santa this year. He just turned 5 and seems to be the perfect age and fit for this toy. It is so great to see him running around doing fancy kicks and punches and having the grunting and punching sounds just occur, as if naturally. This is one of my great buys. He waited six months for Christmas to arrive to get this -- worth the wait!"
4,Super mini speaker for laptops/mp3 players,"This Creative Labs Travelsound i300 speaker system is awesome.Sound is superb, battery life is great, and it looks good too.Due to its compact size, it fits in your backpack or laptop bagwithout any problem.It would have received 5 stars from me if it had higher wattage,like maybe 6 watts output, instead of 4 watts."
4,Nice little gadget!,"These speakers are great for the common traveller and have great clean music. the only reason I did not give this 5 stars is because it doesn;t fofill the height of volume I wished. It is pretty loud, but I like really loud. I do not own this but one of my friends does I hoe to get logi3 i station for my ippod it seems awsome according to the reviews."
1,"GOD, HELP!","I bought this video thinking it might be a worthwhile one. Surely, hot babes in sand couldn't be all that disappointing, i've been to Mexico you know? Anyhow, this movie absolutely was the most disgraceful exploit of nude women ever...most of the time, they weren't even nude...pish! Luckily, I only spent a minimal on it with a Gift Card, but I still feel gipped. Save your money, get something else! Something better...anything better...I swear, Mrs. Doubtfire is more erotic!"
1,Cheap and Dull Finish,I ordered two sets of the Salad Servers to go with my flatware which I have owned for quite sometime and like very much.I was therefore stunned to receive these pieces which were nice in size but dull and had a cheap finish to them. Since I ordered two and they were both the same horrible finish I can only conclude they all come finished in this tacky finish.I want my money back x two.
4,Almost Perfect,"This lens is a close to a ""does it all"" lens that you could ask for. The only wish I could have for this lens would be the addition of image stabilization. Otherwise I find it a wonderful walk around and vacation travel lens for my camera. I don't go anywhere without it."
2,picture quality issue,"I bought this lens for its great reviews and unbeatable price. However, after a couple weeks of extensive test shots at various settings I decided to return it. The picture quality is the main reason. Actually I decided not to pursue the type of all around lens (18-200+).Pros: versatile, portability, build quality and priceCons: picture sharpness issue, lens creeping, and no image stabilization."
2,could be better,"after research i figured the lens would be pretty good, but after testing it out for 2.5 weeks, i was very disappointed in the quailty of my pictures. pictures weren't as sharp as i would have hoped they would be. i ended up returning the lens."
2,"Erroneous and badly written, not recommended","BSCI 642-801 is a tough exam and the combination of topics makes it tough to remember everything. This newer Clare Gough book is worse, please do not buy it, get a copy of the CD from someone and practise the questions from the CD.Clare Gough does not cover NAT or IPV6, and the written text is very dry, and riddled with errors.I would read Paquet and Teare book on BSCN,(...)Then for IPV6 I would use the web. Finally use the Gough CD to practise questions.For NAT my recommendation is: Jeff Doyle routing Volume 2, though you do not need to read the whole long winded chapter for the 642-801 requirement.Final suggestion is make your last minutes notes while reading from all these sources as having all the material in one place for the final study helps."
2,"NOT at all easy to read, look no further","I see all the reviews about this book. Where do people find the time to write such a lengthy article. I will make this short and sweet.The author does not make this book easy to read. I thought if I read the entire book maybe it will all come together...NOT. Even after reading the entire book, I found myself wondering if it was worth the time and money I put into this book. I should have returned this book when I had a chance.I bought this book becuase I needed a refresher course and to recertify my CCNP. I plan to take the BSCI test again just as a review. This book is of very little help. I book is not worth the effort. Don't take a chance! Short and sweet!"
3,it doesnt cover everthing..,"I did read this book entire, my practice tests score were average of 98 to 100%, but I did not pass the exam.I noted that some questions of the exam are not covered in this book, such as some concepts of IPV6, RIP and so on. So I think it is a complementary book. Dont try to pass the exam using ONLY this book just like I did.I will try the exam again in this month, but I will refer to other guides too, such as sybex, just like I did in CCNA preparation."
4,"Quirky, but awesome","The thing to keep in mind with this particular variety of Gelly Roll is that they ARE NOT GLOSSY. The finish is similar to Tempra paint, so you must allow a layer to completely dry (dries pretty fast though) before you apply another layer. That second layer will be necessary however, because the pasty consistency will cause you to push little lines through to the paper/background. However, the colors are fully steadfast. I used these on some street art stickers, and left them out in the elements; the marks I made with Sharpie ink markers faded before the marks I made with these. Just keep in mind that the Moonlights do have a sort of matte or no-gloss finish. I would rank them third, just below the metallic and Glaze variety (If you don't have the glaze, get them! They are translucent but so nice)."
5,awesome,"my reviews are getting more and more depressing as i go down the page, this is really boring, a total buzz kill...yippy for neon gelly roll gel pens..."
4,"Good pens, Not great for blacklight","I bought these pens in order to create blacklight posters, only a few really glow under blacklight and the rest glow better than other pens I've seen but still not well. I use these gel pens all the time on art projects because they are rather bright and do look beautiful. If you just need some unusually bright gel pens get these because while the dark colors arn't much different the yellow, orange, pink, and a couple others are very bright and eye appealing. However, if your looking for blacklight pens like I was, go look for neon, or something that says blacklight in the title unless you only need a few bright colors. (orange and yellow glow under blacklight wonderfully)"
4,Noise Suppressor,I tried this on the transducer cord of a side imaging fishing sonar to try and stop interferance from the electric troll motor...It seemed to help by reducing interferance by 75% ..I used 2 of them
3,"Works, but that's about all you can say for it","I guess you get what you pay for. It works in that it reads the temperature, but it's hard to get it clipped on properly so that the tip doesn't touch the bottom of the pan, and it steams up inside so that it's hard to read. The glass also seems pretty thin, though I haven't had it break on me. If you're just getting into candy making, go for it. If you think you'll use a candy thermometer more than a few times, get something else. I've used mine 3 or 4 times now and I'm already looking at replacing it with something nicer."
3,Beware of clean-up,"The Good:I have used this rack many times, It is well made and holds 4 racks of ribs.The Bad: It is a royal pain to clean. I do not use it as much as I could because of the clean-up. The rack will stick to the meat (I only use a dry rub)in spots. After 6 hours of smoking you need to be careful with removing the ribs. With all this, I could not smoke more than 2 racks of ribs without this rack."
2,Check dimensions,This thing looks to be well built but it is too big for my char-broil smoker. It is even too big for use on my Weber Genesis Silver grill unless I leave the lid up. If you are planning on using it for one of those two make sure you understand the dimensions of the thing.
5,PREpared,"For us, getting ready for an off-highway trip is part of the overal fun for the trip itself. We also travel with two 4-paw drive Rovers, the Labs, so something that includes ""packing for your dog"" sparked our interest right off the bat.If you're new to venturing off on paths less traveled or looking for ways to improve your current game plan, this DVD will help you make the choices to have an enjoyable and safe time.I've been camping/traveling off-highway now for longer than I care to remember. The topics covered like what to pack in a bug-out pack let alone the importance of having one, made me more aware of how to be better PREpared for our trips.Very cool DVD.Jaime"
4,"Paranoia, paranoia, everybody's comin' to get me",I bought this because I was paranoid about wired radiation from my cell phone. I now use a Bluetooth hands-free solution built into my car and I don't use this anymore.
1,xd picture card,"I have an Olympus camera which only takes xd picture cards. Unfortunately, it will not work w/this size."
5,A Little Bush Maid,"I had this book when I was quite young, and lost it. I did not expect it to be as ""good"" now that I am much older, but I found it as entertaining as I did 50 years ago. I found the other books in the series, and bought them, too. An interesting and accurate look into Australia and England set before and during WW1 through the eyes of a teen-aged girl"
1,Only 3 pages on how to write your application!,This book promises to help you with a tough task such as getting a cruise ship job. That's why I wonder HOW you can write an attention-grabbing application when the author provides you only with 3 pages tips on cover letter and resume writing. If he has been lucky enough to get a job I doubt that anything from the brief advice in the book and the 5 years old addresses and telephone numbers will help YOU to achieve the same result. If you really want to get a cruise ship employment the only book which I feel confident to recommend in written form is the category's bestseller- Cruise Ship Job in 14 Days.
1,My Back Hurts,"I can't even believe you are looking at this page now! If you searched for this CD, you know exactly what to expect. I just went the rating system went lower than 1 star. Lisa's okay, but why is this on CD now? Suckdog's best offering to the universe is giving untalented punk hopefuls a false sense of confidence in thinking ""if someone bought this junk, they are sure to buy my junk!"" ..."
1,latino hotline,"I listen to the cd,its abc of latin rap.it basically the same beats.I did not feel the beats,I found it boring.I say save your money on this one.We have came a long way in the rap industry,Sucio rapping is stuck in the 1980's."
3,TQM Safety,"I used this book for an environmental safety class in a graduate program. I was not familiar with this discipline before this class. In the first chapter the concept is layed out, however it was not an easy reader. Too many bullets and questions. It seemed to apply more for the safety manager already employed. The ideas were a little hard to grasp as a student without a lot of experience. The OSHA website helped me to get a grip on the ideas."
1,Frustrating...,"This book has 2,500 deities listed! Seems like a lot. It certainly is fun to flip through. Encyclopaedias, however, are intended as resource material for when we have specific questions. Many many times I have not been able to find a deity of interest. Many many times I have found the entries to be far too brief and bereft of significant information. Furthermore, there is no index!!! Cross referencing is impossible with this book. To date, I have found my copy to be virtually useless."
1,Bad Experience,"Many of the crackers were broken, which is probably close to unavoidable. But what really got me was the fact that not every package was full, and each package had a few crackers that were burned. They also smelled ""off"". I'm not sure what the expiration date was as there was none on the package. Very disappointed. In my opinion, a much better product is the Koyo brand organic rice crackers."
5,Brown Rice Snaps,"These crackers are gluten free, fat free, and sodium free. They are so flavorful and crunchy. Brown rice is much more nutritious than white rice. GREAT PURCHASE!!!!"
3,Gluten-free?!,"I don't think that products should be allowed to use ""gluten-free"" on their labels if they are ""Manufactured in a facility that may make other products containing wheat"". If they share the equipment, no matter how well cleaned there is a substantial risk of them being contaminated with gluten, and therefore, especially for the most sensitive celiacs/gluten-intolerant people, NOT REALLY GLUTEN-FREE!Gastro-intestinal roulette?(It only takes a small amount of gluten equal to the size of one grain of rice to do damage.)This product and others like it should be labeled ""wheat-free"" only, not ""gluten-free""."
3,Where are the women?????????????????????,"My brother passed away over two years ago and I inherited a lot of his old VHS tapes, CD's DVD's etc. Mindcrime itself was one VHS tape so I watched it and was good. I have a few Queensryche albums and I think they are really a great band overall......at least very ambitious. All of the members are great with their instruments/voices.I happened to catch this on the VH1 channel I believe. They came out fast pace rocking. The drummer must sleep for days after one of their concerts. The songs were good and again musicianship stellar.But one question? Where are the girls?? All I saw was dudes which kind of made me think that this band must be promoting more in the way of a certain sexuality.........or something? Anyway, that is their thing and maybe all the dudes at this concert thought bringing a girl along might get in the way of their rocking out.Headbangers in mullets and young as you can get. I bet half of them were driven to the concert by mom."
5,Ryche at the high of their career.,Awesome live concert filmed at their all time peak! outstanding set list and master quality film production make this a must for the true Queensryche fan.
3,Good for a novice Baan consultant,"This book is a very good source on Baan for a novice and moderate practitioner. Some modules like Baan Project are not covered much. On the contrary modules like Baan Finance are covered at length. Moreover the modules are not structured as they are in Baan. This makes it a bit difficult to follow through. Since this is the first book on Baan, the efforts of the author are appreciable in compiling the information on such a massive ERP application."
2,"Very good ""OLD"" book","Very ""old"" good book and approch to an ERP system. But BaaN Software, with BaaN Serie is very quiet different now. Tools and Process explanation is to poor for a good understanding."
4,wow,very thought provoking...a must read for people who really want to know about public health and how the system (government) treated ( and perhaps to this day) treat the less privileged
5,AWESOME,"I got this DVD a few days ago and its awesome! i've watched it like 10 times already! If you're an N Sync fan you HAVE TO have this!!!! If you thought the Madison Square Garden concert was good, wait'll you see this!!!!!!!!!!The stage is 10 times better, so is the sound, vocals, and dancing. Buy it!"
2,Hopes were higher,"Well, I don't know if the DVD is going to have extra things on it, but as for the VHS, I'm disappointed, to say the least. Whoever wrote the details for this item, claimed that it follows the guys on their tour, showing us the work that goes into such a big concert. Backstage footage was VERY limited to quick nano second shots between songs. THAT was it! I went to 3 of their Pop Odyssey concerts, so I was hoping for extra things from the guys. They are all so funny, and fun to watch especially when they aren't performing, it would have been way cooler if they would've included a little bit of them either before or after the show, even a measley 10 minutes would have satisfied me! I know Joey's brother tapes almost everything they do, how bout a cut from some of that footage???? I'd buy it! Afterall, I bought this, and even tho it pales in comparison to other footage of them,I'd still buy it again because it is, afterall, NSYNC!"
3,Not as good as MSG concert DVD,"This NSYNC concert was good, but not as good as the Madison Square Garden concert. The songs from the upcoming Celebrity album could have been performed better. Pop, the opening song suffers from too many explosions, especially the fireworks exploding 3 times to such overblown effect. The other album's songs sounded better in this concerts than the then new 2001 material. Plus the big ball tossing in the audience is a little annoying to see. While Celebrity has better material, the group just didn't translate the songs to a live setting that well. That's why I watch the New York concert more than this concert. Plus the reading of fan letters on various parts of the arena seems pointless in this show--they should focus more on the music rather than the filler that they did in this show. The ballad performances come off as bland and some of the dance numbers lack some passion. So save your money and buy the NYC show instead."
5,Awesome. Their best yet!,"This DVD is so awesome. First of all, the special features are off the hook [Chris is hilarious] and the concert is amazing. I went to the show on June 26 and I couldn't remember all the songs [b4 the album came out...] and this concert is incredible. The camera-ing was a little bad but *NSYNC has so much electrical junk that it was kinda impossible to record. But overall this was one of the best musical DVDs I've ever purchased...along with the HBO ""No Strings Attached"" concert. Check that out too!! They're awesome. I love NSYNC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
