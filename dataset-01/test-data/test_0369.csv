3,kinda bad but addictive,"the entire twilight series is what i like to call ""hillarible"" (hilarious/horrible) but they are also addictive to read. i actually enjoy the story though it is a bit cheesy. they aren't the most well-written books ever but that helps make them an easy read. i HAVE recommend them to a few people but with the disclaimer that they are a kinda lame and that they are what my dad would call 'smut books' but without any of the ""good"" smutty parts!"
5,Another love story,"What is the big deal. Some girl falls in love with a ugly vegetable vampire named Edward. She can't love him, then in the end they'll be together. Don't see what the hype was about. I thought this would be a good book! What's the fuss?! I would rate it -5 stars if I could. You call that a book?! few things1. It's a love story like any other but with vampires. So I could write a love story with goblins then it'll be a hit?!2. What's the apple?3. Doesn't Edward have any personality?! What a vegetable!"
2,Look elsewhere for good vampire fiction (as if there existed nonfiction),"I will not bore you with complaining about the plot or lack there of. In fact that isn't even the largest gripe I have with this novel. Simply put, the writing is absolute dribble, in fact I'm sure that a real 17 year old in love with a vampire could have told her tale better. The entire book read like a really long (and especially poorly written) teen magazine article.I'm glad that so many people find this novel readable, but I recommend Mary Downing Hahn -I originally wrote Mary Higgins Clark, two many middle named marys- (Look for me by Moonlight), Bram Stoker's Dracula, or Nabokov's Lolita if you are looking for the forbidden love fantasy.I apologize for being such a lit snob, but I just was so disappointed with this book after loving the vampire romance genre as a teen and I want others to enjoy the good this genre has to offer."
2,Boring,"I read the first part of this novel 4 days ago and I've already forgotten the plot and storyline for most of the book. That just gives you an idea of how awful I thought it was. And then I remembered who the intended audience for this book was - young teens and so I gave this book 2 stars instead of one. The characters, from Bella to Edward are shallow and empty. They lack the richness of some other similarly themed books I've read. Don't expect to find anything on the level of Anne Rice here, because her writing in this book is very generic and formulaic as far as vampire romance novels go and I feel Twilight has been done in similar fashion zillions of times over. I was looking for fresh perspective on vampire romances and would have been satisfied with just a great set of characters but instead I just came up bored and yawning after a few hours of reading. I really did feel like everything i read was predictable. I really don't understand why so many people like this series."
3,Twilight,"Bit disappointing really I prefer the paperback version of this book because it has more detail and and there are a few bits missing as I have,watched the,film and,book a good few,times."
1,Horriblely written fanfiction that somehow got published.,"After 500 pages of the main character, Bella, whining about how unperfect she is (she is beautiful and smart by the way) and how absolutely perfect her love interest is, Edward, I was relieved to finally close the book for good and trash the thing. From sparkly vampires to whiney Mary-Sues this crappy somehow-got-published-fanfiction is a definately must-skip. Don't get brainwashed by the huge hype for the film or the hordes of fangirls, they don't know what a good novel is."
2,Maybe next time...,"I will admit I did enjoy this book, to an extent. It was the only book of the series that I enjoyed because it focused on their relationship. However she loses that focus and takes no risks in the series. So I have very little respect for Meyer's writing, very very poor. My comments go much more in depth in the following book reviews because they get worse and worse in quality."
1,I expcted more,Every one told me to read this book . What a waste of my time. It was sooooooo boring and flat.After many good comments. I thought it was a romance I mean a vampire almost killing her . Her love cant keep from kiling her.I HATE It I I hate it. 1 through 5 stars id give it a negitve 10.Dont waste your time.
5,AMAZING!!!,"okay one word this book was great i got it after i saw the movie and the movie was amazing the begging is a little slow to get going but once you start reading it get well additcing i have to say. I LOVED IT!! the begging is a little slow thow but, once you start reading it is AMAZING!!! :D i read the whole series."
5,Yes,"I appreciate a good story without worrying about what my teenage daughter is reading. Kudos to Stephanie Meyer, and thank you!"
1,What is the hype?,"I really wanted to enjoy this book, so I can read the whole series. What a waste of time, I didn't even like the main character. Terrible book for teens. The girl is honestly not nice, and follows a wrong type of guy. Words are written over and over....How gorgeous Edward is, his crooked smile, come on, we get it. Terrible, don't get suckered in the hype, I wasted my money."
2,Somewhat disappointed,"I decided upon seeing the August release for the final book of the series, that maybe I should try this book. I was actually disappointed and not wholly pleased with the main character Bella. I thought she was whiny and angsty at the beginning. Yes I know she's a teenager but still I thought Stephanie Meyer would eventually have the character develop and become something more.I read the next book New Moon as well hoping well maybe Bella would develop in this one. Not really.Bottom line: If you enjoy paranormal fiction, its overall entertaining but you might feel like the author should kill the main character off"
3,need an actual book summary from twilight,you know I came here for an actual review and summary to twlight the first in this series. What I got was a bunch of quotes and things pieced together from the whoele series - very confusing if you havent read them.and I dont CARE what Meyers watched or didnt before writing these books - frankly I cant respect any vamp writer who hasnt at least watched BTVS or anything - does this lady live under a rock?!I came here for an actual summary for said title and all I have seen was wasted space and geeking out teens who dont care that Edward really doesnt love Bella as much as he loves her blood.
2,Did not live up to the hype!,"I thought I would final read the series after hearing all the great reviews. I really had difficulty getting into the story, but I did make it through the first book. I guess I was expecting more since there was such hype, but I think after reading Anne Rice it is a little difficult to live up to Rice's caliber."
1,Not for 11 or 12 year old Girls,"I was turned on to this my a friend whose[...] daughter LOVES it. I read it to preview it for my own child. The themes of this book are not approproate for this age group, in my opinion. Bella lies to her father, runs away with the vampires, and her only goal is to be basically killed for a teenage crush. I cannot give this the nod for young impressionable children. I think it sends the wrong message. Maybe ok for older teens. I've said my peace."
1,"Bad plot lines, terrible characters and poorly written","Ugg. It was bad. I kept expecting more because of the twilight craze. Just when I thought it couldn't get worse, it did. Do not read."
4,Vampire Love Story,"I really enjoy all of Stephanie Meyer's books in the Twilight Series. It is a fast paced book that explores the idea that vampires and wolves live among us. At the heart of the story, however, is a traditional love story between two people, which is what I enjoyed most about this series."
1,Twilight,I just think everyone needs to read more if they think this book was so great. Unfortunately I don't think I will buy another book of Ms. Meyer's. The book was a gift so I felt I needed to read the book. If I had bought it myself it would never had gotten read. Ms. Meyer could have left out half the book and it would have turned out a lot better. The only part that held my interest was the very last. If people want to read it I think it is fine. I just do not think I would buy anymore of her books.
5,"Not positive why I love them, but I do!","Not positive why I love them, but I do! The movies are horrible (but I still watch them), the books are so much better!"
5,Deliriously wonderful,"I stayed up until 4am because I had to finish reading this book. Twilight is so capturing, that I refused to put the book down. Somehow you fall in love with Edward, even though he is intensly scary at some points. If you want a book that will keep you guessing until the last page I highly recommend Twilight."
4,A Moody Fantasy/Love Story,"I wasn't expecting much from this book, but I was pleasantly surprised. It had a very honest feel to it in spite of the fact that it is a vampire story. The interactions between teens and the emotions it portrays felt very real and when it ended I was already looking forward to the next installment!"
4,Twilight,Once I got into the story of Edward and Bella I did enjoy it. I just found it a very hard book to get into. I found I could leave it for a while and come back to it. It wasn't the type of book that grabbed me and I couldn't put it down until I finished it. I have now read all of the Twilight series books and I found them all to be hard to get into but once the story picked up they were very good and I did enjoy them and the first movie.
1,Awful.,"This is a sad attempt at literature and basically nothing more then lame Young Adult abstinence porn. I have read Harlequin romance novels with better character development, plot, and overall writing style. Bella MarySue! is boring, does not develop as a character, and whines constantly throughout the entire series. She relies on men to save her and defines herself based on the value that CreepyStalker! Edward places on her.Oh, and girls, as a side note...any man that sneaks into your house to watch you sleep is not a romantic guy. Just imagine waking up to see a set of strange eyes grazing over your body. Yikes."
1,amazing,when i started this story i never imagined how much it would touch me. i never wanted it to end
3,Audio Reader,"The book itself is great but the reader, Ilyana Kadushin, ruins the whole thing. She has the same voice for all characters, as if she is holding the book right infront of her and just reading. I am an avid audiobook listener and Ilyana is NOT good at this and because of her I will not be buying the rest of the series. This is a shame because Stephenie Meyers has done a great job. Personally I think the audiobook should be reread by Laural Merlington or even Dick Hill, who know how to put themselves into all the characters and you know who is talking without hearing their names. They all have a seperate voice, as if it were seperate individuals playing the part. I know I am only one person, but this is my opinion.Stephanie"
1,Nothing left to say,"The negative reviews have really done a great job describing my feelings for this book (and series). I don't feel I have any more to add, but wanted my vote to count.Terrible, terrible books. If you want your daughters to read love stories give them something decent like Austen."
2,Boring,"I like a good Vampire romance. They are light and good way to wind down before bed. I don't even mind decent fiction for young adults as there are good stories to be had; so I bought this book because of the reviews. Well, it's awful. Is this really what our teen aged girls are like? I wasn't and my daughter wasn't. This is just plain pathetic."
1,Disappointed,"I had so many friends that raved about this book, that I finally read it myself. I was greatly disappointed. I thought the writing was very juvenile and the characters were very shallow. I don't like weak feminine roles, which the main character, Bella, is. She is pretty, but doesn't know it- please! How stupid is that? She faints/trips/injures herself all the time. She falls for Edward based purely on his looks. They soon develop a very dependent relationship- their relationship is not based on common interests or values. They just instantly fall in love and cannot be separated. I do not want my daughters to read this and think that true love means to be infatuated with someone and that they should hold our for the ""perfect"" person. I just thought the book was very childish and lacked depth."
5,twilight,I wasn't sure i would like these books. after the first one i was hooked. I have passed them to all my friends and older daughters to read as well. stephanie meyer is such a talented writer.
1,This book is horrible.,"I cannot believe the hype that surrounds these books or the associated franchise. These novels are written at a [...] reading level - the vocabulary is poor, the sentence structure is completely dull and monotonous, and there is no literary flourish.While Edward does the occasional chivalrous, heroic act, his behavior seems overall overprotective, condescending, and stalker-ish. Ask yourself this: would you think it romantic if after your next first date you found the guy hiding in your bedroom to watch you sleep? Or would you call the police...? I certainly hope my future daughter/son does not think Edward's behavior is endearing or acceptable.That being said, Twilight is a very quick read and the story itself is somewhat creative. One-third through I completely altered my expectations which then made its inanity rather amusing. Read with a grain, or shaker, of salt."
3,good but not GREAT,"I bought this book because I had seen previews to the movie and you always hear that the book is better than the movie. First of all this book was 498 pages, told in the first person and is very detailed. I wont give a blow by blow of all those details here as many others have given reviews of the book.I will simply say that it was too much of a teen drama to suit me. Bella's character was a bit annoying and pouty for me,with Edward and the Cullen's being way more interesting. The book didn't really get good until well over half way through when it's finally reveiled that they are in fact vampires and we introduce the danger factor.Overall, well written, the story just didn't snag me. I won't be reading book 2."
2,A waste of my valuable time!,"I truly only suffered through the reading of this book because I paid for it. I wouldn't say it was the WORST read of my life but it is pretty darn close. The character development is weak and the theme lacking and repetitive to a nauseating degree. I'd suggest waiting for it to come out in its movie form (yes, I've heard they are making a movie of this book) and THEN wait for it to come out as a rental - or even better - free on HBO, Showtime, Starz - or whatever other premium channel you have."
2,Good premise but too melodramatic and not a healthy love relationship,"You know, I really wanted to like this book. I work at a high school and noticed lots of girls reading it so I borrowed a copy and settled down, hoping to discover an author that I could be excited about. It started, I thought, rather slowly, and while I admit it held my attention enough to keep me reading (I have no problem putting a book down that doesn't hold my attention) I never felt a real desire to stop doing things and read it. And the love story is so immature and juvenile! Of course I realize that might be the intent of the author and that might be why it appeals especially to young girls but after a while I found it to be one dimensional and just not interesting.So this reader will not be following the corny and melodromatic saga of Bella Swan."
5,Twilight,"A terrific hook and got me into the book, unable to put it down. A great book for young fantasy readers no fear moms no deep and dark sex or blood orgies"
5,Twilight Must Have,"For a true hardcore fan of the Twilight books. Beautifully put together, lovely little extras with the rough cut pages, ribbon and artwork."
3,Interesting story but not well written,Interesting story but not particularly well written. This was the first vampire novel I have read and I am glad I did in spite of what I consider inferior writing.
5,Great book,This is a really good book cant wait to read the next one. Big thanks to stephenie meyer for writing a book that fits me.
1,Sucked,"A complete and total waste of time. A complete distruction of all good things about vapires, books, ect. I died a litle inside when I read this"
4,A really good read!,"I'm usually a noir and mystery nut, but I heard a lot of hype about this series, and kept seeing the displays at the book store, so after a while I just gave in and ordered a copy.Since this wasn't my ""genre"" I really didn't know what to expect, so I put it off. After a while I finally just picked the book up off the shelf and dove in.I found that it immediately grabbed me. I read for about 4 hours, slept, then finished the book in two other sittings. (Yes, it's that good.)If you are on the edge, and don't really know if you will like it, I say get it, you will be sure to enjoy it.This would make a great beach read.I'm looking forward to reading book two very soon.Happy reading!"
3,A good concept poorly executed,"I enjoyed Twilight. Really. It's a captivating story. The only problem is that Stephenie Meyer can't write, and that's annoying. Her most obvious mistake is trying to write in the first person. While she seems to get ""I"" and ""me"" in the right places, the voice doesn't ring true. Too much of the language doesn't fit the character. I don't imagine many 17-year-old girls actually use the phrase ""estrogen rush"" to describe a night out with the girls. Beyond that, she relies on too many adjectives plucked out of a thesaurus and not comfortably situated on the page. Do read the book; it's entertaining despite the abysmal prose. Just don't expect to see it in the annals of great literature, as it won't be there."
2,Maybe if I was 12,"Hearing all the hype, I was hoping for another series like Harry Potter. I was immensely disappointed. The writing doesn't compare. This book does not seem to be for all age groups nor does it cross the male/female gender gap. If you are a pre-teen girl its for you- but that's it."
3,"Good story and Characters, but too slow","After reading Twilight, I decided to read some of the amazon reviews to see what other people thought about the book.I'm actually surprised by the amount of negative reviews, because I thought the characters and plot was pretty creative, and the writing was well-done.However, after thinking about it for a while, I see there is somwhat of a problem. The book starts off too slowly. In fact, you have to read at least three hundred pages before any real action develops. I remember learning in creative writing 101 that great writing catches the reader quickly. Although there is good writing here, Twilight doesn't catch you quickly enough."
2,Good love story - problematic vampire story,"In order to rate this book fairly, I will keep in mind that it was written for teens. From that perspective, it was a good love story riddled with the infectious but immature themes of unconsummated love and all-consuming passion that the young find so compelling. Of course, I would worry about any adult woman who would find this sort of love anything but creepy and suffocating.It would be nice if Meyer and other authors of vampire stories could agree upon some ""rules"" governing vampire behavior. These days, authors arbitrarily reinvent vampires to suit their own narcissistic story telling, causing these already mythical creatures to become simultaneously everything and nothing at all. Vampires need a clear identity for the legend to remain interesting. Let's decide on a definition for vampires and stick with it, shall we? It seems lazy to do otherwise."
2,It's just OK,"After seeing all the hype for this I decided to check it out. The story was ok, nothing gripping about it. The first 2/3 of the book was mostly about the new gal in school and the kids that no one talks to because they are so mysterious. Towards the end it picked up a bit. I'm glad I read it but it is not one of my favorite reads. I can see young teenaged girls getting excited about this but that's about it. Much better vamp books out there."
3,As the sun sets,"OK...I'm one of the few non-females to read this book. My wife and many of her friends would push this into the 5 star category. I'm between 2 and 3 stars.It's definitely an enjoyable and well-crafted story with endearing characters. Meyer creates a lovable heroine that her target audience of women and girls can relate to and sympathize with. Then she pairs her with a gallant and chivalrous hero trying desperately to reconcile his love with his sense of self.For the male audience, the romantic twinges are a bit over-the-top and pull us back to reality while we try to deal with saccharine overdose. Still, the intrigue and bits of action and suspense can keep even the least emotional male invested enough to see the story through.I enjoyed it and will eventually read the rest of the series, but I wasn't caught in the ""can't put it down"" mode that my wife and many other readers found themselves."
4,This book was worth the two days!,"I think this book was well worth the two days I spent reading it. I am excited to move on to the next. Stephenie Meyer has a real talent for painting a picture with her words. I feel she is a great writer. The story may be a little on the corny side, but then again I am not a young adult. I did thoroughly enjoy the book and didn't want to put it down. For those who complain of wasting their money, get a library card. It's free! Great job Stephenie."
3,Not too good,"This book was only ok. It lacked good writing. I felt the story line was the only thing that kept me interesterd. The characters were not well developed and I had a hard time understanding the strong connections between the characters(ex: edward and bella). I think there are many other books out there that are better than this, a silent ocean away, to kill a mockingbird and walk two moons. But that is just my opinion:-)"
2,What's with all the hype?,"I wanted to really love this book because I love vampires and romance novels...but this is incredibly boring and dragged out. The premise of the book could make a really mind numbing experience but the author doesn't seem to put much thought into a main focus of the story. The characters are very typical and have no personality. The book just repeats itself until the last couple of chapters when they meet the random vampires. It's almost like the editor said ""insert plot here"" it seemed so disconnected. Ages ago I read Christopher Pikes Last Vampire series and even though that was aimed a little younger it was sooo much better and actually had real twists with consequences. If you want to somewhat enjoy this book skip the first half of filler. you won't miss much, all you need to know is Edward is hot and Bella is physically attracted him."
5,Amazing,"Stephenie Meyer has me biting my nails waiting for her third book to be released; her story grabs your imagination and refuses to let go. Unlike most all romance novels, Twilight isn't predictable. From the first minute you meet the characters you fall in love with them. I've never read anything like it and since this is Meyer's first book ever published, I hope the series never ends."
1,A very poorly written teen novel with inappropriate adult themes,I've read many of the 1 star reviews of this book and agree wholeheartedly with them. I cannot understand how this book was published (at all) and marketed to the 12 and up market. The very thought of my daughter reading this book sends shivers down my spine for so many reasons. The redundancy of the text in this novel is downright boring. The only reason I persevered was to try and find out what all the hype was about. Having finished the book I was left scratching my head and wondering how on earth this book has become so popular.
1,I don't get this at all,"This review will be short and simple, since so many other people have already excellently and eloquently explained why this book is bad. All I want to say is: I don't get it. Why is this so popular? Sure, it is obviously aimed at 14-17 year old girls, but writing for that age group doesn't mean that you have to come up with such lousy material. I am definitely not part of the target demographic, but I still do enjoy material for it as long as it is executed well. This isn't. So what is going on? Has there been an epidemic brain drain among adolescent girls?The only advantage for me personally is that I don't feel that bad anymore about my own novels. They may be lame, contrived and poorly written, but if even stuff like this tops the best-seller lists I may still have a chance."
1,Sexist YA Novel of the 21st Century,"Between the helpless female protagonist and her vampire stalking, controlling boyfriend; Twilight is enough to make any young feminist want to vomit. The purple prose Ms. Meyer uses in her book doesn't help either."
3,"best series, until......","well when i first read the book and series i was so into it but after awhile, and i read other books, the series and writing style wasnt to great. i realized i was caught up in the excitment and everything. dont get me wrong though, i still like it it just isnt the best. i have now read a great many books now that are better than the twilight saga. but i would reccomend this book to anyone who practiccly likes every book they read, like me. conclusion: it is a series that picks you up in the excitement but then sooner than later it gently plops you back down."
4,Nice read...,"I have to admit that I watched the movie first and was curious about how the book would be. Hands down, the book is far better. I also have to admit this is the only vampire series I would think about reading. I'm just not that into vampire romances like some people. I know if I were merely a teenager, I probably would have thought this book to have been excellent, but alas, I'm just a grownup and can't bring myself to give this five stars ONLY because I felt the ending of it was RUSHED and thrown together. Other than that, I thought Ms. Myer did an excellent job with characters, feelings and an overall feel to the book."
2,Not so crazy about the audiobook,"I absolutely love these books but was pretty disappointed with the audio version. Unfortunately, the narrator *sounds* like she's reading straight from the book and doesn't do a great job acting the characters' parts.I've listened to a lot of audiobooks, and this is one I struggled to finish; hoping it would improve."
5,Love it,"I love these cases. Have had one for over 15 years, it keeps cds in my car safe and sound. Bought this one for dvds. Great product."
1,Extreme disappointment,"I waited with great anticipation for the release of this latest book in the series, only to think that I was sent an incomplete novel when I ripped open the box. The book a very short; double-spaced with unnecessary pages for chapter numbers. In addition to being short the book adds zero depth to the story of Anita Blake. The last few books contained more sex than storyline but I held on to the hope that Laurell would redeem herself with Micah. I was wrong. The main topic of the book is the width of Micah's member and his tramatic past; which in comparison to the horrors that occurred before, is the least tramatic experience I have read throughout the series. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed, unentertained (I finished the book in two hours) and you will be too. Rather than ""force"" a book Laurell take a break and save everyone time and money."
1,Not up to the usual quality.,I just discovered this series---read 5 of them then ordered the rest. There is lots of great sex and violence---it has been a fun month reading all 18 books---but of all of them---I should have skipped this one. It was really a short story---excessive line space and margins. I read the whole thing in an hour.
2,Micah Missed,"I actually like Micah. I was excited about this book, desperately hoping that it would bring into light what for me is a mysterious and engaging character. It missed that mark. Completely. There is no plot. That would be okay if the book was a nice, introspective look at Micah, but it isn't. It's merely another outlet for the same old Anita emotional issues that we all hope she'll grow out of. Because that's what characteres do - they grow and not just in power.I think Hamilton is a very gifted storyteller who probably was under a lot of pressure from her publisher. I look forward to the book in June, and I hope that it will give us more of Micah. However, after the sneak peek offered in today's release I'm afraid I won't be getting what I want.Lastly, I don't appreciate paying $7.99 for an hour and a half read. No, sir."
3,too short a read,"I have read all of L. Hamilton's book to date and found this one disappointing in its brevity. I am used to several plot lines and some drama. This lacked both. While I enjoyed learning more about Micah, I felt cheated by the quick storyline. The intro to her next book at the end of this one was actually more interesting."
1,Took a chance,I have read many of Hamilton's books and bought the book against all the bad reviews. Worst book I have read.
5,Mmmm... leopards,I was glad to see she spent some time on Micah... I really like him as a 'person' and was glad to hear her tell his story finally.
2,"small book, big err....","I like the character Micah. I'm really bored with hearing about his, err, outstandingly large physical attributes. In fact, I'd love for a character in one of Ms Hamilton's books to be average."
1,It is the worse book of the series,"I never rated any book but after reading this one, I must do it. If it is just to warn the other readers how bad this book is! If I could, I would have asked for my money back. I know I am being too harsh! However, you would too if you have been a fan of Anita Blake's books from the beginning and then you open this book and see that it was a big waste of money. The little that his book explained about Micah could be incorporated in one paragraph in her next book Dance Macabre. The book has no action scenes, no plot and it finishes drastically short. It seems like Laurell Hamilton when wrote this book really was not thinking about her fans but was simply thinking in making a quick cash. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK, it's too short and too crappy"
3,OK...better than Incubus Dreams...,"There isnt much to add that other havent said, its not up to the standards of the others,it should have been a short story there was alot of space fillers, thankfully its better than Incubus Dreams but thats not saying much. It was 40% Micah's body and big MEMBER huge MALE MEMBER...40% sex, 10% Anita whinning and 10% PLOT. The plot had potential much like in her last book but was given no attention.....I was one of those that wanted more sex in the series but not at the cost of EVERYTHING else....:("
1,Ms Hamilton was better before she got married.,"We certainly can make a case for author's not getting married or divorced.I have seen examples where good authors who were married, thanked their spouses for all their patience, etc in first few books. Then a divorce occurred, and their writting stunk from that time on.Only in this case, I think marriage did Ms Hamilton in. A couple years ago, I noted with interest and good wishes that she had gotten married, but since then her writting has suffered and continues to suffer.Go, rent a cottage at beach, a cabin in the mountains! Do whatever it takes to get back your muse."
5,Too short but very good,"This little addition was about a couple of days that she spends out of town with Micah, filling in for Larry on an Animator, Inc. job. Micah goes with her for ardeur purposes and for the FBI's benefit, pretends to be her assistant. Since she's never taken a Lycanthrop onto the cemetery before, things go a little differently this time. It's very good and we also get to see a little bit of Nathaniel, which makes me happy. (He's my favorite Anita guy) Also, at the end you get about 10 pages or so of the next book, Danse Macabre, coming out in June."
5,A great snack....,This book is a great snack to tide us over until the next installment. We finally get to hear Micah's story and get a terrific new possible surprise and plot development. My only complaint is that it went too fast. Fantastic!
2,disappointing,"short but not sweet. Her longer novels are better. the story wasn't developed, it could have been summed up in a paragraph as background info for another story."
1,This is the most redundant novel I've ever read,"This book pushed me to my breaking point. There's only so much of Anita's tight wet [...] I can take in one of Laurell's novels... having to read about it REPEATEDLY over the course of about nine paragraphs was just too much. Someone should teach Laurell that adding 'so' and 'very' in front of the same words does not help the story at all, as much as it makes it completely redundant. [...]I, actually, was very happy this story was so short. If it were any longer, I might have died in a fit of laughter. Several paragraphs had me tearing up. I'm not quite sure a ""serious"" novel is supposed to do that."
1,Dreadful,"Absolutely unrelentingly awful.I was a fan of the early Anita Blake novels, and now I read them because I keep hoping that we'll stop it with the random, out-of-nowhere sexcapades and get back into the interesting world that Ms. Hamilton created.Alas, this book did not do anything other than provide me with the precise position of Ms. Blake's cervix in proportion to the length of Micah's ""member,"" and remind us that Ms. Blake is a female ejaculator. And that her mystical link to Richard and the vampire permit her to heal from extremely rough sex very quickly.Why do I keep reading Ms. Hamilton's books? Maybe because I hope that eventually she'll leave the sexathons behind and return to the interesting plots.Unfortunately, as I mentioned previously, this is not the book for that."
1,"AWFUL ""book""","This was a waste of money, and time. The book was the equal of maybe an 8th of any other anita blake book. There was pretty much NO plot. You heard about Micah's past, and had a quicky violent scene. The ending was the typical hospital scene. It was horrible. I cannot believe the publisher had the balls to charge 8 dollars for this!"
4,Enjoyable,"I really liked this book. I think Micah is a great charater and I was glad to learn more about him. He is a very good companion for Anita, he helps her a lot in her work and social life. This was a very good filler book while we all anxiously await the next Adventure!"
1,Will the real Anita Blake please stand up?,"What is happening to this series? I love the Anita Blake books so much it hurts me to write this.Micah is a nice guy, with a hot body, but that is where the description ends. Even in this book the new things the reader learns about him just aren't that interesting. I would trade all the sex in the last two books for some good solid plot. I'm not saying take the sex out entirely, but at least give us a break between guys. If I'm reading five or six sex scenes a book, they're not erotic anymore, they are just plain annoying. Even the one sex scene in this book is weird. The only part that I liked about this book was the fact that Anita is getting back into her zombie raising.Buy the book if you are a die hard fan, and hope that Laurell gets the series back on track. Otherwise, it isn't worth it."
2,I am with Avid Reader,I am completly in agreement with Avid Reader. I think that they were trying to extend her latest novel into two books and did a poor job. It did not advance the plot (such as it has been lately) and I sincerely hope that Danse Macbre is better.....
2,disappointing,"After reading the reviews here, I decided to get this from the library, and am I ever glad I did. The story itself is decent, but it really does nothing to further our understanding of any of the characters. When I finished the book, it was like ""this is it?"" WTF. Yes, it is double spaced, and there's at least 2 blank pages inbetween chapters. I read the entire book waiting for a haircut at Supercuts, thats how short it is. Two stars because the story itself is sort of ok, although I was expecting more background on Micah, and it just wasnt there. There really was absolutly no point to this book, and its way, way too short to be full priced. It might have worked as an eBook that could have been printed at the back of Danse Macabre."
1,Woulda been good as a long short story,"A quick glance at the printed book will reveal the principal flaw: it is somewhat short on content. The text is double (or more) spaced with REALLY generous margins. So, when the typesetting is done efficiently, MICAH is about 60 pages or so of normal text.Hamillton also makes use of a ""while you were in a coma"" construct to resolve a major conflict.For shame, Laurell!"
2,You call this a novel??,"I love this series and own each book in it, so naturally I purchased the book with high hopes. I was *very* disappointed at the brevity of the story, how incomplete it was, and the overwhelming sense of the author rushing to get out a story by her deadline and to plug her next hardback novel. Shame on you Ms. Hamilton for cheating your fans!"
1,Embarassing,"I am a huge LKH fan but...this novella is insultingly bad. The publisher has obviously padded it out with widely spaced text, blank pages, and huge chapter headings in an attempt justify charging full book price for it. It is MUCH too short. There is even less plot than in the last few books, the character of Micah is peripheral to the plot and poorly developed. If LKH wasn't already well known, this would never have been published."
2,Why bother?,"This book is a teaser. I can forgive the author for writing a ""novel"" the size of a short story because most of her real novels are the size of three ordinary novels. I can't complain, therefore, that she doesn't give me my money's worth. The book tells us nothing new about Anita but does fill in some of Micah's background. The plot otherwise is thin. Anita is taking Larry's place at a zombie raising because his wife has some unexpected difficulties with her pregnancy. This main plot thread is speedily resolved, and the resolution has little to do with Micah, who the book is supposedly about. For those fans who just can't wait until Danse Macabre comes out, it's an appetizer before the main course, but I'm still not sure why she bothered."
2,Bulked Up Novella ... & Not A Good One,"Ms. Hamilton has always been a spotty writer. Some of her stuff is brilliant, some of it tepid. The serious issue with MICAH is that it isn't a novel.The actual page layout and filler content makes it painfully obvious Hamilton had to stretch this very incomplete and hollow story-- which removes Anita Blake with one of her lovers to Philadelphia in order to narrow the focus-- falls flat.Characters are introduced without further exploration, and the experimental feel of the piece makes gaping holes more noticable. We don't really feel any significant exploration of the relationship between Blake and Micah, nor do we ever really get any worthwhile plot regarding the brief ""murder"" trial it centers upon.The book feels like Hamilton did a character sketch, stretched it to a short story, and either conned her publisher (or was conned by them) to make a novel out of it.More Merry Gentry, please. Anita needs to retire... she is so clearly TIRED."
1,"Die, Micah! DIE!!!!","Can't she kill this guy off? I get the feeling that most fans agree with this sentiment. When is LKH going to listen? How long will she be able to ride on the success of her previous works?Micah as a character is a non-entity - why write a book (I use that term loosely) about such a blah character?The book is short, double-spaced, pointless, stupid, bad porn, has no plot and is alltogther revolting. What has happened to Laurell K. Hamilton? My personal observation is that her books have gone downhill since her second marriage. She needs to find a new muse. I will give her one last shot with Danse Macabre. If it's not up to snuff, it's the end of the line for me. If you want to read authors who haven't made a mockery of the genre, may I suggest: Charlaine Harris, Kelley Armstrong and Kim Harris."
2,Too short and stagnent,I agree with other reviewers. The book is too short and nothing happens. It only took me an hour or so to read. The price was not worth it. The book was nearly double spaced to flesh it out into a book length. I used to love Anita Blake. I now look forward to her books but it feels more like an obligation. The pre-view for the next full length book was a least interesting.
3,lost off the beaten track!,"I agree with most here it seems.Hamilton is losing here way in her writing.The 1st 9 or so books where heaps cool. Even as the sex scenes started to become more frequent I didnt mind too much. It made sense with in the story and it was easily visable that the author was evolving her style of writing.But these last few books just seem to be nothing striking about them. I can easily recall good scenes from the other books but this one only holds up under the zombie raising scene alone, just.Yes it was nice to finally get some more back story on Micah, but please it took me like 4 hours to read this one.not enough happening.When was the last time we had a good Edward story, he tends to make Anita take stock of herself and be the anita we came to like over the first 5 books."
1,Description too generic!,First I wish I had read the reviews for this product before I purchased as I would not have made the purchase. Secondly the description of the mats contains so little information that you think you are getting a great deal with the number of mats and the different sizes. They failed to say the mats come in sheets and you punch them out - the only one that can be used for 5 X 7 is an oval mat - then you move on to huge rectangle size mats - I cannot even use them for the project I am working on - was a waste of my money and I agree - why return and pay additional $$$
3,"2 good, 2 bad but consistently good Native Canadian & Native American acting","Spirit Bear was great. Very interesting set in Vancouver based on a true story of a teen green activist. Hiawatha was interesting with good acting as usual from some wonderful First Nation - Native Canadian and Native American actors with seasoned chops trying to do well with a minimal script. Both the Dan Haggerty films Sign of the Otter and Spirit of the Eagle were mediocre and inauthentic. Although they had good Native American actors - all characters were stereotypes with no real depth or authenticity, especially the minimal acting by the non-Native actors. I would suggest just buying Spirit Bear on it's own, as well as Song of Hiawatha unless you on are a low budget then it may be cheaper to buy the set."
2,Keep Your Checkbook Open,"If you buy this book, plan on keeping your checkbook open. You'll need it to buy the other books that Carla Cross frequently references and which are, unfortunately, key to using some of the charts contained in this book. Without the information from the other books it makes some of the charts useless. In the first 20 pages alone there are a dozen references to other books, either written by the author or others."
1,Poor content and limited direction,"This book provides limited direction. The plans and checklists are simplistic and the methods typically request the new agent to - ""Go ask three high production agents in your office"" for best practices. The author's writing style is poor (streams of thought do not flow) and she embeds a significant amount of text that points the reader to her other books/aids in the Reference section for more (and supposedly better information)."
5,SWITCHING FUNNY,"ALL I CAN SAY IS TURNER, REYNOLDS AND REEVE ARE HILARIOUS IN THIS MOVIE AND SHOULD NOT BE MISSED, THIS MOVIE IS A HIDDEN GEM ABOUT WHAT GOES ON IN THE NEWS..... LITERALLY EVERYTHING AND THEN SOME. TURNER PLAYS KRISTIE COLERAN EX WIFE TO REYNOLDS WHO IS CONCERNED THAT SHE IS MAKING A MISTAKE BY LEAVI NG THE NEWS TO MARRY REEVE AND STAR ON AN AM MORNING TALK SHOW,, NEEDLESS TO SAY WATCH THIS MOVIE IT IS FUNNY , HILARIOUS AND WILL HAVE YOU LOL @ PARTS... ALSO STARS NED BEATTY AS A MAN WHO IS RUNNING FOR GOVENOR. I GIVE SWITCHING CHANNELS 5 STARS FOR PERFORMANCE AND EXCELLENCE."
3,fast shipping product not the best quality,Many of the sticks were misshapen or cracked. We are using them for programs for my daughters wedding and only needed 300 so out of the 500 I was able to find enough good ones. The shipping was fast but a bit disappointed in the product.
3,A Nostalgic look at speaker building,"I purchased this book back in 1978 from Radio Shack when I was 11 years old. If you want' a neat look back at what was typical speakers of the late 60's to early 70's you will enjoy reading this. I built a Bass Reflex project (with help from my Grampa) Based on a 8"" Full Range with whizzer cone. The speakers cost all of 5.00$ each back then. I still have that copy of this book stains and all. Their is no math for parameters or crossovers, there is a graph or two for speaker volumes. There are also some open back designs. As far as designing anything today it's useless, but for a look back it's pretty neat."
5,Draw closer to the Father's heart,"This is simply one of the best Cd's I have ever heard as far as Christian praise, adoration, confession and thanksgiving through music goes. Buy it and you won't be disappointed. Earphones are a must."
4,love it!,we bought this as our daughter's 1st high chair when she was about 5 months old. I really like it she's comfy in it. the belt is easy to put on but we don't use it the tray has a piece of plastic that comes in beetween the legs so baby can't slip out. the try comes off so easy just one handed and cleans up really easy too. the cusion is plastic and it washes off nicely too! the little clear tray on top of the regular tray is dishwasher safe and it's nice for when juice get's spilled on it it just pops right off. the seat itself has a few differnt positions. we have only needed the upright one as she's sat up on her own fora while. sits so she is almost eye level with me. and it attaches to our chairs very securly and it was easy to do it. only thing I don't like about his is it doesn't fit under our table so it's not really a space saver like I thought it would be. but we have a decorative piece around the edge of our table makes it not fit by about 2 in. otherwise we love it!!
4,"Nothing new, but the old is damn good","I don't have too much to say about this book, except that it is deffinately worth reading. I've seen most of the concepts preseted in this book (chemically altered super genius, shapeshifting aliens, human/alien marriages, etc.) but everything a new twist, a special touch that makes this a fun and interesting read. It only took me a day to read, so one doesn't have to commit much time or effort to this book. For that reason, I'd recommend this book to anyone, not just fans of Bester or sci-fi in general."
1,A Biuble to my Competitors,"A few reviewers have done a good job pinpointing serious weaknesses in this book. I agree and hope that my competition reads and adheres to advice in this book to a ""T"". Then I'll buy the author a bottle of champagne in gratitude."
1,Shameless Self Promotion,"After reading the Amazon reviews of this book I enthustiastically ordered it only to now believe that the reviews have been ""peppered"" by well wishers. The author has undoubtedly read the consultants handbook that recommends writing a book to extol the benefits of your practice and the author has done just that. The topic of competitive advantage takes a back seat to tales of glory of how the author has succeeded on the lecture circuit, with seminars and serving a broad range of clients. The stoties told are directed at agrandising the author rather than making relevant points about competitive advantage. This is a book for neophites to the competitive advantage arena who would be better advised to look elsewhere for a book on topic rather than one intended as shameless self promotion for the author. I will offer my used copy for resale as almost new since it unfortunately didn't get underlined as I normally do."
4,Its huge!!!,"Wonderful display of colors, love it for gaming or just browsing. If I had the need, or someone who needed it, I would buy another one!"
2,The real (NOT) Spanish,"You would enjoy this book IF and only IF your Spanish is from Mexico. For anyone else, you'll be disappointed!"
1,Expensive,This is a table for $330. You can buy a decent dining table for that price. Why would anyone spend $330 on a grooming table? This doesn't even have a leash holder.Go buy a table from Ikea for $80. You can save the remainder of that money to buy 250 Greenies.
1,Worst conditioning experience ever!,"My normal conditioner changed their formula, so I was on the hunt for another. I chose this and the antipoof, because I have both conditions. I have never had a worse conditioning experience than I did today. I have super thick, super curly hair and this didn't even touch it. In fact, it made it worse. I couldn't finger through my hair in the shower like I normally do. It made my hair more tangled than before I added it and turned it into a huge knotted mess! The more I added, the worse it got. I just had to give up, rinse it out and pull out some leave in and went at it with a pick!!! It was horrible!!."
3,Works well except it has a small leak and not sealed well by the pump,The dump hose is too short but that was not a problem i bought some heater hose from local autoparts store and got the length i needed. The pump worked well and the item worked as advertised. The reason i gave it 3 stars is because the top vent cap is cheap and could potentially break off but the biggest reason i gave it 3 stars is because while it was pumping out the 4 gallons of gas there was a small leak by the pump. Nothing i could do since the piece is fit at factory and does not come apart so i can seal it better. I just wrapped a rag around it and job done. For the price you can't complain
4,Readers Digest article,"This is either the article from the 1956 Readers Digest, or a more complete update of that article, which was actually a fairly short essay. Lester Velie wrote quite a bit about crooked activities and corrupt unions, but was amazed when he encountered IBEW Local 3's Hary Van Arsdale, Jr. and wrote this short article about the activities of HVA and Local 3.It is historically accurate, and describes how labor and managhement both profited from good labor relations."
2,I wish I had known...,"This bag is big, I mean really big. But that's ok, so am I at 6'1"" and 250 pounds. It should be big enough for a seven foot tall 500 pound linebacker or two average people and their dog. I'll have plenty of stretch room. I have three issues with this sleeping bag. First, the cotton liner is attached only at the zipper and the foot. While using it, this liner is loose and moves independently from the rest of the bag, resulting in me becoming twisted up in the liner when I turned. I had to get it sewn to the rest of the bag. I'll see if this reduces the warmth. Second, the hood would fit someone with a head about two feet across. Third, the stuff sack that it came with is way too small and I had a wrestling match getting it back in. I bought a much larger compression bag to be able to pack it. Would I buy this again? No. Maybe the dog will like it."
4,misled,"it's actually a very nice, warm, and large sleeping bag. the problem is that i was searching for an old fashioned flannel sleeping bag. this is made to look like flannel, but it's synthetic. had to return it."
1,Good bag but poor quality zipper,We bought this bag a gift for one of our children. It has been used 2X but the zipper pull has come off. I would not buy it again.
4,Great fun book!,"My daughter received this as a gift, and LOVES it! I chose to buy this book for a friend's daughter. Great story, love the art!"
5,The Best Slack Key Collection?,"It could be. I have a pretty extensive collection of slack key CDs, and this is my favorite. Without it, I may have never heard Ozzie Kotani or Moses Kahumoku. It's beautifully recorded, the liner notes are well written, plus they give all the tunings."
5,love this stone.,"This is a great stone, arrived perfectly in one piece, this same stone is rated number #1 by Cooks illustrated Test kitchen. It's a great price, and well worth the money. If you want to make some great Pizza, pair this with the Superpeel, a night and day difference between using a pan and stone. I get the oven hot, 500 degrees, no cracking problems. I preheat the oven to 500 for almost an hour to get the stone nice and hot, pizza cooks in about six minutes, finish it off under the brolier for a nice brown crust and perfectly melted cheese. yum."
5,Thicker and big enough for 3 or 4 naan,"Good stone - This is a half inch thick throughout with some even thicker ""feet"" in its mold also. I'm happy with the size, thickness and results. It arrived in one piece even though the temps outside were below zero fahrenheit - I was a bit worried it would have cracked due to some other reviews. I let it sit in the box overnight, at least a good eight hours, maybe twelve, so it could warm up and then I used it. I can get 3 or 4 naan or pita on it at one time and 2 personal size pizzas. Make sure you preheat your oven to 500 degrees F to get a crisp crust on pizza."
1,Not pizza stone I ordered.,"I thought I was ordering the Old Stone Oven model 4467 which is supposed to have the heat core. That is not what I got. I got a plain generic pizza stone. Not in Old Stone Oven packaging and no logo imprint on the pizza stone. Did not want an imitation pizza stone, I could get one for a lot cheaper. I want the genuine Old Stone Oven Pizza stone. Buyer beware, they are not shipping out the real thing."
5,This thing is great,"I use two of these in gas oven at temperatures reaching upwards of 700 degrees and they have performed admirably for over five months.I whole heartedly recommend these.Update: going on three years use now. Great product, great for pizza's. I use parchment paper to get the pizza's right on them.Going on six years and somehow these things have withstood the test of time..."
1,Disappointed--unrealistic requirements,"Disappointed! I did everything I could to follow the instructions (don't let oil get onto the stone) that I now see are unrealistic. Try making pizza after pizza without a few ""oops"" of something oily. The stone should be able to forgive a few ""mistakes"" but it smoked & stunk the house, and there are no remedies I can find.I concluded that this stone would be most suited to outdoor baking--something I even considered after this experience.After reverting to my cookie sheet, which was a letdown of course, I found a glazed ceramic baking/pizza stone that allows washing. Problem solved, and I'm now able to bake good crusty pizza and pita bread again."
1,Same old story...,"So I decided to ignore the ""broken stone"" posts thinking that SURELY by now Amazon would have addressed the poor packing issue. I sent one to a relative as a Christmas gift...of course it arrived broken. As they live 600 miles away I graciously asked them to return it. They returned it to Amazon and received a second stone...again it was broken. We are waiting on a refund. I have enjoyed using a pizza stone for years and was very excited that my relative was going to share the experience. We were both really bummed."
3,Deep scratch on the stone,"I just got it and it has a good size scratch on the top. It goes into the surface and about 1 1/2"" long. Is this going to effect the performance and life of the stone? I really don't want to pay shipping to return it."
5,Couldn't be happier-,Arrived in great shape. Already made 2-3 pizzas and it performed as advertised. It takes up the entire upper oven on our Kitchenaid dual oven stove and will stay right where it is.
1,Arrived Broken - Poor Packaging.,"My stone arrived in 3 pieces. The manufacturer's packaging was poor; no dunnage top or bottom, the stone was only supported at its edges by a cardboard ring with cutouts to hold the stone. The Amazon box outside the manufacturer's box was OK but was not marked ""FRAGILE"" as it should have been. I'm not at all surprized it broke in transit."
1,they break after 5-10 times of use,"I tried different pizza stones, different brand, prices,sizes....all of them eventually break down after few times you use them. I followed the instructions on how to take care...no soap no rapid thermal exposures etc etc...."
1,"The kid's 5...and she says she's ""in love""!","Junie B. Jones: Kindergartener. She's worrying about having a boyfriend and living ""happily ever after"" in her strange Junie-like world. First of all, her grammar is horrible and is fighting over this poor little 5-year-old boy named Warren, who just wants to be left alone. Even Lucille and Grace liked him, and Junie B liked him because he was on a T.V. commercial. I'm 9 now, and I think Junie B has lost her mind of wanting a boyfriend. Then, she begs her mom to go to the mall so she can buy princess clothes to make Warren notice him. She made comments like: ""And he was beauty to our eyes..."" ""What a chunk."" and ""...I think I'd like him as my new boyfriend."" She said she needed to ""move on in her life"", which I thought was silly. OK, so she learned you shouldn't make friends by buying fancy stuff to make him or her like you, but Junie B needs to quit thinking about boys and more about her English!"
3,I'm not as crazy about this book.....,"I'm not so certain that this book is as good as people here are saying it is. I read it based on the fact that people who read Julian Jaynes' masterpiece ('The Beginnings of Conscience in the Breakdown of the Bicameral Mind') have a tendency to buy it. It is a good book, and very thought provoking in sections. But, as a whole, it alternates between relatively unsophisticated philosophy and kinda popularizes a bunch of stuff that has been out there. Perhaps it's a bit too New-Agey for my tastes.... but I can't reccommend reading it..... Unless you have already read it (like me) read the Jaynes book mentioned above...(Please don't hate me for writing this!!!!)"
5,Tickled pink:),"Color affects everything, ""Color The Secret Influence"" examines the science, psychology, and history of color. The information and studies discussed within touch on many facets of everyday life. The book begins by defining color, and discusses it in the context of it's affects on health, psychology, architecture, landscape design, sales, marketing, packaging, fashion, and culture in general.If you have the slightest interest in learning about color for commercial purposes, designing and decorating your home, improving or understanding your color preferences, or how your everyday color choices and preferences affect you, buy this book!. It's is phenomenal, absolutely the best all encompassing book on color I've ever come across. While the information contained within, can be applied to web and graphic design, the depth of this book goes FAR beyond anything else I have read! It covers MUCH more than just creating attractive color combinations."
1,Who is Nabokov??? No answers.... and-the-room-was-so-silent-I-heard-a Cough.,"O.K., once again this Russian runaway is subjecting his very own petty preferences on a piece and scope of Western Literature that (HE...Vladimir the Great) is not a part of. Sorry Nabby, but your prose style is too flabby and your envious lil' lectures are a lot too gabby. So who is Nabokov? Well he is a guy who'sbook o' pedophilia was only put on the map because a director named Kubrick decided to thumb it's pages. You don't like Hemingway,Camus,Faulkner or Cervantes....alright Nabby, you don't have to like them, your dead and barely living through Lolita. These great authors and their great opuses are still greatly alive with them. Sorry Nabby, maybe in your next lifetime you will be apart of the club."
4,Honourable soldier,"Excellent compilation of letters from young Christian man in the British army, through the shocking course of World War I experiences in France. It illustrates courage and perseverance of the highest calibre."
2,Spidey Betrayed -- by Indifferent Proofreaders,"This interesting black-and-white blast from Marvel's Silver Age past is thankfully uncolored, either by Ted Turner or anyone else -- but the appalling number of typos make the book irritating to read. Can't Marvel afford proofreaders, or is all their money going to publicize the Spider-Man movies? The contents page lists the reprint as ""relettered,"" leading me to wonder if the typos were faithfully copied from the original or were added in the relettering, or a mixture of both. Pages 32 and 33 alone contain 6 typos, leading to such enlightening exchanges as ""It's Mr. Jameson. He has any appointment."" ""My story will make you for a shoo-in for office."" ""Yes, yes. Or course."" My own favorite is Captain Stacy's comment, ""May heaven protect us from those they know all they need to know...about anything."" Heaven protect us, indeed."
3,Good for someone just starting,"This is a good 101 basic text. I don't think it's the best choice for someone who has been in and out of facilities and rehabs because this will just be a repeat of everything you've already heard. So it really depends on where you are in your recovery and what type of recovery you need (AA as opposed to REBT, etc...). I would assume it's also a great resource for someone going into substance abuse counseling."
3,"""The More You Put Into These Books The More You Get Out""","After my 27 years in the business, if I had a crutch like this I would have been on the fast track long ago. Anyone who helps themselves to this outline for a new life I hope they stick with it until they can see the style this crutch was organized and written."
1,A little diversity please!,"I got through about 6 of these essays when I decided to flip through the book and read the biography of the authors since it was all starting to sound the same. All of these women are writers!! How is this a good sampling of real women? These are women with careers that can be translated into part time work through free lance. And it is difficult to feel the struggle of the women that have full time babysitters when they are ""stay at home"" moms. I am a working mom in a technical field where it very difficult to take off years and then go back to the work force or do anything part time. It would have been nice to hear the voices of people in similar situations."
1,Agree with JP.,"For her review of this book in the May 2006 ""Atlantic Monthly,"" Sandra Tsing Loh coins the word ""afflufemza"" to describe the delusion that the trials and tribulations of rich, white yuppie mommies with nannies and other household servants are those of feminism itself.Unsurprisingly, in her Washington Post column the other day, Steiner wrote that she thinks she and other ""moms"" ought to be paid more, get more benefits, etc., etc. Entitlement, thy name is Yuppie Breeder.She reminds me of Michelle Gaboury, the rich soccer mom in Elinor Burkett's excellent _The Baby Boon: How ""Family-Friendly America Cheats the Childless_, who sat in her huge, skylighted, granite-topped-counter kitchen with Burkett and had the nerve to describe herself as ""in need"" because she'd reproduced."
1,Waste of time and anger provoking,"The author clearly has her own opinion about the so called ""Mommy wars"" and chose essays to support her view. Yes, some essays were beautiful but I found the book demeaning towards women who choose to be stay at home moms. Example: p. 21 ""Every few years a politician might commandeer a cute soccer mom for a photo op, but rarely are stay-at-home moms asked to open their mouths or pick up their pens to tout their opinions. It was important that stay-at-home moms have a voice in this book, but I worried about how to find them. How do you contact women who've never published anything?"" Her attitude of stay-at-home moms conveyed in this book is that we are uneducated idiots. Big thumbs down from my stay-at-home mother's group (which consists of two former child psychologists, two former designers and a writer."
3,"Good, but does not apply to most people.","The book's title is a poor description -- it should have been ""Mommy Wars : Stay-at-Home and Career Media Executives...""While the essays to provide insight for those seeking to understand the balance a mother has to seek when parenting ""interrupts"" a career, it does not help the ""average"" American who does not wear ""Anthropologie"" outfits and can afford a nanny *and* part time work.While I can appreciate the writing ability of the women selected to contribute to this anthology, I would have liked to read the opinions of women who did not work in media or education. Where's the face-off for the government employee who doesn't have on-site day care? Where's the challenge for the mom who's self-employed and works 60 hours each week to pay for her home? Where's the single mother who works at Wal-Mart?The so-called challenges described by Steiner & Co. do not apply to 80%+ of US households. Good writing, little relevancy."
5,I know I have a soul because The Rev's voice touches it.,"Skillful guitar plus a pure voice! This CD is my cure for road rage--puts me in that ""hang loose"" kind of attitude. Liner notes have stories about each song plus which key he plays it in, but no translations."
3,Good coverage but lacks depth and contains inaccuracies.,This book covers the important areas of the exam and is certainly worth purchasing as a study aid - however rely more on plenty of hands on experience to pass. The tests within the book and on the CD-Rom were OK but don't expect them to strongly resemble the actual exam. They also contain a number of errors.
1,Do not buy!,"I bought this to blow up my daughter's Jump-o-lene. What a disaster! She was so happy when we opened the Jump-O-lene box and laid it out, only to be disappointed when the Coleman air pump would not even turn on! Now we have to wait until another electric air pump can arrive! Not what you expect from Coleman nor Amazon!"
5,"Works great, a bit noisy","We have a Coleman air mattress (the 4-in-1 air bed) that we only use in our home (as opposed to camping). Consequently, getting an electric pump seemed like an obvious choice. The coleman 120V Quick pump works great and is designed to work with Coleman products. You blow up the bed, then when it's fully inflated, push in to lock and then manually seal the bed. It works perfectly and easily as described and is a great purchase. The only caveat is that it is a bit noisy, so if you have close neighbors or sleeping kids, aim to blow up the bed earlier rather than later in the evening."
5,the pump is great,"I bought a Coleman 4 in 1 mattress, and wondered whether I needed the pump - after all, it cost almost as much as the mattresses (but was not expensive - right at $20.) Asked my daughter, and she said ""yes! you'll melt part of the mattress if you try using a blowdryer, and it's just worth it"". She was right - it didn't cost much, but I was concerned about storage space.It is not very large, so storing it is not a big issue. It quickly inflated my mattresses (I think it was under 2 minutes - but didn't actually use a timer), and is great for deflating, also.So if you're wondering if you really need it, I'd say yes."
1,LOUD!,This pump works well enough but it is so loud that I need to wear my lawnmower earplugs when filling up the pool.
4,Great buy for the price,"I bought this to inflate my exercise ball - much better option than using the hand pump that comes with the ball. This can also be used to inflate my lawnmower / snowblower tyres, the kid's bikes and so on. Great buy so far."
5,Coleman 120v Electric Quick Pump for Inflatables,"I bought this pump along with a coleman inflatable mattress for overnight guests. I am old school and had always used a foot pump etc for blowing up the inflatable toys and such and boy am I impressed. Within 10 seconds it inflated the mattresses, then I used it on an inflatable pool. Very satisfied with my product"
1,LOUD and SLOW,This product is an insult - first of all it is loud enough to wake your neighbors and second it is incredibly slow! Takes about 10 minutes to inflate a Full size airmattress at which time point the device is very hot and gives of a suspicious smell. Apparently there is absolutely no QC in China and Coleman does not care either. This product does not deserve even 1/2 a star. An insult to the customer!
2,won't work for a bicycle,I read the review beore the purchase. I planned to use the unit for pumping up the bicycle. But turned out the adaptor doesn't fit for a bicycle. So it has been sitting in my garage since.
4,noisy but efficient,"I found this pump inflated the Coleman beds I bought so speedily that I could put up with the leaf-blower-loud sound. I had originally bought it to inflate another brand of inflatable chair, with a smaller inflation port, that took so long I bought a large capacity hand pump instead. But for Coleman products, the Quick Pump is perfect."
2,Slow and LOUD,This pump is SLOW and LOUD as heck. I had to give it two stars because it works... albeit with the problems I just mentioned.
5,Worked great,I have only used this product for one trip so far - but for two different air mattresses - blown up several times a day (another story!) and it worked great each time!
4,Product performs well,"The pump is ok, perform according to expectations. Only one down side is that it is way too noisy. Guess thats an issue with all air handlers but this one is realy noisy. Power cord is also rather ver short, have to inflate the mattress from a closer, very closer distance to the wall, thats an inconvenience."
5,does the job and is compact.,Simple and easy to use. It inflated the coleman twin bed in 30 seconds.Everything that I expected from this item.
1,Just say no.,"This is not a healthy product for chinchillas. A chinchilla who is fed this will invariably dig out the sweet stuff and leave all the healthy pellets at the bottom of his cage. This diet will result in a chin with a shortened life span and bad digging habits. Chinchillas need lots of dry timothy hay, a plain, high fiber alfalfa pellet, and 1/2 teaspoon a day of oats or oatmeal for a treat. Be a good chinchilla owner, feed something healthy for it, not something that looks yummy for you."
4,Happy Chinchillas,"Crittie Pie and Maya loved their food and their sand bath. They are very happy Chins. I liked the quick delivery but when I realized that the vendor that I purchased this product from was one mile from my workplace and I paid $8.47 shipping, I wonder now if they have a ""will call"" counter for customer pick up. I am a little dissapointed about that..otherwise I liked buying my chinchilla food and sand bath online."
4,Info,"Just as scientists observe and catalog the material world, Buddhists for centuries have been observing and cataloging the components of the human psyche. Addressing both the nature of the human mind and how humans know what they know, Buddhist psychology offers a rich and subtle knowledge of the inner experience. Here, Buddhism's unique, time-tested way of viewing the mind is explained so that followers of Tibetan Buddhism can understand their anger and aversion, and develop equanimity, patience, and love."
3,Some Inaccuracies,"I was excited to find this book, as my grandfather came to America as a young boy from Italy around the same time that this story takes place. While there are many features of the story that accurately reflect the Italian immigrant culture of that era, there were some comments that were more reflective of present day ideologies. Religion is important in the Italian culture. While its prominance was indicated in the story, there were some comments that were uncharacteristic of their faith. I was disappointed when the doctor, a prominent character, tells the young girl ""I believe in all gods...I see God in that tortellini."" It was also disturbing to read Sophia suggesting that ""hard hoping"" was better than praying in difficult situations. Strong faith sustained and encouraged so many Italian immigrants and I felt the story portrays a distortion of their religious beliefs."
4,love this album,"I own some of the Hawaiian Master slack key guitars albums so I checked this one out. I love it, really nice change from traditional Christmas music. Loved having it in the background for party!I recommend it highly!"
1,Possibly the most poorly made item I've purchased from Amazon!,"Very cheaply made. The battery doesn't seat properly. I had to wrestle with it for a bit before I got it to seat properly - even so if the item is handled, the battery disconnects sometimes. The hygrometer is neither reliable nor valid. The temperature display never worked (defective out of the box). Possibly the worst item I've ever purchased from Amazon and its going back!"
1,lasted one day past return period,"This unit worked fine but stopped working one day past the return period. I do not recommend. Also, it uses difficult to obtain watch batteries."
2,Zikes,"Should have paid more attention in math class. I will bow to others who have written positive reviews, but I just got confused. Like many good computer books though, I will give it another try when my brain frees up some memory."
1,Poor Fit - Bad Design,"I purchased 2 of these cases for myself and a friend. When they arrived, I opened one and tried to place the headset inside it. It does not fit well at all and you must fold it up to get it in at all. This means unfolding it again each time you want to use it - not a big deal but a time waster. In addition, the fit is so tight that it will only take a very short amount of time before the foam cover over the ear insert will abrade away. Very poor design. It appears to be a case that is not designed for this phone but just has a sticker put over the generic name to say that it's for the 510. Additionally, it's not really a case - it's just a holster. I returned both cases and would suggest anyone else not buy them."
2,Carrying case,"This item is a little pricy for it's value, I think.Hard to get the Bluetooth to stay in case."
2,"Carrying Case, WHAT carrying case?","Though the Platntronics Voyager 510 works quite well, I was terribly disappointed with the accompanying carrying case which cost me an addtional $25! It's simply too small for the headset!"
1,Very Poor Design,"As many have mentioned, the headset tends to pop out or slip out, unless you manage to have it poke out the bottom of the holster, which makes it mostly lock in place at the top. This is very bad design, at all times one part of the headset is exposed for damage. I don't see how I can give this more than 1 star, I would actually prefer to give it zero.If something is supposed to protect your investment, and at all times one part is unprotected, and you have to improvise on how to use it, or it might fall out of the holster, then what good is it?"
3,is ok,"This case is ok, is kind of thigh for the headset, it could be a little bigger and the depending on how you place the headset the microphone or the ear attach part are unprotected because the case doesn't cover the whole headset."
5,"This is the ""Dummy's Guide to Repair Evos""","Most of the people I ride with have ""Shovelheads"", and don't know about the Evo's. This book gives you step by step instructions for many everyday maintenance procedures. I don't ""turn a wrench"" for a living, but with this book I can do most of the work on my Road King at home, and not have to pay $75.00 an hour labor costs!!! Thanks Mr. Woodring for finally giving us back yard mechanics a well illustrated, and simple instruction manuel."
2,"A Great Premise, A Sour Disappointment","John March is a hardboiled P.I. and former cop, and a skeptic about life and love. His brother David, with whom John has little to like and no positive childhood memories of, comes to him for help. David is being blackmailed by a woman he met via the computer and had sexual encounters with. When she's murdered, David and then his wife come to John for help.A really good premise, really one of the best I've heard in a long time, so I was very much disappointed when this story didn't work for me. John March was interesting at first but the story became dour and a downer. So much more could have been done with this story, with the family relationships, with the wife's involvement, with the interaction between John and David, with John's outlook, but the story lacked all these things. Too bad, this was a story I wanted to like."
2,Too little of too much,"I read all the positive reviews of this book and I read the first free chapters free on Amazon. I was intrigued. I bought the book and started reading with great hope of finding another great author. Unfortunately, the interest soon waned as more and more obtuse characters were introduced but not defined. You almost need a pad of paper to write down who is who and what their involvement in the case is. Everyone is a stereotype and shallow. I forced myself to finish the book, many questions are unanswered and I won't go out of my way to read anymore of the author's books. I was very disappointed. I've listed the book for sale on Amazon, I don't even want to give it to my literary friends to read and I usually either keep a novel or share it if I don't want to add it to my bookshelves. That says everything."
4,does what it needs to,"It's a 3.5"" USB floppy drive. I this because my mom needed it for work and her new desktop and laptop don't have these drives in them anymore (thank goodness for that). It can lay flat or on its side, but flat works better as it doesn't move around pushing the disk in or getting it out. The main reason I bought this particular drive is because it has a swappable blue or white glossy plastic top, and the grey base with glossy white top matched her dell desktop and laptop."
4,Living Religions w/CD (6th Edition),"I found Living Religions to be very interesting and informative. Before reading this book, I knew very litte about religions other than my own. After reading this text, I discovered the beauty in each religion presented and was able to erase the stereotypes and stigmas that I once held. I recommend this book to anyone who has little understanding of world religions and would like to become educated or for someone who may just need a reminder. It is an easy read, with the exception of some of the vocabulary associated with the different religions."
5,Recent purchase of Living Religions By; MaryPat Fisher,This book was in great condition and was sent to me fast and efficiently. Thank You
5,balls to the wall rock n roll!!!!,"it don't get much better than this,folks.WARNING:you may blow out your speakers and wear out your dancin' shoes!!!!the best rockabilly cd around,a must have!!!"
2,Computer Review,"The movie was below expectations. I thought it would provide more information that would be more interesting. As a teacher, I had thought this would be an interesting movie for students, but after watching it, I am not so sure. Maybe not as a teacher I may enjoy this movie."
1,Not that much of a Deal,"I got this item because a saw that it was an Amazon Gold deal. I though "" ohh what a good idea"" and it was not expensive.Well... to my surprise it was not a good deal. The tanning solution smells very good...cant complaint... BUT the machine it self doesnt work...I dont know if it was bad luck or what...but after been charged properly it sprays for like a minute or so and then it stops... I wouldnt recommed this product to anyone."
1,Did not even receive correct product!! VERY unhappy!!!,"I ordered the white ""Viatek IBOD Personal Airbrush Tanning System"" In details it said it was: I-Bod Rechargeable Tanning Unit with adapter I-Bod 8 oz bottle of Rapid DHA Tanning solution I-Bod 2oz bottle of tan extender I-Bod 2oz bottle of exfoliator... I received a gold Ibod tanning gun that required batteries.. was not rechargable and I ONLY receivedthe tanning solution. I did NOT receive 2oz bottle of tan extender OR 2oz bottle of exfoliator as described. VERY unhappy with order!!"
2,"More like ""Reading Made Stupid.""","There are some funny parts in this book, but the writer's sense of humor becomes very predictable (and therefore not funny) in a very short period of time: The sole trick is to use words that sound similar but have different meanings, which gets old rather quickly. If you don't believe me and want to buy my copy, contact me!"
4,Tyrant Rules St. Fredeswide,"Margaret Frazer continues the tyrantical rule of Domina Alys in THE PRIORESS' TALE. The peace of St. Frideswide has been destroyed by her relatives that have taken up residence in the guest halls and the workmen who are attempting to build a tower without stone.The list of sins laid at Domina Alys' door is long: spending money they do not have, feeding her relatives from the precious stores of scant food as they face a hard winter after a poor harvest, kidnapping a young girl to force her into marriage, and murder.Domina Alys was a poor accidental choice as the nunnary declines and no one can change her course.An open window to the medieval world where power in the wrong hands destroys the good. This one has some very cruel scenes that are only lightened for Dame Frevisse with the advent of an old friend.Nash Black, author of SANDPRINTS OF DEATH"
5,Ben Franklin's Web Site,"With more than 25 years of experience writing on privacy issues in his newsletter, Privacy Journal, Smith has written a clear, readable history of privacy in America that weaves the various threads of and threats to privacy together in a well-documented fashion. From Americans' insatiable curiosity to the tabloid press, from mistrust of the census to the endless collection of personal information we face today, Smith examines it all thoroughly and cogently. Certainly the best book on privacy I have read. Highly recommended both for those who know something about the area already and those who would like to know more."
1,Distortion of John E. Holts Public Record,"The information in this book about John E. Holt, former GSA Official is false."
1,Worked OK for a year and then died,"For 1 year the pump worked OK. It does not have much power so inflating tires takes a long time. Guage seemed to be OK.However, the pump is it died in 12 months and could not be fixed. I had a mechanic look at it and he said the electrical elements were toast. His opinion (and I agree with it after opening it up) is that the thing is cheaply made."
4,Good waterfall,I use this as a filter and to drop water in to an upper pond. The filters work good and seem to catch all sizes of material. It was easy to install and I have no complaints with the product.
1,Bad sound,"Too bad a one star rating is required. It deserves zero stars. I bought the set and had to return it. (NO CCs as advertised by Amazon.com) It is a shame such a otherwise good work could have been ruined by the terrible sound. Mushy mouth narration punctuated incessantly by drums, horns and many other useless noises too numerous and wierd to describe. At one point there was something a child described as a giant dragon burp. First behead the the narrator and get someone that can enunciate, (at the very least insist he finish his porridge before recording), include CCs and/or subtitiles(Amazon advertised CCs) and reissue the DVDs.I would REALLY like to HEAR and see them all."
3,4 years later: the HD failed,"This drive has been working very well for about 4 years, then yesterday I plug it in the computer and it doesn't work. I reformat it, then it works fine.Today, I plug it in, select files, drag and drop, it copies, then click click click, starts working again, stops, click click click... bad news for me. Good thing I used it to transfer files from my old iMac G4 to my Intel iMac, I haven't lost anything.The hard drive is a Seagate ATA-100. I've opened the case, and I'll put a new hard drive hoping the LaCie stuff was not the problem in the first place."
2,Dissapointing,"The projects in this book are dull and provide little interet to (my) kids.It also lacks drawing and illustrtations. However, it is well written"
3,Banded Collar Multi Colored Shirt,This shirt was a very beautiful shirt; good quality and cheaper than any shirt of this kind in any department store.
5,A Memorable Children's book,"This is one of the few great books I remember from childhood. Kids aged 7-10 will love the magical elements, and especially the idea of ""trading Mom in"", something every child has wanted to do at least once! It is a story with a moral, but the moral does not intrude on the fun."
2,exercise appropriate for tots,"don't know if it is for kids, I am short and I can't skip with it, not until i bought a longer rope and re-string it"
3,a little short for a skipping rope!,"Although its strong its a little short for a skipping rope and I would have preferred something longer. Even though it said it was 6 foot long, it kept getting stuck in my foot when I jumped continuously. I still use it and its lasting but I would have got a longer rope."
4,Cuts well.,Doesn't quite cut all the way from top to bottom on the tongue on 3/4 red oak. Adjusted and adjusted and never could. Had to end up just using a box blade to trim off the excess. Almost like the carbide wasn't tall enough. Works but not like I would have hoped.
1,Dump-rope,"In spite of the item description, this rope certainly isn't ""weighted"" -- quite the opposite. The beads are made of very thin, light plastic tubing segments with interior diameters much larger than the rope (so they don't remain centered, giving it a zig-zaggy, disjointed appearance). It's also impossible to achieve higher jumping speeds. Don't be fooled -- as is typical of so many things made in China, this rope is just a facsimile of the real thing."
2,JUNGLE JUSTICE,"The Twits (a British pop culture term from the 50's) are really a disgustingly nasty couple who deserve each other. When not playing gross and cruel practical jokes on each other--which escalate into unadulterated viciousness--they plot to catch our feathered friends for their weekly Bird Pie. Complete with tiny birdie feet sticking out from the crust like so many skimpy crosses. Ugh...Well, anyway, their caged monekys increasingly resent being tortured in their topsy-turvy world, so with the aid of an exotic bird from their native Africa, the simian family seeks freedom and jungle justice for these pitiful excuses for human beings. The silly tale reads quickly--enhanced by the ridiculously skuzzy illustrations by Quentin Blake, who packs 75 sketches into 76 pages. It's such a revolting burlesque that it's almost funny. Offering no social redemption or character development, THE TWITS is a light read down the road of literary lunacy--cute withall."
1,sad reflection on Dahl's life at the time?,"Who wants their child to read a book about a hateful couple who spend the entire duration of the book fighting back and forth? I, for one, do not. Knowing that Dahl divorced shortly after this book was written makes me wonder if this was possibly a reflection of his feelings at the time."
3,Choose another edition if you want color illustrations,"This is a great book, but you should be aware that the hardcover edition with the reddish-brown cover and a small picture of Mr. and Mrs. Twit below Dahl's name is a low-quality version of it. The original illustrations were in delightful color, and these are in black and white. Also, the paper is of low quality and tears easily -- think mass market paperback paper rather than picture-book paper."
5,Great book!,"I read this book as a child and puchased it to read to my 4 year old son. He loved the book. He did not want me to stop reading it. Roald Dahl is a great author. I recommend purchasing ""The BFG"", by the same author, which my son liked even more."
3,the nasty twits,"I liked the part where Mrs. Twit gets the shrinks. She goes crazy. Mr.Twit is exactly like his wife, instead of the shrinks, he gets wormed. Mrs. Twit plays a trick on him and put worms in his spaghetti. I would recommend this book because it is very crazy and funny."
5,Fun for any age,"This book is hilarious. I read it every time I need a good pick-me-up. I'm glad I got the kindle version, as my real life copy is falling apart."
4,A kids book that makes adults look stupid: RECOMMENDED,"The Twits are the most horrible, disgusting couple in the world, and they do horrible, disgusting things to each other. It's great! Super funny!The illustrations are great! The book wouldn't be nearly as funny without the closeup drawings of Mr. Twit's food encrusted beard.The moral of the story? Take a Bath! and Be nice to your pets."
4,Lenses for Kodak Easyshare,"I purchased this item for my sister after being unable to find the actual Kodak products. I had no problem completing the transaction and received the product quite quickly. Comparing these lenses to 35mm lenses I have purchased for myself in the past, they seem cheaply made to me, but she is happy with them and says they work quite well."
3,It Was Okay,"This book was okay. It sort of moved along at the same pace as the English country side, which is too slow for me."
1,Probably the worst computer software book ever written!!!,"I was in the bookstore looking for a book about Exchange. This book was the cheaper one so I bought it, but I was very disappointed with this book I should have bought the more expensive one. This book is only concerned with doing tasks in Exchange and does not explain the protocols used in Exchange. This book presumes that you know everything about SMTP and those kind of stuff. This book also often directs you to other sources for information, such as Microsoft's knowledge base and other books and those topics should have been discussed in the book. The author did not write all he knew about Exchange. Don't waste your money on this!!!"
5,YUM!!,"They are YUMMY for your Tummy!! It was worth waiting a little bit for them, and they arrived very fresh! YUMMY!!!!!"
5,Delicious Honeycomb covered in Milk Chocolate!,In the UK this is one of the most popular chocolate bars. It is a light honeycomb bar covered in Cadburys Milk Chocolate. If you like toffee and chocolate you will love these!
3,Criticism on C. S. Lewis' Critical Works,"Despite its title (THE TASTE OF THE PINEAPPLE: ESSAYS ON C. S. LEWIS AS READER, CRITIC, AND IMAGINATIVE WRITER), this book's stated aim is to offer the reader criticism on C. S. Lewis' criticism. The articles in it are divided into three sections: ""Part I: C. S. Lewis and the Critical Enterprise,"" ""Part II: C. S. Lewis: The Practice of Criticism,"" ""Part III: C. S. Lewis: The Critic as Imaginative Writer.""*The copy I had was paperback, and was published in 1998."
2,Works well until it breaks,"I've purchased two of these now, and they work really well for awhile. Unfortunately each of them have developed the same problem over the span of about 3 months each. A short in the wire somewhere near the iPod connector, which makes the cable nearly unusable. I won't be buying a third of this brand, I'll be looking for something a little more sturdy."
4,No more tagled cables,"Great for desktop stereo, give you plently of cable when you pick up and pull your ipod, then cleanly stows the extra after you put it down."
4,"Today's Love Songs, Tomorrows Blues "" Only A Foll Breaks His Own Heart""","Prysock's is at his best as time marches on so does the greatness of this legendary singer. He reaches the heart of every woman and sings to loves triumphs and trials. Rich tone, texture and depth are his testimony as you hear it from his soul."
3,Good for kids who like music,"This is a good thing for kids who like to listen to music, I got my 1 year old nephew this when I was on vacation, he loves to carry it around, (just the right size for him to carry) he know how to work it and he dances all night to the music on the radio. It does stink that you can not find cassettes for the radio, but a one year old would ruin them anyways, good for him to be independent and carry around by himself!!!"
1,don't bother - cheap,What a waste of $[...] ....it worked poorly for a week or two and then my son dropped it and nothing has worked since....the buttons are too small so you have to help them and it is not durable made for the dora-age audience.
2,Not exactly happy!,"Love the color and size. It's not a hard plastic, somewhat flexible. And, because it is a soft plastic, it must scratch easily, because it arrived with scratches on the outside as if it had been stacked in another one without anything in between. So mine is hiding, not for display. Too bad."
2,leaky and kinky,"As other reviewers have noted, the hose leaks from the flange and kinks easily. The leader should not be the weakest link, but in this case it was."
1,not so hot,The money I paid for this book could have been better utilized elsewhere...pretty words and goofy stories...I wanted some information!!!not a bunch of foolishnesssorry but I was disspointed...There are better books out there.
2,SDM Failure,"I would guess that most people that review this lens do so just after they buy it. If I wrote my review then I would have loved it as well. Now just after it is out of warranty, the SDM failed. (SDM failure is becoming a common problem with Pentax). Pentax sent me a replacement, and after 1 month of use, the SDM failed on that lens as well.I will not buy any more Pentax lenses with SDM. Hundreds of Pentax users have even signed a petition to Pentax to do something about these problems."
1,Certainly not a classic,"""Beyond Management by Objectives"" [1966] by Joseph Batten is rather disappointing and does not live up to the author's reputation. How this short volume ever made it to a second [1980] and then third [2003] printing is beyond me. Clearly his other two books ""Tough-Minded Management"" [1963] and ""Tough-Minded Leadership"" [1989] are superior, though in my opinion ""Tough-Minded Management"" is the better of the two. Readers will be hard pressed to find enough advanced leadership DNA in ""Beyond Management by Objectives"" so as to justify the two hours it takes them to read it."
3,Dyson animal ball,Pulled stuff out of our carpets that was incredible. Downside is that it sucks so hard that my wife and daughter found it to be heavy.
1,Arrived broken,"Advertised as reconditioned, but looked new. Very poor suction, so I followed the instructions for clearing jams- only to find that the hose connector was broken in three places- thus no suction! Called Dyson for advice- told to return it to Amazon."
1,Poor Deal Indeed,"originally we thought this was a good deal, the first Dyson we got lasted 2 days when the wheel at the back fell off and got sent back, the second (replacement) lasted a week when the little motor that drives the brush head shorted out and failed - its on its way back now and we wait for a refund.it might be a good vacuum - who knows?A poor deal indeed."
2,dyson vacuum referbished?,"My refurbished vacuum lost a wheel first use. Then the bar that holds up the vacuum stationary, broke on both sides.However, it does suck."
1,Whitney Houston-History On video-The Big Hits,First Of All Its Called THE BIG HITS!!The Video Is Home Made And The Pic Quality IS VERY BAD!!! DO NOT BUY YOU WILL BE WASTING YOUR MONEY!!!!YOU WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITH THE GREATEST HITS
3,Halex Select 2 Game Combination Set,"Poorly constructed. My husband bent one of the poles while setting it up, the shuttlecocks came apart after the second game, the small pump included to inflate the volleyball is a joke, the needle broke before the ball was inflated and my husband had to make a trip to Walmart for shuttlecocks and a pump before my granddaughter could play. I have orderd from Amazon for several years and this is the only bad product I have ever received; not worth the money I paid for it and could not recommend this purchase to anyone even though the cost was less than $40.Debbie R Willis Lafayette, TN"
2,"Okay, but don't expect it to last.","This set isn't the easiest to set-up. But, after you get it set-up it stays nice and tight. However, you don't want to take it down because it takes a while to set-up. If you leave it up, the wind will quickly break the flimsy plastic poles and it falls. It is fun, but I wonder if there isn't a stronger set out there..."
2,Does not work on portable DVD player,"Son just received this as a gift, but it would not play on his DVD player. On further exploration it appears to be an issue with the portable DVD player. We have a nice Sony portable DVD player (Sony DVP-FX930 9-Inch Portable DVD Player, Black) that has not had an issue with any other DVD in the 3 years we have owned it. Very frustrating.Obviously, if you don't care about the ability to play on a portable player, you would rate this higher, but that is a pretty big deal for us. I see from another review that this is a common problem with this DVD, so it is going back unfortunately."
3,"Love the Movie, but does not work in portable DVD","The Mickey Space movie is one of my daughters favorite movies, but we purchased this so she could watch in the car when we traveled. The problem is it does not work in the portable DVD player. I even returned the original one purchased and the replacement does not work either. The previews play, but the cartoon itself will not play. Every other DVD we have, including all of the other Mickey/Minnie cartoons work on the portable DVD player. Works fine on the regular DVD player so at least she is able to enjoy it."
4,pretty good,I love that Body by Jake does a pretty good job with the workout while not taking itself too seriously. A worthwhile purchase.
2,dissappointed,"After reading everyones review I thought it was a no brainer to get this dvd. However, I was dissappointed in the degree of boredom to this video. This is definately dated, which I knew, but the moves were a little more basic than what I had imagined."
1,One of the jaws broke,"After a short period of use, one of the jaws broke. This product worked great until the jaw broke. I will not buy this product again."
5,Fantastic book,"I am a former scientist, now working in the spiritual field. This book is exactly what I wanted....real scientific research, explained clearly, which substantiated the spiritual, intention-based work. I couldn't put it down. Highly recommended for anyone who thought there was no 'proof' out there. This book is highly readable, informative, and completely fascinating."
4,Not just another New Age tome,"I've read a lot of popular writing for the layman about quantum mechanics and the zero point field, and found this intelligent and interesting. I found the explanations of this difficult to conceptualize idea well done, and it gave a me a bit more of the quasi-mystical than I had bargained for, but it was actually a good thing as I tend toward the straight ""scientific"" explanations, and this author has a decidedly metaphysical bent. I enjoyed the book, but think that it bis better appreciated if the reader has already had some exposure to quantum physics."
2,This book is not very good.,"The author rambles on with story after story after story thinking that she is proving something...when her ""proof"" has no scientific basis or credibility."
1,Junk Science,"This is the worst. She laces the book with religious words and phrases saying nothing useful. Misusing quotes, citing only parts of findings. What a waste of money. Not only do I feel cheated but I'm lining her pockets. Don't buy the field, bury it in one."
1,Not what I expected,Being an Osteopath I thought it might have been a book on how one might be able to perceive the field. Unfortunately it is more about evidence for the field which is more theoretical than I had hoped for.
3,Bit of a disappointment,"When I saw Wayne Dyer recommending this book, I was very pleased. However, when I looked for the words ""God"" or love, they were strangely missing, until the next to the last page. I am ""naive"" enough to think that what bonds the field together is Love. I am somewhat afraid of New Age religion and ""science"" coming together to form a new ""religion"", as that what's today's psyops seems to want. I am less concerned with creating my day than I am seeing the formation of real community and intimacy. So the mistake was mine ..."
3,"Was ""Star Wars"" on to something?","Lynne McTaggart has opened up a hugely interesting topic, the question of a ""life force"". Is ""God"" perhaps our name for a unifying field of energy that shapes our existence? Are psychic phenomena such as telepathy, pre-cognition, and ESP simply vibrations in the fabric of the universe? Fascinating questions. She has done a tremendous amount of research well documented in the index. I was excited to read this book; I hoped to learn what modern science has discovered about this concept. Much of the book is pertinent to the scientific exploration of this topic, however I was disappointed with the inclusion of so much pseudo-science. She dismisses the work of skeptics much to easily and is too quick to accept minor deviations in case studies as significant. Those with an interest in the topic will enjoy reading the book, but unfortunately it can't be taken too seriously."
1,Buyer Beware--This CD is not the Book.,"The CD uses the title to Lynne's book ""The Field"" and the word ""unabridged"". This all implies to me that the cd is the book. I loved the book. If you think you're getting the book in any way, forget it. If you're a mystic and know you're going to get some type of free wheeling discussion of daily activities talking to people whose work may or may not have been in the book and maybe alluding to some of the content of the book, then buy the cd."
5,"Woody, musky sweetness","This has been one of my favorite soap brands for a long time but I have never used any shower creams from Roger & Gallet in the past. This was truly worth the splurge since the rich milk is soft and soothing on the skin as very little is needed, it has lasted me twice as long as the matching body lotion and it makes my morning and night bathroom routine a very pleasant experience.This lathers up nicely, not necessarily foaming bubbles but cleansing the skin with softness and care and a scent to rave about. The scent of vanilla sap is more creamy and almost like a sweet version of sandalwood than the usual vanilla bean fragrances everyone is used to. I adore using this since it feels so luxurious and lasts for a long time, making my bathroom cabinet look pretty and my skin silky soft. I highly recommend using it with the Roger & Gallet Vanilla Sap Restructuring Body Lotion for a complete experience.- Kasia S."
3,"Two great teams, too many charcaters!!","I've been a fan of both Goyer and Johns for quite awhile but this wasn't my favorite story. With so many charcaters between the two teams, there just weren't enough pages to flesh out who these guys are and why this story matters. The resolution to the conflict was too easy and Pacheco'a art got pretty sloppy at times. Just an okay read."
2,Hidden Talents: Hidden Boredom!!!,"When you first start reading Hidden Talents, you'll think, ""Wow, this is such an good book!"" but then, as many as 10 pages into the book, you realize that this book will satsisfy nothing in your mind, or anything for that matter. Hidden Talents is a fun book but much to boring for my likings, and no I did not like it. Read it if you're bored, and don't care if you elapse into a state of being REALLY bored. And that, my friend, is not good."
5,Inspiring,"I was moved as I read Michael Card's reflections on the crucifixion of Christ. He makes the crucifixion not only a theologically necessary event, but a personal action taken by the Father and the Son to restore us to a relationshiop with them and to demonstrate the amazing love they have for us. As I read, I felt like I was a witness to the events surrounding the trial and crucifixion of the Lord. Michael describes in detail the events leading up to the crucifixion, the suffering that Jesus endured, and the victory that was won. An amazing book! I would highly recommed it. What an awesome book to read as we approach the Passover and Easter season."
4,Beautiful,"This is a lovely CD for recorder fans. The first two songs alone are worth the purchase - in fact, I often set them on repeat, and only rarely listen to the rest of the CD (although the other songs are pretty too)."
3,A bit cheesy and far fetched but cute.,Once I started the first episode I had to finish the series - I didn't like some of the changes they made to the original story line but it ended up working for a modern spin on it and I am not sorry I watched it.
4,"another perfect adventure, but where is the 1.78 aspect ratio","I think this is even better then the Indiana Jones movies. Super fun adventure with spine tingling special effects.A must see movie, but I will wait for the blu-ray, 1.78 aspect ratio release before I buy."
3,Two good films and one so-so,"The first two movies are very good, in the old fashion Hollywood adventure way that many directors and writers seem to be going for. The first two DVDs have tons of extras and great commentaries. The third movie, The Scorpion King, feels more like a corny fantasy film, like the Gor flicks or a porn movie with all the sex removed. They have tons of extras also but the commentaries are kind of weak. If you don't have any of the movies I would suggest getting the set. If you already have the first two DVDs don't bother with this set. The first two DVDs, as the other reviewers have pointed out, are the same as those released before and I don't think the third DVD is worth getting. Unless you can get it at a low price. The third movie, in fact, is why the set has had two points removed. Overall, there are lots of sexy women and humor, but the third movie just falls flat on its face, even with the charming Rock starring in it."
5,Best Mummy Movies Ever,"These mummy movies, starring Brendan Frasier, are a hoot from beginning to end. Lots of action and lots of humor. THE SCORPION KING is a nice surprise. Very funny in places and quite watchable over all. Just plain good fun. Who has the popcorn?"
2,Information is missing,"What information that is in the books is wonderful. I was really excited to read though the book. A lot the information they said would be on their website that wasn't in the book, like curriculum reviews. The problems that the links don't work. It only contains a link to buy the book you probably already own. It is a real let down."
3,just okay,"I think that this book is probably an okay introduction for a family that is not currently homeschooling or just started homeschooling, like, a few weeks ago, but the title is misleading because it doesn't really, in my opinion, offer any magic bullets for problems that you get into one, two years down the line. This book is more like a homeschooling primer, or everything-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about-homeschooling-but-were-afraid-to-ask."
1,Possibly the Worst Book Ive ever spent $ ON,I think my 10 year old could have done a better job. Five star review?????????????? Somethings fishy here with thereviews. I bought this sight unseen and it is really awful. I love inspirational books but this one feels like itwas written by a young child. How did this get published and whats with the great reviews?
1,horrible,"do not buy this item, I had to type this review using windows on screen keyboard, because this keyboard did not work."
1,Pass this one by.,"I bought this keyboard to replace a malfunctioning Gearhead keyboard. But I started having problems right out of the box. Keys did not function. The mouse has to be within 3 feet of the receiver AND the infrared dot has to be pointed at the receiver. The feel of the keyboard (shape of the keys and curve of the board was very good. However the plastic is very rough and cheap, almost feeling like it's recycled. I don't think it will survive being dropped even once. I find it interesting that the keyboard signal is RF but the mouse is infrared (and therefore line-of-sight only). Why 2 different systems??No more cheap keyboards for me. I'm buying a good wireless Logitech unit."
4,Turn your spare LCD monitor into a TV!,"I'm not using it for a TV, but rather a monitor for a DVD-R in my girlfriend's office on campus. She needs to review source material for research and for classes she teaches. Her office is air-conditioned--our apartment is not. 'Nuff said about that. Anyway, the unit was set up in seconds and the pictue quality is much better than I expected from my old 12-inch (1024 x 768 pixel) NEC MultiSync monitor. The only flaw is that the remote contains too many crucial controls, and a full set of controls is not on the unit itself. Whomever designed it did not think hard enough about people who lose those kind of things. That said, the single speaker is surprisingly good, and the remote works great. Hopefully this will last as long as the DVD-R, and I'm sure it will outlast the LCD monitor."
3,"Cheap, but works","Although it obviously works, this product is of fairly low quality. I use one for tailgating and hook up an LCD monitor to it, while my GF uses the same setup (same tuner and monitor) as her main TV in her bedroom.Picture is pretty grainy and colors aren't very good. After using it to watch TV at my GFs a decent amount, I'd highly recommend paying the extra money and getting one that can do HD."
2,false product representation,"Wrong image was used to sell the product.Reseller did correct the problem.The service was timely, and courteous."
2,A handsome worthless alarm watch,"The watch is handsome enough but it is worthless as an alarm. The vibration is so miniscule that it can never awaken a normal human being. It doesn't even draw attention to itself when I am awake and anticipating the vibration.Don't buy this, OK? If you want to do something impulsive just write a check to me."
1,TERRIBLE - TERRIBLE - TERRIBLE,"I have ordered a wrist watch in august 2009 from amazon web page and managed the payment with my credit card.Although Amazon despatched the order by usps air mail on august 12 2009 i have not received it yet.when I ask my order in Amazon's my recent orders page ""You have no orders"" message occurs.I live in Istanbul Turkey and have to say that it is a shame for amazon. because there is no traking facility of the despatched orders after leaving the States.once again TERRIBLE AND TERRIBLE....That's all I can say...Ozcan YILDIZ"
1,Did not work on anything in my house.,"I purchased this set for use with our many USB devices - 2 phones, a TomTom, A Flip HD, and my Creative Zen X-Fi. Neither the house charger nor the car charger worked on any of these devices. Thankfully, I purchased this from Amazon and they processed my return and refund quickly. I love Amazon!"
5,Couldn't put it down,"I was so involved in this book I neglected my friends and family until I could finish finding EVERY SINGLE THING on the lists! I loved it, and even though it's almost useless to ME now that I've found everything, I'll keep it on the shelf and show/lend it to others who come to visit. Maybe in a few years I can pick it up again and start over; my senior moments are becoming more frequent, and I might just forget where everything was hiding!"
5,Ottimo venditore,"Mi ha fatto veramente molto piacere acquistare da te.Sei un venditore, molto preciso e serio.Itempi di consegna sono stati brevi ed i costi molto ragionevoli.A presto"
1,What a complete waste of money,"Not the nicest thing to say, but I found this book is acompletely waste of both money and reading effort. After reading Ms Aftels first book on natural perfumery, I had expected something similar and was deeply dissapointed. This is one tiny book, but so is Mindy Greens book ""Natural Perfumes"" and that one is surely worth every dime. The size of the fonts are too large = very little text on each page and the sad fact is, that it contains absolutely nothing new, that wasn't covered in Ms Aftels first book. Some of the pictures are beautiful, but so are the ones in other books on perfumery. The very few formulas that is offered are simple beyond simpleness and I believe that even beginner at the art of NP could come up with more inovative ones.My advice is - don't buy this book! If you is interested in natural perfumery, there are quite few books on this topic, that offers more knowledge and inspiration than this one."
2,other reviewers were right -,Buy Mandy's book Essential Alchemy if you want anything more that a 'bathroom' book. Essential Alchemy has a lot of good information and will get you started.
2,walter murch,i think walter murch books are overrated. who cares about what michael ondaatje thinks. he sure does.
3,A somewhat condensed book ............,"I bought a cd re-issue of Rosie's 'Love' at the same time as this, so am completely refreshed on that Clooney style. Sure the tracks here (too few, too short) come out of the 'Girl Singer's' repertoire, but don't expect any homage to be paid to the Clooney treatment of a lyric, this is pure Midler (and Manilow) and strays dangerously close to that bathhouse at times. Nothing much wrong with Bette's pipes you'll understand, but why the trade on memories. The real thing is still very much available."
3,Pretty Good,I dig Barry Manilow&the cat is tight as a Arranger&Here He is back together again with Bette Midler who has almost vanished from the Music scene in a way.Her past Decade of Music making has been all over the place&very little to feel good about.but Her Re-teaming with Barry Manilow is a Step in the right direction.some of the songs work but Her vocals on some are missing some flavor.but this is easily the best thing She has done in a really long time.I hope She&Barry will do another project soon wait another 30 years or so.
2,Bette Midler is best singing the songs of Bette Midler,"I was so disappointed in this cd. I love the voices of Roosemary Clooney and Bette, so I thought this couldn't lose. The only song with emotion was the one track with Manilow. In fact the music ""was"" the best part of the cd. I agree with another reviewer (that wasn't posted until after I bought my cd) don't get this tribute while the real thing is available, but I'd love to hear the real Miss Divine with her own new material. PS She did some of these same songs at her concert this month along with her own songs and she should have recorded it live. It was wonderful."
2,COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH MORE!,"AS A CLOONY FAN I PURCHASED THIS CD IN HOPES IT WOULD IN FACT BE A TRIBUTE TO THE BEST FRIEND A SONG EVER HAD. THE SELECTION OF MUSIC IS GREAT, AS IS BETTE'S STYLE OF EACH SONG. THE CHAT BETWEEN BETTE AND ""MANILA"" ON ONE TRACK SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SHORT SENTENCE OR TWO ABOUT ROSIE, INSTEAD OF THE NOT TOO FUNNY SELF PROMO. A TRUE ""LOVING TRIBUTE"" MEANS SO MUCH MORE - WHEN YOU TAKE JUST ONE MINUTE AND PERSONALIZE IT! BETTE YOU COULD(AND SHOULD HAVE) DONE BETTER."
5,Wonderful Bette!,"I am a huge Bette Midler fan, and have been since the age of 7 when 'Wind Beneath my Wings' came out. I must say that this CD is simply amazing. It truly shows just how great Bette is! She can do the standards as well, if not better, than the original performers! And this is the truth here! Not to knock Rosemary Clooney, I am a huge fan of hers as well, but Barry Manilow's new arrangements and Bette's new vocal stylings have completely renewed my love for these classic songs! Congrats Bette!"
1,I cannot believe this was ever released,"If you must hear Bette doing standards go see the movie For The Boys and buy the soundtrack, but this cd is just in bad taste. This is almost as bad as Barry Manilow's Sinatra tribute cd. Midler sings a dozen of clooney's biggest hits and makes them all into trendy pop tunes adding hip hip, and tyechno dance beats, and in so many ways is disrespecting the memory of a laegendary woman. I'm sure bette wishes she could take this back, but it's too late. This cd is not worth hearing once, let alone repeated listenings. This went straight into my waste basket. What a shame Midler might have hired a jazz combo and made a classy effort at tributing Clooney properly instead you have this mess of overproduced comemrcialism. I've never been so disapointed."
1,This is everything bad about electronic music.,"This is really a tragic album of two legends faking it. Rinky-tink arrangements done on the cheap with a Casio keyboard and ProTools. How can an entire album from these great talents sound like the WORST wedding band in history? The music is a shallow and tinny as their intentions. It is immediate elevator music.You MUST sample before you buy to appreciate exactly how absolutely awful it is. I paid full price. Don't make the same mistake I did. I am a huge fan of Bette's better work, but I'll never listen to this crap again."
3,OK; could have been better,"I'm sorry, but I can't share the enthusiasm of many of the other reviewers. First the good: Her versions of On a Slow Boat to China, Hey There, Tenderly, Come on-A My House, Sisters, and especially Mambo Italiano are very enjoyable. Personally I could do without This Ole House...it was a lousy song in the 50's and it still is. The bad: This CD is only thirty minutes long and has only 11 songs! I also don't like the song White Christmas on here; this isn't a Xnas album. Instead she should have done Count Your Blessings (Instead of Sheep) and/or Love, You Didn't do Right By Me. Like the song Sisters these two are from the movie White Christmas. And where are the songs Blues in the Night and Half As Much, both big hits for Rosemary? This was a nice idea, but should have been much, much better."
4,Fun with Bette,"Nice CD of the classics, however it is a little chatty on some of the songs. The first time you play it, it's cute and fun, the tenth time.... I'm over the jokesOverall well done"
5,AWESOME TRIBUTE,BETTE MIDLER HAS OUT DONE HERSELF WITH THIS GREAT CD. ROSEMARY CLOONEY'S SPIRIT IS ALIVE AND WELL.THE SONGS ARE ABSOLUTELY THE BEST.IT REMINDS ME WHEN I WAS A YOUNG BOY LISTENING TO ROSEMARY CLOONEY ON THE RADIO.BETTE AND BARRY MANILOW HAVE DONE A FABULOUS JOB AND I HOPE THEY DO ALOT MORE.
1,"I bought a Clooney cd, and Amazon recomended this..","Boy were they wrong, I love Bette Midler, I thought she was terrific in Beaches, and sang beautiflly on For The Boys soundtrack. However thsi cd made me disrespect both Barry Manilow & Bette Midler, Midler's arrangements here are a joke, just listen to Come On A My House it's all techno, and Mambo italiano is such an insult to the Clooney family.Bette you should have made your arrangements more tactfull or jazzy, like Clooney would have liked it. Aslo you capitalized on her death, and recorede her biggest hits instead of her best songs like Your The Top, Our Love Is Here To Stay, No lone, No Nothin'... This was a sneaky scheme thought up by evil genious Barry Manilow(a modern day Mitch Miller, who wants to cheapen music).Don't be fooled, it sounds like a great concept, Midler singing Clooney, it just doesn't work, it's overproduced and way too commercial."
1,DON'T BUY THIS ONE!,Bette Midler's voice is incredibly HOARSE and she has problems with her PITCH on this CD. She's never been a great singer - only average at best - and this collection does nothing for her or for listeners.SUGGESTION: Buy RoseMary Clooney's Greatest Hits instead ortry Barbra Streisand's THE MOVIE ALBUM which is remarkably good!
1,Oh Please!!,"How dare Bette Midler even attempt to put herself in the same category as the great Rosemary Clooney!This album continues to demonstrate Midler's inabilty to incorporate emotion in her performances. This material should evoke emotion in any performer, but Midler carries on the tradition of Barbra Steisand of being all ""pipes.""Do yourself a favor and buy ANY Rosemary Clooney CD before buying this Junk!"
1,You don't want this one...,"If you are looking for the wooden letter tray, this is not it. While it doesn't say in the description -- this one is plastic. You are probably looking for ASIN #B00006IALZ -- ""Eldon(R) Expressions(TM) Wood Letter Tray, Mahogany."""
1,Pushing Christian Agenda,"I thought from the discription (which was misleaing) that this was a book for mothers of pre-schoolers. This is actually a book, specifically for MOPS a christian group who go by the same name. Therefore the title is a misnomer. I have read 15 or 20 stories and ALL of them have been about God or refered to God and or ""church"". If you happen to be Christian, maybe this is good for you. But don't believe this is a book for ALL mothers of pre-schoolers, because it's not!"
5,Outstanding buy this disc!,"Toxic and 15 Other Love Songs is a great collection of power pop tunes. Each song on this disc is fun and demonstrates Roger Klug's amazing talent as a song writer, multi instrumentalist and producer. It is hard to imagine how Klug is able to write, record, sing and play (almost) every instrument you hear on this recording. Beyond the incredible talents of Klug, the songs here are witty, musical and just great to listen to. I am only sorry I did not discover Roger Klug years ago. Sometimes reminicent of the Beatles, Rundgren, Costello and other musical heros, Klugs work stands on it's own unique greatness. Buy this disc, you will not be disappointed and you may, like me, end up buying the entire Klug catalog."
3,An OK Book; Would Have Been Better If Read in 1996,"Andrew Grove does a really nice job of presenting the story of Intel and others in the context of his 'strategic inflection point' idea. I thought the book was well-written, insightful, and engaging.I started to get a little bored in the second half of the book though. In all fairness, the book was written 16 years before I read it. That is, it would have been really good (five stars) if I had read it then. Sixteen years later, I still found it to be worth reading -- but the stars start to fade over time."
4,A thougth provoking one,"A book which has been conceptualized well and organized well. The author brought up some good experiences to justify his points. The experiences are a well mix of good and bad. It has been very well described on how one can steer clear even when there is enough obstruction. Particularly, the chapters where he described how Intel has evolved to a microprocessor company from a memory company; how the RISC/CISC confusion resolved; are superb. The author also nicely explained his inidividual take on how to intercept the right message from the noise.Guess the term I coined from this book? It's ""Strategic Reflection Point"". It would be good for a while to use this (or may be a cozy one - SRP) to show off a know-it-all face till people start rubbishing it. It's certainly a good book, a thought provoking one, but comes handy for use only when you are a Chief --something-- Officer. Till then, read it to get a ring-side view."
4,A BOOK FOR NOT SO PARANOID NEW MANAGERS,"My feeling is I want to know more, not about the strategic inflection point and its consequences (known as well as technologial breaktrough) but on how to prepare for it, what are the signals (or noises) and what are the relationships between you as a manager (set the strategy, take decisions, resolve problems...) and you as a person highlty motivated not to say paranoid about work (time management, moving skills, relations networks...)"
5,Great live album!,"I was searching for music from 1959 for a 50th birthday party and stumbled across this. Although not all the songs were from 1959, it was a great addition to my playlist for this party. The party was in Rhode Island (home of the Newport Folk Festival) and they had just celebrated their 50th birthday! Enjoyed the music very much and have listened to it (on its own) many times since the party."
3,not leather as advertised!,"The content of this Bible is wonderful, but it is BONDED leather, not ""leather bound"" as advertised."
5,memory lane,"I got this for my daughters and I taught them the game as I remembered it from grade school. A host of neighbor kids have now learned and beg to come play. We couldn't find this in any stores near us and it was a shame to pay more for shipping than for the elastic rope but it was still worth the money for all the fun and group games they are all getting out of it. It has help up well. Safer than just tying together a rope for when they get to the ""kneesees"" level. We have to teach kids these kind of games we did or they will die with the generation at the expense of video/phone games."
3,Falls short,"I've never read this author before, he was recommended by a friend. The story had interesting pieces, but in the long run I found it difficult to care what happened to the main character. End was disappointing and seemed somewhat contradictory to the beginning."
3,"Not As ""Witchy"" As I Thought...","Let me start by saying that I am a fan of Paulo Coelho and this was the first of his books I read. I expected something a little ""witchier"" than this, but he did a nice job of bringing the Goddess into the main character, Athena. That being said, I never liked Athena, which made it hard to enjoy the story. The interview format, jumping back and forth really didn't help much, but it is essential to the telling of the story. As always, Coelho offers some wonderful insights and lessons on love and spirituality. I don't regret reading it."
5,Great service,The product was received in great condition and fast. Thanks so much! I would recommend this site to anyone looking for a great buy and help a great cause.
2,not my kind of book,"This book was chosen by the appointed person in our book club--it was disappointing to me. I read 100 pages and set it down. It's not my kind of book because it's too ""out there"". I'm not likely to start trance dancing to find my inner self. If you're at all skiddish about New Age stuff, this book isn't for you."
1,Some Books are Made for Burning,"After reading a lengthy article in The New Yorker devoted to Paulo Coelho and his writing,I was looking forward to an encounter with his fiction. Sadly, either I a made an unfortunate choice in ""The Witch of Portobello"" or if this is a true representation of his talent,Mr. Coelho needs to seek out and attend a remedial writing course.His writing is simplistic at its best and pure drivel at its worse."
1,She believes in drivel,Burn the book. This is so ridiculous. What the hell does this girl believe in and what is she trying to say.
3,Has Potential,"I just got this as a Christmas gift and it is fun! It works awesome on smooth surfaces and is fast as heck. Hard to control but still a blast. Its shortfalls however are the poor battery life. I got about 10-15 Minutes wort and the fact that it won't work over Carpet. I figured it would work but apparently it only works over Smooth surfaces, standing water, and ice. As soon as some snow comes down I'lll try it in the snow."
1,Rolodex Paper Clip dispenser,"This is a cheap lightweight imitation of the Rolodex product, and appears to have nothing to do with Rolodex.If you have ever handled the genuine product when you order this one then you will be, like myself, disappointed when you recieve this item.For the record, on the bottom of the plastic molding of this item the name ""Newell Office Products, Inc. Maddison, WI 53716"" and ""Made in China"".This is consistent with and reinforces the evidence that this has nothing to do with ""Rolodex"". The only connection is that it is an obvious copy of the original Rolodex.This is misrepresentation.Rolodex Image Paper Clip Dispenser (15891)"
5,Nice Introduction to Metallurgy,"This book is a nice introduction to the subject of metallurgy. It's well written and clear. Although it's not an in depth treatement of the subject, it should be a good introductory text for the technologist."
2,utterly mediocre,Was hoping for a video to supplement European History curriculum for high school students -- too little substantive information and I ended up only showing a very brief portion of this video about Peter's difficult relationship with his son
1,Child Rock Star Headset,"DO NOT buy this product. It is too small, even for my two year old's head (it was intended for my five year old's b-day party favors). The headset doesn't bend or stretch to fit on a head. The company I bought it from is giving me a hard time returning it (says it will take a 15% restocking fee). I will NEVER purchase from Totally Costumes again. Save your money!"
2,In Memory Of Michael Jackson 1958-2009,"I just finish looking at the In Memory Of Michael Jackson 1958-2009 DVD it is the same Documentary of Michael Jackson Life of A Super Star.if you have this do not buy it.Pat MintonLouisville, Ky."
5,Daughters of King: Finding Victory Through Your God-Given Personal Style,This book is an eye opener to a woman's personality in all areas of her life. I shared this book with 5 other women by purchasing them their own copy. This is one to keep on your shelf to refer to often.
4,for new programmers,"Often many programmers learn debugging by the sink or swim approach. Rarely in a computer science university education will much time be devoted to this crucial topic. But for the professional programmer, Metzger offers a systematic, disciplined approach. Examples are given in Java and C++. Actually, if you program elsewhere, you should still be able to easily follow the logic. He also shows how to effectively use a debugger to install breakpoints and step through code.Experienced programmers should not need this text. There will be little new for you. But it is well suited for newcomers. An easier way to learn than purely through experience."
1,kind of a disappointment...,"I love the look of this billow. The dark stain and nail heads are exactly what I needed to compliment the room decor but the billow leaks...It is very poorly made so it ends up just being ""for show"" and I bought a $10.00 one at Home Depot that is really ""cheap"" looking but works like a charm...Buyer beware!"
5,Worked like a charm...,"We just returned from a reasonably cold Tennessee campout. At 44, I am not interested in being uncomfortably cold. This product warmed our tent through the night with one tank change. It was not to heavy to pack in. The only concern is carbon monoxide emission. That can be avoided with opening the tent flaps. Two thumbs up for the tent heater!!!!!"
1,Not the Coleman I know!,"I like the quality of Coleman stuff. We have one of their campstoves, a lantern, and a couple of their sleeping bags(!) - all over 40 years old - that still work great. And I'm very pleased with our 5 year old Coleman grill and the neat little Coleman LED flashlight that I just bought.So I'm thinking that this heater must have come from some other ""Coleman."" Thing was put together so poorly that I had to take it apart and reassemble it before we could use it and, even with the fan feature, its heat output is marginal at best. I bought it to take the chill off one of our bathrooms on cool Florida mornings, and it does that - but just barely. I can't imagine it doing any good on a camping outing where the temps are freezing or below! Oh, and the handle design could be a lot better, too, IMO. Seems like it would be easy to drop - not a good thing considering hot surfaces and all.Overall, a below-average product, I'd say."
2,Died in the middle of the night and we froze,"I bought this heater as a tent heater for our cabin tent. We went camping in the mountains and pinned our hopes on this bugger to keep us warm. Around 1:00 am the propane ran out. Put in a new one in the ""frozen tent"" 2:00 am the batteries went dead. Brand new battery's were put in at 10:00 pm. Lasted 4 hours with the fan going. 3:00 am kids woke up frozen and wanted to go home. Put new batteries in and new propane at 3:30 am. Tent still frozen at 5:00 am. Decided to set up wood burner that came with tent even though it had never been used. Expected lots of smoke and choking kids but unbelievably the wood stove did not smoke and heated the tent up to about 70 degrees. Kids and spouse survived. Lesson learned. Do not depend on this Coleman heater to keep your tent warm at night."
5,Best one so far,This is the best movie of the eating out series so far. Can't wait until another is made. Definitely worth watching multiple times.
2,"Some highlights, but not as good as previous albums","This, the third concert album featuring Pete Seeger and Arlo Guthrie, does not measure up to their previous offerings, Precious Friend and Together in Concert. While the Ross Perot song and the Spanish language songs (except Guantanamera) are good, the rest are not strong performances. Seeger and Guthrie have probably performed ""City of New Orleans"" ""Wimoweh"" and ""The Hammer Song"" thousands of times, and on this recording, it sounds like it."
4,Great little oven,"I bought 2 of these ovens approximately 3 years ago. We have consistently used them and they are wonderful. I gave one to me son, and the one I currently have is really being abused. I know it will go out soon, hopefully I can find another one or two.This oven cooks any thing perfectly. The only problem is the timer needs to be a little longer than 15 minutes.love my oven"
1,Does not last long,"I have had two of these oven and they both lasted a little over a year.It smokes, very difficult to clean but cooks well when working."
3,TV-Guide Feature,"First, I must say this is a very nice set, however I must note that If you intend to use this set with a Cablecard the TV Guide feature will no longer work. I called Sharp and they admitted this was a problem. The TV-Guide feature is a good idea but Sharp has some work to do to get it to work."
5,Excellent Bike transport,"I assembled this cart myself, easy to follow instructions. It is made of excellent materials, and seems strong enough for my needs. I loaded this trailer with large packages and my bike handled fine. Really like the rain cover, and it is easy to get on and off my bike. We recommend extra hitches so each bike can use the trailer without removing the hitch.I use this to take packages to post office and to get groceries."
4,great sound,"Unfortunately I missed a booklet, if there was one. But this product was used so it might have been lost. Anyway the sound is great. Love it"
3,Defective copy or production?,"The concert is pretty good with varying types of the music, some of which I don't care too much for. But at least on my disk, there are three things wrong with it:1. The packaging and the DVD disk itself promise a DTS sound. Even though I have a DTS decoder as part of my receiver, there is no option in the disk menu to select that audio option.2. The editorial and the menu promises to have some interviews, but none was found on my copy of the disk.3. There is a moment or two of freezing in the middle of the last song that Paul Rodgers performs with the help of Joe Walsh. This may be due to the transition from one layer to the other, but it is the most apparent among my ""dual layer"" I have viewed."
4,Too bad you didn't watch this on Palladia TV,"Well, mostly I really enjoyed this concert. Perhaps just seeing some of these people again was enough to put the cherry on top. I certainly could have done away with some of the players to be replaced by at the very least - Eric Clapton, Richie Blackmore, Yngvie Malmsteen, Jeff Beck, Mark Knopfler. However, this made a lovely Christmas Holiday treat for my husband and me today (12/27/09). I don't think we'll buy the DVD however. We have the DISH Satellite so we get to enjoy the Palladia channel which shows many, many of these great concerts!"
1,On our 3rd camera already,"In January my daughter bought this camera after we read the reviews and decided on what features she wanted. However within 5 months the camera stopped functioning. We sent it to the Fuji Repair center and was told it would be fixed or replaced within 2 weeks. It took six weeks to receive a replacement. Five weeks after getting this replacement the exact same thing went wrong - the camera starts up, the lcd panel goes blank, the lens won't retract and the only way to turn it off is to remove the battery. Nothing can be done but to send it in for repairs again. My daughter is hoping it won't take another 6 weeks to get it replaced (again). NOT RELIABLE!"
1,Ugh!,"Flash is just way too bright. I played with every setting available- party, sunset, night, museum, auto - they either turn out horribly bright and washed out or fuzzy or out of focus! My film point and shoot had much better quality, what a disappointment."
5,Top Notch Book,"As an experienced graphics user with a number of graphics books, this one was a breath of fresh air. All of the aspects of Carrara are covered with information and instructions that should be easy for a beginner to follow while also having what an experienced user needs as well. The examples are top notch and not only show off what the software can do, but does it using examples that are not normally seen. A lot of quality tips and tricks in the book as well. A CD with a lot of quality content is included and it is too bad that some of those execptional images did not make it into the book as well. Certainly worth spending time on. It also includes the full demo copy of Carrara 3, the latest version. A great way to explore the software before you put down the full price for it. With the execptional output from this software and the high quality of this book, you will want to keep both close by."
3,Groomsmen gifts,"A good product definitly, no question there. Arrived promptly, in less time then predicted. Gifts for our groomsmen, were a big hit! The engraving was just the icing on the cake.And now for the drawback. It says that you will be emailed after purchase, detailing how the engravings will go and asking you what you want and with which font. We never recieved this email! After a few hour I got an email confermation saying it was shipping. I contacted the seller thru amazon with no response, and finally after a bit of internet searching, had to call the company directly and get it all sorted.Moral of the story, great product, perfect engraving, but you will need to chase the seller, only thing that lets this product down."
5,Good book for undergraduate study.,"It's a good book. The wording is precise and clear, there are plenty of examples and diagrams, and it seems to be well organized.Definitely of reasonable caliber for undergraduate study."
1,Bad quality control,"After buying this lens I noticed that most pictures were ""soft"" on the right side. Not on the left. I then did some more specific testing at all focal lengths and aperture values, and found out that the lens was decentered. This lens has had a very big quality control problem that you can read about all over the net. I thought I might get lucky, but I was wrong. Luckily I bought it from Amazon. They have such a great return policy.As of 1/25/10 quality control problems for this lens have NOT been fixed. SDM failure is quite common. In fact, there is now an online petition to Pentax about this with over 400 signatures. I went through 3 of these lenses (one SDM failure, two with decentering) before I gave up."
5,Stunning lens,"It's too bad there are bad copies out there because the only thing thing I can say about my copy is ""stunning."" Well, there are other adjectives but you get the idea;)I've had mine for a little over a month now and it's by far my favorite lens. Crystal clear sharpness, incredible colors, great bokeh, and wonderful contrast. For me it's the perfect walkaround lens--although I wouldn't mind getting my hands on a 31mm Limited!My copy does have very, very slight vignetting at 16mm at 2.8 but it's never been annoying, but it can be easily PP'd out if need be. I didn't mark it down for this because it is so slight and is actually pleasing to the eye, imo.One thing, however, is you should buy it from a reputable dealer with a good return policy so if you do get a bad one it won't be a hassle to return it. I have to say, though, that this lens is so good it's worth taking the risk."
3,Quality control issue,"I have mixed feelings about this lens, I love the look fit and finish but am having problems with front and rear focus. I have a focus test chart and depending on my focal length, I could have front focus problems on the left side while rear on the right all at the same time. I have sent this lens back yesterday and already ordered another one from Emmy photo because Amazon was out of stock. I am so impressed with the photo quality when you get the focus right that I would hate to live without it. If the new lens that I get works properly, it will hardly ever be removed from the camera body. I have my Sigma 18-250mm on for now and what a difference in color richness and contrast, the Pentax 16-50 is by far superior."
3,Extremely Fragile,"This nightlight is extremely fragile. It looks better in the picture shown than it does in person. It doesn't light up the Lithophane image as much as I thought it would. This product only lasted me a few months, then my 1 year old daughter got a hold of it and it snapped in 2 pieces. Although it has a beautiful image, it is not exactly what I expected and I was slightly disappointed."
4,Great book,My girl is 8 and loves Katie Kazoo. It is a great book for her to read by herself and I don't have to worry about the content in it.
3,average,The handle is nice and comfortable. I don't feel it peels any better than my 40 year old cheap one. However cheap products were still decent quality 40 years ago. I have certainly used worse ones that are made in the last few years. I guess I expected more from the descriptions. It's still a potato peeler.
1,Can't use it left-handed,"I believe this is the same Oxo swivel peeler I bought, and I can't use it as I'm left-handed. It appears the blades are angled such that they don't work if the peeler is held in my left hand, which is how I peel.I like many of Oxo's products, but not this one because of its severe limitation."
2,House Boy's Opinon,"This item doesn't perform well without a lot of hand pressure on the cutting stroke A real disappointment! It's almost as if the angle of the cutter blade is off or the cutter edge is dull. I tried cutting with both a push and a draw stroke and the results remained about the same. Because of the ""pressure"" needed to cut peels the item skips leaving unpeeled areas and is hard to control. I went back to using my old two inch peeling knife!"
5,It just works! Fantastically!,"I've had the same potato peeler for the past five years and I thought it was perfect for what I needed. And it was. I finally had to buy a peeler for my mum and looked around for a similar (non-swivel) model and could not find any. I'm always leery about sharper objects twisting a bit, so I thought I'd give it a try. Boy have I been missing out...The peeler does a fast and fantastic job of cleaning potatoes without the skipping you may get from older, duller peelers. I don't feel threatened by overly sharp edges on it. Works well whether my hands are wet or not - no slipping around at all. Rinses quickly and retains its finish. And of course, has the usual Oxo ""comfy grip."" Overall, it's wonderful buy for the price."
4,Nifty tool,"Before we had this, we were peeling with a paring knife; this was a huge improvement. The big handle makes it comfortable to hold and it peels all kinds of vegetables perfectly. The tip (to removed eyes from potatoes and the like) isn't as sharp as I'd like, but I suppose that makes it safer."
5,Wonderful story and artwork,We bought this book in a gift shop in Hawaii 2 years ago and it has been a favorite ever since. My kids are now 8 years old and 5 years old and both love the story. Baby Honu is a tiny baby sea turtle who learns that no one is too small to make a big difference. The artwork is bright and colorful and looks as if a lot of heart went into it and the story. The only thing that could make it better would be if I could find an audio version where it's read in a Hawaiian accent!
5,"Great book, essential to pass embryology material","This book covers the basics of embryology including outstanding diagrams. In places, it has too much detail, but it is very well written and the illustrations (essential for learning embryology) are beautiful."
1,Do not buy this book,"I was supposed to purchase the 2001 version but by mistake i purchased the second hand version which was in 1997. I am not sure how the latest version is but i WARN u, DO NOT BUY THE OLD VERSION!!! i am literally researching each and every paragraph. I don't understand JACK!!There are hardly any pictures leaving ur mined to wonder away.it took me 2 days to figure out the first page.a very demotivating book i must say!I strongly suggest you go to ur library/book store to check the latest version out first before u buy it.Very disappointing book.made me doubt my career choice in medicine for a second.dont buy the old version.not sure wat the new version is like and i wont even bother!!"
4,A solid read,"This book has some interesting tips and tricks. It would probably be a good read for developers that aren't too deep into the Swing framework, because most of the examples provide quick ways to accomplish various tasks without having to know the swing framework inside and out."
5,027 Remote Uncoupling Track,This 027 Remote Uncoupling Track was shipped fast and was as described just what I needed for my layout it worked great right out of the box came with wires and controller the price was good from amazon. thanks for reading -- batsmith
4,good graphics okay story,"I loved the illustrations of this comic, the combonation of color and vivid view of things.They could have worked out the kinks in the story though."
2,Not quite worth the price,"I bought this DVD together with Fresh start snowboarding DVD. I have to say I like the other one a lot more.The information provided in this DVD isn't too bad, but too short for it's price. It follows a first time snowboarding student through her lessons. The first few chapters are really nice explaining how to choose your snowboard for the first time.But when it gets to the actual snowboarding technique, this is where it falls short. You get to hear what the teacher briefly and shortly teaches the student. Then it shows the teacher does it once, and shows the student does it onces. Repeat that for every technique.This can be a nice overview for first time snowboarder I guess. But still, with this amount of information, it's not worth the price. You can find free lessons online with even more information than this DVD with even longer explanation.I highly recommend the Fresh Start Snowboarding DVD and the tutorial at abc-of-snowboarding over this one."
2,Not very good,"I found that this video wont be of much value for beginners who want to improve their snowboarding abilties. Some of the information presented is useful but most is just superficial or poorly explained. The concepts in the lessons are not explained well enough for a beginner to understand and translate what's being taught onto the slopes. I thought this video could have been a lot better but after watching it, it really falls short of being useful. [...]."
4,Gets you at the end,I had accidentially sent this in a box of books to my husband in Afghanistan. I wondered where it had gone to until he called one day talking about it. He really liked it and said that the end messed (wasn't exactly his word but I cleaned it up) him up.I have to agree. The story is good and the pacing is smooth but when I read the end it brought on the WOW factor.He and I are both zombie fans and we appreciate the different angles authors are throwing into the mix; this one included.
3,3 Arks?,Interesting perspective -- but not exactly what I was looking for on the Ark. I had hoped this was more spiritual and Biblical -- rather than a compliation on the rumors of where the ark might be. i am teaching the Sanctuary and the meaning behind the various articles contained in the Sanctuary -- hence my interest.
5,God bless Elvin Jones,"A must for Be-Bop lovers. Elvin Jones is the master and, regretably, there will probably never be another drummer who even comes close to his combination of talent, skills and ability."
4,A good read for young adults,"What you expect isn't always what you get. After hearing a book talk about Stained Glass I was very excited to pick it up and read it. I soon realized that though the book was well written, it may be a better read for someone who is a bit younger than a junior in high school. The middle of the book tended to drag on a little more than what was necessary to compelete the novel. But I sitll managed to get caught up in the story of Charles and Ambriel. Charles goes to St. Bartholomew's church to skip his paino lessons. One day he hears a crash and finds that the church caretaker has accidentally broken a stained glass window. The broken window falls on a homeless girl and causes her to lose her memory. Charles cannot seem to shake this girl from his mind and ends up on a sojourn through his hometown of Caledon looking for clues to the homeless girl's past...."
2,Multicultural Education,"Unlike the authors of this book, I will admit that I approach education with a bias. I believe that progressive ideas have done much damage to education in America. So needless to say, I wasn't looking forward to having to read this book for a CLAD course. To me, this book is very frustrating and one-sided, pushing a particular political agenda -- even though they don't say so. I found very little opposition research to show that the authors wanted to give teachers research from both sides when discussing tough, academic questions. Instead, the book is filled with self-fulfilling research that doesn't look at other possible causes for problems faced by today's educators. Maybe if those responsible for teaching the teachers would present both sides of the story and let the ""educators"" decide, then the teachers would be able to do the same with their students. But that is probably too much to ask of progressive minded people."
2,Informational text,"This is informational.... and that is about it.Boring, dull, droll... don't read it unless you have to."
2,"Really difficult to read, but it was a requirement!","Such a difficult book to read. It felt as if the authors had 2 chapters of concrete evidence and then took these 2 chapters and tried to expand them to fill an entire book. I felt as if I was having deja-vu throughout my entire reading of it. Some topics that I thought had been clarified again kept popping up and restasted the same idea in a couple pages worth.The author's need to take a course in which they don't use 6 different words to say the same thing. I read about a paragraph of information and the author's didn't clarify the idea, they kept giving me the run-around. For example: "" This race can be an exciting, joyful, enthusiastic, jolly, joyous, blithful, peppy, perky, blessful, and gleeful bunch. "" These author's really let you know that they used a Thesaurus, but after a couple hundred pages of reading sentences or paragraphs full of synonyms it really gets annoying."
1,Defective!,"Several months after purchasing this espresso maker, the bottom started bulging out and separating from the rest of the unit. I wrote to WMF's customer service and they refused to replace the item stating that I must have been using it over extremely high heat. I had used only on my stovetop but they still refused to take responsibility for the defective item. It's a nice-looking espresso maker but be forewarned!update: I sent the espresso maker back to WMF. Not only did they refuse to replace it, they sent it back to me with the top broken off. When I wrote to let them know they sent it back in worse condition than it had arrived, they never got back in touch. zero stars"
5,"Sharp, quality German manufacturing.","I gave up coffee, but am sad to see this little guy go.The base screws tightly, the seals fit very well, the stainless is truly stainless. The design is classic. I don't know why others have complained about the sandwich disk breaking. Perhaps theirs were defective, but more than likely the flame was put on high, crawled over to the sides. Which is something that I'm pretty sure would break-down most any espresso maker ... especially the ones with the plastic handles (they melt)."
4,recommended reading,"Wow! I strongly recommend this for young adults and adults looking for a great fantasy-adventure story. The author should be congratulatedfor a very clever book! Interesting characters, plot moves along quickly, enjoyable witing style. I also listened to it on CD and it was excellent. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel. Give this a read, you will be glad that you did."
3,Some 1st book mistakes but still worth the read,"Some pacing and continuity errors kept me guessing as to weather or not I felt the book was worth finishing but let it not be said that Stuart Hill isn't talented. I've found that the lower points of this book usually balance out due to some very witty descriptions and remarks. Thirrin, the main character, becomes loveable enough throughout the story. All in all this is an above average book. If you were disapointed by Garth Nix's Aborshen series you'll find this book much more readable."
5,The best thing since spinach dip and rye bread,"Quite an amazing cookbook. I'm not a vegetarian, but I found this to be quite helpful in adding a bit of variety to my weekly menus. I highly recommed both the spicy Thai noodle and the mac and cheese recipes."
5,Love it!,"This cookbook is fabulous. I've never eaten at The Grit, but now my carnivore husband wants to travel to Athens to eat there. Every recipe I've tried from this book has been a huge hit."
3,The Grit Cookbook,"The cookbook is just ok, nothing great. I had never been to the Grit Restaurant. I haven't liked many of the recipes. The food is not what I expected, I thought it would be healthy food."
3,Steel demon blade,"Used to cut steel tube (.065 wall), in a miter saw. Worked well in this application, especially when brand new and sharp. After about 10 cuts the quality of cut was noticeably worse, but still acceptable. Blade performance seemed constant after that, for many more cuts."
5,Good Battery,This works just like the original Dell Axim X50v battery. What more can you ask for? I'm satisfied.
5,Thank you Mr Kofler!,"I have just bought this book a week ago (together with the book Linux Complete) and all I can say is ""Thank God"".Finaly a buck worth reading. I love the help this book gives and the results. ***Nothing feels better, than to follow well written instructions and see the ""working"" result***. (please read the last sentence again:)I whish I bought this one first. It would have saved me hundreds of wasted $$$ (canadian <g>;)"
5,Rubbermaid Space Savers,Bought 2 sets of three to tidy up a very small office space - worked great to clear off desk.
4,Unlocked my Creativity and enthusiasm again!,"This was a great story. After some 20 years in video production, and having dreams of my own short films dashed by the day-to-day reality of my work, it was refreshing to read. Rodriguez's passion and his eventual ""homerun"" in Hollywood made me think that my dreams were possible again.I'm going back for a second read."
4,Great,It came promptly and I love this book! It is very inspiring for a would be film-maker or film lover.
4,Gas for the beginners,"This book builds up the moral for all young peopleout there - people with their home cameras and dreamsabout big time in art and/or movie business.Thumbs up for Robert, this is what the youth should be."
4,Dust off that camcorder dude!,"Fun and easy reading book about a young man making a movie on the cheap just so he can get his first ten bad movies out of the way before making a good one. Fancy this first effort to hit it big in Hollywood! Inspiring stuff, and especially inspiring considering he never expected this el-cheapo B-rate Spanish language movie, made with volunteer actors in a border town, to amount to anything but a practice run for the Mexican video market if he was lucky. Get it, read it, write down that script you have in your head and go dust off the old camcorder and start shooting!This book also has lots of cool hints as to how to make expensive looking scenes!"
4,Excellent Book,I did enjoy this book a lot - it is well-written and is more like a diary about Robert Rodriguez. It tells the story of how he did with little money and ended up with a big hollywood success - a true american story.
5,my civil service,"good enough, a bit old from last certury, helpful but a little brief and i wish it had more practice questions, good tips, nice contents, helpful information, concise"
5,All you need to know,"I'm no big fan of the Clintons, but this book, which is totally documented, leaves no doubt that Hillary Clinton was not exaggerating when she accused a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"" of attempting to destroy her husband and her. What is truly shocking, however, is how the press (and we're not talking Matt Drudge here, but the most prestigious newspapers and magazines) joined in to create the impression of Watergate-type scandals based on the flimsiest--or even no--evidence at all. this is an invaluable book."
2,EEK! It's the Vast Right Wing Conspiracy!,"A lively read, but the authors don't seem to realize that there are no heroes and villains in this sordid case. When may we have book that effectively plagues both houses?"
2,not so tuff,got these tuff balls for our 1 year old husky and he had them torn apart in less than a day. the outside skin didn't rip apart like a regular tennis ball would but the ball itself can crack and lose its shape very quickly if you let them chew on it for a while.
5,cards,"plenty of card games to choose from, life like players and diffacult levels. very good practice to improve my game, can keep me busy for hours."
2,microfiber side panels not supportive enough,"I wore the Olga (regular) tapestry minimizer bra for many years with great success, but since it's no longer available I've been trying the Olga Today model (and also the Christina - not sure if there's any difference). My main objection is the side panels, which used to be the same (stiffer) tapestry material as the bra, but are now stretchy microfiber. also, the fastener panel in the back seems to be narrower than it was. This all makes the bra much less supportive to my back, and I'm going to have to abandon the bra. I'm sorry that I ordered any."
2,Just couldn't keep it on,I gave this product 2 stars because I simply could not wear it for more than a couple hours at one time. The seam of the sock went across my toes causing my big toe to become numb and painful. In addition the sock made my leg sweat. Wish it would have worked better has been a long struggle to get my plantar fasciitis under control.
2,Too large for ladies,"I am a 5'4"" woman, weigh 115 lbs. and wear a size 6 shoe. I purchased the regular size, not the large. At first I was concerned the size of the calf (up to 16"") would be too large, but it's not, you can tighten it with the velcro. The problem comes with the length of the sock itself, it is so long that it goes over my knee (I have long legs for my height). If I put it below my knee and tighten it, then I had to adjust the velcro to the maximum it would stretch and it began pulling more on my toes than my foot itself. It looked and felt like I was wearing my fathers socks. I did wear it for the night, but in the morning my toes hurt a little. I'm disappointed, it looks like this product should work but I cannot recommend it for the average woman. I hope that down the road the manufacturer makes a smaller version."
2,Poor fit on calf,"It says that it fits up to a 16"" calf but was too tight to wear and my calf is not that large."
1,Too stretchy!,"This is just too stretchy that it is not affected. It pulls your toes up but not enough because it stretches out too long. And in the middle of the night, your toes go numb. The best thing to use for PF is a hard night splint with the toes out because your foot will stay where it suppose to be throughout the night and toes are free. That's what I got after sending this back. It works so much better!"
2,Didn't work for me,"This product was recommended to my by a phyical therapist helping with plantar faciatis. Prior to my purchase I checked reviews which were good. My calf is an average size. The sock is long, which needs to be pushed down so the velcro band is right below the knee (per the instructions). When the sock was first put on it held my foot in the proper position. I found that by morning, my foot was not being held forward. To me with the sock being so long, my foot movement during the night pulled the sock down and my foot was able to flex and not held forward they was it is supposed to help stretch the muscles. This did not work for me."
1,Hurts my toes!,This product canot be worn by someone with planter facitis as it hurts your toes. I was looking forward to receiving and trying this sock only to discover it was a waste of money
3,Strassburg Sock,"Used this to treat my own plantar fascitis. Being a physical therapist, I finally got to experience what past patients have endured. Not so fun obviously. I bought this item based on the reviews of various night splints getting hot at night, additionally a friend complained of the same problem with a splint to treat her plantar fascitis. This item helped decreased morning pain by keeping the plantar fascia stretched out but the main problem with it is that it rides down a bit during the night. As the velcro strap at the top is not good at keeping it fixated there. Also not walking much for 2 and half days and treating it right away helped decreased the pain. Pro: Comfort, Con: Cost, Sock riding down."
4,Works well but not super comfortable,"These work better than any other ""wear while you sleep"" treatments for plantar fasciaitis (sp?). They cause some pain for me at the tips of my toes after extended use. I find that I can't keep them on all night, but they are way better than any alternative I've found. You can also walk around without having to remove them, and they aren't too cumbersome. If only they made this sock in a way that caused less discomfort at the tips of my toes, it would be perfect."
4,Enjoyed it,I enjoyed reading the articles and found most to my ideas. Thought it was well written and amusing in part.
3,Independant & Awesome,"I have been reading Salon for years on their website and it is now a pleasure to be able to have it delivered to my Kindle. I would prefer, however, if they delivered in more of a blog format similar to the New York Times Current News for Kindle."
3,It works but don't go too far..,It works! (though I had to buy a frequency transmitter to make it work in my country) but it works with a little fuzzing sound if you turn away from the reciever. Unfortunately it didn't work out side my room (4X5 M). As soon as I get out side the door it stops working.But in general it is great if someone is sleeping in the room.
4,absolutly creepy; not really scary,it wold have been 5 stars i the actors weren't no paranoid. but it was very creepy. the actual boogeyman was very scary and atlot of scenes were intense and entertaining.
4,Boogeyman,The movie has nothing to do with the 2. part....Its not bad...but the 2.part is much better.Anyway if you like scary movies go ahead and by it:))))))
2,The best part was only Lucy Lawless,"When I first saw this movie I thought I was going to see something scary and be scare when I got home like I was with The Grudge,but I was so mad that this movie was only scary sounds that I could'nt even stay in the movie theatre without being annoy. The only part of this movie that was scary was only lucy lawless who scare the crap out of me, but whats sad about this movie is that the lucy lawless part which is small is worth watching this movie."
2,Boogeyman,The movie boogeyman is what i would call a pop up movie. The only scary thing is when your sitting there about ready to fall a sleep something stupid pop out of nowhere. I thought that the movie didn't really have a plot. The movie had revolved around the idea that the boogeyman is under the bed and in the closet. I think they could of did a better job.
2,TONS of missed potential......,"Boogeyman could have been a very scary film except that the director and producer wanted that all-important PG13 rating. This is killing the horror movie as an art form; Boogeyman is a clear case of shocks traded in for an imaginary audience who likes bloodless horror movies (like ""The Ring"").This movie sets up an interesting story, then does almost nothing with it. And the ""surprise twist"" in the film was a surprise only to the 5 year olds in the audience taken to this film by their baby-sitterless parents.I miss the old ""Hellraiser"" days when horror films strived for an ""R"" rating and wore it as a badge of honor. I hope Hollywood will start making films like that again."
1,One of the worst horror movies I've seen,"I thought this movie was going to be good, but I don't see what was scary about it at all. It started out looking like it could be scary, but then it ended up being ridiculous. It didn't seem very believable to me that an adult man would still be afraid of the same things as when he was a child. The movie was very boring to me. There were too many scenes where nothing significant was happening. I only finished watching it because I thought it would be worth it to finally see the boogeyman later on in the movie, but I was even more diappointed when I saw it. The monster's CGI was too terrible for it to even be scary. The ending also wasn't very good and left too many unanswered questions. I would only recommend this movie to someone who likes one of the actors or actresses in it. If you want a good horror movie that's worth watching, this isn't it. Some better horror movies are ""The Ring"" or ""The Sixth Sense."""
1,Boogeycrap,"Boogeyman is a clich of bad movies rolled into one. It's the textbook case of an unscary movie. There the darkness, loud noises, quick edits. You have to turn up the speakers because of the soft spokeness, then you bust the speakers when the jolt comes. The CGI is awful for 2005. Boogeyman is just a bad movie."
3,Boogeyman scares the snot out of you!,"A young boy witnesses his father being adbucted by the boogeyman in his bedroom. 15 years later the boy returns to face his fears. There were some scary scenes throughout this, but the movie falls apart at the end. It's all shadows and mood lighting to spook you out throughout most of the movie, but when we finally see the boogeyman at the end, he looks cartoonish and the fright is gone. The ending was weak."
1,UGH......,THAT was Lucy Lawless? Except for some rather odd angled eye candy this one sucks big time.What's the fuss?Would love to see how the careers evolve....
3,Boogyman comes to life.,I enjoyed this movie. I was not as scary as I thought it could have been but still brought back childhood fears.
1,ummm...,wow this movie was pathetic..if i could give it negative stars I would. Easily one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Just awful..
4,NOT BAD,"Barry Watson did his part in this movie, we all know him from 7th heaven,it could have had a better story line but i wouldnt consider this lousey..some sences were pretty good acually, Im a fan of Barry Watson soo ima give this 4 stars..you could watch this more than once for sure.."
5,A page-turner that moves on many levels,"A story you cannot put away until you have reached the last page. The relationship between the two characters is a little complicated, as are the emotions and thoughts of the Professor Streng character. The language is on an upper level, some words I never got, however, that did not stop me from reading the novel which turned out the BEST philosophy book I have ever read and understood (in part). The book is must for anyone interested in philosophy but who got stuck with a boring professor or loser textbook. Also, the fact that you get ethics, philosophy, logic, and history all in one book is more incentive to buy it."
1,AVOID THIS DVD RECORDER,"After eight days the DR-4's copy protection function kicked in, preventing us from further recording off any broadcast channel. It was exchanged for a different name brand and we have had no trouble recording approximately 50 films off standard, digital and HD stations.While stations might block programs for recording through devices connected via HDMI/DVI this is not the case for standard DVD recording. It is the fault of the Toshiba, as stated by many others on this thread."

5,Beautiful and touching,"I am so thrilled to see that this lovely book is available again. My grandson received this book from my sister as a christening present and we have read it together more times than I can count. The beautiful pictures and soothing tone of the book held his attention when he was very young, and Zenele's question and the wonderful answers from the animal kingdom intrigued him as he grew older (3 and up). I plan to buy 2 more copies right away - one for my church's nursery and one as a first birthday present. Don't be concerned that this book is religion-specific; it works for anyone willing to consider the question, ""Who made me?"""
3,"Love this game, but won't work with Windows 7","This was one of the first computer games I was addicted to, I could play it for days. After not playing it for years I was looking for a fun game and thought I'd try this again. The only problem is that it won't work with Windows 7. After looking for some fixes, I did get it to start, but it always freezes after 10 or 15 minutes of playing. Not enough time to build a city and complete campaigns. I still love the game, just wish I could actually play it!"
5,Pharaoh Memories Revisited,"Loved this game back in the day when it was new, love it even more with the Cleopatra expansion. Perfect versions of this software."
4,Yay,"Glad I was able to find copies of this game that were compatible with my version of Windows! Would've been nice to know ahead of time that I would need to change some compatibility settings to get it to work though, instead of trying to reinstall it numerous times b/c I kept getting error messages and having to hunt for the answer on Google."
2,"Error is marketing, Error overall","When I first saw it online, the description said it was for MS Win 98, XP and Vista, but on reading the fine print on the box, it was designed for MS Win 95, 98 and XP. A little off, but even so or because of it, the graphics aren't as good as MS AOE series and seems really dated. Caesar IV, a game I got at the same time, is superior only in graphics, as the gameplay doesn't provide much help, with advisors complaining, without providing solutions and no way of lopping off their heads."
3,Knife and crumb tray,"I like my knife and crumb tray but I would like the crumb tray better if were not all warped! Because it is not at all level, it is hard to cut all the way through the bread. The knife is great though.I did not use the tray until after I had thrown away the box and invoice because I knew I wanted it and, truthfully, I did not even think about the possibility of warping. My loss.Marianna Settles"
5,Love this product!,"I have tried the prescription meds suggested to me by my dermatologist, but this is much, much better - and less expensive!"
4,A fast read!!!!!!,It's a great summer read. I took it to the beach and was done in 2 days. The book is pretty hot. Especially if you are into Maledom erotica.
4,Anne Rice Got Her Mojo Back,"I'd quit reading Rice years ago for reasons outlined by other reviewers. But when I put down this book, I thought ""Ms. Rice got her mojo back."" It was satisfying to be in the world of Lestat again and the combination with the Mayfair witches was deft. Generally speaking, this book didn't reach the fun readability of Queen of the Damned but it's worth the time to read. I somehow doubt this is last we'll hear from Lestat. The fair doctor and the vampire brat in love make for great reading."
1,the best most boring book ive ever read,i am really disappointed in rice. she did such a good job with the first few. i couldnt put them down and now i cant keep my nose in it.i am really bummed that i went out and bought it only to fall asleep with in the first 100 pages.
1,Long and nothing happens,"I've read a few of Anne Rice's books before, and I usually liked them. I thought I was going to try this one as it involved ghosts. To be honest, I haven't finished the book yet, but in 172 pages, nothing has happened. The narrator and main character, Tarquin Blackwood tells his story to Lestat the Vampire about his family, hoping he can help with his haunt, Goblin, sometimes good, sometimes malicious. This sounds more like a biography of a fictional character rather than a ghost story. As much as I don't mind and understand that you have to introduce characters in order to understand what goes on in their mind, etc, 172 pages worth of this is just too much and I don't know how much longer I'll be able to read on. I'm highly disappointed."
4,Quin A Refreshing Character,"I really enjoyed this novel. I liked Quin a lot. I especially like the intersection of The Vampire Chronicles with the Mayfair Witches. There was a good chunk of story that could have been cut from this novel and the novel would have remained the same. Sometimes Ms. Rice can get carried away with herself and the flowery writing style she employs. Overall, it was an excellent novel."
2,Why the FLUFF?,"Wooose. Maybe I am partial to female protagonists, but why is this one so ambivalent and woose-like? Sure ends are tied up from the Talesmaca and the Mayfairs, but the rest is just fluff!!! The book could have been 20 pages and told the story. Seems more like Jackie Collins! Anne, I know you have voluptuous desires, but reeeeaaaly, the finesse that you have shown in the chronicles do not shine in this tell tale....please!"
4,Anne didn't do her research very well for the end.,"While I did enjoy this book, I have to say that I was surprised by the lack of research Anne did here. I will not be giving the ending away now, just know that what she proclaims to be the facts is untrue. It would be opposite of what she would have you believe in this book. Anne has always been good in the past about research and I am just very disappointed about the lack of it here.As a whole, I did enjoy the introduction of Quinn and the return of Mona, with some taste of the Mayfairs. The story had me entertained until the end. Which is why I gave it 4 stars."
1,Desparately Needs an Editor!,"Rambling, random collection of words and images without plot or point. In Rice's first three vampire novels, but particularly in ""Interview..."" one always had the impression that the story was going somewhere...that there was a definite point to the tale. Lately, and most particularly in ""Blackwood Farm"" one realizes that Ms. Rice is being paid by the word, not by the quality of the story. The character's motivations are incomprehensible, their actions random and where characterization exists at all the actions are dissonant with the character's previously stated motives. I wish there were money-back guarantees on Rice novels. I would collect this one."
3,Stick with it!!,"At first I did not like this book at all! Being pampered so much with the stories of Lestat and the regular gang,but if you are a true Vampire Chronicles fan, give this book a chance. Now, it has it's good/bad points. It took me 3 attempts to finsih it--switching from book, to audio, taking a break, and back to book. And it incorporates the mayfair witches a lot more than Merrick, so if you enjoy that, you'll love it--if you don't, please read on, it's still worth it!! Missing this edition would be like leaving a gap in the whole series! Open up, and get to know Quinn, include him in the gang, and you will grow to love him! Stick with this story, and as you will see, it will be well worth your while!!"
2,"What were you thinking, Anne?","I have been a huge fan of the Vampire Chronicles since Interview With the Vampire. As much as I hate to admit it, this book was simply dreadful! The first two chapters were promising, but then the next 3-400 pages plodded along like nails on a chalkboard.The characters were bland and uninspired, and plot dragged at a horribly slow pace. Even the short appearance of Lestat failed to help pick up the pace. Towards the end of the book, I was hoping Lestat would just kill the main character, Quinn, and put us all out of our misery!If you are a big enough fan of Anne Rice's work that you still feel the need to read this disaster, at least save yourself some money and buy it used, or wait for it to come out on paperback."
1,"Ow, ow, ow, stop it, I'm laughing so hard!","Now let me get this straight: starting with Memnoch, Lestat A. Drank the blood of an international drug dealer, B. Went on a psychedelic ""journey"", C. Spent several novels passed out on the floor, and is now D. Going to the country for a wee bit of rest. Great: he's in REHAB and Anne doesn't even know it! Ow, it hurts!O, Lestat, Lestat, Lestat. Do hope you enjoyed the countryside, so peaceful, so restful, so far from the cities, the rush of modern life and from that troublesome--and still pending, I remind you--SCIENCE problem. You know, the one you, Louis and David have all at one time or another wondered out loud about? ""And what if some scientist had gotten hold of me... and I'd been incarcerated, inspected, identified and classified...to the satisfaction of the worst mortal skeptics worldwide,"" wasn't it? It can still happen, you know.So do, do enjoy your pastoral vacation. I'll be here waiting when you get back."
1,Blackwood Farm,"I fell in love with the Witching Hour and the Mayfair witches. Since I found several books that followed rather disappointing, I thought I had another winner with Blackwood Farm. Quite frankly, I thought the ending was the only part of the book worth reading, and I won't be buying any more Anne Rice novels."
1,"Too many misses and not enough hits. Rice strike out, again.","With the possible exception of ""Merrick"", ""Blackwood Farm"" is perhaps the worst book Rice has written in years. Just when I thought I had seen the last of the excruciatingly boring Mayfair clan, they reappear in this cast of new duds, the Blackwoods. Most notably, one Tarquin Blackwood and the idiotic ""Goblin"". Quinn is the most inane caricature of a teenager ever written. Anne needs to take some lessons from Greg Berlanti if she hopes to bring this type of protagonist to life. She has failed miserably and only succeeds in irritating the reader beyond words. How the character Lestat could become interested in Quinn is beyond reason. He should have saved the world the misery of this book by offing the fledgling Quinn at the outset."
4,FINALLY A NEW STORY FROM ANNE RICE,"Some of these reviews are unfair. I've read everything Anne Rice has written and will readily admit that many of latest books were boring regurgitated junk that we already knew.This book however is unique & fresh. A new and interesting story, with well developed interesting characters. If you liked the witching hour - you will like this book! If you loved Anne Rice when she was at her best - she's back! It's a very entertaining read!"
1,Stick a fork in it; it's done,"This book is just another one that should never have existed. There is mention of thing, but they are never explored. There's another vampire-who-is-just-like-all-the-rest named Quinn. At this point, a series that was once so amazing is ruined. Blackwood Farm is beating the dead horse beyond recognition.Rice also tries to mesh her worlds again. Mona Mayfair is mentioned as a vampire, and Merrick comes in and dies (YAY!). The meshing is horrible. This is by far the lowest point in the series so far. Maybe she'll stop.The only good thing that happened was Merrick dying."
4,An interesting look at how money gets distributed in the US.,"Andrew Hacker's Money is a great look at who has the money in America and how they got it. He talks in great detail about how the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. I was astounded to read that in 1997 there were 137 individuals who claimed over $1 billion in income. Almost 70,000 tax returns claimed an income of at least $1 million. There are far more rich people out there than I thought and it leads me to believe that if they can do it, so can I."
3,Fun Sex Stories,"I've looked at Blue Moon Books and Nexus Books and have found I prefer Nexus to the Blue Moon.""Captive"" is pornography, but it's has pure sexual fun as its mission and it worked for me. The Hero, Aisla, is tasked to rescue Sultea from a ""convent"" where dyke women torment the inmates. She succeeds and then these lovers go on a quest through a fantasy world trying to return home safely.On their way they are exploited, raped, buggered, beaten and abused. But, they enjoy the degradation and shame and manage to have many, many orgasims.If you like fantasy settings and raw sex, it's fun. It's not for everyone, but compared to other books aka Penthouse Letters it's more than just a book to masturbate with.I liked it and plan to buy more of Aishling Morgan's books."
2,Pearl Anyone?,"I love Youngblood loose mineral powder foundation and have always wanted a pressed version, as it would be much less messy and much easier to transport, but the only Youngblood shade that matches my skin, pearl, is not available in the pressed form. I really wish they would create this for us pale people."
1,Not Good,"I was very disappointed in this product. After an hour, my face is oily and the foundation begins to separate and look terrible. I will stick with the loose minerals, as they don't contain all of the binder and additives that cause the makeup to look awful so quickly."
4,basis of ailey technique,"i was first introduced to Lester Horton thru a former dancer of his, Ron Brown who taught Horton technique in his modern dance class here at UCLA ... he was phenominal at this stuffShort of having those rare people who can teach you Horton technique personally, this video is the next best thing ... very well done and to the point with a little background on Lester Horton himselfI give it four rather than five stars because i think they should have added some clips of Horton dancers and Ailey dancers in action so that the viewer can see the end result of sticking with these routinesI agree with the previous reviewer that it is very dancer oriented, whereas something like Pilates (even though originally intended for dancers can be easily adpated for fitness enthusiasts)Horton technique though can definitely benefit non-dancers and is a great complement to pilates or yoga"
5,Great Read!,"I read this over a Christmas break from college, and found it to be a very interesting and informative read. While some of the history was slightly off, the information about fiber crafts was very interesting and presented in an entertaining way. Never dry or boring, only slightly repetitive once in a while."
3,Black Frames for Hanging Files,"Was afraid to purchase the frames without sides...thought they would be too flimsy. Purchased 4 of the Black File Frames and they arrived quickly, packaged very well and do exactly what I need...make my hanging file folders & fit; into a box that's too big. These Frames are very sturdy and easy to assemble, but only holds @10 files. Would love for them to hold a few more files. A lot of wasted space. Hopes this helps."
2,Not much more than a reference book,"I strongly agree with T.R. Phillips from Netherlands - although well researched, this book reads like a term paper. No depth or passion. Even the technical details, something an engineer like myself savors, are presented in a dry, dull manner."
1,Not as Described,"The cartridges that I received do not contain the color ink I expected, nor is the packaging as pictured. I received ""Serenity Blue"" erasable ink (Waterman) rather than the standard blue Waterman ink that is indicated in the photo. I've returned the product to TCP Global and hope to receive a full refund, although there was an additional cost to me to return the cartridges."
4,Good Quality,"Good quality pen for a workhorse fountain pen. I like the color, weighs a bit lighter than I would have liked. I love the nib and the consistent flow of ink. I do hope to purchase a more expensive pen in the near future, but for now this one will do just fine. I learnt how to write with a fountain pen, so this pen is nostalgia more than anything else for me."
5,Awesome Mosquitoes repelling lamp,"At first, my wife was skeptical about this will work, but I insisted. I opened the window and door and lit this lantern up, and waited like 20-25 minutes, closed all windows and doors, then blew off the candle, and it worked like magic. No mosquitos the whole night."
5,amazing product!,"Mosquitoes love me. I can go outside for a couple of minutes in the summer (especially in the evening) and come back inside with multiple mosquito bites. That being said, I absolutely love this product! I have never gotten a single mosquito bite while in the vicinity of this lamp. Within minutes of lighting the candle the mosquitoes are gone. Using this lamp is so much better than having to lather up with sticky, smelly bug repellent. Great product!"
5,little house cookbook,I love the book and it's just what I expected. am trying out the recipes. fast service. I received it in just days. thanks Amazon.
3,Timex 1440 Sports Midsize Analog Watch,This is a nice watch BUT the hour and minute hand are the same color as the background so they are very hard to see. I have to move my arm in several different ways depending on the light in the room just to tell what time it is. I would love this watch if the hands were darker in color.
5,very lucid,"I think this is a very useful book for graduate students in the field of nuclear theory too. While not pedagogical, it outlines very clearly the motivation and reasons for thinking about nuclear physics in the low energy regime in the way we do today. also, some explanations and rules are more concise and practical than in standard textbooks or papers. this book also emphasizes generality wherever possible, which is good for a conceptual understanding. i strongly recommend this book to anyone who wishes to have a broad understanding of the fascinating vista that is low energy QCD."
1,Same - beeps and bad accents,I have the same opinion as the last reviewer. I was very disappointed by the fact that there were no native Italians on the CDs. Also the beeps are pretty annoying.
2,It's just a wakeboard,"I bought this board on June 28th and have been using it a couple times a week. I was able to learn to get up and jump the wake immediatly. It is now August 12 and I am ready to get higher perfomance board. I have experience waterskiing and skateboarding and feel this board was a mistake for me. I do not think that this was the board for someone with atheletic ability and skills.I have tried friends boards and cannot believe how much better they are. Since this board is a beginnners board,it is fine for that. I have already outgrown the board and look forward to passing it on to a beginner. For an extra $100, I believe that I would have had the right board for me.If you are considering this board and price is the only thing you care about, then give it a try. If you are looking to learn the sport and have a good time with a board that will grow with you, then look elsewhere."
4,Battery powered - can't turn on while plugged in,"The writeup is not clear, but this is a battery operated light. It has a 110 volt charger and a car charger but the light can not go on while it is plugged into a charger. If it could go on while it was charging I would be happier and give it 5 stars."
2,cheap,I had to get 3 from the seller because each one was broke it was broke clips and battery problems even now the thing will not hold a charge more that 12 hours makeing in bad to take on the road even if ou bring the cable to charge in car takes hours to charge just to die soon after I will never by from MIT again do your self a favor and spend a extra 20 and get a good one.
1,nt good,"i bought this book a few years ago and began reading it as soon as i got home. i got eally bored with it, really fast. i stopped reading it about half-way through, and have not picked it back up since.this guy became an informant long before he could have done anything for the HA that you would find interesting to read about.dont buy."
1,"Because there is no ""zero stars"" option.","The author and the informant put a lot of self love into this garbage book. Just... terrible. Tait (the informant) wanted to play secret agent, but lacked the discipline to be an actual law enforcement agent; so he turned rat. Lavigne (the author) wanted to write fiction, but lacked the imagination. Thus a partnership of convenience was born. Their lovechild was this tripe."
1,Absolutely awful!!,"I have never taken so long to read a book in my life! Boring, boring, boring! Even if you skip the many pages of legal mumbo jumbo, you still have to read Tony Tait's constant whining and moaning sections. I can't believe this author even wrote about this guy! Generally, I find the subject of Hells Angels to be entertaining but this book was an exception to the rule. Anthony Tait manages to make Hells Angels seem totally boring but if the truth be told, Anthony Tait is the most boring subject I've ever read about."
3,Great book to learn from...,"...but the binding is by far the worse that I have ever seen. When I ordered this NEW from Amazon, the spine was already creased, which I didn't think it was going to be a big deal.Three homework assignments later, the pages before Chap. 7 had already started to separate from the spine (where the creases were located when I first received the book). I never had a problem with books falling apart, and I always take good care of them. However, this book couldn't even last a single month of use, which is very disappointing since the semester isn't even close to being over yet."
1,why my book's coverpage has so many scratches,"I don't know why my book coverpage has some damages. The front page was rived. The side of books has so many scratchs, It is a new condition book? That is a joke! The book condition just looks like good not new. I don;t know why looks like old book sold as new."
2,Book fell apart within 3 months,"This review is not about the content of the book, which was excellent. It is about the quality of the physical book. The book was shipped in excellent condition, although it was a softcover with black and white ink. The book started falling apart within 2-3 months of normal course use and by the end of the semester, pages were literally falling out of the book. I have never had this problem with any textbooks in either undergrad or grad school. And, I have used both hardcover and softcover textbooks before. Very disappointing purchase."
2,Too slow and insipid - oft seen story,"The documentary talks about big corporation and pollution issues around vinyl - but the narrative is too slow and seems too familiar, with many of us having seen the similar issues addressed in other documentaries."
2,Cheap and Ugly,"These looked much better in the picture. Not only did they only send me ONE bookend instead of TWO, but they were much less elegant than in photo and just looked very cheap in my opinion.NEXT:/"
3,its good and bad,"I gave Evil Empire 3 stars not because it was only average but because it didnt live up the self titled rage album. By itself this is a strong album yet i found it to be a letdown compared to their first c.d. Lyrically Evil Empire was outstanding. It had more of a hip hop feel to it which I enjoyed. However, musically the songs seemed to be simplified compared to the first c.d. and not as entertaining. Rage is at their best when alternating between rap and hard rock. They did this to perfection on the first c.d. but on Evil Empire seemed to focus more on laying down a steady beat for De La Rocha to rap to as oppossed to experimenting with a variety of guitar solos or varying tempos. Nevertheless, the album is still quite good. De La Rocha shines especially on tracks like ""People of the Sun"" and ""Without a Face"". Only bye this c.d. if youre a true Rage fan."
4,Their best release,"Rage followed up a relatively naive debut with a furious, lean, mean, ROCK record that didn't get the credit that it deserves. It by no means has the hooks that the first one has, but the songs sound better and therefore hit harder than they did on the debut. For the release afterwards, Rage lost the energy and punch that they had on this album, and went back to a more produced-sounding rock-rap-funk hybrid. On this album, though, their influences melded together into fluid and organic ""live"" rock sound that they never achieved again. This is their noisiest and most sonically interesting record - and it rocks the hardest. Be warned though: there aren't really any pop hits here. If their first album hadn't made them stars they would have remained in the underground with Evil Empire. That's where they should have been the whole time."
4,Great Follow-up,"This CD isn't as good as the first one but really it couldn't have been and everyone knows that. It is however really good and comes close to achieving what the first one did. Songs like Bulls On Parade, Down Rodeo, and People of the Sun are classics in their own right and showed that Rage could do it at least one more time."
3,"Good one, but not great.","RATM's second album is a very good effort actually, but it lack's that sort of consistent sound on their previous release. Sure, the first two tracks will blow your head off because Bulls On Parade and People of The Sun are such intense and powerfull. Vietnow is very good two, but the rest of the album lack's something, i don't know, maybe is the bass slaping. Morello's solos are a little bit ""simplier"" than earlier ones...However, the lyrics remain consistently political and self-explanatory, it's just that the music this time wasn't so attractive."
1,rage against rage against the machine,"this is the debut album with different lyrics. this album is so half-hearted, it's hard to believe they're actually all that angry at all. they should stop raging for a few days and use the time to write some new material."
1,There is no zero stars,"I don't even think this junk can be classified as Rap/Rock/Metal. You think that just because you add some guitars and drums that it will be considered rap/rock? There's not even any SINGING in it. I will have to give some credit to the instrument use, but other than that, it's terrible. All of their songs sound the same on ALL of their CDs. What we see here is an older version of the Beastie Boys. If you want rap/rock, buy Chronic Future."
4,"good left-wing lyrics, good vocals, great guitar & drums!","I say this is about equal to the 1st album. The lyrics show that these guys truly are quite politically aware ... which is a refreshing change from the apolitical, meaningless, and bland essence of most modern pop music. The music rocks hard, and Tom Morrello produces a variety of cool, unorthodox sounds from his guitar. Bulls on Parade is Great, as is People of the Sun. Get this album and live dangerously. Can't wait till the third album comes out!"
4,Great cd but Battle of Los Angeles is better!!,I like Battle of Los Angeles better! Lemme tell you that that is the best cd ever and I do recommend you pre-order it or you will be missing out!
3,"Their weakest, most unfocused to date, still a few good trax","This album was a big letdown for me when it came out...I thought that after about four years, they would have had some time to create some new, great songs, but there are only about 4 or 5 on this album that I ""needed"" to hear over and over...although I do feel the drums and bass are pretty good, and Tom Morello continues to do his thing all too well, Zack's lyrics did not speak to me nearly as much as the debut album's did. Not a neccessary buy unless you are a die-hard Rage fan."
1,"Repetitive, Uninspiring, & Disappointing","""People of the Sun"" hit the airwaves, piquing our interest with political lyrics, its hard-edge bass and Zack de la Rocha's yelling. Unfortunately, the rest of the album is day-old hash, a repetitive, mushy mixture of sounds. De la Rocha's yelling is monotonous, and if you make it through the fourth song without pressing fast-forward you're a masochist. Rage ought to study 311's self-titled or Nirvana's Nevermind for albums that have variety and still get the listener pumped."
1,""" I went to Harvard"" - who cares","After a stunning effort on their self titled album, I was the first in line at the record store when Evil Empire came out. I threw this thing in my CD player and drove down the road, expecting to listen to the whole thing on my drive from San Diego to Los Angeles. I was hugely disappointed by this release. I felt Rage had completely lost the edge they had on their first effort. Even more sad is the hype this album gets by everyone including my roomates. Geez. Zack has spent the majority of his music career building songs based around the same structure, start the song really angry, yell for about two minutes, slow it down for about 45 seconds (this is the part where he explains to everyone why he's so upset) and then start yelling again. It gets boring, but apparently just to me. Every album that followed this one is exactly the same. Can't believe I'm alone in feeling this way."
1,Give me a break!,"Absolute crap! No talent whatsoever and stupid lyrics. But hey, a lot of people I know seem to like this album. Oh well."
3,Rage on parade.,"This is a disc I didn't get right away because I thought the cover art blew. Well, it still does, but you can't judge a CD by its cover I guess. This is a decent follow-up to their much better debut. There are a few songs here that are among their very best, but as a whole, the album is simply good. The stand-outs are obviously the singles ""Bulls On Parade"" and ""Down Rodeo"". I like alot of the other songs such as ""People Of The Sun"" and ""Vietnow"", but those other two are the only ones that approach the punch of a song like ""Bombtrack"". Overall I like this enough to keep it, but most casual fans or newcomers should just get the first album. I also think they need a ""Hits"" disc."
4,the debut is better,"this cd has really good songs, but it does not have the raw feeling of the first album, this cd is a little more heavy than the debut, great songs: people of the sun, bulls on parade, vietnow, revolver and down rodeo, this cd is worth buying but i personally would get their third cd or the first if i was new to rage against the machine, my favorite one is the first cd."
1,Pathetic at best,"Typical rap-metal - if you've heard one song by this group, then you've heard them all, and they all suck, just like Korn and Limp Bizkit. This group shows no musicianship, just like most people involved in rap in any way, shape or form. They're just a bunch of wussies trying to look and sound tough. If they want to make a political statement, then they should just run for public office and spare us this sorry excuse for music."
4,Where are our myths?,"Not really a history so much as an essay on the significance of myth and its role in human society and psyche. As is typical with much of Karen Armstrong's work, she shines best when writing about Western religious traditions; the bits on Eastern religions and philosophies seem almost perfunctory. This would make a good book for a discussion group as it raises a number of interesting questions (and at 150+ pages it is not hugely demanding). Armstrong notes the necessity of myth for both individual and social sustenance, and laments its disappearance from contemporary capitalist society. But as the new world order shows no signs of imminent collapse, is Armstrong's thesis correct? Is myth indeed necessary? Or, is there perhaps a mythology that we can't yet see, a forest for the trees?"
2,OK,"I watched this movie today, and it was not as bad as I was expecting it to be. A treasure map being on the back of the declaration of independence just seems like a silly idea. It was done surprisingly well, though. The ideas seemed almost credible except for the obviously over-done special effects. The clues found on the back of the declaration seemed like something that a druggie during a period of withdrawal would see. I won't say anymore. Worth watching once, but no more."
1,Disappointing!,Not a bad story line but Nick Cage was a poor choice for the lead. He just doesn't fit. A better movie is Sahara with Matthew McConaughey. Same treasure seeking-saving the girl kind of story line with a much better & more believable leading action man.
5,In love!,This is one of my favorite Nicolas Cage movies and I was waiting for a real good deal to buy it....and I found it!! Love this movie!!
5,HOW CAN YOU NOTE LOVE NICOLAS CAGE,"Extrememly delightful movie. As always with Mr. Cage, a little romance, a little action and even a little history. Very entertaining."
4,Very good!,"This is a very good dvd overall. I like this dvd because it has some funny moments,history, and action. I have seen this movie eleven times and I still love it! The only problem I have with this movie is the factthat Ben Gates {Nicholas Cage} gets away with stealing the Declaration ofIndependence without getting punished. Overall though this is a very good dvd and worth buying."
3,Nick the Treasure Hunter,"I am not exactly a history buff, but I found National Treasure to be moderately enjoyable. The clues incorporated into famous landmarks add some interest. The only thing I cannot stand is Nicholas Cage's monotone voice. He's not exactly a sexy action hero, and his acting doesnt exactly blow me over, but this role does not require much anyway. Also, there is NO chemistry between Nicholas and Diane Kruger so their romance seems a little forced. Anyhow, this movie did not put me to sleep and (GASP!) I may have actually learned something."
5,...,"man i really wish jahn cusack was in this movie. I really wanted another nude seen with him after seeing his wee muscled butt in highlander. oh well, that's life..."
3,"Begins Great, Pace Slows to a Halt","With a mindblowing opening, National Treasure starts off well, and gradually turns from an enjoyable heist thriller to a grueling, slow-paced treausure hunt. After the first thirty minutes, the film becomes dull and uninteresting. The acting- especially on the part of Cage- is top-notch, which is a shame- the entire film is almost a waste of his effort. People like him could be superstars if they appeared in the right films. However, the lacking NATIONAL TREASURE will certainly not earn him the respect as an actor he deserves."
4,Fun Adventure for Family,"National Treasure could be compared to other adventure films and similarities could be drawn. Doing so doesn't draw away from the fun adventure that you and your family will encounter while watching this film.Sit back and enjoy the mythical elements of an accumulated treasure right here in our own country. With knights, freemasons, and historical characters all protecting it with their very lives.Join Ben Gates as he uncovers clue after clue in an amazing combination of secrecy and evil as he's pursued by those who want to exploit the treasure as their own. Cheer for Ben as he figures out the clues only to find his way blocked by the FBI and his enemies.With friends at his side, Ben Gates discovers what no one else in over 200 years had been able to figure out. Watch his triumph. Celebrate with him. Be happy for him.This is a movie that you can watch with your family, from young to old. Disney produced it."
4,A Fun Ride,Borrowed this from a friend. Had a great time watching it. It's a good old fashion mystery/action film. One of best things I've seen Cage in.
4,Little Difference,I found little to no difference in the quality of this blu-ray compared to the DVD which I also own. I really liked this story and I was curious as to what 'enhancement' blu-ray would provide.... I'm not impressed.
5,An Awsome Movie!!,I like this movie because it was vary cool and exciting. I was like popping out of my chair waiting for the next thing to happen. It was so awsome. I hope i get it when it comes out. I would love to have it on dvd. If you havent seen it yet... you should rent it or even buy it. This will be a movie you wont forget!!
2,Not good!,While I am a Nicholas Cage fan this is definitely not one of his finer works. The plot is not only not believable but also not enough to keep you interested in the movie. This was definitely a Indiana Jones wanna be that did not have it.
3,Roller Coaster Film Not Enough Hype,"It shall been alot better plot and acting whise but it wasn't fall it fall short some major area, Perhaps was the main characer wasn't the right role. Is not quite a disney film u know before a very different approach, not enought detailst o back some plot see it yours if u curious, suggest for a rent but might be a whise to purshase."
2,Lamest ever,"People keep saying that the moving is contrived, etc. Let's just use the appropriate words. It is dumb. It makes dumb and dumber look smart.I suppose it is clean fun for those under thirteen, but why subject them to this when there are great movies that they can also see.Avoidance is best."
1,so bad,"This movie is in a word awful. The dialouge is absolutely terrible. The ""history"" if you can call it that is pretty shakey. Nicholas Cage has played the same charecter for the past five years. Towards the end of the movie they seem to realize that they forgot to add a love story into the plot. So they have Cage kiss his female lead in one of the most bizarre moments I've seen in awhile. Honestly if i could have given it less stars i would have. There are far better movies to watch with your time than this drivel."
2,"""Lookee what he can do!""","Over the top action sequences, dumb story, lame dialogue, and bad acting make this, a national piece of S#it."
5,NATIONAL TREASURE,I LOVE JUST ABOUT ANYTHING NICOLAS CAGE STARS IN...HE CAN BE FUNNY WITH OUT EVEN TRYING. I LIKE THE STORY LINE AND THE WAY THE MOVIE ENDED. IT HAS A GREAT CAST AND YOU JUST GET LOST IN THE ACTION...
4,Surprisingly Good,Going into the theaters to watch this movie I expected some half hearted attempt to make money kind of movie. But surprisingly this movie was beyond any expectation. Nicholas Cage did an excellent job of acting along with the rest of the cast. A well written script and good directing made this movie a find. A good buddy movie.
5,About National Treasure DVD,I love this movie and am very happy that I recieved it as quickly as I did after ordering.
4,Gives you exactly what it promises,"I think when watching a movie you have to tailor your expectations to what the makers were trying to do with their film. With that in mind National Treasure delivers: a broad, completely ridiculous plot, a hero you can root for, a villain wtih unlimited resources who will stop at nothing to achieve his ends, wild over-the-top action scenes and a little romance and comic relief thrown in with the kitchen sink. There is enough history that we all know to keep you interested in the story until they throw history at you that you didn't know which provides the ultimate twist and turns. I've read complaints about the acting but I didn't see a problem with it. This was never meant to be Shakespeare so just pop the DVD back in and have some fun."
5,AWESOME Movie!,My whole family LOVES this movie. What a great story. An educational and thrilling ride all the way through. Definitely worth seeing and buying!
2,more hollywood muck,"indiana jones has been made. it came out 20 years ago, and was a hit. two sequels of excellent quality followed. why is it that hollywood cant let things go? how many times must there be an attempt to place indiana jones in a different locale, different era, with a different cast? and this, by far, is one of the longest leaps hollywood has made in the ""stick-to-the-crap-that-has-worked-before"" plan. nicholas cage. he could have had a great career. everything was looking so good, then his complete obsession with elvis somehow took over. mr cage you are NOT elvis presley. stop with the collared shirts. youre also balding, so when they throw a toupee on you in every film, everyone kinda chuckles. the storyline to this film is ludicrous at best, and barely researched. yes there are some neat-o things, but i got a bigger thrill from reading angels and demons from dan brown. its a silly movie. entertaining, but silly."
3,Okay,My daughter started watching this in school and wanted the movie at home so she could finish it. She wasn't impressed.
2,Is it over yet?,"I have one word - BORING. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the characters were likeable and the heroine was very well-written. Unfortunately, these great characters' story was just too bland and lackluster. I was huffing and puffing like a child and checking to see how many pages were left. Thoroughly unsatisfying. I'm grateful I got it for free as part of a promotion."
4,A sweet diversion,"Obviously written before she got into the Cynster groove, this is not the Laurens that many of us have become used to. Don't dismiss it out of hand, it's a sweet tale. It just really doesn't ""go anywhere"" , it's more of a character study. I'd recommend it for those who find the Cynster books a bit too steamy, but otherwise - skip it and read her new stuff."
5,I love this book,"Excellent reading, highly recommended. Something you can go back to again and again."
5,Best book I've read,I have read this book many times - in the middle of reading it yet again. Whenever I feel my life is controlling me instead of me controlling my own life I pick up this book and read it again. It gives me the positive inspiration that I need every time I read it.
1,Not as described,Bowl does not hold 18 oz...........measures 16 oz exactly. Matches other dishes good for dessert not cereal.
2,What is unique is not useful,"I've never been so disappointed in an Amazon purchase, and yes, I'm returning it. Most of the book is excerpts from congressional testimony (hearings from back in 1999, and available on the web) and the remainder, sadly, is touchy-feely junk. He added no technical information, and nothing about how to protect electronic possessions. Actually, if you liked the long-winded review posted before mine, which I skimmed over with a ""blah, blah, blah"", maybe you would like the addition - it also skimmed as ""blah, blah, blah"". But, for something that claims to add some updated information - no soap."
5,Kind of Heart,"Each chapter is a short story of life as lived in the 1950's by me, the author. It is a book that will bring tears, laughter, and warmth into the heart of the reader as stories of our family's love for one another unfold during a time that is gone forever. I have put together this book from columns I wrote for the Mustang News for three years beginning in 1993. The book is the result of patrons' request after the columns ceased. My hope was to instill in all readers--both old and young--the memories I have of a time when family values were top priority, and a dream that one day, they might be like that again. I hope the book will cause you to celebrate life, families, and God. --Molly Lemmons"
4,love the shoes,"they fit and feel better than the other rebel shoes with the star on it. the strap is kind of annoying if you need to take off the shoes alot, but other than that, they are super cute! i can wear a plain shirt or a nice one... it matches with greys, blacks, watever! best investment on shoes i've ever made."
5,Incredible Performances,"I have several versions of the Beethoven Late Quartets including the Alban Berg and Guarneri sets. The Lindsays are the ones I keep playing however. Their interpretations bring extra depth to these profound works. These works require repeated listenings so that one can begin to hear and grasp the sublime wonders that lie within. The Lindsays help illuminate the road to discovery, as they seem to understand all the nuances. The natural tempos, the conversations amongst the players and the musicality that is inherent in each phrase make for a rewarding experience. Highly recommended!"
3,pool,"My daughter had been asking for this toy for weeks. It's a regular toy with no specific advantages or disadvantages. Even though it's just a pretend pool, it was wonderful for imaginary play. My daughter just loved it. (it is a bit messy though) Overall a fun purchase."
1,Not worth it!,The stairs on the side of the pool is the only thing that holds the pool up and there is no way to attach it. It is held in place by a small ledge on the side of the stairs and does not attach. If you even touch this pool set it falls down. I also have seen this pool set in the store for $[...] less. I would not purchase this inusable set!
5,Delightful reading with a great aftertaste,"Andre Auw is a gifted writer and counselor. I found the thematic chapters a mosaic of simple but profound practical wisdom with gentle nudges towards personal healing. The book is easy to read with a great aftertaste. As a counselor of many years, I found the book not only inspiring but delightful - a great gift."
3,"Kids may like it, but...","I remember back in November of 2003 when Cartoon Network first aired this movie, and being an animation junkie I could'nt wait to see it. However, years later after watching this movie I have learned that it is quite terriable!Don't get me wrong, the story is original and cute and it could of made a great movie if it was animated a little better and maybe have some more effort put into the artwork. Being an artist my self I'm really picky about quality animation. I don't judge art either, but I can tell when someone doen't even try and the artist were just lazy when creating this film, and again the animation is quite sloppy. The songs featured in the film are a bit cheezy but tolerable and sometimes the story can get weird and confusing for young ones. Nevertheless kids who like dogs and animal animation will like it, adults will problemly not give it the time of day."
1,bad product,"We normally like Safety 1st products, but this one is terrible. Our son likes to slam doors, so we bought this to keep him from taking his fingers off while we worked to train him to leave the doors alone. He managed to break both guards. They are soft and squishy, so he had fun bouncing the door against the jam (wrong message), and when he slammed the door hard enough they fell off or ripped. We've had much better luck with the harder ones that stay put, aren't cute or fun, and keep him from damaging himself or the house."
2,Bad Deal,"The silicone earbuds slip off the earphones easily (and there are reports of the silicone cuff pulling off the earphone and wedging inside the ear canal requiring medical attention). Jostling in a bag is enough to disloge and LOOSE them. I lost one side within a month of purchase. The other sizes don't work well but I used the smaller set for a few months. Ditto on loosing one side . Amazon and Sony do not offer replacements. Other companies sell replacements but they are extremely expensive (~$10 + $7 s/h). Instead, I spent $2 more and bought a new headphone set. This product design is really about forcing consumers to spend spend spend rather than enjoying any lasting value in the product."
4,Great Value for Good Quality,I am enjoying these headphones and find them a very good value for the price. I read previous reviews and agree with one comment about why the left bud is attached in a shortened fashion to the longer right bud - just a bit awkward at times. I would recommend this product and would buy it again if I need a replacement.
2,I don't get the hype,"I purchased a set of these from Amazon based on all of the sterling reviews and after using and subsequently returning them I can only surmise that Apple's earbuds (which most reviewers replaced with these) must be horrendous. I was utterly shocked at the tinny Am transistor radio sound that these produced. The earbuds that came with my Sandisk Sansa player were infinitely better, though they broke very quickly. After returning these I tried many others and was very pleased with the sound, price and comfort of the Phillips surround sound earphones (14.OO) at Walmart. I then tried the Maximo earphones after reading the reviews on Amazon. The sound of these is phenomenal for the same price as the Sony'. I ended up keeping both pairs because the Phillips were so comfortable and the Maximo produced such wonderful sound, though the Phillips sound is quite respectable and I would have been happy with them if I had not tried the Maximos"
1,"No bass at all, sound too shrill and treble heavy, would not recommend it at all!","I bought these on the strength of the Sony brand but am very disappointed with the quality of the product. The sound from these headphones have no bass at all, is too heavy on the treble and it sounds like it's been played in a very acoustic unfriendly room. I tried to change the equalizer settings on my iPod to see if the sound improves but I just couldn't stand it! I am surprised that the reviews for this product are not representative of the actual quality of the product. Doesn't happen too many times on Amazon. Just printed out the return mailing label from Amazon. These headphones will be out of my messenger bag and on its way back by the end of this week."
2,I hated these,I am a med student and we listen to our lectures online after class is over... these things were good for the first 2 months and then they started falling apart. The part near the ear starts pealing off and exposing the wires. Many of my friends had to get replacements as well since many had these. Becareful.
2,Weaker bass than Apple's standard earbuds,"While the headphones are very cool looking and fit so well you forget about them, they suffer in sound quality. When I first tried them, I was surprised at how tinny and treble heavy they sounded. Wondering if I was just used to my stereo speakers, I popped on my standard Apple headphone. Bam - the bass was back. I'd imagine they'd be good for running as they do fit snugly, but buyer beware. Cool looks, comfortable fit but not so good sound quality."
1,Weak construction,"The phone sound fine to me. The isolation is medicore compare to IEMs. The problem of this earbud is that the wire is sticky and thin. The result is the ruber that surround the wire splited open after about 4 months of usage with the fact that I store if in a box while I'm not using it. So if one wants to buy this, need to buy some extra warranty since the phone is so fragile."
3,Not really that pink,"Certainly fit better and are more comfortable than the standard-issue iPod headphones, but as a long-time user of studio reference headphones (the kind you'd look stupid riding the subway in), I can say that the quality of these are pretty average.The only thing I don't think has been mentioned by other reviewers is that it's not really pink. The photo shows this and, if anything, even exaggerates its coloring. I was really looking for something a little more colorful than these for the extra $5 or whatever it is more than the white MDR-EX51LP. (Some might say the subtle metallic tint is classier, but I think the look is pretty over)."
2,Weak design,After two monts I can toss them away. Due to a poor design cable coming from one of the ear piece was torn.Sound is average.I would not recommed you to buy them.
1,Headhpones,"The left earbud of the first pair of earbuds I received was dead. When I received the second pair ( Amazon return policy was fantastic ) the sound quality was dismal, yet something I could deal with as they were for the express purpose of usage during exercise. The method of retaining the earbuds near the ear though was very uncomfortable regardless of which size of foam shell I used. Disregarding the previous point the earbuds tend to become dislodged and eventually removed from my ear during regular walking which severely limits their usage for the initially expressed purpose."
4,"Good Sound Quality, but...","I bought these Ear Headphones primarily to use when running and biking at the club. The sound quality is acceptable, not exceptional. The construction is a little flimsy and the big issue is that the cord is shorter for the left ear than the right. That places all the force on the left side and that one tends to pull out. I have no idea why Sony thought that this was a good design. For the money they could also have included a case rather than a clip for the cord. I would give these a B- good/not great."
2,Banging transfers through cord!,"The sound quality and comfort are fine, but you can hear a loud thumping through the cord as it bounces on your body during a workout! Very odd. I have other headphones and have never had this problem before."
1,Terrible Sound!,These headphones sound WORSE than the one's that came with my Ipod touch. There is no low frequency response. Turn the volume up and you have piercing high frequency only. I regret purchasing these headphones
2,Good sound... breaking after 3 months!,I like these headphones... but the right side has begun to short out after just 3 months of use.I will look elsewhere next time.
4,Great headphones!,"I ordered these because regular earbud-type headphones always fall out of my ears and begin to hurt a lot after only 10-15 minutes. These headphones are great, especially because they come with three different size cups that fit in your ears (I have to use the smallest ones). You shouldn't buy these if you are primarily concerned with noise isolation (why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5), since they don't isolate all the noise. Having said that, though, I prefer to hear things around me when I'm listening to music, so the fact that I can hear the music much, much better than I ever have before with headphones on AND I can hear things going on around me (though quite muted) is a bonus for me."
5,Best Peeler Ever!,"I don't write many reviews, but I've been moved to share the fantastic performance of this little tool. I love roasted butternut squash. I have never found it so easy to peel before. I can't say enough great things about this peeler."
5,great vegetable peeler,"It seemed like it took forever for the Oxo Good Grips I-series peeler to come in - over a week past the expected delivery date. The peeler came in such a large box, too. But, that's not what this review is about! I love this peeler. It's really comfortable to use, it's sharp, and it does a remarkable job. I highly recommend it."
5,Highly original and accessible,"I found this book to be a real page-turner, especially for a work of non-fiction. Westerfield's research is meticulous, but her style is compelling and unpretentious.I sought the text out because of my interest in the often untold history of World War II, particularly in regard to women's roles, and I have not found anything comparably substantive and accessible in my many years of personal and scholastic research on the subject.I could see this text being a success commercially as well as in the academic realm; I will use it for a course next year and recommend it highly."
1,This was evil bad,"Impossibly campy acting, terrible production values, some of the worst fight scenes ever, incoherence. Really, it old be this generations Plan 9 from Outer Space."
4,"action, acting ok, good to add to your library of movies if you are a movie collector, like myself...this was a gift for my son.","I enjoyed this movie it was ok, someone brought it for me and in return i brought it for my son to add to his collection. He says he enjoyed the movie and he had never heard of this movie. I like that fact that I got it at a great price. So thanks AMAZON!!!!!!!!"
1,How to punish someone..,"Exceptionally poor acting, gratuitous profanity, make this movie unwatchable.At least this is true for the first 30 min, since I could not stand it, and stopped watching."
5,Good basic template,"Sturdy, hard transparent plastic, good variety of rectangles with rounded edges, 3 holes so fits in binder. Made for use with Fiskars cutter, but I often use without."
1,didn't stand a chance,"Unfortunately, by the time this book made it to my house it was completely worthless. I needed it to write a paper for college, but after it took a week and a half to get to my house, ironically it came the same day as the paper was due and I failed the class. It was my fault for waiting so long to order it, but I had looked everywhere else, plus where on earth did it ship from that it took that long. I will NEVER go through Amazon.com again.p.s. the book is still in its packaging since their was no use in opening it"
5,One of the Only Books to go Make you See a Movie,"I have been a film fan but never saw the depth of what a film can be. I saw through this book on the joy of films regardless of genre, language, style, and age which i began to express. I began to see movies from the classics on tcm and independent films on ifc. I saw this book not as essay' but a joy in the films. You can notice that Ebert wanted to write more than the five page limit and not these movies are the offically best but his personal view on films he loves. The great thing is that you cant wait for another book about more films that he loves. I began to watch these movies from his book more out of curiosity, not of being a film buff. I loved them and still going on. From appreciating foreign films to the classics this book told me that a film is just a experiance that makes you feel joy. A must have for film enthusiastics who want to explore more in the movies."
1,Babies come from hospitals ???????,"I recently bought this book for my 3 year old based on the reviews here. True, I found the pictures very cute, BUT this book is not at all helpful if you are looking to provide answers to your child. Thanks, but I'd rather not confuse my son further by teaching him that ""babies come from hospitals""."
5,Excellent story!,"I absolutly love this story! If anyone has a copy of this book or cassette, I am willing to pay a very good price to own this story - Please respond to flynnkate@hotmail.com Thank You!"
1,Not Loretta's Best,"Thank goodness this wasn't the first Loretta Chase novel I read otherwise I would never pickup another one! I just recently discovered Loretta Chase and was thrilled to find her after reading ""Not Quite a Lady"" and ""Mr. Perfect"". I couldn't believe this was written by the same author! Not only was it missing the elements I loved about her other books (witty dialog, likable characters), but it spent way too much time on the mystery of the husband's killer. The heroine was far too emotional and prone to extreme tantrums. She was pathetic in her obsession with Comte D'Esmond, a man you never really got to know or like. I also agree with another reviewer that there was too much time spent on homosexual behavior. We get enough of this on TV and movies today, must we have it thrown into the historical romances too?"
5,Intelligent and attractive H and h plus a good mystery,Loved the tough heroine who helps peel the layers from the hero in an atmosphere of sexual/sensual tension while solving a mystery. Very different and more cerebral than most regencies. I thoroughly enjoyed it!
2,Touch of Fate -- Going Back to the Basics of Moviemaking,"In an era when US movie screens are increasingly dominated by male-targeted flicks featuring explosions, violence, and special effects, it is a pleasure to see a US film that focuses on the ""traditional"" basics of film-making: dialogue and character development. This is not a big-budget movie, so don't expect to see lush million-dollar sets and aerial camera tracking shots. However, you may find yourself being moved emotionally by the story of two late thirty-something-year olds whose lives cross paths during a late-night traffic accident. A woman from New York City has come to a small town in North Carolina hoping to join her fiancée, and a stressed-out businessman from Los Angeles has come to visit his elderly mother. After the accident, they get to know each other. As you learn about their family and personal struggles and aspirations, you become engaged in their lives."
1,Not as good as I thought it was going to be...,"I read this book for pleasure, and knowing it had won the Newberry I thought I was going to be throughly delighted with it. I was incredibly dissapointed. The novel, based on the true story of an indian girl who survives on an island alone for 18 years, was slow and tedious, and at times way too ""mushy"", as my brother would say. It has no rapport with young male readers, even though there are some aspects of adventure in the novel. I'm afraid I just didn't like the book at all."
2,Probably taste good but not what I want to feed my baby.,"I bought this book hoping to just have an overview of how to puree different veggies and fruits and which preparations could freeze well. This book had a lot of recipes that looked really tasty, however, most of the recipes added butter and salt which I didn't want to feed my 6 month old. There were a few simple recipes for purees but then most of the recipes were very involved and inpractical for my schedule. I found lots of much easier and healthier recipes for free online. I ended up returning the book."
4,Good recipes.,"When my son turned 4 months, my pediatrician suggested me to cook the baby food myself and recommended me this book. Because I really like my pediatrician, I bought this book without any doubt. All the recipes are interesting and they look really good and nutritious. My son actually likes the food I made with these recipes. It's so tasty, I finish it myself when he can't finish his food. Most of the recipes are fairly easy to make too. It's a plus for me as a working mom. I can make two kinds in one night that lasts for at least a week. However, be mindful with the cheese. There are some recipes that I found are way too salty for a baby because of the amount of cheese added. I thought salt is not recommended for baby less than 1 year old. But overall, I really like this book."
2,2 star for the Kindle Edition,"I have browsed through the book and the recipes in the book are nice, and I am ready to start trying them for my little one. I have bought the Kindle Edition of the book. The version is not good at all. Here are the reasons:1) There is no page number2) There is no table of content.3) Once you follow a link on the page and jump to another page, there is no link to jump back. The issue in 1) makes it a real headache to find the page you were on initially, which makes the link feature unusable.The paper version is $7.95, and Kindle edition is $12.99(shouldn't we be paying less on Kindle edition). I bought it for the convenience, but the no table of contents make it very hard to look for a recipe ... I totally regret my Kindle edition purchase."
3,Ok book but too many basic recipes,"I purchased this book because I wanted more ideas on the baby food I could make for my daughter. Some of the recipes are great, others are very basic - I personally didn't need a cook book to teach me how to boil and puree carrots.Also I found that some of her recommendations are not in line with what my pediatrician recommends. For example I was told by my pediatrician to avoid giving carrots (even organic) because of the high level of nitrates in them, but I find that a lot of her recipes have carrots.The meat and fish recipes were great, it gave me a good starting point to introduce those into my daughter's diet. I wish there were more recipes with beans and lentils.I have used a limited number of recipes in this book but the ones I've used were great, and now I use them as a base and make my own variations."
5,very helpful!,"This is a great book for anyone who wamts to feed their baby the best!It gives wonderful info about when to start which foods. How to make great sounding foods. What can be frozen and for how long. Also, fantasic tips throughout about nutrition."
3,very useful,"this is my first book for baby food, havent tried all recipes...however the few i tried are easy and tasty....my baby likes the new taste and i hope all recipes are equally interesting ..."
4,Good book for making baby food,"The only thing about this book is that the price went down two days after I purchased it. Wish I could get the difference back. Overall, it's easy to read with nice layout and images."
5,Fantastic Recipes!,"My daughter has loved the food I've made for her from the recipes from this book. They are easy, freeze well, and I have fun cooking for her! I highly recommend this book for your child!"
4,Helpful and Easy,This was a very good purchase. This book has great recipes and making your own baby food is easy
1,Not useful,I did not use a single recipe from this book. Better recipes can be found online for free. Dont buy.
4,Where can I pick me up one?,"Another fun read from Sherrilyn Kenyon. All the Men have hearts of gold under rough exteriors and all the women are adored by them. What more could you want? The scenes between the couples are very sexy and very funny! Sure there's a little bondange, but what's a little bondage among friends?"
5,Essential '60s Text,"This extensively researched book shows the birth of a new breed of passive resistance in this country, in front of the backdrop of the 1960s and earlier. An essential text for anyone interested in the 1960s. (Also a great research paper resource . . .)"
3,Better than most online newspapaers I have read.,I subscribe to the Washington Post paper version and get the online version when I travel.. I am pleased by what I see.
4,Washington Post Kindle Edition is Well Organized,I have been reading the WP Kindle edition for approximately 3 weeks and find the articles well organized and written with a reasonable length. It is convenient to receive the edition before 7 AM Pacific Time so I can quickly glance at the top stories before going to work.
3,Narrow minded news coverage,"I am a relative newcomer to the USA, living in Virginia. I was interested in finding a Kindle delivered newspaper that gave me good coverage of international events. I tried the New York Times for a week, and thought it was quite good. Then I switched to the Washington Post to compare news coverage. It was like ""chalk and cheese"". I'll be going back to the New York Times."
3,"Great idea, but not yet glitch-free.","The Kindle version of The Washington Post is easier to navigate than the hard-copy paper. I can easily find everything from the lead stories to the letters to the editor. Nonetheless, the Kindle version has the following deficiencies:1. Limited graphics. I don't miss The WaPo's painfully unfunny funny pages, but why leave out the editorial cartoons?2. Formatting. The articles are full of spacing errors and garbage characters.3. The county-specific Thursday ""Local Living"" section. I live in Virginia (and Amazon knows this), and yet I receive the ""Local Living"" section for Prince George's County, Maryland."
1,Why is it double the cost in Canada?,"Interesting. If I look at the price of a subscription to the Washington Post via the review page, it's only $11.99 a month. However, when I go to get a subscription it is double the price!Is this purely an additional price added by Amazon? Or is there some sort of tariff that I have to pay due to it being a US publication delivered to a Canadian subscriber?"
2,Doesn't always download,"I've had it for about a month, and found that many days do not download until a few days later with several other WP late downloads. If I can't get 'today's news TODAY' then it isn't news! If this continues I am canceling my paid subscription."
3,Post on Kindle is Okay.,"My roommate subscribes to the Washington Post, but it has been taking me all day to read the print version. After seeing that other magazines and journals were cheaper on Kindle (usually $2 on Kindle to the $10 spent at the stand per month), I decided to try the $12 per month Post. Well, as many have commented, there are only the ""important"" stories for the day, and it's missing a lot of the other content that the print version includes. I think I also have to log in to Amazon to have it wirelessly transfered. It doesn't just show up at my doorstep, like the print version. However, I have found that the Kindle version is easier for me to read, which is not the case with all books and other publications. I love that I don't have to worry about the waste or the huge paper I keep lugging around."
3,Missing what makes the paper a paper,"I just got my Kindle over the weekend as a gift and was delighted that I could read the local paper -- the Washington Post-- on it. However, after a few days of trying, I'm pretty confident that I will not be subscribing to the Kindle version of the Post. Why?1) It's not a real replacement for the paper. I miss the letters to the editor, the editorial cartoons, the comics pages, the crossword puzzle et al, and even the box scores so I can check on the hapless Cincinnati Reds.2) While I'm generally delighted not to have any advertising, I do miss the classified ads. Also, sometimes, I do look at the ads if a sale is on.3) No Sunday inserts, including coupons!4) No pictures whatsoever. Sure, pictures are high-bandwidth, but they are an important part of how we communicate information.5) Price. The paper is more expensive than a home delivery but is missing all the features I list above...."
3,"Good, but needs more content from the paper","This is a pretty good improvement over the online version of the paper in some aspects, but not others. They really only need to fix a couple issues to make this a really good subscription. This is not a Kindle issue: it is a Washington Post issue.One, there is no weather included. Why not?Two, there are no sports statistics. Why not?Three, there is little in the line of things like movie or DVD releases, music releases, all which seem like they could be summarized in a page.It seems like they could make just a few more pages to fix these issues and then I would like it much more. It's just not quite a complete paper until some of these other content issues are resolved. These are somewhat minor issues, but I would find the subscription price more worthwhile if they included such content.Otherwise, this is a nice way to read the paper!I love reading the paper on the Kindle."
4,It's disgusting!,How come no one told me about this? I would have been in line on day 1 if I had heard this album before now. It's so lyrically dope it's... ahhh!
2,"It's a flashlight, not a laser!!!","Bought this little puppy recently, just looking for a little ""cat diversion"" item. Unfortunately, it is not a laser pointer, it is actually a flashlight that emits a blueish light. Not a bad little flashlight, nice for the night stand or keychain - and properly advertised wouldn't be a bad deal. But, it is NOT a laser pointer."
5,literate AND page-turning,"This whole series is really fun, and also veryclever. In the Dickens tradition, Maupincreates characters that you care about andwhose lives intertwine in the weirdest ways.This is a series that you can abandon yourselfto, and not feel guilty about it. Maupinchronicles the inhabitants of one SanFrancisco abode, but his stories and charactersare not limited to that California city.I recommend this series to anyone who wants agood exhilerating read. It's one of those rarebooks where you really need to know what willhappen next. His characters seem like someoneyou know, even the off-beat ones like Mrs.Madrigal. These people are wrastling with ourlate 20th century times- something that everyonecan relate to, but I bet they will make you forgetyour own problems for a little while."
4,A most curious book,"I was curious about the source material for a 1930s movie that I saw. This book was the source. It was written by a best selling author of the period...a romance writer. It gives much insight into the life and fantasy life of late Victorian era women. There are psychological undercurrents that are currently echoed in the interest in vampire fiction as well as books like Fifty Shades of Gray. If you read it, the film version is called ""Devotion"", starring Leslie Howard and Ann Harding. The screenwriters cleaned up the less savory aspects of the book to sell the story to the movie viewers of the period...which is another interesting subject."
4,Great flick in general,"If you love Robert Downey Jr and a good, fast-paced mystery, you will enjoy this film. Jude Law plays an excellent part as Dr Watson, as well. I couldnt wait until it came out on video, so I could watch it again!"
4,Nice follow-up.,"Really enjoyed this movie. Great follow-up to the first one. There were a few slow segments, but didn't stop the flow of the movie."
1,Movie good. Ultraviolet bad.,"I was going to buy the blu ray/rental combo for $22, but then I saw that it came with the ultraviolet ""digital copy"" and decided to rent the movie for $3.99 instead.When this movie is (if?) sold without ultraviolet, then I'll buy it. Ultraviolet is so grossly inept as a digital copy that it shouldn't even be called that. Having to create two accounts with two separate entities just to watch a movie (on approved devices only) I already have the disc for is asinine. What was wrong with the original digital copy that didn't require additional registering and I could transfer straight to Itunes/WMP? Bring the old digital copy back please.BTW, the movie was great. Get rid of ultraviolet."
2,All About Action - Not Much Story,"You would be wasting your money if you are looking to be immersed into a typical intellectual Sherlock Holmes mystery. Although the actors did a good job, I thought the material they were given to work with was sub-standard."
1,The UltraViolet Joke,"I love the film and would gladly give it four or five stars, but I will not buy any Blu-Ray with that option, and I refuse to give the packaged product an acceptable rating. I have been ripped off at least four times with this new marketing scheme. In the beginning, they promised something you could add to your computer, but that was an ambiguous promise at best, because they never came close to doing just that.I want a compatible digital copy that works through I-Tunes on my computer at home. If a glitch happens, then I want to be able to access the copy rather than find out the thing no longer works because of some kind of expiration date. The other option is a ripoff. If consumers would stop buying this option, it will vanish. I will be buying it through I-Tunes.I refuse to go through the frustration of dealing with Ultra-Violet a fifth time for nothing but added disgust for the people marketing this thing."
1,Waste of Time,Shut it off half way through. Stupid story lines and an insult to anyone who enjoys Sherlock Holmes stories. Wasted my money
1,Stupid and silly,"This was a stupid waste of time and money. I'm a fan of both Sherlock Holmes and Robert Downey Jr., but this was one hot mess of a movie. I wish I could find something nice to say about it, but I just can't."
1,BEWARE!,I thought this was gonna be a great deal on an HD movie. Wrong! The video quality was HORRIBLE! I wondered why the movie was so cheap. Now I know. Beware! Wont be buying anymore $1.99 HD videos!
2,Long Time Sherlock Holmes Fan,"Normally I am a big fan of Sherlock Holmes. I saw the first movie with Robert Downey, Jr. and enjoyed it enough to watch the second movie. However, this just did not hold my interest and I never finished watching it."
4,Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows DVD,Not as good as the first Sherlock Holmes DVD. The plot was interesting and the nmovie entertaining. Received as an gift.
3,Disappointed,Did not like this one as much as the first. Can't put my finger on any one thing. Just didn't do it for me.
1,"More action, less brains. Masses like.","I will be honest, I only watched the first 20 minutes. It became clear that this was going to be nothing but over-choreagraphed fight scenes, one on top of the other. It was completely lacking in dialogue or story--these are the key ingredients to any Guy Ritchie film, so I was doubly disappointed in that vein. Maybe I liked the first one too much, or maybe I like Sherlock (BBC) too much, because I could not stomach that much of this. I am selling it back largely unseen. Don't waste your time and ruin the experience (think Dead Like Me movie). Wait till it comes out on pay TV and ignore it then."
2,Sherlock Holmes a game of shadows,I just got through watching Game of Shadows. Being of sound mind and body I have but one question. What was this movie about? The only thing I could figure out is that it was about two hours.
4,True to the Book,I love how this movie same as the previous got to the true Sherlock Holmes while keeping it safe for family's. This one was more violent as it was about WWI and the death of Holmes and Moriarty. So I wouldn't recommend it for smaller children but for teenagers it would be perfect.
2,"Slow, very obtuse plot... Bleh.","Very disappointing after watching the first Holmes. The plot rambled so slowly that I either lost interest or forgot about the direction of the story completely. The writers were just at a complete loss. Uninteresting characters, especially Noomi Rapace's. Who is she? Why is she there? Hard to finish. Spare yourself."
3,It was okay,I rented this for someone who was visiting me. I didn't think it was as good as the first one. Maybe I should see it again...I really didn't pay much attention to it.
4,A little slow to start but still a good movie.,Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law are awesome together in this movie. They both play their characters really well and they are so funny in this movie. This one is even more suspenseful than the first. Its really slow to get into but builds really well. I enjoyed this movie.
3,"Holmes and Watson to the rescue, again!","Not to shabby action flick. At times the dialog is a bit hard to discern from the sound effects. I adjusted the center speaker volume up and dialed back the surround speakers and all is well.I think the best modern version of the Watson and Holmes adventures is ""A Seven Percent Solution"". I also recommed ""Young Sherlock Holmes"". Although not for the very young amoung us.The video qualilty in ""A game of Shadows"" was very good.The movie was fun to watch, although very predictable plot and expected action sequences. No big surprises."
4,love these movies,This was a good sequel to the first movie. Robert Downey Jr. plays the role of Sherlock very well. Worth the purchase.
5,A Game of Shadows,"At $14.99, I couldn't pass up the opportunity to pick up this title; and with my prime membership, UPS delivered it right to my door in 2 days. I highly anticipated seeing this film and was glad to learn that it did not disappoint. Packed full of action, the story line was excellent and the acting was superb. Great film to have in your collection."
1,Ultra - waste of time the Movie is great!!,It is amazing how awful this Ultraviolet copy is it is my third movie and I just hate it never been able to watch a single movie and I work for one of the biggest IT centers and have a vast experience on the field. PLEASE!!!! I beg you Amazon stop making copies with this ultraviolet or at least give an option to buy without it
3,Sherlock Holmes:A Game of Shadows,"I liked it ,and I bought it because I have the first one,I really didn't like this one as much as I did the first one.I do find it hard that Robert Downey Jr would agree to act in either of these two movies.But again this is just my thoughts."
1,UltraViolet SUCKS!!!!,"I purchased the movie hoping to watch it on my iPad, iPhone, and Apple TV. Due to the restive nature and non-consumer friendly UltraViolet digital download, I can't enjoy the movie as I'd like."
1,Why release this version after you release the other for the same price,I pre-ordered the original and It cost the same so everyone who bought the first one doesnt receive the bonus features
1,Not a Sherlock Holmes movie...,"A night and day with the first of this sequel. The characters are too far and away from the spirit of the legend and serve the need for action instead of the other way around. Very disappointing considering the production cost and the great performances. I would call it something else but this is NOT a Sherlock Holmes movie, sorry."
3,Not what I expected,"I really liked the first one, but i found it difficult to follow this one. Robert Downey and Jude Law are great, but the script did not work for me."
1,"If you love the true Sherlock Holmes, do NOT watch this garbage!!",What an insult to all Sherlock Holmes fans!! Pure trash to those who adore everything that makes Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson who they are. Not a fan of all the occultism stuff in it either. Such an insult to Sherlock's wit!! It's like they just slapped the names on some other movie!!Do yourself a favor and stay away from this terd!!
4,Great Summer Movie,"We sat on the sofa and a fine time with all the snappy dialogue between Holmes and Watson. The acting, special effects, cinematography, sets, and wardrobe were all stellar. A tad predictable but that goes with the territory and thus the 4 stars. Better than expected."
5,"More, please can I have more?","I loved the first one, and I love this one, and I can't wait for the next one. Please, please promise me that Robert Downey, Jr. will soon be coming out with a third Sherlock Holmes movie. The script, the acting the role that the music played in conveying thoughts, emotions and anticipation all were wonderful and I feel like a pathetic Oliver Twist compelled to beg, ""Please, sir, may I have more?"""
3,Cheaply Produced Copy,The quality of the cd was just ok. Almost like it had been duplicated too many times as the picture was a bit grainy.
3,A Game of Lameness!,This movie was below par for the Sherlock series. Maybe it's because I was in the middle of the Sherlock Holmes modern TV show from BBC. Not nearly as witty. Much more slapstick style comedy.
4,Good Movie,"A well-done follow up to the first movie. This was a Christmas gift for my father who really enjoyed this series. Item arrived very quickly and as described, brand new in the package. Great deal and I didn't have to fight Walmart crowds at Christmas time!"
3,So So,I was a bit bummed about this movie. Not one of Robert Downey Jrs. best roles that he has played.
5,Happy,It was a gift for my son he loved it . I always find exactly what I want here.The movie was one of his favorites. Great blue ray selections.
2,Audio,"5.1 come on. 7.1 should be a standard now. Also I would like to buy a Blu-Ray only disc. Not Combo's, that should be an option. Thanks for letting me vent."
1,boring...fell asleep,the first sherlock holmes is my opinion a fantastic movie...if you expect to find something similar..stop dreaming'...nothing you can compare...talkin'.. talking' in old fashioned english british style ...poor action..a real pain..
5,Great movie,"I really enjoyed this sequel to the first Sherlock Holmes movie which was also great. If you liked the first one, you will likely enjoy this one also."
2,Rambling mess of a movie,"The plot is all over the place, and the stiff, sometimes corny dialogue is at times difficult to discern. The flashback sequences that are supposed to explain things more often than not are just as confusing as the movie. The slow motion scenes after a while just got irritating. At least the ending brought a bit of clarity, but it was a mess getting there. With some better direction and editing, perhaps this would have been a more enjoyable movie."
3,Game of Shadows,"Sorry to say, this was not as good as the first Guy Ritchie production, although still worth watching, it lacked the quick wit and sharp dialogue as the first one, as well as the subject matter was a little more intense."
3,Worth watching,"Worth watching, but not as good as the first one. Even still a worthwhile movie, well produced, well directed well acted."
3,disappointing,"Nowhere near as witty, spontaneous or risk-taking as the first episode. Slapstick humor and mindless adventure is all that's required to entertain it seems"
4,Missing a scene,"The episode was really interesting. However, it was missing the scene where Lois decides not to marry Lex. Instead it went from Lex leaving superman in the kryptonite cage and jumped to him running away from police."
5,I love Lois and Clark!,"This is one of my all time favourite shows, and since its rarely shown on TV (just being cancelled again by TBS) DVD would be perfect. You could enjoy the episodes whenever you felt like it. This would definietly be something anyone shuld own."
5,I miss you Los,"I'm french and I want to support all the fans of ""Los and Clark"" who ask for a DVD release. I discovered the show in France in 1994 and since this moment, my sisters and I have never miss an episode. I would be so happy to see the four seasons again. Please, guys of Warner, make this dream come true as soon as possible..."
4,Superman recast as Hawksian comedy.,"Teri Hatcher isn't too far behind Jean Arthur or Rosalind Russell; she's beautiful and funny. John Shea is a delectably evil Lex Luthor, and remoulding Perry White into an Elvis freak is a stroke of genius. The Daily Planet sets cleverly reflect the influence of a 1930's comic and romantic sensibility that permeates the show. Dean Cain can't act (to put it mildly), although he certainly looks the part. It doesn't detract from the series too much because everyone else is so good, and the scripts are generally witty. Even so, Christopher Reeve's Superman (although not the film) seems more and more definitive."
5,Lois And Clark:The New Aventures of Superman,"The first season,is not really sexy,but the second season,is getting sexy.Dean Cain is gorgeous! Even an old woman in one of the episodes said,""Where is that Sexy Superman?"" I loved the magic episode."
5,Brilliant!! A must have!,"I have been a fan of Lois and Clark since the fist time it was aired on TV. I did not get to watch the complete series though, so I am really happy that they made this series into DVDs. The quality of the DVDs are really good and you get special offers from Warner Bros.If you are a fan of this series or simply just any Superman related series, Lois and Clark: The Complete First Season is a must have!"
3,Lewis and Clark,"Terrible picture, although that's to be expected for a TV series shot in the early 90's. I used to watch this show growing up and thought it was awesome. My husband and I couldn't even finish the first episode, we didn't want to waste another half hour of our lives."
5,Best Show Ever,"This is THE show I have been waiting for to come out on DVD. This is a lot better than Smallville (which I also love). Dean Cain and Teri Hatcher are the best on-screen couple I've seen. The stories are wonderful. The acting is wonderful. If you're a fan or even if you're not, BUY THIS. You will certainly not regret it."
1,A disgrace to Superman!!!,"This show had almost nothing going for it. Bad special effects, cheesy acting, terrible villains(The Wedding Destroyer?-UGH!!),bad stories,and Dean Cain a.k.a. the absolute worst Superman in the characters history. He looked and sounded NOTHING like Superman. What on Earth were they thinking when they casted him? The only bright spot was Teri Hatcher. Without a doubt, the prettiest Lois Lane ever. But Hatcher was not enough to save this piece of trash. True Superman fans hate this show. If you don't believe me,read the message boards for yourself on the Internet Movie Database. I wish I could give this disgrace of a show ZERO stars!!!"
5,Excellent,I loved this book. The wording was very sensual. I would like to read a followup book on Oliva and Jai.
3,"2.5-3 stars, COULD'VE been great, not my idea of good love story!","When I found this book online and saw all the fantastic reviews I was SO excited to locate a copy since I adore epic love stories! I found a used copy and immediatly jumped into, and was engrossed in it for the first part. THEN....stuff happens, hearts break, not at all unusual for a love story and usually makes it better if done right, but I felt the main characters spent the better portion of the book trying to make eachother miserable! It doesn't seem to be what any other mixed reviewers had an issue with, but there just wasn't enough redemption for me (SIX!! pages in the end!! 6/644!) for all the heartbreak during the book. Writing was great, story was not for me!"
4,Great prayer tool for mothers,It was a little confusing at first but now that I've figured it out I love it. What a difference it has made in my prayer life. I highly recommend.
2,Poorly worded. No depth,"Dismal notation coupled with incomplete or incoherent explanations make this book frustrating to read.The author needlessly inserts layers of abstraction, making otherwise simple concepts and formulas unnecessarily time-consuming to understand.The provided examples do make up for some of the deficiencies of the author's notation and poor wording, but not enough to make this book worth buying.The book covers many topics but does not go into sufficient depth. It's too technical for managers and not rigorous enough for technical professionals wishing to use data mining to solve real problems. If you are new to data mining, you may learn some useful overall concepts, but won't learn enough to apply them effectively. Experts should definitely look somewhere else."
4,Enough of the utensils!,"That's what the g/f said about the garlic press, the ice cream scoop and the cutting board I gave her. Really, she says she likes them but I know she's lying. The one-handed cheese grater, however, she uses every Sunday when making me pasta."
1,Wishful Thinking on the Cape,"This is a novel about Cape Cod, a narrow peninsula that projects into the Atlantic from southeastern Massachusetts. Cape Cod residents depend on a freshwater aquifer that is constantly threatened by pressure from the surrounding saltwater. There is a mysterious quality about this water that makes the locals have sex frequently and in all sorts of combinations, and it is always very good. This unusual phenomenon is irresistibly appealing to a recent graduate who wants to apply the formulas learned in the creative writing seminar at Cape Cod Community College. The exercise has all the depth of an expanded version of a TV guide synopsis of the daytime soaps. One character appears to be developed with some complexity, but her problem is dismissed casually and accurately by another character as the result of menopausal depression."
3,PC game,"Install was decent game it's self is ok to play, on time, I was very pleases with how quickly I got the product. Will do business again."
1,WILL NOT WORK ON GARMIN C 530.,WHY DOES AMAZON SAY THIS WILL WORK ON GARMIN C SERIES ?IT CLEARLY DOES NOT.
5,How AND Why,"This is likely among the best knitting books ever written, reminding me of another design classic, architect Christopher Alexander's masterful A Pattern Language. Anna Zilboorg insists that knitters understand what they are doing, not lamely follow instructions for techniques or patterns. Starting with first principles, she takes her readers step by step from the most fundamental concepts about how stitches are formed all the way through the most sophisticated techniques. She asks us to stop, observe, and think, and in so doing assumes the best of us--that we are aspiring to be artisans, not knitting machines.This is a must-have book for any serious knitter, novice or advanced. Brava, Anna!"
3,Needs a New Title,There are a surprising number of rules and opinions laid down in a book advocating knitting anarchy. I found it sort of preachy and self-important.
3,Adequate,"In the world of historical documentaries, Adolf Hitler probably leads the field as a subject. His inspiration, Mussolini, by contrast, has been almost completely neglected. There's only one other Mussolini documentary on the market that I know of(assuming it's still in print), and it's ludicrously old.This video, from the A&E Biography series, is probably about as good a life of the Italian dictator as we'll get in less than an hour. Mussolini's transition from socialism to fascism is awfully abrupt, as if he woke up one morning and decided, for no particular reason, to start the Fascist Party. One would like to have heard more about Fascism's roots in socialism and syndicalism. Nevertheless, this is the best video life of Mussolini currently available."
1,Pro-Italian bigotry in media,"Mussolini was not ""Italy's Nightmare"". This is very misleading. Italians are not the victims. He was the nightmare of other ethnic people, not italians. Wake up and see that Italians are not discriminated. Compare the media's treatment of Italians to Irish Catholics and you'll begin to realize some of the true bigotry in media history. My father was from Ireland, I was physically assaulted by Neo-Nazi skins for it. I know what I'm talking about. The media bends society's psyche to fear and respect Italians."
5,Purrrfect bed for my mom's cats,"My mom's cats love this bed. Its plushy,soft and extra comfy. It has a non-slip bottom so it doesnt move around all over and when it comes time to wash I just throw it in the washer and that's that."
3,Don't be fooled,"I am a big fan of Alan Watts. I know of no one else that has the charisma, sense of humor, and intelligence to communicate ideas from Hindu and Buddhist thought. I have read several of his books and while this book is as good as any other- I WARN YOU - it has very little about the beat generation. In fact, there is one ten page essay. It is interesting, but if you are buying this book because you are interested in the beat generation there are more informative books. This book is also a little expensive and is less than one hundred pages. Try ""Cloud-Hidden, Whereabouts Unknown"" or another one of his cheaper and longer books. Most of them contain similar ideas."
5,INSPIRING BOOK,"THIS WAS A GIFT FOR ONE WHO IS STRUGGLING SOMEWHAT WITH HER RECOVERY FROM THE DISEASE OF ALCOHOLISM. THIS BOOK HAS ALWAYS HELPED THOSE IN RECOVERY, AND HER CASE IS NO EXCEPTION. THE PRICE FROM THIS SELLER WAS VERY GOOD, AND DELIVERY WAS AMAZON-QUICK. THE BOOK IS STURDY AND WELL-MADE AND SHOULD LAST. I WILL ORDER ANOTHER OR SOMETHING SIMILAR WHENEVER NEEDED. I CAN RECOMMEND THIS BOOK AND ITS SELLER WITHOUT RESERVATION."
2,Not for families with pets,"I have have so many vaccums, hover, dyson, eureka, and now this bissell. I love the fact it's bagless and it has great suction but the filter is a chore to get out and it fills every time Iuse it. The debris collects in a very easy to remove andreplace container but it is a VERY small container and if I don't vacuum every day I have to empty it after each room. I would recommend another vacuum with a larger container and a better designed filter."
5,Works great until someone breaks it,"Pretty sure the little lady broke an attachment in a fit. I would not suggest banging parts on walls or floors unless you have some good strong tape to fix it.Once broken and left at the curb, there's a 50% chance some guy in a crappy truck will pick it up so don't worry about stuffing it in the trash can."
3,Limited usefulness,"The book is well written and very informative about the practice of meditation. The ultimate goal of meditation in this book is the achievement of shamatha. But Dr. Wallace states that very few devout Buddhist monks rarely achieve this state.Even if you never achieve the ultimate level, it would take months and even years of long periods of daily meditation to become proficient at a mid-level of meditation.It simply does not seem possible for anyone living in western society to even contemplate becoming as deeply involved as Wallace writes about.If you are looking for a well documented study of meditation with significant references, then I would certainly recommend it. If on the other hand you are seeking something to be of immediate use to you in your daily life in the western world, I think you would be well advised to find something written specifically for that purpose."
1,horrible...CS not responsive....pass this up,"Bought black....immediately bubbles appeared...spray top had narrow pattern.Called CS and got ""sorry all lines busy..."" don't buy this crap"
1,Dont waste your time,Product began to flake and peel shortly after application. Didn't even last a month. Waste of time and money.
1,Don't Buy Bissell Bagless!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Bissell has horrible customer service and terrible products. Don't waste your money! Bagless vacuums require too much up keep as well. Go for a different brand!
3,Rocket Buff,"You have to be a real freak, i suppose like me, to enjoy a title like this.Could have been better though."
4,Great read! Product Delivered Promptly,"Excellently written novel, can't wait to read the sequels (which I already own). Drags a bit towards the end but enjoyable nonetheless. Item was delivered expeditiously."
3,Fast and Loose,"This novel, the first in a 3-part series, is a good read if you are on an airplane. If you are a dedicated lover of historical fiction, and you prefer more history than fiction, then this is not the novel for you. Mr. Napier plays it loose with the historical facts, and there aren't very many of them. Firstly, the date of Attila's birth, although unknown, according to the encyclopedia and other sources appears to be around 406, not 398. The story begins in the year 408, making Attila 2 years old, more or less. The events as manufactured by the author simply are not plausible and have no basis in reality. AND - Napier's prose style is juvenile and uses current terms and sayings from the 20th century which I doubt were in vogue in the 5th century. His dialogue was disappointing, as it did not make me feel as though it came from the 5th century. As a reader, I did not feel transported back in time, which, in my opinion, is the best part of reading historical fiction."
3,after the dust settled...,"Guinness is undoubtedly a perceptive cultural critic, but this book offered more than it delivered. Guinness begins with a concise and lucid history of humanism and then attempts to trace: (1) the roots of the sixties movement in the decline of humanism; and (2) the impact of the sixties counterculture on today's society. He draws solid conclusions, to be sure, but the depth of his analysis seems wanting. His conclusions are often vaguely stated, with little or no explanation. If you wish to gain a good knowledge of the intellectual roots of the sixties rather than simply a recapitulation of events, this book is valuable. However, in terms of penetrating analysis, Guinness, uncharacteristically, falls a bit short."
5,A very important book,"As more and more focus is placed on the need for change in the U.S. health system, it is vital to understand the historical roots of health care in America. Rosenberg provides us with an exceptionally thoughtful history of our hospital system. As one reads his book some twenty years after its publication, one realizes how prescient he was, and how relevant his book remains. The book is a very important one, and should be read by anyone considering health care reform in the U.S. I might add, finally, that it is very enjoyable to read."
5,outstanding tool,"I went through the standard course in solfege with my instructor from CalArts, then we tackled Modus Novus. The work was quite demanding, but I loved it, and this book was a pleasure to work from. If you want to improve your ability to hear the harmonies and melodies of atonal, non-tonal, 12-tone, and other freely dissonant musics, you need Modus Novus. I agree with the reviewers who noted that you should not work with Modus Novus from the piano or other instrument. Yes, it's difficult, but the rewards are truly worth the efforts you'll make."
3,"slow start, strong finish","As I began reading the Shape of Water, I had difficulty ""getting into"" the story - simply put, it dragged. However, perseverence won out, and I am glad it did; the story picked up nicely about 1/4 of the way into the book as the plot thickened. It concluded strongly with a marvelously sinister twist at the end. I'm glad I stuck with it.At no point did I find the book funny - as a previous reviewer mentioned, this may be the result of a weak translation. I suspect the plodding first few chapters are similarly the result of poor translating. However, I did enjoy the way in which food was frequently refered to in the book, its prominence typcially Italian.In the final analysis, The Shape of Water is good, but not great. The story line is tight, and the plot will keep you riveted. But I can't help but think that the book may be better in the original Italian."
1,Horrible,I was really looking forward to reading this series. I read all the great reviews and was expecting an excellent read what I got was a poorly translated novel with a lack of any character development. I read the first chapter 3 times I just kept thinking I was missing something. I hope you will at least read the first few free pages before you decide to purchase
3,cheeese,its a cool trash can it looks retro and like it fits lots of my micdonalds burgers i can also eat food out of it when it got here in 3 weeks
5,Sturdy,I purchased this wastebasket for my office. I tend to put my foot/feet on the edge of wastebaskets and the rubber ones do not hold up. This wastebasket is working perfectly. I love it!!!
5,excellent game!,"This is a great game for kids AND adults. If you are looking for something not boring to play with the kids this is a good choice. Teaches strategy, and the attractive game pieces are an added pleasure. Well priced and bound to outlast many novelty games. I agree that this has the potential to become a classic. 8 and up age range seems right on. Short and strategic. Adults will not be bored!"
4,Pretty good,This product is fine and the price was excellent. I haven't found a waterer that I love yet.
4,Decent option,"So I got this guy for our 9 cats. Filling it last for about 5 or 6 days. Works fine. On the bad side, the bowl does get very dirty in that amount of time. Bits of food and litter end up in there all the time. The tank stays clean quite a bit longer. Also the plastic tends to build up slime. As we fill it every week, it gets cleaned as well pretty often so it's not bad. For the price, this is a great option for anyone with more than a few cats. If you've only got 1 or 2, the water will last weeks and you'll want to empty and clean it before that."
3,great concept; cheaply made,"We have two 90 pound dogs and it felt like we were filling their water bowl every 4 hours. I love the 3 gallon capacity, and now we refill the water every 4-5 days which is great. My complaint, though, is that it is cheaply made and very hard to line the threads up to put the top back on. We wrestle with it for several minutes every time and we never know how it will line up in relation to putting it back in the container. If its off a little, its very hard to open the top to let the water out.I love that the water lasts 4-5 days. If it didn't, this would be returned because of the hassle with the top every time."
2,Downvoting Roman,"This book is definitely over-priced (i.e. priced like a textbook). The chapters (which are mostly excerpts from longer articles)read more like historical accounts than actual archaeology. Some of the chapters are interesting, while in other articles, the authors seem like they're trying too hard to force the issue of sexuality onto whatever they're studying."
4,Statistics reference,"This is a good resource for understanding the methods and jargon found in basic statistic research publishings, but it does lack some level of detail and explanation (my opinion). I would recommend it as a supplement resouce to most statistic-based research courses, particularly if the student has not had previous study in statistic research methods."
2,Helpful to the Novice,"Although I find Connie Vanacore's book more helpful and informative, this book was alright as far as Junior Handler books go. I found that her stories tended to end with her winning, which is not how juniors always is. I'm not saying she sounded arrogant or anything, but I think maybe she could have been a bit more realistic sometimes. Some of the information was dated, but so it is in many other books. Overall, it was ok. I am a junior right now, and although it didn't seem to offer much to the more experienced junior, it could definitely offer something to the novice in the field. It was a tie between 2 and 3 stars, they just don't offer half-stars on here."
4,A wonderful book to get for a junior handler,Many years ago I was a junior handler and its a shame its taken so long for someone to write a good book for the juniors and any of us who still wish we were junior handlers again!!
4,Enjoyable read with valuable tips,"As a former exhibitor in junior showmanship, as well as an active present day exhibitor in the conformation ring at dog shows, I found this book to be valuable. The book was an easy, enjoyable read, yet full of useful tips. After reading this book I kept it near my training area to remind myself of the things I wanted on with the dogs, having earmarked those items for easy reference, especially the fancy turn on the down and back. I recommend this book not only for juniors, but also for active exhibitors."
1,BETTER BOOKS ARE OUT THERE!!!,"I found this book very uninformative. There was some good information for beginners but thats it. Most of the information is very outdated and should never be used. The stories were quite entertaining but seemed very self-absorbed. All and all it was quite a bad book the subject. If you really want a good one get ""The Winning Edge""."
5,Astounding!,"I was rather reluctant to purchase this cd, especially since it costs around $30 for only five songs. I am so glad I decided to purchase it. After listening the the first track, it was worth the price. The compositions are absolutely flawless, and Miss Battle gives each piece such life. I almost felt as if I understood the words because she is so good at communicating the text.Buy this cd! You will not be disappointed. It is definitely worth it. I'd gladly pay $100 for it. Beautiful!"
3,"Good, but could be better","The item description says that these bookends have nonskid rubber feet. Mine did not come equipped with anything resembling a nonskid surface. Bare metal on my glass shelves limits their usefulness. I'll probably end up buying some kind of nonskid applique at the hardware store, but I shouldn't have to bear the extra expense."
4,"Reminiscent of Jack Vance, but a little grosser.","If you liked Nift the Lean by this author, you will definitely appreciate this book."
4,Works well,"Generally I use this to tie down my camping equipment. I have used this product twice and I find the quality of the product is good. The spring stretches smoothly, and the flex grip bar handle has a soft-grip release mechanism. Some reviewers have complained that this product is difficult to use, but I never had any problem and neither is my wife in using this product."
3,This book is not for the novice....,"If you're still trying to understand just how relational databases work, don't start with this book. In fact, read several more beginner-level books before trying to deal with this one. I'm half way through and can't say I comprehend any of what I've read. I did read wonderful reviews before I purchased ""Database Modeling and Design,"" so there are many advanced readers who will surely benefit from the dry and technical style of writing and presentation in Teory's book. This is a perfect case of using so many source references that the author forgot to write for the reader, instead of for fellow academics. The marketplace now has a new type of database designer and analyst - those with liberal arts degrees, not engineering!"
1,X-Box 360 Power Supply (sold broken),"I bought this power supply, hooked it up and nothing but an orange standby light came on. Had the x-box 360 checked out it was fine. I was sold a broken power supply. Tried contacting the company a week ago and no response from them. Beware!!!!"
5,What cost is Human Life,"in their pursuit of profits British Railway company's have laid off staff and delivered dividends to share holders at any cost - the Greed is good concept is alive and well in the Private Ownership of British Railways. They stand condemned and have blood on their hands . This book is a must for British Railway readers to see how Governments have wrecked the once fine name of British Railways - after reading this book there is a stong case to have the Railways returned to Government ownership , private operation have proved time and time again they can't be trusted with people lives."
4,Good option to modify hair color subtly,This product will dry your hair out so I suggest using a good conditioner. It's a great option for modifying the color of your hair without expensive salon visits or permanent hair dye at home treatment options.
3,A rush job??,"In many ways, this is a very good dictionary. Lots and lots of saints, with average entries of c. 20-25 lines per saint. This dictionary doesn't have more errors than the average saints' guide, and less than some. (Farmer's Oxford Dictionary of Saints has the most scholarly and thorough coverage, but fewest saints; the Benedictines of Ramsgate's The Book of Saints has an enormous number of saints but with very brief entries AND NO INDEX LISTING SAINTS BY THEIR FEAST DAY.) What is truly annoying about Delaney's volume is the listing of saints by feast day---which is really the shoddiest thing I've seen in ages. There are dozens and dozens of errors, ranging from wrong date to listing the saint by a variant of name that doesn't actually appear in the text. It's very frustrating to use."
4,Good Reference Book,"Like a dictionary or encyclopedia, has a short paragraph about each of the Saints recognized by the Roman Catholic Church. Also contains a calendar listing of the saint's day. Very basic descriptions"
2,Its okay.,"Its not quite what I thought it would be, but its okay. Very informative, just not extremely interesting."
2,wy the high ratings?,"I read about 110 pages of this book and I jsut don't get why it has so many 5 star reviews. Maybe everyone else who read this is lookign for something totally different than I am. I found that the politcs in this were boring and presented in a boring fashion. There was only one interesting character (in the first quarter of the book) and she never did much of anything. The writing itself wasn't all that good, often going into too much detail abotu stuff that didn't advance the plot. I say that because I couldn't even detect a plot in the first quarter of this book.So, I have no idea why this has so many high ratings at all. It seemed dry and dreary and completely devoid of life to me."
5,Excellent,"This is the first book of a great fantasy trilogy written by Jack Vance, one of the 2 or 3 best living authors in the genre. The Lyonesse trilogy is undeservedly obscure, it should be mentioned in the same breathe as ""The Lord of the Rings"", or ""Gormenghast"", yet it languishes out of print. A wonderful, absorbing read distinguished by Vance's elegant, unusual prose."
5,I thought I knew a lot about drugs,"I thought I knew a lot about drugs having grown up in the 1960's but the world of recreational drugs and drug usage is much broader and alarming than I knew. Ms. Falkowski has created an easy-to-understand reference of drugs, their usage effects, duration, overduse dangers and good solid information on recognizing their use and where to go for help. As a parent and workplace manager I wish I'd had this book years ago. I hope this book is updated frequently. Let me know when the next edition is released!"
1,Terrible recording in every way possible,"Quite how Daniel Smith managed to get ASV to release this CD I have no idea; his bassoon playing is worse than most amateurs (though all credit to Roger Vignoles, who accompanies fantastically). The tone is scratchy, the intonation is appalling in several places and there are a number of split notes. On top of this much of the content feels far too rushed and the phrases have an overly slushy shape.Rarely am I so disappointed with a recording - I bought this on impulse as the only recording I have of the Hurlstone is on the ""L'Apres-Midi d'un dinasour"" LP with Lawrence Perkins, and I no longer have a record player.0 stars from me - be warned!"
3,Average...,"This book wasn't the best I've read, for certainly sure. Maybe that's because it wasn't anything like I expected what with all the rave I'd heard.To begin with, the cover is not positioned properly, so the writing is upside down when you put it on your bookshelf. Oops.Next, I was expecting to learn something new from this, but it's basically a rehash of martial arts that you can find in many other books, so to say that I'm now ready to claim some sort of knowledge of White Crane would be over-extending my credibility. I much prefered the book written by Dr. Yang. I got a lot more out of it.But I don't want to bash it too much. It is a nice book, and he does show the ""basics"" that he's offering. If that is what you're looking for, you'll like it."
3,"Problem solved, but it does not last forever","My daughter's bike has no other place for a water bottle holder, so this works just fine to put one on the handlebars: problem solved.New problem #1: it does not grip the handlebar totally steadily. It shifts (rotates) a bit as the bottle is pulled-from and shoved-into the holder. I'll have to try putting some handlebar tape under it and see if that helps.New Problem #2: it breaks. We've gone through two of these in two years, as they have both broken at the weld in the middle. Then again, the item is so inexpensive that I find it silly to complain much about that. I just think of it as a consumeable product that needs replacing annualy (when it breaks)."
4,Works on my daughter's mountain bike,"I ordered this for my 12 yr. old's mountain bike handlebars. She needed something in easy reach for water for our family bike rides, and this did the trick. She hasn't had any complaints while using it.It was a little awkward to install around the brake lines, but I managed to get it in there alright. She had to help me hold the wires out of the way, I don't think I could have done it by myself since I don't have four hands.The cage is a bit tight for some of our water bottles, but now that we know which ones fit it best, those are the ones she'll use. It bends a tiny bit, but not much, so don't expect to be able to adjust it much at all.This also came with two extra foam pieces for the center of the attachment piece, just in case they need to be replaced, or perhaps for extra padding. We have not needed them yet."
2,guitar and amp combo,"When I received the guitar and amp, the guitar had a damaged spot on it. When I tried to contact their customer service department, there is no answer, only a recorded message to send them an email. So I did. Now three days later, no one has returned my email or call. Looks like my son is going to get a damaged guitar for his birthday. Beware!!! I also did not get the extra strings with it."
3,Not what I expected.,"Sheath has a concave to it to retain the machete. Concave presses against the bade . And wtf is that thing they call a belt clip? I cant even figure out how that works. If anyone has email me at gh0zt36@gmail.com with a tutorial on how to use that belt clip. Your thinking "" belt clip tutorial?? wtf?? "" Yea.... exactly it looks like a reshaped super heavy gauged paper clip. Like no belt clip i've ever seen ."
2,It's ok,"I got this for my Ontario machete it works ok, except the mounting for your belt has a screw on the inside that will scartch the finish on it. I took it off and made belt loop with 550 cord. If it wasn't cause of that I would had rated it 5"
4,Good for people with no knowledge of Biochemistry,"I am currently trying to use this book for a Biochemistry course that I am taking. Considering that I have close to ""Zero"" knowledge in Chemistry, this is probably the best book that I can use for a variety of reasons (see below)1) Book is in color2) Although best to study the book chronologically, its not impossible to skip chapters. There is a great Glossary index at the back of the page which has some definitions written into them. Furtheremore definitions seems to be clearly/concisely written throughout the book, very helpful.3) Examples written throughout the book with soultions.4) Parargraphs are kept to a minimum so that you wont get too bored reading through the text.I am giving this book a 4, but from my limited experience of looking at chemistry books this is the best one thats out there.It won't be a breeze studing this book, but there are many more books out there which makes the task of studying chemistry a lot harder then it is."
1,"HE'S WRONG...SURELY, YOU CAN SEE THAT","How is he wrong? He misrepresents Dr. Craig's view on the cosmological argument and he misrepresents Dr. Hodge's view as well. He misrepresents Hodge so badly it's almost unforgiveable. He's so biased and arrogant that it's just beyond me how people don't see it. Did he chicken out on his debate with Dr. Bahnsen? He had to have otherwise why would he submit an article to a Christian journal. I mean, didn't those Christians ""bank"" off of his name?"
3,Ok for the price.,"I picked this game up used for less than $10. I would not spend more than that. Its fine for a throw away shooter. Decent weapons and game play. Nice game in between other heavy hitters (half life, bioshock, etc). Forget the story -- not sure what was going on -- didn't care: just wanted a shooter fix!Note: there was a terrible glitch -- not sure if it was due to vista or not. On several of the levels, there appeared to be blind spots (not sure how else to describe it). As I moved around, the screen would go blank, occasionally it would go away if I moved around enough. Eventually I had to get a cheat to skip the level -- otherwise I could not proceed. The patch did not resolve the issue."
3,need better sights on weapons...spend lots of time shooting and reloading at one enemy,"good looking game, but poor weapon sights. fun buy it cheap before its gone."
1,Pariah is Another Sad Example of the FPS Glut,"Just a few years ago Pariah would have garnered praise and a decent fanbase. Unfortunately, in today's market, it sits squarely among a legion of also-ran first person shooters.I found the single player game to be offendingly tedious. While the creators tried to tell an interesting story, it was lost in the uninspired level design and irritatingly awkward weapons. Props for the healing tool, though. The way the healing tool and health are handled is the only innovative aspect of the game.The last straw for me was the fact that the single player game is checkpoint based. After ten tries of running over a bridge and methodically mopping up the enemies, only to die from a grenade I could never see coming, I uninstalled the game."
2,Not so much,"I was really excited about these, until I tried to use them. They are really tricky to put on. I'm sure once you get the hang of them they are great, but I wasted all of them trying to get them to work. I'm a C cup and nothing I did seemed to make them want to hold anything up. It didn't help that the directions suck. I was really disappointed. They probably work fine for a smaller cup size but I would not recommend them for larger sizes."
2,Meh,"I'm a 34DD and was hoping that these might do a little more than pasties, but they just don't. I stay up pretty well on my own, I just wanted to get a little extra coverage. They are also tricky to get off their backing without ruining and start curling up the instant they go on."
4,"Cry, Lie and Over Fifty? Steal - the best CBS compilation of Five-0 episodes yet. DVDs around the corner?","Cry Lie is one of the best episodes of the seriesyet. Character Chin Ho Kelly (his character wasbased on real like Honolulu Private Det. of Chinese/Irish background!) has his character developed fullyfor the first time. We learn that he likes boxingmatches, going to church and bowling. The real lifeactor, Kam Fong Chun died at age 84 two years ago.Kam Fong was in the first 10 of 12 seasons of theHawai'i Five-0 series. His character was killed offin the last episode of the ten season, called, ""ADeath in the Family"". The second episode here on thistape is: Over Fifty? Steal, a great showcase for thecharacter of Hume Cronyn, a canadian who plays Mr.Filer, a disguise expert. Get this tape, before it'sgone!"
5,Nice item!,"I have three kids, so I wanted somewhere to stick stuff from school until it can be used or filed away. The rack can be attached to the wall, or just set on the desk. Perfect for our uses!"
3,slants forward a lot.,"i don't know if it's the design or the particular piece i got. anyway, i used it to layer some modems and computer gear. they don't get too hot and the rat's nest of wires is hidden behind the rack."
5,ROLODEX MESH Three-Tier Desk Shelf (22341),"This is a very great product and I strongly recommend it. It's the best one I have bought from Amazon. It is as it said in the ad - ""three shelves"" and I will like to add,""very strong construction material, nice shelf spacing and looks very nice on my desk. Only one draw-back, the base is a little smood and sometimes tends to slide away on-top my desk, from where I wanted it to stay but with added rubber pads to the base, its perfect."
3,Review of Eldon File Tray,"The product is a beautiful wooden file tray. However, beware, the picture illustrates a double tray when in actuality you buy each piece separately! It is a good price even separately, but could cause a delay in getting organized and additional mailing costs when you have to re-order. You also have to order the pieces that hold up the stand and I haven't been able to figure out how to do that yet."
5,THIS IS THE BEST BEST LOVE BOOK EVER!!!,"I've read every single one of McDaniel's book, and so far, this is the best one she's written! It's #1 on my list!! This book is full of happiness, inspiration, and ends in a tragedy. It takes a lot for a book to actually make me shed a tear, but somehow McDaniel manages to let my emotions out. I found out that you will definately need a box of tissues for this one. This book shows how far one will go when they love someone as much as April loved Mark."
5,A very touching story by Lurlene McDaniel,"The story begins when April Lancaster is in the hospital for constant severe headaches. She meets a man named Mark Gianni, who has cystic fibrosis. He immediately likes April when he first sets eyes on her. But April is hesitant because she already has a boyfriend, the soccer coach from her school. Meanwhile, April learns that she has a reoccurrence of what happened to her five years ago, an enlarging brain tumor. She undergoes treatment while seeing Mark more and more. She goes out with him to restaurants, to the car races that he drives in, etc. They fall deeper in love as time goes on. Soon, April finds out that her tumor is dormant but the treatment hasn't shrunk it at all. She is deeply upset but Mark is the only one who can help her. He asks April to marry him and she agrees. But will their dream of living a ""normal"" life together come true? Read this very touching and well-written story to find out. It was one of the best books I have read."
1,Not happy,"The Camcorder which I bought, has been displayed as it include a remote comtrol, and when I received the product I found that it is optional (Which is mentioned in the Manual!! which I cannot read untill I open the BOX!!). when I followedup with all, I got refund of 32$ not the missing part.The quality of the camcorder is worst, it has high noice in every mode.Overall If I would give 0 star, but I dont have thaty option here.Buy any other, but not this one"
2,Eh...,"This works well, but the whole idea of having ANOTHER thing mounted on your window is getting a bit out of control. Sirius rapes you on their prices and the signal cuts out anytime I pass under any sort of tree (with or without leaves), or anytime I'm in New York City and the tall buildings are near. Unless you are in the wide open, this things cuts in and out of signal which makes it VERY annoying to try to listen to any program no matter how good or bad it is, and no matter how expensive it is just to listen to a radio. I say go buy an iPod Touch or any smartphone and download the [...] application. Its a better product and its FREE!!! I subscribed to SIRIUS for 5 years and they treated me like garbage (one lady even telling me to 'shut up'), constantly overcharged me, and constantly raising prices. As for SIRIUS, I say they are a horrible company... for this product, I say it's OK if you live in a wide open area, but if you live near trees, mountains, or buildings, I say don't bother."
5,Great!!,Had for a few months and I haven't had any complaints! I have it directly hooked up to my car stereo though so I don't know how good the FM transmitter is. Wold definitely tell my friends to buy this! I listen to Howard Stern so it's nice to be able to pause it when I get a cell phone call and don't have to miss anything.
1,Plug & Break,"Excellent piece of equipment-for the 3 days I was able to listen to it! The ""plug"" broke WHILE IT WAS SITTING IN THE CAR overnight. I have been unable to get a replacement. I can't find a person to talk to since it was made in China. The only contact on the box or in the instructions is SIRIUS radio, and of course they don't know anything about the radio. They wasted no time charging me an activation fee however, for a service I have been unable to listen to. I did get an E-mail from Amazon.com acknowledging my request, and when I followed up, another acknowledging my request. Nothing has happened. (cricket sounds)"
2,"Good, but not as good as they used to be!","I purchased this as an upgrade from my Starmate 3 receiver. UGH! I am really disapointed in the unit. It's good for home use, where it can be connected to a stereo, and have not FM reception problems.But, the FM reception is TERRIBLE in my cars...I agree 100% with the other person who talked about direct connection option, as I think that's the only way to get clear reception from this unit. Sirius added an extra FM Modulator to the unit, to try to improve the reception, but in my opinion, it's useless!I LOVED my Starmate 3, and now, I only wish I still had that unit. I had heard from Sirius customer service people that they had to lower the frequency strength in the new Starmate 4 and new units to meed FCC regulations... what a shame, as it makes listening to the radio a drag sometimes....Bottom line, the unit is Okay, but I only can hope the Starmate 5 will be a better unit than the 4...."
3,VACUUM IS VERY HEAVY TO PUSH!,"This vacuum does a great job, but is rather heavy for me. I also bought one for my neighbor because the price was right and she has the same complaint. However, it does an excellent job and the dirt cup and filter are easy to clean. The seller did a fast job of shipping."
2,Good while it lasts - which isn't long.,"Great price, and when it works, it works. However, it only works for about a year and a half, and then it starts to not pick up anything anymore. Not even the hose will pick up anything. Not worth the time or energy to repair, because, as other commenters noted, takes forever to clean and it has to be cleaned all the time. I don't recommend this to people who don't want to purchase a new vacuum every year."
4,One of the Best Science Fiction Books Ever Read,"The WYRM is filled with action and adventure, a book perfect for any thrill seaker. This book also allows people to actually see how far people will go to reach that goal for everlasting life...even if it means the death of those they hold dear...and of how people can care for each other so much that they are willing to lay down their lives. The only reason I give this book a 4 is because I want more and I can't wait for the release of Book 2. The suspenseful and chilling ending of Book 1 is something that will be in the back of my mind anytime I think about that book. This book is filled with futuristic settings but themes that hit so close to home that it is ""scary."" The WYRM has been released perfectly around a time that terrorism plagues are streets and it is a time that we too want to look to a hero. Simply said, I cannot wait until The Wyrm Book 2 is released."
3,Insider's Guide to Medical School Admissions (Insider's Guide to Medical School Admissions) (Paperback,"the book isn't too helpfull. Thanks God it wasn't too expensive. Only a small fraction of the book was about the addmission process. If you already know something about the whole thing and seek more info, it's not a good choice!"
4,Emporer Jones,"It was good to see this movie again. I never forgot it after first seeing it in a college fine arts course I took twenty years ago. It is a classic example of ""man vs. himself."" And it shows the great Paul Robeson in his prime."
3,Finns of Death,"Let's hear it for Finnish Death Rock! The title track of this 4 song e.p. joyously commands us to ""Say you love Satan!"" to infectious effect. It's a well-played, hooky bit of thrashy, melodic goth-metal, and remixed enjoyably as the ""St. Vitus Dance Mix"" (""Dance upon your God-damned soul!"") on track three. ""Fey"" is a lush mid-tempo number that further evokes goth influnces like Siouxsie and the Banshees and Bauhaus as much as it does Black Sabbath. Track four is an MPEG of the band's video for ""Sol Niger."" Neither the song nor the clip is particularly engaging, but they aren't bad either."
4,Hard to read but well worth it!,"It's hard to read about going on after your child dies. But if you can push thru and read this there are a few good seeds that get planted to help you cope. Not a favorite, anyone trying to tell me its ok to go on after my child has died is full of it- this doesn't push that down your throat. When the time is ready for you- buy this one- you'll know when that is!"
5,For those experiencing the the worst of losses,"I bought this book to send to friends who'd just lost their son to SIDS. I did read it before I sent it, and I chose it because it did not preach, give advice, or expound upon the stages of grief, etc. It's a collection of stories, essays and poems written by people who have lost children. Not sure if my recommendation counts, since I was not the intended audience. There are really no words that can comfort someone going through such catastrophic loss, but, as these editors say in their preface, sometimes hearing other peoples' stories of what they went through can hopefully give the grieving person at least some sense that they are not alone in the darkness. My friends, like so many others, have survived, but the profound sense of loss never goes away, something I thought this book illustrated quite well."
4,"If you liked ""Eddie & the Cruisers""...","JC & the BBB, the voice of ""Eddie & the Cruisers"" came out with this album after the soundtrack to that movie showed that people liked their sound. This Providence, RI band's first album is chock full of good tunes. I saw them live twice while in college and one of the highlights of the show was the ""C-I-T-Y"" audience participation ala the ""YMCA"" one done at sporting events today---c'mon do it with me now! You can hear traces of the Boss throughout but especially on tracks 1 and 2. Add it to your collection, you won't be disappointed."
5,the Terra cotta Dog,Nice change from the usual mysteries. The international flair kept me interested throughout. I would read more with this main character.
4,Like these books very much,"Enjoyable setting, plot and characters. Good stories well crafted and deftly written. Always look forward to my next Montalbano mystery."
4,Sicilian sleuth,"While browsing through the mystery section at an English-language bookstore in Rome a few years ago, a fellow customer asked me if I had ever read Andrea Camilleri. ""He's the Italian John Grisham!"" she said. That was a recommendation I couldn't ignore so I picked up THE TERRA-COTTA DOG, which I could see dealt with the Mafia, one of my all time favorite topics. I read the book and enjoyed it very much, but I have to say the woman was a bit off in her comparison to Grisham. Camilleri's Inspector Montalbano is a bit more like Lee Goldberg's Mr. Monk--a cranky, idiosyncratic, but brilliant sleuth. He's a lot of fun to follow, and Camilleri's depiction of Sicilian society delights and surprises."
3,Okay; this book was Okay,"When I picked up this book and started reading it, I was riveted. Then my parents drug me away so I never read the end until now, a year later. Unfortunately, I wasn't that impressed with it. The action and vocabulary has a little too childish of feel to it, and to a Venom fan, Eddie just doesn't have the same ruthless character Diane Duane and Marvel built him up to have."
3,Typical Mary Jane Holmes,"If you're a Mary Jane Holmes fan, you'll enjoy this book. A bit melodramatic but fits right in with the author's syle. Not my favorite but enjoyable."
2,They should have stopped at season 7,"I became weary of House by season 8,it was falling into a bad void..Cuddy left,and she was a major character which held the show together...the addition of Park the oriental doctor did give the show a few laughs with her sparkling personality and wit. I think the writers overdid the Vicodin..putting it in the same category as heroin and other hard drugs. The whole thing got tiresome, and it seems the actors also tiring of the show, they made the supreme effort, but could not pull it off.Hugh Laurie has gone on to the music industry with his band, I wish him luck."
3,Love it or hate it,"I give it a 3 star because I hated it but my wife loves it. I think House is an arrogant d-bag, and likes to berate patients instead of helping them. When I see a doctor I want it to be somebody who cares, and who doesn't guilt me for being sick; whatever the choices I have made.The wife on the other hand loves the cheap drama and the suspense. As a professional person, I don't think this is a realistic story that could happen in the medical community."
3,DVD problems,"Purchased this for my mother who adores House. The episodes are great, but 2 of the DVD's are defective. One, I eventually was able to get to play, but the other one has a huge scratch and will not load. No idea how new DVD's get scratched. All of them take a LONG time to load - so I'm not sure if all of them are a little defective or it's some copy protection thing they put on them that my player doesn't like. Now I have to figure out how to send this back. I never expected to get damaged DVDs that were brand new and sealed."
5,House Season 8,I'm a huge House fan. We loved this final season. Wish it was longer and wasn't 100% thrilled with the ending. Maybe that's because I wish it hadn't ended
5,Great Way to End A Series,"As the series comes to a close in the final season, they could not of thought of a better way to get the character House to re-evaluate his life. Makes me sad, but hey, they did a fantastic job."
4,Nice Start,I wasn't sure if I would be watching this season after the torture of watching the last half of last season. I decided to give this premiere a try and I am glad I did. It is just House and no one does it better than Hugh Laurie. Good solid episode to get back in the game.
2,Season 8 is a mistake,"I have followed all of the House seasons from season 1. I am a huge House fan, and I was more than disappointed with Season 8. It ruined House for me. The acting from the new cast was terrible and the script was bad. House's character didn't have his usual wit.The season was not really about the medical cases, it was mostly useless drama with random cases thrown in the background.As far as I am concerned, House ended with Season 7, and Season 8 is just a mistake."
5,HOUSE is MORE than anyone can imagine!,"Yay HOUSE. I'm going to miss you terribly-- and all the actors and others associated with this show. The only one I liked better was The West Wing... the greatest show of all time, I think.I'll never forget House and his humor. Weird humor but truly funny. And HL's great acting.Sigh. Why do the good things have to end so soon?"
1,two thumbs down,"item arrived on time, no complaints there... It seems the last two discs of this set are blank, they wont play in any of the 5 dvd players in my home :("
5,APA's review of graduate programs in psychology,This is a comprehensive and complete listing of graduate programs in psychology with accurate and up to date information.
2,not quite what I had envisioned,"When the item was stated as being mahogany and with the photo of it, I expected it to be finished better. It is mahogany and has been stained, but does not have a smooth clear coat on it. This makes it look kind of cheap."
4,Great for pasta and veggies,The only thing I do not like about this pot is I wish it were nonstick. It stains and doesn't look brand new after first use. Decent pot though for the price.
4,Product as advertised,Product is as advertised. Cleans very easily. Handle on top is only fair - it gets very hot and could be improved.
2,The label is terribly inconsiderate!,"They use an ultra sticky label that takes an hour to scrape off. And of course, the directions are on the other side of the label which you won't be able to read because they will be torn off when you peel off the label. Very inconsiderate. Seems like a small detail but it's not a good way to start off a purchase and I won't be buying another."
2,Not what I was looking for,"I was really excited to get this dutch oven! When it arrived in the mail, it looked beautiful. While not as heavy as my other 18/10 stainless steel pots & pans, it seemed like it would do the trick. After using it only one time (to cook some pasta) and then washing it up, I noticed a bunch of tiny little ""divots"" in the bottom of the pan, along with some rust spots. None of my other pots & pans do this (and they've gotten heavy use over the last 5 years), this is not the quality I was looking for, even at this price. If it does that after one light use, then I don't think I want to see what will happen as I continue to use it. Sad to say, I am returning it for a refund."
2,This album STINKS!,"The songs on Swing Party 2000 are all very good, but the performances by the Tony Burgos Orchestra are lackluster! The box should tell people that the CD is by the Tony Burgos Orchestra NOT the Tony Burgos Orchestra. They only tell you on the back of the box, in very fine print. I am very dissapointed and angry with this CD."
5,Bass God pulls it off again!,"Need not say more... Sheehan is a bass god and cannot fail! And on this one he sings, writes and produces, plus his bass is, needless to say, flawless!Did I mention that Sheehan rocks on the bass like no-one else? ;-)Truly amazing work!"
5,Works Great,"Used it for an 800mm lens. Works out great! Now looking to buy a telescope to attach my camera to! If you can, buy one for each lens you want to use it on so you don't have to screw it on and screw it off all the time."
2,Not well designed,"Let be preface this review with a simple acknowledgement, I haven't used many T-mounts in my lifetime. In fact, this was the first. However, to that end, I tried to do everything by the book when utilizing this mount. I'm compelled to write this review b/c this adapter's driven me crazy.In short, I've given up with this pile of junk. It's a poorly constructed, poorly designed mount that can't handle the stress a canon rebel places on it. After three uses, my inner ring is useless. No matter how tight I compress the screws against it, it doesn't hold together. The outer ring grips the camera with no problem. However, might as well just use duct tape to secure the camera b/c this t-mount simply falls apart after a few tries. The mount itself fails to secure safely, leaving the very real possibility of a camera taking a dive.Very disappointed in this adapter."
5,Perfect T-mount adaptor for Digital Rebel,Purchased this for my Canon Digital Rebel XS so that I can mount the camera on my Celestron telescope. Received VERY quickly from 47th Street Photo. Adaptor fits the camera and the C90 T-mount (from Celestron) perfectly and is very well made and solid. Now I just have to get out and do some stargazing!
3,Haven't read this book but have a good tip for Band fans...,"re: an amazing book by Greil Marcus called Mystery Train:Images of America in Rock 'n' Roll, which includes a long section on the Band. Mystery Train is one of the best pieces of rock journalism ever written. So while Across the Great Divide may include information re: the post- and latter-day Band, Mystery Train's the one to get for a sense of why and how the group is so important. MT's other sections - on Elvis Presley, Robert Johnson, etc. - are also riveting for anyone interested in the connections between American history, music, and something deeper."
3,It was ok,"It was an inexpensive alternative to a real remote listening device. Fun to play with, but honestly, it only works if there is no noise around your target. Also loses considerable clarity when there are noises near you, even behind you. I gave it 3 stars only because I figured it would have more to offer."
3,Forgetful,"I like this series, but she is inconsistent in her writing. In the previous book Grey Eagle had a vision of Rebecca and Bright Arrow's love and of the child Shalee would carry named Sun Cloud. No mention of that.....at all."
4,Gone Hollywood?,"I love anything by Agatha Christie and enjoyed these dramatizations, but I was so disappointed and angry that questionable situations and ""Hollywood-style"" smut has been inserted where none was written. Agatha Christie sometimes suggested such situations, but she never showed or described it. Why couldn't things have been left wholesome so that we could watch without being offended or being afraid our children or grandhildren would see such CRAP and believe it to be normal and acceptable behavior????? Bring back the old Christie...and David Suchet, I'm disappointed that you would lower yourself to allow such garbage."
1,Disappointed,"I didn't like this new collection at all. They changed each story to include something ""modern"" and ugly. The reason Agatha Christie is so enjoyable is her ability to puzzle you without being vulgar or particularly violent. I hope this is not an indication of direction of any more of the Poirot stories. Don't change the stories of an expert into something she would never have written."
3,too unpredictable,this blade really isnt that good. it doesnt stay on your lancher good so when u launch it the blade doest get the whole rip plus its engine gear just lets out a short burst of speed when u first lauch it. this would be good but its a sharp tip and so high up that almost any blade can rip right into its base. IF I WERE U I WOULDNT GET IT
4,"Good value, but the bag is a little short","At this price, I'm not complaining. I just wanted to point out that I wear a 10.5 size shoe and the bag is hard to close. The shoes fit in there all the way, but there isn't enough clearance to close the bag fully without having the shoes on top of each other. If these bags were a little bit longer, it would receive 5 stars."
5,They do the job,over time my dress shoes get dusty so I decided instead of putting them back in there original box I would put them in bags it's working out great will buy more.
4,Great camera but....,"Pentax gives you quite a punch to capture images. I have owned my camera for three years and find it to be very flexible. It adapts to its surroundings and gives countless options for those who want to manually adjust. I would have rated 5 stars except for the fact that it collects dust which is typically of most of the early DSLRs. In order to remove the dust, you have to spend lots of time with Photoshop OR pay $120 buck to have an expert blow out the dust. This is a great camera but you need to be very careful when you change lens to prevent dust from collecting inside."
4,Decent Bathing Suit,"I bought these thinking they were shorts. Turns out, it is a bathing suit. As a bathing suit, they are decent. Nothing too special, but decent."
3,When it works it works but it doesn't always,"It worked for me first time on XP SP2 but when I unplugged the cable and plugged it back in, XP reverted back to the generic Microsoft MIDI driver. So I followed Kevin R. Araki's instructions and it's working again.Just follow Kevin R. Araki's instructions and it'll work. Kevin is one of the reviewers on this page. Nice work Kevin!"
4,A good product,"A good, easy to install and use product for connect your keyboard (midi device) to the computer. I am using a mac and the installation was as simple as possible. It if definitely worth the price and performance. Great for home use, though I am not so sure for professional purposes."
4,Works perfectly well for my limited purposes,"I use this to enter notes into a notation program (Lime) from a Casio PSR-170 keyboard, and for that limited purpose, it works perfectly. I am also able to use the keyboard as an output device in the notation program."
1,No Windows 7 support (and in no hurry to provide any),"It takes alot of nerve to continue to sell a product that will not work on the latest and widely accepted version of Windows. It's not like Win 7 just came out last month, and there should be enough similarity between 7 and Vista in terms of driver architecture that creating a driver for this should not have been a problem. M-Audio apparently does not want to invest in providing drivers for anything but their most expensive products, so if you have Win 7 or believe you may anytime in the foreseeable future, look for hardware from a company that will actually support its own products. FAIL."
2,Can't use with 64-bit computer,"I bought this device to be able to tie my electronic piano into my new computer which does not have a MIDI port. My new computer is a Windows 7 64-bit computer that is small with only multiple USB ports. It wasn't until I actually got the device that I learned there's no 64-bit support from M-Audio. Looking at the advertisement web pages did not even hint at this. I suppose I should have done more homework before buying, but that shouldn't have to be the way things are. So I bought this thing and can't use it."
5,Does the job,"I use this to get a midi signal to my pc from my professional Peavey keyboard which is quite old. Tweak the software to make sure there is no latency and you're good to go. I don't remember much about the set up but it went pretty smoothly and I used this to teach kids piano lessons with various software programs. They had lots of fun learning that way. As other have said here, check for compatibility with your OS before purchase. This is a pretty old model."
1,"Bad product, no drivers, no support",This is probably one of the most worthless pieces of equipment that I've ever purchased. The company that markets them doesn't have the drivers updated and the ones that you can download only load half the time (if you're lucky). I threw this in the trash heap.
1,"Add me to the ""not at all"" list","Midi works to send output to the midi controller (keyboard) but does not work to send input to the computer. Good luck trying to get customer service. Major headache. The ""plug and play"" machine needed to have a driver update in order to get it to continue to not work. What. A. Piece. Of Junk. Only gave it 1 star because I don't think Amazon will allow me to give it less."
4,Bravissimo!!,"This summer I discovered this fantastic singer/song writter through my boss who had received this double CD as a gift from siblings in Italy... This is our non-stop music in the office... Even though I don't understand italian (planning on learning this fall) it is an enjoyable CD, my first one of Renato Zero, but surely not the last! Enjoy the moment!"
1,"Horrible, save your money!!!",I bought these shoes about 2 months ago and they are already ruined. The leather is so thin that it has separated and is peeling.
4,Storage solutions,"I have ordered these products by rubber maid for my office and it has turned a cluttered mess into an organized, easy to find office supply space."
1,lack summation for the UML symbols,"The book does NOT give a good summary on the explanations for the symbols used for UML, and thus creates difficulties understanding those symbols quickly. The book has a lot more to improve for readability."
1,absolutely horrible,"im actualy quite mortified after listening to this. first of all the guitar playing is horrendous. sounds like their guitarists have never picked up a guitar before.2nd, the vocals suck. the vocalist just cant scream. i would not recomend this. if ya want good music, try norma jean, unearth, blood has been shed, and the agony scene."
4,Interesting way to explore Babylon,"This book was enjoyable in that the story, the scope, and the settings were all manageable for the reader. It's a pretty darn respectable mystery, too. If you are looking for something with epic sweep, this isn't it. But if you are looking for a diverting historical mystery, you've come to the right place."
5,False King,"What a great mind this author has. I can hardly wait for his next book. This is a must read. Outstanding and wonderfully gifted person. If you are going to read any book this year put this book and the ""Year of the Hyenas"" the top of your list."
2,"Not for clever, food-motivated dogs","My two star review is more a caution... I have two Vittle Vaults and generally love them. I do, however, have a clever (though not necessarily smart) and very food-motivated border collie mix who's figured out how to get into them. I have to give the top an extra strong twist when I close it - enough that I can barely open it. If I don't, I come home to a Vittle Vault that's been opened, a very round dog and sometimes an extra present on the floor. My other dog is not nearly as food motivated, and these work well for her."
3,I use this for brewing beer,"This is a great vessel for fermenting 10-11 gallons of beer, but the collar is not quite as air-tight as they make it sound. Still, I've brewed a dozen times using it and had great success."
5,excellent product,This is so much nicer than any other pet food container I have used. Seals tight. compact. Looks good and holds a lot more than you think it will. A very good value.
2,Don't use it outdoors,"The squirrels in my back yard were able to gnaw through the lid. Once the lid is destroyed, the product is useless. The manufacturer does not sell replacement lids."
2,misleading picture of product,I received my Vittles containers.The picture that is displayed isvery misleading. It shows 2 tubswith one being stacked on the other.This is not what you get. You only getone tub. I ordered 2 so I got what the picturehas displayed. I called Amazon and they saidthey are going to change the picture. I amalso returning the product. I am giving thisa rating of 2 because the product is nice butends up being way too expensive.
4,dont buy 40lb if you get 30-35 lb bags of food,"It does everything it promises, but if you want to use the vault in its stackable orientation, it will not hold to its specifications. I have a rottie (135lbs) who eats a ton. The large bags (35lbs) will fit in perfectly if the container is oriented lid side up. If you orient it as advertised the food will spill out."
2,Not for chewers,"I loved this container while I had it in the closet. The first day I left it available to my dogs, it was destroyed. They could not get in the top, but half of one side was chewed open. Too bad. I need a stainless or bear proof container for my beasts (lab/husky mixes - @ 50 lbs each)."
2,This won't keep rodents away.,"I thought since this was airtight that it would keep racoons, squirrels, mice from smelling the food and wanting to chew through the container. Not so. Had it full of chicken feed and out by the coop for one week, and last night something managed to chew enough to chew through the airtight gasket. If you are keeping your food indoors, probably not an issue. But don't expect it to survive outdoor critters! Even the manufacturer has an FAQ that says it won't keep out rodents (how I did not look at their website before buying this, I don't know!). [...]"
4,Container Does NOT Hold 40 lbs,"I wished I gave more credence to the few reviews that said the container rated at 40 pounds does NOT hold 40 lbs.I poured a 40 lb bag (minus a few pounds) into the container. I packed it full including right up to the lid, every bit of space was full. The container most likely could accomodate 30 to 35 lbs of dog food at most. I would highly advise to go up to the 60lb container size if you are needing to store 40 lbs."
3,Love it - but it DOES NOT hold even 30lbs of food,"We really like this container. Its low to the ground (so the kids can feed the dog unassisted), its easy to fill and seals up nicely. What I DO NOT like is that even though it says it will hold 40+ lbs of dog food - it doesn't even completely hold the 30lb bags of Nutro we buy for our dog. I would have gladly purchased the 60+lb. container (as its actually a few bucks less $) but wanted to go with a smaller size simply for convenience. Had I known it wouldn't hold a whole dog food bag - I would have been OK with the extra size of the larger one. SO be warned - if you want your container to hold an entire 30lb bag of dog food - buy the bigger one."
2,"Was nice while it lasted, too bad lids aren't replacable.","In all fairness, I've had mine for over a year, possibly two years. It was NOT kept outside, rodents did NOT tear the lid apart, but gradually over time the lid has cracked in the middle, straight through the plastic, so it's no longer airtight. This could be normal wear and tear, and that's okay, except that for the price, I would like to be able to just buy a replacement lid. Unfortunately, the manufacturer doesn't sell the lids separately, which means buying a brand new vault. $50 is kinda steep when all I really need is a lid. :("
5,PERFECT!,"We use this to store Organic Whole Grains for use in our flour mill. It keeps the grains well, and keeps out unwanted moisture."
3,Children's Book Review,"This book is out of print and therefore finding one in good condition is probably next to impossible. I purchased this book because I have a copy found at a used bookstore in excellent condition, and was hoping I could find another copy in similar shape for a friend. The copy I received was in good condition inside, but the outside was very poor. The cover was being held on by tape (not quite what I had expected).So I gave the condition of the book 3 stars overall. The book arrived in a timely manner and was a decent price...but I am not sure I will try to purchase anymore out of print books on Amazon because you never know what you will get..."
2,Only two sensors,"My 2004 Infiniti G35 sedan has 4 wear sensors in front, one for each brake pad. In this product only two of the pads have sensors, the other two have not. It may work, but you loose information on two sensors."
5,Great reliable brakes,"I have been using these brakes for many years on all of my cars ('97 Civic Coupe, '05 Scion TC, and '04 G35 Sedan) and it has been great. It definitely has a strong bite to it and I don't notice any fade or brake dust on the wheels. They also don't squeal at all until it is actually time to replace them. Definitely a product I would keep buying for years to come!"
1,DON'T BOTHER,"This is a piece of junk. It can barely keep wine cool in the winter with the heat off. The fan runs all the time no matter what. Furthermore, when the room temperature is a tad bit above 70 degrees, the light starts flashing along with a constant beeping. The only way to stop this, is to unplug it.The manufacturer offers no suggestion other than saying it's probably the pc. In my mind ""pc"" is personal computer, not microprocessor which is probably what is controlling the light flashing and beeping. The manufacturer offers no method of getting a unit which is properly working, even though they shipped the original flashing and beeping unit. They consider it yours because you, well, opened their box. This is the kind of treatment that gives a bad name to internet shopping."
3,'Pocket-sized' Dictionary,"I purchased this Portuguese/Spanish Dictionary with an Amazon.com gift certificate. Content-wise, it is what was expected from a basic dictionary. However, I was surprised with its size when I received it. When you click on the webpage to see it 'up-close' it is about twice its true size. This is not explained in its online description. I don't remember any information as to its size when I ordered it. Although the compact size is handy, the print is very small and a struggle to read if you are needing bifocals but don't have them yet (like me). I almost need to use a magnifying glass to look up anything in this dictionary and I'm only in my 40's! I am quite disappointed that the size is so small, especially for the money spent!!!"
1,"Poor clock, and ChessCentral is a poor seller","The clock works, but the display is incredibly difficult to read from an angle, which means you spend more time squinting at the readout and worrying about how much time you have left then you do playing chess. It reminds me of the very first digital watches where you couldn't quite tell if it was a zero or an eight because the middle line was sort of dimmed but not totally.Also, ChessCentral is a horrible vendor. I would never buy anything from them. I returned this clock and they only refunded me $15."
3,Decent clock for the price,"I have been playing with this clock for the last 40 or so games and it's a decent clock. Not the most intuitive design or interface, but it has merit in the basic operations of a chess clock. Don't plan on playing with this in very low light; the LCD is not backlit. I would recommend this to those who are in the market for a simple clock but who don't want to invest that much money (my phone has a free chess clock app I downloaded, which IS backlit and just as functional, although not traditional in feel or good for blitz due to its lesser tactile quality and smaller visibility)."
3,ESD Control,"I had this book when in relation to my studies in ESD control. This book however, deals more with the mathematical description of ESD protection on circuits and ESD protection in the design of circuits. It was a little bit too theoritical for my needs at that time, since I was more incline on materials dealing with EPA design and ESD management."
3,Shame,"Like the other review says, this cd is deceptive but i also think it is a shame too.... The reason i say this is that it has got some really good tracks on it, the upbeat/disco songs are cool and should have been hits in the late 70's/early 80's. The biggest disappointment though is that you never hear Whitney and she would have sounded awesome on tracks like 'think it over' and 'somebody should have told me'.Buy if u like some good, Loletta Holloway/Jocelyn Brown style disco, not if u wanna hear Whitney."
1,Plastic !,"I guess if it doesn't specify otherwise its plastic ? Perhaps your expected to look at the weight to determine whether its metal or plastic ? It also states ""Brass construction"" and ""Solid brass construction ensures quality and reliability"" but its clearly plastic with the exception of the pull-up diverter. A tad misleading."
4,If you are into the classics!,"My only ding is in graphics - even when it was a new game, i was not all that impressed. However, the gameplay is great. It's nothing like the new GTA games, except for the main concept - steal cars to complete missions and kill anybody that gets in your way! The way this game played was very different - instead of a full 3-D environment it was a 2-D birds-eye view, with you in the center. It was actually very effective, and you really didn't know what you were missing until GTA III came out.Just like in the newer games, you have to complete missions and the more you were noticed by cops, the more persistent they become. And like in the newer games, you can run over people and wreck your car, then get out and start wasting everybody with machine guns, rocket launchers, and flame throwers while getting a new ride. It is a very simple game for people with very simple taste."
2,Cameo-Parkway could have done this better!!,"What a shame! The people at ABKCO had a chance to do an excellent release but were too stupid to re-master these songs in true stereo. Reminds me of the Phil Spector box set ""Back To Mono"" that bombed out. The sound quality was a wide mix of poor to very good. Many songs had tape hiss that could have been easily removed or greatly reduced with todays technology that was readily available. This could have been a five star release if only they had taken the time to do it right."
2,I guess you had to be there....,This really only about 2 songs that stand the test of time. Twist and 96 Tears... so unless you just really have to re-live the moment I would save the money and move on.
1,Muffled tunes,"Talk about lousy mastering, this compilation would of been in better hands with either Ace UK or Bear Family!Buy it used! Get it cheap but don't spend money on this turkey of a set!"
1,Very Disappointing - Spoiler,"I was very disappointed with this novel. I loved Susan Krinard's Once A Wolf and Secret Of The Wolf so I was looking forward to this book. It was too ""preachy"" for lack of a better word. I lost whatever respect I had for Athena after she repeatedly failed to realize how much danger she was in from her brother. Morgan let her brother shoot him rather than defend himself and risk her anger. I don't know what the hell Krinard was thinking. The sanctity of life stops when the other person is trying to murder you or blackmail you into being basically enslaved."
4,Only Missing Paganini,"This version is missing the incredible Paganini, which is available if you purchase this CD directly from her website.As others have indicated this is a very lovely CD. It works particularly nice as an introductory to younger students who may know the range of the flute, or what a true virtuoso performance sounds like. This will give them some sense of what is possible (of course not by mere humans).Ms. Larson previously was the flutist with the Paul Winter group, which puts her in a rather new age vein, however this is very lovely music. Recommended for anyone who enjoys good music. There is something for everyone."
3,They are not what you would expect.,Some of the stories are funny. The stories are not your regular Scooby doo stories. There are no mystery to them.
3,Necessary Information,"As it says in the title, this book is necessary information, and it's important to understand what the author is trying to say. There are two classes of people: oppressors and liberators. The book discusses the difference between them and the importance of guarding against becoming an oppressor. There is a lot of wisdom here, but the down side of the book is that it seems to re-explain, over and over, the basic concepts in the pedagogy of the oppressed. Kind of like the instructions for using the Holy Hand Grenade in the movie, ""Monty Python and the Holy Grail"". Still, if you haven't thought about these issues, or you have and don't have a clear context for your thoughts on this matter, this book is valuable."
3,Okay book,"Good book, but somewhat boring. If you are not into Georgia history then this book will be very boring. Otherwise, it is not bad it includes very good detail about the events and is intriguing to read about this dark history of Ga's past. Great resource for history students."
3,Wait for the paperback or use the older version,"I have been waiting for an update of this classic book. However, for most health care professionals or herb users, I don't feel the $40 price tag makes this book worth it. Wait for the paperback of this updated version or get the paperback 1994 version."
3,Not too much help,"I was looking for a book about ass spelunking, and this did not cover that topic. I was dissappointed, but not surprised at all. Overall, the topic was covered pretty well, except for that it didnt cover what I WANTED."
5,A great book that shows the evolvement of fantasy writing.,"Running With the Demon has a great plot that is set out before you and evolves right under your nose until it is a great, and complex novel. This book really shows the evolvement in fantasy writings since the Lord of the Rings. An overall great novel"
4,Old themes in a new and darker setting.,"In this modern-day confrontation between good andevil, Brooks draws on many themes that his long-timereaders will instantly recognize: a young girlfaced with resisting the heritage of evil, a mancursed with the power and responsibility of tryingto change the fate of mankind, and a dark creatureof the Void who seeks to upset the balance of theworld and ultimately destroy it. All the elementsof magic that appeal to Brooks' readersare present, and his fans are unlikely to walkaway disappointed.The most unique and convincing aspect of this novel,however, is the splendidly well-drawn portrait oflife in small-town America. Nest, and her familyand friends are people I knew and recognized. Brooksonce again shows his masterful ability to capturethe elements of a collective subconscious. I foundthe bleak future he paints reminiscent of the works ofOctavia Butler. Even those who long ago gave upon Brooks' fantasy novels may want to give thisone a try."
4,Running With The Demon Review,"I recently reread this book and still find myself enjoying it as much if not more as the first time. So of the subplots and dialogue feels alittle contrived like Two Bears' speech to Nest or Derry and Junior talking about making the Union and Company see eye to eye or pay.Despite noticing more and more this flat, wooden writing, this story is still very good."
5,Fantastic! A change of pace for the better.,"On reading some of the other reviews I was sad to see the criticisms towards this great book. Like many of his other readers I have been a Terry Brooks fan for quite some time, and bought the book with expectations of Brooks' usual style. However although the writing was very different to his others, I felt that the change was like a breath of fresh air. I would think that if an author kept churning out books in exactly the same style and format time after time, eventually they would become stale and boring. Who wants a book that's predictable? I enjoyed this book immensely, and look forward to his future works. This may be a change for the moment, however I wouldn't discount his writing future books with his old style in mind. Don't be scared of change... This is what makes authors and their works interesting."
4,An interesting twist to Brooks' regular method of writing.,"I've read all of Terry Brooks' books except for A Knight of the Word. In Running with the Demon, Brooks takes his writing to a whole new level. He doesn't really bring magic into the picture except for the vaguest of times. I really liked this book but because of the lack of magical content that I have come to love, I had to give it only four stars."
2,Weak for Brooks,"Nothing great for Terry Brooks compared to his Shannara series. While the story itself was good, it was just a bit simplistic in its explanations. Brooks usually does a better job creating a world entirely different from the one we live in, so perhaps his skills truly shine when he is forced to create everything from scratch, rather than sticking his story into ""the real world""."
4,"Easy to read and follow, entertaining!","I'm an avid sci-fi/fantasy reader. This book ""Running With the Demon"" hit the spot. It's the first book by Terry Brooks that I've read and am encouraged to read more of his past works. I can't believe that I waited this long to read his work. His character building is great, I had a real feel for Nest Freemark and Pick. It was easy to read and become involved with. Good book! Could there be a second book coming? Seems that Nest and Pick still have work to do."
2,Disappointing.,"I have read every book written by Mr. Brooks, met him at one of his book signings, and await with great expectation every new book release. I have to say this was my first real disappointment. The world doesn't need another Steven King. It needs Terry Brooks. I'm sure he gets tired of the same old series and we probably would too eventually. But this was, as one person so apptly put it, ""a real snooze"". Take me to fantasyland Terry, not modern day Illinois."
1,The Reality of the Tokyo Kitchens,"In reading the reviews, K.M. Harris and T. Tanaka (Japanese residents) have got it (mostly) right. This is not the reality of the modern Japanese diet, it is a look at traditional dietary habits. I disagree with reviewer Harris that Japanese genetics are the whole story - there is an increase in body fat and weight gain as reported by T. Tanaka and an increase in chronic diseases. These changes are in line with dramatic changes to the Japanese diet in a short period of time so it is indeed quite evident that nutrition can influence genes.For a more useful overview of the changing Japanese diet and the differences between Western diets and that of Japan, see the excellent new book by Logan - The Brain Diet. This book is based on the realities of the Japanese diet and includes more practical ways to take advantage of the best components of the Japanese diet for health promotion."
3,Plant history,"I have to admit, I was a little disappointed in this book; I was hoping more plants were included. The information that was included was very informative."
4,Kindle book,I got this for my kindle. I have not had the opportunity to read through this book as of ye
2,Nice and heavy but nonstick coating is coming off,"I've owned this for about a year and use it infrequently. After about six months, the nonstick coating began to flake off. It's almost all gone from the sharp end and has even started to come off the center of the flat round top. Concerned about getting bits of coating into my steaks and chicken breast so I won't be using this anymore. You get what you pay for, unfortunately."
2,haven't used it yet but . . .,Yoy need something like a chain saw to get into this absurd packaging!!! I thought I heard amazon was cutting down on wasteful clam shell packaging!!!
4,"Fun, but hard to master","I bought this for my 9 year old for Christmas. He has had a great time playing with it. It took him several hours to be able to get this toy to do a loop around the living room before crashing but he had fun learning it.This toy has crashed into walls, the Christmas tree, curtains, and cupboards and it is still working. Not bad for something made out of Styrofoam.As a warning to parents and those with pets, the wings are loud. It terrifies our dogs and is annoying when you are trying to watch TV or listen to the radio.This is a good gift for those in love with flying but since it is difficult to master keeping it in the air, you may want think twice if it is for someone with a low frustration threshold."
4,I recommend this toy.,My son received this toy as a gift. It was so much fun that my other son (age 13) bought one as well. THey had a lot of fun playing with it inside but more difficult to steer inside and crashes more - hasn't broken yet. Much easier to fly in a big room or gym. They have not played with it outside yet due to the snow on the ground. Overall good toy.
1,sorely disappointed,"exceptionally poor photography...many photos appear to be cut and pasted from other publications, cheap paper...value guide is a joke...immediately returned for refund."
4,High level stuff for a new or future entrepeneur,"I enjoyed this book. It gives you a lot of things to think about at a very high level. It is, after all, just an introductory book.... you wont be a CPA after reading it!!! Well laid out, nice short concise non-boring chapters with a consistent example throughout."
4,Great for motivation; you'll need more to become a pro,"If this book doesn't motivate you to at least think about becoming a professional blackjack player, nothing will. It is great for beginners. Revere nicely outlines the principles underlying the reason you can get an edge in blackjack, and the difference between blackjack and other casino games like roulette and craps. The book also teaches you how to count.Main weakness is the betting strategy.I thought this was the best blackjack book I ever read, until I read ""The Ultimate Edge."" (They are very different; Revere's book is a ""How-To"" book, and The Ultimate Edge is a ""here's what they did"" book.Previous reviewers critiques are valid: bad grammar, sexist, and dated. Still, it provides great motivation. well worth reading."
2,no information on what is on the dvd.,"i don't know if i would get this item, cause there is no information on this item. what is on this?"
2,Of very little use,"This book when first published was not that great, being most a list of what cards were available. If you wish to start an Access database for Magic, this book is useful, but is of very little use otherwise. This book doesn't even include ALLIANCES!!!"
3,Passing grade.,"This movie was a disappointment. It seems to tell the story OK but it lacks something.I remember that a history channel showed a movie titled ""Enola Gay"" starring Billy Crystal,but I have never been able to find it. It was a far superior movie to this one."
4,Check It!@#$%^&*,"YOu got to check the sound ""blow your mind"", this ish really blows your mind. The album as a whole is not as great as their first album, there style is a bit slower, but their lyrics are ill""The Uncontrollable Full Force Crew Representin the BBOY nation"""
3,a decent video camera for the size and price,"The various listings on amazon for the dxg 506 are all the same cameras.The only difference is the colors be it black, blue, silver, or pinkso the reviews that purtain to one of them would apply to all of them.If you want a low priced video recorder that will fit in your pocket, store on an SD card, and use AA batteries this would fit that bill.Aside from the weak low light performance the worst thing I've foundon the camera is the lens cap tends to fall off. There is some hiss onthe audio unless you have plenty of input volume."
3,good,"light time fantasy reading, good ending twist, character development weak , not up to the standards of ""outlander"" but better than harlequin or lovesweapt series books."
1,Don't buy! Waste of money!,"I bought this for my son's birthday in December. From the beginning, it had trouble playing DVDs - new ones at that. It would take several tries at loading them before they would finally play. Only a month after I bought it, it began not playing some DVDs at all, until finally, seven months later, it won't play any at all. This was a complete waste of money."
1,Waste of money,"I studied this book before the ASCP exam for lab management diplomat. The book says it is a ""study guide"" for the exam. The exam and the book are compleat different, nothing in the book was on the exam. Do not waste your money."
4,He's got this sexy personna that makes him all that...,"My favorite song on the cd is track 7: I know. This is 100% sexy and Ginuwine's voice is maximum. It is a good example of this man's talents vocally. Other songs I like are: What's so Different, which contains the artist Timberland, my other favorite male artist; it is so seductive at the end, and I just love the Micheal Jackson sounds...So Anxious, another example of the handsome man's singing talent...Wait a Minute, which reveals how the man in the relationship sometimes may feel...lastly, the phone call duet with Aaliah is very funny, and the bangin beat is modeled after her hit, Are You That Somebody."
3,"looked nice, but didn't fit","It was indicated by a vendor that this fit on 4"" partitions, but would only fit on something under 3"". There is the option to wall mount, but we didn't want to screw into the wall. It looked nice and sturdy though."
3,Product probably works fine - DO NOT USE ON EDIBLE PLANTS,Product description did not note it was not for edible plants. I had intended to use this for our herb garden that we brought in for the winter. Fortunately I read through all the instructions. Eventually we returned and just put the plants outside to go dormant.
2,Not great for low water volume indoor plants. Better to use spray.,"I have 4' Majesty Palms that don't consume a lot of water, so this was not such a great choice. Systemic poison requires more watering than these plants require. It was ineffective entirely on mealy bugs. I recommend using a spray instead. A natural alternative is a good idea, as well, as it leaves more options if the treatment doesn't work. Thanks."
4,Gorgeous.,I've had bad exeriences with Manic Panic dyes before but this color is beautiful. If you want it really bright you'll at least need to have light blonde hair though. Tip: To keep color from fading easily wash your hair with cold water and mix a tiny bit of leftover dye in with your conditioner. I plan on getting this color again =D
4,Good News,"This recording presents new pieces that are very difficult to play and to find in other recordings. I was acquainted to Mr. Thalberg through this recording. This recording has some special points to be considered : 1st - If you don't know Thalberg, buy it.... 2nd - There is a Webern piece that is very good too.Liszt's Benediction de Dieu dans La Solitud has a beautifull sound here.But, if you are trying to find something of good taste, try others... This CD is a show of great technical skills achieved."
4,Pretty good coffee,"On my search for the ""perfect"" coffee, this one comes pretty close. It's not bitter even when made very strong. However, if it was just a little bit darker, it would be ideal."
2,Catch the good parts on u tube,I was pretty dissapointed with this purchase. For being as long as it was I expected it to be more in depth. There was nothing on here I haven't seen before and I've actually seen better stuff on u tube as well as the best parts of this one. Don't waste your money.
5,Too much fun!,This is an awesome addition to the Frigits basic pack. We also have the extensions that allow you to go around corners. Everyone has to touch these cool magnets when they see them!One thing: move the corner parts when not using or they will fall off when you open the fridge ;)
5,Teachers and parents....don't miss this book !,"This is an awesome book about a boy that receives a service dog. I am a puppy raiser for potential service dogs, and go into elementary schools to give talks to children about service dogs.I live in a rural area where service teams are rarely seen...so I have the teacher read this book to the class before I go. It gives great insight into the world of disabled children, and perfectly sets the stage for me to give my presentation. I can't praise this thoughtfully written book enough...great for children of all ages !"
1,Many Glaring Omissions - Keep looking,"If you are a sysadmin who is just getting started with Solaris, then this would be a very poor choice. Basic network setup help (DNS, IP services) are nowhere to be found, and that's just the beginning. The author appeared to have little idea of what the target audience would need.Another shoddy manual with the Sun logo on it. I've been burned twice now: there won't be a third time."
3,defines the perception of a child,"Little man, little man, actually took me a while to read. The language in the book can be confusing and often times the reader is unaware of what the author (James Baldwin) is talking about. The book does get better as it progesses and the end is somewhat suprising...I promise. I recommend reading this book for leisure and not for a book report (you would have a hard time writing about it). Hope I helped."
3,A good supplement,"This book is basically made up of stories that didn't make an earlier anthology. The first four do a nice job in elaborating on the integration of Grantsville into the 1639s. However, the technical article on radios seemed like padding and was something only a tech could read, nevertheless enjoy."
2,Broke after two years,"I bought one of these in December, 2008. It worked okay. Recently, about two years later, I found that one of the steel 'loops' had broken, near the tip. It can no longer be used for most tasks, because the broken part catches on food and rips it (e.g., pancakes) or pushes food away instead of slipping under it. I don't know what circumstance caused the steel to break. I didn't notice when it happened. The turner has not been used for any unusual activity (e.g., turning screws), has not been used especially hard, or under extreme conditions. I didn't use it for blacksmithing, or heavy duty restaurant work. This thing must be made of very poor quality steel. It gets two stars because it arrived in good condition, and functioned as it should for a couple of years, but two years is too short a lifetime for a simple tool in light use. NOT recommended."
4,Good Value...,It is a good value but I didn't realize the size was a bit smaller than I wanted. I still may buy a larger one.
1,Mission aborted,"Techno junk food with some Rap/R+B influences. Amazing how a 5 minute song can seem like 8 minutes, when the majority is ust the same, repetitive hip-hop rhythm scheme."
1,Dont buy,"please, dont buy this album. at this point, i have to say that ""sundown to sunrise"" is quite bad. it is soft, boring and irrelevant to the extreme. dont listen to the other reviews. every song on this album sounds the same. this is especially sad because the debut album from vivid, ""go!"" was quite an exciting, energetic record. buy that one instead."
5,Wonderful overview,"Mr. Bodio has written an outstanding overview of modern falconry. He manages to convey what it is about falconry that makes falconers put up with the heartache of hunting with raptors. As a bonus, Mr. Bodio's writing is a joy to read. It is both funny and informative. This is definitely *not* a how-to book, but instead gives a good overview of what falconry is like, and what a prospective falconer can expect."
1,"Dark, Largely Boring And Depressing","Photography buffs or fans of Aikido might enjoy this one, but I didn't. I waited patiently throughout the story for something to spark my interest, but it never came along. The plot line just wasn't strong enough to overcome the frequent and largely boring excursions into photography and the dojo. The overall tone was dark and depressing. As with the main character's inability to see colors, this was a black and white story without interesting contrasts."
3,second place,"This book was not as good as the first one(the magican's Tale). Somehow, the characters weren't as vivid and the plot moved slower. Having said that, I enoyed the book and would read others with the same characters."
3,handle with care,"Apparently these earbuds are very fragile, because they stopped working about a month or so after I received them. I never dropped or stepped on them. I guess I got my money's worth, since they're so cheap."
3,predictable.,"This book started out well, but was very predictable. It reads a little like a mystery investigation, but was too predictable to keep me interested."
3,Dissappointed,I just wanted to comment on the fact the John Lennon's Starting Over (Just like) is not included in the sound track. It gave a warm fuzzy to the start of the movie and added to the humor of what was going on on screen.
3,it gets so old.,"i liked this deck while i was in great need of having really gentle, non-forceful messages. After that, i realized how horribly wishy-washy and touchy-feely it is. The art isn't that good, the interpretations aren't that good, but the information on herbs is great. If only it were a bit less new-agey, i think this deck could be something great."
4,"The game was great, NFL Films could have done better","Having grown up with the AFL in the late 60's, hearing Curt Gowdy's call of this game is a great way to relive those fall Sunday afternoons. My only complaint is NFL Films' production of the video could have been better. Since Curt Gowdy's calls were recreated, the calls sometimes give away what happens next. Also, when Gowdy is talking about Unitas as ""one of the greats"" they show a close-up of Earl Morral. Finally, the fake crowd noise was distracting. Minor points, but enough to stop me from giving it five stars. On a positive note, this approach to the game, showing most all of the plays in sequence, is a lot better than the typical highlight video."
1,Very poor formatting,"Apparently the book was scanned, then via software converted to the Kindle book. No editing for obvious bad characters. Page numbers, book title, footnotes, whatever is on the page besides the text shows embedded on the page. Book is readable if one simply tries to ignore all the extra ""garbage"" material. This review applies to six of the G Campbell Morgan Kindle books I purchased, probably applies to all of them."
1,Use Gel,"I used this product(from a local hardware) side by side with gel - on the same day, same plants, same soil, same lights, etc. Nothing Different! The results from the gel so outstripped the powder that I don't know why the powder is even on the market anymore. Maybe because some of us haven't tried or compared yet? Get a gel like rootech. The extra cost is worth it. It goes farther than you'd think and though I've heard the gel has an expiration date mine has been just as effective after two months of use, dirt dropped in it, ashes, and whatnot. This isn't as detailed and pretty as some comparitive reviews, but I compared and there was no contest."
3,Trying to get it to work??..for Win98SE OS..,"I finally got a response from company's site and not check it out yet,nevertheless the product features and specifications are appealing for what I need from this product..keep getting error messages like service connection failed;refresh device history failed;refresh failed and I will see the email for the help I need from the Company's site and I would eventually have an answer for my problems..."
4,Marticha,I read the book Marticha was a great book. I thought the story was the best. It really put me in her place. I loved this book and I hope that many kids read this in the future. Marticha was a very touching story. While reading the book I realized she was luckier than most African American people.
5,T.U.G is back,TUG has proven that it can with stand the B2K drama with O'Ryan's debut. This young artist proves that he is mature beyond his years and his brother's spotlight. He is a star in his own write. Of couse my favorite song is Introducing (go young rome) and 45 min.Congratulations O'Ryan for making a great debut.
5,Hot 4Real!!!!!,"O'Ryan's cd is off the chain. I love almost every song, it's hot no lie. I recommend this cd to everyone. If you like fast song's slow song's or just hot song's period this is the cd for you. I promise you'll love it!!!! So what are you waiting on? Go get it!"
5,OFF DA HOOK!,"Ladies, if you wanna feel good anytime, pop in this CD. It's a beutiful mix of R&B and Hip Hop! It's 4 da fellas if ya'll wanna get ya gurl in da mood for anything. Ladies, you will fall in love with O'Ryan, it's one of the best CD's ever."
5,Not A Surprise!!!!!!!!!!,"O'ryan Grandberry is your Dream Boy. The type of guy you wish you had, and on his self titled album it only takes those little things into overdrive. With his hit songs like ""Take it Slow"" and ""Shorty"", O'ryan makes it clear that he doesn't wanna rush a girl into anything she's not ready for, but he wants to bump and grind on the dance floor. Throughout this album, O'ryan displays his talented voice and young seducing style. At the young age of 17 this playboy will be seen all over...~Deaota aka Dee Dee"
3,Like Camilla's Hats,"Those who understand and appreciate the current trend in British millinary -- like the hats worn by Camilla -- will enjoy THE NEW CURTAIN BOOK by Stephanie Hoppen. Others, who prefer the John Fowler tradition of curtain making, will find it in shocking bad taste. The designers are mostly British, but there are some from the U.S. as well. It is an attractive book, but not necessarily the learning tool as the title might suggest. Recommended only for those who are really looking for something different, regardless."
5,Humor & Enlightenment,"Having known Dr. Campo for many years, I can honestly say this book is written with his sense of humor and insight into the human heart. Dr. Campo is a sensitive soul & his book relfects his love for his family & his patients. Anyone can benefit from reading Forgiving Dad.....for everyone has someone who deserves forgiveness."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"The Parafaith War is about a pretty pointless war between two societies, because of different culture and religion.A young soldier on one side has a hard time because he seems a bit too much like the other. He is one man that realises that it definitely is pointless, and he wants to find a solution that doesn't involve war."
4,Compelling Story,"One of Mr. Modesitt's more ambitous novels...this one explores the meaning/impact of war in and on human society and the individual. It contrasts two human societies operating from opposing frames of reference. I enjoyed the novel..and unlike alot of scifi today it does raise questions that stay with the reader. However, Mr. Modesitt fails to give the opposing culture ""Revs"" sufficent depth, esp. when the hero travel to the home planet. And the entire question of the Meaning of War is wrapped up a little to neatly. Still a worth buying."
5,A Must Have Title,"A great well exposed piece of research. The abuse and lies of the US Gov't under George W. Bush and his cronies is beyond comprehension. This book clearly identifies what a inside out, upside down world we suffer under today. This is a must have investigation that should be in every library- personal and public."
3,"You read stuff here you don't read anywhere else, but...","you get the idea that something is being left out of the family portrait, maybe the crazy aunt in the attic. When I read that Larry Franklin had passed classified documents to ""lobbyists,"" I realized that the omission is deliberate. Franklin passed classified documents to American Israel Public Affairs Committee. He was spying for Israel. You'd think that, in a book largely about what drives American foreign policy, Palast would mention the influence of Israel. You would think that in a book which talks a lot about neocons there would be a passing mention of Israel. There's not even an entry for Israel in the index.According to Palast, neocons just love oil, privatized oil. That's what they get up for in the morning. Israel who?"
2,not for sweet potatoes,"I bought this for aking french fries and sweet potato fries. It makes pretty good waffle fries using white potatoes but it doesn't cut a sweet potato at all. I had to get my boyfriend to try to push the sweet potato through (he's a muscular guy), and he had trouble. I abandoned the ""food holder/grip"" altogether. It's a joke. Needless to say I sliced my hand. Wont do that again. Like pervious users said, I am often left with unused portions of vegetables that I end up cutting with a knife (defeating the purpose of the mandoline). i love Oxo but this product doeasn't make sense. I am most disappointed with the food holder. it's good for a cucumber....that's about it."
1,Brand new: blade very dull,"I bought this several months ago, to replace my old, cheap V-slicer. I've always wanted a pro-type mandoline. I didn't have a need for it until last night and was sorely disappointed when trying to slice an onion. I thought I was doing something wrong as the onion shredded. When I examined the blade I found it very dull (and yes, I did remove the protective plastic). I would return it, but I bought it so long ago I am beyond any grace period they might give me. This review is the only satisfaction I can get. I'm going back to my old $20 V-slicer, if I can find it. Not recommended."
1,"Not sharp. Straight blade chops, not slice","I was so excited ot use this product as I make pickles a few times a year. This review is only for chopping cucumbers, so I don't know how well it works for other purposes. For cucumbers, it just plain sucks. The straight blade is not only too dull to cleanly cut cukes into chips (it tears the skin on the backside of the chip), it take a considerable amount of effort to just push it through the blade. It's also a bad design. The blade should be angled across the machine so it slices as well as chops.Returning it today to Crate and Barrel."
1,Food pusher well not deep enough,"Looking for a replacement for my worn Borner mandoline, I gave this OXO mandoline a try. I have used mandolines for 20 years and wouldn't be without one. However, the OXO mandoline was disappointing. The well on the food pusher isn't deep enough to hold the vegetables firmly and it was not a smooth operation. I'm ordering a Borner."
1,"Not sharp, not useful","This product is not terribly useful, because it is not sharp. At all. And there is no way to sharpen it - maybe the flat blade could be sharpened (I honed it a bit which helped), but the julienne blades cannot be sharpened and are therefore mostly useless. The only thing this can successfully cut is potatoes (and it does a pretty good job at that). Anything else just doesn't work. It even has a hard time with onions. You can forget about slicing bell peppers or tomatoes with this.This was the first mandoline I've ever tried, so I don't know if this is universal to mandolines or if this is just an exceptionally bad product. I don't see why they didn't just make all the blades razor-sharp; that would have made this a really great product. For now I'll have to stick with a chef's knife for anything but potatoes."
1,Doesn't live up to OXO reputation,"So disappointed in OXO, this is an expensive item that doesn't live up to it's name. I owned this and recently threw it away, that's how POOR it is! (didn't buy it from Amazon) The blade is so dull that you end up wasting half of your fruits and veggies and there is no way of sharpening. Also the safety holder does not ""hold"" the items, so you have to use your hands,needless to say I've had a few experiences involving bandages!! Don't waste your $$ on this item."
1,Not as seen on TV,"Bought this for Mom since she saw it on TV and wanted one for herself. Having read the amazon reviews I tried to convince her to try a different brand but it looked so easy for the chefs that she wanted to try it anyway. Needless to say, she couldn't slice even one thing faster or easier than she could with her favorite kitchen knife and we returned it promptly. Save your time and money."
2,Boy what a disappointment!!,"Boy what a disappointment!! Do not waste your money.I've had this OXO mandoline about 2 months after being recommended at Williams Sonoma. I agree with many of the negative reviews here. I have one BIG COMPLAINT. The holder grabs a lot of whatever you are cutting, leaving huge chunks of leftover potato, cucumber, carrot or whatever. You can end up wasting i5-20% of your vegetables.I intend to buy a Boerner V-slicer. The Amazon reviews are much better for it."
4,Spectacular,"This book, Shattering Glass, was an okay book. I've read books just like it and i've seen movies with the same plot so it really didnt have any flavor of it's own. You should still read it because it teaches kids in high school a little something about reality and respect and to be yourself."
4,Suspensful Thriller,"Shattering Glass by Gail Giles is a suspenseful thriller about a high school clique that wants to make the class goof into the class favorite. The story is narrated by one of the boys from the clique, straight A student, Young Stewart. Stewart tells of how they transform Simon Glass from class loser to class favorite. Simon gets too caught up in his quest for popularity and is no longer liked by the clique. They take it upon themselves to straighten Glass out. I found this book to be enlightening of how some high school kids can really get caught up in the race for popularity. I enjoyed this book a lot and would recommend it to anyone who likes suspenseful books with twisted and disturbing endings."
3,Shattering Glass,"I liked and disliked this book. I liked and disliked it because there was alot of foul language, but the book kept me wanting to read to see what was going to happen. The book is about a group of high school seniors,who want to make the class geek into the most popular kid in school. And through some challenges they succeed, but unfortunate things seem to happen through out the book to some of the guys in the group, and because of that there is a surprise ending."
2,Wouldn't buy if I had it to do over,"I bought this because I have a bad hip and wanted convenient, low impact exercise. Also wanted to use it under desk at work.The bad: The motion is jerky. Can't type and pedal at the same time--have to hold onto chair in order to make motion smoother. Definitely not good for office. Tension adjustment makes little difference except to make it noisier and jerkier. One of the rubber feet keeps working itself off. Dislike that the pedal strap has to be adjusted with a screwdriver--what a pain to change it for different size shoes!The good: Fully assembled, except you have to insert the batteries. Booklet is clear on how to do it. Fairly lightweight and easy for a old lady with a bum hip to carry. Sturdy construction. While there is probably no cardio benefit with this, if you need to keep your joints moving while you're watching TV at home, it's probably okay for that.I gave it only 2 stars because I think it is too expensive for something that doesn't work that well."
2,Too obvious.,"This book is nothing like Twilight. I found it on a booklist for Twilight read-alikes, and I understand why it was included, I'm just saying - it's not like Twilight. In fact, if you didn't like Twilight, you may like this book. The protagonist is as full of self-confidance as Bella is full of self-doubt. Whereas Bella's relationship with her family is peripheral, Viviane is surrounded by family. She's part of a pack after all. She's a werewolf. In the end Viviane's dilemna is not far from Bella's; she wishes she could have a friend outside the pack. The theme is a perennial favorite with young adult fiction - finding where you fit in outside the stifling structure of one's family. I didn't like this one because it's too transparent. Too obvious. The angst is spelled out too clearly."
4,"""Blood and Chocolate"" Great name!",This book was awesome. I would actually rate it 4 1/2 stars but I cant. This book is really weird though. You really have to pay attention b/c there are a lot of characters. It is so awesome and the end is so suprising!
5,To Cool!,"This book is very exciting; it kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time I was reading it. It has an understandable plot, and is about a girl that everyone can relate to. Caught between two worlds, Vivian tries desperately to fit in. She doesn't find herself able to relate to her family, but she isn't very popular at school, either. There is some bad language, but it fits the plot. This wouldn't be very good if you are sensitive to bad language, but over all this story is thrilling and is sure to please anyone!"
4,Really adult for a YA novel,"Vivian loves being a werewolf but she doesn't like having to hide what she is from humans. She also isn't too happy with the boys her age in the pack so she begins dating a human. Aiden is respectful of her and he is interested in the occult. Vivian begins to hope that she can trust him with her secret. Meanwhile, the pack is in disarray while they battle it out over the position of leader. While this continues no wolf or human is safe, including Aiden.This book was very different from a lot of YA books I've read. The author does a really good job of writing the animalistic side of Vivian's personality. It was also petty adult for a YA book as the sex and violence aren't too watered down. People who are looking for fluffy romance with supernatural bits thrown in are going to be disappointed. However, if you like good werewolf books this one shouldn't be missed."
5,IT IS SO COOL!,"It's it a mix of a love story and a vampire Thriller!It's reall great.I love the Character Vivian a tennaged-vampire who falls in love with a human or should I say a ""meat-boy""!Its a great book!"
4,Enticing and seductive...,"This is a great story about humanity and what it means to be different. Vivian and her pack are werewolves, they look like humans, but can shift to wolf at will. A. Klause characterizes werewolves as something different than they are normally though to be. This was such a good book about love and sacrifice. I must say that the end was shocking, and a little disapointing. But even so, all young adults should read this book. The author's amazing writing technique and story ideas spin a web of magic around this book."
5,"""Blood and Chocolate""","The book ""Blood and Chocolate"" is the best book I have ever read, in a scale from 1-10 i would definitly give it a 10 because it involves mystery, danger and romance it is a book that will captivate you since you open it. The authors use of detail and diction is so important it gives life to the book, Annette Curtis Klause uses such vivid language that the readers will live each second of it and enjoy it until the end and you will want to read it again and again. If you liked this book you will also like to read ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""The Wren and the Lark"" because they also involve mystery and romance.I encourage you to read this interesting and captivating book, you will have a great time and enjoy the time you spend reading this book."
5,It's one of those books you stay up all night reading.,"I thought the book was very original and real. I stayed up reading it all night, I just couldn't stop!!! I think it's great for people who like to read original and unique stories. I think people who liked this book should also check out Mr. Was by Pete Hautman."
4,"Good, but a bit violent","Maybe now that Oz has left Willow on ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", he'll join up with Viv in this novel that makes adolescense look almost as horrific as that other teen phenom."
4,Full of facts,This is a good book if you just want the facts and can memorize like that. I need a story to go along with the facts so it didn't really help me all that much. However if that is what you are looking for it is a very small just the facts book with not pictures to distract you.
1,Very negative children's book,"It has a cute title and is drawn nicely, but the first 28 or so pages are very dark and negative. Rocky has to move into a new home, one with kids and 5 cats. The children are referred to as ""little monsters."" True, they do mean things to the dog, but referring to kids as ""little monsters"" in a children's book just seems wrong. The 5 cats also do mean things to the dog, like tearing up all his toys he brought from his old home. Things come to a head about 3/4 through the book when the kids are being particularly cruel to all the animals. Rocky saves the day, and the cats are nice for the last 4 or so pages. However, this proves small consolation for having read through the first part. As I was reading it to my kids, I thought this had to get better, but on the whole, I don't believe this is suitable for children."
1,Why is this book still around?,Just a predecessor to Make the Most of Your Money and just as bad.You can skip this one.
4,Review of Xbox Spherex 51000,"Great sound system!Well built and designed by engineers for the ""user."" One particular feature that demonstrates its design quality is the absence of speaker ""boom."" When powering up the system, after inadvertently leaving the volume on high, the volume automatically begins at a low setting and slowly steps up to its last setting to prevent speaker damage. The remote is well built with many personalization settings to taylor the sound.The price is reasonable and I can't imagine any buyer being disappointed."
4,Very cute,"This is a cute book with pictures of dogs doing funny things. Each page has a picture of a different dog. Perfect for a rainy day or if you don't feel like reading, just want to look at pictures. Could be used for many different things, even could be used to give you ideas for stories."
4,Polk Audio SA2 RM satellite speaker stands Titanium finish,"I like the appearance and built of these stands-very sturdy. Also, it compliments the color of my Sony 60-inch TV. The only thing I didn't like is that the stand tube doesn't rotate on it's own if you want the speaker aimed at a certain angle, you will have to move the base as well. Also, my speakers RM10 which just hooks onto it is pretty quick and easy. However, the speaker-adaptor is made of plastic which I thought should've been metal or something more solid to hold the speakers but maybe, it's just me coz it's very minor. Overall, I recommend it"
4,heavy progressive and very classical,"I havent listened to royal hunt in a long time, but i was looking on Amazon.com and i came across this,I noticed that John West was doing lead vocals and already knowing of his brilliant voice with Artension I decided to give this a go. I have played this around 4 times since getting it 2 days ago and i realy like it. The music is heavy progressive and very classical and the vocals are great. Get this CD its great value and runs for close to 70 minutes long ."
1,Don't bother ordering!,"I ordered it as a replacement bulb for my burned out garage door light since NOBODY local had it. It came broken - not surprising, since it was put in a big box with no packing material at all! Are these people crazy? It wasted my time waiting for it and then having to send it back. Earlier reviews had complained about this product, so I guess I should have believed them, but I was desperate!Well, after sending it back, I had to give up and buy a whole new fixture! Much more expensive, but no choice. I will say that Amazon was very good about crediting me for it promptly, as they've been on a couple of other purchases that didn't show up as promised. Amazon should no longer carry this vendor for this product.BTW, I only gave it one star as it wouldn't let me give 0 stars!"
2,Edmund Burke: A Genius Reconsidered,This book is not an autobiography. it goes back and forth between papers he wrote. I was looking for asimple well laid out thoughts and how he came to form these ideas.
4,"Like it, but the open back is a little weird","When I ordered these wall pockets, I did not fully grasp that there basically no back panel, just a little plastic around the back edge so that you can mount the screws into the wall. As a result, I find I have to think about it rather more than I would like, in order to not ding the wall with clipboards or smudge it with wet ink, that sort of thing. So they are a little less than ideal. Still, they are great for managing piles of receipts and other smaller papers and seeing what it is you have on hand."
4,Fergus-Thompson plays Bach Transcriptions,"This CD shows a great aspect of the playing of Mr. Fergus-Thompson. Although the pianist tends to over-romanticize some passages he does show an often-neglected aspect of Bach's music: it humanity. The interpretations are less virtuosic than a virtually similar recording by Alexis Weissenberg in the 1970's (which EMI ought to release as CD). The approach is reminiscent of Edwin Fischer. One problem with this release is the horrible, clunky sound of the instrument used. Steinway could certainly do better. Mr. Fergus-Thompson would have been better served by a Bosendorfer."
3,"Ehhhh, it's alright.","I bought this conditioner because of the way it smelled in the bottle, frankly. Once I used it, the smell was actually really overpowering and took on a different, more spicy smell that I didn't like as much as the way it smelled in the bottle. It also didn't do much for my hair. It left almost a waxy feeling on it that I didn't care for. I much prefer Biolage Hydratherapie Detangling Solution, which is by and far the best conditioner I've ever used. Bah. I'll probably pawn this off on one of my friends."
1,DO NOT BUY! This is a piece of junk!,"Please believe the people who said this was a piece of junk. I didn't and ordered it anyways. We finally put the batteries in and it will not let you enter the codes on the slides. All it says is ""Pick a slide and enter it's code"". Very, Very annoying and disappointing for the kid. DO NOT BUY THIS!"
4,Fun Microscope for small kids,I bought this for my 5 year old son who is really into bugs and science. He loves looking at the slides. We are having trouble typing in the code and getting the microscope to recognize the slide and begin asking questions etc...but he still has fun looking at the slides and talking about what he sees. I gave it a lower review on fun because it fails to hold his attention due to the fact we can't get the machine's talking portion to ask him questions.
3,Buttons don't work from get go,"This really IS a very cool toy. But today is the first time we used it and already the buttons don't work properly. I am going to write the company. In theory if this toy worked as it should I would give it kudos all around. The slides are durable and seem safe enough. The pictures are good and you can, like with any microscope adjust the clarity. There is a volume control on ours so that is also adjustable. It is just getting the buttons to work that is frustrating. From the get go they had my son frustrated and he gave up after a few minutes and walked away. While it was working however, he was facinated with the facts about the bugs. He still has a little trouble keeping one eye closed while looking into the view finder though. (He's 5) I will update this if the company helps us out by replacing the item with one where the buttons work better."
1,"Cheaply made, fun toy",My son adored this toy and showed it off to everyone. Then the buttons stopped working after a week. He is so sad that it lasted such a short amount of time.
4,doesn't magnify,"This is a great product for a beginner. My 6 yr old really likes it. It does not however magnify anything. The slides are just magnified pictures of bugs and insects. The facts and quizzes are good, but it does just ask and say the same things over and over. Again, it's good for a trial microscope to see if your child is really going to be into one."
4,Fun for a while..,"This microscope is great at first but once you've looked at the same 12 slides a dozen times and heard the same facts over and over, it's not much fun anymore. My son really enjoyed it at first but now is bored with it. I really wish it came with more slides you could buy. We haven't had any trouble with it reading codes or anything, works great. Will be a nice toy to pass on to another kid...."
4,Tremendous Music!,"""Sleigh Ride"" was a number I did when I was in my high school band. We always enjoyed playing the song, now I get to relive that moment by playing it on this CD. This is a good CD for some ""background"" Christmas music you will play throughout your home. Enjoy!"
4,The Pacific,"If you're into seeing things how they really were this is the series for you. Was pretty graphic but told the story well. If you liked ""Band of Brothers"" chances are you like this series."
3,No 'B.o.B.' but still a must-watch,"Much more historically-minded than 'Band of Brothers', the Pacific effectively gives any history buff perhaps more than he was expecting.NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH! Some nudity/sexuality and much worse in terms of violence and gore than 'B.o.B' !!!!!After watching Pacific, I was compelled to return BoB to my DVD player for a comparison. BoB, in my conclusion, is a far more entertaining narrative and gives more artistic liberties than Pac, which is more documentary-style and flows closer to real-life than BoB. Character development was a little shallow in Pac. as there are simply too many characters to follow to get to know them very well. However, any fan of war documentaries will find the day-to-day of these Pacific marines well-researched and fascinating! A must see!!!!"
4,Very similar to Band of Brothers,"I like the show so far, it has alot of action and whatnot but it is lacking a connection to me, before in band of brothers there was a connection to the enemy and you got to understand them more, but with the Japanese you dont get to see much, maybe that is apart of the story because it was gorilla warfare.... still great though, same thing just a different place from Band of Brothers though"
5,War at its finest,I bought this cuz Tom Hanks and Steven Spielburg did an excellent job filming Band Of Brothers. So when I saw them filming The Pacific I just had to get it. I would recommend this to anyone that is a war fan out there 5 out of 5 good job HBO.
5,"Personal feelings of ""THE PACIFIC""!","After viewing The Pacific, my Brother in Law was a member of the 3rd Division and landed on Iwo, I have to say I have no problem with the dropping of ""THE BOMB"" on The two Japanese city's. The series followed the true march of the US Marine's thru the Pacific very close. My regret is so many fine young Marine's lost their live's in the march across the Pacific to defeat Japan."
1,Dont get this series,I have watched this series and it is terrible. From the begining you are told nothing so you do not know really much about what is going on except which they are on. My dad is a former Marine and also cant watch this movie. Another example of this being so bad is the Marines look like slobs and not Marines! Compared to band of brothers there is no comparison. Lastly the core is not made up of one or two Marines but of many Marines. I would not recommend this to anybody!
2,Skip it- you aren't missing anything,"Really tough to watch hours upon hours of mindless nonsense and then it ends with a fizzle. Reminds me of ""Shock and Awe"" when we all sat glue to hours of TV and watched, well NOTHING happen. Winds of War had more going on than this. With no real character development, substandard acting and chopped up storylines, most of the film is dribble that you must get through to watch the next battle. It was visually stunning and the battles were intense, however short and rare. I say skip it, you aren't missing anything.And yes, BOB set a standard that others must put more effort into if they want to succeed."
5,Great transaction,"Fast Transaction, i received it in a condition not exactly advertised but received a full refund and kept the product. The company was sincere and apologetic for and strives for a good reputation, and they deserve it. I will be buying it from them great customer service and satisfaction guaranteed"
3,not another band of brothers,"I bought this movie set because I have band of brothers and I wanted to more or less get this movie as a companion set. I was slightly dissappointed after watching all the movie, guess maybe I was expecting it to be as good or better then B.o.B., as with world war 2 both theaters of operation were diffent, same with these movies. I just could not relate to the characters in ""Pacific"" seemed as if it jumped around to much, people came and went, guess maybe thats how it was with soldiers getting wounded or killed too. I never could figure out who was who. Enough of that. As for the end of the movie I think it could have ended a little different, maybe show the men coming home and the readjustments they had to make after going through hell. The movie just ended like this review..........."
3,It was OK,"In all, the series was good. However, I don't think it measures up to the bar that was set by Band of Brothers. They substituted further exploration of characters with extra helpings of explosions, violence, and sex. In all, the acting is fairly good and the story gives you the feeling of how these folks endured the war."
3,My opinion.....,"I was looking forward to receiving ""Pacific"" after seeing ""Brothers"" which I cannot get enough of. After watching Pacific, I was somewhat let down with the story line and became tired of watching the lead character ""staring"" into space constantly in each scene. It got on my nerves.Don't get me wrong, it was still a great movie but not quite equal to the Brothers, which was outstanding."
1,Where's the writing? A complete dud.,"1. I had high hopes for this HBO series like many folks based on the Band of Brothers etc... But unfortunately, this mini-series was a complete dud. It makes me wonder... a lot of things, but the chief among them is the buring question: who in the world wrote this tangential mini-series. As with many things in life, it all comes down to the fundamentals and in films that means solid writing and solid acting. The acting was ok, but with the completely terrible writing, it just made the mini-series barely watchable.2. It's something that could have been great, but unfortunately was marred back the lack of a coherent story and solid writing."
3,Pacific Theatre,"We were looking forward to receiving this for 5 months; absolutely LOVE Band of Brothers, but this mini series is not as good as the ""original."" Overall an okay rainy or snowy weekend watch but not an alltime favorite : ("
2,Disappointing,"While this series had incredibly high production values, and was visually stunning, it was quite a disappointment.Decent acting. Poor character development. Sluggish pace. No memorable dialog. All it has going for it is looks. Shallow.Even with the barrage of masterfully done battle scenes, I struggled to make it through the entire series.Stick with Band of Brothers. If you want Pacific Theater drama, go with The Thin Red Line, and the Letters from Iwo Jima / Flags of our Fathers combo."
5,WWll,Grandson age 21 and a Marine wanted to learn about WWll. Best history to see how the WWll was fought.
4,Different from Band o Bros but still good.,"Don't expect a Band of brothers with palm trees. It is much more based on 3 individual Marines than a band. No coverage of MacArthur's Army and Air Corp role in the pacific. To me, reading the books it is based on (plus Goodbye Darkness, Flags of our fathers, etc.) is probably more enjoyable than the movie but it is still good."
3,Disappointing yet I can't criticize it,"Sigh... A great story gone awry. I am drawn to shows like this and I value the service of the greatest generation. I am just sad that this mini-series does not deliver. At times it is fine and at times it is awful. Who was in charge of script? Why did the 'lighting' go bad during night shots? And why are there so many endless monologues? This could be a great tv show but I am disappointed. However, there are some high moments too. All in all, 3 stars out of 5 would suffice. I wish I could give it 4 stars."
5,Amazing,"From start to finish it was an amazing journey. I first read the books before watching the series... i must say they were very accurate for the most part. I am a huge fan of this series! I loved band of brothers which focused more on the soldiers then the war.. this series focuses more on war... its essentially the main character. Id say if you are expecting another BoB, get that out of your mind! This is a different perspective! The marines in this story are an amazing bunch that accomplished the impossible! Its important to remember these very special people and what they did to win the war! Some might think its shining a negative light on the marines, i dont agree. seriously, give the show a shot!"
5,Pacific series is awsome,"As a former marine I felt the series is produced in a way that gives a non marine a little insight into the corps and the bantering that goes back and forth. It is very graphic, but halfway through (part 5) shows them in Austrailia during some R&R - this may give guys who are watching with thier girl friend or wife some relief from all the action."
4,A Turbulent Pacific,"The Pacific miniseries was as far as I can tell accurate. I was in the US Navy during this period but, fortunately,did not serve in this area. An exciting, sad, well produced series. Would recommend it highly to any student of history."
1,very good series,very good series. tons of action. good story. very sad that syria not have good entertainmant as 'merika. I recommend to pppl. very good product. i hope they make more of stuff like this
2,A disappointment from Brady Games,"While the printing is acceptable and the binder seems sturdy enough, the maps feel hastily done like they were just screen shots from the game and enlarged without any sharpening. Most of the pertinent information is at the back of the book, not kept with the maps. Rare spawns are not marked on the maps making them a pain to find. There are also no instance maps in this book at all. If you insist on having everything WoW related then you might like this book, otherwise you will be disappointed at the quality and content."
2,mediocre,"The illustrations are nice, but over-all the book feels unprofessional. The first thing that alludes to this is the mistaken flight paths (poor quality control on Brady's behalf). The other thing that bother's me is the lack of a North Arrow typically found on maps, on the smaller city-town maps - some of the maps for these are orientated upside down or sideways from how you are used to looking at them from the in game map. For instance, the map for Feathermoon has the pier jutting out to the water on the left making you realize the map is upside down from how you think about it in the game. Oh, there are no Instance\Dungeon maps either, so dont buy this book expecting those."
5,It's a great,"Would love to read more just like it. If you want to learn something, feel like there are other people out there just like you and want to take away some soothing solutions...buy it."
5,An eye-opening alternate history that uses over 700 pages of Julian's original writings,Adrian Murdoch's THE LAST PAGAN: JULIAN THE APOSTATE AND THE DEATH OF THE ANCIENT WORLD tells of the violent death of the emperor Julian and his journey from his Christian childhood to his involvement in pagan cults and his mission to establish paganism as the dominant faith of the Roman world. An eye-opening alternate history that uses over 700 pages of Julian's original writings to provide some eye-opening new revelations on his beliefs.
3,"No verbs, only nouns; outdated words","This book only contains nouns, no verbs. To a learner like me, it is equally important to know verbs to form sentences. However, I agree that there is good coverage of nouns.If you are an absolute beginner in Chinese, this may not be the best book for you. Some of the words used in this dictionary are outdated - if you used them in a real conversation, Chinese speakers would laugh at you."
4,More! Soul Jazz Latin Flavours Nineties Vibes,"The title pretty much says it all - it's jumpin' jive jazz of every variety - a little pop, a little soul, a little latin, and a little cool - and all swinging party jazz.It's not very deep - they're just out for a good time!"
2,to short only 50 min,to short only 50 min . and to mach time on the Negative not the Positive side of this President and not a lot time spend on early years
2,Lousy Quality,"Well at first I was fairly pleased with this headset. Then the insulation on the top of the controller began to peel off. The quality is not so good on the treble and on the bass you get alot of flutter. I would never buy this brand of headset again, the wires are way to small and wear down with use. I have had this controller less than a month and its already becoming useless!!"
4,Good buy,"I'd say all in all that this is a great headset. I'm not an extreme audiophile, but I do like plenty of bass and since I still live with my family, I didn't want them being disturbed by late night fragging sessions and such, and getting a pair of actual surround sound speakers would do little to prevent disturbances, hence the reason for buying a surround sound headset. Sounds great, good bass and response, although i'm sure there are better ones out there. The fit is comfortable and not too heavy. Mic works well too. Only thing that I don't like is the hissing sound that comes up when you switch the SRS unit on. It's not too bad if you turn the sound up and get into the game, but if it's on low volume, it can be kind of distracting. But all in all, for the price, it's a reasonable buy."
1,cirquenut,"Before you spend one dime on this CD or many dimes on the Live Concert, please go the Cirque website and play the samplers for each song.I love Cirque music, but this was like listening to a cheap re-make by some fly by night record company hawking CD's on a late night infomercial.Ethereal, eclectic, mysterious - exquisite ""alien"" languages. - No, not here. Listen to the sound track of Alegria, then play Delirium's Latin club re-re-remix - Mon Dieu!Has Cirque's Marketing Department sold Cirque's soul?"
5,Great for saving space :],This wall file is perfect for holding those bigger folders or files. It is also crystal clear which makes it simple to know what is in there. I think the clear is the best for wall files!I use this for putting my lined papers and other stuff for school.
5,Delta goodrem rocks!!!,"This concert is fantastic and an enjoyable watch as Delta shows why she is one of the best singers, songwriters and musicians in the world. The set list of songs is of a wide variety of tunes and Delta sings them all wonderful well. This is a must buy for any Delta Goodrem fan!!!"
4,Multiple uses,"I liked this product as both a leaf and root fertilizer for plants I had transplanted, some of which were not in good shape and their survival was questionable at best. It did not help rootless cuttings (for me) to become rooted when used with Replicator gel. If it were less expensive and free shipping, I'd probably buy it again although I still have a little left."
5,new client...oldie search,"I have enjoyed this particular selection since I was a little girl, and one day I decided to search Amazon.com for older music,...well, there she was, along with a few other oldie goldies on my wish list!!! Yes, I will be back for more. Thanks Amazon for holding on to the good stuff!!!D"
3,"Confused about the category? Me, too!","I read the book and enjoyed it. . .hesitantly. I have thoroughly enjoyed much of what was in the book--I enjoy thinking, and this book certainly made me do that. I picked up the book when I saw the author (one of my favorites!) and the Newbery--an award I respect in the children's genre. However, this was not a children's book. I teach school and will leave this in my classroom but not recommend it--I feel that this book was written for adults starring children. Thinking is good, the ambiguous ending actually adds to the book in my opinion, but deals with issues that are better dealt with from an adult perspective"
5,The Irish Tenors Arrival,"I was very satisfied with the condition of the CD. It was just like what was stated, ""like new"". The were no scratches, even the container was in good shape. It arrived as stated. Very happy with this transaction."
5,There are not enough stars to rate this CD,"For those of us who love to curl up on the couch and listen to truly beautiful music, this is one CD you won't regret buying. With a ""light orchestra"", these talented men managed to turn out some of the most gorgeous and lush music I have ever heard. It must be said, however, if music brings out your emotions, have a box of tissues close by. Anthony Kearns singing ""Grace"" will send you reaching for them, as will Ronan Tynan's ""The Town I Loved So Well"". Let's talk about John McDermott. He's not Irish (He is a Scot). But the most heart rending ""Danny Boy"" I have never heard before. ""Voyage"" was so beautiful, it made me sob. Now that we have established I am a hopeless sap, please trust me when I say that this music touches the deep recesses of the soul. If this CD fails to warm and satisfy you, then your heart is just too hard! This is healing music from the ""True Doctors of Soul"" ....Irish Soul, that is."
4,"This is a ""NO SPOILER BOOK"" which I like.","Unlike other Prima books, this one doesn't hand you anything except Basics. That I like. It is a handy book to have around. Yes, you can find everything on websites, but why leave the game to look at a website (for those with just one computer on net) when you can flip straight to a page in the book. For instance: You're low on cash, what spell should you buy 1st? The Expanded version also has better SKILLs listing on what is needed to make what.This book, in reality, should have came with the game to begin with rather than the small manual Verant gave.It is my ""Bible"" that sits next to me while adventuring. I scan it while sitting on Bloated. :) Bangy-RodCet Nife"
2,"Please, make it stop.","I have to commend Jeremy M. Harris for his review. I started reading the book, really thinking it was a kind of epistemological exercise, but gradually I felt it came across as a kind of cooky religious statement. I told myself, initially, 'So what, he believes in God, only an atheist would dismiss his work out of hand' - and being that I'm agnostic, I thought I'd just brave the religious clap-trap and continue reading. But, again, gradually I found it unbearable, like the author was doing everything to justify his profession to a potentially religious audience. Sure, Mr. Rizzi offers some interesting insights concerning scientific truths. However, I couldn't recommend this to anyone deeply concerned with thinking and how the application of thought works in a scientific context. For that I'd recommend Jefferey Kluger's ""Simplexity""."
3,Visual Masterpiece,"I'll tell you what, this is one frustrating game! Sometimes I wonder whether it's worth going ballistic over. I imagine it will be, if for the visuals alone. I believe that games are supposed to be moderately challenging. Challenging, but not downright frustrating. For example, try disarming that friggin' bomb in the first level! That's worth a couple o' gray hairs. I mean, when you die you might as well get up,grab yerself a drink or something to eat 'cos by the time you get back the game will probably still be loading...And believe me, it's way too easy to die in this game. I'm gonna complete this game because I'm a very intuitive individual who doesn't get mad very easily. If you're the exact opposite, you best stick to those player-friendly games like...oh...Mario Kart or whatever the heck it's called!"
5,"An awesome,unique adventure--from Eidos?","This game really suprised me>first of all,the graphics are stuning.Looping full--motion video back grounds makes the gritty.The best graphics to ever grace a playstation.Please buy this one--for your own sake."
1,ANNOYING!!!,"This game BAD! In fact, it's the worst game I have ever played! I totally wasted ""My money""! The ending is bad and two main charachters are killed because of the ordinary and dumb storyline. Every enemy is annoying and stupid. I definitly do not recommend this game to gamers."
2,Enjoy The Screen Grabs,"I recently rented this game and am wondering why everyone says this game is so great. Admitedly I never got far into the game, but I can consider myself a rather open-minded gamer and have a large fustration berth, but this game REALLY taxed it. The most obvious complaint being that this game just isn't fun. It tries way to hard to emulate RE, but doesn't capture the intensity, or fun factor. In fact the action stinks in this game. It's very easy to die here, and the battles are less skill based than having a better weapon. Maybe you should just rent the game and see if you like it, seeing as so many people disagree with me."
3,A double edged sword,"I have never played a game that was so great at the same time as being so bad. The atmosphere is cool. The action is fun and the story is good. However, certain parts of the game are WAY too hard. Especially on playstation where you have to wait 30 seconds for your game to load, it is very frustrating to have to replay sections that are near impossible to get by. You cant run very fast either which makes it hard to fight people. Also, what is very, VERY frustrating and down right outragous is that ther are a lot of parts that you have to die 10 times to figure out how to get past. That is stupid. I like games more like Resident evil 1-3 where you can reasonably pass through areas with a little caution and smarts. This game is not like that. I think they should have done a little more R + D before releasing it."
5,Everything you need in one book,"Most of us have a library of books for each aspect of one particular subject. As a new Yorkie owner, I struck gold with this one. It touches on the history of the breed but gets into the things I need to personally know from choosing a breeder all the way to the puppy's adulthood and beyond. It's very detailed, full of options and compares products and brands specifically for Yorkies. This book is worth more than the asking price too. It is one book that will not just sit and collect dust on my shelf after one reading!"
4,Great saw,"I purchased this saw about a year ago. The saw has performed great. The only reason I did not rate this saw a 5 is that changing the blade is a pain in the you know what. The small spring inside the blade gaurd is difficult to line up when reassembling after changing the blade. But the saw performed great right out of the box. It was very accurate. I do not have an extention table yet, I'm kind of cheap that way but I will be setting it up in a table system I have seen on The New Yankee Work Shop. I think you will like the saw very much. When this one is worn out I will buy the compound sliding miter saw next, but if not that one I would buy this one again."
5,"Great first ""big kid"" lego set!","My daughter is 6 1/2 and was getting far too bored with her Duplo sized Lego. She really wanted to get a ""real"" Lego set like her older brother, but she isnt interested in Star Wars, Indiana Jones, Trolls and Dwarves, etc. There just aren't many options for girls! But she is a HUGE animal lover and when we saw this set, we KNEW it would be perfect for her. She received it for Christmas today and was so excited. She is learning to follow all the steps and build on her own. It is challenging but not frustrating for her. The best part? She LOVES bats... and the book has instructions for making a Lego Bat!"
1,MORE Language of letting go,"This was a self-serving JOURNAL of the flying and sky-diving accomplishments of the author. If I wanted to know about her personal life and adventures - I would become a pen-pal. The two books, ""MORE..."" and ""Language..."", are like night and day! The two could not be more different! Never have I regretted buying a book more."
2,One cracked after a practice session,"These have cloth handles and bamboo blades. After a short practice session, one edge of the blade broke pretty quickly. Disappointing that it is not very durable."
1,Don't buy,"If you are interested in Kendo, looking to train and save a little money. Don't buy these. You get what you pay for. These shinai are decorative pieces. Not meant for practice at all. Steer clear."
2,"47"" Kendo Shinai","We didn't have these swords long, but one of them already broke. The string came undone on the other one as well. I didn't think that these were going to be fragile items, and should be able to take some punishment, but I was wrong. If you buy, don't hit too hard with them."
1,No good for Kendo,"I purchased this set of shinai based on price, and that was my first mistake. They are made in China, with all the poor craftsmanship that this normally entails. During my first kendo practice using one of these shinai, one of the take (bamboo slats) broke within the first hour of use. They are not strong enough for kendo and may cause injury due to their weakness. Possibly useful for LARP or cosplay, but not martial arts."
1,Great for about 3 minutes with a 10 year old,"Right out of the box my daughter and I started playing around with these in the living room, not really going at it very hard and about 3 minutes into our light playing my daughter came at me with a swipe that broke the Shinai I was using clean in half. We just stared at each other for about 10 seconds. All I could do was assure her that she hadn't done anything wrong. Amazon was Excellent on the UPS pickup and return credit.I have used bamboo fighting sticks for years and I didn't think it could break like that. I have to assume these are made of some kind of bamboo substitute. Obviously, I wouldn't recommend."
2,Picture is misleading,"The picture is misleading, they do not have a guard, so there is nothing to protect your hand. Overall they are cheaper quality, and will break with use, but are cheap enough in price so that is to be expected. I will not be ordering these as replacements after my initial shipment is done."
2,Great use for five minutes....,Great use for five minutes then one broke. Having use Kendo Shinai bamboo swords before I would not suggest these and only bought them as I had a $25 dollar gift certificate to get rid of.
5,"A True ""Treasury"" of Desserts","This is, by far, the very best dessert cookbook that I had the joy of using. I have tried many recipes from this book and they are all WONDERFUL!! There are many ""old fashioned"" recipes for goodies that I haven't eaten since I was a child. The instructions are explicit, yet easy; and best of all, most recipes don't require that you purchase special items, they usually require ingredients that are a normal part of your cabinet inventory. The book is loaded with useful baking tips. You can get rid of all other dessert cookbooks. I Love It!!!!"
1,The worst manual ever: do not buy it!,"I would like to add some few words about this book. In two days I'm going to take the GRE after I tried to study using this book: I wasted my time, the software included didn't work at all, the explanations about the different topics are absolutely abstruse and unclear."
3,Could be better,"This car seat base is a newer kind than my friends have, and even though it takes up less room in the car, it seems to slide all over if it's put in the center - which they say is the best place for babies. I even have the LATCH system in my new car, and it still is kind of annoying. So, I had to move the baby to the side seat so he won't slide. They need to improve on this."
5,good watch,"This is my second Pulsar watch in 15 years and if this one is as good as my last one,then it will be great. I highly recommend a Pulsar watch."
1,Worst Elseworlds EVER.,"I have an idea. Let's write alternate history that isn't really alternate. Superman is on the winning side... of the side that won without Superman. Not exactly edge-of-your-seat reading. As for the other reviewers here raving about the ""twist"" ending? At the end he flies off into the sky on a magical horse. Pardon me while my head explodes. Avoid at all costs. If you want a _good_ Superman Elseworlds title, stick with Red Son."
5,WHAT A BOOK!,"This book is WONDERFUL. It is easy to read and the humor is great too! It gives you more information then you can image. It prepares you with questions to ask your doctor; what foods to avoid, how to share what you are going through with your mate and much, much more. More importantly, she praises God! A book to have in your library. An EXCELLENT Reference tool. I have recommended this book to four women within the last two months and told at least twenty or so about it. Ladies, we must not keep this to ourselves... SHARE it with others."
2,Doesn't last very long,"I got this to cut some trim from two 4x8 hardiplank panels. Unfortunately I couldn't get through about 40 feet of cuts, before the blade became uncontrollable. I couldn't keep it on a straight line, and it would heat up, warp, and tear up my expensive hardiplank. Initially it cut beautifully, with a very thin Kerf, quick and smooth. But it went south very fast. I found one other review on the internet which seemed to confirm the short life span of this blade. I expected more from such a reputable brand."
1,Not at all What I Expected,"Personally, I think this ""book"" is awful. Critical content that is conjecture and speculation of an obtuse sort. Get this- Grassi thinly assumes early on that the ""beloved disciple"" and the Gospel author are two different people! The book diverges like a hungry tapeworm from this point. He makes other claims that result in a view both implausible and IMO statistically impossible. How anyone with scholarly knowledge of the scriptures could stomach this missive - let alone reread it again! - is beyond me. This one is a true clunker, unpersuasive, and certainly boring. Buyer beware!"
5,Magic bullet for quick DNS fixes/receipies,"If you need to understand the difference between BIND 9 or Windows AD DNS and BIND 8, this is not the book for you. But if your management decides to tell you about the imporant new product launch on 20 servers in a new domain they just bought and kept under wraps to stun the competition which they need implemented in some novel way that requires a DNS twist, THIS will save you.It will also save you if you are really a Windows admin, but you need to configure something in BIND. Or if you need to do something in BIND that you haven't done before.Or if you don't care WHY you have to do task X, Y and then Z to get the desired result, but you need to know HOW? This is your book.The WHY is in the BIND book from O'Reilly."
4,A NICE PROBLEM-SOLVING ORIENTATION,"""DNS & BIND Cookbook"" is a problem-solving text, which Network Administrators will be glad to read. It displayed utmost rationality in its simple and concise way of dealing with most problems, which arise from Domain Name Systems. It also exposed all the factors, which are likely to escalate Berkeley Internet Name Domain problems, before providing their remedies in a clear sequential order.Net Administrators (as well as voracious users of any of the major Operating Systems) would appreciate the inclusion of an easy-to-digest chapter on Internet Protocol version 6, (IPv6). This book clearly made the mark!Apart from the rather summarized information, which I noticed on two of its chapters, (i.e.: 'Create Zone Files For Your Domains' and 'Use Increment Transfer'), there is nothing that I will hold against this book. Cricket Liu did a very good job in writing it."
3,"OK, Not the Best ""Cookbook"" I've Read","This book has some useful and helpful tips, but spends too many pages (IMO) covering really really basic stuff (whois, etc.). I'm used to the O'Reilly cookbooks covering things that are more insightful, less obvious or creative."
2,Too complicated for older children,This was advertised as a book for older children to find night sky objects with telescope. This is much too complicated a book for this age group
3,Keep looking,After reading reviews on many astronomy books I chose this one. It was not a good choice for the astronomy 'beginner' that I bought it for.
4,VERY GOOD PURCHASE,"Dear sirs,I live in Brazil, and I was affraid to get products in other country. But I was confident with Amazon.com site content and security. Then I decided to make my first ""out-of-the-box"" purchase, and I'm astonished with the extremely professional approach of Amazon.com .My product was delivered 15 days earlier than planned, and in good conditions, including the package.The book content is very comprehensible, mainly for amateurs, as I am. I'm very satisfied to get this book, and I reccomend it and Amazon.com also.Congratulations,Valter R.FranciscoSanto Andre, S.Paulo, Brazil"
5,The BEST Book I Ever Read On Astronomy,"I'd bought other 3 books before I bought this one and bought another 3 after buying this one. I haven't still found a book that matches the quality, fun and usability of this book. The writings are so friendly and comforting that probably all your other books of same level will collect dust. The author has written each article as if he knew exactly what you would want to know and what you would ask. While I like to figure out star hoping by myself, it's still really helpful to see the ""real view"" diagram from the telescope, nice constellation figures, associated facts and mythology. If you recently bought a small cheap telescope then this book is an absolutely must. If you are an advanced guy carrying Meade 10"" computerized scope in back of your truck, you would still enjoy bringing back the fun of star hopping and rediscovering the objects in this book."
3,Nice Pictures,"Typical board book, does have nice, real pictures of the animals. Take not it is a SMALL board book, about the size of your palm."
1,Don't waste your money.,"I thought this would be a good addition to my small shop. WRONG! After setting up the machine and getting terrible results, I found that the infeed and outfeed tables were not flat. The castings had warped - probably during machining. After waiting about a month, the dealer installed new infeed and outfeed tables and the machine works - but don't expect to do anything other than two to three foot boards on it. It just won't work. Save your money a little longer and get a REAL tool."
5,I think this might be my favorite volume...,"In this volume, Kohaku has to go back to heaven. Their time apart makes Kohaku and Shuichiro realize how much they want to be together. This volume may be my favorite volume in this series. I love how the characters interact, and my absolute favorite line of the series, the one that makes me laugh every time, is in this book. I also loved the bit at the end of the volume that explains how Hisui and Kokuyo become a couple, even though it's not a very developed part. It just happens to be very sweet. I would recommend this volume to almost anyone, although it would probably help to have read some of the previous volumes. However, when I started this series, I started with volume four, and I could still follow along well enough."
4,Not quite what I expected,Some reviewers said that this helped give their kids a good depiction of what heaven will be like and I just don't see it. It was cute but it didn't teach my child much about Heaven the way I expected it would.
1,Hard to finish,"I loved the first book by Grange and I was happy to find this book. I hated it. I could not care less about the main character or, for that matter, any of the other characters. The plot is transparent. A bloody book but definitely not Blood Red River. FYI I read this book in French (my native language.)"
4,Awesome,"""Rule~ A Iroasenai Hibi"" is the BEST song on the CD. Probably my all time favorite song of Maaya Sakamoto."
5,Great for granddaughters too,"I purchased the red C9 sports car for a grandson and my granddaughter had to have one too. Her favorite color is pink so this model was ideal.Quality construction, prompt delivery, all models have interchangeable parts. The kids have fun combining their cars into unique models."
5,A great lady!,"This is a great video, it could be longer and have more info. on the Queen. But, it's a great biography episode to watch. If you want to know more about her majesty get this video and her audio-bio ""Leap of Faith"": memoirs of an unexpected life."
1,Not a Book and Not by Insider's,"The title is misleading, and most people who buy this pamphlet misrepresented as a book are going to be very disappointed. This a 40 page stream of conscious review of various categories of life that lacks footnotes, a bibligraphy, or an index.Based on my own broad experience and friendship with futurists of note, I consider this specific paper to be interesting if you don't read a lot and want a very shallow overview of numerous areas in the time it takes to fly from one state to another, but I find it very disturbing to read randomized references to ideas that I have seen developed and documented by others in a much more thorough fashion over the past 25 years or so."
4,"Young, tragic love","I remember reading this book in middle school with my eyes glued to every page. It was a different experience for me because it introduced impending tragedy. This is a sequel to Til Death Do Us Part. The main character, April Lancaster, is terminally ill and mourning the death of her fiancée in the first book. Her family decides to take her on a vacation. There she meeds Brandon Benedict. They spend time helping each other heal from hurtful memories of their past. With April still in mourning, she can't so easily give her heart to Brandon. This complication last through the book but comes to a head at the conclusion.While utterly depressing, I think these types of books are valuable subject matter and thought provoking. This is a young adult series that gives teens a solid understanding of how fleeting life can be. It definitely makes you reflect on how lucky your life may be. I definitely recommend this read."
1,NOT WORTH THE PRICE,This item is way over priced I bought from AMAZON.COM not as described NOT clear would not recommend very unhappy with purchase. I needed a bigger mat but didn't have the right size took a chance but Wrong wanted CLEAR it's like it's frosted or something if you want a clear mat PASS THIS ONE UP JUST KEEP LOOKING. I was looking for a mat when I got this one still looking sad to say. OH well it will do till I find the right mat just so SORRY wasted the money they could have been put better use.:-(
1,not what I expected . . .,"I was underwelmed with this one. Somehow this book looks like it was researched thinly via the internet (entirely perhaps), it most certainly relies on re-using existing projects recently published and offers very little, if anything in the way of new dialogue here. Is this an interesting catagory? Yes, most certainly. ... Is this book adding anything to the discussion? Im afraid not."
2,DISSAPPINTMENT :(,"The movie was more of a trailer or introduction to a bigger movie. I was very dissapointed with it and there was lots of unneccessary hype on it. I believe the acting could have been much better. The women coming up the stairs was the best actress, and she only had a 5 second clipping. What I do appreciate is the fact that there is a director who is brave, concious, and powerful enough to make a movie on lesbians of color. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it, but would recommend donating to the director in any way you can. If a entire movie came out, I guess would buy it."
3,Chicory Seeds,"The seeds sprouted quickly, healthy. After a few months, the leaves started turning white, cracking, and half of them died. So I don't know what's going to happen to the plants."
5,Grafzeppelin Great Kit,Revell does it again ! The Grafzeppelin is a great kit for anyone to build! Parts fit easily and are well layed out. Enjoy this one I did!
3,EASY Windows XP,"This is a very elementary book for XP. There are some programs of value but overall, not inclusive enough to be of more help than other books have been to me"
4,"Don't Skip School Folks, Really","When a special episode of Arthur and his friends' favorite television program, ""Dark Bunny"" airs, the gang is seriously peeved because Mr. Ratburn has piled them down with homework and with all of that work, they're not going to be able to watch it. That is until Arthur threatens that he just won't do his homework, in fact, he'll even skip school. Francine doesn't believe him and so she decides to call him on it- by daring him! Things escalate from there, until everyone in Arthur's treehouse is dared, including the studious Brain! You'll have to read the book to find out how they deal with this, but it all comes down to the lesson that you shouldn't do something you know is wrong simply to prove that you can. This book isn't as funny as some of the other Arthur chapter books and some of it is just weird, but overall it's still a decent story."
5,Outstanding,Sound quality did improve over the plastic pegs. Next in line is to tweak my bridge by replacing the plastic saddle with a Tusq. This should improve my sustain and tone even more. If you're looking for a budget increase of tone ... this is a way to go.
5,Work as advertised. Small but noticeable affect. Good!,"I also bought the bridge saddle and combined the two.Works exactly as advertised. Improved sustain and clarity on my mid-low level Sigma acoustic guitar. The biggest improvement was the balance in volume and tone from one string to the next (previously the highest three strings were louder and more twangy that the lower 3). The overall sound is brighter without the twang and the bass strings have more projection. If you have a $100-$600 guitar this would be worthwhile, in my opinion."
3,Slight upgrade only,"These pins, while fitting well, didn't live up to the hype. In my humble opinion, I think a set of bone pins is a much better improvement. That said, I do think the Tusq pins are a big improvement over the plastic pins that come standard these days. They are a good deal for the price."
4,Plus ca change...,"I just finished reading this expose and was quite impressed with the author's writing style. The cabal which formed to thwart John's efforts at GHS obviously felt threatened when a qualified ""outsider"" arrived with a passion to deliver a quality education to all students. Most appalling was the failure of the school administrators and the Board of Education to offer even minimal support in dealing with the frivolous grievances. The problems which John encountered are not endemic to just Appalachia, but in all our school systems. Unfortunately, nothing has changed in Grant County. All one needs to do is read about the town council meetings or the Board of Education meetings in the local newspaper. Factionalism and petty jealousies are rampant. Plus ca change, plus c'est la meme chose!"
1,Outraged,I am a former student of Grant County Schools and I am outraged at the contents of this book.
3,Not work with my microsoft wireless laser mouse 5000,"To be Honest, This item is really GREAT and I love it. However when I tried to use my mouse suddenly didn't work, I'm not sure why, maybe because the ""look like glass surface"" (my table is black color tho). I have to return it because no way I have to use my mouse on another table. I will try the Kristal View.If you have a regular wire mouse, It will work perfectly."
4,"First disappointed, then I found it ok","I received the pad in a carton wrap - not really a box. The concierge didn't even think there was anything inside this piece of carton. The ""box"" was bent in 3 places so I was afraid the pad would be damaged. It was somewhat bent and it took about 3 days for it to be completely flat laid down on the desk. SO I was disappointing at first, and now I find ok. I wish the surface was less shiny, with a matte finish, but perhaps the surface would not be as comfortable for writing. It's a little overpriced though... I would have guessed something like this would be $15-$20."
1,dont waste your money,this item was a joke. i could tell athing different while taking these.i should have askwd for my money back.
3,too many disks,The only thing I object to in this release is that there are too few episodes per disk and too many disks. There were 13 episodes so there should have been only 2 disks with 7 episodes on disk 1 and 6 episodes on disk 2.
1,The Golden Cockerel and Other Fairy Tales,"This book by Aleksandr Sergeevich Pushkin I've read for the first time probably in 1956, in Russian. I remember the contents because later on I've been reading it to my children in Polish. The original version did impress me much more than the translation. Right now I'm living in Canada and have just a few books in Russian. I'm not a wealthy person, but very sentimental. The reason I'm writing this ""review"" is in fact an attempt to find out about the unexpensive way to get a few more books in Russian, not necessarily by A.S. Pushkin."
1,Greek-English Dictionary,"Since the Greek translations were not written in Roman letters, it was completely useless for a traveler."
3,A tasty morsel of philosophy and fiction,"Cossé's essay-length book has a provocative premise: How would proof of God's existence effect a secular modern government and its keepers? While the writing is swift and crisp, I was disappointed by the hasty, too-neat ending. (The concluding pages read as if the author had run out of steam, or interest.) Still, Cossé deserves credit for staging her intriguing scenario in a credible fictional landscape. The opening pages, when one of the characters walks across Paris at dawn, observing an awaking urban world he is convinced will be transformed by the divine good news, are especially strong and evocative--much more so than the later unfolding of the plot."
3,works for sewing machines,this works pretty good for cleaning the lint out of sewing machines. a flexible hose would be nice to get in hidden spots
4,Metro Vacuum,Product works as advertised. I use to clean both my desktop and laptop computers as well as my printers and faxes. This product will work with any electronic devices.
3,"Buena música, pero nada nuevo.","No conocía al compositor cuando me compré el cd, pero soy un amante de la música contemporánea y me gusta conocerlo todo.Cuando ví la edad que tenía el compositor, me impacienté aun más por llegar a mi casa y escucharlo, ya que supuse que alguien tan joven estaría en el avant-garde, pero no fue así.No aporta nada nuevo, todo lo que propone ya ha sido explorado por otros, incluso con mayor éxito, aunque tampoco quedé decepcionado, ya que no soy una persona que deseche algo por no estar a la cabeza. Si no, también desecharía a Bach, ya que en su época también estaba pasado de moda. La música es buena, y las interpretacíones tambien lo son. Por eso le concedo 3 estrellas."
5,Most Challenging Game; not for kiddies,"This game is tough and unforgiving but well worth the challenge if you are up to it.Unlike Goldeneye, you won't be able to take multiple gunshots to the chest and keep walking, you'll be dead.MI at times is so realistic at times it is scary, yes, tedious at times. Don't expect to blast your way out of trouble much.Because of the required skill, the reviews of the game and its popularity have suffered.Perhaps this game separates the real gamers from the ones from the wannabees."
4,"Its a good game, but it really could have been better.","The graphics and audio in this game really leave more to be desired, but the overall gameplay is loads of fun. Mission objectives and dificuly are good although you won't find yourself in a lot of full-blown shoot outs. Nevertheless, it is a good game and I definitely would reccomend it."
3,"Good,Challenging,but you cant beat bond!","Mission Impossible lived up to its name! This is the hardest video game I have probably ever played! Ice hit, and Recover the NOC list are good, and Mole hunt kicks serious butt! However, CIA escape is almost Impossibly mind boggalling difficult. Plus,more than half of these levels are as boring as hell. Take all of CIA escape for example. Way too much stealth required here. And Embassy function. {yawn}. Once you get to mole hunt, the fun comes back and action like in good old Goldeneye. The Train roof level is a blast, but needs better music like in the movie. All in all, a crackerjack pack of a game. But I think I will stick with bond."
3,"Fast paced,sexual & emotional tensions provide good reading","Hazard is a women of the 90's, to much of a feminist for her own good, a crime that she always believes is murder much to the dismay of her love, Nick Thorn, she makes alot of mistakes, of which we all do, but finally gets her man and/or women, with a lot of everyday strife involved. I think it's fun reading along with trying to solve a crime. Now if I could just find ""Dead In The Dirt"", I'd be a happy camper."
2,Way overpriced.,"On my desk, using a $50 Microsoft optical mouse, this product rendered it unusable. I must *cover* this thin plastic sheet in order to restore mouse function, and that from a mouse I can use on literally anything I cared to previously.This product is a thin scrim of clear plastic stamped from a giant roll of the stuff, nothing more. It probably has a manufacturer's cost under $0.25, not including the flamboyant packaging. It has no properties whatsoever that make it unique to desk blotter work. I thought I'd try one before getting a pair. I will not buy a second. Poor value."
2,"Avoid use on wood with lacquer, acrylic, or urethane finish","Just received, there is a small sticker on the product that says ""Avoid use on wood with lacquer, acrylic, or urethane finishes as material may mar surface."" I wish I'd seen that info in the online product description! I'm not sure how much of that is CYA, but I'm too nervous to try on my wood desk. Product is very clear and otherwise appealing, has a soft somewhat tacky finish--I suppose that is why you shouldn't use it to protect your wood desk."
5,First really useful VB book!,"I bought this book at Costco, just because they were selling it cheap. But it ended up to be the most useful VB book I own. It bypasses the regular ""place the textbox on the form"" crap and takes you right to the good stuff. I used SQL Server 6.5 a lot and my company is considering upgrading to version 7.0, so the ""What's new in 7.0"" section was really helpful. Also the section on internet programming was a great find! Overall this is an excellent book, it's very concise and easy to read!"
3,Pretty but not functional,This is a very feminine shoe with a very high heel. I had to return them because I could not keep them on my feet. The slingback strap kept slipping off. Pretty but not wearable.
2,Disappointing,"Martin Amis' long (perhaps long-winded) novel about a femme fatale-psychic who is predisposed to being murdered as she entraps Keith Talent, a brutish dart player, and Guy Clinch, a struggling writer into her web of seduction and deceit. Amis pads this thin story with typically entertaining and satisfying scenarios that he seems to have a knack for, but the novel just isn't nearly as interesting as his Information or Money. At some point during the project, Amis lost touch with the original force of his conception, and you can tell that the rest of the material is simply a weak attempt to complete the aborted project. Not a bad read, but probably too much of a commitment for the quality, even among fans of Amis' usually interesting prose."
1,Waste of time,"I've never rated a book on Amazon before, but I can't be quiet about this one. I saw the author's name mentioned favorably in an article and decided to read one of his books. A waste of my precious time. Frequently debated whether to continue to the end, and I'm sorry I did. The characters are sickening; the plot is stupid; the ending is unfulfilling; the book is long; the language requires a dictionary."
3,"Dark, funny and murderous, but ultimately empty","I really enjoy the voice and the spirit of this story, but its overwrought construction is too distracting. Set in the late 90s and imbued with apocalyptic dread of the approaching millennium, it is still just a murder mystery (minus, unfortunately, the mystery.) Still, I can't deny that I had a lot of fun reading the first two-thirds of the book, and that I found its narrator as engaging as some of his subjects -- notably Keith the darter. Ironically, however, it is this same narrator who finally undoes the story's magic, and it hurt me to watch the story sputter and die over the last 50 to 100 pages. At turns bawdy, comic, tragic and caustic, Amis's narrative style almost overcomes the story's crash landing. I frequently found myself laughing out loud and shaking my head over his ingenious monologue, but in the end it isn't enough. The real disappointment is that it could easily have been a masterpiece."
2,ok... what's up with this trash?,"Alright, alright... now what the hell is up with this?... Harvey Danger?... Flagpole Sitta... I'm not seeing it... are you?? This is another case of a movie showcasing a song throughout it's trailor and all over the movie then BOGARTING the song by NOT putting it on it's soundtrack. This is just another in a long series of movies that uses a certain song to market the entire movie, then the movie either strikes the song from the soundtrack, or sometimes even from the MOVIE. who could forget Starship Troopers?...the way that they used ""Song 2"" by Blur in ALL the previews, then the song isn't used ONCE in the movie. This is crap, how could you NOT put Harvey Danger's song on this cd?? If i were you... i would NOT buy this, it's just a ""makeshift"" soundtrack, stay away from it."
4,Loved the Cd.,"I love the music on the CD, but where's Flagpole Sitta. I don't understand why they kicked off Harvey Danger! I like all the songs, but that was one of the best!"
1,Metro Vac,Had to return it. The motor was burned out. Could not get a replacement. I have bought a lot of items through Amazon and this was the first time I have had trouble.D.HillMetro Vacuum MDV-1BA DataVac 4.5-AMP Computer Vac/Blower
2,Better vacs out there for the money,"I bought this vac several years ago at a computer store. The only good thing I can say about it is that its easy to cart around. Poorly made, lid barely fits and then it leaks. Gets hot, noisy, blows hot exhaust everywhere. Maybe OK for one or two computers, but I'm sure there are better vacs for the money."
3,Carafe,"The carafe that I received was not the one that was pictured or the one that I ordered. I sent an E-mail to the supplier, but they never responded. I entered a complaint thru Amazon, but no one ever contacted me."
1,Poor quality,I expected better from Hormel. Will not keep anything hot for longer than two hours and then it's just warm. I suspect it's the result of a poorly designed pour system that allows the heat to escape through the top. Won't ever buy another Hormel.
4,Great collection of songs,Has your tipical songs then it has some other lesser known songs there are some big ones here and some little but it will get 4 stars because of the songs it has on it.
1,Worst Buy I ever made from Amazon,"I ordered this for my daughter who is moving home to finish college and needs a nice desktop. This item was a colossal disappointment. Picture the type of mousepad businesses have given away for years as promo items; rigid thin plastic surface and cheap foam backing. Then picture it bigger and gray. You get the picture. This item is worth maybe ten bucks, not the thirty four bucks I paid. Shame on Amazon! Wasn't even the size advertised. Returned it same day."
5,Exactly what you expect,my glass desk was driving me nuts. this fixed the problem. i was even able to get rid of my mousepad because this is a decent mousing surface.
5,A balanced history,"This book is a collection of essays about the Hiss/Chambers case. All points of view are taken into account, including supporters of Hiss, supporters of Chambers, and various agnostics.What is great about this book is that it doesn't just tell the story of the case, but it shows how these events influenced political thinking in America over the subsequent 50 years.To criticize this book by taking shots at Whittaker Chambers, as if it were uniformly supporting him, is foolish, reactionary, and illiterate."
3,quick guide,"simple quick guide, but if you need more information, this book doesn't have it. Not as informative as other manuels, but ok for very simple reference.This book should only cost $5.00, instead of $15, considering ""Offical Quickbook 6.0 ""guide cost $15 and have a ton of information. Try that book instead, if you want more infor.Quickbook pro user."
4,"Pleased, picks up small particles",Good for cleaning the keyboard or vents on the computer. Looks like this model replaced another dirt devil item that wasnt as good as this one.Pleased and would buy another if needed.
2,I took a chance so not surprised this is worthless......,Well I should of known better when ordering this because it was a 50/50 split on the negative and positive reviews. But I took a chance and ordered it. Basically everyone who said this lacks power is 100% correct. The suction on this is not just weak but practically non existent. It sure sounds like it will do something by all the noise it makes but it would hardly even pick up a hole punch disc(the little circles you empty out of a hole punch) I even tried a test to see if it would work and of course it failed. I just sprinkled a tiny bit of flour on my counter to see if it would suck it up. Well NO it sure did not. but all the air blowing from the side vents blew it around all over the kitchen. LOL Thankfully this was not expensive cuz if it was it would be going straight back. It is not the seller's fault as they don't make the product. Its Dirt Devil.
1,Better not drop it,"I've owned one of these for 15 years plus, but finally needed to replace mine as the cord was wearing out. In that time they've changed from a metal tip to plastic, although the picture still shows metal. I recently dropped it off of the plan table, and three out of the four prongs broke off, rendering it useless."
4,LOVE THIS BOOK!,"Brigette Bardot has a very amazing and interesting life story. I really enjoyed reading this and found it very inspiriting. She is very raw in her words and emotion and passionate about her love for animals. She was a free sprirt and really changed to way alot of people thought. She inspired pop culture and rock n' roll and the entire sexual revolution!!! I hope her own bio ""initials B.B."" will be released in English format someday. I also enjoyed Tony Crawleys book ""The Films of B.B."". She was the French Marilyn Monroe!"
1,Scare Tactics,"The book focuses on individual collection through persuasion. Call it whatever you want, its still just scare tactics. The author has been in collections for several decades and it shows. The author is definitely out of touch with today's society and acceptable business practices. He actively encourages letter writing and litigation, known to be the two worst approaches to collecting debt. Scare tactics, Scare tactics, Scare tactics. The example letters were so poorly written that I would be embarrassed to use them. The lack of a qualified proofreader is readily apparent. The book was so awful I immediately sent it back...."
1,Gotta say no on this one,"I'm pretty much pure Nikon, but I wouldn't buy this again. Poor atomizer. Shoots out heavy blobs of cleaner, over a foot out before it turns into a mist. This means that not only the lens, but the barrel, your hand, and anything else within a two or three foot circle catches the mist. And the cloth is not very absorbent so you spend a lot of time rubbing and rubbing. And rubbing."
3,Jusk ok...,The lens solution and moist cloths are ok. However my lens filter has blue lint from the microfiber cloth everytime I used it. I would not purchase this again.
1,Dissapointment,"This book is more like a pamphlet than a book. I was so dissapointed to find that this, ""We can work it out"" and ""Healing the pain between us"" are all just pamphlets which are almost exactly the same and even word for word in some parts. The author has one idea that he just repeats continually through all his books or pamphlets. He uses long drawn out stories as an example. The books are poorly written and this book held nothing substantial to use for social change. I have taken classes and workshops on social change and they taught me many things. Do not waste your money on this pamphlet. It is just a pretty cover that does not deliver what it promises."
2,Buyer Beware.,"100 percent cotton has this nasty habit of shrinkage so just because something says ""pre-shrunk"" doesn't mean it is. Sadly."
1,Worst TV Ever,"i have been having problems from day one. One of the biggest mistakes in my life was buying this TV.I purchased it from Westchester County NY, ""The Listenening Room"" in Scarsdale NY."
4,mind expanding,"Linda gives a feel for a future barely limited by time and physical presence. i was full of wonder imagining the possibilities. as other reviewers have said, more hard science then opera."
3,"A big drawn out, but way cool situation","I was impressed by Nagata's ""The Bohr Maker,"" and started ""Vast"" with high expectations. I was rewarded in the sense that the author set up a very interesting post-human, neuvo space opera situation quite different than the standard SF future. It's a bit more humanistic than Egan's ""Diaspora,"" which helps. (I found his software people hard to sympathize with.)I was very disappointed when I discovered that this is a sequel. There's enough information to pick up on what's a-happening, but I still felt that I was missing out on something.I was also a bit put off by the length of the book. Like a lot of current day novels, It shows signs of bloat.If the interface allowed me to use half stars, this one would rate 2 1/2; add a half star if you're coming to it from the prequel (""Deception Well."")"
