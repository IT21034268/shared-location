1,It won't get you anywhere,"1: I bought this course. 2: There wasn't enough vocabulary to explain the dialogues and I spent more money buying a dictionary. 3: There wasn't enough in the way of explaining the language and I spent yet more money buying a grammar (Prista's, very good). 4: The recordings were too fast and not clear, I gave them up. 5: The course is disorganised, goes back and forward, not in a steady progression and I got frustrated. 6: I gave up the course all together. Not a happy story. I cannot recommend this course at all."
1,Old fashioned and unfriendly,"This is like an old course i saw in a library some time ago where you accompany an imaginary learner who goes to the country. The old course was written by Leite in the 1980's, and you go with someone to Portugal. In this one you go with someone to Brazil. The problem i have with this style is that you are left out if you do not fit in with the imaginary characters. I also found that i did not learn much, nothing is really explained, just rushed through.I coudn't understand the tapes either."
4,Good set of images for Swedish/Scandanavian style,"The Taschen Icon books are great bargains, though this ""Style"" book was somehow less compelling than many of the others I've seen. Immerse yourself with great photography and simple, clean design."
5,All Time Classics,"Even in their original forms, both of these games have been on my hard drive since they first game out. With the exception of Elite, the Star Wars games were the first space sims to feel like you were actually flying in a 3D environment, not playing a 2D arcade game (sorry Wing Commander fans). Add 2 fantastic Star Wars story lines (both well fleshed out in the respective strategy guides), a chance to sample the overall lackluster sequel, updated graphics, and win 95 funtionality for under $20, and you can't go wrong. Freespace fans, check out the originals, and pick up Alliance. Its nice to see the series back on track."
3,Actually OK,"Written and directed by the man who wrote ""Heathers"", ""Happy Campers"" retains a few elements of that movie, such as voice-overs, a reference to Drano, and blue-tinted woods.However, where ""Heathers"" was a clever landmark film, ""Happy Campers"" is a just-OK, entertaining movie. It has enough humor in the usual teen-oriented jokes (bodily fluids/functions, sex and breasts), and pretty good looking women, to make it an enjoyable film.It is not really appropriate for younger teens, hence the ""R"" rating. No Oscar nominations in sight, but it could be much worse."
2,The Summoning,"While ""The Summoning"" is an engaging and creepy story, I felt disappointed after reading.The author did a great job of creating potentially interesting characters, but didn't develop them. There was one pivitol moment when a frustrated wife reveals the deep-seated root of her anger at her husband--he didn't accompany her to the doctor when she had a breast cancer scare the year before. However, the author dropped it after the revelation. You also have to suspend disbelief. Didn't any of the ""unaffected"" people of Rio Verde think the black church was odd? Why were some affected and others not? Was it some character flaw on their part? A husband notices his wife acting oddly, but doesn't protect his daughter. Finally, very little explanation was given about creature itself. Where did it come from? Why Rio Verde? Was there a link between it and the Wing family, or was it coincidence? I came away from this story with more questions than answers."
4,The Rev Rocks!,"Okay, I've only just got into the Rev after someone told me to check them out. Not a big rockabilly fan, neither country. But after reading some reviews got Liquor and Holy Roller. I actually like the mish mash of rockabilly, rock and punk influence. This album is more rock - which some people don't like. Me I think it's a bit like The Living End in spot (and you can see where they were influenced), but still has that jazz/country/rockabilly in it. Not as tongue in cheek and other albums but I like it!"
2,Different but not my cup of bourbon.,"The Rev comes back again with a heavy mix of songs but this sounds as if it was thrown together in a couple of days. Great instrumentals though. I'm a fan of changin it up but this is too much like metal. Not even psychobilly. ""Texas Rockabilly Rebel""....? Where? Stick to your roots Rev, we'll still love you."
1,Doom & Gloom book,"This is just another doom and gloom book. Since it's publication in July, 2003 property values in San Diego have risen another 20% and continue to rise. The author doesn't discuss the principle of supply and demand and why prices are rising - Lack of supply of land and enormous demand for housing. And the author doesn't touch on the many people who move to the high demand areas of California like San Francisco and San Diego - They come here with money and don't have to necessary rely on a mortgage. Will values decline? Probably. How much? Somewhat. When? No one knows; certainly more than two years from now. In the meantime those who have waited to buy are now facing an average median price of San Diego housing of $444,000; $575,000 to get a decent home. I am glad I read someone else's copy of this book instead of wasting my money."
1,Three hours of my life I am never going to get back,"I loved ""Amelia Earhart"". I looked forward to the release of this book. I read it in one night and returned it the next day. I just didn't want this drivel on my shelf and couldn't imagine passing it on to anyone else. Yes, Yes, it is a deep allegory about how we treat girls in our society. Maybe I am horrifically bourgeois for not leaping to my feet and praising this quasi-feminist rant, but regardless of the symbolism, tea made of tampons is just too much for me. Let us hope it is merely a sophmore slump for Ms. Mendelsohn."
3,Doesn't deliver the goods,"I enjoy Daisy Dalrymple books. This one has Daisy staying in New York, working on a series of articles about America for an American magazine. While there (here's a shocker!) she's a witness to a murder.OK, no problem. This now gives Dunn a reason to talk about America in the 1920's. She throws in Tammany Hall, J. Edgar Hoover, Prohibition, racial discrimination, the plight of the immigrant, etc, etc. I could put up with that, mostly, if there was a great plot. But there's not. The plot is rather thin. And the American dialect and jargon she throws in is so distracting that I kept losing sight of the story. I was really disappointed in this one. Please, Dunn, keep Daisy in England where she belongs!"
4,Comment from the Old South,I purchased this book for an eleven year old girl friend. Started to read it for suitability before I could make it a gift and couldn't put it down. It is a great story of courage and tenacity for overcoming adversity and will surely inspire young girls and boys alike. Must admit that I shed a tear at the end. Highly recommended. I'm 64.
1,MADE IN CHINA,This product is made in China!! Do not buy!! It is in little print on bottom of label. I want to return these. Will NOT order from this company again!
3,Not For TJ Owners,This is a very good general book about Jeeps. It(1998 edition) is totally lacking for TJ owners. If you are looking for specifics this is not the book for you.
2,More CJ than YJ or TJ,"The title and cover of this particular book leads one to believe that it really does cover information for the TJ. That is somewhat incorrect. The majority of the book is geared towards the CJ. Not really a problem, just understand that if you have a TJ, this is probably not the book for you.It is also written with heavy praise for Mopar parts and accessories.A Chilton's Manual would probably be a better purchase."
5,perhaps C$C's finest,"It's a toss-up in my mind whether Release or the sadly out-of-print White Noise is Cop Shoot Cop's best album. Of the two, Release is certainly the more accessible, though an accessible C$C album is by no means easy listening. The band infamous for their no-guitar approach bring in a guitarist for their final outing, as well as other incongruous instruments such as harmonica or trumpet. Also, Jim Coleman plays the piano a lot more on this album than in previous ones. However, Cop Shoot Cop's sound is still basically the same: dual bass attack, harsh banging drums, unsettling samples and gritty lyrics sung gruff. This is the easiest album of the band's to find, so by all means pick it up. Also, consider checking out the band members' disparate new projects: Firewater, Here, Phylr and Red Expendables."
2,book review,It was an OK read. Read it for book club and we all decided that the main character was quite egocentric . We also wanted to know more about the sister who died of cancer than was revealed in the book.
1,Juat plain bad....it obviously pays to have famous friends..,"I had very high hopes for this book, especially with all the great reviews it has received. It began with promise, but quickly plummeted into a book so dull, that I found myself skimming through paragraphs just to get through the page. It just seems that this book may not have even been published had it not been for the author's connections. Save yourselves some money and read something more fulfilling....like your phonebook."
3,Wait for the paperback,"I saw this book and amazon and read through a couple of reviews and decided to give it a try.It is a quick and entertaining ready, which I enjoyed, but didn't love.The idea of the novel being told through letters seemed like a good idea until I got into the book. I never was able to buy into the fact that this LA based, hard working Hollywood woman, would actually write these letters. Who writes letters in this day and age. The book mentions a few reasons throughout the novel as why she chooses this means of communications, but it often feels forced. Personally, I believe this aspect of the novel took me away from the story, because I kept thinking - why wouldn't she write an e-mail, pick up a phone, etc.Overall, it is an entertaining novel but I would wait till it comes out on paperback or borrow from a friend."
2,Just okay,"This book was just okay. If I hadn't been reading it for a book club, I wouldn't have continued beyond the first 50 pages. It simply didn't grab me. The story, being told through letters written by 'Olivia,' is really somewhat narrow in character development. Olivia's character is well developed, but the remaining character's were developed only minimally. I would have loved to have known more about her sister, father, mother and brother (whose character is barely even addressed, let alone developed). Furthermore, Olivia's character was not very likeable and certainly not one to whom I could relate. I laughed two or three times, but other than that this book didn't strike much emotion in me even though I have a good friend battling cancer. The author just fails to get into the meat of anything other than a character who is presumably based on herself."
3,Not quite outstanding,"I had no knowledge of either the plot or the author upon delving into this book. I found the second half much better than the first and the ""theme"" of chasing windmills interesting. What I didn't find interesting were the letters regarding the movie being made. I found myself skipping over these.Even without knowing the author's life story, I could figure out how things for Olivia and Maddie were going to turn out. The humor was not all that funny although it was obvious that the author had a meaningful relationship with her own sister. If there was strength in this story, it came from Olivia's self-reflections and lessons she learned from Maddie. I found myself wanting more from these characters than I received."
3,disappointing,"this novel has all the elements that would usually make me love a book..family tragedy, humor, a look into the ridiculous hollywood universe...but something about it just didn't click. it was beyond predictable and i just didn't like reading a novel written entirely in letter form. this allowed for very poor character and plot development and there were none of the elaborate details that make a good book a great one. AND DON'T READ IT IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE STORY OF DON QUIXOTE...that's almost a bigger part of the novel that maddie's cancer! Come again Elizabeth."
4,A Humanist Novel,"4.5 stars. While I may have liked a little less name-dropping, overall I thought the book and its characters were true to life. I kept waiting for the miracle, the happy ending, the finding of god. But no, only a deepening of understanding about what it means to be human, that stuff happens, that people love each other and that life goes on. Oh, and you should take the risk, have faith in yourself and follow your dreams, because this is the only life you get, and you can't know what will happen until it happens. I enjoyed it. I even had some LOL moments."
5,"Funny, compelling, touching","This is a fantastic book! It's a fun, easy read that's still weighty enough to stay with you for a time after you've finished it. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll highlight lines of text that strike you as incredibly true."
1,crosstitchmary,This book is nothing but a collection of really bad letters. It was like reliving my Dad's cancer all over again. There was no enjoyment in reading this at all. Why Amazon.com recommended this for me is beyond my comprehension. I wouldn't recommend this book to my worst enemy. The only reason I read the entire book was because I was away from home and it was the only one I'd taken with me.
1,InsideKicking,I have an iMac and this cd won't run. I never received any response to my phone calls or emails to the company that sold the disc to me. Don't buy if you use a MAC!.
5,"The New Way to Learn Punting, Kicking, Snapping and Holding","Lee Hollingshead, Former Director of Youth League Training, Current Junior Varsity Assistant Coach:"" Awesome """
4,Broadly applicable guide to becoming a leader and growing others,"In many areas of human endeavor, from politics to business, leadership is the road to higher accomplishments. The best leaders groom future leaders, not just those near the top, but throughout the ranks of their organizations. Thus business leaders create ""winning organizations."" In his 1997 classic, reissued in 2002, best-selling author Noel M. Tichy, writing with researcher and consultant Eli Cohen, explains how leaders lead, how they function as true teachers, and how they ensure that worthy successors will follow them. While Tichy's real-world leadership examples from the 1990s may sport a few cobwebs, they offer timeless lessons. You can put these lessons into practice at your company using the handy workbook Tichy includes. getAbstract recommends this practical, insightful guide to those interested in leading and in teaching others to lead."
2,A fraud,"Billed as a memoir of ""The private life of rocket science"", this book is nothing of the kind. It dwells on the experiences of women and homosexuals in the space engineering field, and emphasizes their exclusion.Repetitively, M.G. Lord describes the field as masculine, and (heterosexual) male dominated.By veering off-course to the story of those who (obviously) weren't there, she spends very little time exploring those who were there, what they accomplished, and their ""private life"".""Astro Turf"" is not an unpleasant read, and it has a number of interesting stories to tell. However, it will be a great disappointment to anyone looking for the story it purports to tell."
1,SILENCED: International Journalists,"The topic is interesting, but most of the stories were very commonplace, involving disagreements between ownership and editorial policy. Compared with Into the Buzzsaw, a book dealing with the same topic, this one overemphasizes journalists' complaints; as such, the book obscures rather the big issue of freedom of the press."
5,One of Oke's Best,"Canadian West series has been one of my favorite Janette Oke books. She keeps her readers wanting more. I could not wait for the next book to come in, because I just had to know what happened! Great read for anyone that has time to sit down and read the four series book!My purchase came very quickly and I was satisfied with the book. Even though it was used, the book was in brand new condition!"
4,It works!,"We picked up a Coleman stove at a yard sale. It wasn't that old, but it was missing the regulator. We thought it would be easy and inexpensive to get a replacement but found the Coleman brand regulators carried by local suppliers were $50, about half the cost of a new stove. We were most relieved to find this unit on Amazon at a fraction of that price. After a little fiddling my husband got it installed and it works. We haven't had much opportunity to see how it works over the long haul, but so far, so good :)"
3,its just ok,it ok but its the worst quility element sweatshirt i've ever had. the decal fades very easy and its not the best sewing quility.
2,...She has way better,"I liked ""Case Of The Ex"" and loved ""Ghetto Supastar"" and ""Take Me There,"" so I figured why not check out her debut? I was very disappointed, the whole thing is really slow and uninspired R&B. Mya is at her best in her duets with other people (see ""Ghetto Supastar,"" ""Take Me There"" and ""Lady Marmalade""). Her two solo albums after this are alright, but this is painfully boring."
3,Mya is cool.,"If you like Robyn, Brandy, Monica, Sparkle, or Divine, you'll like Mya. Even though I haven't actually listened to the whole CD, I think she has a good voice and cool songs."
4,a Killing Spring,"A Killing Spring is one in a series featuring Joanne Kilbourn, a Canadian college professor, as the amateur sleuth. There is a nice density to these mysteries: the reader is always aware of Joanne's full life--we see her with her children, her friends, as a political woman (her deceased husband was in politics), as well as with students in and out of the classroom. The mystery itself is good and Joanne's investigation of it quite believable--only at the end does she become improbably active. Gail Bowen is a good writer, and the depth of the mystery and Joanne's life gives the book a rich quality; the final scene is lovely. Joanne does have a romantic relationship with a policeman (as do many female amateur detectives). The policeman is a Native Canadian, and the two must deal with prejudice in this book. Joanne feels she has never before experienced prejudice, an astonishing belief, I thought, for a liberal woman. I highly recommend this mystery."
4,Herbert,"I havent bought this CD yet or anything by them, only listened to the samples. If you like this check out Goodbye Swing Time by Herbert. Its big band acid jazz very similar to this style. Some of his other stuff is great too."
2,paulrossjoe,the quality of the lenox brand is unsurpassed but the color was definately not white in comparison to other brands.
2,The Skinny,"These shoes do not look in person the way they look online. They are actually very narrow, and the toe curls up a bit. The shoes break in, right where the design is on the top, and this makes the shoe look bubbly at the top. A very uncomfortable shoe, that will spend its time in my closet, because it is skinny and uncomfortable. Shame on Mr. Cole for this one."
1,Don't buy this book if you are looking for color pictures.,"I'm very disappointed with this book. I will keep the book for its maps, but I don't believe it will be at all useful to identify the birds that visit my yard in the winter. The only color picture this book contains is on the cover. There are a very few photographs (black and white) and a very few drawings (also black and white). The maps may be helpful, but only when used together with some other book with color pictures."
3,Good rules but not very concise.,"While full of good advice that all of us need to be aware of and follow, the 25 rules are accompanied by much fluff that I feel add little.I enjoyed the many supporting quotes interspersed throughout the text.But if I have to read the word 'intercolotur' one more time I will probably mutter something quite uncivil. :)"
1,Bad Language,It's too bad that they have to ruin a good story with lanaguage entirely unsuited for children. I suppose with Eddie Murphy in it I should have known. I'm disappointed anyway.
1,"Is this a movie, or a PETA commercial?","This entire movie seems to be orchestrated by someone with EXTREME environmental views. The good Dr Doolittle must save the poor, defenseless animals of the forest from the evil Republican forest industry...>Why does the movie industry constantly attempt to steer our fertile minded children toward their own political views?"
1,EDDIE HATES ANIMALS......SO OBVIOUS,"Did you know that Eddie Murphy doesn't really like animals? Most of the scenes where him and animals were talking were taken separately, sometimes using a double. And that really showed, his acting was just not convincing.His lack of affection to the animals was just so obvious. Remember the scene when Eddie throws out the Rats? Those hands that holding them rats weren't even Eddie, that was a double.Why are the animals so human?? How come they never fight with other animals ? Also, so much ANIMAL-STEREO-TYPES. That was a FERRET, yeah I know that Ferrets are in the weasel Family but, you don't call animals by the specie....Its rude to Ferrets and Ferret owners. They should've called them ferrets. You don't say ""My canine Jack is bla blabla.....""Stupid dumb movie for simple-minded. Not a good movie for Animal lovers."
1,DVD with no human sound,"First I beleive that my DVD machine is not working,I changed to a new one and again Dr.Little2 and 3 have no human sound but music.I may return or gorget it."
5,Palm Trees & Power Lines,"Palm Trees & Power Lines is a great release from Sugarcult, who we heard of last year with their 'Start Static' album. This is just as good, if not much better, than their last album. The hit 'Memory', which was already playing on local stations before the release of their new album Tuesday, April 13th.Personally I LOVED their new CD. The variety of music, tones, and altogether wonderful-ness was amazing. I really do enjoy the CD and can't wait for Sugarcult to come out with their next one!"
4,Awsome CD,"This is a great CD. Nothing like Simple Plan so I would like it if other reviewers would not compare them to them. Simple Plan is the gayest most manufactured band I've ever heard. But enough about them...If you like bands like the Used,New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, you will really like this cd. Many great songs. I don't know why people keep talking about Champange..I mean it's an alright song...but theres better ones. Well Hope this review helped"
3,Sophomore Slump,"Is this what they call a ""sophomore slump?"" Well, partly. Out of all 13 songs, the first five on Sugarcult's second record are just as catchy as their entire last record, but it ends there. Tracks 6-12 are just plain bad. ""Champagne,"" for example, is bland at its best parts, and has filler written all over it. The high points? Definitely the two singles, ""Memory"" and ""She's The Blade."" ""Crying"" is everything you loved about the first record, but better. ""Back To California"" is a slow acoustic ballad about the end of a summer fling and returning home to normal life, and is easily the best song on here. ""Sign Off,"" the last song on the record, makes skipping half the record worth it. The lyrics aren't incredible, but it has a good message and the melody is pretty catchy. Bottom line: this would have been a lot better as an EP."
5,awesomely awesome,words can't explain how much this CD rocks. the music is different from their other stuff which i LOVE because i'm sick of bands (like linkin park & dashboard confessional) whose music all sounds the same. i went to sugarcult's show two days ago & they didn't disappoint me whatsoever. palm trees & power lines is definately a CD i'm recommending to EVERYONE.
4,Good CD even though...,"First off, Start Static was better. That said, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with this CD. It's got some emo moments and I hate emo, but that's me. As far as pop music goes (there is no such thing as pop-punk, no matter what you guys say-it's pop or it's punk) this is more or less the only pop band I listen to these days anyway.Champagne is a great song, as is Worst December. What You Say is the pits, Counting Stars is too emo for me. Destination Anywhere is good, She's the Blade is good, Memory is good. The others are good enough.It seems like they just got really depressed when writing the songs for this CD. Hopefully the next one goes back to Start Static type tunes."
1,Quite a ridiculous book,"I am shocked that so many people found this book to be worthy of even a precious minute. The story is so incredibly ridiculous. I could hear the seriousness in the author's voice, so I know it wasn't meant to be an amusing story, but I found myself laughing the whole time. In fact, the book and its events and characters got so ludicrous at one point that I put the book down and never regretted it, never wondered what happened to these stupid people. What happened to good, believable fiction? I've read more convincing books about leprechauns!"
1,am i the only one who hates this book?,"I have to read this for my book group, and I am suffering. It is boring, and goes on and on about nothing. Although I am normally fascinated by books about people with mental illness(The Madness of a Seduced Woman is my favorite novel), this one is full of boring thoughts from a boring man, and I am not enjoying it! There is nothing to pique my interest. Does anyone else think this book is just a narcissistic monologue? Kind of like a way too long blog."
1,One of the worst books I ever read,"If you liked Camus' The Stranger you'll like this book. Otherwise, avoid it. Boring and pointless."
4,Enduring Love was a fast and exciting read.,"Enduring Love by Ian McEwan was a fast and enjoyable read. While trying to help out in a hot -air balloon accident, Jed Perry falls in love with Joe Rose (narrator). Perry's love for Rose, a happily married writer, turns in to a dangerous obsession. I really enjoyed when McEwan would write about Roses' science magazine pieces. It was an interesting way to set up the fact that Rose was a complete realist. The books greatest accomplishment is the way it makes the reader doubt himself. Between Rose, Perry, and Clarrisa (Rose's wife) sometimes it is hard to know who has their sanity. The content of the Appendixes really pull the book together. I really liked the fact that McEwan put that last bit of information in the appendix. Overall the book was a great read but I'm not sure it left me with much to think about."
4,Intelligent and well-written little story,"Just finished Enduring Love and I enjoyed it. It is not really that suspensful or chilling, but Mr. McEwan is one writer who respects his reader's intelligence and that alone is high praise in my book with so much drivel around. I enjoyed not knowing myself whether Joe was the one who was going bananas or if in fact he was the only one who saw that Jed was really dangerous. Reminded me a bit of Bunker Man only not nearly as dark and horrific as that novel."
2,"""Dressed Up"" Thriller that's actually conventionally cheesy","I expected this book to be a lot more clever and psychologically probing/provocative than it actually was. Which is why I totally misread what was going on (much to my disappointment). Without giving too much away, throughout most of the novel, I thought Parry was just a figment of the increasingly erratic and paranoid narrator's imagination. His creation of Parry stemming from his midlife career/identity crisis and fear of commitment. I kept going back and forth: Is/isn't Parry real? I thought that was fascinating and was unpleasantly surprised that it was just a mundane ""Fatal Attraction"" type thriller. I was truly annoyed. Don't get me wrong. It was well-written, especially the first chapter (which has already been stated many times.) But as psychologically insightful and twisty, it left a lot to be desired."
2,Not as advertised,"I must disagree with everyone's adulation of Enduring Love. It was difficult to care about any of the characters. Parry's obsession comes out of the blue. The balloon accident means nothing to the real point of the story. Really, I hated these characters. Is this any achievement in writing? I think not."
2,I finally finished it,This book has all the ingreidents for a fine book' a grief stricken marshall; a woman wanting to change for the better; a good basic story line. But the constant bickering in the first two thirds of the book is so monotonous I lost interest in the book to the point reading the last third a chore. The book probably would have been better at half it's length.
1,Unbelievably bad!,"""There wasn't a man alive she couldn't charm, seduce, or just plain outsmart."" The plot of this book revolves around Fancy Holleday, a former whore, who is supposedly so amazing she can use all her wiles against any man and win. Yet, she is thinking the quote listed above as she is walking in freezing temperatures after her lover tried to kill her during their train robbery when she was no longer useful. Then, she was left to freeze to death by another outlaw she had saved from certain death at this very same train robbery. She may have been good at seducing men, but this character proved her idiocy within the first two chapters. The dialogue in this book is horrible, and it left me cringing and shaking my head. This is undoubtedly one of the worst books I've ever read. Fancy describes the Marshall's legs as ""stumpy and bowed"". Was I seriously supposed to get into this romance when now I think the love interest is short, bow-legged, and looks like a weathered cowpoke?"
5,Great devotional book for my 4 year old,I received this book as a gift and my little girl loves it. I love it too. The stories are relatable; and I especially like the questions and bible scripture at the end of each chapter. Great for teaching right and wrong and great for learning as well. Wish I could give more than 5 stars.
3,"New version is a whimper, but still quite good","OMG, I can not believe I am about to say this.Giorgio is wonderful & so much better than I remember her. She's pretty heavy on the white florals, but she's notgirlie-girlie. She's a spry, yet refined, California woman with a backbone.I already own Giorgio Red and Giorgio Blue, and I wear both frequently. I'm not sure why it took me so long to testthe original again. OK, maybe not-so-original, but the not-so-new formulation by P&G; Prestige Beaute. (Now theGBH brand is owned by Elizabeth Arden.) However, I do remember the intensity & sillage of the original, & theP&G; version is a whimper in comparison."
4,"Sharp beginning, sweet middle and smooth dry-down","I have, in the past, used Primo, which is a knock-off version of this fragrance. I found a bottle of Giorgio on sale and decided to try the real thing. This is a nice fragrance, albeit a bit sharp on the outset, notes of gardenia, honeysuckle and orange flower blended with tones of jasmine, rose and sandalwood, oakmoss and patchouli. The honeysuckle and jasmine are what give it the sharpness, while the rose and sandalwood combine to give a nice, lingering dry-down. I am somewhat bothered by the initial sharpness of the scent, but it doesn't last too long and I love the dry-down, which does last for a long time. Definitely a fragrance I can recommend for women who like a classic-type scent."
3,"It's good, not as good as others Maiden's Albuns.","As I said, it's good. You can't compare this album with Powerslave, Fear of the Dark, Somewhere in Time or ( I'm not kidding )The X Factor.Blaze Bayley's voice is limited, he can't reach that Bruce Dickinson's ""screams"". Futureal is good. The Angel and the Gambler could be better if it weren't so repetitive. The Clansman is good, but could be better without that ""freedom"". The other songs are good but Como Estais Amigo, wich is the worst Maiden's song. I feel like crying when I listen to it. But, as we know, THE BRUCE IS BACK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ( ADRIAN TOO )"
3,A decent maiden album,"Well Virtual XI is a step up from the X factor. Blaze's voice improved over the last couple years and the songs are pretty decent. But Blaze still cannot compare to Bruce, who thankfully is back with maiden along with the great guitarist Adrian Smith. I think that maiden made a great choice to get rid of Blaze and get Bruce back because they are so much better with Bruce."
1,"Yeah, great....","This album is so ""great"" that, after it, Steve Harris and manager Rod Smallwood fired singer Blaze Bayley and begged for Bruce Dickinson and guitarrist Adrian Smith to come back to the band...."
1,Don't waste your money on plastic,I bought this exact tortilla press and the handle broke on the third tortilla! That's what I get for trying to save a few bucks.
1,***TOTAL JUNK****,"I picked one of these up at a local Big Lots for $5.99. The plastic seemed pretty heavy and sturdy to me. BOY WAS I WRONG! I mixed up the dough according to the recipe on the corn masa bag, separated it into 16 little lumps, put the first lump of dough in the press, pressed down the handle, and CRACK!!! The handle snapped right off and pieces went flying! I kept using it as best I could, pushing it down without the handle with the weight of my body. What was I to do? I had 15 more little piles of corn masa dough! I managed to squash out 13 extra small, extra thick tortillas with the crippled press then CRACK!! The hinge at the back broke. Aagh! I had to roll the last one out by hand. I'd give this thing a negative score if I could!!! If I could find an email address for these guys they'd certainly hear from me! I'm just glad I only burnt $5.99 on the thing. Take my advice- AVOID THIS PRODUCT!"
1,very uncomfortable,"i bought 2 of this earplugs little did i know that they are so hard, it really hurt your ears.i will never buy it again"
3,stroller,My daughter has alot of fun with this doll stroller. She wheels her dolls around the house in it. Thank you.
1,Storage,"its a good idea however the hanger part is plastic and it breaks, or pulls off they seem to leak easilyand have to keep vacuuming them...they just need more work...good idea I end up with them under the bed"
1,all good things will one day suck,"rent seasons 1-4. they are the best but after that it all went down hill. it is also to note in this redemption jack once again fights a helichopter. WTF> its liike the billionth one to come accross his path. the acton sets with jack were well done but like most years too sparce and in between, and all those new characters seem remnisent of the circus that was season five."
3,Just another episode,"I watched all 8 seasons of 24 on Amazon Prime. there was a small gap between season 7 and 8 and since I was being OCD about watching it I had to buy this.Not really worth the money, same formula as the other shows and nothing new was added to the overall story line"
3,24 Redemption,"Never watched it while it was running, but we are addicted to 24 now. We were confused with the 1st episode of the 7th season and discovered that this ""movie"" aired before the season and filled in the blanks, so we ordered it even though we thought it should stream free like the rest of the series. It was OK, but a little ho hum compared to the regular episodes. I expected more. Really, I wouldn't have minded if it was $1.99 or $2.99, but not the $7.99 I paid."
2,"okay, but not the best.","After reading it, I didn't feel that I really related to it..it focused to much on the typical girl teen-and most girls arn't typical by someone else's standards. These kinds of books are supposed to encourage being yourself- but the vibe i got from this book was rather the opposite."
4,MEDLOCKE IS BLACKFOOT,MEDLOCKE IS BLACKFOOT. NO OFFENSE TO GREG WALKER AND THE OTHERS. I'M NOT POSITIVE IF THIS WAS MEANT TO BE A SOLO ALBUM OR NOT BUT MEDLOCKE DID TOUR WITH THE NAME BLACKFOOT BEFORE RECORDING THE ALBUM. THE ALBUM IS MORE 80'S RADIO BUT IT'S TONS BETTER THEN THE SMILES ALBUM. STILL NOT GREAT THOU. THE BEST SONG IS 'HER PRIVATE LIFE'. YOU SHOULD BUY IT IF YOU LIKE BLACKFOOT/MEDLOCKE
1,For Completists Only!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"Let me say that this is NOT a Blackfoot album. It is Rickey Medlocke and some other people. It does not even remotely sound like Blackfoot. It doesn't even sound like rock 'n' roll. It is weak, cheesy, '80's pop music. I don't know what Rickey was thinking on this one. He got it right on the next one though. I wish Wounded Bird would re-release the ""Medicine Man"" CD. That one is worth every penny."
4,Please enter a title for your review,"Random rentals are a 50/50 bet for me as to whether they'll be engagingly watchable and this one was in the good 50. It's not an amazingly solid script but it's effective as a ""me and you against the world"" type thing."
1,Muddled Group of Songs,"I am one of the premiere fans of Michael Franks. However Barefoot On The Beach, as with his last album, fail in one primary category - strong melody. Listen to this album and see if you can retain one melody line. Now listen to ""Your Secrets Safe With Me"" and see if you can remember the melody. No contest. These new melodies are so convoluted and sometimes delivered in a whispered voice, the listener cannot retain the melodic structure - an obvious key in liking a pop song. If I wanted plain ""mood"" I'll listen to environmental sounds. Michael, I want a song I can remember."
2,Not as good as I thought,"As the other reviewer said it does smell like bug spray (crossed with pickles)in the beginning. It does smell better after a little while, but not an extraordinary smell by any means, nothing distinctive and that would make you want to rush out and buy another bottle. Generic classic perfume."
3,Simply a soggy piece of cheese.,"There is very little good to offer in Leviathan, Jerry Goldsmith contributes the usual excellent score, but that is about it - despite being trapped with a monster, which is a pretty unispired (and hardly seen) guy in a suit, the story never really catches fire. If you are like me and enjoy watching laughably silly cinematic misfires like this, then by all means check it out. If not, and you've seen both Alien and John Carpenter's The Thing, then skip it, you won't miss it at all."
2,Attack of the Killer Mutated Piranha People!,"If you enjoy watching genetic alteration of people turning into els and eventually growing into a Giant Piranha with arms and legs, than this movie is for you. The story has been done alot before and those movies were better made (The Fly, The Thing, etc) You get to see the creature in the last 10 minutes which is a disapointment because its not even that well done and too many quick shots, hardly ever get a good look at it. I think the part with the sharks trying to attack them and Peter Weller punching out Meg Foster at the very end of the movie was more entertaining than the rest of the movie itself."
1,Leviathan's a shipwreck,"What happens when you mix one hundred percent 'Alien' with fifty percent 'The Thing' add a dash of 'The Abyss' and add no originality of your own? Voila! You get Leviathan. This montage (montage is putting it very, very nicely) of 'Alien', 'The Thing', and 'The Abyss' doesn't even try to hide the fact that it is a rip-off of all three sci-fi classics. Instead, Leviathan unabashedly tries to make money, almost scene for scene, off retred ideas and comes up flat. Not even the all-star cast (how did the producers get Peter Weller and Richard Crenna to sign their names to this?) and an ineffectual Jerry Goldsmith score can save this shipwreck."
2,stylish but poor quality,"Overall i found it hard to listen to this for longer than twenty minutes. It is too well produced with over the top production. Having said that Macey Gray, Lisa Lefteye Lopes and Ja Rule did stand out in comparison to the other pointless songs used to fill up this disc.Three songs stayed in my head, the rest i found poor and disapointing. declan2006"
5,The illest MC ever born,"This man is just too nice with his words. He is verbally unstoppable! The first time I heard the man's name I thought he was corny, but you can't judge a book by it's cover. As soon as my brother showed me some of his songs I was HOOKED!! All his words were just incredible. He just never stopped spitting. Truly is one of the greatest rappers of all time. Don't Hate! This man will Spit a sentence that will make you cry!"
5,The Illest MC,"After listening to CAN-I-BUS, I knew I was hooked. No other rapper spoke, even less imagined the things that come out of Canibus' mouth. The man is a genius. 2000 B.C. was a worhty sequel for him. I truly enjoyed the first one, and 2000 B.C. just kept it going for me. Tracks like ""Mic-Nificent"" and ""100 Bars"" will show you what this kid is about. Get the album, you will not...repeat...will not be dissapointed!!!Neo101"
4,2000 B.C. is the best yet!,"Without a doubt, Canibus has come through with this incredible album that leaves his freshman LP in the dust. With new hardcore hip-hop hits like ""Mic-Nificent"" and ""Lost @ C,"" Canibus is going to show the world that no one can match his lyrical ammunition and no one can get in his way. 2000 B.C. features a solid 14 track playlist that will keep your home stereo or auto system begging for more, more, more! The album features a track with the microphone master Rakim, among others including Kurupt, Ras Kass, and Journalist. This is one album that must be picked up by all hip-hop fans."
4,Canibus 2000 B.C.,"The new Canibus is worth the money this time. Might be a sleeper because of his first joint. Different producers ranging from Irv Gotti to DJ Clue and having a few cameo appearences didn't hurt either(Rakim, Ras Kass, Kurupt,and Pharoahe Monch). This album was indeed a come up with Bus showing you when it comes to lyrics he's blazin."
4,"Not bad, Canibus has about reached his potential","He's gifted lyrically, poetically, and with great intelligence.Where he loses me is the lack of substance. You can only rap about how great you are and how bad everyone else is for so long. Eventually you have to have something related to street life, or something that the streets identify with.I really don't know what it is in particular that doesn't do it for me, but someone with as much lyrical skill and intelligence as Canibus should be reigning at the top.He's nice, but without something to really get me going, he'll only receive marginal rotation in my changer."
1,oh,"When I saw that this album had fifteen songs, I was so happy. But Emilie only sings on five songs! That's ridiculous. The rest are instrumental songs. You are wasting money on this album. And for forty dollars. Why is this album so much money? It's not worth it!"
4,W.A.S.P.-'Double Live Assassins'(CMC International) 2-CD,"Haven't seen or heard much about W.A.S.P. in awhile now,but I know they still exist.'Double Live...' is a good 2-CD release that was recorded live on their 1997 tour.Have heard a few old school fans comment this record is pretty lame.I didn't get that at all from 'Double...' If anything,it's just longer than any set I've ever seen Blackie Lawless and the boys play in concert.Duration is 101 minutes.Tracks I couldn't get enough of were ""On Your Knees/I Don't Need No Doctor"",their once banned single ""Animal(F**k Like A Beast)"",""Love Machine"",""I Wanna Be Somebody"",their cover of The Who's ""The Real Me"",""Headless Children"" and ""Mean Man"".Yes,I do realize there are several cuts from their self-titled debut lp here.What a powerful metal band!I mean for a bunch of Alice Cooper wanna be's."
5,it's a family thang,"Many MANY props to you, Sylk-E. Fyne ... although we don't know each other, she is my blood cousin-which may make y'all think that i'm a lil biased, but i'm not ... my cousin is RAW. Ma, if you ever read this, just know that you have a cousin who's supporting you. and if ya wondering how i'm ya cousin, uncle Art-your grandpa-is my Gran Gran's (your aunt Ozelle) brother. and i'm Gary's daughter.Keep it raw gyrl.love always, Salathia Scott"
3,"Not bad, not good","If you are a Greg Bear fan, then you will enjoy this book. Other than that, I believe the reading public will not be so enthralled. This is the follow-up to The Forge of God. The Forge of God is a true masterpiece, Anvil of Stars is not. The Earth is destroyed, the good guys are going to get the bad guys, and the law is the law. That is all you need to know for this book and you know it early. Bear tries to develop believable characters which he succedes at very nicely. The problem here is the story itself, which seems very disoriented and the story never seems to gel no matter how he tries to study group dynamics or species interactions. The main characters are the children of the original survivors of The Forge of God, which is a nice touch with a different view of the problem. You could do a lot worse than Anvil of Stars, but you can do a lot better also."
3,Not very good,"This book has an interesting subject, generally unknown to me, but when it discussed things I do know about, I found many errors (e.g., Gerald Ford was defeated in the election of 1976, not 1975). The author does not seem overly familiar with the English language (""decapitated head""?) I could provide many more example of each complaint. There must be a better book on Afghanistan out there."
1,What's displayed is not what wa received.,My neighbor has the rake shown. I orderedyours but what I received is nothing likewhat's shown. The one I wanted is shown.The one I received rakes head was small andineffective if used to pull deep snow off onesroof. Returned absolutely untouched. Hopewe get our full refund.
3,It works but,"It is pretty flimsy if you add all 3 extensions. I have not yet done so. I added two and I really think that is all it can handle. If there is a lot of snow on the roof, it feels even with two that is will break. Although, it did do as it was designed, I think it would have performed better had I had it for the first snow. I did have about 7"" on the roof before the first use."
5,Recommended by Christian Medical and Dental Assoc.,"This book needs to be read by all healthcare students and professionals considering short-term missions service. It brings together extensive experience around the world, and comprehensive research in helps and resources. Every chapter flows from the Steffes' service in small clinics to large mission hospitals, in primitive remote ministries to established ""full-service"" institutions, and in being the only doctor in the area to a fellow worker on the team. The writers thoughtfully lay before the reader how to take along the family, even a family with small children. Certain to be a ""top-of-the-list"" resource for those looking at short-term medical missions. Spiral bound, 8 1/2 x 11 notebook. 249 pages. Great for reference study!"
3,"Not bullet-proof, but if it stays in the shop it will do","For the money this tool chest does what I need it to do. I keep it inside my RC plane trailer where it contains small tools and spare parts. It is not heavy-duty, and the drawer locking mechanism does not engage very cleanly. I keep keep a ratchet strap over it as a safeguard to prevent the drawers from sliding open when the cover is closed."
4,Great Gift!,I ordered this for my husband for our one year anniversary. He is a mechanic on submarines and so he had all these random tools laying around. The same hour he got it he organized all of his tools and now they are not just sitting in our garage!His favorite feature is that the drawers only open if the lid is opened. This prevents spillage of tools. He loves it!
1,Where are the Exericise Solutions?,"This book explains things fairly well. I would have rated it a 3 or 4, but they forgot the most important thing: THE SOLUTIONS TO THE PRACTICE PROBLEMS!!!!! Where are they??? Without the solutions to the practice problems a technical textbook is pretty much useless!"
2,What a disappointment...,"This product has the potential to be tremendous, but due to poor packaging design the inside of the plastic was scratched. That absolutely ruins the iPod video experience, now that there is LCD glare exposing all the scratches.Also, there is a big 'rhigo-skin' logo on the front, which makes the case even that more distracting.I'm sure that it isn't polycarbonate because it scratches with my fingernail.What a letdown.P.S. if you are buying the 30GB version of this case, it will double the thickness of your setup."
2,ok but not what it used to be,"i still watch it, but its not at all what it was in season 1, way better than season 2,has its moments but is wildly uneven and i cant seem to understand any direction they are taking,but i believe season 4 will def determine if u can save this show or just give up on it.ps: i HATE the shameless plugs of verizon and nissan!!"
3,Get to the point,"I'm hooked on this show but when will it get to the point, or any point, stop jerking us around.I'd buy it again... because I'm hoping the show gets to the point."
1,There is only season one,"Even if you think you want to watch more heroes, it is better if you pretend that season one is the only season."
4,Heroes DVD,Brother got me hooked on this series.I have been watching it on Netflix but bought it for him for a Christmas gift.
3,Heroes Vol 3,"This column of Heroes kept my attention most of the time, but nothing like 1and 2. It almost seemed at times like they were grabbing at creative straws and just making it up as they went along."
3,Pretty to look at,"By third season I think that I was just along for the ride, Heroes always ""looked"" good but always fell short of its potential, at least this one rises above what Season Two was turning itself into. If you like scifi / fantasy you can find some good bits here, but the ""bargain bin"" might still be the way to go. My set advertises ""over 20 hours of bonus features""- that would be the best reason to watch this season ( and even that doesn't explain dropping so many second season characters like Claire's flying boyfriend)."
5,Very Happy,After a fender bender the assembly on one side was replaced and it really showed how badly fogged and discolored the remaining old one was. So I replaced with this one. The product fit perfectly and it came with all the bulbs already installed (I didn't realize they were included). I compared carefully to the old one I extracted and could not find any differences. Time will tell how long till it begins to fog - but it can't be any worse than the original that came with the vehicle. Very happy with product and price. Car looks refreshed now.
2,Not much humour for a humourist,"Grizzard is a little bit of a throwback-- his writing here has the nostalgic ring of a ""Truly Tasteless Jokes"" compilation, or a bout of joke-telling amongst beer-swilling buddies.Which is to say that most of the humor is very broad, and very stale. Other reviewers have commented on his insight, but I didn't really get that.Many of the jokes are straight-up stolen from other sources, or paraphrase jokes that have been making the rounds for decades.Of course, there will always be a market, a very large market, for lowest-common-denominator schtick that is bland enough to prevent the raising of hackles. That is the very premise that allows many columnists (and columnists-turned-book-writers) to earn a living.As Jeff Foxworthy might say-- ""If a book by Lewis Grizzard makes you laugh from the first page to the last, you might just be a redneck!"""
2,NO JAPANESE AUDIO TRACK,"In episodes 22 and 23, there was no Japanese audio, both tracks were in English.This is so bad. Is it possible for VIZ VIDEO to resend the complete disk to users?Otherwise, I can not order the next episodes box set."
4,"slow delivery, good product","The book itself is going to be very useful, just what I was looking for. The delivery on the other hand took two weeks from shipment day to get to me, I realize that they call it snail mail, but didn't think they went that slow...4 stars for the book, minus one for delivery! Good thing I have a little patience."
3,Typical IT manual,The manual was pretty much the same as other IT publications I've seen. Lot's of information but not really a lot of detail for any one specific model. They try to cover too many models with one book and don't really detail any one of them well. In the absence of a dedicated overhaul manual for your specific tractor I guess it's OK.
1,There are better products out there,"I strongly recommend you consider a different product, such as Acid Hip Hop, instead. Acid is a more flexible program, with a tempo that is adjustable during the song and with more simultaneous tracks (eJay has only 8), and it also has better samples.I was hoping that the scratch editor would make this worth using, but it's totally broken. I was totally unable to get decent sounds out of it, and I *have* been able to get decent scratching out of other programs.I simply cannot recommend this program to anyone."
3,It's worth the price,"This is not a great video for a beginner, but for someone who is already a little familiar with BD I think it's fine. I think it is worth the $20 I paid for it.Someone who is brand new to BD might be better off with Magical Motion, or K. Furgesons beginner video.There is a full review on this video at Shira's website if you need more info."
5,Belly Dance Your Way to Your Soul Mate,"It's impossible to describe the deep feelings and emotions generated in this performance.You must see to appreciate, capture and live the moments.Thanks to Amira's easy instructions....The woman of my life captured my heart!"
2,Behind technology--good for the '90's,Get a newer book. . . unless you're still using a typewriter. So much more out there now.
3,good but if these walls could talk 2 are better,This movie was not daring the second one was it was not as out there as this one is which in my oppineon is a good thing. If these walls could talk is ok but if these walls could talk two is a must see.
1,An awful portrayal,"I will never in this lifetime understand why any mother would believe that killing her own child would be in anyone's best interests (including her own). Biology and Physiology are simple subjects...there are no anatomical changes of a baby after 8 weeks (most abortions are performed at 12 weeks), the baby only gets bigger. Basically what the rest of the reviewers are saying is that the bigger the person is physiologically, the more of a person they are. A person is a person whether they are one pound or a thousand pounds. Many people have much more difficult complications in their lives other than pregnancy. Only two categories exist, the uneducated and the profiteers, many whom which enjoy performing abortions at 40 weeks. So many people can't have children, I don't understand the gross selfishness. I'm so glad my mother didn't think of me like this."
1,Don't buy this poster,I'm very disappointed. The poster did arrive on time... but what a unpleasant surprise to find out that it was just a CHEAP PRINTED COPY of an scanned image. MOVIEGOODS: Shame on you!!
3,Needs to be a little more developed.,"Good background information. I feel that it should have more examples. Especially under the subject/verb agreement section. Some of our peoples most notorious errors are omitted. For example, when to use do and does, don't and doesn't, did and done, or seen and saw. I don't thank that the people who need the book most will be able to make the connection by themselves. I love the concept of the book, but it just needed a little more developed."
3,"IT'S OKAY, BUT.......","SOME OF THE TOOLS THE I RECEIVED WERE NOT OF GOOD QUALITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE HANDLE ON THE TOE NAIL CLIPPER BROKE. TRUST ME, MY TOE NAILS ARE NOT THAT HARD YET! THE CLIPPERS ARE REALLY DULL. I COULD HARDLY CUT MY FINGERNAILS. ONCE AGAIN, MY NAILS ARE NOT THAT HARD YET!HOWEVER, I DO LIKE THE NAIL FILE! IT IS SHAPED LIKE A FISH!I HOPE THAT THIS REVIEW HELPS SOMEONE DECIDE FOR THEMSELVES!"
2,Disappointing book offer little beyond aircraft photos.,"While the photo's are nice, the book offers little insight into the inside operations or history of ORD. Literally no coverage of the old terminals or behind the scenes glimpses.....strictly for planespotters. Nothing I couldn't get by visiting the place as a passenger with a few hours to spare."
2,Advueu PD710 woes,"From the time I opened the box (ecost.com $135) it seemed to be OK...But when I hooked up the the AC adapter one end to the unit I had to wiggle it to make it work. Definetely no quality control, since I'm an Electronic Tech I soldered the socket on the unit. Of course I voided warranty since I did not want the hassles of sending it back.Works fine now. I would not recommend it, go for the brand name."
1,this sucked!!!,I opened the package and the plastic clip disintegrated in my hands. Now it is useless. This sucks!-David
5,NOW WE ARE TALKING!,"So we are at last getting the classic show ""Ed, Edd,'n' Eddy"" on full season sets. It is about time. I suggest you shoud start with this and then get the other seasons when they come out. Everyone shoud try this show, for it is the true definition of cartoon comedy."
4,Gaming Mouse Pad Review,HandStands Zero Gaming Mouse Pad MatGood mouse pad. It's hard so it can be used from the couch or bed and or on your lap. Mouse glides really nicely on it.
3,Wears out fast....3 months,"This Mouse pad worked wonderful....for the first 3 months or so. Then the ""slickness"" wore off and it became a regular mouse pad with the usual friction on the mouse.I do a lot of gameing and art work and while it works great when new, eventually it reverts to the feel of a regular pad. It would be nice if they offered a spray to re-slick the surface.I bought it for half price ( I think it was 12 bucks or so) and for that price it was ok. Certainly not worth $30.00 for such a short time use of a really friction free surface."
3,Mouse Pad is Good,"It's good, but personally I prefer other brands like Razer and SteelSeries. This one was just too thick for my preference, and the coating didn't seem to last as long as the other two brand (though it still lasted a while). For the price, though, it's not a bad deal."
3,Just so so.,"I have to admit this mouse mat is good size for playing games, but when I use it to play games, my wrist does not feel comfortable."
1,Crap,"THIS IS NOT EVEN A ONE STAR!Waste of money, obsolete battery charged properly per directions but still won't hold a charge, after 3 small home repairs battery won't charge at all. Customer service said it was my fault."
3,Too tough,The attitude to 'tough it all out' that the author has is a little extreme. Losing a leg is a big deal.
5,Putting the Christ back in Christmas (Stellarly!),"As a member of Christ Church Cathedral's choir, and a longstanding opponent of the commercialization of Christmas, I wholeheartedly recommend this album as something special this Christmas season. From a truly remarkable O Holy Night, as sung by the award winning soprano, Mary Wilson, to personal favorites, such as the Coventry Carol, this album is a delight from start to finish, including, in addition, congregational hymns, so as to point towards Christ's true family. This album keeps Christmas music sacred, as it was intended, and is a delight to listen to year round. Stick this in someone's stocking, they'll be glad you did..."
5,What is a Bottlefly? Why it's a BESTSELLER!,"Aside from the circus,bottlecap name. This group has a lot to offer one who's looking for variety. They start ""Long,Long Time Coming"" out with a slow tempo, but during the duration of the song it starts to ""POP"" out lyrics that become unforgetable! The UK lead vocals MARK has a soothing voice that would make any young lady ""woa."" He's backed up with a kick-bum band with Lawrence(bass) whose height DOES NOT EFFECT HIS PERFORMANCE BY FAR, Danny(drums), Lizzy (lizzard, electric), Richie(keyboards, back-up). Where Universal found these fellows is by far a mystery. Instead of tormenting yourself with another terrible album by ""Backstreet Boys"" or ""N'Sync"" Give this album a go. Trust me you won't be disappointed. Aside from their music these fellows are a pure pleasure to be around. We were honored to have met them in Ohio at a Def Leppard concert and their manners were unbelieveable! I do wish these fellows all my love and best of wishes..BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!"
4,I liked it better 12 years ago.,"This movie was awesome when I first saw it, but I was 13. I recently bought this movie for my younger brother because he's into the skating thing and there aren't many movies like this being made. As I was watching I noticed the acting to be very mediocre but the plot was pretty solid.The best thing about this movie is the skateboarding celebrities doing a little acting. Tony Hawk being one of them. There's a lot of ""old school"" skate tricks going on and just looking at the huge boards they used shows how much stuff has evolved.Overall I think this will appeal to the younger teen audience. If you're interested in that genre though, this is a must have classic."
1,No value,"Look at the song ""Dirty Little Secret.""The theme is pathetic. It's about being unfaithful and having a secret lover. Is this something to appreciate? It's disguistingly pop and happy, and what poor and heartless matter it talks about. Would you want to be in a relationship with this guy? Would you want to be that person that he has having the affair with? Hardly sexy, attractive, or inspiring music. It's not clever, the lyrics don't have any sense of sound or style, and it's completely trashy."
3,All american rejects-move along,The Cd plays great but the case was broken when I got it. There arent to many scratches on the cd but I'm glad that i bought it.
3,THE NAME FITS,"I heard the single and really liked it. I downloaded the album and guess what? It's the same bland boring crap that all these boy band posers are putting out. THANK GOD for TOM PETTY, THE WHO, STEVE MILLER.... are all releasing records this summer."
2,WARNING!,"Before you buy this CD - be aware that there is copy protection on it and you can't load the songs onto your computer or your iPod. Why should I pay full price for music that I can't listen to wherever I wan't to? Well I won't... I returned it. To bad too, because it's a good album. Four stars for the music, zero stars for the copy protection."
3,Move Along,"I didn't buy this one for me, but as a Christmas gift. I know that the person who received it, really enjoyed the gift. I saw one of their songs performed on TV, the one on the threadmills and thought it was great."
1,this band is as punk rock as a punk dress. stay away at all costs,"its been said so many times on here that this is just a boyband posing (VERY BADLY) as a punk rock band that everyone knows that by now and lets face it it HAS to be just a matter of time before not just kids but everyone stops listen to this junk cause everyone knows that all of this sugury sweet pop crap isnt cool and is just going to go away it cant last and soon listen to it will just make you the most uncool person in the world and i agree the sex pistols are punk rock in its most raw, hardcore form and if anyone wants to know what real punk rock sounds like they should listen to the sex pistols album -Never Mind the Bollocks Here's the Sex Pistols- or listen to any sex pistols album for that matter and if they arent willing to listen to give that a try or if they just handle that then they should just except that they are just part of the pop crowd and leave the punk rock to people gives it the respect it deserves"
4,Yeah.. Its Pretty Good,"Although it may sound stupid, I usually listen to music while I'm pretty busy at work, Thinking and concentrating on other things. If what I'm listening too grabs my attention and pulls me from my work I know that its a good one. While some albums just become background noise to me, this one stood out, I couldn't help but take notice of this one, tap my feet and enjoy what is a happy emo-filled power pop record. How long I can listen to it without getting bored? I don't know yet, 3 months and counting so far. I'm still not sick of there debut, I like it, I like their catchy sound. I don't believe these guys are trying to be anything they are not as some may speculate, don't over do it, no need to be harsh... its not hard.. Like it for what it is, or don't. I thought it was great."
3,where's the energy???,"Dirty Little Secret is a good song, and it has the energy and up-beat feeling of the old CD, but a lot of the other ones are slowed down, similar sounding, and whiny. I like voice of the lead singer much better when he's singing faster stuff. They sound more like Simple Plan and Good Charlotte who have unfortunately, taken emo to the absolute extreme, I don't even know what you would call it. They're not there yet, but I'm scared for them. Maybe I'm exaggerating, it's not a bad CD, I was just surprised by the change."
5,All you can ask of a mystery.,"This is the fifteenth of Ian Rankin's mystery book featuring John Rebus and Siobhan Clarke. As with all of his excellent stories, there are murders all over the streets of Edinburgh. They are, of course, all inter-related but how. I'm not going to tell the story. That's what the book is all about.A good mystery has to have something else going for it besides a good mystery. This book has two things:One is the developing characters of the two heros. They are getting along, and developing as they go. Times are tough, but they'll grow to get through.Second is the background story of the growth in England of the ""people of colour"" through immigration. This is a much darker story of life in the underside of our world."
3,A gritty thriller with messages throughout,Fleshmarket Alley is a gritty thriller with plenty of messages about the plight of immigrant workers. First in a housing complex an immigrant is murdered. Soon two skeletons are discovered underground in an old bar. Another murder is committed. The seemingly unrelated events are tightly related after all. Inspector Rebus shows more of his personal side and his connection to his family's immigrant roots. A decent read though a bit on the preachy side for me.
2,A betrayal,"I'm halfway through this book and like other readers, will probably give it up as soon as I find another book to read. I feel betrayed by an author who lures you into spending your money buying his book and your time reading it and then proceeds to batter you over the head with a political agenda. Never mind that I realize most of his points are valid; he could have gotten them across more effectively by just allowing the situations to speak for themselves. If an author feels he must espouse a cause, please let him do it subtly or, even more honestly, express his views in non-fiction. We get such a ceaseless diet of this type of thing every day from the media that some of us would like to just enjoy a good mystery, especially from an author we had trusted to deliver one."
3,Great book for young hunters!,"I had mixed emotions about this book. Personally I'm not a hunter, but i do have friends, and family that hunt. They say its very exciting.Because i have never hunted i thought this book had a whole lot of hunting in it, without a real meaning.It is hard for me to get hooked to a book.This book did get me hooked for a while but then after just reading about hunting day after day and the struggles it got a little boring.I'm pretty positive that hunters would like to see some struggles that other kids had with hunting.So like i said earlier i wouldnt really recommend this as a book just to read, but if you're a young hunter this would be an interesting book to read."
2,Microphone volume too low and can't be set,"Short answer: The microphone volume on this is set too low relative to the speaker volume, and cannot be adjusted independently--either through the device or at the O/S level.I spoke with tech support, and they said this was to keep the echo-cancellation software from having issues.So as a speakerphone, this device is useless.I'd have given it one star, but the rest of the device is actually very well designed, easy to setup, and so on."
4,Mellower than most but still awesome!,I can't understand people bagging this album. True it is generally slower than their earlier offerings but it is great music.Fatal shore is moody and probably one of my favorite Fixx tracks. If you are a Fixx fan and OK with slower music this is a great album.
2,below average at best!,"Mike seems like he is screaming ""Remember me, the guy from White Lion"" on this CD. A few songs reminded me of ""When the Children Cry"". For the most part this CD lacks original ideas!!"
3,"Not what I excpected, but not bad.","For fans of White Lion and Freak of Nature (Mike Tramps previous bands) you will be a little surprised. This album does not have the heavy guitar or fast passed style his previous bands had. Mike has decided to make a new identity for himself. He tries to sound like Bruce Springsteen (not that there is anything wrong with the BOSS) but it does not really work for Mike. Give me Mike's voice with Vito Bratta's guitar work and superior solos to this stuff. My opinion is to buy it if you are a big fan, but don't be expecting much. And prey that White Lion gets back together. ROCK N ROAR!!!"
5,Very moving with a Southern Rock flavor,"My wife and I recently saw Mike Tramp in concert and immediately went out and bought his CD. His music is touching--especially the piece ""Have You Ever."" His lyrics are poetic. And up and coming artist for sure. Enjoy! Jim and Bobbie Jo Staudenmeier"
3,Works,"This works, gets the job done in most cases. My main complaint is the clamp that locks the angle of the belt in relation to the tool seems to always slip when pressure is applied while sanding. May have to fabricate a modification to solve this issue."
5,Best in the box,"Well worth the price . We have been using this litter for years. With three cats, there is rarely a hint of there presence..."
2,Defective packaging,"For some reason my local Petco store has not stocked this particular variety of Ever Clean cat litter. So once again, I had to resort to ordering my cat litter from Amazon.I've ordered two 25-pound boxes of the extra strength unscented liter. Both boxes arrived with the opening pried open and leaking litter.The first box was delivered inside the UPS shipping box and leaked litter all over my walkway.When the second box was delivered, the driver had apparently removed the shipping box and taped up the opening in the Ever Clean box.As for the litter itself, there wasn't much lost and the litter works well, but something is going on in the delivery system. Someone is tampering with the boxes and this is very annoying."
4,Eye-opening expose,"Especially enlightening for the Italian-American who wondered where the crazy ideas came from. This helped to make sense of the feelings of inferiority and fatalism surrounding the new family who was so despised by the older newcomers from other countries and better financial status. Not especially well-written and choppy and repetitive, but it still held my interest and my heart."
1,horrible - poor quality,"Bought these to be able to put tomato plants out early (live in the mountains). Filled the ""wall of waters"" yesterday. Today, two of the three units have ""failed.""The seams between individual cells have failed allowing water to merge and bulge. Have to remove them from the tomatoes before they collapse and ruin the plants. This stinks! Now I either need to dig up the tomatoes and put them back into the greenhouse or find buckets/boxes to put over them at night.Awful quality problem. Wish I could give it NO STARS!"
4,Make a change in your life,"A friend introduced me to zydeco music, and Buckwheat a few months ago. Till then I was into classic rock. From then on, Buckwheat, and zydeco have taken over. Everytime I listen to him, a smile comes to my face, and I want to do some two stepping. What a feeling."
4,Montana,"I love most of Debbie Macomber's stories. This one had more suspense than most of her books, it had a surprise ending."
2,a fast paced reading book,"this book was a fast easy reading book and it isn't my favorite type book. I like more story line. A think Debbie Mccomber wrote well in her fashion, but this was not one of her better stories. That is the only book of the few I bought, that I have read, it has been a busy time for me."
3,Nimbe with Numbers,"I was looking for a math workbook for review over the summer for my rising 3rd grader who has some trouble with math. This was a teacher recommendation but I was disappointed with its content. I felt the book was overpriced for what it offered. There were very few worksheets to let your child practice basic exercises. Most of the book contained ideas on games and required pulling together various pages out of the book along with items from around your home. This book is very much concept oriented, not practice oriented."
4,A Very Pleasant Surprise,"When I ordered this book I had no idea of the reading experience I was about to enjoy. This was a comic made for adults; it actually had a plot which was not only interesting, it had a flow to it which made for a ""must read"". The utilization of Catman as a central character was brilliant; like many of the villians the reader is shocked to see how capable an opponent he is. Without explaining any ""powers"" he might have, the writers were able to convey a sense of competence and gravity to his character that frankly is lacking in most DC major heroes. The whole idea of the ""Six"" was perfect as well, and each of the characters were interesting, with the possible exception of the Parademon; I think we've just seen to many parademons used as fodder over the years to take this one to seriously. All the others fit in well however, and it will be interesting to see how they evolve from this story arc into the rest of the DC universe."
3,Great stuff but leaves wanting,"This 1996 release was almost overlooked by this fan becuase of its deceptive title, which suggests yet another ""greatest hits"" complilation. In a way, it almost is. Raffery has 8 new tracks, all excellent; but the rest of the album contains either covers or re-makes of his pre-solo work. The re-makes are well done, (""Right or Wrong"" even has a new bridge) but the sheer number of them makes it sound like padding. All the tracks are great--but a few more originals would have brought this one all the way home."
4,2/3 of it is a classic.,"Edith Grove's self-titled album opens with three very strong cuts and ends with another three good ones. The three in the middle, however, well--they're just filler.For Gene Loves Jezebel fans this is a must-have. At times some of the songs seem as they were lifted from a late 80's GLJ recording session---especially ""Under Your Spell"" and River's Edge."" At other times, songs such as ""Steel Away"" veer pleasantly close to early 70's ""glam."" In fact, ""Wheel"" features a chorus that bears close melodic resemblance to David Bowie/Mott the Hoople's ""All the Young Dudes."" One of the ""filler"" cuts, the tedious ""Cat Black Wizard's Hat,"" makes obvious references to the late T. Rex frontman, Marc Bolan.The album closes with an odd folksy/jangly/sing along number that would seem right at home with Dylan's ""Basement Tapes.""Overall, this is a rather decent musical adventure. Personally, I have my CD programmed to play only tracks 1-3,7, and 8 so this is more like an EP to me."
1,didnt laugh once,"i think maybe i saw the preview for this on another platinum series dvd and it looked funny so i bought it because i wasnt real familiar with alex thomas i had just seen him on a couple shows, but it wasnt funny not at all. it couldnt end soon enough at first i was thinking it would get funny then i just wanted to take it out not funny, shoulda rented it and not bought it"
1,A Disappointment,"I've seen quite a few comedy specials over the years and this has got to rank up there with Jerry Seinfeld as one of the worse. The DVD cover compared this special to Eddie Murphy's Delirious and Chris Rock's Bigger and Blacker. You gotta be kidding me. This comes no where close. I think I chuckled once. I really wanted to like it, but it just wasn't funny.The mark of a great comedian is that s/he talks about what people can relate to. Alex Thomas talks about random things that few can relate to and at times even contradicts himself. He talks about how much he hates all the cussin' in today's raps, yet his comedy is filled with F and N words. Not that there's anything wrong with that...it just wasn't funny. Bottomline, don't waste your time or money with this one. Even the cameo by Tyra Banks couldn't save this DVD."
2,Alex Thomas,The DVD wasn't what I expected! Wasn't funny and took short... I will never purchased a Alex Thomas DVD again... This should be taken out of your selections...
3,Memphis Died,"Movie couldve been better. Was missing Key rappers from Memphis. No Playa Fly, No interview with Ex 3 6 members"
5,A great story of adventure!,"This book is about Princess Torina, whose father (King Kareed of Archeld) defeated the peaceful land of Bellandra, home of the fabled powerful Sword of Bellandra. When he returns from his conquest, Torina's father brings a crystal in which Torina can see things that will happen (she realizes she is a Seer), and he also brings the son of Bellandra's defeated king to be a slave for Torina. However, Torina frees Landen immediately and becomes his friend. Then, trouble starts. King Kareed's right-hand man stirs up trouble because of his hunger for the Sword and power, bringing harm to the royal family and threatening the kingdom of Archeld. Landon, accused of having caused the trouble, flees. Torina and Landen must join together to save the kingdom of Archeld and rid it of this evil man (I don't want to give away who it is). I definitely recommend buying this book, because it is full of adventure and it has some romance too."
5,The best keeps it coming!!!,"Will Downing is fabulous!! This CD, like all the others, is smooth. I bought it the day it was released and played it over and over again. If you haven't purchased a Will Downing CD, you can start with this one. After listening, I am certain you will want more Will. His wonderful voice is displayed from the beginning to the end of this CD. Listening to this CD is as wonderful as seeing him live."
5,Will Downing is my Millennium Man of the Year...,"I just purchased Will's 8th CD and once again he surprised my senses with a refreshing, sensational mix of rhythmic moods and jazz blends with splashes of upbeat R&B. The sounds are new, yet distinct, set against Will's domineering and sexy vocals. Just the right combination! The most distinct piece on this CD is Grandma's Hands, which has a funky ol'school beat and puts a smile on my face and a tap in my feet. This CD is a must-have to add to your Will Downing collection, however, it differs a lot from the melancholic beats of Moods and his other mid-90's collection. It's obvious that he has branched out and worked with different artists. Thanks Will for making my Summer (Songs) 2000!"
5,The best of the bunch,"This is my favorite HL tie-in novel. The TV characters are true to form, the story is compelling, the flashback is intriguing, and the love scenes are hot!I love the parallelism between the current story and the flashback. What's the difference between a true believer - a zealot, and a terrorist? Who decides? When does patriotism turn into something else? How do you balance the passion of belief with the pragmatism of politics? How do you balance your fervent passion about something against someone else's for the exact opposite thing?Maral was an intriguing character. I liked her. I wanted to know more about her, and more about what happened to her later.The flashback to Masada was written so well...it was one of the most vibrant and alive parts of the book for me. I could *see* it in my mind. And the WW2 flashback was very moving. The rabbi and the tunnel linger in my mind.This is one of the HL books that I had to read more than once, I enjoyed it so much."
1,this book left alot to be desired.,"i like a book that goes back in time. everytime she bumped her head, she switched centuries. it got really annoying because everytime it got interested, she switched centuries!! i really didn't like it."
2,What a Swizz,"If you have already got the Stacey Phillips collection of American Fiddle tunes, Vol 2, then there is no point in buying this as every single tune in it is in that book too. There is no indication of this in the advertising so its all a bit of a con!The book itself is quite good, interesting tunes, reasonable lay out though a lay flat format would be better."
1,No Dre. or Snoop type tunes on this CD;don't buy this CD.,This CD contains none of the sounds I was used to hearing from Snoop or Dre. because they are't performing on this CD. In buying this CD I got screwed.
2,Way outdated and the author is too physical on the dogs,Here is another book that was written too many years ago and needs to be updated.The rapid training pretty much come from breaking your dogs spirit to get him to do what you want. Bird dog discipline is a must but this guys techniques are poor in general and will not make it fun for the dog. He makes the dog more of a tool than a hunting companion. Thumbs down
4,Oldie but a Goodie,"I had this book before, loaned it out and it went missing.I just got a Brittany pup, again, and wanted a refresher. It's a very good common sense approach to training although it is an early treatise.Still worth a spot on the shelf as reference. Teaches good manners in an easily understood way."
5,KINA:FINALLY OUT FRONT,"SINCE KINA WENT ON HER OWN, WE HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH HER HARD EDGE STYLE AND USE OF WORDS THAT MAKE THIS WOMAN A TRUE POET IN A CLASS OF HER OWN. I OWN HER CD. I FIRST BOUGHT HER SINGLE ON ""GIRL FROM THE GUTTER"". KINA HITS YOU WHERE YOU WILL FEEL IT MOST, RIGHT IN THE HEART. THAT IS IF YOU HAVE A HEART, AND IF YOU DON'T LET KINA TEACH YOU WHERE IT COMES FROM. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND BUYING THIS CD OR CASSETTE AND I CAN PROMISE THAT YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED."
4,The best of three worlds,"Imagine the soul of Lauryn Hill, the angst of Alanis Morrisette, and the rock egde of Tina Turner all wrapped up in one explosive singer- well then you have the latest dynamite artist to hit the scene. Her name? Simply Kina. The Detroit-native's voice is a welcome addition to what has become a scene dominated by bubble gum pop and trailer trash rap. From the ripping ""Girl from the Gutter"" to the catchy love yourself ""Me"" to the heartful ""Have a Cry"", Kina should be a front runner for New Artist at next year's Grammys. Every song on this debut CD exemplifies Kina's wide range of song style and lyrical prowress. MTV did the right thing making her video for ""Girl from the Gutter"" buzzworthy (the first time I heard the song), because the buzz surrounding Kina has just started and should continue to build to well-deserved peak of popularity."
4,A Sista on the Rise,"Kina may give you Tina Turnerisms on first listen, but don't get it twisted---she is her own woman and she makes it clear on this well done debut. I was struck by the power of her voice when I saw her on a local cable show and I knew I had see what this sista was about. Unfortunately, Kina will more likely get about as much love from the Black community as Macy Grey or Meshell N'degeochello. She will probably suffer from classic pigeonholing,despite the fact that she can't be pigeonholed in any one genre. In spite of all of this, Kina has announced her arrival and I think you should check her out."
3,SOLID DEBUT,"Although she isnt that great of a vocalist she can hold her notes. And I give her some stars for breaking away from the r&b standard to do rock/pop. Her music is good and I can relate to the story of being an underdog in the song ""Girl from the Gutter"" Although I am worried she may fade if not given enough airplay and video time. (It seems the radio stations only have time to play the same popular formula pop songs over and over and a few non traditional artists) I hope that she can break the molds and make people listen to her. Although, I have a feeling that she has the potential to be a sleeper hit like Macy Gray."
2,Very Average,I Guess With Macy Gray Blowing Up The Powers that be saw fit to find Another one.Kina sounded Good with Brownstone.on this Disc you hear Traces of Alanis Moressette&a Little bit of Tina Turner.but Overall she is Factory Product.She Ain't Anni Defranco.more closer to Billy Meyers.Girl From The Gutter is just a 2nd Tier You Outta Know.I give Her Credit for her Vocals in parts but overall the same old old.
2,bad bad music a review from kevin f,this ia a peice of c... i hate all the songs i cant belive i heard this cd its sucks
5,Don't Fence Her In,"This cd truly transcends all the boundries in todays music. Kina is'nt afraid of being original. As a former member of the group Brownstone Kina stepped away from that sound and has really let her own true self be heard on this cd. She's got the vocal power of Tina Turner and Chaka. It's a shame the public has'nt ever completely gotten to know Kina's music. I guess a black woman who can rock is just not on todays menu, but for all of us fans she is the daily special. (Smile)Too many talented people are so overlooked in todays music industry and I'm sick of it. When will it end. Come on industry people we're not all 10-15 year olds who idolize former disney channel kids....Ooh and also the hidden track at the end of the cd is one of the most haunting and powerful songs I have heard in such a long time. Kina's got it!!!!!"
5,"Read it, you won't be disappointed!","The concepts in this book are Biblical, but very new to me. I have struggled with the simplicity of the Christian message taught by many people and churches that encourage one to just admit they are a sinner and believe in Christ and you will be saved. In fact, I often ranted about what happens next? Now that I have my ""golden ticket"", what am I supposed to do with the rest of my life? Many times people focus on not sinning and doing good deeds. If you are a Christian, but struggle with the hypocrisy of your own life, then this book might help you. The message is one of real hope and true joy. It addresses who you have become and the relationship with God available to you because of Jesus through the Holy Spirit. How we think of ourselves has a huge impact on how we actually live our lives. This book is a big help for understanding what God has to say about who we are. The Author explains these concepts in just the way I needed to hear them."
2,"Birthright: Christian, do you know who you are ?","The promise regarding this book was so good that I was in a hurry to read it. But I have been disappointed. I found it difficult to read (and not only because I am French and it was in English) and, well, not interesting."
3,Too thin,I found these to have thin quilted sides and very thin cardboard. I have other brands for only slightly more money that have a lot more padding. Also the zippers are too short (don't go completely around the plates) so it is hard to get the plates in and out.
5,Available at The Great Indoors,"Best price at $140, had to special order it. It looks absolutely gorgeous in the store. Can't wait to see it in my living room."
5,Will catch a Man,I am a Black Man from the Chicago area. I read A.C. book and found it to be very informative and funny. As a Man if those tactics were used on me they would work without any problems. Loved the book.
4,Haunting novel,"The voices in this novel may haunt you. And if you're like me, you'll never ever forget the wackiest ever recipe for Jell-O. Somehow, Erdrich manages to convey a soft heart for hardscrabble realities of her characters."
5,Review,"Want to find the source of problems we all are struggling with in this society? This is the answer, where might we find the solution?"
2,"KINAS VOICE IS NOT IN THE GUTTER, BUT THIS SONG IS.","Kina's first US single ""Girl From the Gutter"" is receiving airplay and video play.However this song, which shows that Kina is angry at somebody, shows definite likeness to Dionne Farris ""one hit"" - I Know.The song is okay, has a good rhythm, but doesn't showcase Kina's beautiful voice.I haven't heard the CD yet, but I think this song ""Girl From the Gutter"" which sounds like she is a Ex-hooker, gone stockbroker will not grasp audiences.The hook and sound is average, but the title itself is confusing, and not attractive.I will be surprised if this song cracks the Top 40, and for Kina's talent I hope the rest of the CD is better and she doesn't end up a possible 1 hit wonder, which I doubt it with this song."
4,Good not Great,"I really enjoyed the story of the lead-up to the Republican primary and convention. The book begins with two disconnected stories that later come together, which contributed to its fourth star from me.I thought the stereotyping of the the conservative, religious-right leader was a little silly, but it definitely contributed to the story.I would recommend The Elect if you enjoy political fiction."
3,Bias evident,"The book was just ok for me. I love political themed books but this author had a definite bias against conservative politicians and the so-called ""Christian Right"". His portrayal of the Christian right leader was basic and typical coming from today's liberal mindset. Loved the plot, loved the story, but the character development was predictable and basic."
3,Not what I thought....,"This CD was somewhat disappointing as the recordings of the early years of Carmen Miranda do not do her justice as her voice is not the same as recordings of later years, or maybe it was just the recordings of the time. I always enjoyed listening to, and watching her in films as she was a very unique entertainer with a style all her own and which will never be repeated. The South American rhythms are basically the same with each song but Carmen adds her own touch of singing and therefore brings to life otherwise chronicaled music. I really liked her later recordings as found on the CD, ""The Lady In The Tutti Frutti Hat."""
5,Excellent study of the violent spread of Islam,"Many previous detailed reviews. This is an excellent book that analyzes the structure, spread and affect Islam has had on the world, how it has treated non-muslims, and shows its many flawed and deceiving faces. Islam needs to be understood for what it is by head-in-the-sand westerners and, besides analysis and understanding, western civilization certainly needs to identify a lasting cure for this violent, self-absorbed, hate-filled, psychotic plague before more demage is done."
1,Keyspan TVI-200C TuneView,"Great idea, poor implementation.- manufactuing problems (front-back part did not fit, popped out repeatedly, up button disfunctional (could not move up lists, only down)- software problems (with certain key combinations incomplete list display of iPod, requires reset)- cusotmer support: repeat emails, no response, difficult, to get life people on phone"
4,"Love it, but it keeps stopping randomly.",We love the remote. But it is expensive and it keeps breaking. We are on our third remote. The battery compartment needs some extra TLC. Everyone on staff loves the ease of use though.
5,Wicked Good Fun,"Botched isn't your conventional slasher flick. You can tell the cast all had a great time while filming. Campy and quirky nothing is as it seems. Botched will have you grossed out one moment but in stitches the next. This film is definitely a good time to be had by all(horror buffs). Grab the popcorn, plant yourself in front of your television and get ready to be wildly entertained!"
3,"A little itchy, but used it a couple of time and a big hit","I used it as a old biker dude for a Halloween party and my friends loved it. I then used it for my wizard costume and it worked really well. For Christmas I was able to pull off a solid Santa Claus. The only issue was that you can't eat from it nor drink, so you have to use straws."
4,decent cheap wig,Bought this for my 11 year old daughter because she likes making videos with her friends. She has had a blast with it.
5,Get your workout clothes on.....,"As Bishop contiunes to bless and build up the body of Christ around the world through this book! It has become another book that is a ""must have"" for every believer!"
3,eh,it stopped working in less than a year with moderate usage. I had to buy a new one and that one works much better
2,DOUBLE REMOTE CONTROLLER POWER PACK,I RECEIVED THE PRODUCT VERY QUICKLY BUT I ONLY RECEIVED 1 POWER PACK AND THERE WAS SUPPOSED TO BE 2.
1,Kessinger Edition ruins the rhythm,"I am teaching Jacob's Room this semester and wanted to provide a reasonably priced edition. Unfortunately, the Kessinger edition has formatted the entire novel as if it were being read off a computer screen, with block unindented paragraphs, each one set off by a skipped line. Woolf's novel is told in fragments --there are eleven in chapter 1, for instance-- but this rhythm is entirely lost in this edition. I regret buying it for my class, and recommend that people buy some other edition of the book.Of course I find this frustrating. Jacob's Room is a beautiful book, deliberately plotless with a protagonist whom the (omniscient!) narrator never gets to know. Go get some other edition and enjoy this delicate, rhythmical book."
5,Jessie Stone: Benefit of the Doubt,Another great Jessie Stone episode. Hopefully they will sporadically continue to be made regardless of authorship. It is always interesting to ponder the moral issues raised.
5,JESSE STONE: BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT.,"THE TOM SELLICK SERIES OF JESSE STONE MOVIE IS GREAT. IT'S ON CBS, BUT A TIME THAT I'M UNABLE TO WATCH THEM THE FIRST TIME, SO HAVING THE DISC ALLOWS ME TO WATCH IT AGAIN AND AGAIN. VERY GOOD."
4,Jesse stone,"Have all the DVDs for Jesse stone, their recommended viewing. Perfect casting, Tom is Jesse and think of him while reading the other books."
3,It's OK,"It's OK, but not on a par with previous Jesse Stone offerings. As has been said before in reviews, after the Parker story lines ran out the quality has lagged somewhat."
5,Love Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone!!,Love Tom Selleck as Jesse Stone!!I have every one of these movies and hope there will be more of them since Robert B. Parker has passed away.
2,Benefit of the Doubt,"I hate to say it....but the Jesse Stone series has seen it's better days. While the cast is strong, and likeable, the script for the newest production is simply a re-hash of the past.....""I'm very fond of you Jesse""; ""What are you looking at""; ""Nice to see you Jesse Stone""; on and on and on. If the creator of Jesse Stone, Robert Parker, was alive, he'd probably be the biggest critic."
4,A Welcome Addition to the Series,"Classic Robert B. Parker, Jesse Stone is partially vindicated but remains the bundle of internal conflicts we have come to know and love."
2,disapointment from jesse stone,"i love the jesse stone movies, i've watched them all this one feels like a 2-part movie it leaves you hanging a little bitbut maybe there will be another"
5,Great ! Cant wait for another one!!,We love all the Jesse Stone movies...Hope he continues making more! He is so laid back and the dog really tops it off. Hope he always has a dog.
3,"The least of the ""Jesse Stone"" movies.","The movie was slow, too many facial/backround music scenes interfered with the pace. Too many repetitions of lines such as, ""I never said that."" The twists were more confusing in their direction and some were left unresolved. While this may be good for a planned sequel, they just didn't provoke my interest in following the story past this presentation. I'm a Tom Selleck/Jesse Stone fan, and I was disappointed in this effort."
4,Love Jesse Stone,"My parents started watching these as they were released on TV and I caught up with the story on DVD. I'm a bif fan of Sellek's, ever since his early days."
2,Too dumbed down,"I do not enjoy giving a book low ratings, but I cannot recommend this book. However I will acknowledge some of you may find it a good read and I urge you to try it if you have reason to think so.Descriptions and explanations appear to be designed to include readers who have NO math knowledge. The author actually apologizes when he mentions that gravity decreases with the inverse square of distance.In my opinion, the time-gravity examples that are more difficult and less interesting ideas than the more famous examples that are usually covered. I think the author felt these example required too much math understanding which he was avoiding, but I strongly disagree.The author seems to think ANY math is too much. But he does not set the stage by explaining the elementary ideas of velocity, acceleration, or Newton's laws.There are much more compelling (and enjoyable) treatments available than this one."
5,um lets think hwere to start the author is cool.,the book is cool you should buy this book cause its only 10 dollars and it's worth it
2,Not so great,"I am a 14-year-old student and we had to read this book for a school project. I can't say that I really enjoyed it, but it wasn't terrible...The problem with 'Regina' is that the story inches along without any real purpose or definite plot. At the start, we are thrown into some fast-paced blood and gore and action, but then the action fades away and what are we left with...?Boredom.In theory, this is a great story. A young girl stolen from her white family and forced to live among the Native Americans!!! She struggles to find her identity amoungst these 'savage' people. It is an incredible story...IN THEORY.But it isn't written all that well, and the characters are not all that memorable or endearing (especially the main character).I wouldn't recommend this book (at all)."
1,A horrible book,"This book was disturbing. It featured many themes that are completely unnecessary, including an attempted rape, drunkenness, and a few morbid scenes of death and despair. The book isn't really intresting and failed pathetically as a story. I had to attempt to read it several times because I simply wasn't intrested. I had to read it for a school project, which was the only reason I read it. Now, I crave books. It borders on an obsession, but this book was so awful that it made me mad.It fails to intrest older readers, but has too many adult themes to be suitable for anyone under the age of twelve. If this rating system had a zero, I would've given it one. DON'T BUY THIS BOOK IF YOU VALUE YOUR SANITY!!!!!"
1,It's the wrong CD in the cover.,"The CD I ordered was not what I received. The CD I received was from the same singer but not the songs on the cover. I was very dissapointe. However, I only spent $6 so it wasn't worth returning.I will never order used CD's again."
1,Missing items,Received the Wine Goblets today but it is missing the contents cards that separate each glass. Without the contents cards I am unable to use this item and it is useless.
3,It works well.,"It work well for the price, but is not great. It protected my wine glass during a recent move. Would probably buy again."
5,Easy Read and Informative,"This was a fairly easy book to read. It was more of a personal account of what life was like for Fermi and his family. Not too technical, but still enjoyable."
4,Creative and Original,"I found this cd to be very entertaining, and musically sound. Overall, I would recommend this cd to anyone who is tired of the same old sound."
3,Random Choice,The selection of material on this DVD doesn't make any sense ! Other than the fact that both Bobby Hutcherson and Flora Purim (plus Airto) played at the same location there is no musical reason to put the two together on a DVD. This material is historical and important to own for anybody who likes these musicians. However it is appalling how the original shows have been butchered here. At least the Hutcherson fans get a good bite. But Flora Purim fans get a short teaser and than it is done. Only one song is given to us out of a significant show that was performed in 1980. The entire show (about 60min) used to be available on VHS under the title 'Harvest Jazz'. Why not releasing the show in its entirety on DVD ? One song is still better than nothing. So if you are desperate enough buy it.
2,Is this a John Grisham story?,"Tacky adaptation of John Grisham's book lacks not only the original story but also a real plot to go with it. Not only are the motives of some of the characters not even explained but also some of the tactics used in this movie makes no sense what so ever, and the whole gun issue is so out of place here that its ridiculous. I agree with everyone that the acting is the only thing that makes this film bearable with the great acting turns by Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman, John Cusack and Dustin Hoffman. See it for their performances, other than that, don't bother."
2,Flat.....,"Other than the good acting of Rachel Weisz and Gene Hackman (which both deserve a lot of credit for making the movie bearable) The movie is just a mess from beginning to end. The plot which is an taken of the John Grisham novel of the same name lacks the story of that novel and the showmanship and puts in a story about guns that does not even fit the structure of the court proceeding that follow. Dustin Hoffman is fine for the time he's on but after a while he disappears and the direction that follows the other actors don't even do them any sense of justice because the camera work flashes way too fast from one scene to the next. The story is called Runaway Jury but we don't really have time to really know the jury at all because we are stuck with what happing outside the courtroom other than what is happing in the courtroom. The movie excels because of the acting of Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman but I suggest you rent other movies from them instead."
2,Not very faithful to the book at all.,"Decent courtroom spectacle that is not faithful to the John Grisham book and makes a mockery of a serious subject. If it was grounded in reality, it would have been ok but it would rather play the good guys and bad guys' routine other than to face the problem of guns head on in a realistic way. The acting is the movie's only selling point with Rachel Weisz, Gene Hackman and Dustin Hoffman giving superb performances that the film did not deserve and John Cusack doing a fairy decent job as well. It's an ok film but it could have been much better if they just been faithful to the book."
1,terrible movie,"I'm glad I did not waste the money to buy this! I rented it tonight, liked most of the actors...but it fell way short early in the movie. The acting was pretty good, but the story is stupid and unrealistic and it makes you hate the actors (shoot the messenger, so to speak). Why not sue hammer manufacturers, afterall, people are killed with hammers all the time..how about bathtub manufacturers for making them so deep you could drown? It all seems to be about the big, evil, terrible, conglomerate corporation (who just happens to employ hundreds or thousands of people). Why do these directors/writers/actors or whoever have to get political?---it is spoiling the movies for me at a dramatic rate!"
1,Don't Bother,The only thing this movie was missing was a Simon LeGree mustache and top hat for Gene Hackman. It was a thinly veiled attempt to promote somebody's political agenda. It's a shame the story wasn't worthy of the cast. Don't blame me if you waste your time on this one.
2,Hackman and Weisz saves an other wise tasteless exercise.,"Stuff, condescending legal blunder takes all the fun out of the original novel and makes a mockery of it by trying to blame the gun industry for most of the violence done in our country. The acting is noteworthy, with Gene Hackman, and Rachel Weisz giving class to an other wise tasteless exercise in liberal morality.Avoid at all cost."
2,Runaway Jury,"I am from Mississippi and a huge John Grisham fan, but this movie/book is a huge disappointment. It is the sad epitomy of Mississippi jurys making poor poor decicesions. Don't take my word for it, MS was ranked poorest in jury decisions in the lawyers nationwide journal. Runaway Jury goes on to make the gun companies the enemy in the current violence of America. The movie incorrectly portrays the gun companies as evil businesses that enable criminals to buy guns. The only people in a legitimate business that can even be entertained as enabling criminals to obtain guns are the actual gun dealers. While I strongly disagree with the point of view expressed in this movie, it is actually somewhat entertaining, althoughh very Hollywoodized. Watch the movie, just don't take it to heart."
2,two hours of liberal indoctrination,"okay evil corporations, victimization, entitlement, and class warfare. I felt for a time that the Democratic National Commitee put this movie out. I think the only thing missing was President Bush busting through the courtroom doors in a Nazi uniform. I humorously enjoyed the stereotypical character types of the gun dealers and ""overly"" done wealthy gun business owners. Just substitute oil, fast food, Wal-Mart or tobacco for any sequel. These same characters will do well. Two stars are given relectantly for star power and decent acting."
4,good book and movie,this book was amazing. even though i am only in 6th grade i am a very advanced reader and loved the book. the movie was just as good. it seems that although the plot was about the same the movie did a better job of making it overly dramatic. it's hollywood though so what should we expect?
4,an acceptable diversion,.the pseudo.professional movie critics that berate this film for its lack of plot are off the mark..this is quality flick and more than capable of serving as a two.hour diversion. you won't finish the movie and immediately call friends.n.family to recommend the movie to them. but you will tell your co.workers or friends that they should check it out should the what's.a.good.movie.topic come up..this isn't genius film.making. it's a diversion. it does it well. it's a solid pop.corn flick.
1,Pro-gun control propaganda masquerading as a movie,"Could the pro-gun control agenda of this movie had been a little more subtle? I mean, everything from the evil gun company CEO to the portrayal of every 2nd Amendment supporter as a white trash, backwoods idiot with a mullet...I just couldn't tell what political agenda this movie was trying to advance. Even with all the cheap anti-gun emotional appeals, I still didn't catch on. I think I'll go out and do all kinds of stupid things, because after watching this movie, I no longer have any concept of personal responsibility. I can always find someone or something to blame for my own stupidity...Hollywood says I can!!Geez. Worst Grisham movie ever."
1,Just plain awful,"The ""plot"" just doesn't work or make any sense. Never mind that the political overtones are just ridiculous preaching rather than an an attempt at anything logical. Cusack says the jury ""voted with their hearts."" The only thing obvious from this movie is that neither the actors, the writers, the directors, nor the jurors were using their brains."
4,nothing beats the real thing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I bought one of those imitation brands controller and it was not the same it was not accurate and the life span was short i decided to spend alittle more and get the real thing,i have no regrets,it maybe simple but its definitely the best out tnhere......................."
3,"great voice, bad material,","As always, Tony does not disappoint with his vocal competence. His head tones and belting prowess sound better than ever. The selection of songs, however, leave much to be desired. We look forward to better material that will do justice to his voice."
1,Hardcore Higgins fans should avoid this like the plague,"I'm a big Dillon fan, so when I saw this I had to watch it. Unfortunately, I was sorely disappointed. Many details in the story, including Dillon's looks, (He's white blonde with hard, clear eyes, not dark haired! And he's short, too!) the heroine's character, and the eventual outcome were completely ignored. And I'm sorry, but that submarine looked really crappy. This is one of my favorite Higgins books, and I can't believe they slaughtered it."
1,Would not play - defective - not Region 1?,DVD would not play in any DVD player. It was either defective or not for Region 1 as advertised.This was the first time in my experience with Amazon (9 years) that I have ever had to return anything. The return process was very easy and the refund prompt.
5,One of the best,This is one of the best CD's in my collection of almost 500 jazz albums. I will probably wear it out
4,Jazz fusion that you can listen or dance too.,"This is one of those undiscovered gems that you come across once in a while that easily falls into your most played category. This is jazz fusion that is eminently danceable ( take the opening track ""free fall"" forinstance); but has many other elements like the soothing, sensuous vocals of Judy LaRose on tracks like ""heaven in your eyes"". The album is good mix of foot tapping up tempo grooves offset by beautiful midtempo melodies. My one rejoinder to the producers of this album(CD) is that I am getting really upset at the lack of any notes with CD,s. Who infact plays that kicking sax on most of the tracks?????GOOD ON YOU PEOPLE AT ""Nu GROOVE RECORDS"""
3,Great reference,I use this book as a reference guide. It is important for anyone involved in ministry to be able to help the hurting. This book gives great insight for specific situations. i recommend having it handy to prepare oneself for counseling.
1,Slow -Boring,"Maybe I wasn't in the mood to start this book, but I tried and tried to get into it. Just couldn't."
3,Good Reference If You're New to Networking,"It's a good reference if you're new to networking, or perhaps if you'd prefer a clear & layman explanation (with the help of diagrams) of the various network jargons. It feels pretty much like browsing through a 'Network' story book 'cept its targeted for the adults . There isnt much material (in fact, hardly) if you want to depend this book soley for the CCNA exams...you'll probably do way much better with the other CCNA study guides.Hence, get this guide if its your 1st foray to the world of networking."
2,Do not get for preparation of exam,"If you are going for you CCNA and have no idea about networking, get this book. But only to give you a BASIC understanding of networking. The book has nothing to do with the objectives and what it takes to pass the CCNA, and from the title, most people would would buy this book. It is very easy reading, but if you want to get straight to the point of what the CCNA covers, I would go elsewhere. Somewhere maybe like Todd Lammle. Best of luck with your studies."
5,"Stunning concept, magnificently executed","Not often is a project as ambitious as this such a resounding success. Engages your undivided attention, sparks your imagination, charges your emotions, and stuns your senses. Not to be missed - your grandchildren will be listening to performances of this opus."
5,The Best of the Best,"Terry Bisson, Ray Bradbury, Paul di Filippo, Harlan Ellison, Esther Friesner, Elizabeth Hand, Tanith Lee, Ursula K. Le Guin, Robert Reed, Bruce Holland Rogers, Bruce Sterling, Kate Wilhelm, and Gene Wolf are all writers whose name alone would qualify at least serious consideration for buying an anthology. This has them all. F&SF has long been a testiment to the greatness of speculative fiction and these stories are the essence of what the editors strive for: unrealistic stories of the highest literary caliber. Give this book to any one who loves SF, for that matter give this to anyone who hates SF and see if they don't love these stories."
2,Zzzzz...,"""Vespers"" are the last prayers before retiring for the night, and this album will certainly put you to sleep."
2,"Fine scanner, Very poor device driver","I got the scanner from Amazon on sale! It took me about an hour to get it to work with Win XP (Installed the so-called XP certified updated driver from Visioneer web site). Still every time I start the PC, the driver works on a randomly fashion!Apparently, this problem is very common and their customer support receives a lot of complaints about their drivers.If you have WIN XP and you dont mind re-installing the driver every once a while, it might be a good scanner for you. The scanning quality is just fine."
2,Has not worked so far,"I'm not sure if I need to use this for longer, but so far (1.5 weeks) into using this product I have not seen an improvement in my cats bowel movements. He still has extremely stinky poo and it is still more runny than normal. I will keep trying it for another week or so and then get something else. If anyone has any suggestions, let me know!Thank you,"
5,GREAT BOOK TO OVERCOME JEALOUSY IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP,"Before reading this book, I did not realize I had a problem with my jealous tendencies toward my wife. I thought her loss of feelings for me was due to some external factor. However, this book helped me realize that it is my insecurity that produced these feelings of jealousy and it was only natural for my wife's feelings to change toward me as a result. Mr. Hauck does not pull any punches in telling the jealous person that it is not their partner's fault, the fault lies with themselves. I don't know if I can save my current marriage but I know that the advice I obtained from this book will help me in future relationships. Whenever I start having feelings of insecurity in any relationship I'll be sure to pull this book out to reread. I only wish I had this book 6 months ago before my relationship with my wife changed."
5,Bob Bondurant on Police and Pursuit Driving,"Excellent Quality, Timely Receipt, Excellent Price. Will definitely use again and recommend to associates.Dr. John N. Parrigin, CPP, CFE"
1,Disappointing and very slow going,"A psychological study, rather than a whodunit, this book was on my ""most wanted"" list for years due to its reputation. Finally acquiring a copy via an auction, I read it with growing dismay and alarm. It's 230 pages of tedium for a mystery fan, climaxed by 2 pages of suspenseful action. Not recommended if you're looking for a mystery from the Golden Age of Christie, Carr, Rawson, et al."
4,Corny and great!,"Deliriously schmaltzy latin dance music recorded in England after the war. This will be a very pleasant surprise for folks who are mostly familiar with Ros' endless series of tepid EZ listening albums of the '50s and '60s... What we hear on this disc are perky, sprightly novelty tunes galore, with plenty of overwrought, corny vocals by Ros and crooner Ronaldo Mazar. The sound quality is very bright, although some of the source tapes seem to have aged around the margins: slight phasing problems creep in on some tracks, mostly noticable on the flute and woodwinds. Otherwise, this is pretty fab."
4,SPIMES = Wired,"In `Shaping Things' Sterling shifts gears from fiction writer to activist. This concise book was written to inspire designers to visualize radical scenarios connecting information technology and sustainability. Sterling suggests new connections between the virtual world and the physical world that will have you rethinking many of your assumptions about how we relate to products. If you design artifacts, machines, gizmos or products, then read this book!SPIMES = Wired.Post-Industrial = Tired.Industrial = Expired."
3,Not exactly what I was expecting,"I read and enjoyed Mr. Sterling's ""The Hacker Crackdown"" many years ago, and on the strength of that I bought ""Shaping Things"". I admit to being a little disappointed in the difference in style between that book and this one. But that's my problem.""Shaping Things"" is much more useful for designers, or for people who think about design a great deal. It's smart and engaging, but I'm not sure how much use or interest it will be to people who aren't interested in ""spimes""."
1,Who said this is 90s' masterpiece?,"This was really disappointing. 70s' Brand X had played quite good jazz but here, I couldn't know what they wanted to do. All three musicians playings were not mixed at all. Everything sounded too sharp, especially, the drum...yeah, too strong, too distinctive...in conclusion, I traded this."
1,boring,This was a technically accurate performance but boring. It failed to move me. I have many recordings of Chopin music and this CD needed to add something to the repertoire. It did not.I had high expectations of Yundi because I understand he won a competition. These expectations were not met and I regret buying this CD.
3,It was ok...,"I enjoyed this outfit, but I'm tall so it wasn't ideal for my height. I'm abt 5'10. I had to cut the feet out at the seams to mke it look like leggings, it was cute, but its for a someone shorter than 5'10"
2,too short...,"Let me start out by saying every product I have purchased from this seller has been perfect with the exception of this item. The package details say body stocking fits most. Now by most it says between 5'0-5'10 and between like 110-175lbs. Now my wife is 5'2 and 115lbs. The overall body stocking wasnt made with enough lace to stretch comfortably around her body and she could barely get the thing on. It has nothing to do with the leg position, but more along the lines of the torso/mid section of the body stocking being so short. And by that I mean the seam that should line under the breasts ended up lining the navel. Very displeased and I would send it back and get a new one, but its not worth the time or the shipping costs."
2,Pleasant Little Story,"I purchased this little book based on the advertising and preview - an impulse purchase.It was a quick read. I would consider it best suited for young adult (ages 10 - 13)readers (I'm several decades beyond young adult!). The ""message"" is all aboutstruggle against the odds, self esteem, self awareness, life's lessons andthe positive outcome - but told through the narrative of a horse growing up - that's Dandelion.Again, young readers might enjoy the ""message"" from Dandelion's perspective."
5,This book is a must!,This book is an excellent way to introduce the LOA to your kids. It's a sweet story for any age -young and old- and reinforces the idea that we do have the ability to change our circumstances at any given moment. I enjoyed the story so much and feel the message is so important that I have given the book to my daughter's teacher. I am hoping it will become a message that she agrees is vital to share with everyone.
2,A bit disappointing,"I usually love games and especially mystery games like the particular one. Unfortunately, I found it rather boring and tiring."
5,Nice chrome piece,"I bought this for my 2010 Camry LE and it fits and looks perfect! Very easy and quick to install. Just wipe down the area with alcohol pad to get all dirt and grim off and use the dry pads to clean and dry the area, take the red backing off the tape and apply it over the rear handle/tailgate area. Make sure it sits properly for the keyhole and press down firm and hold for a minute to ensure tape to bond on the surface area! Highly recommend this product!"
3,Okay for the price,"Not really for fat Mamas. I was being cheap when I got this. I'll admit that. I didn't want to put out the money for a doppler so I got this. You're able to hear the baby's heartbeat but, if you are a fat mama like me, you'll have to wait until about 24 weeks and listen really well. I actually got the doppler anyway.The product is really well made and shipped very quickly though. Overall, decent purchase."
1,Amazon.com.uk have a much better option...,"The Human Body is a good theme, but this one is ""no-so-good"" approach (very rare, because NGS make very good videos). The better documentary I ever seen about it, is the Dr. Winston's The Human Body, from BBC. Only available from Amazon.com.uk (please American Amazon's friends, what do you are waiting). I recommend to wait.....believe in me !."
1,Fellowes PS-60 Shredder,This shredder does a great job and is efficient and quiet for just about anything you would want to shred. I recommend it.
2,Poor photo printing,"I have owned Canon products for years. I have bought 5 DSLR cameras (sold 2 after about a year) and found them to be excellent. Now I know that this is an inexpensive consumer color printer but the photo quality is just poor. There is no nice way to put it. The skin tones appear washed out, in fact, all colors appear to be washed out. I'm using Canon paper and I've calibrated my monitor. I guess you get what you pay for but I really expected higher quality from Canon. Color documents are fine."
5,Great printer,"This printer is impressive. Good color density, contrast, brightness, and balance. Make a print on good glossy photo paper, and you'll think it came from a film camera. Plus it is fast and fairly quiet. It seems easy on ink- I printed several full-sized color-dense pages, and the ink levels have not dropped very much. This is the first color printer I have ever owned (and that covers a lot of printers) that is a pleasure to use.It also comes with a CD/DVD printer, which is disabled for the US market. See http://pixma.web1000.com/IP4200/ for instructions on re-enabling it.Hopefully it will hold up over the long haul!"
1,POS For MAC Users,"C'mon - Give me a break here.How in the world can Canon put out a device and not allow it to be shared via the network ?This device CANNOT be networked to with the MAC. The only alternative is a $69.00 printer drive software package from GERMANY!And here we are - six months after first reported to Canon - and still no updated drivers.This pure stupidity on Canon's behalf simply overwhelms any positive attributes the printer might, and ideed does, have."
5,Great Printer,Very good color printing. I am surprised to get such good quality for such a small price. It prints much better than my other more expensive one. I would highly recommend this product.
4,"Not Great, But Good","This product is good, not great, but good. The majority of the pictures come out sharp and clear. A few come out blurry and with lines."
2,Does not network...,"The best print quality I have seen - but it does not work reliably when networked through the USB on my wireless hub. Canon support simply said to plug it into the computer USB - which is not an option when all I have is laptops that are mobile. They could not suggest one that works networked.I returned it and bought a networked HP with slightly poorer image quality, more expensive ink, and poor Mac OS support/documentation - but it works!"
2,Warning - this printer will not work with Mac Classic or OS 9,"I had to return this printer because Canon does not support it (or any of the other new x2000 Pixma printers) with print drivers that will work under Classic. This may not matter for many people, but I hate MS Office, and still use Word 5.1a as my main word processor!Text printing using OS X was decent, but noticeably less sharp on plain paper than my 5-year old Lexmark Z42 -- there is significantly more bleeding. This could be improved by choosing 'grey scale' and reducing intensity to about -20. It could be improved further by choosing the maximum 'Fine' setting, but this caused an extraordinary increase in print time. Text printing could probably also be improved by experimenting with other plain papers or using 'high resolution' paper.I did not print any photos, so can't comment on photo quality."
3,"Average novel, but does have some cultural value.","Elechi Amadi's ""Concubine"" is the story of a lovely and kind woman whose husband was taken away from her very suddenly. A young man in the village then finds himself becoming hopelessly and fatallly drawn to her. The otherworldly menace doesn't make itself known until the last 50 pages or so, and then it becomes a question of fate. Nothing really new here, but it does show some cultural aspects of the Igbo."
2,The Montana Past: An Anthology,"The book that was advertised, and what I thought I was purchasing, was ""The Montana Past: An Anthology"" published in 1969. What I received was ""Montana's Past: Selected Essays"", which is the 1973 re-write of the original book. If I had wanted the 1973 version, I would have ordered the 1973 version. By the editors' own admission: ""In essence, the second edition is really a new book."" What was left out? What was changed? Needless to say I was disappointed at the misleading advertising of the book."
4,Girls with swords and a guy in a dress,Isthar takes duzzel to see her aunt and meets her very starnge prince cousins. Isthar goes all bad girl and helps her duzie wuzzie to find her great grand father. At one time there are two princess Isthars as duisse gains the power to shape shift. Is dares gay????. We find out family secerts can't wait to read book three.
4,Misleading title,"I bought this thinking I was getting a Sony memory card. Instead I got some aftermarket knockoff.Fortunately, it works on my PS2 and I haven't had any problems saving PS1 game data to it."
1,Have bought two of them and they both broke.,Bought two and they both broke. It was the cheap plastic dish. They crack for no reason and we barely used the soap dishes. Broke within weeks of having them.
2,Hokey Pokey,"I don't know whether to call this cutesy or juvenile, but it was definitely not informative. The ""slang"" was not historical, but the kind of stuff you hear on old westerns. Some real information on brands, cattle, and horses was interesting, but not very in-depth.Not a book for adults, but small children might be amused."
5,Heart Rending and Triumphant...,"...for anyone who grew up during the sixties and seventies this is a poignant look back that you won't want to miss. Don't look for flashes of pop idols, teenage fads, or media darlings... rather than the then world under the spotlight, ""Family Album"" is about you and me and all the other everyday people who were playing out the search for the typical ""American Dream"" during the years when it finally began to grow up. And while your mom may not have been a movie star or your dad a business tycoon you'll see them in Faye and Ward Thayer, and you'll see yourself as well... struggling to be one with yourself and one with your family...Don't miss out on Danielle Steele's ""Family Album""... it's a great flick! Great performances were delivered by Jackyln Smith, Michael Ontkean and then newcomer Joe Flanigan."
4,Magnificent Obsession by Lloyd C. Douglas,"I read the book many years ago and loved it then. Just re-reading it lately made me want to share it with a lady wanting to read good Christian literature. My only disappointment is with the COVER of the book offered now . . . I felt it was ""ugly"" and did not relate to the story or message of the book at all. PLEASE CHANGE IT .... a totally blank cover would be much more desirable!! Please DON'T JUDGE THIS BOOK BY IT'S COVER --- because it's powerful message can be life changing."
2,"Nice music, but where's George?","As the soundtrack to an IMAX film of the scaling of the world's tallest summit, this is a fine album, full of stirring themes, mystic teases, and some well-known tunes. The biggest flaw is that the cover advertises George Harrison's name in big letters, but it contains no actual music performed by George. Orchestral revamping of material like ""Here Comes The Sun"" is okay, but if you're looking for any new material from Mr. Harrison (such as SUNG by him), you're out of luck."
3,Good history but disappointing musical analysis,"This is an interesting book but it promises a good deal more than it delivers. It's an interesting history of the recording industry in Mexico, but we never really get a sense of what the ""counterculture"" in Mexico was and what music had to do with it. The history is rather anecdotal and musical analysis is superficial. The most interesting chapters are the early ones about the impact of the Elvis era on music in Mexico and how the record industry in Mexico responded to the British invasion."
1,Not varied like shown,I ordered this to try all the different types of drink and I was sent a lot of watermelon and strawberry and 1 hibiscus. The drinks also do not mix well and are clumpy.
4,Another good story,"Book three of the Rotten School series this one has Bernie Bridges trying his best to get a date with April-May June. But April-May is not interested in a boy who can't seem to keep out of trouble. So, Bernie tries his best to be a good student. That means he can't be involved in the slug race... or can he? Another story with better than average appeal to the pre-teen reader, The Good, the Bad and the Very Slimy is recommended."
3,It is a good dresser for a child's room.,"I bought this dresser for my two preschool age children. It is small and they can easily reach it to get things out of it. Though it is kind of flimsy, I noticed that it opens smoothly and doesn't come off the track with repeated openings and closings. I will probably have to buy a bigger and more sturdy dresser when they are older but for an inexpensive dresser, this one will give us several years of use. It was easy to assemble too, something my husband appreciated."
2,Hope Gilstrap regains form on next one,"I enjoyed Gilstrap's Nathan's Run and At All Costs, but Even Steven was a grind. The eternal internal monologues were drudgery. A lot of it was down right corny. It was hard for me to believe that an upper-middle-class, educated, married couple would act the way the protagonists did. Didn't seem real to me. April Simpson maybe, Bobby and his wife, no. Some reviewers said this book was gripping, and moved fast. The only place it moved fast was at the end. I hope Gilstrap rediscovers his storytelling ability in time for his next one."
3,Solid thriller,"Gilstrap is an average writer of average thrillers. This is no exception. Something to pass the time at the airport or on the train, but not much else."
1,Bad quality,"This movie is so poorly produced that most of the scenes are so dark and underlit that it is a chore just to watch the video. Also, the sound is so poorly recorded that there is crackling noise in the audio and the actor's voices are annoyingly loud and distorted at times, and yet also too soft and too far in the background in certain passages to understand what is being said."
2,Ketchup is a vegetable.,Description states that shredder has all steel gears which attracted my attention so I purchased one expecting what was advertised.Plastic gears cannot handle torque and break which happened to my old shredder.When new AG-10x arrived I noticed that mention of all steel gears was not on box so I began to smell a rat.I decided to remove back cover and take a look and you guessed it-there were plastic gears.The gears which take most of the stress are steel but about half of total number are plastic.Old shredder had gears which were part plastic and part metal so maybe they mean that gears are completly steel without any plastic.Plastic gears are completly plastic too but they did not brag about purity of their plastic gears.
2,Too loud and confusing,"""Obvious"" isn't of course aspiring to be a great single of Westlife and even the most ardent of the Irish group's fans would find it hard to keep a copy of this track in their shelf for too long. The song's okay for a few listenings but overall a long period of time,it would simply make us weary."
1,REALLY bad ZERO stars,"Someone left this book behind at a Mexican resort I stayed in. I can see why, it's horrible. The writing consisted of cliche phrases strung together into a meaningless boring story. I did not read out of interest, because the plot never did develop. It was a horrible fascination with the numerous usage and grammatical errors that kept me engaged for less than thirty minutes. It was like trying to look away from a tragic car wreck and not being able to do so. The college professor who taught our (required) writing class would have had a stroke if she read this book. I am rather glad she will be spared this torture."
2,Re-hash of old stuff,"How many times can you re-mix and sell old stuff. If you have many of the other titles on VHS, your kids may be bored with this countdown. Supposedly a top ten list, it includes silly songs that may not be your favorites and excludes some that you are sure should be on there. I would skip this one."
4,Veggie Tales - The Ultimate Silly Song Countdown DVD,"My friend had this on for her 3-year old and I just loved it! For kids, the songs are cute, catchy and fun, the veggies are silly and catch their attention. The humor is cute for adults, too. So, I don't have kids, but I bought it anyway. It is great to have around for a good laugh..."
5,This has been a favorite for years.,"The title of this DVD says it all. This is a compilation of some of the silliest Veggie Tales songs in one DVD.Includes some greats like:The Dance of the CucumbeThe Water Buffalo SongThe Song of the Cebú,The Pirates Who Don't Do Anythingother silly songsThere is no moral message in this DVD it is just silly sing-along fun."
1,A mere collection of papers : a shame for the publisher !,"Not only is the editing one of the poorest i've seen so far, but it is also just a compilation of papers that appeared elsewhere. Not the least additional insight compared to the original papers, a complete waste of time !"
5,Full Circle,"When a story hits home, then that's the making of great literature. The characters are in their prime of life, learning to cope as they grow olders. Mistakes are made, but can be overcome. Excellent reading."
4,My Kids Loved It!!,"My girls got this video for Easter and they loved it!! This veggie video contains all of what we've come to expect from the veggies, a great story line, with humor, songs, and a moral that kids can understand. The moral of this video: sharing helps you make friends! I was disappointed with Esther and King George and it was so good to see Bob, Larry and all of the Veggies back!! Great Job Big Idea!"
2,CHEAP - But Irene is Gorgeous,"Just like my summary says... this movie reeks of low budget and the poor acting that goes with it. But, if you just want to enjoy Irene Bedrad's beauty for an hour or so... why not... she's in it."
3,lots for your buck,there are a lot of movies here. it took me a couple of days to watch them all. many are awful some worth seeing. if you want a large collection of science fiction this one is not bad.
5,Do you recognize a spoof?,"Uh, duh. The other review of this fascinating book missed the point entirely. A brilliant paleontologist as well as an imaginative writer, Slaughter intended his last opus for fun, for those who have a background in fossils and those who have an interest in myths and fairy tales. No, there is no ""proof"" that any of these things existed. Slaughter put his extraordinary mind and a good illustrator together to produce one of the must delightful books on paleontology since Roy Chapman Andrews hooked generations of kids on T. rex. Don't seek this book out if you want proof of mermaids and dragons, fairies and UFO inhabitants from Peru; get it for joy and expansion of all your childhood fantasies, with willing suspension of disbelief."
4,"Very informative, full of surprises","If you've read the ""Little House"" books, you'll find that some things in the stories weren't quite the same in real life - for example, the Ingalls family's time spent in Burr Oak, Iowa, isn't mentioned in any of Laura's stories, nor the fact that they actually lived in the Big Woods twice in Laura's lifetime - the events of ""Little House on the Prairie"" actually took place when Laura was too young to remember, so of course she relied on her parents'memories of Indian Territory. Also of note are a couple of name changes - the ""Oleson"" family was actually the Owens family, and the quarrelsome people she stayed with on her first teaching job were named Bouchie, not Brewster. Many more surprises await you when you read the story, but I don't want to give everything away!"
5,"A Good, Book, I will Recommed","This story is about a girl, Laura Ingalls wilder's life. Her life was fall of hardenss but she didn't get scared and strived harder after she had her many losses. This strive had brought her from farm woman to a famous writer. This story told me if you don't give up and strive more, everything will be done.The reason I recommed this book is because it had told me a person's real life and it made me learn manythings that was helpful for my life. The main reason was that I like to read about biography books."
4,L.I.W. A Biography,"A very entertaining and accurate Bio. for young readers. This book is a great tool for young people who has had thier imagination's set on fire by the ""Little House Books"". Once I Read them, I could not get enough info. about that time in history. The photos were also excellent. Great read for kids who are fans of the series."
1,I saw this in a theater!!!,"I actually saw this at the Westview Theater in Maryland during Winter 1993. The film's original title was The Weekend It Lives. It was released to Maryland theaters since its director, Michael Mfume, was (and still is) the son of Maryland politician Kweisi Mfume, who would later become president of the NAACP. Thus when people make comments about this being shot on a 1980s' camcorder, they're probably correct.The theatrical experience was no better than the home video one - poor picture and sound, unprofessionalism on every technical level, and a feeling of, ""Oh my goodness, anyone can get a movie released."" The only intriguing part of the film was its title, and then they go and change that for the DVD release so people think they're going to see just another slasher flick. This film is an insult to slasher flicks.Of historical note only because of who directed it, Ax 'Em is as bad a film as you'll ever likely to see. For some that will make this must viewing."
1,Worst Movie Ever,"Well at first I thought this movie was going to be cool because I thought these kids were gonna kick butt!. But all these teens do is run around and scream like idiots(were they trying to be serious). The suicide scene were the man shoots himself and blood goes all over the wall looks like water and the only part I liked was when the dorky dude gets killed in the beginning. The beginning credits was the only BEST part, It taught me how to dance, HAHAHA"
1,Absolute garbage,"Wish I'd read the previous reviewer before I wasted money renting this dog. I'm in 200% agreement that this has to be the worst film ever made. I've watched thousands of films in my lifetime; rented hundreds; and never before have I yanked a rental out of the player before the opening credits were complete. And I've seen some real stinkers!If I had to guess, I'd say the plot was loosely outlined by teenagers, ad lib'ed by their best buds and shot using a single video tape recorder, using the built-in microphone on the camera. Then the whole thing was burned to a DVD to play from start to end when inserted like one would burn a CD. No DVD features at all.The printed statements used to introduce the plot are so grammatically incorrect as to be incomprehensible. I actually laughed out loud when I saw that the killer was going to ""revenge his family"". Please!!If I could give negative stars on this one, it would be minus 5."
1,You've got to be kidding me.,"I have no idea how such utterly archetypical pop-slush is getting such glowing reviews. Sorry to say, but this music is unoriginal. I would go so far as to say that if one of their songs were playing on the radio I would not be able to identify it as they don't have a trademark ANYTHING. The album doesn't deserve 1 star exactly, but I had to rate it so low to balance the profusion of undeserved fives."
5,Good overview of a unique culture,"Robert Pringle, former U.S. ambassador to Indonesia, provides a fair and balanced overview of the social and political history of Bali. Mention Bali and most people think Paradise. While the island's innate beauty and friendliness among its people cannot be denied, neither can its history of slavery up until the late 1800's, mass suicides in the face of Dutch invasions, nor the fratricide of the 1960's which resulted in the killing of 1000's - still not discussed to this day among the Balinese. This is a must read for anyone intersted in the real Bali."
5,DA BOMB!,This is the best CD in the world! It has the best music in the world. It makes you sing and dance.
4,o.k. c.d. but Who Let the Dog's Out has a groove.,"the c.d. could be better but the popular song ""Who Let The Dog's Out"" is great because of the beat and also rhe song i would say is excellent for dances."
1,Baha Men Stink!,"Who Let The Dogs Song is such an annoying song! I don't even understand why it is even being played on the radio? These guys have no talent whatsoever and should just quit already. The only reason that they are even singing is to try to win publicity from people and that is downright stupid! These ugly guys want fame and money, and thats all. You dogs suck! Do not buy this Cd!"
2,A big dissapointment!!,"Tormato is a Yes album filled with flaws, one need only to see the album cover. Simply the dumbest and most pointless of Yes' entire catalogue.The songs themselves.. most just don't measure up, to the best of their songs. Future Times/Rejoice is an exception..I think it's one of their best songs. Don't Kill The Whale is pretty good and one with nice enviromental theme to it. Onward is a rather nice ballad but is actually improved on in their Keys To Ascension live album set. Most of Rick Wakeman's keyboard sounds are annoying, Lyrics on the other songs flow poorly and create very stilted songs. The performances themselves are pretty good.This is a big step down from their previous album which is a masterpiece. After this one, Yes was in for some very big changes, some good, some not."
3,3 1/2,"This isnt the best Yes album to be released, and there is a world of difference in sound between this and the release before it ""Going for the One"" yet this is still a good effort. LIke most Progressive Rock bands of the time such as Floyd and Rush, once the early 1980's hit, those bands started to use more synthesizers and eletric drums, but YES was always seemed to be 10steps ahead of everyone else, and this is the album where we here ""Yes"" starting to use heavy synthesizers and more watered down songs. Yet this is still a good YES album, and there are are 2 tracks that really sparkle, but some of the album is a bit dull you can start to hear the direction that the band would take in the 1980's, which was to turn from a progressive rock band and start to get into the mix of pop rock. Its not a horrible thing, as some of the 1980's releases are still solid, but nothing will ever top the material they wrote in the early 70's. ENJOY"
2,"You Say Tormato, I Say Tomato...","After the triumph of ""GOING FOR THE ONE"", the only way to go was down. Now don't get me wrong, there ARE some very good moments on this album. But even the band members themselves have admitted this was a troubled project. Tormato is, curiously, one of the most dated-sounding Yes albums, with a slightly dry and flat production sound. Chris Squire tampers with his bass sound, with not always successful results. Rick Wakeman's keyboards though are dynamic and to the fore. One of the best tracks is the rather fun ""Arriving UFO"", on which Wakeman seems to be enjoying himself. Other highlights are the love ballad ""Onward"", an atypical Yes song, and the ecological rally cry of ""Don't Kill The Whale"", which was years ahead of its time. The writing was on the wall for Yes. Where could they go, and what could they do next? Tune in next review for some Drama..."
4,"Yes ""Tormato""",I liked this album way back when i owned it in vinyl. This album is just another side of Yes with some unique and memorable songs on it. Its a CD that will appeal to some and not others...
2,A very uneven album.,"This is one of the weaker albums that Yes has released. It has grown on me some, considering I thought it was absolute garbage when I first heard it. ""Don't Kill The Whale,"" ""Does It Ever Happen,"" and ""Arriving UFO"" are not bad songs. It's just that the band sounds like they are going thru the motions. It was also one of the last albums that Jon Anderson was on. Not as bad as ""Tales From Topographic Oceans"" but not even close to ""Fragile"" or ""Close To The Edge."""
2,One of the weaker Yes outings,"Which is to say, it's a fine record by anyone else's standards to be sure. Some great moments surface, and the song 'Onward' is a true classic. Overall, ""Tormato"" is largely an uninspired affair, due to Rick Wakeman's unusually drab performances and a shockingly cold and flat production. 'Arriving UFO' may well be a silly song, but it does manage to entertain in a strange way, and Chris Squire does some amazing bass work, especially on 'Circus Of Heaven'. It seems that Yes had pretty much run out of gas by the time ""Tormato"" appeared, and a change was in order. Worst of all is the cover art, a really unfortuanate choice for a Yes album. After so many great Roger Dean covers, this. If you're a true Yes fan then you will have to own this. To casual Yes listeners I'd say avoid ""Tormato"" and pick up ""Drama"" and ""Relayer"". Certainly not a bad album by any means, but it is among the four least important Yes efforts."
1,The cover art says it all,"One of the worst albums by a band that has released a ton of bad albums. If you listen to it, you'll want to add to its tomato splattered cover. The nadir of a group of dinosuars caught in the heart of the punk era."
2,All the remastering in the world can't fix this disaster,"Onward is great. Don't Kill The Whale is potentially good (the live version on Yesshows is better). The rest is sludge -- badly produced, and no ear for strong melody or progressive arrangements. The band's second worst album, after the horrific 'Union'."
5,Hail to the LISTENERS!,"I won't spend time sharing all of the titles of this record or the others. Suffice it to say, I agree with all of those reviewers who actually LISTENED. The songs tell a tale, the musicianship is incredible, whether you are a YES fan or not, and the diversity, humor, imagination and messages are all worth listening to more than once. You can actually visualize the story through the sounds and effects of the instruments. This has always been my favorite YES record, and without a doubt, deserving of better acclaim than it has received in the past."
4,YES throws a curve ball,"I love YES. This is no Going for the One or Close to the Edge, but it is still quite enjoyable.Agreed with Rick--the production could have been better. But even with lousy production, Yes still shines. Squire kicks ass with the harmonized Rickenbacker-- as a matter of fact, he owns Tormato with that signature sound. Anyone who plays bass, or appreciates fine bass playing, should own this. ""On the Silent Wings of Freedom"" will knock you out. Squire is all over the place, but KEEPS THE BEAT. How the hell does he do it?The harpsichord is ""Madrigal"" is beautiful, as is Jon's voice. I really enjoyed all of the tracks on this album...But if they could go back into the studio and do it over again with better production--watch out. There are moments of brilliance on Tormato.I love these guys, they were having fun on Tormato....And Squire gets all mushy with ""Onward."" Very sweet.Give it a go."
3,Good Bonus Tracks,"3 stars for the album - 5 for the remaster.It's nice to finally hear ""Picasso"". Jon sings a bit of it in the Yesyears video.And just a correction to another review. Jon didn't write ""Onward"". Chris did."
5,growing up,"Gowing up, in every known culture, has always been a painful experience. Often happy one, but sometimes not so happy. Many times charming, and many times heavy with burden you bacome aware only later in your life. Coetzee has stared with his own growing in backwater town near Johannesburg, picturing the life as it has been in the days when he could be called young lad. Showing his affection towards his mother which always seemed to him more 'paternal' than she should have been, Coetzee paints a portrait of an ordinary child in not so ordinary sourroundings.Qouestion is, can that be called literature. Of course it can, but it is somethig more than pure literature... it is life itself, pusling growing, crying, evolving... With every step of kiddie John you'll be aware of 'dangers' that lay ahead of him, for every wrong move he takes you'll feel sympathy... and besides other, that kind of thing composes the great literature"
3,I thought it was interesting,"I thought that the book was as interesting as anything can be when it is part of a college course. I did, however, feel that it skipped from character to character with little sense of flow. The book was geared more towards getting across all of the facts instead of being an easy read.I love baseball and this book but if you read it be prepared to spend quite a lot of time reading and understanding it."
4,enjoyed this book,"saw the movie years ago, when it was just a movie to me. Watched the movie again a few years back when I was more interested in baseball history, and really enjoyed it. I read the book and was able to gather more insight into the history of it. I watched the movie again shortly after I read the book, and was able to piece together a few more things.It's one of the most memorable (infamous) things in MLB history, and this tells it wonderfully."
1,It Does Not Get Much Worse Than This!,"Although the facts are somewhat basically correct, I strongly suspect that Asinof embellished the truth more than once to please his own sense of history on this subject. Historically speaking, the facts are out in the open and he needn't really have fictionalized them so much. Asinof must have been telling the same stories over and over through the years, with changes to sensationalize, and somehow this has become embedded into his mind as the absolute truth. Nothing could be further from his truth. This book, and the movie are a complete waste of time. Buying this book would do little more than feed creedence to this pack of mistruths. The eight deserved a much better fate than this. It does not get much worse than this. Anthony DeMedeiros, Toronto, Ontario"
5,best 4.5 inch borg,"The borg has three removable arms that can be a gun, a hand, or a borg fixing tool for the borg ship. Also a stand with the borg symbol on it. also two extra tubes for the borg to use"
1,Phone Charger,Didn't get the right thing. Got a car charger instead! Didn't want to take the time to send it back.
4,"Great package, shame they didn't continue the series","After recording this off cartoon network, it was great to get it on a properly recorded legitimate commercial DVD, without all the toonami adverts etc, and in better quality and widescreen. The packaging is visually pleasing and of good quality. I will definately collect all 3 volumes."
2,The Region 2 Version,"This isn't a bootleg... it's the Region 2 version (PAL), which seem to release some series before Region One (such as the Region 4 Smurf releases)This is volume # 4 in the region 2 release of the series. It's okay, but only has a limited number of episodes on the disc. Unless if you have a region free dvd player, this DVD will not work for you."
1,This DVD is a bootleg,"This is obviously a bootleg product, because this series is not officially available on DVD yet. Save your money for when the real version comes out and don't enrich someone who knows how to make a DVD burner work."
2,Other than Dre's this does not make it,"Dre means well with introducing new artists to the populace, but these ones try to hit it hard and not to present the wow to us...Dre does well with his songs."
1,3 out of 16 = 19%,"I bought this a long time ago thinking it was gonna be full of the usual heat Dr. Dre brings. I remember skimming through it thinking it was the worst purchase I ever made for an album. There is nothing but talentless no-name rappers and singers throughout and just forgettable tracks, one after another. There are only 3 songs out of 16 that are worth keeping and actually have replay value, I still enjoy them to this day. Of course it's because they sound like some effort was put into them by great rappers like KRS-One, Nas, King Tee and an actual song with Dr. Dre on it.KEEPERS:East Coast/West Coast KillasBeen There, Done ThatStr8 GoneThrow the rest in the garbage and press delete."
3,Alright,"It's alright, the majority of the CD seems to be RnB though, I didn't really even bother with it. The good, rap songs though are ... On The World, Blunt Time, and Been There, Done That."
2,"C'mon now, this can't be Dre!","I'm glad I didn't bougth this new, I bougth it used, and gave it away a couple of days later. Simply because the album hardly got any good songs, the only ones worth mention is the intro, eastcoast/westcoast killaz, been there done that and the mel-man track called shi---n on the world. And for does songs I wouldn't pay this much. Skip it, unless you're a TRUE Dr. Dre fan that buys everything he touches. I recommend either ""The Chronic"" or ""2001"" if you want Dre at his best."
2,some explanationw would help...,"I am thoroughly frustrated with this book. It would have sufficed to include just a few pages in the beginning, explaining the layout of the charts. Likewise, it would be nice to have a translation of the verbs on their actual conjugation pages. The only thing the editors chose to translate on the verb charts was ""Past, Present, and Future."" The abbreviations (e.g., ""intr"") are not elaborated upon anywhere. When you look up a verb in the index, it gives you what I'm assuming to be the root of the verb, yet there are certain Hebrew verbs that have 20 different English translations, and it is very unclear which one is which. It's frustrating to have to spend my time figuring out this book instead of investing it in studying the language..."
1,Does not absorb well...sits on top of skin like a film,"This moisturizer sits on top of my skin and doesn't seem to soak in or moisturize at all. I would use it on sunny days for the SPF but as soon as I would break a little sweat it would feel like there was a slime sitting on top of my face. I get self conscious because it feels like I have a visible film on my face from the moisturizer. It's an expensive product, and it is not worth the money I paid for it."
3,There Needs To Be A Real nWo Story DVD,"This video is pretty good but could have been much better if the wcw part of it didn't end in september 96, the best part of the nWo storyline took place in 97 and 98 was pretty good too, they need to come out with like a 3 disc set with the entire story and a lot of features, like all of the nWo promos from wcw, not to mention about 10 full matches from the nWo era, this video is pretty entertaining but every time i watch it feels like somewhat of a rip off to skip from sept. 96 to feb. 02."
3,3.8 stars....,"This definitely not a bad DVD. It takes you back to when the nWo first showed up on WCW, and how it went on. It could have talked more about how many people they ONCE had in it. BUT it mainly focused on Hogan, Nash, and Hall. Which are all good wrestlers but it could have covered the WHOLE nWo a little bit better, as in number of members wise. Other than that it was pretty interesting, plus you get a few bonus WCW pay-per-veiw matches that are not as easy to find since WCW went out of business."
2,"A bit inacurate, but an enjoyable DVD.","Well, I really enjoyed the beginning part of the DVD when they focus on the WCW-nWo war. I didn't get into wrestling until 1998, so it is nice to look back on what I missed. The DVD goes bad once the focus shifts to the WWF invasion of the nWo. They focus to much time on this, rather than devoting more to the WCW days. Plus, it just reminds me of how Vince really droped the ball on this angle. If you enjoy the nWo or want to reminice, you should rent the DVD. If not, don't even bother."
2,"Great product, lousy buying experience","1. Wrong item initially sent (cordless ordered, drill with cord sent); contacted seller who apologized & agreed to send correct item.2. When correct item received, it did not include stud finder originally included in purchase.3. When correct item was received, batteries for stud finder were bad, exploded & corrosion was all over inside of drill & case...along with human hair...DISGUSTING!!!4. Response time adequate, but I won't buy from this seller again, too many problems for what was supposed to be a Christmas gift."
2,"Zahn was alright, Martin is Martin","If you want to waste your money, watch this movie. By far the worst movie I've seen in a while. But seriously, I think he's been in ENOUGH COP MOVIES, and Hollywood should start looking for fresh faces and new material, because I could've sworn I've seen an identical plot on another movie. Whoever came up with this movie, or helped put it on the big screen, needs to be subsequently put in jail, and forced to watch what their toil and labor has produced...crap.As for Martin Lawrence, please tell me I'm not the only one who notices that he acts the same in every movie."
2,accumulation of information,"Next to Shalamov,Solzhenitsyn, and Ginzburg, Ms Applebaum's book is, for me, just an accumulation of information."
1,The author is neither impartial nor honest nor qualified.,The book is not so much about Stalinism but about Madame Applebaum's own obsession with Russia and her rabid Russophobia. Considering who the author is the book is rubbish.
5,glenda white anderson,"""Gulag"" reveals the terrible truth. To think that the USA and Britain worked hand-in-hand with Russia to finish off Hitler and that they knew nothing about the thousands of work camps where Russia, not only hid away their own citizens on an industrial-sized horror, so did they whisk away Poles, Hungarians et.al. after the west secretly conceded territories to Stalin in order that he could have more skilled, albeit free, labor.It is a stunning account. It changes the whole WW2 dialog. The few who escaped to Finland were not believed. Surely the horrors were not true.Applebaum's intelligent and sensitive writing is a marvel."
3,Just okay for me.,"I love Mike Dooley and have listened to his books over and over. This little book, though, is the least impressive of all he's done. It feels a bit fluffy."
3,Smart and Funny - but something's missing,"I loved how Melissa Nathan built up the characters and plot - there's plenty of witty and really smart comedy through out. I felt that the ending was remarkedly rushed considering she used over four hundred pages building up to a climax that just sort of fizzled. While some of the interactions between Katie and Dan were packed with sexual tension, there just didn't seem to be enough quantity to make the whole ending believable. I loved the book while I was reading it but was majorly disappointed in the end."
3,BEWARE OF FIRE!,"We got our Gene Coffee roaster at Xmas. Love the machine, and the coffee. Last week we were roasting beans (we put the roaster out on the patio because it sets off our smoke detectors every time we roast in the house!) While roasting a batch of beans the drum got stuck, it was almost done roasting the beans, so it was only maybe 5 minutes that the drum was stuck. When we went to pull the beans the roaster was extreemly hot, and melted the outside case of the roaster where the chafe comes out. The drum wouldn't turn so we took the machine apart and found it had melted the unit where the chafe comes out, the back case by the vent, the base where the screws go in, and the gears that turn the drum. Thank goodness we got to the roaster before it went up into flames...and the house too! Love the coffee, but the roaster is a fire hazard!"
4,Grace Slick with Linda is one great duo!!!!!,"Grace Slick has said lately, that she doesn't want to sing-publicly, and she can't sing softly. I bought this cd to hear the latest recording of Grace. No one will be disappointed with ""Knock Me Out."" Proves beyond a doubt that Grace is still in great vocal form. I had never heard of Linda before this cd was brought to my attention, but what a bonus! Linda demonstrates her musical and vocal depth/complexity throughout this cd. No simple ~ sugar music here! I'm waiting to hear more, Linda! and Grace too!!!"
3,A grab bag of wonders......,"Well first off note that this mondo style film never bored me. It had just enough action packed into the 105 minutes to keep me watching. If you took away the death scenes and just listened to the commentary, you would take alot out of exactly what the movie was trying to get across. Most people judge this film too harshly. I will warn you, if you are weak at heart do NOT WATCH THIS FILM, but anybody else who has a free night and wants to watch special effects at there near greatest, check this movie out. Although not 100% real, this is still worth watching. I think that a group of film students wanted to make a scary movie and didnt want to include a plot so they made this. All over, 3 out of 5."
2,This movie warped my fragile little mind!,"The guys at the video store let me rent this one when I was like 12 years old. I used to be into all that sicko horror stuff, so the box for FOD really interested me. ANYWAYS, the scumbags actually let me rent it, and let me tell you, by the end of the movie, I was totally disturbed about death and dying. A few weeks later, my grandfater passed away and it was really hard for me to deal with because I kept thinking about all the stuff I saw in Faces Of Death."
3,SICKLY ENGROSSING AND AN EYE OPENING MOVIE,"I saw this movie having read numerous reviws about it. Viewing it for the first time, i actually threw up but after realizing that most of the scenes are fake, I came to terms with it!"
2,video description,"If you're into really gross movies, this one is for you. This movie is extremely graphic and bloody. It's supposed to be real accounts of peoople in different situations getting murdered and it shows everything close up. I hope you don't have a queasy stomach."
5,yep!,This movie is great if you like to see people die. For those of you with a heart made of wax do not watch this film as it will burn your heart and melt it to the depths of you bowels. Watch as innocent people die!
5,great cd,One of my all time favorites. Listen to one headlight or 6th avenue heartache. Both great tracks.They have a new album out this month. Should be just as good or better
5,Reminds me of childhood,I used to listen to this tape with my mom on road trips as a kid and have such fond memories that I bought her the cd.
3,More for Borgeans than lovers of detective fiction,"As more of a Borgean rather than an admirer of Lovecraft or Poe, I enjoyed this but it failed to grab me. Definitely belongs to the realm of fantasy fulfillment, as a Brazilian translator heads out to Buenos Aires to solve a mystery with none other than the blind Argentinian master. As is to be expected, the yarn is more about literature and involves little more than two men sitting in a library swapping arch meta-references."
1,stupid,This is the worst of the king of the ring pay-per-veiws!!!'98-hell in a cell'99-the ladder match'00-table dumpster match'01-street fight'02-a 30 minute match between to red-necks spittin and slugginoverall it stinks...
5,Fast-paced and involving. Highly recommended.,"Parapsychology fans will relish the return of Cree Black, who becomes immersed in a case of spiritual possession which will test all her resources and draw them into a dangerous New Mexican desert confrontation. A talented Navajo student falls ill with violent seizures attributed to the spirit of a dead ancestor, involving Cree in a dangerous world of spreading possession which keeps Land Of Echoes fast-paced and involving. Highly recommended."
1,Keep Shopping,"I read the reviews here,and thought I had found the perfect headset. I liked it for about a day. It's uncomfortable, cheap feeling, the boom mic does not have enough angle adjustment for when you have the headset around you neck and multifunction button does not like to recognize that you want to mute the mic.After a week, I got frustrated enough with this thing and destroyed it. [...]Save your money, ignore the Logitch fanboys."
3,Grab Bag from the Chess Vaults,"Well, maybe not exactly SMOKIN', but these blues smolder a bit. B. B. King's leadoff track ""Into the Night"" is from the old John Landis movie of the same name and it's over-orchestrated Hollywood claptrap. The real highlights are Howlin' Wolf's ""300 Pounds of Joy,"" usually not anthologized; Muddy Waters' ""Love Weapon,"" and John Lee Hooker's ""Let's Go Out Tonight."" Little Walter's rendition of ""Key to the Highway"" sounds like it could have been the blueprint for Derek and the Dominos' version. And it's nice to hear Sonny Boy Williamson doing ""Have You Ever Been in Love"" just because it's nice to hear Sonny Boy Williamson. Toss in an Etta James gem for good measure and hey -- the whole thing's six bucks and change! Good value, but a bit short."
1,Here Comes a Rollercoaster,"If you love Kid Vision/Dave Hood videos, you will be disappointed with this one. My family owns 16 different Kid Vision/Dave Hood videos: ""There Goes a (Bull Dozer, Dump Truck, Fire Engine, Airplane, Train, Police Car, Mail Truck, etc.). They are generally both entertaining and educational. I expected the same from ""Here Comes a Roller Coaster"". Although my 5-year-old son found it entertaining, there was little educational value to this video. There was no discussion of how rides are designed, built, or maintained. It focused its entire attention on riding rides at Six Flags amusement parks. My son now says he loves Six Flags and wants to go there, which I think was the whole point of this particular video. ""Here Comes a Roller Coaster"" is, in my opinion, a 30-minute commercial for Six Flags."
1,Don't Buy,"This is not a great video at all. The only reason I bought it for my 3 year old is because he is so into rollercoasters right now. The heavy metal music in the background that only occasionally swithces to CLASSICAL is about to drive me bonkers, and I'm in the other room!!! It has a bad story line and to me encourages kids to get upset with their parents if they have to work instead of taking them to Six Flags. I've put this movie away."
4,Totally Overlooked -- Great Gothic Dance/Wave Album,"Reminiscent of early Xymox, this 1990 album contains a handful of really great tunes, along with a clunker or two and some instrumentals. You may have heard ""Gabrielle"" at a dance club in the early nineties -- it still pulses with an irresitibly energetic drive, with some deft electric guitar and haunting keyboard harmonies drifting through the background. Their follow-up album ""Dans L'Oiel De La Tempete"" (they were Canadian, I think, but all lyrics are in English) is solid from start to finish. Too bad they never got the run or industry support they deserved -- if I was a wealthy patron of the arts, I'd re-assemble these guys, give them top-quality instruments and a first-rate producer, and watch them go to work."
5,Tajin Fruit Seasoning,"I have been eating this on fruit since I was a child in mexico. I see some use it on many things, whatever trips your trigger, but in mexico it's a fruit seasoning.I love it on any fresh fruit, my favorate is oranges. If you are in a heavy mexican area where they sell fruit bowls it will have this on it. A great summertome snack (or other times)."
5,Tajin,This is a great product......very fresh........good taste. The company communicated well and I received the item very quickly. Thank you!
4,Jet Li comes to America and Kicks Master jonny's butt!!!,Jet Li stars in this crazy but funny movie. Li comes to America to find his master and runs into 3 latinos who try to steal his luggage. The master isn't Jet's best movie but for the hardcore Li fan it's a must have. The villian in this movie is an American whiteboy named Master Jonny who has a hockey player haircut and a mullet. Although in real life Master Jonny wouldn't stand a chance in Hell of winning a fight against Li The Master is a fun and entertaining movie;when cultures collide!!
2,"Bad Jet, Bad!!","I know this was one of Jet Li's earlier films based on the clothing, music, and hairstyles of the characters in the movie, and Jet Li looked much younger. Anyway I was quite disappointed, I am glad Jet's movies have gotten better because this one was........my mouth hung open through most of it. Asians complain about being stereotyped in other people's movies, but there were stereotypes about everyone in this movie and I know I am just rambling on but,,,,,my goodnes........It was pretty bad. I gave it just one extra start just because it was Jet!!!"
1,Tsui Hark at his worse,"I thought thet this movie was the WORST movie ever based on the talent that was involved. I don't think that Yuen Wah could have been any worse. Jet Li was pretty good, but how the hell do you screw that up. Tsui Hark seemingly didn't rush through this movie, but it still turns out horribley. I would like to go on to explain how the movie was so bad, but I'll just sum it up by saying that not a single part in this movie could have been any worse."
2,CAUTION - Disappointment likely,"This movie definitely does not meet any expectations. The acting is horrible, the plot is simplistic, the action leaves a lot to be desired. Not Jet's best work. I would consider this a D movie, let alone a C or B movie.Definitely check out any/all of the following: 1). Fist of Legend 2). My Father is a Hero (The Enforcer in USA) 3). Fong Sai Yuk 4). Once upon a time in China (all 4 of them) 5). Swordsman IISome of his other descent works: Hitman, The New Legend of Shaolin, High Risk, Black Mask,"
4,Jet Li In Action,This is a showcase of Jet Li's brand of martial arts...fast and furious. While this is no Fist Of Legend the movie has enough action to keep the exitement going. What I did'nt anticipate was the humor. Absolutely lots of laughs to pick up where the action stops. Once persons are prepared to judge this movie on it's own merit they will see that this movie was worth buying.
1,Not a book but a compendium,"In my opinion this is not a book but a compendium, compiledfrom very poor photo copies. Save yourself the money anddownload the free online version.The compendiums cover are some what more detailed in theirexplanation though."
3,Timing mismatch...,"Another reviewer mentioned that he noticed a timing mismatch between the audio and the video. I noticed too and was wondering if there was a problem with my copy, but now I see that is a general issue. Regarding the concert I was disappointed. I didn't like the fact that Sanz let the public sing and entire song (""Y ¿Si fuera ella?"").I mean, I pay to hear Alejandro Sanz, not 65,000 people singing along. Finally, at the end my favorite song (""Corazón Partio'"") is massacred by one of the notables that came along with him. I don't know her name neither I care, but I'm talking about the first one to sing after Alejandro at the beginning of the song.My recommendation if to stay away from this DVD. If you really want to try this, rent it or borrow it from a friend. If you can live with the timing mismatch, buy it."
2,Hay un error en la edición del DVD!,"No se puede ver, el video no concuerda con el audio, está un poco atrasado. Es molesto verlo asi!!!"
1,"Put this horse out to pasture, and out of my misery...","I grew up with Leon Russell, and have worn out every copy of Hank Wilson's Back I ever owned.Did someone drag this guy kicking, and screaming out of retirement, and into the studio?Do your wallet a favor, and listen to Hank Wilson's Back one more time, and forget this waste of money.Its sounds like he is sleep walking through the entire session, doing duets on songs that were never meant to be anything but solo.I don't take into consideration songs like ""He stopped loving her today"" because nobody could ever measure up to No show Jones on that one.Please leave this guy alone, and for heaven sakes don't let him sing anymore. At least not within range of a microphone.Hank Wilson doing ""Crazy"" was certainly nuts.It goes immediately back in the case, and should make a handsome coaster for my coffee cup.Nuf Sed."
1,The Hush 10 does NOT HUSH!,"I purchased this product for a 10 gal tank a friend gave me in order to upgrade from a 5 gal Hex system (that I absoutely love), so my fish would have more room. Right out of the box this thing drove me nuts. I went from an aquarium that I could see and not hear to one that I can hear all the way upstairs! It's worse when the lid is on. Not only that, but the intake valve is so short that when debris is ""sucked up"" toward it, the water flow pushes it right back down and away from the valve. It doesn't even reach half-way to the bottom of the tank when extended. I've already contacted the manufacturer since it's supposed to have a ""lifetime warranty."" I want my $ back & I am holding the people who designed this catastrophe responsible. DO NOT BUY this product."
5,A Forever Keeper,"I loved, loved, LOVED this story. Read it years ago, lost it in a move, found it again in the attic, and have since read it several times more. My favorite parts were the historical sections. This book is a Forever Keeper!"
1,Where is the rest of the series?,"I dislike in the extreme the release of only a small part of an old series. I enjoyed this series immensely when it was first aired, and again during the many phases of reruns. While I have most of the episodes on tape, I would like to purchase them on DVD. But the owners have decided to only release a subset of the episodes.For me, I will not purchase these until I can buy the complete set.Wouldn't it be great if my one voice could send a message to those who make the distribution decisions.And Amazon, you should allow a rating of zero stars."
2,Inferior product,"Soon after I put this frame on my truck, the black lettering just disappeared. Right now, all that's left showing in black is the 'G'. I expect that will vanish someday soon. Not worth the money I paid for it."
3,Cute Movie,"This was definatly a cute love story, that I enjoyed. It was humorous, yet elegant. I suggest it to any female."
3,A Sweet Movie,This is a sweet movie with all of the predictablity that goes into a romance like this. Rich handsome man falls in love with a woman that he thinks is rich and beautiful but in fact she is just the maid. Of course there is more to this movie then the main plot. Ms. Lopez's character learns that she can do anything she sets her mind to and more. This movie is both about strength of character as well as a feel good romance. Despite the cookie cutter effort this was still a nice way to pass a hot summer evening. Not oscar worthy but still worth watching.
2,A 2.5 really...,A 2.5 for the storyline. It was predictable but cute. I wouldnt buy it but I would watch it just to see what its like. Kinda boring because this story has been played so many times. But its alright.Overall: If your bored -watch it but just DON'T buy it (in my opinion anyway)
2,A horrible movie,"This is a horrible movie. Jennifer Lopez has always produced great comedies, like The Wedding Planner, but this one was a huge flop. When I first saw it, I didn't get the impression that the cast felt their characters. Jennifer Lopez and Ralph Fiennes don't play their roles convincingly enough. This is a horrible movie and I strongly discourage you see it."
1,TOTALLY PREDICTABLE,"This movie was totally predictable. I do not like Jennifer Lopaz and she proved, in this movie, that she really can not act. It was a total wast of time. Although it is kind of romantic, you will find yourself guessing the next parts of the movie, and they turn out to be right. Dont wast your time or your money on this horrible movie."
2,No extras? Please. I sense a second release...,"This is just a theory... but I predict that this movie will be released AGAIN in a few months -- that time, with extras.Yes, this is a nice, cute love story and worthy of owning if you watch chick flicks many times.BUT...There is absolutely NOTHING extra on this DVD.More and more the studios try to get us to fork over our money twice... first by the original DVD release... then months later with a ""Collectors Edition"".I guess we are supposed to love the movie enough to buy it twice.That ain't happ'nin.As I said, this is a cute chick-flick I would watch over and over... but I am going to wait for the extras that I bet are coming."
5,Great Movie,"I disagree with the bad reviews that this movie has gotten. Although this is a predictable ""Cinderella"" story, it's still a really good movie. I really enjoyed it. Tyler Garcia Posey was one of my favorites as Marisa's son Ty. He was so cute and funny. Jennifer Lopez as Marisa was very believable because the two of them are so much alike. I would recommend seeing this movie. It's not very deep, but it's still a great movie to watch. It's very sweet."
1,Absolutely Horrible,"I hated this terrible movie. There was no plot, no character development and why did Ralph Fiennes agree to act in such an atrocious motion picture? Surely he doesn't need the money. So much of PRETTY WOMAN has been unoriginally hackneyed; only this time it's a maid (in a 5 star hotel in Manhattan) who tries on a socialite's $5,000 outfit (from one of the rooms she cleans). She and her son then take a walk (with a future senator--Fiennes as Chris Marshall) to the zoo and the two adults fall madly in love with each other. I don't need to tell you what happens next although you can guess. Ironically, at the end there is a press conference aka NOTTINGHILL where the adorable Hugh Grant--I'm sorry, I mean the maid's son, questions Marshall about forgiving his mother. Even if you like the main characters (I'm actually a big fan of Fiennes) you will not like this film. Plain and simple, this movie stinks and I am warning you: Do not waste your time with this mindless drivel!"
4,A Surprisingly Charming Film.,"MAID IN MANHATTAN is a film with a heart. It had the energy and momentum of a gentle roller coaster that seemed fairly predictable but pleasantly performed. Ralph Fines (Red Dragon, The Avengers) gives a standout performance in this feature and he is extremely believable and very likable. Jennifer Lopez (Selena, The Wedding Planner, Antz) gives a sincere performance as well but makes Ralph look that much better.Another little shinning star in the film is Jennifer's son played by Tyler Posey (Collateral Damage, Doc) who really performs well and makes a real attempt at tugging at your heartstrings. He is funny and energetic.Directed by Wayne Wang (The Joy Luck Club, Smoke) the film takes an honest look at race, class, income status and the reality of people and their stereotypes of others. It has great funny bits and a real emotional ending too.This is a great positive film for the whole family. Everyone should enjoy this sweet chocolate center at the middle. (12-31-02)"
1,BLEH!,"Yuck! This movie is horrible. The plot is just so boring, and I think J. Lo should stick to singing and dancing (music videos). That's something she actually has a lot of talent in. She was good in The Wedding Planner, but she was not good in this movie. I think it would have been better if they had someone different play her part. DO NOT BUY THIS!! DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! If you really want to see it, go over to a friend's house and watch it with them if they own it, or go rent it and make someone else pay."
3,A christmas carol for the yule season,"Incredible fairy tale but after all why not. In this world of ours everything is possible even flying to the moon. And there we do fly to the moon, or are flown to the moon. And it works and is pleasant for two main reasons. First this maid who is playing Cinderella revisited is able to say a few nice truths to this biggy future would-be senator, like the fact that he would never have noticed her if she had been a plain maid. And also because her son is the sentimental, even sentimentalese naive argument that makes the sauce set, and set it does and set it will. So enjoy the fairy tale even if today's world is not that pleasant all the time, and New York City that clean and that safe. After all it is nothing but, and that's something indeed, a Christmas fairy tale, a Christmas carol of sort, the best fairy tales in the world.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris I Pantheon-Sorbonne"
2,2.5 Stars is more appropriate,"My wife wanted to see this because her 70+ grandmother thought it was the greatest movie since slice bread. So we had to watch it. It wasn't as bad as I thought is was going to be. The movie was very predictable. No surprise, but still kept my attention. Jennifer Lopez is in her element playing a working class mom, opposed to upper-class Italians (Wedding Planner) or ballroom teachers (Shall We Dance?). Ralph Feines added a touch of class to the movie. Natasha Richardson provided the only humor in the movie. The little kid was pretty good. For J.Lo fans, she looked amazing towards the end.All in all, nothing new or groundbreaking, but maybe it's a movieto watch when there's nothing else on."
1,Pure Torture...,"The acting is bad, very bad. The story is so dumb it makes my brain bleed. Sure, JLo has a big booty but does that mean she can act? I tolerated her wooden performance in The Cell, due to the special effects and the presence of real actors in the film; but she keeps making these horrible flicks!Let me put it this way: I'd rather watch Mariah Carey's ""Glitter"" than sit through this horrible JLo commercial again."
3,Cutesy,"It's the best word I can think of. It certainly is not an awful film, though it is definitely 'chick flick' and not for those who abhor chick flicks. J. Lo does a decent role as a single, hard-working mom who is trying to get a better position for herself. The romance feels somewhat cliched, but Bob Hoskins does a nice job in his role. overall allright movie."
1,This film needs ssome serious help.,"This film is not what was expected. Wait, I guess it should be expected that a singer gone actress film would have it's problems, but this film has some real problems! The plot is reminicent of Sleepless in Seattle where the kid is the one who makes the parent fall in love, and gets things going. It really is a cinderella film, one that has been made again and again since movies have been around because I know I've seen this film about 20 times before. The acting is OK, but I didn't see a good mesh between the characters. Everything seemed to happen ""the way it should"" in these chick flick sort of films. I just wouldn't waste my time watching it again, because it is unmoving and quite bland."
2,zero chemistry,"Primarily, I detected no chemistry between the main characters and just couldn't believe that any depth of feeling developed from their brief and uncomfortable meeting in the park. Certainly not enough to spiral into the farce that followed. Her nobility of purpose in first, not telling him the truth and second, running away from him, was so unlikely and insincere that it set my teeth on edge. The Cinderella storyline allowed the viewer to predict the ending, eliminating even the small pleasure of mystery and doubt. The child's personality and thought pattern was written as though he were a mature, asexual adult with cute playful child-like attributes to remind us that we were watching a child. The male lead was occasionally convincing with his piercing stare and undivided attention but absolutely unconvincing as the offended and decieved lover. I walked out of the theatre bored and undiverted by this film. Don't waste your money - wait for it to hit cable."
1,Comparatively speaking . . .,"Yes, yep, ok - there is quite a lot here in the way of anecdotal and downright gossipy juicy goodness. Lots of little-known facts about political and social figures and about the Flapper as her own peculiar demographic.However, the author's assertions that Reconstruction was a good thing and that the Volstead Act achieved what it set out to do both give rise to the inevitable suspicion that if he was wrong on both these counts (as he very clearly was), then the veracity of his work and indeed his believablily as an historian is in serious doubt."
5,Must read book on change in the 1920s,"Fascinating read about the changing mores of American society. Zeitz doesn't shrink away from presenting both the good and the bad, what was gained and its price. And any good drama has conflict of course. Information is presented as an integral part of human stories and so never suffers from the dry tone of many historical books. A must for anyone interested in American history and especially that of the Jazz Age!"
4,Good source of knowledge,"I read this book for a American History class I am taking.It was pretty interesting to me, a person who has always been interested in the American flappers of the 1920s and their scandalous ways. Zeitz follows compelling (and well known) flappers of the 1920s and shares their stories to the reader in a non bias way. However, I should warn you that I became awfully bored with a few of the people's life stories. However, this book is a good source of knowledge, and I feel like I really learned a lot!"
4,White House Ornaments!,This came fairly quickly and it was the perfect gift. I love getting them each year because they have history and have very cool designs.
2,Bad Movie,"The jabbering of Martin Lawrence and Will Smith is very annoying and seems out-sync with the worn-out protect-the-glamorous-witness formula. No serious acting expected here, but Téa Leoni is especially bad in her role as the witness."
2,Disappointing,"Movie was a disappointment. Bad Boys II much funnier, thought I would like to see original.Outdated humor, not worth my time"
3,It was Téa Leoni's movie...,"Looking at it from an acting point of view, the womenhad the hard straightman roles. Just a lot of killing, drugs and real bad guys with no shading. Black on bad in sin city USA.Special effects was blowing things up and car chases.A role reversal of a black cop with a family and his playboypartner, turns into a hostage situation when thewoman witness is kidnapped in the hotel lobby during a gun fight.So it ends like you expect..."
4,"ACTION!, ACTION!, ACTION! THIS IS AN ACTION MOVIE, NOT A COMEDY..","The chemistry between MARTIN LAWRENCE and WILL SMITH is the strength of this movie. Tea Leoni plays really well (and she looks GOOD) with these guys, too, in this buddy/cop/international drug dealer tale. I thought this was a comedy, but I was wrong. There is humor, yes. BUT, THIS A MAJOR BANG, BANG, SHOOT 'EM UP, BLAST 'EM OFF THE FACE OF THE EARTH, MASSIVE EXPLOSIONS, CAR CHASE MOVIE. Will Smith exposes his finely toned chest liberally. He looks great.I REALLY ENJOYED the special features commentary by Micheal Bay, the director. It was his first real movie. Bay went on to do the Transformer movies and Armaggedon, so you get the action connection.There's violence and plenty of STRONG LANGUAGE. PROBABLY NOT FOR KIDS. Because BIG ACTION movies are not my favorite genre, I give this movie 3 1/2. But, because I can't give it a 3 1/2, I give it a 4. If you like action movies, you might even give it a 5."
2,the best film in my life,it's from Africa i write.This film i can watch it everytime.These are comedy;action(very good action)and Martin Lawrence is good in his starring I hope that Will Smith will make'BAD BOYS 2'.I will be the first at cinema to watch it
3,Lousy plot sinks this lame action flick,"I really wanted to like this movie. Smith and Lawrence and Pantoline in a cop buddy-buddy action film; it should be great! Will Smith is the rich kid, suave and sophisticated, who is a cop because he wants to do good. Martin Lawrence is the family man who can't seem to find an opportunity to do it with his wife. And Joey ""Pants"" is their tough tlaking boss.But its not very good. Lots of guns and car chases, but the humor is forced and the plot is not just predictable but stupid. ""Bad Boys, Bad Boys, watcha gonna do when it makes you puke?"".Any of the Lethal Weapon movies are superior to this film."
2,Good god this movie was bad,"Matrin Lawrence and Will Smith are 2 of the best comedians/actors alive, and they do NOT shine in this crap. Lawrence and Smith play 2 narcotics detectives who have to bring down some illegal dealarship run by (who could it be) Russians. This movies humor is gross, nasty, and oh yeah, not funny. (There is a gag where Lawrence shoves an attackers head into a full urinal). Nearly all my friends loved this movie and the sequel more, and, I will say online, that they are idiots."
4,"Nice, But Tristar Needs to 'SUPERBIT' this title!","Though the film is extremely entertaining and the documentary is also enjoyable, the studio needs to release a 'SUPERBIT' version (higher quality video standard that utilizes space on the disc normally reserved for special features for picture quality instead) of this title like they have for 'Vertical Limit', 'Dracula', and 'Johnny Neumonic' to truly earn the 5th star.Unfortunately, Bad Boys looks grainy on a 65"" rear projection Widescreen TV when compared to high quality mastered titles like Star Wars, LOTR, and The Rock: The Critereon Edition and Superbit titles, which still looks razor sharp at this size."
4,I was there,I was at Insurrextion it was my 1st WWE event live and it was great being there live. It was an awesome feeling and I got to see the late Curt Hennig's last ever WWE match against Goldust. After watching the DVD however I must say it wasn't great watching it on TV. But it was still an OK event so I give it 4 stars.
2,Pocket Book,"Now that i've lost the product (last day or two) I'm really missing it since I used it on a regular basis to write important tidbits of information for work. Either way if you're looking for a small note book, don't make the same mistake I did and look for something cheaper. $10 is too much for something that you're probably going to lose, I should've bought a 10 pack of crap notebooks for $5."
2,The Cat Who Went to Heaven by Elizabeth Coatsworth,This book was written in 1930.This book was about a artist and his cat. Their was a high preist that came to the artist to ask him to paint a picture of their Lord Buddas death.This painting would include all the animals that came to be blessed by budda and a cat who refused budda teachings. The artist's cat good fortune was so happy that the artist painted a cat that she died and went to heaven from being overjoyed. When the priest saw the painting he was angered and refused to hang the picture in the church and the picture would be burned.I didnt have a favorite line in the story and Personally I wouldnt recomend this book to anyone.
3,No More Prisons,"sorry, i haven't read the book yet, but i promise i will. instead, i'm more interested in seeing some kind of ""Winner Takes All Indian Leg Wrestling Death Match"" contest between ""Neil M."" and ""J. Mark Kulik""; Now that I'd pay good money to see..."
2,Interesting cast... low production value,"I found this episode interesting, mainly for seeing Leslie Nielsen earlier in his career. Shot in early bw video tape, the contrast is typically harsh and reflections saturate the vidicon camera tube. But, historically, a pretty neat little series to be able to watch"
3,Keeps You Laughing,"Rohit Shetty begins GOLMAAL 3 with a few collage shots of GOLMAAL and GOLMAAL RETUNS. He has every reason to do so. After all, both clicked with the audiences and set the cash registers ringing. But they also bring with them a humongous set of expectations for GOLMAAL 3.GOLMAAL 3 promises to be bigger. Not only the characters, the number of action sequences, gags are a lot more than the previous two editions. You also have a dog this time named 'Facebook'After GOLMAaAL, GOLMAAL RETURNS and ALL THE BEST, Ajay Devgn teams up with Rohit Shetty yet again this Diwali. Their combination has proved to be very successful. Also, in the recent past, Ajay has excelled doing comedy and action, something which this film has aplenty.All in all, a Cracker of a film!"
2,4 Stars for the first 75 minutes ! 0 Stars for the last 13 minutes,"Kevin Kangas is a fresh new Director with alot of talent & i love his follow up to this film ""Fear Of Clowns"" & i also was enjoying the hell out of ""Hunting Humans"" until we hit the last 10-15 minutes of the movie head on & it goes from being a very creative & realistic low-budget film to being a corney lame un-realistic & ilogical karate kick of a ending. The movie is not completely ruined because of the ending but i will say that Kevin Kangas & company were about 13 minutes away from giving birth to a low-budget masterpiece & then it slipped out of there hands & hit the floor & slid on the afterbirth into the oblivion of good movies with very bad endings. What the hell happend Mr. Kangas?"
1,I would rather be swimming in a pool of liquid cow stool!!!!,"I have found the worst movie ever made. This movie is supposed to be low budget, but it is realy no budget. I love low budget movies, like Evil Dead, and Texas chainsaw massacre just to name a couple but this was horrid. I did not rent a horror movie to see a male underwear model rolling around on his bed, or constantly driving his car around. I couldn't watch anymore, so just to see who the other serial killer was, i fast forwarded to the part with the twist and regurgitated, and i realy enjoyed the lines like ""where is underwear model today?"" ""he is sick"" ""sick? that is not like him"" or something along those lines. Yeah it's not like someone to get sick. I realy don't care anymore"
3,GOOD DAY FOR A HANGING on DVD,"There are quite a few things wrong with this movie but it still holds the attention without being irritating. Fans of Westerns will probably find it interesting.The DVD is quite good although excessively grainy in some shots. Colours are good, the images are strongly focused and the sound is clear and clean."
4,An Awesome Read!,"I loved this book. This is the first novel I've read by Sanders and it's certainly not the last. The main character is immediatly likable and any twenty-something can relate to her. With strong integrety and a quirky sense of humor, she makes the book a breeze to read through. The mystery is fast paced and intrigues the reader with each new chapter. Nothing monumental or legendary about the writing. Just a straightforward, fast-paced mystery that will keep you company on a rainy day."
3,Casters for the 18 gallon iTouchless Trashcan,"Maybe it's just me, but I assumed that the 4 wheels came on a stand or a base. Turns out, for $15, they send you 4 wheels that you have to screw into the base of your trashcan. In general, they roll well, but if the wheels are turned weird, the trashcan slides more than it rolls. On linoleum floors these casters are pretty useless. The trashcan slides easily without scratching my floor. The price isn't anything to brag about and they don't make that much of a difference. It would probably be useful on carpet or textured surfaces. I personally wouldn't buy them again."
5,Drop and Roll Funny,I loved it! It has the same off kilter spin on Hollywood as My Fractured Life does. You will fall out of your chair.
2,Katie Melua deserves so much better,"I have to support the remarks Walter Kawai made in his review. I think it's common sense to reduce sibilance when working with vocal recordings and not to increase it by using, somehow, a combination of treble boost with reverberation. I don't understand why the vocals of Katie Melua were processed in this way. It's definitely annoying and causing ear fatigue. Maybe not everybody is experiencing this, it can depend on the kind of stereo system, speakers etc. you've got but a well mixed and mastered CD should play on every system in an acceptable way.The fact that certain parts are clipping is, very unfortunately, a common aspect in modern commercial recordings. Everything has to be as loud as possible, even this kind of music, which would be so much better without being hypercompressed. It's too bad, 'cause the songs are very nice."
3,few great songs,"few great songs make the album a worthy purchase. Melua has great voice and given the right song writer and producer to give her an original edge, she may develop into a great artist. But half the songs in the album lacks originality and is comprised of mish-mash of genres ranging from soft jazz to blues to pop."
5,Easy Listening,"The music and lyrics were fresh, original and up-lifting for every song. I will buy more of her albums."
4,A Nice Change of Pace,"I stumbled across Katie Melua's song, ""Nine Million Bicylces in Bejing,"" while looking for something else online. After hearing a sound bite, I was hooked. In some of her songs on this, her second album, Melua's voice is almost impossibly beautiful. If her lyrics were as spectacular as her vocals, she would be even more popular than she already is. Although her music is not of a genre I would ordinarily listen to, her exquisite voice puts her among my current favorites."
2,Devolution,"DevolutionWhile I have always been an avid fan of Nora Roberts, almost compulsively so, I have found myself of late growing weary and and disappointed. Nora, the queen of characterizations, has reached the end of her archetypes. From the first introduction of Stella, a seasoned NR reader can easily predict with whom she will be paired, befriend and the demons to be fought. Roz and Logan and Harper have appeared before, each with her or his 'clever' thoughts and glib language and inevitable reactions. Nora's writing has grown lazy, with each character sharing the same pedestrian voice, and without context, each is nearly indistinguishable from the other. I long for the days of Honest Illusions and the McKade brothers, when I was surprised by the genre and amazed by Nora's ability to defy the cliches of romantic traditions. When will we see her kind again?"
3,I lost some interest in the middle of the book.,It was an ok book but not the thriller that I expected. I have not read Nora Roberts in a long time and this is so different from the Historical Romances that I enjoy.
2,Very uneventful,This was the first book I read about the oh so wonderful Nora Roberts. I was not impressed at all. This book was plain old boring. I mean who couldn't figure out who the ghost was? I mean she told us right from the start. No real details. I could see Logan and Stella a mile away. I have read the other reviews and I know that Nora Roberts is a good author/writer. I sure hope that book two in the trilogy will have more substance. I am off to start the Lighting series. I would pass this book and wait till June2005 for book two. You won't miss much.
3,Not Nora's Best,"I'm not sure what was going on in Nora's head to publish this book, but I can't help wondering if someone else wrote it and stole her identity! Her writing is usually so much better than this. I wish I could say something really positive about the story but it's like the clever Nora has been blinded (perhaps by rose colored glasses). I thought I would go crazy if she made one more flower reference. The three stars I give her are purely for my absolute love of her talent and my hope that her next book will be back to the standards we all expect from her. In the meantime, if you want great romance, drama, or erotica, try ""Bedtime Stories for Women"" by Nancy Madore, or ""To Die for"" by linda Howard."
2,Did Nora Roberts actually write this?,I've read just about everything Nora Roberts has written. I cannot believe Nora Roberts actually wrote this - it must have been a ghost writer. The characters lack all the charm and depth one expects to find in a Roberts novel. I won't be moving on to the next two novels - I simply don't care enough about any of the characters to see what happens to them.
4,Good introduction to the subject,"A captivating read with some new and interesting insights into the theory of networks. My only complaint is the total lack of math to support the discussed ideas. A little of graph theory (which is very straight forward) would go a long way to get a more solid grip on the subject. For a more mathematically inclined reader I would recommend `Six Degrees' by Duncan Watts. However, this is a good introductory book to the field with some interesting insights, so if you are interested in the subject, it is definitely worth the time.Those coming to the subject after reading Gladwell's works (Tipping Point/Blink) will find this to be a much more concrete and dare I say, helpful! For a more sociological analysis of same phenomena you may want to check `Emergence' by Steven Johnson or `Wisdom of Crowds' by James Surowiecki."
1,"Discomfiture, anger, displeasure","This book is quite an unassuming work, full of redundant repetitions, inadequate citations, examples nothing to do with the subject-matter, incoherent and obscure trains of thought and a lot of uninformative bla-blas and small-talks. Moreover, the text does not construe, not edited properly and literally worthless. A total bust, which can not be salvaged by the freshness and excitement of its issue."
2,A Two Hour Cliche,"I could not disagree more with the other reviewer. This ENTIRE film was totally predictable. It was a series of scenes that we've all seen a thousand times in our lives all put into one movie. The first hour is excruciatingly boring. The lead character (besides his hideous ""man bangs"") just ""broods"" in scene after scene, troubled for seemingly no reason at all. His boyfriend, a ""wifey-queen"" in every respect, makes the whole scenario a very obvious role-playing thing. It's another film about an un-accepting family and the 'should a kid be raised by gays' thing, which we've all seen 100 times. It is very melodramatic, almost laughable in several parts. In fact, the very problem is--it's TOO ""normal."" Is that what we see movies for? The other reviewer said 'finally something DECENT.' Must ""decent"" be so extremely boring?"
4,Good,"Received book in great condition and only a few days after I ordered it also, it's the instructors review copy instead of the student text but it turns out that I now have the entire class schedule before the rest of the class!!! hahahaha =] which is great because i tend not to pay attention in class sometimes =]] anyway would definitely buy from this seller again."
2,Mr. and Ms. God and the Kitchen of Creation,"While non-religious people may like this book, people who are truly religious will find this book counter-productive, sacriligious, and possibly downright insulting. The artwork is truly nice, but the content goes against all the basic principles of creation from a Judeo-Christian standpoint. My wife purchased this book because she thought it was ""cute"". After reading it, all I could do was say ""wow"". I explained to my wife that this story should not be read to our kids unless they can understand that this is a fictional story that is not to be believed. The concept completely takes away the concepts that are taught in most Christian churches."
3,Dead,"I was a little unsure how to rate this watch, I mean I love the watch and it is just what I wanted. Only thing is, the battery was dead when I got it. It would also be much better if this was made in the USA and not Japan. Update: after replacing the battery, the time adjustment knob fell off."
2,Winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award?,"To be fair, Atomised has some very brilliant, thought-provoking ideas- however, I am not into smut, which this book seems to have a cornucopia of... In between the brilliance was too much vulgarity, shallowness, sexual addiction, pedophilia, desire for incest, extreme hazing, extreme depression, dysfunctional personalities, and suicide... I suppose one could argue that `this is life,' but my response to that would be- can't one save the money by watching the news and getting the same story versus shelling out hard-earned cash for this book? Oh, and for those of us who read Asimov's final Foundation book, the Atomised epilogue was the least impressive part...reinventing the human race...been there done that book-wise. I suppose Atomised has some interesting statements to make about the time in which it was written, but winner of the International IMPAC Dublin Literary Award? I just don't see it."
2,Must have been mildly interesting,"I know I read this book, but I can't remember a thing about it besides the fact that I finished it. That means that I must have found it at least mildly interesting, but obviously fairly unmemorable. I remember brothers and one of them is a genius and the other is an overgrown party boy. Maybe. I had a lot of ""edgy"" friends who talked up Houllebecq as their favorite author, so ballsy, intellectual, put-it-all-out-there. I clearly did not come away as impressed with his work. (Also, I didn't know that this is the same book as ""The Elementary Particles"", which I also bought.)"
1,disappointed,Came straight home from the post office to play this CD on my computer. I don't have a regular cd player. And it won't play. Only a video. Now what!
4,"Worthwhile, but not a good first buy","Frankly, I'm appalled by the number of one star reviews for this fine collection, but neither do I think it worth a full five stars. Let's be honest--it has its flaws: poor original recordings which have been lovingly retouched. But I hear in some of these recordings some true soul you don't find on the more polished stuff. If you're just getting into Bob, this probably wouldn't be the set I'd recommend, but if you've already worn a groove in your Legends CD, you might want to give this a chance. Personally, I found it very refreshing to hear different versions of cherished favorites and few new tunes--and the quality is certainly listenable. Definitely pricey though for what you're getting--but maybe not so when you compare it with your average bootleg. And the title is definitely misleading."
4,Original Dubs & Riddims,"Great CD with a bunch of rare and old tracks from Bob Marley's early years. A great buy. If you are a long time bob marley fan, or this is your first album, you will enjoy it."
2,Not what I expected,This magazine was a little more farm oriented than I expected. It also is not a very inviting format.
2,Countryside Review,"Not so good compared to Mother Earth News, Farm Journal and other simular type reading."
3,Should be titled Forgiving and Moving on IN RECOVERY,This is first and foremost a book to help people deal with forgiveness and letting go as it relates to recovery from an addiction. This book was not helpful to me. I was just looking for a general book on forgiveness and this is just not it.
5,Chicane - Behind The Sun,"I've listened to the whole album and I think It's one of the bests there is!!!My favourite songs of the album are:-Halcyon-Low Sun-Saltwater-Autumn Tactics-No Ordinary Morning-Don't Give It Up-AndromedaIf you like 'Soft-Trance' or just chilling Music, YOU SHOULD HAVE HEAR THIS CD!!!I hope I've interested you, to listen or buy this CD!!!"
4,Great book for teaching literacy,"This is a great book if you are trying to teach Braille. It works for small chlidren learning to read for the first time or for adults who have lost their vision. I love, love, love her functional approach. It includes ideas like having a braille rich environment and creating stories together in braille. It gives all the steps you need to provide braille instruction. Through Patterns away - it's boring! This is fun and custom made for your kids or adults!"
1,reverse rascim at its finest,what one person thinks is a funny flick another is offened by. If a movie like this was made putting white culture over black culture it would be called blacksploitation. I was thoughly disgusted.
1,Not What I Had In Mind.,"I knew the movie would be stupid,but I decided to see it because of these three reasons:1.I had nothing else to do that day.2.I thought it would have some funny moments.3.Last,but not least,Denise Richards!These three reasons dragged me to the movie theater.Before you know it,I was watching it.After the movie was over,I was thrilled to death because the movie was finally over.This movie is just plain horrible.It is stupid and is a waste of time.The only memorable part is the cat fight between Denise Richards and the other woman.Stay away from this movie.Peace Out."
4,Very Funky-Funny Movie,"Eddie Griffin is great in this movie. So is Dave Chappelle. Most of the comedy is mild, but there are a few parts that make you laugh so hard you barf! This is a very original comedy that deserves nothing less than 4 stars. I definetly recommend this movie if you can find it cheaper. The special features aren't that good."
1,negative 5 stars,"this is the worst movie to come out so far this year. It tried to be as funny as Austin Powers, but it isn't. the plot is shallow (some would say non-existent), and the humor is based on cliches that have been played ad nauseum. If you really want to watch this movie, wait until it comes out on disc or tape or whatever."
1,Just Stay Undercover!!,"This film was BAD BAD BAD it had nothing but bad black comedy and bad remarks towrd white people NOT ALL OF US WEAR PLAD EDDIE! As I watched this movie I got so [mad] at the plad jokes and the dorkey ""Nutty professer"" impression that i couldn't take it this movie needs help and the casting is just bad so folks dont waste your time and money seeing this Junk. the only high point in the film is a some what lesbo scene between the white devil and the black secret agent."
5,Undercover Brother Funniest Film Since Tommy Boy,"If you love the comedy of Chris Farley, or maybe the genius of Mel Brooks, Undercover Brother will satisfy until the end! Though not made by SNL Studios, you wouldn't doubt it if I told you it was. Chris Katan is absolutely off the wall in this film, one of the best roles I've seen him in. If you liked his hilarious style in Night at the Roxbury, you'll definatly enjoy his charisma in Undercover Brother. Eddie Griffin makes the movie come to comedic life from the start. He absolutely has enough soul for the role! The movie is fun thoughout and dosen't have to fall to low levels to get you to laugh! It is a clean, fun, 70s-funk film that will leave you sore from laughing!"
3,"Funny bodies, sexy viewing","Funny parody on parody, it is a sexy comedy of kind Afro-American folks had taken over a gang of heartless white co-citizens.Nice bodies, funny tricks, passing time easy."
5,Excellent source,"I actually got the copy from the local library and did not expect much from this book. You know how most of American books on the subject are, bright pictures like in the books for 4-years olds, and about the same intellectual level of content repeating the same shallow stuff about putting cuneiforms onto wet clay tablets with a sharp stick.Not this book. It's past midnight and I still cannot force myself to put this book down. For my writing project I am interested in the actual details: How did the dress looked like? For a man? For a woman? For a priestess? How rich dress was distinctive from a poor one? What they did first thing in the morning? What was on their feet? How did they wash themselves? The book is rich with these details, and if they show some medival picture, they don't pretend, it's accurate. Or, more precisely, they tell about each illustration how close to the real picture it is, what's right on it, and what's not. O-o-oh... good!"
2,Sorry don't like it,"I am dissapointed with Zao's new album, I bought it expecting and hearing great things about but no dice. Every song sounds the same. It is defiently the traditional Zao sound with Dan's screaming voice, the guitar riffs and drums but it doesn't have the magic as their older albums do. Fear fails in comparision to Save yourself From Hell or even Parade of Chaos. Funeral of God was an amazing piece as well. This one feels rushed to me, it came out too soon after Funeral. And the recording is really annoying, especially the ending part on the last song. It seemed endless, I thought it would never stop! I'm a big Zao fan but this album didn't do it for me. Maybe next time guys."
3,WHAT THE HELL???????,"O.k. I love Zao, The album is good, but THE AUDIO IS HORRIBLE ON THIS! I thought something was screwed up with my car stereo (which is very expensive and fine-tuned) I took the cd out and put Between the Buried and Me back in, which sounded excellent (of course). So I put Zao's cd back in, and yep, its the recording. First off, the vocals sound great, really raw and harsh, the guitar sound o.k., but most of the drum recording sounds like crap, THE KICK DRUMS SOUND HORRIBLE ON SUBS!, very muddy and not like kick drums at all. and IS THERE A BASSIST RECORDED ON HERE? You cannot hear (OR FEEL) THE BASS GUITAR AT ALL, Which is what a bass guitar is suppose to do, create bass. I dont know if they mixed this with tiny headphones on or what but this is very disappointing to listen to on a stereo, otherwise the album had a lot of pottential. DOWNLOAD IT AND BURN IT INSTEAD, THE RECORDING SOUNDS LIKE IT WAS DOWNLOADED ANYWAY."
2,Doctoral thesis or yoga?,"While there were some interesting observations, it reads more like an academic paper than an exploration of yoga. Try Nada Brahma: The World is Sound if you want , well a better read."
1,What a nightmare!!!,"My 3 year old son received this as a Christmas gift. I wish I had the gift receipt!! It was a complete nightmare to put together and refuses to stay together for more than a couple minutes at a time. My son does enjoy playing with it, but is constantly yelling for help to put it back together. When he is finished playing, it is impossible to store the cars and other accessories inside the trailer and have it close properly. Don't waste your money. This toy truly is a piece of junk."
1,Not Impressed with Pixar's Mack Truck,"I'm weighing in on the side of those that don't like the toy. The locking mechanism that is supposed to hold the two sides of the trailer together in storage mode doesn't work. So, the trailer just splits open like a clamshell when it's not supposed to. I'm actually intrigued by the product's official photo (Amazon Video) of the boy ""pushing"" the truck...I believe he's holding the trailer together (look at his hand).Also, the cab doesn't turn in the closed mode. Who ever heard of a toy semi truck where the tractor can't turn relative to the trailer?Finally, there's a small, oval track that a car can be catapulted around...sort of. The turns are such that the car we got with the set was too big to negotiate. It would get stuck in the first curve...when it didn't flip off the track in the first place, which was most of the time. Mattel and Pixar do so much correctly. This product just feels very rushed to market. They didn't bother working out the kinks."
4,It was a hit with my 5 and 3 year old sons,"My sons really like this toy and spend a lot of time playing with it. It is a good toy for using their imaginations. It is fairly sturdy however, it's hard for them to put together themselves when they are done playing. The parts come of easily but it has managed to survive any breakage. Overall, I am happy with this toy."
1,Don't waste your money,"My husband bought this for our 3 year old son for his birthday. He is a big fan of the Cars Movie, and we thought it looked fun, with different scenes and a car launcher. Our son did love it, but hasn't played with it since the day he received it. It is frustrating for him to put together, and it is frustrating for me as a parent to put away when he is done. You have to cram all the parts into the truck, align the sides perfectly, and turn a fin on the top to lock it. No matter how many times I try, the lock doesn't hold the truck closed. If your child likes Mack, buy the Mack Truck Playset instead. It is a much higher quality toy than the Pitcrew Performance Playset."
2,Disappointed quality,"I bought this toy for my 3 year old son who absolutley loves anything Cars. I think the idea behind this toy is excellent. With that said, the quality of it is very poor and the design could use some tweeking. Some of the parts do not securely stay in their respective positions. The plastic is flimsy. The sides are difficult to put back in the trailor position. I am not sure if I would buy this toy now that I know the quality of it."
1,Do not buy it,"This toy was bought for a 5 year old who struggle with it. Putting the town together takes patience, the pieces do not lock properly when you close it so children get frustrated when they are playing with Mac and it pops open.It was a Christmas present that was left behind the 28th so 3 days is not worth the price.Maybe if you have an older child who is extremely careful with toys it will work but I have heard of many other Moms who have the same complaints.If I had the receipt I would not hesitate to return it."
5,Teri Garr Rules!!,The reknowned actress Teri Garr rules in this superbly done A&E Biography.It's a must see!!
1,Inaccurate Measurements stated.,"The height measurement of 70 inches is incorrect. When I received the rack, I opened the box, measured the rack, (and I see written on the company's box) ... it is 63 inches!! As a result of this inaccurate webpage description, the rack does not fit my 72 inch door. I'm very angry about this and plan on sending the product back for refund."
1,"cheap, weak, poorly constructed and doesn't fit 3 hinges","My sister recommended a towel rack that hangs on hinges of a door. She said be sure to have three hinges on the door for support. Got new doors in the house and made sure they had 3 hinges. Order the Hinge-It and after trying different ways to assemble it to fit the 3 hinges and calling customer service for help I noticed the picture of the product on the box showed 3 hinges on the door but the unit was only attached at two hinges, top and bottom. This was all that worked with unit and the vertical bar hangs a couple of inches away from the door so it isn't stable, It supplies hooks to increase stability but the screw length is too short since the vertical pole is a couple of inches away from the door. I am returning this product."
1,Garbage,I bought this cooler and it broke one year later. It started smoking and shorted out!!!! DO NOT BUY
1,Lousy product!,"Like many others who have reviewed this product, I was happy with mine, but after 13 months, it stopped working. I looked at the owners manual to see if I could diagnose the problem, but there was no schematics. I took it too a local refrigeration company that repairs these types of appliances and they wanted $75.00 just too look at it.If you buy one of these Haier wine refrigerators, make sure you buy an extended warranty because I'm sure that this refrigerator will also stop working some time in the future.I did enjoy it while it worked and I didn't have any problems with it, and I was able to get 12 bottles of wine in my refrigerator. I would buy another one, but I am going to look for a more reliable wine refrigerator."
1,Big Disappointment,"My wife and I received this Haier as a wedding gift. At first we loved it. After 6 months, it completely died. I spoke to Haier and they were willing to replace it, but with a purchase receipt, even after having told them it was a wedding gift. LUCKILY, we found out, around the way it was purchased through Costco; and Costco has the ULTIMATE customer service. So we returned it with no questions and received credit towards it's value; $96.00.Don't buy this, it will set you up with a big disappointment."
1,Junk,"I got this as a present. It worked just fine for about 2 years, then it stopped cooling the wine. I called the people at Haier and they basically told me tough. They gave me no remedy or service center, they told me it was out of warranty. I finally talked to someone at the corporate office who told me that they would replace it for a ""convenience fee"" of $64.99, they would throw in the shipping and handling. I would have to send them the cord and serial tag with a check."
3,It's alright...,"It's okay... This book is wildly expensive on the internet, so I was expecting something pretty awesome when I got it, but the demos are very simple, sometimes even boring sounding. I think it really waters it down because of an assumption of age. I don't know if the Chemistry Demo a Day book is any more exciting... It's a good compendium for pretty simple demos though."
1,No stars,The author is completely clueless about other religions and their basis. He cannot differentiate between religion and cultural evolution. His entire passion for christianity stems from the absence of fatherly love in his childhood and he tries to find that love in Jesus as a father figure. Adversity is never the best time to become passionate about religion as it ends up being a solace rather than a belief. More like a cult to belong to. Also Hinduism is NOT a polytheistic religion. GOD can have many forms and names just like chocolate! The author needs to understand metaphysics to understand other religions
3,An Evangelical Look at Christian Identity,"""Race over Grace"" is a theological treatment of the Christian Identity movement from a conservative evangelical perspective. As such, it looks carefully and thoughtfully at some of the most glaring doctrinal errors inherit in Christian Identity's racist theology. I thought it could have been stronger and more definitive in terms of the most obvious problems with Identity theology, it's emphasis on hate etc., but perhaps it is simply my repugnance for that theology showing. If you are not a conservative evangelical in terms of your own theology, this book might not make much sense to you. If you are, or at least, are familiar with that perspective as I am, it is a good read and lays down a well argued exploration of the doctrinal problems of this fringe, racist theological movement."
5,Taking listeners to another World,"A fantastic album, from the overture at the start thru the songs and orchestra instrumentals this is an enjoyable 67 minutes of music.The entire album works as one piece of music, with songs mixed in with orchestral tracks.The orchestral tracks are stirring and moving, I wish I could find more music like this.Turn the lights down, turn the music up loud and enjoy one of the best modern composers today..."
5,Allergies and Asthma for Dummies,"Finally, a book that quickly synthesizes complex information into usable pieces! Allergies and asthma are de-mystified with practical examples. Dr. Berger's approach is uplifting, reassuring, and warm. No preaching or insistance that you do things his way or no way as in the case of so many other authors of asthma and allergy books. Top Choice on Allergy and Asthma Network/Mothers of Asthmatics, Inc. (AANMA) book list. ---Nancy Sander, President, AANMA"
2,Review of Nuzi & Hurrians Review,"This is an extremely brief summary of articles from two volumes in Studies in Civilization & Culture of Nuzi & Hurrians. Each article gets a short paragraph of 2 or 3 sentences. It all comes to just 2 pages in standard 8 and 1/2 by 11 inch print, not 4 pages. Is it worth 6 bucks? Well, usually a ""review"" tells you more than this! For example, we hear more about Richard Starr, to whom the second volume was dedicated, than we do about Sauska, a Hurrian goddess about whose name one of the articles was written. I bought the thing to find out about Sauska, not Starr."
1,what are you thinking,"O.k. lets get started by saying that if you buy this movie you are going to come back (out of your way) to write a horrible review about it. First off steven sucks he never was good he just had good action films. The guy can't act and can't read scripts. Let's just say that there is diffinatly no good acting in this movie (other then the DEA guy who acts like it is a porn they're filming), nor is there good action, humor, diolog, or suspence. It leaves you wondering ""why the hell didn't he cut that awful mullet off?"" Enjoy!!"
2,Out For A Kill?,"It certainly was not Steve's best work, maybe close to his worst. Some of the scene backgrounds were so obviously fake. Dialog was really bad. The ""head"" af the ""bad dudes"" looked like Mimi from Drew Carey without her make up and hair.The thing is, you have to go into Steve's movies knowing what you see is what you get. Over night he is not going to turn into Humphrey Bogart or Richard Burton, any more than JC Van Damme. Once you accept this, their movies are easier to watch.That being said, I would only recommend this to DIE HARD Steven S. fans. And don't buy it, just rent it as cheaply as possible, you'll be glad you did."
2,ho hum,"Out For A Kill is not one of Seagal's better movies. It misses the mark like many films he has made that I wasn't crazy about such as The Foreigner, Ticker, and The Patriot. It's not unusual for a star to make some duds, but what is unusual is that I feel that Seagal turned out ten very fun movies in a row before being involved in some less than stellar movies. I also think that Half Past Dead and Exit Wounds were both a lot of fun and show that in recent years Seagal has delivered some decent entertainment. All actors have films that aren't the best and Out For A Kill is one of Seagal's. He's made a lot of fun movies, but this aint on of em!"
1,"disgusting, pointless, and stupid!","I rented this movie at blockbuster when I thought it would be good but it sucked. I mean i bought the foreigner and that sucked as well. This movie was barely advertised he just comes up with more and more crap to sell. His older movies rocked meanwhile, this movie sucked out loud!"
4,Hunter's Moon,"I didn't know what to expect when I first picked up Hunter's Moon. A male POV? A heroine who wasn't perfect and wanted to die? From the first page to the last, I tried my best not to neglect my other real life obligations. Didn't work. I kept sneaking back to see what else Tony and Sue would be getting into, out of, or learning. I wasn't disappointed. C.J. Adams and Cathy Clamp created a fun world, filled with interesting ideas and characters.Now, if only, I had the sequel in my hands..."
4,A Great Twist,"I enjoyed reading from Tony's point of view. Having an assassin as a hero is an interesting spin on the story line. I read Spider's Bite by Jennifer Estep and the main character in that book was an assassin as well.I didn't really like Sue because she seemed almost too girly to me for a heroin in this book and wasn't what I imagined Tony being attracted to. To me, he should have needed someone who could take care of them selves and put up a fight against their attraction.But all in all, I enjoy the Sazi series and I really like Tony's sense of humor. Looking forward to reading the others!"
3,Not the same make battery..but its good,I didn't receive the Lenmar DL4CL battery as mentioned in teh site. I got the Maximal Power battery. But this battery is also as good as Canon battery. I have charged it 4-5 times and the life of this battery is comparable to Canon battery. Hope it will perform in the same way in long run.
4,Seems to work fine,"Withholding a five-star rating because I haven't used this more than a few minutes. However, it charged fine and worked fine on the first attempt."
1,Battery will not charge,"Just like one of the other negative reviews (which I wish I'd read before buying), my Lenmar DLC4L will not charge in my brand new charger that works just fine with my brand new Canon battery. When I insert the battery, the light goes orange, then immediately goes off - and that is it. I left it for 2 hours and the light just stays off - and the battery is dead when inserted into the camera. I just printed a return authorization and it will be going back for a refund in the morning. Quality Control is lacking I'm afraid."
1,Defective battery....charged a restocking fee,"The battery would not charge and would not power the Canon 1100IS. It was the battery recommended by Amazon. The camera does work when the Canon battery is inserted. Either the battery was defective, or it was the wrong one for the Canon 1100IS. Either way, I should not have been charged a restocking fee."
1,"much better deals on better batteries, keep looking",there are 1200ma/hr batteries for much less moneyPremium NB-4L Lithium-Ion Replacement Battery (2 Packs) for Canon PowerShot SD780 ISWhy buy 1 @ 12$ that holds 760ma/hr when you can get 2 for 5$ that hold 1200ma/hr each?I purchased and used the ones from my link for awhile and they have served me well in a canon powershot elph 300hs
1,Battery wasn't charged and won't charge!,"This battery would not turn the camera on, so I charged it in the charger that came with the camera and it still won't turn the camera on. I would return it but I don't have the original packaging. Don't buy one!"
1,does not last a day,"so disappointed in this battery. first, it says on the picture its a lenmar battery, the one that arrived was a generic battery that does not have the name lenmar. then it does not last a day. have used it for 2 weeks now, have charged and discharged several times. not worth the money."
2,Arrived dead,"The battery will not take a charge. the charger green led comeson instantly like it is fully charged. I bought this because I read goodreviews about it. I am getting a replacement after a long time tryingto get in touch with Adorama, and of course I have to pay return shippingand waste plenty time. I hope the 2nd unit works."
3,50/50 chance. Your call.,"After reading the customer reviews, I went ahead and ordered two of these. I figured even if one of them didn't work, I'd still have one that worked (and still it'd cost less than the branded battery). Well, I'm glad I got two. One refuses to take any charge (the charger flashes red to green and back again. The charger isn't supposed to hit green until the battery is charged). The second one I purchased works fine, however. You're definitely taking your chances with this. But hey - even if you buy three of them and two of them are duds, you're still paying less than you would for the Canon battery."
2,Not a Lenmar from The Battery Center,I selected the Lenmar as my son has one that work great with his camera. But was sent a no name generic battery instead from The Battery Center. Whats up with this.
4,Lenmar DLC4L,"I bought 2 batteries for my camera to be used on our trip to Disney World. These batteries worked great with the Canon SD1000. It last a tad shorter than the Canon battery, but for the price, it's a good bargain buy."
4,Aftermarket battery works well,Many aftermarket batteries wear out fast. This one is great. It isn't quite as good as the original one that came with the camera but for a fraction of the price it is a great spare.
1,Battery Would Not Charge,I ordered this battery because it was about 1/3 of the price of the Canon OEM battery and it received good reviews by other Amazon customers. The battery unfortunately would not even take a charge. It is being sent back and I will likely stick with a Canon battery.
1,Failed,Battery failed to take a charge after about a year. I'm returning it to LENMAR(3yr warranty)and we'll see how that goes.
2,Mediocre Performance,The latest recording of Beethoven String Quartets by the Prazak Quartet appears to be even worse than mediocre. Prazak has chosen to express their passions through the waves of exaggerated dynamic differentiations with lots of unnecessary fortissimo and flat notes. Tasteless performance.
2,Misleading Title,"This book is not an introduction to DirectX, D3D, or C#. It is a very high-level introduction to game engine design. One could almost gain as much from saying ""Compartmentalise your objects"" several times a day.The title implies that it will give you some help understanding how DirextX and C# work together to create a game engine. This is false. There is a lot of uncommented code in this book (half the first chapter of 26 pages is uncommented code). The explanations given are abstract to the point of being worthless to someone who truly needs an introduction, giving only light glances at the example code. It is impossible to get a clear picture of everything involved.There are doubtless those for whom this book is the perfect level of abstract discussion. However, I believe this is the exception rather than the rule. Highly not recommended."
4,Not an intro book.,"If you're looking at engines like axiom, ogre, irrlicht, etc... and wondering how they do that... THIS is the book for you.Just make sure you've read at least an intro c# book and 1 or 2 direct3d books.I'm loving this book, I've read 1/4th of it over the period of my workshift... just can't put it down.Things like octrees were completely confusing me, and lynn does a great job explaining it.-1 star for not doing an octree implementation instead of a quad tree (so far... i haven't read the whole book yet), oh and i saw a ""GOTO"" statement in his code, which always urks me in OOP."
1,Code is useless.,"I purchased this book in hopes that I would be able to use the code for examples and as a guidance. However, the code is outdated and unusable. You can download a more updated version of it off of a ""fan"" website, though still doesn't work. I contacted the author on the matter, and he said, ""I'm afraid it is now becomes an exercise for you and the other readers to take the concepts in the book and work out the latest implementation. "" I don't see how one can work out the exercises on their own when they're trying to learn the exercise itself!The concepts in the book are a little useful, though without working code it seems so close yet so far away.I would not recommend this book to those looking to learn from it."
1,A very bad book,"To make its short :The code Sample doesnt work !!No UML diagrams of the ""engine""if you wanna learn about Directx programming and C# you better buy the book : Managed DirectX 9 Graphics and Game Programming . its an excellent book for that subject, but never buy this book you will waste your money."
2,nice concept but poor direct X instruction,Obviously Lynn put a lot of work into the application used as the foundation for this book but unfortunate he did not put as much time into the instructional aspect of the application. Perhaps a good book for someone experienced with Direct X programming and who just want to migrate over to C# but not for a Direct X programming novices.
5,"The ""GET REAL"" of Pants construction","I have been a seamstress for many years but have never had as much information in one spot before as in this book. It covers all aspects of making pants for regular people and for those of us with non-traditional figures. It particularly addresses the problems of older women and to me, that is very remarkable since no one else seems to think the over 30 body exists. Highly recommend this book!"
4,"Great, of course","Sarah's voice and style are terrific, as usual. However, I have to say that her version of Anggun's ""Snow on the Sahara"" is fairly bland, especially compared to the original Anggun version. Sarah has the chops but lacks soul on this great song. Everything els here is very nice."
3,Pretty Good...But Not Good Enough.,"The cd was great, but i really don't like how they didn't put all the songs from the concert. i bought the cd first and couldn't wait to see all the songs in concert, but to my suprise, some songs from the concert weren't on the cd! My favorite song from the concert, Arabian Nights, wasn't on the cd. Also all of Harem, the title song, wasn't fully on the cd!(no lyrics). To sum it all up, pretty good, but could use some improvment. but i do recommend seeing the concert."
3,"""Rough Diamond,"" yeah!","I have to agree with reviewer Bridges above, this is probably my favorite Heep album, too. But to whoever the other reviwer, that said that ""Wetton wasn't as good as Thain?"" Well...go back and check some of your album covers and see how many John Wetton's been on (or in the case of ""Asia,"" inflicted on) Anyway, ""Fantasy"" is almost literally that. The band sounds like they're finally coming into their own as a ""prog"" band instead of the braindead/headbanger mentality that finally ended with ""Sweet Freedom."" But the best track on the album? No question: #2, ""Shady Lady."" Any song, stupid as the lyrics are, that features a Ken Hensley slide guitar and a Mick Box ""lead"" guitar has to be great. Oh yeah, another plus: ""Fantasy"" doen't have any hobbity Ken Hensley liner notes either. Sorry if he don't like the album."
3,not bad!,"I don't consider this one of HEEP'S better albums. The pro-duction is pretty good; it's very bass heavy and one can hear all the instruments, but songwise, this is one of their moreforgettable albums. My favorite song is ""Why did you go""; a veryrare and successful foray into country rock. Everything aboutthis song is wonderful; from HENSLEY'S RITCHIE BLACKMORE-ishslide guitar playing, to DAVID BYRON'S wonderful vocal, to thevery catchy vocal line and the very hummable chorus, to JOHNWETON'S mellotron playing, which is unsurprisingly very KINGCRIMSON-ish. A great song and probably the main reason to buythis album.The album's closing track is also very good and hassome more great singing from DAVE BYRON. The bonus tracks areenjoyable; just wish I could recall their titles! I've neverreally liked the title track and the rest of side one (or thefirst half of the album). I dunno, maybe I should give thisanother listen or two......"
1,this cd sucks,What's the matter with you people can't you tell the awsome sounds from the awful ones this cd is garbage except for the singles I tried hard to like these songs and I can't. They are so boring and dumb. I'm planning to give this cd away for free even I can't stand it.
4,Karaoke revolution,"My girls enjoy playing this game. I bought it for a birthday party, and her friends had a ball!"
2,can u say no talent?,annoying vocals drowned out guitars after listening to a couple of songs u'll want to throw it away! i did
5,The Greatest Homemaker of All Time!!,"Martha Stewart is probably known as ""The Greatest Homemaker of all Time"".This A&E biography rules!!"
5,XL Tactical Duffel bag made for deployments or the outdoors.,"I ordered this bag to take it on a deployment training. The bag is very large. It was large enough to hold all my clothes, equipment, and the sleeping bag that I needed for the entire 7 days. The material seems like it is pretty good quality and held up well. The bottom of the bag is some type of plastic material and I have some concern of the durability and longevity. I haven't had it long enough to comment on it, but so far I was really impressed with it. If you are looking for reasonably priced tactical duffel bag, then you have just found it."
3,"Fantastic books, but...","The Winnie the Pooh stories are some of the best writing you will ever read. AA Milne has quite possibly the best writing style ever. Unfortunately, the last two books aren't Winnie the Pooh books. They are books of poems (and I really dislike poetry). Some will love that, but I was hoping for more Pooh."
4,"At last, no Disney here!","The ""original"" books by A.A. Milne, here presented, are not as ""thick"" as the ones I remember from my pre-school years, but maybe that's just me. The contents are, to the best of my memory, accurate, and happily, free of the ""Disnification"" imposed on the stories in recent years. In general, a worthwhile addition to the libraries of the ""very young."""
3,Beware of hidden costs!,"This toy is durable and really unique in it's design. I was not surprised at the size, but I was totally surprised to find out it required a special battery pack that can only be used with this particular toy. This is false advertising to me and had I not really examined the package I would have had a disappointed child because it is not very clear in any advertisements nor on the packaging that you need a special battery pack (...)"
1,DONT BUY THIS!!!!!,"This is my second review! My first review I complained about the battery pack, which I see is still an on going thing! But GUESS WHAT! This damn toy broke and my son has only played with it twice! And the $30 battery pack, runs out after 15 minutes! This stupid thing wont morf the gears are stripped out. One side wont do anything at all! I dont know about anyone else, but I work damn hard for my money, and I can not afford to piss is away. Now my son is heartbroken and wants to know why Santa gave him a bad toy! What am I suppose to say to him????? I think I will have him (my son) call customer service, and they can explaine it to him! Oh, In case anyone wants it, here is the customer service number to tyco: 1-888-557-8926.Good Luck!"
1,Still waiting to play with it!,"Like everyone else I can not find the Pro Flexpak battery. The lady at Walmart told me to call Tyco (888 number on the box) and the recording tells you to go to service.mattel.com and purchase the battery pack from them. It is $30.00 plu S&H. But the only problem is ""ALL SALES ARE FINAL"" So if your child does not like the toy you can not return the battery! So you have to hope that the toy is as fun as people have been saying."
1,Who knows how good it is because it doesn't come with the necessary battery...,"I waited in anticipation on Christmas morning as my young son tore open the paper on this gift only to discover that this rip off requires a ""special"" battery that needs to be purchased separately, to the tune of $30.00!Tyco needs to label their packaging more clearly because I would have never purchased this item had I known that there was more $$$$ involved to actually play with the thing.What a disappointment..."
1,Misled,"I can't rate this item as it does not run. Why? There is no battery pack. Why? They did not come with the toy. Why? I would love to know. The box does not tell you that you need to purchase them separately. The marketing merely suggests that you buy an extra battery pack for extended use. This has been a huge source of stress and frustration. I have two little boys who anxiously await the arrival of a shipment of batteries to the toy store. We were not the only ones misled. No store in town has any as there was a run on them the day after Christmas. If these little guys were not attached to the Shell Shocker, I would return it in protest."
5,A lost gem,"This album is a lost gem of mid-90's American power pop/post-grunge alternative rock. Echoes of the Clash, 70's garage rock, and pure pop-punk hooks. This isn't groundbreaking, but it's a hybrid that wears its influences on its sleeve and displays beautiful execution.Out of print, but highly recommended if you can find it used."
3,I'll try to be fair,I've been a huge fan of the harvest moon franchise for a long time. I wish that Bradygames had taken the fan base into account when making this guide. All of the important information can be found in this guidebook but I feel it was horribly organized and as another reviewer stated some of the information is not accurate. I suggest doing a search in your browser of choice and finding a dedicated fan website. They have been a lot more helpful to me than this ever will be.
1,A Huge Disappointment,"I absolutely adore Harvest Moon and have bought every single game released. Imagine my delight when I learned that, for the first time since Harvest Moon: Back to Nature, there would be a strategy guide. So, of course, I hurried out to buy it.What a let down. Not only does this guide spend a large proportion of its pages describing aspects of the game that are either intuitive or pretty much the same as games that have come before, but in many cases it's just flat out wrong. The map of the village it provides with its nice little numbers pointing out where everything is, that'd be awful useful. Except that it's WRONG! For the most part, the numbers don't match up, not to mention that there are more numbers on the map than desciptions following after. And that's only one example.So my advice is don't waste your money. Wait a couple of months, and then find a fan written strategy guide online. It'll be far more accurate"
2,Lack of Green.....,Would have been WAY better film if they had given Tom Green's character more time but still manages to provide a good laugh on the spray painted holdup scene.
5,Beautiful..,"This is what brought me into the world of music altogether. From the first time I listened to it, to now, I have never gotten tired of it. It is definitely worth the buy."
1,Awful,"""Antichrist Superstar"" is simply escapist entertainment for kids that are far too stupid and feeble to realise that their future is far worse than the threat of facism. Marrilyn Manson's attempt to create a... satanic... mess of guitars failed miserably - the guitars are very weak and sound more like vaccums instead of dangerous chain saws. This song may be contreversal now - but give it a few years and it will be the laughing stock of some cheesy halloween party. The only way Marrilyn gets any fans at all is simply through shock, and, like every other ""shocking"" artist (i.e. When Elvis Presley first became popular; Jerry Springer at the top of his game), Marrilyn will eventually be disregarded as the definitive message they leave in this album - silly AntiChrist shock ""metal"" band."
1,The music is boring and unoriginal,"I have no problem with Marilyn Manson or his lyrics, which some find offensive. However, I still think that Manson's music lacks originality and his act is getting old. It's just a bunch of metallic industrial sounds with a scratchy voice shouting. His guitars are horrible and the drumming isn't very clear or technical. If your looking for real metal, then Manson is definitely not it. I suggest buying Slayer or Pantera if you want powerful heavy metal; at least those bands are innovative and know how to play their instruments. This is probably one of the worst albums by Manson as well, he needs a new style and look."
1,why the blind following?,"I'd like to start by saying that I don't get offended easily, and certainly not by this. What I can't understand is why this sub-par band has such a blind, unapoligetic following. Most of the music is bad. Not because I don't understand it, but because most of the music is bad. Come on ladies and gentlemen, do you think he really believes what he sings? It's an act. Manson isn't a musician...he's a talented entreprenuer."
4,Really cool if only for beautiful people and image,"I admit I'm a sucker for stuff that causes a lot of controversy. But if the music wasn't cool Marilyn wouldn't be famous and this album wouldn't be notorious. The Beautiful People is one of, if not the, best death metal song ever so it makes the album worth your while. It'll freak your parents out too."
3,wacky,"More hummable toe-tappers from the Clown Prince of Pop. There's no holding back the smiles when this wacky guy struts his stuff. Never fear, Dr. Manson's here!"
4,probably the 3rd best,"This is probably manson's 3rd best album. Worth it for the most part, although some of the songs just make you want to jam something sharp into your ears repeatedly (mister superstar, Man that you fear) The other tracks (especially beautiful people, irresponsible hate anthem, the reflecting god, and wormboy) more than make up for this. While it is my opinion that GAOG and Holy Wood are better, this is tied with mechanical animals for 3rd. At least it isn't smells like children. So, in summary, great, but not the greatest."
4,Give me a break...it's good,"...This is not some prophetic piece of art that will change life as we know it...this album is very good, but nothing great. Trent Reznor's talent can only take a moderately talented band so far. If you disagree that they're only moderately talented, then you need not look any farther than their earlier albums, which are about as forgettable as Kenny G. The songs are interesting, but the lacking musicianship gets in the way, as they are forced to resort to sub-par riffs over and over again. Secondly, the lyrics, while occassionally quite well-written, often amount to little more than petulant whining. I understand why this appeals to teens, who are also quite adept at petulant whining, but it gets old pretty quickly.Nevertheless, it's worth buying...."
5,"The musical equivalent of Nietszche's ""Human, All Too Human""","How can something so major be less than 5 stars? This is not the 90's version of Kiss or Alice Cooper. It's the 90's version of ""Aqualung"". MM will probably make other good albums, but never again will he come up with one like this."
4,Antichrist Superstar [Explicit],"Antichrist Superstar [Explicit] being Manson's 2nd studio album and 1996 released and is a mix of industrial metal, alternative metal, hard rock and heavy metal. The sound is very reminiscent of bands such as Ministry, Nine Inche Nails ,Pigface and Skinny Puppy. The album was produced by Trent Reznor & Dave ""Rave"" Ogivilie which explains the influence of the mentioned bands. All the lyrics are included in the booklet along with several photographs of Manson. Allmusic gave the album 4.5/5 and Rolling Stone 3.5/5. I am in between and give it a 4. The album was a massive hit and reached #3 on Billboard 200. 2 singles were released ""Tourniquet"" and ""The beautiful people"". 4/5."
4,A Return to the Lost Art of the Album,"This album is a very well crafted example of an album as a cohesive, interconnected work rather than just a dozen songs. With Reznor's assistance (Trent should perhaps just go the Brian Eno route and use his talents to guide other artists rather than try to flog his own dead horse), Manson takes his place in the ranks of pseudonymed rock stars like David Bowie, Gary Numan, and Billy Starfire, who create their own unique personas and work at the level of concept-albums rather than just singles. ""Antichrist Superstar"" is an album that you'll want to listen to in its entirely--over and over again--like ""The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars"" and ""Replicas"". And that back-cover photograph (once you discard the outer cardboard wrapper) is a masterful touch."
4,Shock value included,"And what I mean by shock value is that there is no rapping going on anywhere in the album, especially at the time this was released when metal was pretty much in the crapper. Thanks to Trent Reznor's top notch production, ""Antichrist Superstar"" really shines and sometimes makes Nine Inch Nails look like a christian group. Overall a great album, but if you want Manson's best, get his classic debut ""Portrait of an American Family"", or his most recent ""Holy Wood""."
5,Anti-hate,"Love it,worth your time if your a manson fan. people are ignorant and don't wanna here your thoughts on manson. people makes jokes about the rib removel...(*NEVER HAPPEND*) Now let me educate you air heads.Manson wanted to have his ribs removed, but was unable to find a surgeon willing to do it.You haters are Ignorant, Thoughtless, and you will listen to your idiot friends who listen to garbage like Blink 182 or Whatever they call themselves, Sick puppies, Britney spears, DEATH metal (CRAP), and anything my ears will bleed to. CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP, CRAP!!!BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!"
5,THE CHILD DEVIANT,"I'D WRITE MY OWN REVIEW, ...BUT AMAZON.COM DOES IT BEST.....Marilyn Manson started out as a depraved, marginally talented group of freaks that played a caustic but undeveloped brand of metallic industrial noise. Then Trent Reznor stepped into the studio for seven months with the band, and Manson emerged with the most intense, visceral, mechanical metal album since The Downward Spiral. Antichrist Superstar is a horror-house of grisly atrocities that stains as indelibly as a bathful of warm blood. Brooding rhythms collide with corrosive samples and buzzsaw guitar riffs, while vocalist Marilyn croons irresistible melodies in the voice of a vagrant regurgitating broken light-bulb shards. Essential listening, regardless of how much input Reznor had. --Jon Wiederhorn"
3,Meh...,"I just got more into Marilyn since listening to the Matrix soundtracks. To be honest, I like some of the things he's done, (Personal Jesus, The Nobodies, Coma White, etc.) but Antichrist Superstar as a whole feels more hollow than some would care to admit. He has some good points and potent messages like ""The Beautiful People"" and ""Tourniquet,"" but a lot of the album tries selling the whole ""satanist"" angle too much, as if it doesn't believe its own image, but tries to convince itself anyway. I don't think Marilyn's a satanist... hedonist, I can buy, but not a devil-worshipper. He has talent and an artistic vision -- check out the album sleeve if you doubt it -- plus makes some very thought-provoking songs about society as a whole, but this is more of an average album that plays with the shock value too much to be entirely convincing. A handful of good songs to rip onto your harddrive, with the rest you can take or leave..."
5,"If you could only buy one cd, this should be it!","If you are looking for the most amazing album ever, you've found it! Antichrist Superstar combines the musical geniuses of Marilyn Manson with those of Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nls. Manson is the best rock star of this century. a truely wonderful expierience."
3,Uhh...,"The music on this CD is pretty decent. There is lots of depth in the texture, lots of guitar tracks, and a haunting atmosphere. However the musicianship is, quite frankly, crap. The drums are mechanical, the bass is stagnant, and the guitars rarely move away from a basic rhythm figure. The most amazing thing is how Mr. Manson forms it all into a song.Im no fan of industrial metal, but i can see why this album is popular. So definitely, if you do like industrial, get this.But, if you like your music thoughtful, creative, melodic and technically impressive - you had better look elsewhere.Hopefully now that there is a power/progressive metal (real metal) revival, attention seeking Mr. Manson will have to strip off the hype and write some real music. Until then, ill stick to Iced Earth, Hammerfall and Stratovarius."
4,"""Excellent...""","although i'm not an anti-christ myself, i really do enjoy this record. Very catchy. fun to bang your head to with your fist in the air....Very favorite track would have to be ""Mister Superstar"" followed by ""Angel with the Scabbed Wings"". Also check out ""Mechanical Animals"" & "" portrait of an American Family"". But i do recommend you avoid ""Smells like Children"" at all costs..it's an awful f***ing piece of plastic...break that CD if you come in contact with it..seriously..."
3,Not as good as I had hoped.....,"I really wasn't all that impressed with this book. The heroine, upon learning that her groom isn't who she thought he was, turns self-righteous and indignant and kicks him out of the bedroom. Never mind that she did the same thing to him and passed herself off as someone else. Then after weeks of being denied what every husband wants, she gets jealous when she thinks that he's getting it elsewhere. Then towards the end just out of the clear blue she decides that sex is now ok. Give me a break!! The only real and honest character in this book was the adorable and mischevious donkey. Personally I like my heroines with a little bit more substance and backbone. And I HATE women who make their men beg for it. This was not the worst book that I have ever read, but it certainly wasn't the best either."
2,The Two Bores of Bamarre,"Well, I read *Ella Enchanted* and I loved it very much. I heard about this book from a friend on day and I decided to buy it. To put it lightly, I didn't like it. Meryl was the stereotype princess: Oh, gosh, be a princess what a bore! I want to go be the heroine! And then there was the main character: Oh, I don't want to! I'm even afraid of spiders! -Oh please!- I kept thinking. And then there was that interesting love between the wizard and the main character. It was to put it nicely- bland and stupid, not like the Char and Ella romance. The characters were very forgettable. Borrow it from the libray, don't waste your money."
2,The Two Princesses of Bamarre,"This book wasn't all that great. Yeah sure, it had adventure, excitement and romance, all the things I love to read about when I pick up a book. But in this book, the adventure part was boring. The 'excitement' wasn't exciting. The romance part wasn't romantic. And really who cares about what Bamarre's hero did? I didn't like it. If Addie had gotten sick and Meryl was the main character, I might have liked it more. But probably not. I especially didn't want Addie to fall in love with or marry Rye. I didn't like him at all. And you can't even tell they're in love until the very end. Whenever I read romance books, I like those little tiny hints that make you totally see that they'll fall for each other. I think Addie needed someone to fall in love with to make it more interesting, and the only person that could be was Rye. This book was BORING!"
3,Charming but the ending was lackluster,"Addie and Meryl were interesting characters, though I have to say I liked Addie much better from the beginning, and Rhys was an interesting character. Levine's sense of humour comes out in this nicely, as in the case of Addie trying to operate Seven League Boots. The Gray Death was an interesting disease, and I thought the progression of it to be original. I also enjoyed the dragon's character.I had two real problems with the novel. First, Rhys' magic seemed too convenient some of the time, and when it was absent, the absence, too, seemed rather contrived. Second, the ending was the quintessential deus ex machina ending. It honestly didn't surprise me, but it certainly didn't delight me._Ella Enchanted_ was a far better novel, and a better place to start reading Levine. After that, move on to this book. On a side note, once you've spent time with Levine's Ella, you might want to try _Just Ella_ by Margaret Peterson Haddix."
5,No words can describe...,"No words can describe how much I love this book!! I have read everything by the author, Gail Carson Levine, but this book is PROBABLY my favorite of them all. The main character is a girl named Addie, who is afraid of pretty much everything, including spiders and even her own shadow!! Her sister Meryl on the other hand is brave and strong and loves swords. She dreams of battling dragons and fighting alongside her father in the war. She is Addie's hero, and they remain constantly side-by-side.When Meryl gets sick with a fatal illness, it's up to Addie to find the remedy herself, despite the long and perilous journey (and her own fears) before it's too late for her beloved sister. A favorite of both mine AND my sister's, this book will remain forevermore on my shelf with my other favorite books, MANY of them being by Gail Carson Levine. Two thumbs up!! Well, three if I had an extra one. Enjoy!! ~Rinnie:)"
4,Mostly good,"A good book to provide a pleasant distraction from studying. Yes, it was a bit predictable but that's really what I wanted right now. One criticism - why is it when women go on quests, especially ones who are learning to be strong, they are not allowed to fulfill their quest on their own? Why must they always receive help from various male characters?"
3,Obscure references,"For anyone born after the baby boomers, the constant references to TV shows, music, and movies for illustrating points makes the book nearly unreadable.She draws almost exclusively on the feelings people felt while watching or listening while growing up. Having missed that generation, I can't identify with that woman. I believe her premise, that women are shaped by the messages they receive growing up, is accurate, but she does a poor job of illustrating it to anyone outside her generation (and maybe inside, I don't know).I'd love to see this book redone with a little more relevance to all women."
2,Disapointed,I bought this in hopes it would be a good Wolf documentary. But sadly the feature did not come out well. The director tried to cram to much into its 40 or so minute run time. You see one pack of wolves working to raise pups and also one scene of wolves chasing their prey. I would have prefered it be on following one pack of wolves.
5,Impressive,"I have to agree with the reviewer who said: best movie I never heard of. Really good - fun premise, giggly in spots, but at the end of the day a very sweet romance story. Totally worth the time."
5,"I'd never heard of it, but I love it.","This is a good twenty-something angst movie. It was well acted and filmed, and the music was great. The effects didn't seem to be high dollar, but they were believable and smooth.I wasn't sure what to expect with this. Searching Amazon, it finds itself in the company of some erotica, softcore, and sleaze. This film is none of these.There was a stretch of about 6 minutes with considerable nudity. I'm sure some people could be offended by the coarser humer and the nudity, but I certainly wasn't.I buy lots of movies that I've never seen. Sometimes I get a real gem, and this is a great one.I cannot think of a bad thing to say about this movie.Don't buy this if you're looking for a skin flick. It does have a bit of flesh to see, but this is an enjoyable story."
3,Good nude scenes,"Although the story cannot keep your attention for a long time, the nude shots in a store worth it. Good shop."
4,Good overview of Haiti,"Don't purchase this book if you're looking for an in-depth travel book, an economic or cultural primer. Do purchase this book if you would like to get a general overview of Haiti, that includes a brief mention of the voodoo religion (spelled voodou in the book). It's a good starter book to learn more about the unspoken half of island of Hispanola. A quick read."
5,Excellent,"Awesome book, alot of useful info, twobears books was also a outstandingsource in their timely shipping and keeping me updated on my book!"
3,Enjoyable read. Great value,It was a fun read and a great diversion from my daily commute. There were a few laugh-out-loud moments which makes the read go by effortlessly. It is not great literature but a fun read none the less.
2,Very poor dimmer,"Besides the lack of dimming control already mentioned (I thought it was called a 'dimmer'?) rendering it almost useless, it has a sharp mold line running vertically through the middle of the plastic switch toggle which looks cheap and quickly collects dirt, making it even more visible. The only plus is that at full on it lights at 90% of full power. Many toggle dimmers without an ON detent are as low as 75% power at full on."
1,It's a renter,"Don't waste your money on this one. I love a good sci-fi flick and I love a good suspense/horror flick. This one tried to do both and unfortunately came up 0 for 2. If you are a budding film special effects student and want to see how a couple million can be blown on special effects for an otherwise worthless film, go rent this. Otherwise, save your money and watch something else..."
2,A creepy and ghastly mess,"The movie deals with a NYPD detective (Stephen Dorff) and a Department of Health worker (Natasha McElhone) who work together to investigate why people die within 48 hours of logging onto a website. (This movie reminded me of the movie ""The Ring"" and it seemed like another American remake of the Japanese horror-movie ""Ringu"".) While the images are creepy, disturbing and graphic (there are a lot of scenes that depict torture), the storyline is chaotic and illogical. I didn't know whether this movie was trying to be a horror movie, a ghost story, or a serial killer movie. It tried to be everything and turned out to be a complete mess. The graphic and creepy images are really hard to get out of your mind once you see this movie, however. It is definitely not for the squeamish!"
1,Worst Movie Ever Made,"This is the worst movie ever made. This is so dark you are unable to see the characters. the characters never turn on a light, even when the working light switch is right next to them. It rains for 3 days straight. The investigator has been working on this case for a very long time, yet a woman from the department of health comes in and finds the bad guy in less than 24 hours. Rather than shoot the bad guy with a gun, that is in his hand, he decides to type in ""feardotcom.com"" in a computer."
1,Terrible!,"This has to be one of the worst horror movies I've seen. The acting is bad, the script is bad, and it's not even scary! It's about this website you log onto and somehow it takes your greatest fear and 48 hours later you die from that very same fear. Not worth the time, not at all."
4,Not bad for a modern attempt at horror.....,"Fear dot com is a decent attempt at horror in my humble opinion. Allthough it has many weak points it also has many strong points that more than make up for the slack. The plot is original (although however, there are many similarities to ""the ring""...), the effects are superb and the acting is well above average. In an age filled with horror movies that contain run of the mill Teen hearthrobs and paperthin plotlines, Fear dot com is received by me with open arms. I recommend any true horror fan to at least check it out and give it a fair shot. It may not be the greatest horror film in the past few years, but at least it doesnt have the latest WNAB teen stars running from a second rate slasher..."
2,DO YOU LIKE TO WATCH?,"In 2002, when this film first came out, and people were just starting to log on, I could see where such a film might have been popular if done right. However since this time, similar and better films have come out putting this film on the junk heap of films that could have been.Detective Mike Reilly (Stephen Dorff) and Terry Huston of the Dept. of Health (Natascha McElhone) investigate some bizarre deaths. If you read the title to the film, you know what they all have in common. The film wasn't put together well. It should have created a mystery the audience wanted to solve and then drop clues along the way. The film attempted to do that in a haphazard fashion, but you really didn't know you were looking for something. The film really needed a star in one of the lead roles, which it didn't have. The ending was a fairly jumbled confused mess as they tried to squeeze too much into it.Parental Guide: F-bomb, nudity."
1,Fear Dot not good,First of all the producers of this movie more than obviously watched the Japanese Ringu before writing this screenplay. I went into watching this movie knowing nothing about it and 30 minutes knew how it was going to end. The only good thing about this movie is the cinematography for which it earned one star from me.
1,I wanted to do this,"Now I have done more than 60 reviews, I noticed I have never given a product only one star. This is the right time. I remembered I went to the cienma to see this and I think this is one of the biggest time losers.I didn't utter nor scream. I only remember boredom, incredulity and shame.If you don't know what a bad movie is, go for it. I don't know if you can resist watching it all along."
2,(...),"A freaky little girl that pops up all the time... a bunch of disturbing images which ultimately help a young man and woman solve the case... bad weather all the time... a piece of media which gives the viewer a certain amount of time to live after seeing it... and a crazed killer behind all of it. Sure sounds like The Ring, doesn't it? Poor acting, lack of terror, and a hackneyed plot merit this stinker a generous 2 stars."
4,Do you want to play?,"...I was so interested in seeing this for the first time because I love computers and horror movies. One thing thats possible is if you see this movie, you'd get so scared, you wouldn't blink for fifteen secounds. I almost did."
2,Good to put you to sleep.,I did not like this movie at all. That is saying alot because I try to find somrthing to like in all movies. I have tried to watch it a few time with same results. I could not stay awake. Only buy this movie if you are looking for a sleep aid.
3,"not ""as classic"" James Taylor","I love James Taylor, I have enjoyed listening to him for a long time. This is not my favorite album though. It is a little to ""jazzy"" for him. I like his classic stuff, I don't think the jazz style suits him as well. I do still enjoy it though, after all it is James Taylor."
4,JT at Christmas...,"Well, I love James and his work but this'll be the second time I've paid out for almost the same CD! A couple of additional tracks that I - like the sycophant I am, felt I couldn't be without. Still, great stuff and with Larry Goldings and Dave Grusin involved on pianos, how can it miss? 'The River' is my favourite!Happy Christmas, JT!!!"
3,"How? Why? Ah, Me Poor Heart is Broke.","It pains me to the quick, for I am a huge JT fan. Musically, he can do no wrong, but there is something not right about this album. To my astonishment, most of these tracks sound bland and even trite, and lack the signature 'knowingness' of our beloved JT. When he has recorded more standard, mainstream songs in the past, he has managed to get around what could have been a canned sound. But not here. His renderings of these standard Christmas songs teeter on the edge of being cringe-making. 'Jingle Bells' is a flat-out embarrassment. However (!!!), 'River', 'Some Children See Him' and 'In the Bleak Midwinter' are beautiful; hence the three stars - I do not penalize for the rest. And Natalie Cole helps a lot. 'Auld Lang Syne' may well bring tears to the eyes, but for the wrong reason. I am nonetheless steadfast in my devotion and am glad to read here that others have heard this disc with less disappointment."
4,Distinctively James Taylor and In the Spirit,"This Christmas album is distinctively James Taylor from the first song to the last. It is a sound, a voice, a performance that is so familiar. Apparently there is more than one version of this album out there, but the same can be said for Frank Sinatra (Come Fly With Me) and other recording artists' albums as well. But to the point, if you like James Taylor and Christmas you can still listen to James during this holiday and still be in the spirit. And I like that cover!"
5,Beautiful Music sung by James Taylor,"This is one of the best Christmas CD's I have, and I have many. I play it over and over and over. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone, especially James Taylor fans. The songs are varied which gives the CD a nice 'flavor'. Lovely songs sung by one of the 'greats' of our times.EJ"
3,Really good!,"Fans of James Taylor will not be disappointed, though I found a few too many songs that I did not know. I like the oldies, so I can sing along.. Overall, I did like it, I just expected to be able to sing along more.I guess in a few plays, I will get the hang of it!"
4,peaceful taylor,"the christmas album i've been waiting for, being a JT fan, especially because of his soft, characteristic voice and image (he may beat his children though, i don't know)"
2,Disappointed!,"How surprised I was when I started listening and realized that the music on this CD is identical to the James Taylor Hallmark CD from 2004!!!!! There is one song that isn't on the Hallmark CD... but other than that - reruns! I just can't believe that JT is in need of money so much that he would release the same music, in different order, and with a different cover photo. SAD."
1,Don't buy it!,"I am so , so disappointed in J.T.! He is my all time favorite but what a trick he played on us! This is the EXACT album that he issued 2 years ago through Hallmark stores-EXACT-even down to the liner notes. Just put a new title on it. Nasty. Bought it 2 years ago for a bargain with the purchase of a couple cards. Paid dearly for it this year because I thought it might be something new from my man. I am so disappointed :-( ..shame on you J.T."
1,Great Album,"This is a great album. James Taylor style is at his best!. Contains no so very traditional songs performed very nicely. If you like James Taylor music, you ought to have this album."
5,James Taylor for Christmas,"What a perfect, melow voice to sing Christmas music. Adds his genious artistic interpretation and style to the spirit of the joyous season. Add this one to your collection and you won't be sorry."
3,James Taylor at Christmas - Not,"James, please stay home for Christmas and work on giving us the wonderful music we are accustomed to."
1,It can't take the heat,"I am very disappointed in this pan. It can't take the heat of stir-frying. When the pan is hot, food sticks in the grooves that distinguish Circulon from other cookware. Adding liquid to dissolve the stuck food is only partly effective. It might work OK if you're only using it for vegetables, without sauce, meat or seafood. The pan is totally unsuitable to stir-frying combination dishes, and its shape and size make it unsuitable for other purposes."
2,Know your crate size and model,Missleading on the size. Does not fit all models of kennels-crates. Should have some type of size chart in the description.
4,Dog Kennel Cover,"I tried the large using the measurements provided and it was too small so I returned it and got the XL size which made the fit much better. I found that at least two or three inches should be added to the size diminsions of a wire kennel or this cover will not fit. The quality appears good if you can get the size worked out. I like the zippers, flap snaps, and the ease of installation."
5,AWESOME!!,Thank you Robert's Hickory Hill Farm. Your lemons are beautiful! They are juicy and taste wonderful. The shipment arrived sooo fast! I love the product and the company. I have ordered from you a few times and will continue to do so!
4,An Outstanding Collection,"Over 30 of the leading voices in Buddhism contributed to this 2006 edited tome by Melvin McLeod, the editor-in-chief of The Shambhala Sun.Included are such pillars as The Dalai Lama, Pema Chodron, Jon Kabat-Zinn, and Thich Nhat Hanh. Indeed, the 30 plus authors are the super stars of the Zen and Tibetan Buddhist world. Therefore, I was a bit surprised that many of the contributions underwhelmed me. I eagerly awaited the arrival of this book after devouring the 2004 and 2005 editions.(This is the 3rd in the annual series).That being said, there is still plenty to be excited about. I particularly enjoyed the story by Norman Fischer entitled, ""Wash Your Bowls."" And the poetic piece on love by John Welwood was very moving. All in all, it was a good read and I'm certainly looking forward to the 2007 edition of ""The Best Buddhist Writing."""
3,More job descriptions than trading information.,"If you have ever wondered what functions the various traders on wall street serve you might like this book. For instance what role does a sales trader play as opposed to a market maker? The chapters are each an interview with a different trader serving a different role. The only real trading interview is Trader Vic, and for that you may as well buy his book.The book is well written and informative, but it is not the same as The Market Wizards or The Best Conversations with Top Traders.If you are looking for trading ideas, one of those should make for a more satisfying read."
3,"Informative, but horribly edited","I bought this book not for its material on Roe but actually for research on Griswold. I have to say, it is full of well researched information dating back to about the 1920s debates on the 1879 Connecticut law banning contraceptives. You can't go much further back to the foundations of Roe than this book takes you, but it will be a difficult read. The editor of this book seriously failed at the job. It comes out to about 739 pages of material, minus notes, bibliography and whatnot, but there are only 9 chapters and an epilogue. To make things worse, there are NO HEADINGS ANYWHERE. Garrow jumps from character to character, year to year, and event to event with no clear breaks or organization. If you're looking for an interesting read about Roe, stay away from this book. If you're looking for information about Roe or the right to privacy, this book will probably have it, but be prepared to go through hell to find it."
4,Gotta hear it,"Claypool's bass creating the space for Henry Rollin's voice on ""Tendrils"" alone is worth more than the price of this one."
4,Baseball Players Get Down & Dirty - - sort of,"The vocals on this CD are actually much better than I expected. I mean, they are baseball players first and then singers second (I assume). But they all did a fine job and I think my favorite would be Coco Crisp - he really gets down! The CD represents a wide range of styles, too - country, rap, hip hop, blues, rock, and will delight any musical baseball fan. I'd say this selection defintely hits a home run with this listener."
5,Comfortable the 1st time I put them on,I bought the wheat and the black Nellie ankle boots. I have big ankles and they fit comfortably the very first time I put them on.I didn't have to wear them two or three times to break them in.
4,Very Satisfied,"My husband is very satisfied with this product and the price. He has no complaints with the life of the battery. He just returned from vacation, and that's the reason he bought the battery. He was able to video tape the entire vacation with no problems. Thank you for a great product."
3,3rd member of Lowry's outstanding trilogy,All three of Lowry's volumes of The Giver trilogy deal with the desire to control others. They are a powerful call for freedom's importance
5,Wow....nicely done,Read the Giver years ago when it was required in my children's sixth grade. Haunting to me as an adult even then. So glad to read the trilogy now and know what happened to that dear little boy in the Giver.
2,striking look...boring inside,the book looks like it will be good after u have read te giver but it is quite boring actually
2,disappointing,"In this book, more questions are raised than answered and since it is the last of the trilogy, this is not good. As mentioned by previous reviewers, the characters are cardboard flat. Some of the questions I had included main plot points. Why is an electronic machine bad? What happened in Kira's village to bring about literacy amongst the youngsters? If material things are so bad, why does wanting them produce such a drastic personality change in the receiver? What should the correct alternative be? Of course, a book should produce questions, but these seemed to develop out of laziness, not a desire to seriously engage and intrigue the reader."
3,Difficult to use...kids still prefer the sofa cushions,"We purchased 3 basic sets for Christmas last year and the kids were delighted when they opened the package. However, though the concept of the toy is fantastic, the execution is not. The velcro is so tough to open that my 10, 8, 7 & 6 year old children are not able to play with this toy by themselves. My husband and I have difficulty pulling the velcro apart, which very quickly becomes frustrating. The foam is thin and flimsy, and structures very easily collapse. The fabric covering is so thin and picks up every piece of dust and hair...not good for kids with allergies. This would be the perfect toy, IF the exteriors were wipeable vinyl, with thicker foam and velcro that wasn't quite so hard to open. Overall, it seems like an expensive investment for a toy that doesn't meet our expectations."
1,Pointless book,"This book is pointless. Savage simply whines about people trying to take away his freedoms... while at the same time wanting to take away their freedoms, namely pursuit of hapiness. Savage is a lost cause..."
4,Realistic story...,"This book picks up where ""The Harris Men"" leaves off and is very good reading. I especially enjoyed watching Caleb (the youngest son) rebuild his life and develop his relationship with his father.Again Mr. Johnson does a fine job of weaving a realistic story that's right in tune with today's issues. Bravo!! -ES"
3,Lyrically Roughness,"Here's a really good but overlooked CD from Death Row records. Finally, after almost 5 years, the Lady of Rage finally puts out her debut album. But no one took notice because of the revival of East Coast Rap and most female rappers's lyrics were all about sex & love. The beats are pretty good, but noticeably absent of Dr. Dre. the lyrics are hot and unbeatable. My favorite songs are ""Breakdown"" and "" Rough, Rugged, & Raw"" featuring Snoop. Although most people don't know who Rage is, I only recomend it to Die Hard West Coast fans. But check it out!"
4,"Definately phat, one of the top 3 female MC's ever...","Yes, this album tends to lack a little in the production department at times, but Rage's totally wicked lyrics and flow more than make up for it. There is at least 6 absolutely tight tracks here(beats and lyrics) and none of the tracks ""suck"" Rage is a hypnotizing MC. Nothing you heard before... I wish she got more props, she sure deserves it. I am a true hip hop fan, not just of the commercial ish, and Rage is one of my top emcees. This girl can RAP! All of the tracks concentrate on skills, tight metaphors and similes and flow. No pigeon, chickenhead we all know sex sells stuff(although I do think Lil Kim can flow too.) What Rage needs to do for 2000 is find herself some top notch production that can match her talent. Rage, please don't give up. Forget Death Row, and go girl... keep representing for all the strong, intelligent chicks out there."
1,Where is the CD?,"On October 14, 2004 I ordered the CD. As of November 15, 2004 I still have not received the CD. I contacted the seller (foxtrotmusic@sbcglobal.net) twice by email. No one responded to the emails. I would sure like to think there is a simple explanation. However, I don't recommend any purchases from foxtrotmusic."
4,pretty interesting,"I first read this book when i was in fifth grade.I think it would also be good for kids who are under 13. It's a pretty good easy read book.It had ok stories about people who fought dragons and stuff like that. Most of the stories where pretty interesting and that I've never seen before, but the real thing that I liked about the book was the illistrations. The are really eye catching."
4,11 year old Dragon lover gives big thumbs up!,"I've read a few of the stories so far and I'm looking forward to reading more. So far I've read ""The Dragon Tamers"", ""Perseus and Andromeda"", ""The Flower Queen's Daughter,"" ""Bilbo Baggins and Smaug"", ""The Devil and his Grandmother"", and ""The Good Sword."" All of the stories really held my attention and I couldn't put the book down. The only better Dragon book I've read is ""Eldest."" - by Louis, age 11"
5,"Peaceful, yet enlightening CD","The Heavens Declare His Glory is a classic, timeless piece, shared with the heart. This delightfully inventive composition and compilation of hymns speaks to the soul providing moments of illumination on the path to salvation."
4,Points off for editing,"I don't know if this CD was edited by some crazed religious group, but every swear word was removed. Pinette's stand up act is not a filth fest by any means, so someone went way overboard ""cleaning"" this concert up."
1,The Silva of California by Willis Linn Jepson,"What a disappointment! Remember that feeling when you were a kid when the ice cream falls off the cone? Well what we got here is all cone and no ice cream. The ""Silva of California"" is one of Jepson's greatest works. The original is a beautiful folio with some of the best tree illustrations ever done. What's left in this book are his dated records and musings about tree lore, but no illustrations. Save your money for the real thing."
2,NOT AS GOOD AS ONE THAT SLIDES ON COLLAR,"My late dog, Luke, had one that slid on to his collar. This velcros on and falls off. Very disappointed... oh well live and learn. I tend to suffer from the disease of perfectionism."
2,Not a Keeper,"I was quite disappointed in Anything, My Love. The characters weren't likable, the dialogue was stilted and boring and the plot was just too thin. I am a voracious reader, so I have many wonderful books and authors to compare it to. For the price of this book, you could read a Linda Howard, a Lori Foster and an Elizabeth Lowell. You'll be much more satisfied!"
3,light filtration sun hat,"This hat is a little too flimsy for my taste. For windy days it stays on since you can tighten it, but too much sun gets through. I wore it and felt uncomfortable with the amount of sun that got through. Lovely if sun blockage is not an issue."
5,cd,I love this cd. Im a huge fan a brad paisley and this cd is just like his other music. it's a great cd with great songs
4,Every business student should watch this movie!,"This movie really opens your eyes to the entrepeneur world. The director did a great job portraying different styles and aspects from each person interviewed. Every business student should watch this movie, they will gain important insight into the business environment. After watching the movie, you get a sense of ambition, and drive, to accomplish, and to keep working at and idea or business adventure!"
3,Dutch success?,"I fail to see the Dutch success as an Empire. Its trading company, the VOC, perished in a sea of corruption in 1800. Great Britain defeated the Dutch repeatedly in the XVII century. The Spaniards beat them when the Dutch tried to conquer thrice the Philippines. The VOC liabilities, particularly in the East Indies had to be taken over by the Republic. The Dutch colonies in Asia were a disaster, plagued by inefficiencies and atrocities ( the massacre at the Island of Banda, for instance, or the Javanese War). The Japanese conquered them and after the II WW, when the Dutch tried to recover them they miserably failed. And to cap it all, how many people speak Dutch nowadays?"
1,Disappointed,"Cute toy, but it this is an accessory item and you need the basic pieces first. This was not stated anywhere in the description."
2,NOT A Training Video,"Just to make you aware: while the academic observations made on this DVD have a lot of good content, this is not useful as a management or staff training video. If you are tasked with providing training for staff or managers in an organization, this will not be suitable.It is, instead, a filmed lecture by a non-legal expert on sexual harassment. He describes in exhaustive detail the behavioral and personal implications of sexual harassment, with very little practical advice or direction for leadership.Psychiatrists or psychologists might find this useful, but managers or HR practitioners will not."
5,Busy but found the time,"I feel I never have time to read anything these days, I'm glad I made time for this book. BBB helped me to discover ways to find more time for myself and for my kids. My goal is to be less busy and more balanced, but I needed a little help. This book was it!Thank you, Mimi Doe!Garland"
4,Attainable Results,"Mike Dooley's ""Notes from the universe"" always inspire and help me change. For those on the path of self-discovery who are actively attempting to release negative cognitive behavior patterns, listening to these CD's will facilitate enhanced awareness of thoughts while renewing the mind. ""Notes from the Universe"" promotes thought/action recognition. Don't miss this opportunity to connect with the universe; if you do, get ready to rumble in the jungle."
4,Typical Wrox treatment of the subject,"One of the skimpiest of the books dedicated to SQL Server sprocs, it's also among the most lightweight in terms of its content, unfortunately. There are numerous minor digressions in coverage -- like using SQL's mail sending functionality -- that really belong in a more general purpose SQL book than this one. It also doesn't delve into a whole lot of detail on any one aspect of its coverage.That said, it does covers all the basics you need to get up-to-speed on stored procedures. It's also well written and easy to read, without too much technospeak (which is not always true of other similar titles). But like most Wrox books, its index is thin and barely usable. (When, oh when, will Wrox learn how to index a book?)This is definitely not my favorite SQL Server sproc book, but for someone new to the subject, it still deserves the four stars I gave it."
2,Stay Underground,"I was told to check out UU by a friend who has similar music tastes. I also had a ticket to see them live (only because they were playing with Taproot, who I highly recommend instead). I downloaded a couple songs, and wasn't impressed, nor turned off either. Not until seeing them live was I brought to the point of laughter. They come off live as a third-rate Manson ripoff, and third-rate is being kind. I had a chance to see them again on Ozzfest, and I saw no improvement in the show. While they may be able to churn on decent music in the studio, when it comes to actually playing the songs, they fail miserably. I like most heavy music; Distubed, Staind, Cold, etc, but I just simply cannot recommend that anyone purchase this album."
5,Real Soul Singer,I have always loved this guy's singing and sorry he passed some time ago. I was glad that this dvd was available. Love the way he sang silent night. He can give you chills when he sings. Have other cds and dvds of him with the Mississippi Mass choir. He was a real gospel singer. Boy can he sing!
3,Polly pocket Advent Calender,My daughter who was just under 6 yrs old was able to know what day it was during the month as she opened each day. She enjoyed seeing what she was going to get each day for the polly.
1,very dissapointing,"I was really looking forward to reading this book after all the positive reviews. All I can say is as a gay man whos been out since the age of 15 who is in a realationship of 30 years. This book told me nothing and explained less. It would seem the only people to benifit from this book would be 20 something, Circut Party, very affluent gay men who are unable to form relationships. If this is you buy this book if not don't."
5,Incredibly Insightful and Thought-Provoking,"I was amazed at the parallels I was able to draw between what Downs discusses and my personal experiences. Not only was this book thought-provoking, but it was an interesting explanation to some behaviors we as gay men stereotypically exhibit.The words in this book will resound in my head for years to come. It would be truly unfortunate if I did not allow what I have read in this book to profoundly impact my life henceforth. If you are a gay man, a parent to one, a family member, a friend, or even if you are curious about the lifestyle and the behaviors associated with it, you owe it to yourself to read this book."
2,cookie cutter psychotherapy,"i'm glad many gay men have found this book helpful, and more power to them. i think it starts off fairly strong with observations common to most gay men as they develop--the implicit abandonment by fathers who are ashamed that their sons are gay and/or insufficiently 'masculine.' the rest of the book i did not find very insightful. it's probably a problem inherent in trying to write a book for all gay men that it would speak to gross generalities and (correct) stereotypes about gay men, but my bigger problem is the lack of meaningful analysis as to these very issues. this might be the definitive book on this subject for now, but it will be displaced once someone actually writes a good one."
5,Best weaning book out of 3 I've read,"I feel like I had tried everything to wean my 17 month old as I had many issues with nursing (clogged ducts, infections, etc.) - this book suggested adversion and how adding distastful substances to the nipple may discourage nursing! It worked - I mixed some onion soup mix into a paste, spread it on and she wouldn't come near me! It took several days, but now I am free. The book is very encouraging and gives lots of pratical advice that this mom who nursed 2 kids never knew. Well worth the cheap cost."
5,ToLabor Doula Certification.,I purchased this book as part of my doula training and certification thru ToLabor. I use it periodically as a resource.
3,Nursing Book,This book has some good information in it. It has answers for just about any breastfeeding issue you would have. However I did feel that the author had an attitude that her way was the only way. She talks about feeding on demand and with twins that was just not possible for me and for the average mother we need some sort of schedule. I wish it would have had more information on breastfeeding twins as well. Very straight forward book with factual information. Not a whole lot of personality.
5,Praising in the car,"We got this for our kids, ages 5 & 3.5 years. Our daughter, the 5 year old, kept telling us about singing the ""Na-na-na"" song in Sunday school and wanted to get it to listen to in the car. This is a fun CD. It turns out the kids know MOST of the songs on it from Sunday school, and we also know most from our Wednesday night praise times. We can listen to this one over and over and not get tired of hearing the songs! It's also fun for the WHOLE family to be able to praise God together."
4,Hilarious!,"This is another great trilogy from Weis and Hickman. Unlike the other trilogies, this one is pure fun. The plot is good and the characters are truly memorable. Matthew is my favourite and I also liked Pukah."
3,A surprising ending,It will be short. A great sieres but i didn't like the ending. It was too realistic for my taest. I know a lot of people who like it and the book was realy great but i didn't like the ending
2,This thing sucks,"I bought this thing to hold my note cards and I hate this thing. BAD QUALITY, BAD DESIGN, HIGH PRICE."
3,Does as Advertised,"Made with Cheap Plastic, be careful with the lip of the lid as it can cut you if you are not careful."
3,Pretty good.,"Don't buy the whole album. Just buy Dwele's track, and Mint Condition's track.Then go buy EWF's real stuff."
4,Worth a listen...,"This cd has many good points. If you're a hard core Earth, Wind & Fire fan, keep an open mind. There are some jazzy, interesting and entertaining interpretations and I really enjoyed it. Try it out!"
3,from sixteen stone to this?-dang,"""sixteen stone"" is easily one of my favorite albums of all time.with RS, bush tries to mellow it out a little bit-and fails for the most part.""swallowed"" is a much weaker track than many point it out to be and the only thing carrying this cd is ""mouth"" which would kick even more if they didn't screw around so much during the song.definitely a misfire from 16S but still the same old band."
2,"Soulless, effortless, mercantile crap from the Bushmeisters","The lyrics on Razorblade are just as bad as on Sixteen, if not worse, and only one song, ""Greedy Fly,"" has a remotely catchy riff to it. ""Personal Holloway"" might be listenable if it weren't so damn boring. I was amused by this album at first, but I found that on repeated listens, it's a rather painful experience. The chorus of ""Swallowed"" is pretty funny, though. And here's the exceptional chorus of ""Mouth"": ""Nothing hurts...like your mouth!"" Now there's lyrical brilliance. Razorblade Suitcase confirms my suspicions that the lone reason Bush got anywhere was because they had a pretty-boy frontman. It's scary the way the music industry works these days."
5,"Not just Bush's best album, a great and overlooked post-grunge album","Lately I've been going through a lot of the 90's stuff in my collection, and started listening to Bush again in a fit of nostalgia. Very radio-friendly, forgettable stuff if I can be honest. I don't anticipate again dusting off Sixteen Stone for a long time, or even Golden State.But Razorblade Suitcase... this album does not sound like typical Bush (aside from the radio single ""Swallowed"").I've come to consider Razorblade Suitcase as not just Bush's best album, but a great 90's album that showcases what post-grunge could've been.Razorblade Suitcase never reached the popularity of Sixteen Stone so, sadly, all successive material played it safer. Nothing ventured, nothing gained."
2,Faded into oblivion,"I loved this when it first came out. Now I wonder what I saw in it. I still listen to Sixteen Stone occasionally, but Razorblade Suitcase has faded into oblivion in that stack of CDs I haven't put on in years. I guess it had its time and its place, but zero staying power. The test of time is foolproof."
4,Alot different from their first one.,"Bush's Razorblade suitcase is very good album, but is missing a few what could of been a few more better tracks, although every track is good.Its quite a raw sounding album, but the guitar playing is great, particularly on ""Greedy Fly"" with an awesome intro on the guitar.Probably this is their best albums, probably cause it was'nt killed by the radio."
2,Thumbtack paper bag,"2 1/2Bush's seemingly hurried follow up to an already overly successful debut is prototypical sloppy seconds, with too much distortion covering up too much shallow songwriting, not without its electric pop prowess, though ultimately aimed to drain grunge dry."
3,No Sixteen Stone,"So we were all anticipating the sophmoric release from the band that got us up and rocking with there freshman debut, but Razorblad Suitcase needed some work. While it was slighty heavier than Sixteen Stone it lacked the free spirit. I think that the band just figured that any effort was a good effort considering the success of the first album. That is were bands get lazy. Although I haven't been to kind with this album it did offer a few good tracks. Greedy Fly is probably the most popular of songs, because it got the most airplay. My favorite is Insect Kin it showed me that Bush can have fun with a song as well as rock out to it. So if you are expecting the same feeling that you got from Sixteen Stone then don't waste your money, but if you just want a so so effort then this is the album for you."
4,"Good album, but what happened?","I remember seeing Bush in 1996. During that time No Doubt opened for Bush. Yes that's right kids! Success comes and goes for most bands. Bush nowadays would open for No Doubt. Ironic don't you think? A lot changes in time. This album is good, but what happened. What happened is people started moving past grunge after 1996. After bands like Nirvana people held onto the dream. I myself included. But it is over. Everytime I go to Pearl Jam concerts I see people with Nirvana t-shirts, but sadly I've moved on. What other choice do we have."
1,The worst record in my collection.,"A singer who can't sing, a guitarist who can't play, and a drummer that can't keep time... it's like swimming with lead weights tied to your feet. Add to that puerile songwriting and second-rate production and you have a real stinker on your hands. This record does have one saving grace: it makes an adequate coaster."
3,There's a reason you haven't heard of them.,"It's safe to say that Puzzle Gut's mark on the hard-core punk scene will not be a large one.The wacky song ""Cow"" takes a break from the norm and would make a nifty addition to a party mixed tape. And the boys do have some fine musical skills (evidenced by the last song on the CD, ""The Bones"",) however, these skills are often overshadowed by banal lyrics and an over-reliance on power chords.It's worth paying for it used, but not much more."
5,Thorough and general treatment of practice of deceipt,"A certain dry humour makes the book very readable. The description of social pressures in learning to lie, and animal world comparisons, are a useful perspective. The central theme - the danger of lying to oneself, or self deception - is of great importance in working in any large organisation. I would prescribe it as essential reading for managers and directors of most modern organisations Many readers may lack the objectivity to appreciate and believe the reports contained in the book, though they are well researched and well documented. I hope the next edition may spend more time in coping with lies. There are 13 pages in this book on therapeutic approaches toward the deceitful person. The comments on ""groupthink"", which involves bias of group behaviour, could also be expanded in future editions, with comments on the efficacy of countermeasures."
2,Only for academics,"Disappointing. The cover and the provocative title suggest a general-purpose work, perhaps in the style of Oliver Sacks or Atul Gawande, but in fact, it is (as one of the cover blurbs puts it), a ""scholarly work"" - wooden, academic, and snore-inducing prose.Is the information good and useful? Maybe. Will you enjoy reading this book if you don't have a professional interest in lying and liars? Not a chance.What a shame. This had such potential to be a great book on a fascinating topic."
3,slippers,"These are cozy and cute. I am not a fan of the microfiber feel and smell. I have many acorn slippers, these are not my favorite."
4,Comfy slippers ..,"Plush,soft and comfortable,wish they were sized a tad larger .Worthwhile and value priced ,my wife lives the pair she received.Next pair will be a darker color.and maybe a half size larg e r. I recommend these slippers the firm soles are great for quick trips outdoors to retrieve the mail or the cat."
2,"So complete, yet incomplete","The book is a veritable flood of information, but some of the drawings are not very good, perhaps a poor job of printing? The 2 star rating is for the glaring omission of a hull stations drawing. Shocking omission, given the high level of books that the rest of the series has (and I have nearly all of them). I cannot imagine why, with all of the other information present, that the author left that out."
3,Software is disappointing,"Can't seem to keep the software working correctly no matter how many times I reinstall it. I'm on Vista, for whatever it's worth. Software communicates correctly after installing, but give it a week or so and it gets hosed up. Won't communicate with the device anymore. This has happened to me 4 or 5 times now. I finally gave up on the software. The actual battery backup seems to work fine, but it would be nice to be able to see the status in the software and set the preferences."
5,One of the best heavy rock albums ever!,"I bought this album in the early 80's on vinyl and wore it out! i even wore out the casstte too! This is a strong record from start to finish...it showcases all of Michael Schenker's talents...his lead work & his solos. Although every one of his records (even his Scorpions & UFO days) are strong releases, this is the best out of all of them. i highly recommend this for anyone who is into guitar oriented heavy rock & as the perfect album for those that are just getting into Schenker......it is a must have!"
5,Greeley never misses!,"As always, Andrew Greeley explores the complexities of human behavior and spiritual searching. Excellent book."
3,Just OK,"I hadn't tried this taco seasoning prior to purchasing in bulk and am limited in what brands I guy to do allergies. The taco seasoning is ok, but not nearly as good as McCormick. A bit disappointed to be stuck with so much of it, but will use it eventually."
4,Kirk and GP really light up the Gospel music scene,"I thought Gospel was slow and boring until I heard this. Some of the songs are slow but all have good messages. STOMP is the best and U R THE ONLY ONE is also awesome. 2 anyone that likes Gospel, buy this! Kirk Franklin is one the few Christians who can get songs played on unChristian radio stations and still put it down in Jesus name. Luv & props, Im out"
5,KIRK FRANKLIN ROCKS!,"I just would like to say that Kirk Franklin and his gang of singers are truely awesome, they have inspired me and I think they deserve everything good they receive. I love the Revolution song! and I love Stomp."
2,Older songs,"I was disappointed to find it was older songs, I was not familiar with. I would not have chosen this cd"
5,Outstanding product! Loud sound.,I bought these after having 2 separate water incidents at my home. This prompted me to try to research a way to prevent further damage. These detectors are great because they are battery powered and small enough to easily slip under the refrigerator or behind the washing machine. The 5-pack is nice as I have many locations to put it (I put one in each water heater).I highly recommend these for any homeowner.
5,Wonderful writing,"I was enchanted by O'Malley's earlier works, and she hasn't ceased to amaze me as she continues writing. This book isn't as focused as some of her earlier ones (e.g., ""Where the Rocks Float""), but the writing is terrific. Her poetry ranges from wry humor (her comments on Connemara-wannabes) to profound reflections on the human condition. The poem on the death of her son's dog brought tears to my eyes (I don't ordinarily wax sentimental over either kids or dogs, but this is way beyond sentimental!), and, as always, her language is sharp and vivid. Although the West of Ireland is the subject of many of her poems, she's not just a ""regional poet,"" and I'd like to see her become more widely known."
5,Excellent general beginners resource,"I agree with one of the other reviewers--buy this book before you buy any fish. Provides all of the basics of water changes, chemistry, fish selection and aquarium setup. Very complete in that respect. Simply and directly written. Lacks some of the in-depth detail on diseases, plants, fish species and the like, but generally with explanations as to why.Best of all, it works. I have had aquariums on and off all my life. Following the advice of this book, I have lost very few fish, have a cleaner and much more successful tank, and generally happier fish. I don't know a higher praise I can offer."
2,Not structured enough,"This book could be a good tool if it was organized a little bit. I found it difficult to locate the information I was looking for from the index. If you have the time to read it as you would a novel, you might find useful information. If, like me, you need a guide to setting up a fresh-water aquarium and some info on fish and plants, it is a little too scattered in various sections that didn't make much sense to me..."
1,Too bad about the author's ego.,"This guy is wildly irritating. He's constantly going on about his vast knowledge and how he can't explain it all to beginners but just trust him. Once or twice, okay. Three or four times, still within bounds, but this book is riddled with ""shut up and just listen to me"" advice and I'm taking it back today."
5,"great book, great info","This is wonderful book for beginners. Straight foward, no nonsense, no chemical warfare in your tank. If you are starting out get this book."
1,Super Dumb,"Now I know what I'll do when I've writen a poorly conceived story armed with dumb ideas and bad speculative sci-fi. Call it a young adult book! That way critics can't touch it. You know, because it's not for them. It's for kids!Well I'm going to say this: Don't read this book if you're expecting deep ideas and plausible sci-fi. It just isn't there.But that's ok 'cause it's for kids!"
4,"Not a bad job, Colfer","I must say, this book is pretty great. I ordered it because the cover art looked pretty odd and science-fictiony. I picked it up and...never really put it down. Though, after reading Artemis Fowl(which this book made me get),I realized this is not the best work of Colfer. Artemis Fowl had a better story line, and is all together better than the Supernaturalist. But, still, that does not mean this book is awesome. The Supernaturalist is great and I would recommend it to any Artemis Fowl fan, Science Fiction fan, or fantasy fan."
2,"Long winded and drawn out, boring and hard to get into","I was intrigued with the topic and the historical perspective of the fiction book, but it was a chore to read. I felt exhausted from the dry content and the more I read, the harder it was to maintain my interest."
4,Glad I read it!,"It looked quirky and entertaining, and besides it seemed to have some Zen stuff to it, so I bought it. I enjoyed it. Murphy isn't Hermann Hesse, and Bibi, the protagonist, is not Siddhartha, but they are brothers under the skin...think Siddhartha meets Don Quixote! But aside from the laughs and the fun of the journey, it brought me back to my center and reminded me of some central truths. I tend to think about what I'd rather be doing, rather than being what I am doing. So I came away having had a good time and perhaps a little better for it. Not a bad investment."
4,"Not Harry Potter, but enjoyable...","True, I read the publicity comparing Shadowmancer to Harry Potter, so, as a huge Harry Potter fan, decided to read it. Shadowmancer is NOT Harry Potter, but fortunately, I do not believe everything I read in reviews. Since I didn't really expect it to be the next Harry Potter, I really enjoyed it. I found the characters enjoyable and the writing to be okay. Not the best I have read, but not the worst. Yes, it is a story about the battle between good and evil and if you don't enjoy that story, you probably won't enjoy Shadowmancer. However, if you enjoy reading fantasy fiction with enjoyable, imaginative characters and DON'T expect this to be Harry Potter, you should put Shadowmancer on your list to read."
2,not recomended,"I thought I would really like this book, and I tried to like it. I usually read books straight through because I get so wrapped up in it. But I put this one down and just lost interest. It felt like a chore to finish it. I guess it just seemed boring. I did like the character of Kate, at least there was one female character in the book!!"
1,Blatant preaching sermon,"A poor excuse for a children's book. It is a blatant sermon that beats the reader over the head with Christianity. There is no real plot, story or intrigue, only a thinly veiled version of the writers belief that there is only one true religion and Christianity is it."
2,Poor character development,"No matter what some want you to believe, this book doesn't come close to the works of Rowling and Tolkien in readability, plot, and most of all character development. It might have worked had the author taken the time to paint a better picture of where and when it takes place, and given the characters much more of a history so we could get to know them and understand them. The book is very hard to get into because of these failings, and there's no real suspense or sense of awe or wonder in what occurs as the story unfolds. It could have been so much better, and I wonder if the author will make any attempt to correct these failings in the sequel or whether it will be worth reading."
2,I could write a better book,It alright but the characters are flimsy the plot is weak and totally unbelievable. Why the 1700's anyway? Im 16 and i could write a better book. In fact i think i will. Watch out for a fantasy book that will blow the socks off this folks!
1,Still Terrible,"I looked at the comments on this book only after I had bought it and read it. When I bought it, I was intrigued by the story of the self-published author who became an underground hit in England, and so decided to give it a try. If only I had checked here first.Bottom line - every one and two star review is right. Further, since I note that the most recent review is over 10 months old, I wish to emphasize that this book is still, now, terrible."
4,Matchbox vs Hot Wheels,My son received this for christmas when he was 2 1/2 years old. He's now 4 1/2 and he still enjoys it as do his friends. The parts do tend to come off but it still functions and is much more sturdy than the hot wheels sets. I would recommend this for any child who loves cars. I think the Hot Wheels sets are better for older children. I find that they are hard to put together and don't stay together for long if moved around alot.
2,Breaks easily,"I found this very easy to put together - but I did make sure I did it carefully after reading reviews.The design is poor. The crane can turn so that it is over the car lift. It'll keep the lift from going up which wears out the gears QUICKLY. This happened to ours the 2nd day we had it.My son loves it and still plays with it, but the fact I spent $30 on a toy that broke after 2 days irks me."
3,Put together correctly (clicks & all) & didn't work,"New betteries, batteries tried in another toy 1st to be sure, and definately did NOT work. My kids liked to play on the structure itself but would have definately been way better to have it do what you PAID for! I could have kept their old Little People Garage instead of ""upgrading"" to this. Very disappointing when a new toy doesn't function and it's not a fluke but a trend. Usually like Matchbox stuff."
4,Take my advice if you plan to use this with younger kids.,"My 28 month old is obsessed with Matchbox and Hot Wheels cars. He has several smaller Matchbox sets, but I thought this one looked really cool. He is younger than the recommended age, and I suggest that if you but if for a younger child, don't install all the attachments. The do come off easily, which was quite upsetting to my 2 year old. Now I let him play with it without all the extras (that do make it neat) and he has a great time. Once he gets older, we'll try again. All in all, a fun toy."
3,"Confusing, but Fun!","In this somewhat disapointing book, the JLA encounters an alien race that has been around since the Big Bang. This ancient race of beings is rapidly dying out. With no concept of the after-life, the aliens set about capturing planets from their orbit in order to find the best concept of a ""heaven"" or comparable plane of existense. Bottom Line: The JLA has to stop these beings from stealing planets but also help them construct their own version of heaven. The action gets rather boring at times, but the artwork (by artists Bryan Hitch and Paul Neary)is BEAUTIFUL!"
5,another great shire volume,"i have several of the booklets in the shire series, and all are fascinating. most of the titles i have are entirely or primarily concerned with british history.these are not heavy tomes. i think the best description is 'overview.' still, the various authors manage to included a remarkable amount of information in each volume.the information in this volume was interesting to me, even though i own many larger beading books that include history. there are many photos in this booklet, but, disappointingly, most are black and white--but they are still informative and useful for designing.i would recommend this book to beginning or advanced beaders, and to those interested in british craft and social history. this and the other titles are worth seeking out."
3,Tourmaster Denim Motorcycle Pants,"The Tourmaster/Cortech DSX denim motorcycle pants are what I was looking for to ride in the warmer weather. They are comfortable while riding since they seem to be more breathable than the padded motorcycle pants that I usually wear. Denim, though, can be really oppressive in the hot humid weather when you finally get to your destination.I find that the plastic knee protectors (which are removable) tend to bother me when walking around because the top of the protector hits the bottom of my knee cap unless I pull the pants way up around the top of my waist. In that case I take the protectors out."
2,Watch the size!,"The product is ok! although on a warm sunny day you will cook inside it, it does protect you and look cool at the same time. Watch the size, due to the cut ot the trousers the length may be tricky!"
2,But why?,"Decent production values, some fun gore, handsome guys but little beyond that. There is no background, no history, no big reveal of the killer. Without a preset motive or potential villians, it's just a bunch of pretty boys taking turns being beheaded. Whatever."
3,Surprisingly good,"Beautiful eye candy. Nice twists. Not the best acting you've seen, but keeps you on the edge of your seat. Somewhat gruesome, but again, not the grossest."
5,Overdoor Hook,Amazing! I have tried a lot of hooks in the past and none compare to this one. Currently the hook is holding 40 pairs of jeans without bending and could take on even more. Definitely buying a few more of these.
3,fine,"it does what is says, and is sturdy. I have a hard time saying much more about a simple hook, but there is nothing wrong with it. Your doors could get marked by it a bit."
1,Doesn't work,This didn't ever fully charge my LI-12B battery. I even tried to charge it for two straight days (when a regular charger would charge the battery in 3 hours) and the charger signaled it was finished but I was only able to take one picture on my camera and it shut off because the battery was not charged.
4,ANGEL FACE-SIMMONS,A very well done Noir drama.Actress Jean Simmons sizzles off the screen.Mitchum..is pure man. In black & white...the drama is very tense till the end.I do not want to give anything away on this rare GEM expect to tell you all...to purchase it & do enjoy.
2,Outdated and not very informative,"I was hoping to learn things I hadn't seen in other books, but I didn't. Not only is the book outdated, but it's also quite limited in what it offers. I was not happy with it at all."
1,very bad,"I had to order twice, and steel I am getting only 100 units. I`m trying foer third tyme to see how it goes...."
3,"Wasnt really pleased, however.......","....I listened to this book via CD and I COULDN'T STAND the guy reading it. He voiced all the characters in a monotone drab sounding voice, and made Odd Thomas sound like a complete whimp. DONT USE THIS GUY AGAIN!!! I originally gave this book 2 stars, but I figured that wasnt fair, I gave it a 3 stars on the merit, that the story was decent. I really think this guy took some of the magic of it away. I may have enjoyed it more if I read it instead of listened. One thing I have to say is..Why the he11 cant they get a woman to read women's parts!!! I hat listening to guy (with an already annoying voice) try to imitate a woman."
1,What a poor dialogue writer!,"This was my second book by Mr Koontz (one more and maybe a final chance after the horrible, unspeakably bad The Taking) and if this is one of his best, it will be my last foray into his world. Everyone is raving about this book; they may have a point; but the dialogues in this book are the worst I have come across for years. I have found one of the weakest spots of Mr. Koontz: He simply cannot make people talk The ones between two lovers are particularly bad and laughable. Come on people who on earth talks like this in real world? The plot is somehow redeeming (actually better than Taking which had no plot in the first place) but if you find the characters talking in a gibberish way as if they are maronettes this ruins everything.Mr. Koontz, my humble advice: Go read Stephen King or John Le Carre and see how characters talk in fictional world-like real. Any merit your story may have is buckled under your sophomoric mouthings.Did I say the dialogues were terrible?"
2,Too odd,It started out well but turned odder and odder with the inadequately supported events. No sex for 2 twenty year olds after 4 years. Who shot the sheriff. What is with the bodach and what purpose did they serve.
5,"Odd Thomas, the odd, AWESOME one.","Odd Thomas is one of the funniest, most interesting and loveable characters I have ever read. After reading this series (well, I still have to read Odd Hours), I wouldn't mind reading every Koontz book I can get my hands on. This book just keeps you entranced. I read Odd Thomas over the course of a few days all while visiting some friends and being very active. You will not want to put this book down. The relationship Stormy and Odd have could make anyone jealous. You would think that seeing dead people has been overdone, but Koontz handles the plotline with an ease of genius. Once you read this book, you will definitely want to read more about this awesome guy, Odd Thomas. I, like others, found myself laughing out loud numerous times while reading this. Excellent read. I feel it'll be a while until a character beats out Odd Thomas as my favorite book character. Get this book. You will absolutely be delighted with it."
4,Wish the ending had been different,"This was one of Koontz's better novels. It was hard to put down, I liked the odd but intriguing characters and the plot. I just wish the ending was a little happier."
3,Well written but with several flaws,"""Odd Thomas"" is very well written. Koontz's language is beautiful as always, but the story leaves something to be desired. Overall, the story is a good one, but it takes much too long before it gets really interesting or suspenseful. And when the suspense comes, it doesn't last long. At times it's also repetitive; the reader is told things that's already been told.I can only give the book three stars and I'm not sure I'll care to read the sequels."
4,"Quicky paced plot, Solid charcterization, and a touch of the Odd","The title of this review says it all; if you want some interesting characters that are a little unusual and likeable, Odd thomas is your book. Koontz hits a Homerun here; the story is definitely Odd but Great and everything ties in nicely that your sad when its over. Enjoy this story on any Sunday."
4,A really good book,"I just happened to pick up this book by chance in an airport. I was really pleasantly surprised. I couldn't put it down. Excellent story with quirky, intelligent characters. Great story. You've got to love Odd Thomas. I have gone on to read the next two novels in the series and they are just as good."
5,Gripping and Heart Wrenching.,"The book starts out with a young 20 year old man telling a little about himself. He is going to tell you a story about something dramatic that happened. A story that will grip your heart. As you read the book, you will find out that he is connected with the dead. He can see them. This isn't some phoney childrens thrill-story. You will fall in love with the characters. As this young man works to save his small town, you will learn his secret and grow close to him. His love for Stormie will capture you. By the time I finished, I was crying like a baby. This story was incredibly vivid. I felt as if I belonged there. There are so many surprises you can barely handle them. Truly an amazing piece."
4,My first Dean Koontz novel.,"This was the first time I read anything by Dean Koontz. I decided to try it when I heard about it from others and saw people reading it by the pool this summer. I am very glad I tried it. Odd Thomas is a very likeable character, very young and not quite sure what he will do with his life. He is also psychic, which is the driving force behind the plot. Besides Odd Thomas there is a whole town full of wonderful, well written characters that really make this novel come alive. Once I began reading I did not want to stop. I found myself reading during every spare moment just to find out what would happen next.I liked this book very much and am happy to recommend it."
2,Boring,Too much filler in between the narrative of the story. Odd Thomas is an interesting character over run by too much unnecessaryfiller.
4,very kooky :),This book has just the right balance between the dark dead-type things and the other aspects of the novel. I'm really pleased with it. It's probably one of the best books I've read in a while
2,Odd but not very interesting,"I've read most of Dean's novels, and his newer releases seem to be waning. ""Odd Thomas"" is no exception; the most significant shortcoming about this novel is that it never seemed to go anywhere. And, I didn't find the characters as real/descriptive as in his other novels.Also, I didn't know I'd be reading the pseudo-script to the film ""The Sixth Sense"" (Bruce Willis). I enjoyed the movie but wasn't interested in reading a novel about it."
5,Audiobook,The excellence of this work from Koontz goes without my saying. definitely in my top 5 favorites list of books. on the audiobook version the price is a steal for this audiobook version. David Aaron Baker narrates Koontz vision perfectly.
2,Dean has lost most of his touch,"I have been reading Dean Koontz novels for more than twenty years. Over time he has changed his ""style"" to become more preachy, to demonize anyone form of belief other than what he believes, and his stories have become weaker, less original, and tedious.He has gone from being one of my favorite writers when I wanted something to read just for fun to a mere shadow of himself. I have an ackward relationship with him. One one hand he is like an old best friend who I relied on for many years. On the other hand he is now like that same friend but who is going down the tubes yet who I keep hoping will come out of his free fall. I sometimes still read him because I keep wishing to find the same spark he used to inspire yet at the same time I try to avoid much of his stuff because I had to see how far he has fallen. Like Stephen King, maybe its time Dean considers retiring."
4,Odd Is Good,I like most of Koontz's earlier works but didn't like his recent ones. Namely Sieze the Night and Fear Nothing. I had thought Koontz had run out of ideas when I came across Odd Thomas. The plot isn't much but it's Koontz writing that really shines. He has taken the idea of The Sixth Sense movie and given it a real good spin.
2,"Pretty good, but wordy and drawn out.","How many times can you describe a scene in a book. Well, Dean Koontz manages to describe things in a million different ways describing almost every scene. It's actually too much! I couldn't wait until he would get to the point. Plus there were alot of details about characters that you could care less about. I was always waiting till the author would get back onto the good stuff. The real suspense stuff instead of boring us with useless details that were not interesting.My favorite of Dean's is ""The Taking""."
2,What brought about this change?,"I, like many others who have written these reviews, would really like to get back to the old types of writings we came to love from Mr Koontz. The characters and stories are still good, but not near as intriguing as before. I really liked the way he wrote before, combining the barely possible like subliminal messages with the really outrageous. His characters also were always very colorful and memorable. Now it seems they're much more mundane. I also, like others, keep thinking I'll give up on this author but have grown up with his works, so I keep trying one more, hoping it will be like the REAL Dean Koontz books we've all grown to love over the years."
2,Not as good as I hoped,"I read this book on a lark. To be fair I have read Dean Koontz before, and never really appreciated his style. But I heard so many good things about Odd Thomas, that I decided to give it a try. I was a little intrigued at the beginning of the book, but as it went on, it only disappointed me. The oddities about the main character felt like a crutch for the author to move the story where he wanted it to be. None of the characters felt believable. I was surprised partway through to realize that the main character was supposed to be 20 years old - his voice sounded like he was 40. The events go hurtling on toward nothing surprising, a little happy and mostly sad, but everything as it is to be expected. I feel like the last 10 chapters were just a given - there was no point to read them because you already know how they go. I like the ""idea"" of Odd Thomas. I just feel like Dean Koontz could have done a lot more with that idea."
5,A good combination of The Medium and The Sixth Sense.,I would have liked a different ending. Book is very well written. It starts with a bang and ends with a bang. I recommend it and look forward to reading the next book in the series.
2,Major audio problems on Texican,"Buyer beware on this video, the spoken audio track does not always match up well with the video. In fact, some of the voices used do not ever seem to be from the actor in the movie. Parts of the movie feel a poorly dubbed Godzilla movie. The picture quality of the movie is fair to good (but could be a lot better). As an Audie Murphy fan, I could not find this movie anywhere else so I had to get it."
2,Audie Murphy does Italian western.,Poor video quality & english dubbed on most of the actors. Typical sound effects as in all Italian westerns. Pass on this movie. I am a fan of Audie Murphy [ life and movies] but this movie stinks
4,Interesting and Informative reading.,I am very into the X-10 gadgets and have been for several years. This book was intended for the average homeowner interested in inexpensive home security. The only thing it lacks is diagrams and layouts for the systems it covered.
4,Grab bag of advanced topics,"This book covers a grab bag of topics around the .NET platform. Topics range in obscurity from reflection (which it starts with) to just above basic, using ADO.NET with stored procedures. Threading, which is always a difficult topic to explain, was covered in a well written fashion, but lacked illustrations, which I think would have brought a lot of clarity to the subject. Other topics were given some illustrations, but overall the book used screenshots for most of the graphics. Remoting was another area that could have used illustrations.Overall well written, but could have been better organized and illustrated. Definitely worth a look over if you find that it covers topics of interest."
3,Dry.,"How can a century of violence come across like reading some horrible bureaucratic list of names and dates? I don't know, but they did it.I'd read ""The Gulag Archipelago"" by Solzhenitsyn and cried through the whole thing. I was looking for a book that, without the drama and human story, would detail the decisions made and factors considered by Soviet leaders as they embarked on their murderous course. I thought this sounded like just the thing.Instead, I could barely read a sentence without falling asleep. Names! Of people, organizations, departments. Histories of the people, organizations, departments. I would strain to try to keep them all ordered in my poor brain, thinking maybe they would be important later. Alas, no.I still haven't found the type of book I'm looking for, one that presents important information in an interesting way. I know! I am so shallow. And maybe just not as smart as all the other reviewers. Oh well.Yakovlev seems like an incredible person. But the book, not so much."
4,Great! Gets old fast thought.,"I agree with all of you people that think it gets old fast. You listen to it only a few times and then get sick of it. I suggest that when you get sick of it, don't listen to it for a while then play it again. You won't be sick of it and you'll like it. Overall it's a good c.d."
4,pretty good but gets old,"I really liked this cd when I got it but it got really old after about 3 months, I don't listen to it much because the songs are too short and I don't like short songs but I do listen to it when ever I have the need for something pretty much entertaining. over all it is a pretty good album though"
5,dude dont forget the old smash mouth they rocked,Smash mouth used to be such a good band.My friends make fun of me because i listine to them but they havent heard this cd pure gold. They should bring back their ska/punk rock style back. If u like this cd DONT BUY SMASH MOUTH THE CD & GET THE PICTURE they arre big big big big big disapointments. But do buy Eastbay sessions and astro lounge great cds.By the way most people consider smash mouth a alternitive rock band i agree.
1,Not Very Good......,"I thought Walking On The Sun was cool so I borrowed it from a friend.Turns out it wasn't very good.Most people bought this CD so they could hear that song plus Why Can't We Be Friends and I Can't Get Enough of You. Many were dissapointed that the last wasn't on it.Instead, a bunch of noise was in it's place.The Fonz is a very rude and profane song that glorifies rape and other violence against women.Complete with endless profanity and has a gross ending.Steve Harwell doesn't sing very well.Nervous In The Alley is a disguisting song about oral and anal sex.That too has endless profanity.I don't think I'll get Astro Lounge.Besides, Allstar sucks."
4,Solid Unexpected Ska,"Nearly everyone in the world knows All-Star by now,but does anyone realize that Smash Mouth was originally ska.This is a great album exept Walkin on The Sun, which later caused them to sell out.My favorites are The Fonz and Nervous in the Alley.The Fonz was released as a single but didn't get much airplay.Nervous in the Alley's first inpression is a pop/punk song at the beginning but then it cruises into hardcore!I say any punk or ska fan should check this one out."
4,Man vs. Nature - Worth finding out who wins,"John McPhee tells the story of three massive efforts to control nature's power. From the volcanic ash and lava flows in Iceland to the mighty Mississippi to the huge flows of mud, rock and ash into the Los Angeles Basin from the surrounding mountains, man's heroic efforts to live where nature did not intend us to live make a fascinating tale. McPhee's narrative has enough detail to provide the reader with a full appreciation of the forces at play and the perseverance of the men and organizations charged with ""controlling"" their impact. A great read."
1,This oven gets too HOT stay away! no joke!,"We have had B&D ovens for years and bought this one to replace the B&D Dine-in Model that we loved. This oven gets so hot on the handle and on the outside I can't believe it is on the market. Today I burnt my finger on the handle. DO NOT BUY THIS OVEN. Aside from that it is difficult to use as you have to set the temp,then time, then hit start all before the oven thinks you have changed your mind and shuts down. I regret buying this oven."
3,Controls freaked out,"We bought this item in a brick and motor store. It has performed well until today, when, it would not shut off. It gets stuck in bagel mode and then continuously runs. This is a gigantic safety hazard.My wife had to unplug the unit to get it to turn off.B&D; is sending us a new unit and I will update this post after we receive."
3,NOT IN GOOD CONDITION,Because the item was not in a very good condition. It looks like refurbished with a lot of scratches inside-out. Item does not look like brand new from manufacturer.
4,Black & Decker Toaster Oven Model CT06301,"Really like this toaster. Wish the digital display was brighter, but not a big problem. This is my second one. The lower heating element on the first one quit working. Probably because I used it so much. Almost never use the stove oven since getting this one."
3,A good toaster oven but could be better,"This convection toaster oven would get five stars but for two shortcomings. One: unless you're in a very well lit kitchen the LCD display, which is NOT backlit, is almost impossible to read. Since getting it to do what you want is not as intuitive as it could be it's imperative that the display is legible so you can see where you're at in the programming steps. Two: the toasting times are fixed, i.e. 1, 2, 3, etc. These are not minutes, just numbers. And even though it toasts evenly it takes much longer than our old toaster oven.The convection oven works just fine. And you really do have to lower the cooking temperature by 25 degrees when using the convection mode. Don't ask how I know."
2,Arrived dented,the oven works just fine but I was highly disappointed when it arrived with dents on the top of it. I had opted to buy from amazon because I have a free prime account and the price was a few dollars cheaper than the one I found at Target buuuut now I wish I had purchased it from the store cuz I could have checked the contents before i was stuck with it. shipping it back would have just cost that much more. Go to Target or some other place to buy this item to ensure you don't get a damaged shipment.
3,"So close, but yet so far.","Why any company would make a product that forgets your custom settings when the power goes out... is a mystery to me. This oven does run a bit hot as some reviewers have noted, but if you can't use a toaster oven without burning yourself, you probably shouldn't be using one at all."
2,wrong measurements,Web description measurements not accurate not 17 3/4 but in actuality it is 19 and 1/4. I bought it for a particular space and it does not fit so I am returning it. Did not plug in the ovenBlack & Decker CTO6301 Digital Advantage Stainless-Steel 6-Slice Convection Toaster Oven
2,Nurse Edith deserved better treatment,"Produced the year WW2 began in Europe (1939),Heroic examples were certainly needed.My interest in the film was not with Nurse Edith or Dame Anna Neagle who played her; it was the sublime Edna May Oliver who I wanted to see. I've suffered thru Shirley Temple and bad hollywood Shakespeare to enjoy a few screen moments with this towering and sardonic figure. She seldom disappoints. There simply isn't enough of her."
2,"Okay. For this genre, it's a waste.","The songs ""Pollution"", ""Counterfeit"", ""Stuck"", and the cover of George Michael's ""Faith"" are the only good songs on the album. The rest of the songs are a big waste of music. I'm not saying I completely hate the album, it's just that I don't listen to many of the songs on the c.d. Alot of people will like it though."
5,the arrival of a major talent,"With his debut novel, BETWEEN DANCES, Erasmo Guerra establishes himself as one of the most promising young novelists around. Guerra writes beautifully and with an impressive maturity. This is the beginning of a brilliant career. BETWEEN DANCES is powerful, and it rings true."
3,The Firm CD is all good. One Love Nas Good Luck.,"Nas is one of the best rappers of all time's other then the late BIG. He's dropping his new album on the 30th of the month trust me when I say your gonna be sucking him too. He much more better on the solo tip, and he's a positive brother, in today society thats what we need."
2,DO NOT BUY!,this cd is complete rubbish. It is not for you hip hop fans but purley hardcore rap. although it stars some famous rappers such as dr.dre and nas escobar this album is a complete waste of money and will probably interest harcore fans slightly.
4,Nas and Dre on a whole album - Very good,Dre's album after DeathRow and before signing Em. Nature replaces Cormega on this. This album is pretty good. I don't know why it did'nt catch.Top Joints:Firm Fiasco (Tight)Phone Tap (Classic)Executive DecisionFirm Family (Smooth)Firm All StarsF*** Somebody Else (Foxy demanding Pleasure)Five Minutes To Flush (Nature Shines)Firm Biz (Something for the Radio)I'm Leaving (Nore rips)Throw Your Guns (AZ Gets off) Hot Joint
3,More Potential Than Performance,"Nas, AZ, Dre, and Nature could have put it down, but didn't. It bombed compaired to previous albums by them. Some of the Nas lyrics were on fire, but overall it was just okay. Foxy is just plain wack. She shouldn't have been on this album."
3,Could have been better,Was not that hot foxy could have found something more to talk about and for god sake get ride of those green nails
1,Not impressed...,"I appreciate the attention to detail this brand has, but in my opinion, they look better in the picture."
3,BlueJay54 on Blaise Pascal ??? Please,"Bluejay54 You Had Me interested at the beginning with your comments. You sounded reasonably intelligent until I came to your comment:Mind you, one should not expect to learn this from a Christian writer and a Christian publishing house, but Pascal's natal astrology chart clearly illustrates the problems and paradoxes that he faced in life: Venus in Cancer squaring the Moon's Nodes and opposing Mars in Capricorn, with healing Chiron in Taurus, and a Stellium (Jupiter conjunct Saturn conjunct Uranus) in Leo. No wonder Pascal felt so torn by fame-and-fortune seeking of his keen mind, yet was irresistibly drawn to a fiery fundamentalism and an ascetic life-style!Christianity, Pascal--NO God Himself--can't be Viewed, Explained, argued Logically, or Intelligently from ""ASTROLOGICAL"" Premises.I did however find your comments, amusing, and commical."
1,the worse,"I did put my order 3OCT12 is now 5 Nov 12 and still dont have my book which I purchase due to the need of school, Im now in the middle of the semester and still dont have my tools for my class trust me this is the last time I trust your store and by the way as soon as I get your product it will get ship back to you faster than it was send to me. you suck."
2,Hit or Miss,"I'm a big fan of Esham but this album was disappointing. He delivers with his usual gritty lyrics with skill and most songs on the album were solid to great lyrical performances, but the beats ruined the sound for me. Listen to this album if you want some original, gruff Esham street stories, but don't plan on being blown away by the beats behind it. Overall, worth a look, but only if you're into his music. Key Tracks - 'Turbulence' and 'Bolivia'."
5,Terrific series,"Billy And Blaze: A Boy And His HorseMy 4 year old boy and I really enjoy the adventures had by this boy and his horse. The old fashioned black and white or sepia drawings are well done and fit the ""old west"" theme. Some stories have a slight hint at danger, but everything works out. There is a forest fire, a mountain lion, a wild horse. Billy is a problem solver. So far we have read 6 books in this series they are all very good. We recommend them."
4,"Gorgeous Pictures, Not-So-Great Writing Quality","Fun books for their illustrations and not their writing quality, the Billy and Blaze series were always at the top of my list growing up. This book was one of my favorites, dripping with adventure and exploration.Although poorly written, the Billy and Blaze series was fascinating to me as a girl and fed my imagination. Any young horse lovers will eat up the vivid black and white drawings that tell the quaint stories much more eloquently than the rather dry words.To read more of my children's book reviews, visit larsenreviews.org."
5,Wonderful!,"You do not have to like football to call this a favorite! This movie beautifully shows how God will take the heartaches and dissappointments in life and turn them for good, because He Loves Us. No matter how big or small, the movie brings home this; God is interested in Every aspect of our lives; this is Definatly a favorite!"
5,Facing the Giants: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack,"Thanks for your shipping and handling of this content. I love this movie, but the true is I have no clue about this sport. I believe anyone should see this movie, I know that this has been seen by a different coach I've met. So yes this is worth it to buying this film."
1,Never receive Audio CD Facing The Giants - ASIN: B000TTEUIA,"I love the movie 'facing the giant' ever since I bought it from the local bookstore. My kids love the soundtrack and that motivate me to purchase it from Amazon.com. However to my surprise I received the DVD movie instead of the CD soundtrack (Never receive Audio CD - ASIN: B000TTEUIA) that I thought it would be. Now I have 2nos DVD movie of FTG and what do I do with it? I give it to a friend as a gift which is not a bad idea at all since he love the movie too. So in as much as I would love to give my review, I can't do it if I do not have it or experience it. Anyway thanks for the invitation."
4,Some good 20's pop singing...,"Vaughn DeLeath was a popular vocalist during the late 20's. A very popular radio star, who was definately under the influence of Annette Hanshaw(a superior jazz singer from the same era) however she is limited in her style by also being influenced by Al Jolson, therefor there are plenty of sappy overly dramatic ballads, and vaudevillian style singing, at times almost operetic, though not bad for a singer in the pre Crosby & Armstrong 20's. Try Annette Hanshaw if you want pure jazz singing in the 20's."
5,The best one for me,"I have looked through other raw food books, and this one was the best for me, a beginner. I like that this book includes a raw foods encyclopedia, which helps me understand more about what these raw foods will do for me, good and bad. Unlike the other raw foods book I have, this book provides research based information, and not just from other raw food books. I guess it doesn't hurt that Brigitte is an herbalist who knows about plants and loves them too. Although I don't agree with 100% of what she says (such as her opinion that a raw foods diet costs less than a cooked diet), I appreciate the helpful information she is sharing with readers. Also, I like that her recipes are simple, as I have been intimidated by complex recipes from other raw food books. I wish I had purchased this book first. Then I wouldn't have spent money on the other one."
2,A disappointment from a favorite author,"Margaret Atwood is a cut above the rest. ""The Handmaid's Tale"" and ""Alias Grace"" were unique and gripping works of fiction with characteristic traces of Atwood's element of science fiction/fantasy. This book, however, was very disappointing. It ambled on and on, and although Atwood shows off her exceptional talent through a diverse range of character portrayal, the plot left much to be desired. Don't bother."
2,Definitely not her best,"I found this book to be bogged down in details and lacking in movement. The characters are too quirky and overstyled to feel real. Overall, the book seems self-indulgent and therefore does not speak to the reader. It has nice moments, but feels more like an exercise in writing rather than a piece that comes from the heart."
5,Simply Outstanding (and I'm a man),"If there is one book that will convince you that you will never be able to write a novel, then I'm afraid this is it. The characters are well developed and the prose exemplory. Ms Atwood gets into the minds of her characters better than any other author I have ever read. And how very dark and frightening it all is. Not for the fainthearted."
4,You won't be able to put this one down!,"This is the third Margaret Atwood book that I've read and, once again, Atwood fails to disappoint. Much like The Handmaid's Tale and The Blind Assassin, I simply could not put The Robber Bride down once I started reading it. The story of these four women is engaging, and is so multi-faceted that any reader would be able to relate.The main flaw, as some other reviewers have previously noted, is that the characters seem all too stereotypical, and thus a little unreal. Charis is the delussioned hippie, Tony is the academic and Roz the busy career-woman. Perhaps Atwood selected these personas to show the universality of Zenia's ""wrath"" but each character seems to fit their respective stereotype to a T.All in all though, this is an excellent book and well worth reading. Pass it on to your friends!"
3,"Kept my attention, yet confusing","I really got caught up in this novel. It held my attention but I found it confusing, how it jumped from Roz's current life to Tony's past. The Zenia character was never really explained as to why she was the way she is. But it was a good book and the location (Toronto) made it seem even more real because I've been there"
1,A complete waste of time,"The story of Zenia, a character with no redeeming qualities and her impact on three women. Only you never find out anything about Zenia. And Roz, Tony and Charis are not people I cared very much about. I think there characters were pretty well defined, but I kept wondering about the men in their lives and what these women saw in them, and what Zenia wanted with them. When I got to the end all I thought was is that it? I felt like I had wasted a week of my life."
2,dr blaine's scar care gel,I didn't care for it. The edges got stuck to everything my wrist came in contact with. Was very hard to cut stips to fit spots that I needed.
1,No good!,This is the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon. The gel pad is awful to use. It falls off sometime. Gets dirty. Takes a long time to dry. I would not recommend this product.
2,The Secret Agent on Flight 101,I am Vignesh Nathan. I did not really like this book because it was confusing . I know it is about a magician named Hexton who used to be a theif but is now a magician and he kidnaps the Hardy boys dad and they go through adventures with thier friend to catch the bad magician.
1,"Horrible Book, I wouldn't get if I was paid ( )",Bad book. This book is really confusing. Gave it to a friend to read. He didn't get past the 1st chapter. This is the worst book in the series. Out of about 90 Hardy Boys i've read this is the worst.
5,Very Pleasant Surprise,"I was initially skeptical of this book (having first read it around the time of the collapse of the USSR; it seemed too far fetched) but it did not take long to warm up to the premises, the events and the author's take on various political/military developments.Though not a literary masterpiece, it is a great example of its genre, and I haven't encountered any books of this size that I was able to finish reading in 11 days (a personal record!)Now, if only Hollywood were to option the rights..."
2,This,"I got this toy from my Grampy a few years ago and it was fun for a while, but you look totally cheesy and it's too bulky.The back is too hard to unscrew, and you almost break the plastic trying to open it. The headband is too flimsy, and when you move, it falls off. The little lights come on when you pull the goggles on, and you still can't see a whole lot. it broke soon after I got it, The lights wouldn't work, and you can't open the light thingy to put new ones in. The only reason I said educational is because the best thing you can do with it is read.[...]"
4,cool night vision,"The light is extremely bright and hurts your eyes a little if the child wearing them looks right at you. However, my 8yr old loves these. I assume they dont hurt him because I have removed them from his head several times when he has fallen asleep with them on at night. For spying?? Well maybe not because the light is bright but my son cant wait until summer time to use these outside at night. For his purposes (whatever that may be) he just thinks these glasses are really cool, look cool, lights up well, he is overall happy with them and so am I. We have some of the other wild planet gagets and this one is one of the best in quality."
1,Could be alot better!,"I would think that out of all the toys spygear or wildplanet have created, I'd think that they would havecreated something productive...Not two flashlights ""built-in"" to a pair of green-lensed goggles. They're fun for dress up or household use, though."
4,Fun Googles,"I ordered this item for my Nephew's Birthday. He really likes this item as does his younger brother. They like playing spys and ""Spiderman"" with this fun Goggles set."
1,[...] they HURT to wear - and serve no purpose,"The heading above pretty much sums it up. My eight-year-old couldn't wear these for more than a few minutes without the pain caused by the poor design and the strap mounted battery forcing him to take them off. The ""sleek"" design was apparently tested without an actual kid. I even called the company and they admitted that they had no kids even available to test their toys on.Amazingly bad. Save your money and buy them a book instead."
5,Very Good Item.,"This Hand Truck has 800 pound capacity.The D handle and big air filled tires make pulling up staircases much easier and less traumatic to the load.Tool Fetch had my product delivered from Ohio to Detroit,overnight.I didn't even pay extra."
1,These guys are terrible at getting your product to you.,"Read their 5% dissatisfaction comments.No handtruck yet. This is my seventh review update... I payed almost $20 to ship a $40 product.I guess I should have questioned it from the start! When the ""supplier"" found I had wrote a review he sent me an email. Not to say my shipment was on the way or to atleast tell me why I hadn't recieved it. He asked me to remove my post and gave instructions on how to do so.....more to come!They did not offer tracking information,DON'T EVER ORDER ANYTHING ONLINE THAT CAN'T BE TRACKED. Still hasn't arrived 11/8/11 and shipper still haven't located or sent another one."
3,A mixed bag...,"Yes, unlike similar compilations by Midway, Taito, etc, most of these games are remakes, and a bit challenging (I couldn't get used to the ""new"" Golden Axe, for starters). However, both Virtua Racing and OutRun seem to have made it relatively unchanged (though there must have been licensing issues over OR, since the familiar Ferrari has been replaced by a larger car that looks out of place, IMO), as did Space Harrier, so that's a redeeming factor. My take? If you like the new and different, it's worth picking up, but if you're looking for actual arcade ports, better try some other compilation."
2,Screw threads are not precise enough,"This item is very cheap. It works fine on some of my stuff. BUT it won't thread into my Olympus m4/3 kit lens (14-42mm version II). It jams, and won't thread. It is not safe to force it as that ultra-lightweight lens has a plastic thread (which fits other items fine, so it's not the lens' fault).I suggest a better-made product for best results."
3,Ring threads are way too short,"The step up ring seems to be constructed well, but the threading that screws onto the camera is VERY short. Because of this, a slight bump to the lens can cause the threading to pull off the camera, and strip the threads on your camera.... potentially very bad. I've had the lens get bumped off of the threads a few times, and the threads are still OK, but another one or two ""rings"" of thread to screw on more and get a tighter fit would be good"
5,exquisite pop record,"I just discovered this record recently and i can't believe what i've been missing. this is a beautiful, moving record by a major artist deserving of much greater attention. every song is a good one, but ""Nothing Good"" and ""Strawberry Blonde"" are perfect pop songs. the comparisons to elvis costello are obvious but sexsmith sings much more naturally and beautifully. he achieves a rare combination of sounding relaxed and yet using very nuanced phrasing and care. and like costello, he has the knack for the great opening line that draws you immediately into the song (""She's not the girl next door, but the girl who lives 'round the corner...""). produced by mitchell froom and featuring an all-star band of fine players, More Songs is a must have for those who love quality pop music."
3,Read Editorial Review first,"I didn't buy this book because I read the editorial review first - seeing that it said ""patterns from the archives..."".It's a nice idea and some people actually want a bound collection of past patterns some don't."
4,a very Good Artist,"Bobby Darin had a cool vibe about His Music Presentation. He truly was able to blend styles&Yet Maintain what He was doing.""Mack the Knife"" is still my cut by Him.""Moon River"" sounds Good here as well. He was a really Good Entertainer&I Look forward to the film coming soon."
3,Bread & water when you're used to a banquet,"In comparison to the rest of the Eve Dallas books, I found CEREMONY to be strictly filler material. Not only wasn't there much of a mystery going on, but there wasn't much development of the Dallas/Roarke relationship. While all the characters followed true to form, I didn't feel there was any growth. Despite this, CEREMONY presents a few hints of things to come. I hope the next ""in Death"" novel continues the excellent standards set by the first four."
5,Evil is alive & well in the the future.....,"Ah, this book brought out the Celtic in me, also Roarke showed His Celtic/Irish roots a little more fully. Officer Peabody has turned into a real asset & a down right interesting person. Much more of her background was reveled, she is a perfect foil for Eve's intense nature. I'm still so enjoying the play between Eve & Roarke,,, sexy, witty interesting couple. Wonderful fast paced, didn't see the end coming at all!"
5,Good Reading,Love all J. D. Robb books keep you guessing all the time. Can't put the book down once you read the first chapter.
3,A weak link in the series,"This is a fantastic series with a great blend of suspense, romance and just a sprinkle of sci-fi. ""Ceremony in Death"" is a disappointment, however, when compared with the other books in the series. It's really heavy on the cult and lacking the page-turning who-done-it suspense so characteristic in Robb's other novels. You do learn more about Peobody, however, and the humorous banter between her an Eve (as well as Eve and Roarke) make it worth the read.If you are disappointed with this book don't give up on the series. The next book, ""Vengeance in Death"", is the best one yet!"
3,Ceremony In Death by J.D.Robb,"This paperback was shipped with four other books, was bent in half from slippage in shipment evidently, making the book hard to read as it's been impossible for me to 'unbend' the book to a reading position. The other books were in good conditon. I will still use this company as often as I can."
5,A Fiendish plot,"Boris has created an intriguing and unique character without overly plundering the homage to a classic genre. The plot is truly fiendish and the atmosphere of late nineteenth century Russia feels authentic and rich. There is a huge nod to James Bond here, more so than the Sherlock Holmes you would expect. His other books are good but not as good as this first one."
3,"Kudos for atmosphere and authenticity, but....","plot? Missing in action!This is really more of an action thriller than a true mystery, as other reviewers have noted. The hero's survival is astonishing and the motivations of the players are explained, if at all, only briefly. The language is elegant and much attention has been paid to the details of the period -- one assumes a faithful translation. I understand that the puzzling title is NOT original to the Russian version, so beware of reading too much into that in trying to piece together the plot lines.Given the quality of the writing, I'll try the second book in the series and hope that the plotting improves."
4,A Darn Good Read,"You can't go wrong reading this wonderful mystery set in turn-og-the-century Russia. The central characters are appropriately endearing, devious, or mysterious, while the plot twists and surprises in just the right places. Recommended!"
2,Synthethic beats unappealing,"At first listen this Plug CD had some good qualities, but that fades quickly.IF you're a fan of hard hitting Drum n Bass, don't bother with this one. Some Dillinja or Dieselboy will suit you much better."
4,Great for the money,"Mine arrived in black, but that is fine. The scope was bought for a replacement tube. I already have a go to tripod. The optics are very good for the price. The whole assembly is less expensive than any stand alone tube I could find, and it comes with two eyepieces and a Barlow. Not a super scope, but it is a super deal."
2,Too many negatives,"While the optics of this scope are good, there are quite a few bad things about this telescope. The tripod is shaky, unstable and cheaply produced. The finder scope is flimsy and almost unusable.The users manual that comes with this scope is not written for beginners. Important topics such as balancing the telescope, polar alignment and collimation (aligning the mirrors) are glossed over and totally unsuitable for a beginner.I would recommend spending the extra money to buy an Orion Spaceprobe 3 or SPaceprobe 130."
4,15 year old telescope,I bought this as a gift for my 15 year old daughter. She loves it. We have only used it once due to bad weather and a bad cold we are sharing. Its relatively easy to assemble. It's our first telescope and I recommend it for the younger beginner. You get a lot features for the price. Critical reviews I've read don't comprehend the low price you pay for what you get.
4,A Good Telescope,Itis a wonderful product with minimum cost. I have tried to and have been able to see some spot in the Moon.Good product.
2,A Sub-par Three Soldiers,"Mailer's take on war, is just a weak ""Three Soldiers"" which was written by a much better writer: Dos Passos.Pass on ""The Naked and the Dead"",pick up the real deal: ""Three Soldiers""."
1,"Could not finish , was tricked by Larry McMurtry's review","I ordered this on the recommendation of a reviewer of a Cokie Roberts book. Since I liked that book, I was tricked into buying this one. The story was slow, and the cowboys were really boring. Several times the writer simply describes male characters as ""Type A"" without providing any description of any aggressive tendencies. Why didn't the editor catch these cliches? (Oh, yes! it looks like it was self-published) The female lead was a prosaic doll that never came to life.After giving it a heroic try for 2 hours, I skipped to the end just to say I finished it, but I didn't pass it on to friends. Tossed in recycle bin."
2,Designs are.... Yucky,"I was looking for some good samples of Celtic Cross Stitch designs. And all I can say is... I didn't find them here. I didn't care for the designs, and the book is really skimpy - they re-use a lot of the same designs with various simple adjustments to make up for the lack of variety. I would NOT recommend this book at all for anyone who wants to do a Celtic project."
5,Not just a book about Japan...,"William R. LaFleur gives us a book which is well made. Piece by piece Mr. LaFleur goes over the history of abortion, buddhism, family planning, sexuality attitudes and even woman's lib in Japan. By the time he reaches his conclusion, you can't help but feel like you, yourself, have also researched and processed all the information.Near the end, when he compares the Japanese ideas to American ideas on the issue, you can't help but feel that maybe it was all a well placed trap, to get you to look at the whole mess from a different point of view, not just the pro-life/pro-choice, good/bad, yes/no, on/off American way (where every issue only has two sides and the winner gets total victory, so no mercy!)You might not like some of the points made, but it will sure force you to think."
3,Didnt like it,"I have to be honest i didnt like the book at all.I bought this book because i have read the ""Autobiography of a Yogi"" and really loved it... and i also loved the teachings of his master Sri Yukteswar, thats how i came to this book.This book wasnt what i was expecting...i was expecting some kind of teachings, but instead this is a book that talks about the things in common between Hindu & Christian scriptures."
3,The scottish had a part too.,"This book is a lot about Scotland and there influence, and how the scots managed to do so much to help create the modern world."
3,Great Discussion Book for Book Clubs,"More about the Scots than most would ever want to know...Jewels of wisdom and insight, many in number, are contained herein, but finding them, at times, can be a difficult read...at other times, a thoroughly delighful read. One wonders if the author is not ""reaching"" at times, but the provocative thoughts make great discussion topics....This is an excellent book for book clubs, especially men's book clubs, evoking many different views and reactions on a number of important and timely topics. Just how much does the Modern World owe the Scots? More than you might think."
5,EYE OPENING BOOK ABOUT SCOTS CONTRIBUTIONS,THIS IS A AMAZING DESCRIPTION OF THE SUBTLE CONTRIBUTIONS BY SO MANY SCOTS THAT HAVE ENRICHED SO MANY SCIENTIFIC AND CULTURAL AREAS. SUPERIOR EDUCATION SEEM ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS. LIVELY WRITING ADDS TO THE ENJOYMENT.
4,Scotland Forever!,"What a warm and revealing book. For so many of us in America of Scot descent, too many of us had no idea of the importance of this poor and ignored nation that produced such a revolution of new ideas in law, philosophy, government, economics, education, and religion that are with us today and taken for granted. Scotland overcame every adversity and stands proud today as a grand part of our heritage."
5,"Poignant, Humorous, Entertaining, Educational","A real life story about an exceptional man and leader. Easy to read and enjoy, this book takes you on one man's poignant journey through life and a Marine Corps career. I found the leadership lessons inspiring!"
2,a pile of contradictins,"Hugo is a navel-gazing, sex-obsessed anti hero. To say he's an epicure is a contradiction, because we all know smoking deadens the taste buds. His boozy, smoky self-destructive path is predictable, and he revels in it. Wish I hadn't bothered wit this book."
3,"Not bad, except for ending","To sum it up, Steph was given the raw end of the deal when it came to being Robin.Seriously, I think many of these hacks that get hired to be editors of comic companies have issues with women, relationships, people who could accomplish what they couldn't in their wildest dreams, or all of the above.The end of Steph being Robin, along with the end of War Games, is pretty much what led me to stop reading DC for the longest time (I already stoped with Marvel after that Sins Past garbage)."
5,Posthumously Published,"Probably my favorite Hemingway, this book, perhaps better then any of the others, has a protaganist who is most like what Ernest was and wished to be at the same time. Or maybe that is just my romantic perspective. A great read, and a highly satisfying book on whatever level you care to place it on."
1,FLIM-FLAM.,"Of the few dozen books I have read on the subject of real estate investing, this is perhaps the least desirable. This book rates high on incredible hype and low on any real substance. The author skips from one incredible deal to the next, showing how yes, you, your neighbor, or even the village idiot can make millions of dollars with virtually no risk, no expertise, and of course, no instruction on his part. As another reviewer stated, I always finish a book to search for those ""pearls of wisdom"" as well as to give an acurate review of the book as a whole. I found no pearls here.If you want a good book on real estate, try Robert Allen or Wade Cook. If you want something to wrap fish in, buy this book."
5,""" FEELING OLD GOSPEL SONGS""","THANK YOU AMAZON, FOR ANOTHER GOSPEL DVD WITH DOROTHY NORWOOD WHO ONCE SANG WITH SHIRLEY CAESAR, ALBERTINA WALKER/CARAVANS. THIS DVD MAKES YOU FEEL UP LIFTED IF YOU ARE FEELING DOWN,DEPRESSED, JUST LISTEN TO 'SOMEBODY PRAYED FOR ME"" AND THE POWERFUL ""OH WHAT A FRIEND WE HAVE IN JESUS"". I KNOW I ONLY MENTIONED TWO SONGS,BUT THE ENTIRE GOSPEL DVD ,IS FOR YOU IF YOU ""ENJOY"" OLD SCHOOL GOSPEL SONGS SANG AS THEY SHOULD BE BY DOROTHY NORWOOD. ""YES I DO RECOMMEND THIS DVD."
5,A one-book bible for the writer of memoir or fiction.,"Rainer has done a terrific job of making the structure of the scene comprehensible and do-able, and that's applicable to fiction or nonfiction. She also gives help in figuring out just what it is you want to say. One smart lady."
4,"Good for explanation, not the best story",Thsi book is basically to fill in the holes in the whole Gorn mythos. The huge reptiles that never quite played well enough on TV to be spotlighted before. Its a reasonably good story but nto anything to write home about.
5,My daughters loved it as a gift.,I gave one to each daughter for Valentines Day. My daughters loved it as a gift.
4,Good read about an unknown guerilla war,"In reading ""Behind the Burma Road"" I learned about a guerilla war that was waged behind the Japanese lines during the Burma Campaign in World War II. I have read other books such as ""The Maurauders"" by Charlton Ogburn, ""Burma Rifles"" by Frank Bonham and ""Galahad"" by Colonel OSborne which have had mentions of the Office of Strategic Services and their Detachment 101. In this book you get the first hand knowledge of the former commander. Great read!"
2,Not What I Expected,"Thought this would be a fun- always been a fan of Sonic and my 6 year old loves him. This ""collection"" doesnt even allow you to play all the games listed. The graphis are awful compared to Crash Bandicoot, Star Wars and Cars for the same system. Maybe because it was meant for Sega? I dont know- but dont waste your money."
3,Its pretty brown,"While this album does contain a couple of my all time favorite Primus songs, most of it lacks the intensity and catchy originality of the Primus of the past. I love the chugging beat and subtle weavings of ""Restin' Bones"" and ""Puddin' Tain"" and the totally insane, drive it in your brain songs ""Camel Back Cinema"" and ""Duchess and the Proverbial Mind Spread"", the clean, bare bones bass lick on ""Chastising of a Renegade"" and the rolling show off song for Les ""Arnie"". However, for some reason the main songs dont really do much for me. It seems I would have to agree with the less enthusiastic of Primus fans on this one. Guitarist Ler is strangely absent, Mr. Les' bass sounds a little flatter on this one, and Brain, the new drummer, does a decent job, but nothing special."
5,"Jimmy Reed, his greatest hits",It was fantastic to get this CD. I have all of Jimmy Reeds LP's with no way to play them. I did notice that the drum beats in the beginning of Honest I do were cut off but all in all it is a great CD if you are as much of a fan as I am.
3,Not The Same,"When I was a kid/teen, all the adults just loved this man, so I bought the CD thinking he was ""all that"", but it turns out he is not, or maybe I have outgrown him, or my taste in music has changed, or something like that. He's in my collection now, but just for old time sake, with fond memories."
5,Ben's 100 is great,"Submitting the order was easy. Paying with credit card was easy. Product arrived on time. Application of product was easy (pump spray); very little was required to keep the bugs away. Even though it's only 1.25 ounces, it'll last a long time because it's so concentrated."
3,"forging birth certif, makes this guy look amateur!","Never heard any inkling of this history and found it hard to believe given how fact based films lack funding, hence, assumed they overplayed the evil aspect.... Vincent perfectly cast and oh how so many women can relate to the ""I got duped but I still love 'em"" script... Glad to now see a woman in charge of the state and fighting to maintain fiscal strength... Wanted to know more bout that book and surprised they didn't expose more elements but crafty, conniving, cheat was covered enough in character development... sympathized with the gypped landowners and pleased their OccupyArizona met with success!!! bravo"
1,Dissapointing,"I had read about Ringworld for many years before I finally picked up a copy through Amazon. I eagerly awaited it, and thought of terms like 'majestic' and 'awe-inspiring' which I would apply to it when finished.Now I have the book Im not sure I CAN finish. While the idea of a 'Ringworld' is fascinating, Larry Niven fails to deliver any of this interest. His characters are rather tired, and lame, and boring. His writing is slow, lacking in detail where it matters, overly detaile din other parts, and always boring.It must be kep in mind that by the time I started this, I had just finished Orson Scott Card's superlative 'Ender Saga' - so perhaps I expected too much, by expecting someone to write with Orson's brilliance.Perhaps not. I do not recommend this book."
3,Ringworld Blahs,"I liked the book...honestly, I did. Yet, I find myslef not really all that impressed. The power of the story lies in the ideas it conveys. The Ring itself overshadows the characters in the novel. I really didn't care about any of them except for Speaker. They were simple vehicles to get me into the ring so I could explore the unique idea Niven presents. It is truly a classic, but were it written today in 2003, I doubt it would capture the Hugo or Nebula. I give homage to the ideas presented but find a lot of the book honestly flat. The setting so overpowered the characters that the find myself remembering the ""look"" of the world more than the ""problems"" of the characters. All in all, I am gald I read it but will probably never re-read it."
3,Generally known as a classic.....,"....but not to me. I dig Niven b/c he uses a lot of ""hard"" sci-fi and there's plenty evident here; however, it definitely helps to be familiar w/the species of the characters before undertaking this book. (Check out some of Niven's ""Known Space"" novels and short stories.) The sheer number of species introduced can make your head spin, and the journey *to* the Ringworld seemed more exciting than the voyage *on* it. Intriguing indeed were the discussions of the RW's possible origins and dimensions, but these, to me, were few and far between."
4,A book that stays interesting after many years,"For me, one of the marks of a truly great book is whether I can go back and re-read it again and have just as much fun as the first time, maybe because I discover new things, new hints in the plots, new twists in the character development which I missed the first time.Ringworld is jsut such a book, a classic that whistands the test of time well. It tells the story of a group of humans and aliens who crash land on a huge artificial construct built around a distant sun. After the crush, they must explore the huge structure in order to find the means to allow their crippled starship to take them back to their own worlds.It was quite facinating, following the characters in their struggles in the immense artificial world they found themselves on. This is truly a scifi classic recommended to any who is interested in good old solid sience fiction."
4,"Give Him a Try, Larry Niven","This was my first look into Larry Niven's work! Ifound 'Ringworld' interesting but confusing. Thecharacters have complex personalities and the relationships alter all the time. My confusion deals with the Ringworld itself, I think I need the next book to understand what, where and why it is. In many instances this book made me think of another piece of fiction 'The Hab Theory.'"
3,"I am not a big hard sci-fi fan, but found this series interesting.","I got this book because I liked the concept of making a planet as a strip of land wrapped around a star with tall tall walls to keep in the atmosphere. I did find it interesting enough to read the entire series. Also a cool idea to have someone genetically bread to be lucky (random lottery draw for couples to be allowed an extra child, then that child wins the lottery and gets permission for an extra child, than that child grows up.... until the 6th generation lottery child gets picked to go on the expedition to the ring world). Great book for hard sci-fi fans, ok for other sci-fi fans, definitely not a good idea for anyone else."
4,"Stunning concept, brilliant ideas, flawed execution.","I read this book when it was first published, again about 10 years later, and once again recently. In all that time, my impression of it has not changed. I have been a science fiction addict all my life, and a fan of nearly everything Niven has done. But not this. While it contains interesting characters and some strikingly original ideas, it suffers from the same disease as Tom Clancy's more recent novels: it drags. God, how it drags. Finishing it was a major chore, all three times. Like Clancy's recent work, this would be twice the novel if it were half as long."
3,The Bulworth soundtrack was not all I expected.,"Bulworth, the soundtrack, was OK. There's a couple of songs I really like, and some that are orite. This CD is average."
5,Not just a one song cd,"Yo! I just went in my room and checked. There are exactly 14 songs on this here cd and their all tight as sht! And whenever I pop it in I ususally skip over ghetto supastar for Canibus' ""How Come"" or ""The Chase"" by the RZA, and all the other good tracks. This is probably the best hip hop soundtrack ever made!"
1,Completely Predictable & Poorly Written,"I had the opportunity to explore this title via audiocassette on a recent weekend drive. After several hours, in spite of valiant attempts to like this work, I gave up. Driving in silence seemed a great relief. I found the stories to be highly predictable in their plot and outcome. The characters and plot lines were poorly developed and fragmentary. Adding to the agony was a narrator who's vocal talents were highly limited. Attempts to mimic accents or speech impediments resulted in nearly unintelligible results, adding ""insult to injury"". The juvenile nature of this work along with the poor narration results in an unacceptably poor overall experience. While the written version of this work may alleviate the limitations of the narrator, I remain highly doubtful that attempts to slog one's way through these unremittingly (and VERY predictably) dark and poorly written works would be worth the time investment."
5,Miracle at Midnight,"Each year, my fifth graders read the novel, Number the Stars. Because they don't know a lot about WWII, we watch this movie to provide some historical background to the novel. My students love it - it gives them an idea about that time in history."
1,"Low-quality, expensive, not Cappuccino","1. The item is not ""Cappuccino"" colored, it is black!2. Some of the ""N"" 3x10m/m 20pcs screws go right through the plastic item ""J"" while they are supposed to hold them fastened to the board. Either the screw heads are too small or the hole in the plastic is too big. I had to go to my hardware store and buy my own screws with slightly wider heads.3. The overall quality of the shoe rack is very poor for the price."
1,Incredibly confusing,"Urgent: before you order this, you need to read my experience with this item:Amazon REALLY REALLY needs to change this item's picture because the actual ""I carry you"" piece is a Bible-quoting poem. I am incredibly disappointed because it has been the second time they sent me this. I had to resent the first one, replace for a new one and it's still NOT what I wanted. And they don't even let me refund it. I have to replace it."
5,Powerful!,"This is not just a musical, it is an ""experience"" in the truest sense of the word. If you are familiar with Blackaby's study, Experiencing God, this cd is a must. If you are not familiar with the original study, this cd is still a must. It is fresh and timeless. Each time I listen to it, I'm drawn in. Great music, powerful message."
5,DKM - one of SF's greats.,"This book and the others in Daniel Keys Moran's backlist are some of my favorite cyberpunkish sort of works. Honestly, I consider him to be one of SF's handful of situations where you have an amazing author who winds up terribly underpublished.Buy Emerald Eyes first, then Long Run and the rest. Now. You will love every minute."
5,Serger video,I was afraid of my serger until I bought this video. It has very clear and detailed instructions. Now I can thread and use my serger to its full potential. I highly recommend this video if you are new to serging.
5,My 4 year old is thrilled....,"Great watch for a small child. The fact that it came with the pouch and compass made it a good value. My 4 year old is happy and it's still ticking, so what's there to complain about? Nothing!"
1,Unreliable,"Less than a year old, one output to speakers failed in mid-gig. Got a Y-connector (speakers are mono). Second output failed in middle of next gig. Furious."
1,no different than other cheaper products,"I am a frequent handwasher, which dries out my hands & cuticles. I've tried many products and because of a recommendation, I thought I'd try the SpaRitual product. This product is NOT worth the extra money and after using for 2 weeks, there is simply no difference than what you can purchase at your local drug store. So, save your money!"
1,Aversion therapy,"If you like aversion therapy, you will probably like this CD. I do not like aversion therapy, so I did not like this CD. The narrator has a very pleasant voice, and the music by C. B. Burston is excellent."
2,Not suitable for a wallet,This chain is tiny. I needed a chain for my wallet but this is too small. Maybe I can hang some tampons from it.
3,Not Bad,"These aren't bad, but are made of very thin cotton with a very thin drawstring and they don't seem very ""maternity"" like. The drawstring is a downer, since it has no elastic it tends to tighten. They don't feel very roomy, and the quality of the material is so so."
1,Ask a crisis counselor what they think of the beginning pages of this book.,"This book is irresponsible. A major assertion in the opening pages could prevent a suicidal kid from seeking help. The premise of the first section is that for a teen to tell their troubles to a friend or anyone else is the same as ""barfing on your friends"". As crisis center and peer counselors know, many teens hold their most disturbing thoughts and emotions to themselves, and in all too many that leads to suicide attempts or successful suicides. Any useful ideas the author may have expressed in the rest of the book are more than negated by this poorly thought out advice. Please Amazon.com, withdraw this item from sale to impressionable teenagers looking for advice in their troubled lives."
4,Excellent product and delivery,This is a must have resource for anyone wanting to know what goes on underneath the covers. It is well written and has examples to reference.
2,"Useful, but Too many Mistales","I tested many code and contents of this book and discovered many misunderstandings and erros.While reading and testing, I'd got doubtful of the reliability of this book.This book provides many useful information, but don't swallow whatever this book says."
2,"Ok, but code is poorly designed","The book had some interesting topics, but a big part of a book like this is being able to experiment with the programs especially when it is based on yet another class library from the author. Several of the examples don't run or compile. Others link to versions of the SDK headers that are not present with the default installation for VC. The writing style is clean but the source code examples are not as interesting as they are advertised."
1,save your money,"Purchased this toy for my four year olds birthday and he wasso excited. Unfortunately when he would hit the cans they rarelyever fail over. When they did fall over and we had to reset them they would not stay up. The balls if stepped on get squished easily. He no longer plays with it out of frustration, and neither does my six year old."
1,jvl,"this game does not play on xbox 360, dont buy unless you intend to play on orig. xbox. there is no update on xbox live. to bad ilove this game."
3,It has its uses,"If you're new to Barbershop, this is a decent intro. You get some good tunes by some good groups, including the gals (a few Sweet Adeline groups).If you're already into Barbershop, you'll probably be disappointed. The mix is too eclectic; there are too many so-so cuts; and on top of it, the production of the CD is suspect (a couple of the tracks are so close together you barely have time to breath).A well-chosen half-dozen CDs, each done by a different group, would be a better way to start a Barbershop collection. Too bad Amazon doesn't carry much of this stuff....<P"
4,Easy to Use,This book is very helpful and easy to follow. It's a very nice book for anyone trying to figure out Fireworks!
2,Poor Quality,The DVD skipped the first time I played it and got progressivly worse. Other products via Amazon have all been fine; I'm hoping this is just a fluke.
1,Let Down Part Two!,"This much like Sailing The Sea Of Cheese was a bug let down even though I wasnt expectng much from either album! Once Again the only thing that shines is Les Claypools bass playing! And its good, oh is it ever good, but out of the 15 songs 2 are good. The first good song being track 1 and the only reason it is good is because it is total silence! the second being 'My Name Is Mud' that is actualy really a pretty good song, but other then that this album lacks everything a good, no make that everything a decent album needs! This band had no writing skill, no arangment skill, the only skill it had was to play the bass! Dont waste your money on this junk!!!"
4,"""Tunes"" well for our 8 (eight) and 10 (ten) year olds@#$%&*","If a CD cover can help younger folks listen and by listening they learn to discern desiring the ""audible"" from the start, then buy it! ***Terrific value that can only be had for Jeff B.'s Amazon. Customer service is the best. Suggestion: Purchase an extra one and give away!"
5,Mr. Ed,It is an entertaining and wonderful series. Just as wonderful as the previous series. A great way to spend the afternoon watching
5,I'm so glad I finally sprung for this box set!,"I do so miss Watterson's comics. I had been delaying on this one because of the price, but I'm glad I finally ponied up. I have always respected Watterson's decision to end the strip rather than watch his work be distorted by commercialization, but from a selfish point of view, I would have liked one or two more years of the strip.I especially enjoyed Watterson's essay at the beginning of book 1. It offered interesting insights as to who he is, how the strip came to be, and why he felt it was time to say farewell to C & H.I'll be delving through these precious books for years to come."
4,Packaging wasn't the best,"The product was wonderful; it was everything he ever dreamed it would be. However, it came with a dent in one of the corners which fortunately didn't damage the books, only the collector's box that they come in. Packaging during shipping could have been better. Other than that they are WONDERFUL!"
4,Lovin da C&H,"I was quite pleased with this set. The books are very nice, the printing is good and of course its quite fun to read. My only problem was the box it came in had a bit of a problem with some of the cover peeling a bit. Other than that its a great set and I'm glad I got it! Great gift idea."
2,Packaging,"The packaging could have been better. I ordered this for a friend, but the corners of were dented on arrival."
3,Excellent then fill,"There were good days and then bad days.....Snowman the best....Otherdays...You just go ""Huh?"""
4,Awesome must have collection,"Great collection of work. I especially love the history of how it was created. It does fit awfully tight into the cover, but otherwise, and absolutely great purchase!!!"
5,Creativity at its best,"Indeed, a must-have for anyone who enjoys the true art that can be found on comic strips. Calvin ""Boy of Destiny"" and tuna-loving Hobbes at its best in this unabridged collection. This package even includes the poems, short stories and quite a personal introduction by Bill Watterson. It comes in a three beautiful printed volume with strong binding made to last a lifetime. This Horrendous Comic Kablooie deserves it's place up there with such characters as Mafalda and Bugs Bunny."
1,"Creepy, mean ""hero"" humiliates and rapes the heroine on her wedding night","Well, this is the first romance novel I've read where the hero is just a horrible person. After kidnapping her he brings her to his home and continually humiliates her, setting food down and telling her to eat like a dog, he gives her disgusting chores like cleaning up after the dogs but gives her no tools so she is doing it with her hands ( gee-great romantic visual there), he allows men in his clan to nearly drown her in the frigid loch, and another time throw her against the wall causing her to become unconscious, he makes her wear a revealing outfit and watches her serve his friends who nearly rape her in the main hall during supper, but then announces, hands-off I've decided she is my lady-wife. The wedding night is special--he rapes her, then is surprised she is a virgin as he always thought she was a whore. This is not my idea of a romance novel. I wish I had my money back."
1,"Fell hook, line and sinker for this stinker!","Boy, did I get taken in by the other reviews of this book! The characters are predictable as is the story. There were so many inconsistancies - this book went right into my re-sale box after about 50 pages. If I could've given it a half-star I would."
1,HORRIBLE IN EVERY WAY,"I don't write reviews very often, but I had to for this book. Please believe me everyone, I don't know how it's possible that there are any great reviews on this book???????????? The writing is very amaturish - about what my middle school kids could do. How could this book even get published? Don't waste your money or time. I have read hundreds and hundreds of romance novels and this was one of only 2 or 3 that I couldn't finish. It was a long book, which is normally a plus in my opinion, because you can really get a good, full story. In this case, I just don't know where the story was going to possibly go after reading about 1/2 of it. I couldn't bring myself to find out though. It really just didn't matter. Thank God I didn't buy the whole trilogy."
1,"Poor black imaging, paper jams, try Dell 1320c","I bought this printer because I was tired of replacing injet cartridges and waiting for injet printouts. The small size of the printer for a color laser was very attractive. The printer, however, is fatally flawed. The black image quality is quite poor and at times unreadable, but we lived with it for most schoolwork. (The color was OK). The printer is very finnicky about the paper. Some types will always jam. Other types will jam frequently. So after about a year, I have given up on this printer. After some research, I purchased a Dell 1320c. After about a week, I am quite happy with this printer. It is larger, but the black and color print is better and so far no paper jams!. It also costs a bit less as well."
1,Great idea. Lousy quality.,"Purchased this laser printer for small office applications. Right out of the box had to return the first one. No good. Second one behaved better but was still flawed. Front panel wouldn't close properly. Had to tape it shut in order for the printer to work. Kept it anyway because it only cost about $100. Printer lasted about two years without problems (but keep in mind, it was used very little). Crapped out a few days after extended warranty expired. Now needs a new fuser unit. Fuser unit costs more than the printer itself. My printer is now a boat anchor. Oh well, the idea of an inexpensive color laser printer was great in theory, but the true quality of this printer is garbage. Not what I expected from Samsung. I will say it printed nice color and gave me semi-professional printing results. It's just that it's a piece of garbage and I can guarantee you the printer won't last long. They truly are disposable printers."
2,Not reliable,"Pro: cheap, bought at Fry's Electronics for <$100Con: not reliable, expensive toner, changed toner once then printer broken.broken for printed 1000 pages, then the overall cost per page = $200 (printer & toner)/1000 = 20 cents per page"
2,Bit the dust too early. Mediocre when working.,"I was looking for an easy to use and maintain basic color printer. This printer gives a mediocre image quality, but is probably pretty comparable to the other printers in it's price range. The problem is that you have to perform maintenance too often, almost every time you want to print. Do yourself the favor and just get a basic ink jet. The advantages of a laser printer are not present in this unit.Addendum - After only a year and a half, this printer has crapped out on me. Fail. Do yourself a favor and get a canon."
1,KAPUTT AFTER ONE YEAR OF DOMESTIC USE.,"The advertisements described this printer as ""robust"". I had one for one and half year and it had to go 5 times to the repair shop to be fixed with serious problems and actually it went completelly kaputt, without any possibilities of repair."
1,avoid,junk. Enough said. If no stars was an option that is what I would have chosen. After hours on the phone I finally returned it and bought a HP.
2,I didn't expect much and this product delivered just that,"I knew going in that I couldn't expect such a low-priced printer to deliver great results . . . and it doesn't. I would describe its text print quality as poor and its image print quality as below average. My experience has been that text on the left and right sides of a page are fine but the center of the page is faded and the characters are not fully formed. Photographic images are not very good; however, vector images are just fine. The killer for me was attempting to navigate the Samsung online repair website. I say ""attempted"" because I was unable to complete a repair request, ending up in a never-ending circle. I literally spent over an hour and never made it past step three of five! After this experience I have decided to abandon Samsung. Thankfully, the printer is very inexpensive so I won't lose too much sleep after I replace it with a better model next week."
2,Low cost low quality,"I have had CLP300 for 5 months now. It basically worked OK for children's school projects.I noticed a few problems with it:1. When I turn it on, the entire house light start blinking; do not know if it uses too much current2. The drum area is VERY hot and give burning smell. It stays hot even after idle for a long time3. The color tone are off a lot. It simply prints very saturated colors far off from the original pictures. I was using the original toner."
5,Direct Replacement OEM,This was a OEM replacement. Not much to say it just replaced the worn out part and fixed the noise with the heating system.
3,"tragic is good,but could have been better","this is the first live concert, for the califormia band, that showcases thier talent from thier first and second abulm of hits.while the performance is good, the langaguage that lead singer, gwen stenfani uses could have been taken out.but is still evident nonetheless,baiscally it kinda ruined my enjoyment. as for the concert is it very good,some great ballads, rockers, its amazing. as of this writing, thier are plans for this to be on dvd is a limited box set, and in november of this year 2003, a live rock steady concert video. which any no doubt should love."
5,NO DOUBT fans must have!,"If you love No Doubt, or Tragic Kingdom then you must own this video! Awesome old skool No Doubt music, and if you've never been to a No DOubt concert, then this video will give you a preview of them: THEY KICK A**!!!!!!!! Gwen has soooo much energy that you just wish you could be there in the concert with them. :-D"
5,Gift for my nephew,This was shipped promptly and arrived in time for my nephews birthday. My sister gave me a list of books he would like and the duck series was among his new favorites.
2,Not impressed.,"I'm not one of those reviewers who seem to get a sick joy out of bashing totally harmless books, but I'm voting against this one. I like a poet who can turn a phrase that makes me wonder how they got there. I enjoy poetry that engages my emotions and my aesthetic sensibilities. I had high hopes for this book and I was disappointed on every page.What was so disappointing was that Georgiou managed to cover many emotional subjects (eating disorders, race, domestic abuse) without engaging my emotions once--or even offering an interesting perspective. She seems to be following in the footsteps of second-wave feminist poets who have covered similar ground, but much more effectively. The themes of Georgiou's work could be directly out of anything by Adrienne Rich or Marilyn Hacker but without the prosodic savvy or rich metaphors of either.This book was marketed on is ""sexiness,"" and I guess it has its sexy moments, but all in all, it's pretty lackluster stuff."
3,Product photo needs updating,"Not being a fan of silicone basting brushes I ordered this item b/c the picture shows one with natural bristles. Instead I got exactly what I was trying to avoid, SILICONE! Otherwise the quality of the tools and case seem very good. Had I known the brush was silicone I likely would not have made this purchase and would have continued my search. I would've given this item 5 stars if I received exactly what I thought I ordered."
4,Very good!!,"I enjoy the sound of this band.Admire Linda Perry as a brilliant singer and song writer.For me, it's a good cd. And I think it's a pity that the band only recorded one cd."
4,Great CD,"This CD is unique and very different, but still has a lot of the same traditional rock. There is something lacking in it and I can't pinpoint it exactly but it's still a good CD. The best part of it is the lyrics. They are well written and well sung. All in all, good CD BEST SONG: Dear Mr. President"
3,Another Vividly Real Streep Performance,"Based on a true story about a newly-single mother who talks her way into a job teaching violin to grade schoolers in a tough Harlem neighborhood. Doesn't exactly cover new ground, but Meryl Streep is extremely likeable in the lead role and it's always entertaining."
4,Absolutely Heartwarming!,"Music of the Heart is just what the title says. Meryl Streep is wonderful as the teacher who wants to make a difference in childrens' lives. The children are wonderful actors and actresses, and the story is quite touching. The story just builds and builds, and the ending to me was the high point of the whole story--when the novice violinists played with the real famous violinists. It sent chills through my spine. I highly recommend this movie for anyone who wants some good entertainment."
2,Scratchy,"It's cut fine, but the material is scratchy and would probably grab a lot of lint. Perhaps, a really good wash and fabric softener would help, but I didn't want to risk it and make it non-returnable. I returned it right away."
1,Stained,One pair of pants had an ink stain on the back of the leg. I didn't notice it until after I had put them through the wash so I could not return themVery disappointed!
4,Lee's Jeans,"I found this product to be of good quality.Glad that I was able to purchase a proper waist size, I feel thatthe consumer has been forced to buy pants and other clothing thatdo not fit properly due to sizing such as 34-36 waist, when they needan 35 waist to fit properly.I was not able to get the length needed due to 30,32,34 of which Ineed a 31 length.But, product is of good quality, I wish we could go back to the oldand proper ways of sizing that fit."
4,Just what I wanted,"I got these Khakis on sale for $20 and they compare with others I've had for $40. The side pockets caress my wrists strangely, but nothing falls out, even when I'm hanging from the roof of my cave."
4,"Well made, comfortable","These pants were several inches too long, but probably I ordered the wrong size; they required cutting and hemming.Fabric is smooth, comfortable and strong. Seams are well stitched and finished. Waistband is the right size. My husband is very pleased with these pants. Would order them again (shorter). Double check the length before you order."
1,Young Adult? Yeah Right. How 'bout Rated X?,"I cannot believe this book is in the YA section of the library. My son picked it off the shelf - I thought it looked interesting (we are not hardcore Christians or religious in any way). I'm just amazed that it's for teens. I think it's trash - I mean, seriously... Domination, Masochism, Rape? For kids?????? To find this stuff in the YA section is just...PATHETIC. How 'bout in an ""Adult Bookstore"" right next to all the other porn?"
4,STILL GOING STRONG,"I've been a Nighingale's fan since Julius Cheeks was there. But, I still miss Charles Johnson singing with them. He would have made it 5+ stars."
1,Borrows extensively from more in depth books about Walker,"This paperback biography by Cookie Lommel is part of a series that generally relies on secondary sources and contains some errors. Much of it appears to borrow extensively from a more thorough, primary source biography written by A'Lelia Bundles, Madam Walker's great-great-granddaughter, in 1991 for Chelsea House."
3,Competent translation --incompetent editor (1/2),"This volume includesThe Birth of TragedyThe Dionysian World ViewOn Truth and Lying in the Supra-Moral SenseRonald Speirs' translation is very good and about everything one expects from an institution such as Cambridge. Raymond Geuss' introduction is: unsympathetic, condescending, spurious and trite with biographical snippets excepting. Skip the introduction to this text."
5,Love this product,"This coffee maker is attractive, efficient and makes great coffee.This is our third Brewstation and the best one yet."
1,Coffee tastes awful!!!,I had better tasting coffee from my little cheapo 4-cup Mr. Coffee drip machine. Instant tastes better than what I get from this machine.
1,LEAKS!!! After 1 year.,I loved this coffee maker up until a week ago. After about a year the tank started leaking. There is a gasket under the metal warming plate and it suddenly started leaking. Coffee EVERYWHERE. I called Hamilton Beach and was told that it is a gasket and it will leak after a period of time. I understand that after products breakdown after a period of time but ONE YEAR???? If you buy this coffee maker be sure you keep in in a bucket to catch the coffee that is bound to start leaking everywhere.
2,not worth it,i got this for my shotgun and it never came with of the adjustment straps so i sent it back for a replacement and it doesn't come with a adjust strap
2,Look Elsewhere,"One of the most important things you can do in a presentation is open with something that gets your audience's attention. This book does just the opposite. The autor talks about himself and how successful he has been, then launches into a loooooooooooooooooong fictional story of a day in the life of a Starbucks barista and how every interaction is a presentation. Is this book only about making that point? I must admit I only got about 25% of the way thru, but it was so clearly not what I was hoping I put it down."
1,overpriced,"I had high hopes for More Milk Plus since it contained a blend of herbs. I thought it would work better than fenugreek alone or a nursing tea. This was not the case. I think More Milk Plus is overpriced. I got better results from either fenugreek alone (2-3 caps 3 times a day) or Yogi Nursing Mother's tea (3 cups a day). And they are cheaper. I will not repurchase More Milk Plus. After talking to other nursing mom's in a local breastfeeding group we have come to the conclusion that More Milk Plus works better for skinny moms that weigh less than 150lbs. For those of us who weigh more, and thus take the higher does, we did not see the results."
2,Didn't do much for me...,"These vegetarian capsules didn't do much for increasing my milk supply. I kept track of how much I pumped before and after, and my supply actually dropped after stopping taking Mother's Milk tea and trying these instead. When I use both products, my supply goes back up again, but not nearly to a level close to satisfying my baby's needs. However, if I don't take as many of these capsules or drink the tea as often each day, my small supply goes right down, so this product does do something to help at least. It's very subtle though for me. I have a 4 mo old son."
2,I do NOT recommend this book,"The women in this book are, for the most part, lifeless mannequins. In general, I didn't find the women to be photographed in a way that was either erotically attractive, or artistically attractive."
3,"Nice, but no cigar","If it weren't known that the author was so young, I wonder how much play this book would have received. It is a nice story with some good punchy repartee here and there. But in the end it is just a peppy, seen it/done it story about a bunch of kids goofing off and having adventures. It is not profound and it is not timeless. Save that kind of praise for the great modern coming of age novels-- CATCHER IN THE RYE, GOOD TIMES, BAD TIMES, THE CAR THIEF."
1,Not a Good Move for Bush,"I would have to be one of the most loyal BUSH fans in the US, but even I was disapointed with ""Deconstructed."" Past Bush songs contained the angry lyrics, sultry guitar melodies, and overall hard-rock flavor that has made BUSH into a success. ON ""dECONSTRUCTED,"" the tracks are nothing but electronica-like beats that seem to drag on forever. Every song (with the exception of the single ""mouth"") is just a headache-inducing mix of blips and beeps. In my opinion, BUSH should stick to what they're good at (making actual music), and forget about joining the fadish electonica wave. Two words for people looking for classic BUSH flavor on this album: think again!"
5,Delicious!,"This tea is really, really delicious! It smells and tastes like melted cinnamon hearts. It's definitely something we will buy again when we've used up this box."
4,Intense cinnamon flavor!.,"Harney & Sons makes the best cinnamon tea - ever. If you're looking for a warm, intense, cinnamon flavored black tea - look no farther. However, for the most intense cinnamon flavor, I suggest the silk bags or the loose tea (a plus of buying those is they usually come in a nice tin). The bags from this box were made of paper, and the cinnamon wasn't quite as intense. I have read other reviews (on the Harney site) that say the same thing. This had a nice price, however, and I still recommend it."
5,A black-and-white South African Romeo & Juliet novel,"Instant in the Wind is one of the most beautiful love stories I have read. After an exploring team is killed in the jungle, a slave on the run is forced to accompany a surviving white woman and together they travel across the desert. During their long walk throughout the country, their relationship evolves. As they learn about each other, we discover all the details of life in South Africa in the 18th century. Brink's writing is at its most powerful, poetic, so moving in describing this heartbreaking love story. A masterpiece of literature."
2,"The Music Is Great - But ""best of??"" I Think Not","If you sift through the Sil Austin CDs available you will quickly see that there isn't one among them that presents the three hit singles he had for Mercury from 1956 to 1959, never mind their B-sides. Even this one, labelled ""Best Of,"" fails to deliver, although it does include a version of his June 1959 # 59 Hot 100 hit Danny Boy.Nowhere to be found, however, is the B-side, The Hungry Eye (Mercury 71442), nor are his ""best"" hit, Slow Walk, a # 3 R&B;/# 17 Top 100 in late 1956 on Mercury 70963 and its flipside, Wildwood, and the February 1957 # 74 Birthday Party on Mercury 71027 and its B-side, The Last Time.Finding all six original sides in one volume in CD format is impossible.And, as much as I love the tenor sax of Sil Austin (who once was featured in the Tiny Bradshaw band), I would not recommend paying the current used price shown as long as there are other options far less expensive."
5,Essential NIN,"Despite it being a six(eight)-track EP, Broken is without a doubt as essential as any of NIN's full length albums and is an important part in the musical evolution of nine inch nails. Some of Trent Reznor's finest compositions are on this release, including ""Happiness In Slavery"", ""Wish"", and ""Gave Up"". This may well be NIN's loudest, most guitar-driven album, full of hysterical noise and scathing, angry lyrics. It paves the way for the even more abrasive ""The Downward Spiral""."
3,Standing Next To The Grand Spiral,"The only reason I chose not to rate this any higher is simply because Reznor has come out with albums at least two stars better than this -namely The Downward Spiral and The Fragile. Standing next to these albums this EP can only earnestly reach as far as three, maybe four, stars. At no point is Broken disappointing but also at no point is it as majestic as the forementioned albums. Definitely a strong footnote in the scheme of all things Nine Inch Nails. However I personally overlook Broken when I think about or want to listen to a good Nine Inch Nails record. The reason being I find myself only listening to the best of what particular bands produce and there's so much great music out there. But if you have a profound appreciation for NIN then pick this up; it's certainly a tenacious escort to their fame."
5,Trent rocks!,"I love this record!!!! Broken is probably the most aggressive NIN album yet made...verry hard hitting angry industrial metal. As always the music is amazing, verry well composed, NIN truly is an exceptional artist."
5,The soundtrack to your nervous breakdown,"""Broken"" is such a primal musical experience. Everything about it is loud, raw and the guitar work is explosive. I love the way Trent uses hip-hop rhythms as a backdrop for anger and noise. When I feel disgruntled or disillusioned about the world in general, ""Wish"" is my theme song for those feelings. And even when I'm in an up mood, listening to ""Broken"" is still a cathartic, energetic experience. And I think the fact that it's an EP instead of a full-length CD allows Trent to maintain the urgency from beginning to end; it's more of a shock to the system than say, ""Pretty Hate Machine"" (which is more of a techno-dance album to me anyway). No doubt, ""Broken"" raises the roof."
5,Intense and Very Good,"I really like this album. It really is great. I like it because it isn't poppy like their last album. It has anger and really good lyrics, but the music is great too. It is short and is really stays with you long after you listen to it. Oh, and another thing, hearing this CD is one thing, but seeing the movie that was set to it is really what makes it worth it. While the movie wasn't ever relesed because of graphic violence, it is available through bootleg. I have a copy and it is really cool, but gross and very intense. Anyway, get this cd and if you have the guts, get the movie!"
4,"not their best, but NIN will always be the god of industrial","Released after (as far as i'm concerned) their best album ""Pretty Hate Machine"" this album takes a much different approach. ""Pretty..."" has angsty/mellow/powerful music and lyrics, whereas ""Broken"" is much more of a 'f*** you, f*** life, and f*** everything else' album. It is great release from a bad day, and ""help me i'm in hell"" is a nice calming effect in the middle of all the rage. A definate must have for all Nine Inch Nails fans!"
4,Step Up From PHM.,"After their debut was released in '89, they made a comeback in the early '90s. It's an EP with 6 full length tracks and 2 instrumentals. The songs are a lot better than any off Pretty Hate Machine and it's when they turn from '80s electronic/techno to industrial and hard rock. It's not real mature lyrically or musically but it's a step and it's a sign of things to come. The songs are way heavier than on their debut and Broken still is their only truly metal album to date. Wish, Physical and Gave Up are my favorites and stand out the most. Rest of the CD is also very enjoyable though. Broken is only the beginning and The Downward Spiral comes 2 years later."
5,Classic NIN!,"Broken was the forshadowing of things to come. An instant classic with pure raw angst and anhedonia within, contradicting itself. Pure listening pleasure!"
4,Light Weight,"This book did not have the in-depth information that I was searching for. Maybe, the topic is not worthily of the second highest office in the land."
4,it works,"it does what it's supposed to do. as a base under eye shadow, it keeps shadow in place all day."
3,Not definitive..not even close,"So much better footage out there...the bulk of the dvd is available in their complete form. This is missing most of the hits. Not a horrible dvd, just not a 5 star effort."
4,I Was Expecting Too Much!,"No mistake about, Kurmaskie has those vital writing skills. He has also been there, done that, seen that, etc. I think his first book was really outstanding. A make you grab your bike and go for the gusto! His style in this second book gets a little too breathless for me. Maybe I will change my mind after going for a second reading of between the lines!"
2,Not much of an adventure.,"If you love biking adventures you will hate this book. I just rambles about with very little concerning biking of any kind. My trips as a preteen were were more interesting. Also, the author tries to hard to be witty."
1,Did they read the book before making this movie?,"I was so very disappointed with this movie. The Linda Howard book was filled with memorable characters. Robert Cannon and Evie were both strong characters who had to change to meet each other romantically. This Robert was a wimp who was so bland--well he was pitiful. The book was nothing like the movie, the places, family members even the subplots were all changed. I could not really recomend buying it. It is so very bland. Sorry."
4,Pleasant scent,"I bought these for our Yorkie and they seem to work just fine. They have a pleasant scent, and they do not appear to irritate her skin. So far so good!"
5,Extech Power Supply,I use this power supply to make colloidal silver water. I recommend this unit to anyone else looking for an easy to use and reliable device.
2,Dr. Joseph's Footbrush Kit,"I was not pleased with this product but it is the only product that does what I need. My knees were bad, as well as my shoulders and I wanted something to wash between my toes. The little sponge comes off very easily so you need to be careful not to ""pull"" toward you when washing."
3,An overpriced keyboard - mouse combo,"So far so god, but do you have to know some things before you plunk your hard earned money on this...1.- The keyboard is like a laptop keyboard (the feeling, the keys and such), what I dislike from this particular keyboard is the ""Enter"" key which it's shape is small (rectangular, I rather like the near square ones).2.- The software is bloatware, you are better off this one. You may miss some functionality, like media pad displaying it's stuff and the like.3.- There is no doubt about the quality components you get, but again the price is too much for this particular combo."
4,Great for a small voltmeter,I've had several pocket voltmeters and this is my favorite. I like the design and how the test leads fit into the back. I've had one for several years and haven't had any problems. I'm about to buy a 2nd one to keep in my radio control toolbox.
5,An astonishing story told in fascinating detail,"...This still is the best book in English on the Spanish conquest of Mexico. Far more than most historians, Thomas explores the interconnections among the leading personalities, both Spanish and Mexican, giving the reader a feeling for the noble and the devious aspects of these sixteenth century people. Politics and the exercise of power emerge as major themes. The author brings out the contingency of history through his analysis of key events that might have gone another way. There was nothing inevitable about Cortes' ultimate success; if he had not been so clever and ruthless, he might have ended up as a human sacrifice in an Aztec temple. As it was, more than half of the conquistadors died, a casualty rate that no modern army would tolerate. The six hundred page text is supplemented by useful appendices. This book would be even better if it were more fully illustrated."
5,A True Masterwork,"Hugh Thomas forever banishes to the trash heap of history the notion that the native peoples of America simply rolled over and succumbed to the onslaught of sickness and Spanish swords. The final fight for Tenochtitlan looks less like the last gasp of a stone-age empire, than a dark portent of the cruelties of Stalingrad. Thomas, at complete odds with most his contemporaries in academia, presents a refreshingly balanced picture of two empires in confrontation. Heroes and villains appear among both Spaniards and Mexica, but Thomas avoids the temptation to beat one or the other over the head in the kind of revisionist name-calling into which most academic historians dealing with native America have devolved. Thomas's history of Cortez and Montezuma is fine stuff indeed, and is a rich and brilliant example to all--specialists, generalists, and lay readers alike--of what good history writing looks like."
3,a different approach to the essay,"Wendy Lesser has written an engaging book or half-critical, half-personal essays, a form that has gone out of style. She should be commended for reinvigorating it."
2,Vapid,"This is a book without a center, veering from anecdotes about her life to critical essays on her favorite male artists to ramblings about life and her sense of superior judgement about it all. The title, ""The Amateur,"" sums it up."
1,It stunk!,"I used this book last semester at a local community college, and it stunk.First, the book comes off as if the student already knows Macroeconomics. It uses difficult terms, it isn't harmonious (it doesn't ""flow"" well), it was confusing, and it obviously wasn't written for the layperson in mind.Second, some the excersises at the end of the chapter makes you answer questions that has little to do with the chapter you've just read. For example, after you've finished reading chapter 1 and then go on to the chapter review questions (and there are a ton of them) you'll find it hard to answer them because they had little to do with the chapter.I don't recommend this book to any college student. So far it has been the most horrendous piece of work I have ever seen!"
5,First took this out of my library - then bought it from Amazon,I was very pleased with the quality of the book. It has all of the patterns in excellant shape. I have made the Kimona and now I am working on the Nigerian outfit. It was shipped timely also.
2,BLACK TEA content is probably less then 20%,"while Numi tea is my favorite brand, for years, even when my budget is tight, this product is mostly a bag of dried fruit roadkill filler with a slim tease of black tea. holding 1 pound bag in my hand, its a real disappointment. dont you love misleading labels?"
3,Middle aged Punk Rockers - you'd never guess,"In fairness, this isn't the worst live album I 've ever heard. The production is good, you get a feeling of the crowds reaction without it intefering with the music. The problem is that the boys sound exactly what they are - middle aged punk rockers! The sense of outrage is missing, the youthful energy, the anger. This album has a truly awful version of Alternative Ulster which is pedestrian in tempo.To sum up, the first time I heard this album, I began picking out lyrics you could never place on the studio alboms - now that can't be right for an SLF album, can it!??Do yourself a favour & get ""Imflamible Material"" or ""All the Best"" instead.3 stars purely because they were so good on their day"
4,Trash Insert,"It came promptly, but was a lot more trouble to install than we had expected. My husband was able to do it, however, and it is a much better design than our previous one."
1,Cute bandana - absurd shipping costs,"This bandana is adorable, I must confess. I have a pampered pooch who has many bandanas, and the price on this one is quite average and certainly not unreasonable to pay for a small square of fabric.After I ordered it, however, I was shocked to see the standard shipping fee for this one small square of fabric was not $1, not $2, not even $3 - no; the shipping for this item which cannot possibly weigh more than an ounce or two, is $9.40. Until somebody can explain to me the absurdity of this I have cancelled my order, and will not order anything from this company again."
3,a bit unfocused?,"WHen I first heard this cd, I didn't like it one bit. Then it started to grow on me, and thought it isn't so bad. It's OK, not good nor bad, just average. It's his first album and I give him props for really trying, but the result was an average album. It's a classic, and it's what started the whole underground Manson movement. The lyrics are humorous, the intro is kinda spooky, and the little kid in Lunchbox was great. If you're thinking about buying this cd, I recommend you hear it first."
4,The Master of Mayhem begin,"Manson's very first. This stuff is very electronic and weird, but I love it. Not as good, as , say ""Antichrist Superstar"", but it's a good CD. Here's how I explain this CD: It's like one big, demented carnival. Buy this, and see how the amazing Mr. Manson, has always BEEN and always WILL BE, and rock icon."
5,a pleasant escape,"before all the publicity, there was this. this is a great album. its raw and flawed but dark and dense. this is where it all started. 2 of my faves are wrapped in plastic and lunchbox."
5,Manson at their BEST,"With songs like dope hat, lunchbox, get your gun, and my fave dogma this is simply put their best album the only thing dragging it down at all is the phone ringing on n on n on n on n on n on n on at the end of trak 13"
4,Exactly What I /needed,"I'm just getting into Vinyl. Got my first Turntable about a month ago, and I knew the current stylus on it was junk. (it was the original from 1981) Replaced it first with a Shure M92E and while it worked many of the records I was picking up are old and used. I also found out changing a cartridge on a shell wasn't as easy as I was hoping. (not that it was very hard) BUT this addressed all of that. Already mounted, just screwed onto my arm, adjusted the weight, and bam I was done. No more skipping playing the exact same albums I was before. So far I'm very happy. Highly recommend the M44-7-H, don't wait just buy and be done."
3,OK,"Well, this product was ok. Every thing works fine except that it took foreevere to deliver. It got lost somewhere and it took about 2 weeks and a half to get here. Overall it was a good buy."
4,Excellent for Some Musics,"The imaging, soundstage, resolution are excellent but definitely laid back. Not recommended for pop/rock 'cause I felt the ""energy drain"" BUT...excellent for slow vocal/jazz, warm musics. About the ""veil"", it can work for or against you, depends on your taste. If you hate the sound signature of Grado RS1 as much as I do than you would love this can."
2,Too heavy for a self training beginer..,This one might be a good reference book. But I was expecting a self paced program with a tutorial or step by step program but it is not such tool. Now I'm starting to search or investigate for a new book. The book presentation is good but I'm disappointed with its contents and format. The reading is too dense or heavy for a beginner.
4,This Is An Excellent Price!!!!,This past weekend I saw this same boot at a store in the Tropicana in Atlantic city for $225. I was stunned. I could not believe that this was the same boot I saw on amazon for under 50 bucks. I will definately be ordering this boot today!HKARLA75Baltimore
4,Classic Koontz,"Koontz is one of those writers who pumps out the same novel over and over, with different characters and scenery :) He is the West Coast Stephen King, which makes his characters more 'American' but often more bland than King's. King can also be deeper. Koontz' novels like to feature a white middle class male, his faithful wife, and a spunky kid, whose life is disrupted by the supernatural. Here, the kid is handicapped and adopted. The man dies and is rescuscitated, changing him and giving the story its hook. The supernatural is in the form of a young satanist male, a former California mall rat type, who lives in an abandoned funhouse, tries to kill the kid, and present it to Satan as a sacrifice to get into Hell. Add to this Koontz' knack for describing things with apt adjectives, and you have one of his better productions. Unbelievable silly gunk presented as matter-of-fact reporting, and begging to be made into a screenplay so he can afford his Newport Beach lifestyle :)"
4,Very good read,"I enjoyed this book,and how the author presented the personality of the little girl. Mr Koontz was able to mix drama, with both conflict, and a smiggen of comedy."
2,My Two Cents,"Hatch Harrison is reanimated by a noted surgeon, eighty minutes after he dies from a car accident. After what appears to initially be a full recovery, Hatch begins having strange visions of an evil young man clad all in black. Tension escalates as people who have done Hatch wrong are similarly murdered, and Hatch knows it has something to do with the link between him and the figure in black. Believing that the same fate may be in store for Hatch, his wife and his newly adopted daughter, he must reach down and find within himself the strength and will to become something more.The story bounces back and forth between the Harrison family and the serial killer's points of view quite effectively. Some scenes become more extended than they probably needed to be and I started to find myself skipping paragraphs here and there. The whole story came across as rather formulaic. Not bad, but also not really anything special."
4,Cool camera,"We use it for our baby. We can also talk to her at the same time. It's little limited on its perspective, but it's very handy and can be placed anywhere. We're going to get another one for our other daugter, so we can see both in their beds up close."
5,Configuring SAP R/3 FI/CO: The Essential Resource for Configuring the Financial and Controlling Modules,Configuring SAP R/3 FI/CO: The Essential Resource for Configuring the Financial and Controlling Modules very important for SAP Consultant
2,About this book,"This book is ok for FI , in controlling I think it has not given things clearly. How ever the most important things is no one giving the user manual.All these draw back , you will find it in the sap top jobs material and it is too costly also.All these problems are overcome by mr.surya. He has written a woder full book on ieternal order. You can have more information bt visiting his site www.surya-padhi.netNarayan rao"
3,A very good book but lacks Product Costing and Fixed Assets.,"This is in overall a very good book about the configuration of FI/CO Modules, it covers basic submodules but it fails to cover fixed assets and product costing (Which are very important submodules).I find it very useful that the authors included Investment Management, I haven't had experience implementing such functionality, but after reading the book and with the experience I've had in SAP FI, I believe I'm ready to implement it on my next project.A little bit expensive though."
5,A MUST have for all FI/CO participants,"Even though I knew quite a bit that is contained in the book, there were many facets that were new to me. I highly recommend it for consultants (and end-users who are trying to enter and understand the complex world of configuration). It is written in easy to understand English with detailed step-by-step configuration."
1,"Sad, Sad, Sad.....","this is horrible and so is primus, now i hate bigotry as much as the next person, and i believe that all artist deserve the creibility they deserve, this however only applies to legitimate artists, which primus is not, sad people they are."
4,Quite helpful,"I purchased this book for fun as a way to brush up on my grammar and learn things that I never quite understood about usage. This is more of a cover to cover read (if you want to get everything out of it) and not a book that you want to use as a quick reference. I found it more of a ""here and there"" reader more than something that I could become completely enthralled in since there really isn't any order or flow to it whatsoever.This book helps the reader to become a little more aware of grammar usage when it comes to everyday things, and it makes you realize how many things you learned incorrectly in school. There are, however, many questions drawn about usage that are left unanswered.The author is witty and at times sarcastic with her responses to her callers and can really come off as a grammar snob. On the other hand there is a lot of personality present in her writing which makes reading about the topic more enjoyable and less like a textbook."
5,Delightful!,"Accompany George on a tour of feelings and emotions where he is sometimes sad, and sometime silly. ""Are You Curious,"" explores the curiosity of children in an amusing and delightful way, ""Have you ever been naughty, so that you need a time out?"" This entertaining little board book will hold your babies interest through colorful illustrations and simple text. Birth and up."
2,Story line dull,The details of the book's subject were sketchy and the characters were stereotyped especially the buffoon captain the hero had to report to. Hard to recommend.
4,Understanding the past to better grasp the present and improve the future,"This is an excellent book to read by those interested in music as a generic concept and those that are curious to know how did we get to what we hear today. Understanding how the ancient dealt with scales, harmony, Intruments and ways to control them to improve the expressiveness of the performance.Ancient Greeks, India, China, Japan, the renascence Italy, France, etc... They are all referenced here.I only wished the referenced illustrations were also included in this version of the book, but for this price, I guess one can ignore that bit."
5,so awesome,This to date is one of the best albums Ive ever heard ; def one of the craziest ; in my opinion MM's best album ; being their first album too. IT arrived in great condition ; brand new and with a t-shirt . It was like bringing an old shirt back to life . Thanks alot
1,maybe they mixed alcohol in with my birthing solution...,"i read soft machine by WSB by recommendation of one of my best friends. he said WSB and many of the other Beats were off the edge. i watched the movie ""Beat"" as an amusing insight into a portion of WSB, after reading Soft Machine. Soft Machine, and forgive me for being an ignorant blah-putz, is REALLY difficult to get into. the first couple of chapters are nothing but random rants and raves. it sounds like the man was going for drug cocktails and rectum-stretching in some south american country. i just couldn't see the benefit to literature that WSB provides. i know he's a good writer because everyone says he is, but i'm not seeing it. to me, the emperor DOES NOT have any clothes on. oh well, i guess i'll die ... ignorant ... never knowing the greatness of WSB...."
5,Beyond,"I always loved this show growing up, and even though when I watch it now I can pick up and identify flaws in the story line and what not, I continue to find myself getting lost in the characters and building emotions for the characters. I really wish they had made more seasons of this. By the way I'm 23+ :)"
2,"Sacrifice plot for profits, much, WB?","Having already seen the uncut version of the movie before I got my copy for Xmas, I have only one thing to say. Someone needs to tell the WB to get off of their high horses and think of the fanbase. What I was witness too on Xmas day was a horribly butchered version of a great movie. They changed too much stuff, and most of the cuts were awfully bad. Even if you do decide to ruin a great plot, at least pick up the pieces and re-animate key scenes. Those of you who've seen the uncut version know what I'm saying. The final verdict from me is this - go on the net and get yourself a copy of the movie uncut. Save your money until the WB wises up and releases an uncut version. Vote with you dollars."
4,Animated,A friend of mine loves Batman so I bought him this DVD for a gift. He really enjoyed it. It's one of the best animated cartoons of Batman out there.
4,Uncut finally! The Joker in all his twisted glory!,"I had the pleasure of viewing the uncut version of this movie, as well as the edited version, and can say without hesitation that the uncut Batman Beyond: Return Of The Joker is a far better movie. The edited version made some fairly short cuts and alterations, but what was changed is EXTREMELY significant to the story, and this uncut version displays that excellent and tragic tale as it was meant to be shown. Never has the Joker been portrayed as well as in this animated film, with his combination of humor and murderous psychopathic behavior. The backstory is a treat for all Batman fans, and the main plot flows nicely. This one is a must-buy for any animation fan."
4,Great Guide To Forgotten Realms,"You can always have a map of a place in Forgotten Realms, but you can't compare it to this book. Once around the realms tells a tale of great journeys and also gives you inside info on the places and people located in FR. Travel with the Great Volo and the Famous Passepout from Waterdeep to Kara-Tun and back.It's great fun to read even if you all ready now everything about FR."
1,let's get for real here people,"like the show, this book betrays a mother and daughter relationship that is too perfect. they are best friends(like whoever heard of that from a teenage daughter). the mother and thegrandmother's relationship is more realistic. most of us getthrough our teenage years rebellioning and thinking our parentsare the meanest, unfairest people on earth so where on earth didthe writers come up with this story line? beats me. for bettershow try buffy the vampire slayer, charmed, or smallville. muchmore realistic."
1,SanDisk Photo Viewer,This product only down loaded the first seven pictures and then just kept looping to those pictures. It took 15 minutes to download those pictures. Tried this product on 2 different brands of tv's and also used 4 types of cards and it would only read 7 pictures. I sent it back and I am waiting on the refund.
3,It's okay when it works,"I wound up returning this item very shortly after purchasing it. It worked fine with a USB flash drive, but it wouldn't read the Compact Flash card from our Nikon CoolPix camera. Actually, sometimes it would start to read the CF card, but then the SanDisk Photo Album would completely lock up and not respond to any of the remote buttons. It may just be some incompatibility with the way the Nikon writes to the card, I really don't know. For my part, I'm going to seek out a similar device from another manufacturer and see if that works better. But the SanDisk will probably work just fine for others."
2,Wish I could use this item:,"I bought these for use on wall mounted TV. The power adapted that comes with it is for European Power, and cannot be used with US Power. To be fair, the seller did include an adapter to convert it to US Power, but it makes the transformer stick out twice as far from the wall and will not fit behind my TV on the wall. I have been in contact with SanDisk, who stated that they do not have the power supplies for these any longer, and now I have to try to find a power source for them myself. The second one was to be a gift, and I am not giving it to someone this way. I like Sandisk products, and want to keep these but am not happy about this power situation. It was delivered on time and packaged well, but it was downhill from there."
4,A perfectly delightful Victorian mystery.,"This is the second book in the Mrs. Jeffries series, and I found it a much better story than the first one. I also found that Ms. Brightwell's characters are developing quite nicely. Luty Belle is actually quite wonderful, and Mrs. Jeffries fellow domestics are perfect gems. In this book a dead girl is found buried in the basement of an abandoned house, and poor Inspector Witherspoon is again out of his element trying to solve a murder case that is a few months old (determined by the state of the corpse when it was found). Mrs. Jeffries and her crew are asked by the above-mentioned Luty Belle to find a missing parlour maid that happens to be her friend. Are these two instances connected? Mrs. Jeffries certainly thinks so, so she sends her helpers on various errands to try to solve the mysteries. I am looking forward to reading the other books in this light-hearted series."
2,The fail-proof enterprise,"although the author seems to point out some good points, i find the book out of touch with the common business that is just starting."
3,Erotica novel with a good story but not great character development,"This is my first time reading the author. I found the idea of the story a really good one and ripe with possibility/potential for great character development. It took me a bit to get into the story--not the smoothest of writing--but it really took off when the two lovers meet and begin to date. Up to that point I thought there was a lot of gratuitous sex and hanging out that I would have gladly substituted for better character development of some of the various characters in the book (her mother and brother and her circle of close friends). All in all, I enjoyed the book."
5,super monkey ball 1 and 2 and 46 new levals and less money!!,super monkey ball 1 and 2 and 46 new levals and less money then super monkey ball 1 or 2
3,"Not the most stunning artistic achievement, but still makes Vanilla Ice look like cold fish","A lot of people couldn't stand him rapping, and I won't say that he's the best rapper ever, but Mark Wahlberg did have a couple of pumping good jams here. His energy and charisma is at it's best on the smash hit party anthem ""Good Vibrations"" (which I heard on the speaker system at Morey's Piers in Wildwood, New Jersey just yesterday), and he really shows off his ""don't mess with me"" side on ""Peace"" which is definitely NOT a peace anthem, but the rap solos by the other members of The Funky Bunch make it a lot of fun, as do the funky horns (which, as I can best ascertain, were composed and arranged by Marky Mark's own backing crew, and are not built from samples)."
1,HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"I proudly do not own this CD, but a friend of mine is obsessed with him and has this CD. Don't ever buy it. It is not good. I wish I could give it less than 1 star. It would be such of a waste of money to buy this CD!!!"
1,Big Waste of Time & Money,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought this book. The revised edition simply has the typos corrected. At no time do you get the sense that an editor ever read this book. The language is mostly incomprehensible.The online site that is supposed to give examples and style sheets redirects to a dog breeding site owned by the author. After I wrote an email questioning that, it was changed. I have yet to hear back from the publishers, SAMS, and I would avoid all of their books because of this waste of paper.I started to make a list of omissions and vague descriptions after the 2nd chapter, but that list is too long to outline here. This is a very anti-design, techie look at CSS presenting an attitude that was out of date before the text was written.The project I was working on through this book failed, but I now know that I know less about CSS than when I started this book. I am going to have to unlearn what little 'Teach yourself CSS in 24 hours' has taught me."
3,He makes up for a lot!!,"I wasn't sure if I should buy this dvd. As a first minute fan of Barry, I know all the concert footage available, so this was a gamble. It is the concert footage of a Belgium concert. Not bad, but it's all we got from the master himself. Sound is alright and image could be better. If you want a concert footage of his last years on the road, this is the one to buy."
2,Only for diehard fans,"If there are any casual NIN fans out there considering buying this CD, don't. For less money, you can buy the Crow soundtrack and have all the same tracks, plus more. Another argument against this version is that it ruins the continuity of the CD. Trent had created an album that just ""flowed"", and the bonus track disrupts that flow."
5,Best album in my collection,I am so mesmorized by this collection of NIN's songs are played almost daily on my ipod at work to help pass the day. I was just introduced to NIN and can't get enough of their genious music. A definite must have to add to your collection.
3,hang in three,this NIN release has very strong moments and the lyrics are excellent. i rate this just shy of '4'stars
3,Didn't do much for me...,"Don't get me wrong, I'm a huge fan of industrial music and all things angsty, dark, and disturbing. But everything after ""Pretty Hate Machine"" just doesn't do anything for me. Sure it's good, but not as great as most people say it is. I bought this album just based on music site reviews and word of mouth, and was pretty let down. I'd say, skip this one and pick up a copy of ""Pretty Hate Machine"" or a Skinny Puppy album."
4,Its good....but worth the wait...? or extra money?,"Sure. 5.1 lends itself very well to The Downward Spiral.It is worth it if you are curious. If you are just a normal fan and have the regular Downward Spiral; i wouldnt buy it. Its more for people who want a distinct surround-sound.For the poster below complaining about PCM masters and Wave formats:The fact that this wasnt mastered from 192khz files is not really going to effect anything. If the songs were truly remixed, and new EQ was printed to each track, then the it is possible the new mix could be from 48khz masters. Most protools files are PCM files anyway; so dont know what the gripe about that was..."
2,The Bandwagon album that shouldn't be.,"For those of us who were huge fans of Pretty Hate Machine and even bigger fans of Broken, this came as a disappointment. There are a few decent songs such as ""Hurt,"" ""Ruiner,"" ""Reptile""(""Reptilian"" on March of the Pigs is better), and ""I Do Not Want This"" when Trent comes close to making music, but the rest of the album is avante-garde noise. And too much so. The most promising section of the whole album is the middle section of ""Ruiner,"" featuring a good bass break and some nice distortion guitar work. If you jumped on this bandwagon, jump off at the next album. Either that or trade this disc in and get ""Broken."""
2,Trash,"I really like Nine Inch Nails, I furst bought the cd ""broken""...and it rocked! But when I listened to Downward spiral, I was very dissapointed. It's trash, don't buy it."
3,I wish I could get ahold of a version with no lyrics...,"I love this music. Trent Reznor has a great talent for making electronic music with a genuine ominous, desolate feel to it, and I very much like every piece of music on this album. The problem is, Trent Reznor is a snivelling little wimp who writes some of the most embarrassing lyrics I've ever come across in an industrial band. After seeing how many worthless remix albums Reznor has put out that all sound the same, I wonder sometimes whether he isn't just in it for the money. Regardless, I'm eternally grateful to him for assisting the rise of Marilyn Manson."
5,''And you could have it all......my empire of dirt.......'',This is without a doubt my favorite album of all time. I have been listening to it since I was in the eighth grade. Now I'm currently a senior.....and I still can't put the CD down. Never before have I listened to an album which has manipulated my emotions like a puppet master. This album makes me hate when I'm in love.....love when I hate. It makes me happy when I'm sad.....and sad when I'm happy. I only wish that after I die......that this album could be played wherever I may go......be it heaven or hell. I cannot function without this album. It has helped to influence who I am.
5,A strange coincidence,"Oddly, I went after this record on the morning of 11 Sept 2001! I had just pushed the garage door shut and the first plane hit the tower(had the public radio station on). I was driving my loved one 45 miles to a medical appointment and heard the entire debacle play out in full. Eventually visited the record store that sold me tons of stuff since the 70s. Bob-O is still behind the counter. No other day like that one. I bought this as well as the remaster of Selling England by the Pound. The record listed here is strictly for those who make the leap between ROCK and CLASS! There are some who exist, believe me. Steve, if you are reading this, thank you for releasing this record. It has made me appreciate you in ways that GTR and even Genesis could never have done. Vivaldi done on guitar is the tops. This is one that I never tire of listening to. Why? I own thousands of recordings."
1,Find another brand,"This is a horrible design. In order to erase the board, I have to move the mechanism and press down on the actual screen in order to get everything erased. I would not recommend. Find another brand. I keep meaning to write the manufacturer to complain about this product. My son does still enjoy it despite it's flaws, but if I had seen it in person first, I would not have purchased it."
5,Fresh scent,"Garden (just like the name)is on my mind when I use this perfume. It is fresh and beautiful fragrance, great for hot weather."
1,Dwarves Are People Too!,"I feel that Disney has definitely crossed the line in poking fun at a group of short-statured miners. Even though each in the group had their own quirks, they seemed to single out Dopey, just because he was a little slow. So not only are they insulting people with hormonal defects which affect height, they are also mocking the mentally challenged. Disney implies that these types of people are outcasts, living alone in a forest. Disney also suggests that they are incompetent and unable to care for themselves until a pretty young, unknowing girl comes along. They are forced to do nothing but mine for jewels all day, while Snow White cooks, cleans, and takes care of them. They carry heavy loads of jewels and rock everyday, yet they are portrayed as plump, and cannot even lift a broom."
3,Too fluffy,The ideas presented in this book are interesting but I didn't like the religious undertones; Besides it's a little on the fluffy side.
2,Disappointed in quality,I have returned this product to the maker for a replacement and the new product is as bad as the first. The CDs skip. Some restart. Some don't play at all. I don't know about the content because I can't listen to all of it. (Yes I have tried multiple CD players in case the problem was mine and not the product.) I cannot recommend purchasing these CDs.
1,This book is blatantly a lie!,"Like myriad other new age authors, Dooley states that there is no sin; no evil and no hell. Well, I'm here to tell you that I know; yes, I know that there is! Before I had even heard of Dante, I had the same experience he did, only I was taken to only three levels of hell. I could describe them to you in exact detail, but there is no point because people are going to believe what they choose to believe. Just because someone hasn't seen something or experienced it, doesn't nullify the fact that it exists. And if this man has been on this earth as long as he has and not seen evil, I must ask is he unfamiliar with Adolf Hitler; Stalin; Leopold II of Belgium; September 11th or 9/11), where a series of four coordinated suicide attacks were launched by al-Qaeda on the United States, and many, many other proofs of sin and evil? Satan is the author of lies, and this author is attestation to that fact!"
5,"Stephen,","This is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It is inspiring,full of wisdom and hope. I highly recommend it."
5,Infinite Possibilities,This book is awesome. I think everyone should read it. Great insight into the human mind.
5,MUST READ!!,Mike Dooley's book is a definite MUST READ! This book is certain to change your life. I highly recommend it for anyone who is on a spiritual quest and wants to manifest only the best life has to offer.
4,Good read,"I really enjoy Carla Kelly's regency novels. Onyx is a quiet, illegitimate lady who accepts the offensive vicar's offer of marriage because she has no where else to go. En route to the vicarage, she is set up on by highwayman. Major Jack Beresford is returning to England after many years of war, manages to save her but is wounded in the process. Onyx nurses him until he can go home. When Jack gets home, he desperately needs her help to set things straight. This was a really good, heart-rending read. There is a lot of death in this book, so it's more bittersweet than her other novels. It's almost impossible to find this book in hard copy, so I was very happy to purchase the Kindle edition for such a small price."
3,cuff burns,Overall it is a great mitt. But there is a hole on one side of the wrist part and a magnet on the other side. I've managed to burn myself with both places (magnet holds heat) in the time I've owned this. It would be better if hanging hole and magnet were omitted or relocated on a tab.
5,Good research and an important example of failure.,"Those who are politically biased won't believe any of the facts in this book but there is plenty of evidence out there, even on the Internet, for those who want to verify these facts for themselves. Those who prefer to blame Bush, who had been President for only 7 months and 2 weeks when 9/11 occurred had hardly had time to lay out a plan for handling the threat, will do so for political reasons; but there is evidence that 9/11 plotters were in this country in 2000 and had at least appeared on the radar of our intelligence services that year. It's well known that Clinton preferred to handle terrorist acts as domestic crimes; this weakened the transfer of information between intelligence agencies. Thank heaven, we've learned from his mistakes; and are making a real effort now to combat terrorism. Strong action in the mid-1990s after the 1993 WTC bombing could have saved many lives."
5,I actually read it....,"Unlike some of the online reviewers here, I've actually read the book. Miniter is entirely credible. The book is very interesting and very well written."
2,No one man. No one party. Shameful politics here,"The problem with the basic premise of this book is George Bush was president for 8 months before 9-11. If it so crystal clear to blame Clinton, why weren't matters addressed with the new administration? Further, if UBL were such an easy target why hasn't W nabbed him in the last 2 years? Answer: Because it wasn't easy then, and it ain't easy now.As 'don't bother me with the facts' becomes more and more the right's mantra, these authors should be ashamed of themselves for their expoliting the tragedy to further their agenda.No one man, no one party, is to be blamed for our nation's most tragic day. Hopefully, the grown-ups will retake the debate soon on both politcal sides."
1,More right wing fantasy,"Even Jay Leno has all but given up on Clinton bashing. Bush got us into a war based on lies, and even worse he did it without an exit strategy. We can't find bin Laden, we can't find Saddam, we can't find WMD, what should we do? Hey, here's an original thought; let's blame Clinton. What a waste of money. Let's look at how Reagan and Bush 1 supplied bin Laden with stingers and other help in their fight against Russia if we really want to track the origin of this mess. Sure Clinton had problems with this area of the world; he inherited it from 12 years of Reagan/Bush, duh. Save your money; the only people who will buy this book are right-wing fools who want their flights of fantasy confirmed by an author all too ready to cash in on their pathetic need for validation."
1,Gag!!!,"... Miniter is not only blatantly biased and pushing an obvious right-wing ...agenda, but his writing is just painful to wade through, it reminded me of bad college-newspaper editorial writing. All polemic and half-truths in the service thereof, but unlike some conservative writers like George Will he doesn't even have the saving grace of a witty or fluid prose style ...Safire and Will are at least decent wordsmiths; ..."
1,Questionable revisionist history,"Not a worthwhile purchase and but always run across his books abandoned by my friends and I advise you to do the same. There should be a law in these times that require books to be labeled ""not written by a professional historian""."
2,KARLOFF!!!,"Pretty dull, until the last 20 minutes or so. Karloff is obsessed with egyptian mythology. Unfortunately for the inhabitants of his now-vacant mansion, he's only MOSTLY dead.Worth a rental if you're a Karloff fan. Otherwise, skip it."
2,Maybe Not So Hot...,"I know all of the other reviews are glowing, but I was actully disappointed by this book. While it is very thorough, I found the structure of the book to be haphazard and unintuitive. There are a lot of occurances of ""but first, lets go back a bit,"" a sure sign of poor writing. While trying to keep to the problem-design-solution framework, the authors often introduced ideas in the problem phase, but never clearly addressed them in the design and solution phase -- often vaguely tying it all together with a statement like ""and we took care of this problem as well"" without really referencing it.There is a great deal of information in this book, but I found it very difficult to extract coherently. And saying ""but its not for beginners"" is no excuse for poor writing."
3,"Enjoyable, but not as good as expected.","Although I enjoyed Minor Miracles, I really expected more from it. Although a lot could be done with a book using this theme, most of the ""miracles"" presented here don't even seem to be GOOD things, necessarily. It's a fun read, but mostly forgettable.I will mention that I was impressed by Eisner's art. It's fairly detailed, but in a sort of warm, human way that much modern comic art could stand to emulate."
4,Kae Jude: Fearless Vampire Killer.,"AFTER DARK introduces Kae Jude, a US Marshall specializing in Paranormal Crime, in an alternate America where vampires have become commonplace. As she hunts 'rogues', she too is hunted, by one vampire who wants to kill her and another that wants to love her. It's tough being Kae Jude since she's surrounded by endless murders and gets beaten up left and right, but she takes a knocking and keeps on rocking .... Reads kind of like an X-files novel, fast-paced, cool dialogue; a promising debut."
5,A product that works,Does a good job. Haven't had it long enough to find out how long the disc's will last and they are not cheap. Well worth the price.
4,The Best of Times,This movie came out when I was in my early 20's. Robin Williams and Kurt Russell were great in the this movie. Now that I am in my mid 40's I myself am looking at going back in time one more time on the gridiron. Good story about redemption and getting a second chance. One for your private football movie collection.
1,dont buy this book,"This is the WORST book I have used in my study of finance. It is full of errors and it is written in such a way that it is extremely hard to understand for an average student. There are lots of calculations that are unexplained, assumtions are made that are never addressed,and it is just plain vague in virtually all subjects it discusses. Buy a different title if you actually want to learn about finance."
3,"Technically competent, but out of date and lacking examples","This book by nature handles a very dry subject. However, there are few, if any, examples, and most of those are not relevant to today's technology. In the examples the book does work, units are not kept track of, making it dificult to ascertain where a certain value in an equation came from. In my opinion, this is a good book; it just needs a facelift."
1,Stupid and boring,My kids found this series to be very boring and the hosts corny. Not enough action too much talking. There are better videos available in this price range.
5,"Pretty cheezy at times, but the kids will love it!!","My son got this video for his 3rd birthday, it looked like it would be fun to watch, my son loves trucks so this was right up his alley. As I'm sitting there watching it, in my mind I'm thinking, ""we won't be watching this again."" But once the video was over my son says, ""again?"" so we go again...and again...and again! He loves it!! The only reason I didn't at first was because it was so cheezy. But it's geared towards kids, and that's what you have to remember.The video does a great job with showing kids what a monster truck can do, along with some other veichles you'd see at a Monster truck show.My son loved this video so much I went out and bought some more from this series of ""there goes a..."" I definately recommend this video to anyone who has a child who loves Monster Trucks."
4,They are transfixed!,"We have about 6 of the ""there goes a..."" titles, but both my boys are just mesmerized by this one. They watch it twice every night! My 21 month old baby is always asking for a ""mon-ter tuck"" and he is just as transfixed as his 3.5 year old brother.Yeah, the plot is hokey, but the plot seems to keep them more interested in this video.If you have a little kid, this is a great way to keep him (or her) happy and give you a little time to yourself."
