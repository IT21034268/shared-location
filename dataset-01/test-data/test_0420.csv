3,OK but shortcomings over time that bug me,"I've had this rice cooker for about 3 years and this my list of things I like and can't stand.Like:Timed cooking is great.Steamer is great.Okayuu or porridge works great.Rice generally is cooked perfectly all the time regardless of how long you soak the rice.Compactness is great for small kitchens.The thick pot is great and very durable.Can't stand:There is no tray to collect the moisture so you have a pond that you have to soak with a towel after each use. Every time you open the lid, moisture drops down.After extended use, the spring which keeps the lid open weakens so the lid will always drop over half way. If upright is 90 degrees and closed is 0 degrees, the resting position is about 20 degrees or enough to interfere with your rice scooping."
3,ONE FATAL FLAW with the BATTERY,I loved my unit until the internal battery went dead. I sent an email to Sanyo and to my chagrin was told that the battery is SOLDERED in place on the main circuit board and that the cost of a new circuit board would outweigh the cost of buying a new one ! ! !What kind of asinine research and development team puts together a product like that?Fortunately I've found a work around and can still use the unit without the battery but when the time comes for replacement it will not be a Sanyo unit.
2,Some Non-Lemon-Flavored Napoleons are Lemons,"I've been a fan of Napoleon Lemon sours for ages, so I decided to give the assorted candies a try. What a disappointment! The citrus flavors (lemon, lime and orange) are delicious, but most of the others are, to my taste, mediocre or yucky (the cherry seems like medicine to me). The seven-pound minimum quantity means that I'm stuck with a whole lot of candies that will never get eaten (unless guests pick them from the bowl on my coffee table). Would not purchase again -- although I would buy the non-lemon Napoleon flavors if individual flavors, not the assorted mix, were sold."
3,hard to use the glitter,My daughter wanted a doodle bear so bad and has hardly touched it since she got it. This particular bear seems to be too slippery to use the glitter markers on. My daughter is quite disappointed and has really only played with it one day. I was kind of disappointed because she loves to draw and color and I really thought this would be a hit with her. Maybe the other ones that aren't so slippery and shiny would be better.
1,Not worth it,I have purchased all of the Harry Potter books. I enjoy reading them. I knew this was written by another author but I thought it would be informative. This book was not even worth buying. Had little information and a grade schooler could of written it.
4,Give this book a chance - the map is great!,"I love the style of the map, it is like maps of olden times, and the book of secrets is also well done. This is worth taking a look at, I would think that a serious Harry Poter fan would want to have it in their collection - I do."
1,piece of garbage,Nice cut and paste job of basic information freely available out on the web. Don't waste your money..
5,Get this book,"I wasn't sure if I would enjoy a humorous vampire story, but MaryJanice Davidson had me hooked from the first page! I love her stories. The humor in them is perfectly written and well matched with the characters. She is an auto-buy."
2,"So so book, many bad recipes",I have to say that about half the recipes in this book turn out to be pretty bad. I don't use it anymore for cookies and only rarely for bread. I find the proportions are not good. I do a lot of bread baking and the best recipes are off the internet. I wonder why we even bother with mediocre books like this one.
1,"Revolting - not like ""real"" crackers at all",I was looking for a good gluten-free cracker for wine and cheese parties - something that my friends and family might want to eat too - and these are NOT it. They are nasty. Even the dog would not eat these terrible crackers. They taste and look like burnt birdseed. Try the Glutino crackers or rusks instead. The Glutino rusks work well with soft or spreadable cheeses like brie or chevre. They do not crumble so easily as most GF crackers.
1,"Very hard, has a burnt taste","I have to agree it will ruin the taste of anything you put on it with a sandy, bittery burnt taste."
1,It tasted like burnt,I dont know if it was suppose to taste like burnt but i felt like eating burnt rice. Did anyone felt this?
5,Bird seed wafers,"These things are horrible, lol. My son with autism loves them though, and that's all that matters. The very first box we bought because they are gluten-free. After trying them, my wife and I said ""Oh no way, he wont eat these."" So just to be sure, I put a few in front of my son. Much to my surprise, a child who refuses to eat things like rice, rice based pasta, mashed potatoes, and a zillion other gfcf foods, loves these things. The supermarkets sell these for upwards of $5 a box, depending on where you go. The best I've seen is $3.79 a box locally. Amazon, as usual, slams through the basement with the price when bought via subscription. Thanks Amazon. The break is much appreciated."
4,Destination Moon/Rocketship XM,"Excellant Movies for older people like me who grew up on the early 50's Sci-Fi. We can still appreciate that, although not on a par with Star Wars or Jurassic Park etc., they were masterpieces of their time."
4,...So close to perfect,"This product is perfect, I don't know how they do so im not going to bother looking for the right words in my vocabulary. I guess you have to try it to believe it. It came last night and I tried it on my aunt's dry frizzy hair and it worked great! And it only took like 10 minutes. I did experience some of the pulling hair but that's totally natural because ALL straightenners pull hair alittle bit. The trick is to just get the hang of it because it very important you have a good grip and comb your hair out. I gave it 4 stars because it can be improved and I hope it is in the near future. The size it pretty big but I guess it makes it easier to get large chunks of hair. I love the steam burst. Im writing this review after having used it this morning so my soft hair is in my eyes. hehehehehe...So it's close to perfect and I would definitely recommend it."
5,SAVE MONEY & TRIPS TO THE BEAUTY SALON,"I love this product. Before, I had so many bad hair days, I didn't have a clue on how to do my hair. I bought those cheap flat irons in the past and my hair still ended up looking like crap. I used to go the beauty salon and spend a lot of money on hair cut + blow and dry. Now I don't go the beauty salon, I save money and never have a bad hair day, thanks to the Maxiglide. If you have curly or frizzy hair like me, get the Maxiglide, it really works."
1,i hate this,i dont personally own this item but my mom does andwhen i asked to use hers it didnt even work first of all and second it snagged my hair very badly
2,Can U Say BORING????,"Most of Disney's new movies are very, very boring. And this one is no exception. I'm not saying that the original B&W version was good, but this one is bad, too. In the original, Flubber was not a green humanoid figure. It was a gray blob. There are some things that are better in this one, but it is still BORING!!"
4,An Engaging Version of an Epic Story,"Anyone who has read Mary Renault is probably familiar with Greek history, and so has probably heard of the Battle of Thermopylae. But for those of you who aren't, that's when 300 Spartans and 4000 allies held off the invading Persian army, which, according to the source, was just under a million or just over two million strong. The Spartans died to the last man. This battle has captured my attention like few other historical events, and ""Lion in the Gateway"" is a great book to tell about it. The book is for youth, so it is probably less detailed than other Renault stories, but it provides a good overview of the Persian Wars and a stirring account of the most courageous warriors ever. It also dispels, or at least counters, some popular notions about the Battle of Marathon. (For another great account of the Battle of Thermopylae, try Steven Pressfield's ""Gates of Fire."")"
2,"Fine performance, questionable interpretation, awful remaster","It was difficult to decide just how to rate this item. On the one hand, Toscanini's performance with the nbcso was as usual very impressive, although maybe lacking somewhat in understanding of how the symphony should be interpreted - which may account for Shostakovich's dismissal of this performance. Whatever the merits of the performance, RCA's remaster was terrible. I am used to 78 rpm mono remasters, and expect some surface noise, along with mysterious clicks and rattles. But this remaster was so over burdened with extraneous noise and loud repetitive clicks, that it is really hard to listen to. I am going to get Karl Ancerl's mono recording from the mid 1950's. It is almost as good a performance with much better mono sound, per multiple reviews."
3,Good movie marred by lame ending,"An interesting Canadian horror movie staring the beautiful Olivia Hussey and a good supporting cast including Andrea Martin of SCTV fame. The movie's fairly straight forward: a bunch of women in a sorority house get offed one by one and it's looking like it's a distraught boyfriend (of course) of one of the women who's doing it. A few good twists and turns, spine-chilling moments and the like. Not bad for a Canadian production, but the ending is kind of predictable and the cops are just too incompetent which kind of ends the movie on a lame note. Hence three, not four stars."
4,A horror gem,"Renting this out of curiosity (I am a devout HALLOWEEN fanatic), I found an odd movie that works quite well within its genre. Nice direction by Bob Clark (who ironically also did A Christmas Story, very popular on cable during the holidays), with the infamous ""point of view"" shots that predate Halloween. The music is fairly subdued, mostly atmospheric piano noise, paralleling Keir Dullea's character. This creates some unnerving tension. Margot Kidder is a kick. The murders are disturbing in that gritty style unique to the 70's. And that eye peering out near the end...it gives me chills and that doesn't happen very often. I'd love to see this movie come to DVD."
5,"before ""halloween came ""christmas""","olivia hussey stars in this creepy little known slasher movie that came out years before halloween. bob clark director of ""porky's "" and "" a christmas story"" takes the idea of a killer in the house to it's most terror filled end as an unseen and never known killer slips in to a girls collage dorm as they are getting ready for christmas break and starts picking them off one by one. if it sounds like the plot to everyother slasher movie you ever saw remember this one was first. it will creep you out, give it a try."
3,great friday night/turn out the lights/popcorn flick,although i was disappointed with the ending (am i the only one who didn't get it?)it's a movie i'd watch over and over. margot kidder is a great bad girl and the lush of a house mother is a hoot! classic 70's horror flick.
1,No wonder hardly anyone's heard of it,"This movie is a joke, trust me. There are far, far scarier films out there."
3,Frightening in a few parts but.........,"Frightening in a few parts but the ending was a huge dissapointment. The killer's identity is never revealed nor is it explained what was the motive behind the senseless killings. Who was this obscene phone caller/Killer? What is his background and why did he choose to invade and murder the women at the sorority home? In the films ""Friday the 13TH"" and ""Halloween"" we knew the motive behind Mrs. Voorhees' and Michael Myers' murder spree, but in this film...it is left unexplained. Why?"
3,the breather wants your blood...,"not the best slasher flick ever made, not the worst either.i won't go over the plot here (it's already been covered by others) but it involves an obscene phone caller (to a serority house) doing lots of heavy breathing and making threats, etc. they could have toned down on the breathing some, etc.flick contains a few surprises; a nice spooky, atmospheric touch here and there.i wouldn't call it a classic, but not a bad scare flick at all. however, a director with a genuine interest in horror would have had the ability to punch up the gruesome jolts a bit (not necessarily by including more blood, either. see the first tcm, for example) and given the fans more bang for their buck."
1,"Black Christmas(Original,1974) movie.","The movie is a slasher movie but it sure takes long to move along,it's boring,almost sleepy boring. phone calls and threats and some slasher. nothing special. Halloween is still the Best movie(years later of course) and Friday13 movies."
3,Black Christmas,"For its time, Black Christmas would have been a highly original and frightening experience. This 1974 slasher film was indeed quite creepy, but I found some scenes were always going on forever. Olivia Hussey's performance was fair, but it was Margot Kidder who brought this film a very high quality. The unknown killer is very disturbing, always saying his name is Billy and calling out for a person named Agnes. Overall, this film was pretty scary, but even if it was the first of its kind, it wasn't the best film ever made. Pretty good I guess."
1,No Customer Service,DVD stopped working a week after warranty was up. No one ever answered the customer service line. Do not buy this TV....it is a waste of money; spend the extra money and buy one from a known brand with a customer service department
4,Pleasant taste,"I ordered this product by mistake. It is very close to the one I meant to order. After reading the ingredients, I realized this was very similar to the one I meant to order, better price, so I kept it. Too early to know if there are any benefits. I do have to applaud this company for it's honest labeling. It stated 200 mg. 90 tablets. that is what it is. Unlike another product I ordered, the Nordic naturals DHA, where the labeling was deceiving or at least confusing. it stated 500 mg.90 gels. I thought that meant 500 mg per gel/ 90 doses.It actually is 250 mg per gel. 45 doses."
5,Elvis Love Me Tender,DVD came as described. It is a gift for a Dear Friend who loves Elvis as I do. Have to say I wish it were mine :)Thank you for it.
3,NOT IN COLOR (as advertised by Amazon!),"Now, WHAT a major disappointment! Look at the product description. It says: ""Format: Closed-captioned, Color, Dubbed, Special Edition, Subtitled, Widescreen, NTSC""Did it say Black and White OR Color?Did you say Color?Yes, that's what I thought I saw, too.There IS a colorized version, so Amazon leads us to believe this is IT!Isn't that false advertisement?I emailed them and demanded an explanation and a refund on that product!Sure, I am a big Elvis fan and I already have that movie, in original Black and White.I bought this one, BECAUSE they advertised it in COLOR!So, people, BE CAREFUL, DO NOT buy this thing if you also expected it to be in color.I give 3 for the fact that it's not Elvis' best movie, but I'd give Amazon a MINUS 5 points, if they'd have a negative rating system!"
1,Hi Everyone! I hope you're all having a good day!,"Greetings! Well I like this CD because of the clever optimism of this young child prodigy! When I go out partying with my little six year old friends, we always blast this (along with my new Now 15,206 CD) and jump up and down on the couch and shout ""COME WITH IT!"" as loud as our little lungsies will go! The coppie poos might try to say no, but we just shout, ""COME WITH IT!"" and they leave! Yumpin' Yimminie! So to sum it all up, pleeeeassse buy this cd, along with the new Baha Men cd, ""Who Put The Dogs Back In?"" Oooh, they wanna know! LOL! Greasy Chicken Peices, Jimmy"
1,Please Get This Kid To LEAVE!!!!,"This may possibly be the worst CD I have ever bought. Come to think of it, I'm not sure why I did. I'm not interested in cheesy little kid tunes like this (which, people is pretty much all there is on this CD!) I guess this would count as, um...dance music for 5-year-olds but I think anyone older than nine should forget about it! He sort of ""sings"" like he's a ""dance-rapper"" but, sorry! It's not working. I suggest to Aaron to think about a new music approach (If he must! Frankly I'd rather he just left us alone, but whatever.) if he even wants his career to work out at all."
1,Painful just to listen to,"It's unfortunate that after the amount of people it takes to assemble a pop album, its still not possible to listen to without becoming ill. Aaron Carter was fortunate enough to have a brother in the Backstreet Boys, another awful, talentless pop act. Thus, with even less talent than his older brother, his parents whined him into the music industry. Now, we are left with a collection of poor singing and even worse rapping by a 12 year old who has been snatched out of school and given a job which he shall never suceed in-being a decent preformer. Why can't we just give record contracts to people who deserve them?"
5,How can you say most of his fans are under 12??,"I realize that there are a lot of fans out their under 12, but there are a lot that are older than that too. Most of his fans that i know are around his age and older. I really don't know any little kids under 12 that like him. I think people need to give him a break and let him continue what he likes to do. He's songs are all preppy and hyped up, some people like them and some don't. I think people just need to let him do what he's doing if you do or don't like it. I would recemend this CD to anyone around his age (12-14)that like pop music like BSB Britney NSYNC and stuff like that. I like it and if you do cool if you don't thats ok. Thanks"
4,This CD is really cute!!,"This was a good CD!! There was a few songs that I didn't like though!! I just don't listen to those! I don't know why so many people keep putting in your reviews that it's like a bad thing that he's talking about girls! He's 13!! Am I wrong ( I f I am sorry! But I'm sure I'm not!) I don't see why theres a problem!! I could write so many more good things bout this CD, but I g2g!! Bye!"
1,Aaron Carter puts the RAP in crap,"It's albums like these that degrade the essence of hip hop as a mature sound in the industry. I'm not only talking about Aaron Carter, but he's a contributing factor as to why rap in general is starting to be nothing more than a joke. There are so many artists working hard to maintain the integrity of hip hop, but so many are ready to demean it for the sake of ""bling"" (as coined by MTV). Money's fine, so I could care less if he makes money off of this album. William Hung makes money off of his new CD too. It doesn't mean it's any good. Aaron Carter doesn't know anything about what hip hop is about. This is just ice cream truck music in the world of it, and I'm amazed at the amount of positive press this album has."
1,a 2yr old eminem wanna be,"last year arron was singing like a little bubble gum backstreet wannabe, but then he thought..""hey maybe if i try to be bad, kids might actully like me"". So now he tries to rap. This is the most dumbest cd i've ever herd and the songs are dumb to....Since when has a little dorky two year old beat shaq. And what kind of person sings about internet friends. I have tons of internet friends and i dont brag about, besides those are probily the only friends he has. if your a goofy teenybopper who only buys cds cause you think the person is hot, then go ahead and buy this. if your a person who has common sense, then buy this.......and flush it down the tolite"
1,A Real POS!,"My father purchased this thing about 15 months ago.The HDMI outputs don't work,(thought it was a bad cable)Both of the composite outputs don't work.Can only get the S-Video, and component outputs to work. Save your money, buy anything but an ilo brand."
4,Great deal,"For a f2.8, this is a great deal. The soft focus is 'kinda' cool, but nothing you can't do -and control better- in Photoshop. But it can be turned off, and that's how I use it. I like it a lot."
1,What's the point?,There is nothing on the DVD side of this disk. Buy the CD instead and save some money.
3,"Good lens but no ""L"" series","I purchased this lens used since it's discontinued. I read some pretty good reviews about it plus I own the 28-105mm 3.5/4.5(which I love) so I figured it would be a good match. I wanted a nice compact and light lens that for travel with for my Full Frame 5D. My first impression was that this lens was a Dud. Not very sharp and not very saturated. After getting use to my 10-22mm which is very sharp and other 'L' series lenses this lens did not match up. However, after I bumbed up the sharpening in the picture style settings by a couple of notches the image improved significantly. I then teested this lens against the 28-105mm and the results were about the same with the 28-105 being just a tad sharper. All in all it's a pretty good lens for the price I paid for it. The only thing to remember is to boost the sharpening and you will be fine. Of course if you are shooting RAW it might take some Post Processing to get the image up to par."
5,A truly wonderful account of varied people,"How It Really Was: A Memoir of ""The Greatest Generation"" by Patricia Hunter Gray is her personal account of her life's adventures, beginning with growing up in a small Indiana town during the Depression era, where her family was as hard-hit by bad times as everywhere else. Patricia enjoyed travel a great deal, going from one end America to the other, and then eventually traveling around the globe. A most thoughtfully written and engaging autobiography, How It Really Was is a truly wonderful account of varied people, events, and places in a restless, yet highly enjoyable lifetime."
1,No way to treat classics like these Universal Should be ashamed.,Universal Studios should be ashamed.Here are 8 classics and universal slides them into sleeves that when you try to get them out they necome scratched and marked up.Its about time we the public stand up and say no more and make universal and other companies give these classics the respect they deserve and give them each individual cases for each film.the public want to keep these classics in pristine condition but cant the way these studios like Universal pack these discs.Stand up Horror fans and dont buy this collection or any other that slides these classics into sleeves that damage them when you try to remove them.Avoid this collection and all others that do this kind of package.Send the studios emails and also Amaqzon and tell them they should not be selling collections like these packed this way.
1,$144 for this?,"This isn't a real review of the titles but I couldn't resist giving my two cents. I received an email from Universal on the release of Universal Classic Monsters on blu-ray. I was thinking $30-40 for the set and was floored when I saw them at $144. I won't be buying them but if you do, I hope they look very very good. $144, man......"
5,Outstanding Blu-ray release!,When I read that Universal was restoring these films from the best HD elements and releasing them on Blu-ray as a set for their 100th anaversary I was thrilled. I could hardly wait. Well I just recieved them and watch them all and was floored by how beautiful these films were. Worth every penny!
1,NO WEREWOLF OF LONDON????????,Wow! No new extras. All the old extras we already have seen are plopped back into this edition. Can't wait!!!! Werewolf of London is not a classic? Thanks NBC COMCAST UNIVERSAL or whoever owns you this week.
4,UNIVERSAL CLASIC MONSTERS,Hi there- I have the Blu-ray of THE UNIVERSAL CLASSIC MONSTERS COLLECTION. The films play beautifully. My issue is with all of the DVD extras. When I click on them they come up as a small 8' inch square image in the upper left hand corner of the screen. Why is this? Does anyone else have these issues with this collection.Please help and advize.
1,Great transfers but defective discs.,Beware. The first shipment the Mummy disc was defective. I didn't watch the others. The second shipment was also defective. I thought I would live with it until I got to the Creature from the Black Lagoon. It too was defective. Amazon was great but Universal apparently has no problem selling defective discs. The transfers are amazing but I sent them back.
5,great classics,"I'd seen most of these movies before but not all. have really enjoyed getting reacquainted with the ones I've seen before and seeing the others for the first time. Universal has put together a really good collection of the best from their famous monsters. they have been great to watch, the quality of the picture and sound is amazing!!!"
4,Postmodern bliss,"Kathy Acker is a truly unique writer. She blends classics, politics, surrealism, autobiographical elements, raw emotion, graphic, ""pornographic"" scenes, humor and much more into strange, memorable and sometimes confusing postmodern literature. Beacause the author often doesn't follow the laws of a linear plot her works can be difficult to get into. But it's worth the effort. There's nothing like Acker's writing."
4,Mind-Reach: Scientists Look at Psychic Abilities (Studies in Consciousness),"There is still some unshared data out there, some was in this book and I enjoyed it for that"
2,Really? The 25th Anniversary Collection is 4 Episodes?,"Like the other reviewers have already said, 3/4 of the episodes are on other (much better) Shark Week collections. The episode ""Blood in the Water"" can be found on the ""Jaws of Steel Collection"", ""Ultimate Air Jaws"" is available in ""Restless Fury"", and ""Myth Busters Shark Special"" can be found in ""The Great Bites Collection"". The other episode, ""Great White Shark: Uncaged"" could have been much better if they would have cut out all the shots of the crew talking and goofing off. I'm very surprised that they deemed the ""25th Anniversary Collection"" only worthy of 4 episodes of which, only 1 is ""new"". If you're looking for some good Shark Week action, I'd suggest the ""20th Anniversary Collection"" or ""The Great Bites Collection"". This will be the last time I ever pre-order a Discovery Channel video."
5,Good quality tool Best Price,Good quality tool Best Price a bit bigger than i really need the 6inch set I have works well installing cat5e and this 8inch set with rg6.
4,Great Book for ODE's,"I used this book for a course in ODE's. The edition that was available for purchase at our school's bookstore also included a book by the authors for using MatLab for solving ODE's, The combination of the two were great. The book is logically structured and generally easy to read. The authors use many examples from a variety of fields. The MatLab book was a phenomenal help: it's the best intro to MatLab that I've found, and was very useful in helping to solve problems. My only beef with the book is that since this is a first edition, there are several errors in the odd numbered solutions at the end of the book, which caused many sleepless nights."
3,Okay. Do not recommend for referencing. need good class notes.,"I bought this book because it was a requirement to have for the class. Could rarely ever reference it or rely on it for understanding. I'm not sure what it is in particular but I wasn't a big fan of the presentation. I in all honestly used it primarily for assigned problems and that's it. good thing is as always, price on amazon beats the bookstore price."
2,Maybe not so good....,My son found this book to be largely unhelpful in his second course on differential equations where this was the course textbook. He frequently found himself going to the internet looking for better descriptions of the material. I ended up buying him a couple of better rated books on Diff. EQ. to get him back on track.
1,Worst workout tape I've ever tried.,"I hated this tape. Here's why : 1. You need to be very fit to do this tape (which I am not, so there's no way I could keep up). 2. The movements are WAY too fast. She doesn't give you proper form on the movements, just hurries through them at an extremely fast pace. I have several other exercise tapes and this one I gave to my husband as a ""test tape"" to use in questionable VCR's. It broke and we threw it away.I like Heather Locklear a lot but I hated this tape."
3,You can do much better.,"During the entire first half of the twentieth century, Toscanini was widely regarded as the greatest conductor who ever lived. I'll never understand why. These are typical Toscanini performances: Amazingly precise and absolutely heartless. As usual, Toscanini reveals himself as a human metronome, not an artist. If you want the Beethoven Symphonies recorded around the same period, the Furtwangler is absolutely marvelous. However, if you only plan to buy one set, you can't beat Leonard Bernstein with the Vienna Philharmonic on DG. Truly great performances without the limited sound quality you'll find in both the Toscanini and the Furtwangler."
2,Not A Good Book For New A+ Test,"I read this book from back to front. I also have experience in the field so that help me a lot. If you are new to this I suggestion you look into something else. This book will help you on first test if you buy the unlock code which I did which cost [U.S. dollars] which they refund towards the test. I wrote and passed both test and found that this book lack a lot of information on second test. It covered the first test information but again why should have to pay them extra money for extra questions..?? To all people that are going to take test go to [another website] and get the exam brake down, that will help you understand what's on the test and than look for a good book, not this one. And also you should that the test is only 20 to 30 question and you only have 30 min to write this book is based on old test scheme."
2,OK if you're struggling to understand wrong answers,"If you are taking LSAT tests 19-28 and are able to figure out why your incorrect answers are wrong then do not waste your money on this book. I immediately purchased this book when I bought tests 19-28 assuming that I would need the book to improve my performance. The book has turned out to be unnecessary. Of the dozen or so old LSATs I have taken I have yet to find an incorrect answer that didn't become apparent within a minute or so of reflection. When I initially consulted this book for help in understanding my mistakes I was very disappointed with the superficial reasoning and, in some cases, by the text's failure to actually explain the reasoning behind some of the answers. I gleaned some useful tips (ie, save parallel reasoning questions for the end of the section, etc.) but otherwise it was a wasted thirty bucks. If you understand your mistakes save yourself the cash."
4,My Turtles haven't used it,"I have 2 grown red eared sliders and neither of them has paid much attention to the log since I put it in their pond a couple weeks ago. They seem to like the stationary platform I made better but the log looks good in the pond anyway, so it's not a total loss."
5,The best winter camping guide ever?,"There are two types of winter campers: those who have this book and those who need it. Perhaps if you are very very experienced you don't need it but otherwise, get it! Allen wrote a short, but information full book, that is easy and fun to read quickly and jamn packed with a mix of basic functional knowledge, extra tidbits that are good to know, and all kinds of little tricks he has discovered over the years."
4,Beautiful watch.,This is a lovely watch which works very well. I would certainly give it as a gift to someone special.
1,This cd stinks!,I listened to it once and the first thought that came into my mind was they sounded like sick cows frozen in a pasture. Don't get this cd. There is so much more better groups than this. I tried selling it but no one would buy it. They either had it already or agreed with me. The songs were cool. But I just think they should have some one else sing them. Don't get me wrong they are an ok group. Just not on this cd.
3,TOO MANY SLOW SONGS,"The upbeat songs are great, even the pseduo-rap song ""Dizzy"" is pretty good. I never did like ""Give Me One More Night"" that much, but the rest of the faster songs are good. Just too many ballads. These guys could sing better than 'Nsync ever could, they should have been more popular. Oh well, we still have this album and the previous ""98 degerees and Rising"" album to listen to. Oh and by the way, Nick, Drew, and Jeff are the best looking of all of the boy bands put together. YUM!"
3,Revelation isn't revealing anything new,"Ok, so 98 Degrees are back with new material and ""a new sound."" But I just don't notice it. I mean, this album has the same problems as their last: all the songs seem to mesh together. 98 Degrees and Rising had the disease a little worse, with the only stand out tracks Because of You and The Hardest Thing, but Revelation has definitely been struck with it. They have basially two types of song: fast and slow. And all the fast songs are the same and all the slow songs are the same. The only satnd out track on this one is Una Noche, which gets pretty annoying. Also, now 98 Degrees is desperatley trying to achieve the level of sucess reachedby fellow popsters 'N Sync and Backstreet Boys. To do this, they try hard to rip off some of the quality songs that 'N Sync has created. Such as Dizzy (Digital Get Down) and The Way You Want Me To (It's Gonna Be Me) so, it's not a horrible CD, but it lacks originality and variety."
4,Cool CD!!,"well I just bought this CD today and i think it ROCKS!!! I met 98* before too, and they are the sweetest things! one of my favorite songs is my every hting, and my other fav is the way u want me....And of course Una Noche! WEll, thats my opinion, over all, ITS GREAT!!"
4,a closet 98degrees fan =),"if you are an nsync fan, this cd mirrors ""no strings attached"" but with more slow songs. the slow songs are really romantic, although i prefer the faster ones such as ""uno noche."" this cd will be a *fun* addition to anyone's cd collection (even closet fans such as myself!) enjoy!"
2,"Call me maudlin, but...","Contrary to the others who have given a review, I found myself pretty disappointed by this edition. Where was Chiun??? He certainly wasn't the guy who used the word ""maudlin"" and spoke in such even tones. He certainly wasn't the man who passed up so many opportunities to bust Remo's chops when given so many invitations to do so. One of my favorite aspects of The Destroyer is the relationship between Remo and Chiun and I just didn't feel it in this one. I liked the idea of Remo trying to take on the role of the thinker. What a rich environment to poke relentless fun at Remo, but it never materialized. Better luck next time."
1,disappointed,"I didn't like this at all. The story was predictable, and the ending was even worse. I wish I hadn't paid for this one. I love a good scary/disturbing book but this is not the way it is done."
5,Jack Ketchum is awesome,"Every time I find a new story of his, I can't put it down! I am in the middle of this one and it is great. Almost as good as The Girl Next Door...if you haven't read that Ketchum classic, get it."
3,"Jack, are you posting these reviews yourself?","""Jack Ketchum must be read"" - oh, give me a break, people. Try reading a mature novel written for adults with intelligence instead. The only thing Jack Ketchum cares about getting a ""stranglehold"" on is your wallet. And what's with the cheesy cover art on all his books?"
1,would not play on my computer,"Try as I might, I could not get this thing to play on my computer -- a Dell running Windows XP, Media Edition. The seller proposed that I try reconfiguring my computer, and advised that I had done everything all wrong by trying the settings suggested in the Windows Compatibilty Wizard. Ah well, I don't see my way clear to re-doing my whole computer just on account of one game. I must say, I'm disappointed after reading all the great reviews of this program. Not sure I'll even be able to get my money back!"
3,Charlie's opinion,"""I like it because it shows you the proper way to type; like where to put your hands and stuff."" Charlie age 7"
4,Fun and educational,"My 7 year old daughter loves playing with this typing instuctor game. It tracks her progress so we can see her accuracy and her speed in the days or weeks to come. It shows the child in an easy an accurate way finger placement. I think there is up to 11 games to play, but we haven't gotten that far yet.I am only giving it 4 stars instead of 5 because we haven't gotten through the whole thing yet. Love it so far!"
5,Perfect first stroller,"I am surprised to read the reviews on the durability and quality of this product. I purchased this for my 1 year old, the youngest of four, and this stroller takes a beating daily from her older brothers. I have had no problems with the stroller, it has never fallen apart or broke. The stroller is very small and best for a young toddler. It is a great first stroller."
3,Fair price for a FAIR MATTRESS,"This is a fair price for a fair mattress. Our family does have to replace this mattress for our second child because it is not firm enough for him. If your baby needs less firmness, then this mattress is fine for you."
3,Western Humor,"The Tao Te Ching is considered among the most beautiful Asian texts ever written. Although a subtle sense of humor pervades the text, most westerners in my opinion would fail to see it amongst the beauty of the text. This book is a great way for many to understand the humor of the Tao Te Ching.For those interested in more slap-stick style humor (more popular in the west) I recommend ""Zhuangzi Speaks"" by Tsai Chih Chung--a famous Taiwanese cartoonist. Zhuangzi (Chuang Tzu) was a famous contemporary of Lao Tzu and his outrageous stories lend themselves to cartoons. ;~}"
5,A Great guide. Every episodes in it. It's great!,This book so vividly describes evry detail of every episode. It takes alot of talent to write this kind of book. I loved it!
5,Thank you Peter.,"I read this book in 1999. My husband, age 55, was dying from a brain tumor. I screamed and yelled at this book. Thank you for teaching me the true meaning of death. Thank you for teaching me God's Will not mine. Thank you for teaching me praying is Heaven on earth. Thank you for teaching me death is a test of faith but real faith cannot die.Thank you for the meditation from St. Augustine on the death of his dear friend for I, too, would not live halved. Of all your books, I love this one the most. I still read and meditate on it."
5,Nomadin- The instant classic!,"This book is a fantastic novel of magic, fantasy and genius that no person should miss out on! A great book for all ages, it is much like the books The Lord of The Rings, Harry Potter, and The Chronicles of Narnia. Fantastic, Shawn Cormier! Bring on some more!"
3,An interesting look at the old school style,"The description of the video might make it sound like it's the best of the Fabulous Kangaroos--please be aware that it's not. There is a Kangaroos match here, and a fairly enjoyable one at that. Other wrestlers on the tape include Bobo Brazil v. Ski Hi Lee, The Bavarian Boys vs. Skull Murphy and Brute Bernard, The Graham Brothers vs. Antonino Rocca and Miguel Perez, and a young Bruno Sammartino against an old Hans Schmidt. None of the matches are true classics, really, but watching the tape does give you a good idea of exactly what it means to be old school."
5,For Children Of All Ages,"I love this book. My children love reading this book and my grandchildren love having this book read to them. The sounds of the words are musical, the story is beautiful and it teaches important lessons about friendship and honesty. The illustrations are lovely. I give this book as a baby gift and as birthday presents to my 50 year old friends as well."
3,a book for older children,"This is most definitely not a book for the 4 to 8 crowd. In fact, I would go so far as to say this long hard-to-follow fable can only really work in middle school. And middle school children don't usually study fables, so there you go. However, if you are studying philosophy, religion, or the teachings of wise men in a unit about how to act rightly in life, Ling Cho and His Three Friends would work well.In short, this is a book with limited usefulness. And, although it has beautiful illustrations, I would say it is neither a must-read, nor a must-own."
3,Just a note,The book is not bad but not as in depth like I was hoping for it is good for a younger person who should start writing there own thank you notes and letters.
2,Not so great,"I wanted less ideas and more actual words to write in cards. If I have to think it up myself, why do I need a book? I'm already thinking it up myself now. I wanted something more like lists of choices of things to say in cards for each occasion. This book gives a few for each occasion. Not enough, in my opinion."
4,A great show...,"I first viewed this show on dvd and might I say i'm impressed.This had some great stories and cool actors.This show holds up well today,too."
5,chaos princess,Has to be one of the best cop and robbers show of the seventies that David Soul and Paul Michael Glassner complimented each others performance every episode. That huggy bear charcter gave the show that comic edge where it was needed.
3,"A long awaited sequel that, sadly, disappointed.","I found the tetralogy that preceded this work to be a truly unusual reading experience - a story more of texture than of action or cause and effect. Though this concluding volume is a grand work, and presents much to ponder, it failed to capture my imagination and draw me in the way the first four volumes did."
5,I loved it!,"What was so wonderful about this book, aside from the basics: great plot, great characters, great development, were the characters themselves. There are three main characters in this book and I loved all three equally.Cathy Kelly did a wonderful job of letting the reader see each of these very different women as who they were, and yet also let us see how such different women could form such a strong friendship and bond.The pace of this book was very well done. Many authors skim over details and only focus on the big things...but not so with this novel. Cathy Kelly took her time, while all the while not creating a slow-read.Great writing!!"
4,Enjoyable Read,"I enjoyed this book. It was lengthy and I definitely did not finish it in warp speed as I might have if I had felt more entangled with the plot and characters, but that said, I did like the characters and the plot. It is definitely a book that you have to go into reading remembering that it is more about the journey than the ending, but if you keep that in mind, I think you will like the book. It is typical chick lit to some degree, but the three main characters could not be more different. Hannah is the typical single gal, while Emma is married trying to have a baby and Leonie is a single mom with three teenagers. I think the range of characters and the back and forth between them keeps the book fresh and the subplots are very interesting."
3,For young eyes only?,"I was disappointed to see what really seems to be a promising text (see the other, enthusiastic, reviews) that is compromised by its designer.First, the typical page uses a light (thin) font -- so thin that it looks as though it had been screened. (Nope, just light.)Secondly, the lines of text are set across the entire (wide) page, in a single column -- approximately 130 characters, or twice the maximum that is generally followed.This challenges all but the best eyes, or someone using the book in poor light. It's a pretty book, but it cannot be READ."
3,Good but not great,"The book seems well organized upon first glance. However, as I read through a procedure, the text seems to cover 75% of the task and then trail off. I don't feel there is a resolution to the topic before the next one starts. I like the ""why/how it works"" discourse at the beginning of each section to explain how a system is intended to operate, but beyond that the procedural portions are not as satisfying as ""Zinn and the Art of Mountain Bike Maintenance"". Zinn just seems to cover each topic as completely as possible (covering different brands quirks) rather than a general procedure that leaves a little of interpretation by the user for their particular case. This author at least encourages working around breaking the chain to save from constantly replacing links whenever you work on the drivetrain. I recommend the Zinn reference over this one for a beginning home mechanic."
5,BEST BROWN AREA cd,"this cd is one of the best brown area, gots tons of features, on the inside booklet its got a picture of over 20 plus homeboys from all over califas who putt it down hard on this cd. must have defintely."
4,An interesting journey,"I found her writing to be easy to read, chronologically well done. Since there are a few sensitives in my family I have always wondered what the process would be to educate them as to their gifts. I was relieved to read that there was an ethical instructor for her to learn from. I'm not sure the general public is aware of a code of ethics for Psychics.There were a few grammatical errors, I'm not sure if these were original to the manuscript or not."
5,"Personal, Down to Earth and Inspiring","I got this book when it was recommended to me by a friend. I in the end bought all of Sonia's books.All I can say is that reading about Sonia's life, lessons, readings and teachings really inspired me. There is a lot to get out of this book if you are willing to think about what she is saying. Some of the lessons that she undertakes with Charlie and Dr Tully are useful if you are training yourself.I loved the fact that she was rather specific about her life and her readings, good and bad. I have read other peoples life stories and they are not as honest and engaging.It is truly as if you opened her diary. I will read this book again and again."
3,DIMMER Switch,"I haven't installed this yet, because it is the DIMMER SWITCH for the headlights (which i don't think is the problem, so i may be sending it back). APPEARS to be in fine condition and arrived timely."
5,A nice compilation,"For all you Joni James fans, like myself, this is a fine compilation of many of Joni's hits of the 1950s and early 60s. The performances are typical Joni and the technical quality of the recording is good. I don't think you will be disappointed and would recommend it to all Joni fans."
2,Teaches his own technique,"Be warned this DVD focuses on a ""better"" technique, so doesn't necessarily reinforce conventional technique. There's some good in it, but it's a little disappointing.Also what we watched could hardly be considered ""Expert""."
4,Happy with Pack n Play,"I love this play yard! It is so cute, and it took my mom and I a short time to put it together. The only thing I wish were different is I wish the changer would come off a little easier and that the diaper holder could remain on the play yard when the changer is off. Other than those few things it is a great buy"
3,"Good, but not as wonderful as the predecessor",I LOVED Baby 411. I found it to be to so helpful that I was relieved when I discovered that the authors had written a follow-up guide and I wouldn't have to continue this uncertain path of parenthood without them. Unfortunately the book falls short of their first. Perhaps the first guide is so well constructed I learned how to understand my child - if that's the case it's a real tribute to the authors. But I haven't found as much helpful information in this edition. Even the environmental hazards section with occasional good advice doesn't explain why and how things are dangerous (so my toddler shouldn't be nearby when I dry my hair - but will she be forever scarred if she occasionally is?). It's worth a perusal but there are much better books out there with medical and developmental information for this age group.
5,So easy to read,"This book, just like babies 411, is very easy to read and finding answers to your burning questions is not a problem. Love the was it's written, these laddies approach all problems with a good attitude and a sense of humor. I highly recommend it."
2,No answers,"This really didn't have any answers. Basically it pointed out what I already know. Toddlers test. But they didn't have any basic strategies to work with. Just stories about how everyone is in the same boat. Great. But with a title like Toddler 411 you kind of expect ""information"". I didn't find this helpful. Although find it amusing that my 14 month old pulled the book from the table and destroyed it. Now that was a picture for the photo albums!"
2,okay,"I have to say I didn't learn much from this book. This is a book for someone who knows nothing about kids, like one of those ""Toddlers for Idiots"" books. I was expecting to learn more tricks and so far I haven't. Maybe because I have their baby bargain book and it was my bible during my pregnancy, I may be expecting too much. But for any questions I have, I haven't found any great answers. I probably would save your money and google your questions or ask friends and family with kids."
1,Not a good resource,"I have used quite a few ""Intro to"" books to learn various applications, and this one is at the bottom of the list. Granted, some of this may be due to the fact that I'm not overly enamored with QuarkXPress itself, but this book does it no favors. Information is not organized well,and the index isn't helpful.In short, the book doesn't do a good job of teaching Quark as a whole, AND if you are looking for help on a particular topic, its almost impossible to find. Now, to be fair I haven't read some of the other Quark books, so they may all have this problem, but I found this book to be below the standards of other training books I've used in the past."
4,hard to find product,"a great hard to find product, not sold in stores anymore.towelettes werent as moist as i hoped but ok."
5,Quite Good,"Very good album. Upbeat psychedelic pop songs made by good people with a great live show. ""Fear of Heights"", ""I Was On The Moon"", and ""The Egg"" stand out. Buy this album if only for the sole purpose of keeping these guys off the streets."
1,These goggles are for kids,"Do not buy these unless you are buying them for your kids. Amazon should change their descriptions, so people won't order them thinking they are adult size."
4,"Cheap, Works, Nice Looks","If you're around 5'5"" or shorter, these goggles should fit fine for you. Cheap, didn't fog up, and looks good."
3,a very different type of socket,This socket uses a ratchet that turns the outside of the socket. If you don't have the special wrench don't buy this socket because the inside is just a hole.
1,never received,I have never received this on my kindle either and I paid for it. I need help in making space in my cloud for more books and music.I have too many apps I don't use that are taking up space and don't understand how to delete them. please help me
5,ya gotta love it!,"Truly a ""must have"" for anyone interested in the Highlands, Islands, Myth, legend, origin of great stories, terminology that runs through (and is often misused in) many modern ""magic"" books. This is clearly a labor of love by a real enthusiast, and while not absolutely comprehensive will give most of us lots to mull over and enjoy for many happy hours!"
4,Really Noisy but Really Cool,"It's amazing to feel the amount of air that it makes but it's really, really noisy, you should buy a fan controller to change the speed and everything will be fine with the noise."
5,An excellent text to fill in the gaps in practical knowledge,"This book was an excellent guide for passing the 70-175 exam and I would highly recommend it for anyone with VB-COM experience looking to pass the exam.This is NOT a book for beginners or those desiring to become a paper MCSD. It is meant to supplement existing knowledge derived from other guides or practical experience. It does an excellent job of filling in the gaps for those lacking significant experience with the lesser used VB technologies such as ActiveX documents, WebClasses and disconnected ADO recordsets (to name a few)."
5,Probably the best one you can find,"I was going to give it a 4.5 stars because some of the information is not accurate, but as you read along carefully, you will find that out yourself. Also, the book is excellent if you want to pass the exam, it heavily focues on the exam. Like the book says, if you want hand-on experience, you need to do practice along with the book. If you can afford the MS Press book also, you can do their labs and get some hand-on experiences. I found out that I remembered the details much better when I do the labs and also it make the learning experience more interesting.You will find the real exam very easy if you digest this book."
1,Dissapointed,"The bottle I recieved is 100 mg of phosphatidyl serine, not 500mg as advertised. I knew it was too good to be true."
2,ugh,"I started loosing interst in the newer spider man books after this comic, i found a disturbance with the second one that was more artist than story but volume 3's story is cheezy but spider man is still the man, even if they try to change his persona and twist the story."
4,Well Made,"This is a necessary accessory that you need to have to connect your camera to the bracket. This is a really solid, and well made system, but rather pricey! A very professional bracket though. With a good monopod ( I recommend the Manfrotto 685B Neotec!), this is the very best for weddings, etc..Manfrotto 685B Neotec Monopod Deluxe with Safety Lock (Black)"
2,"Not Written for Dummies, Really.","I was disappointed because in the introduction, the author states that he assumes throughout the book that the reader is already a user of powerpoint. So, its not written in a way that even gives the basics, which seems like a book for dummies should do. It's more like a intermediate book on powerpoint,and it may even be a good one."
2,Not His Best Work,"I am a huge Prince fan, but I can't understand the raves about this album. It reminds me of Rainbow children. Only one or two songs that you want to play over and over, but not an album you put in rotation."
3,Fairly Mediocre,"Not bad, not good.....just mediocre. The tempo of the album is off due to the placement of songs. You have uptempo, slow, uptempo, slow....you get my drift. IMHO this messes with the cohesiveness of the album making it hard to get interested in it."
2,Underwhelming. This makes Musicoligy and 3121 seem like SOTT,"This album is listenable. It is somewhat enjoyable. Compared to what most consider the purple ones worst albums such as Chaos And Disorder, Emancipation, Rave Un2, this album is not much more than a fungal side not to these albums. I own every prince album to date. I must admit with the exception of For You, I think this is Prince's worst entry to date. Johovah has killed Prince musically. I say death to Jehovah and bring back Prince. He takes no risks, nor shows any emotion on this album. By far his weakest entry in the past 28 years. One must remember, even a bad prince album is still pretty damn good, but compared to his back catalog this is misery."
2,Not His Best,"I have only listened to part of Prince's latest, and it's not at all what I would have liked to hear. I am more of a fan of his funkier and jazzier stuff. This one kind of just lays there and tries to be more jazzy and R&B. It's not bad, just not quite what I anticipated."
1,"Awful. Unlistenable. Emaciated, pale and emotionless.","I've also been a fan of Stan Rogers for at least 20 years. I had high hopes for a fresh interpretation of some of his best works. This isn't it.All the vocalists combined can't match Stan's own range. The opening bar of the Mary Ellen Carter (1st song) gave me high hopes for the rest of the CD, but I was BITTERLY disappointed.The idea of a mediocre tenor singing Northwest Passage would be laughable. But that's what they did here. They absolutely butchered his music.This entire album completely lacked the emotion and passion that Stan brought to his music. It was a cheap, hollow imitation that wouldn't have stood on it's own merits in the absence of Stan, but knowing (and loving) his music made it even worse.It was the equivalent of expecting the finest Filet Mignon and getting a cold, uncooked hot dog instead. Yecch."
1,I have to agree to disagree,"I have been a Stan Rogers fan for over twenty years and I have all of his released works. As was said before, if the selling of this CD helps Stan's family, I can see the value. But despite their apparent passion, these performances pale before the beautiful rich tones that were Stan's. These voices may intend to honor the man and his music, but instead serve only to remind us what we have lost. Listening to these renditions brought tears to my eyes as I remembered the excuisite voice that was Stan Rogers."
4,It Pulled my Heart Strings!,"I thought the story was oustanding! The plot is thick and from the press material I thought I would get lost with the many characters but I didn't.I liked how the book flipped from the past to the present. This was powerful story that shook me up a bit. The way the characters all connect and how their lives became to be what they were I found outstanding. These are the types of stories I like best. I didn't find the abortion issue waying one way or the other. I didn't find it forced. I felt all the characters and their love and loss. I do recommend this novel. It's thick with a story that will linger long after the last page.reviwed byDawnnyMahoganyHudson&Albany, N.Y."
4,Great tools for the price,I ordered these for tool box in truck. Made in USA and very good quality. Great price and service. Should they be stolen I'm not out thousands like my shop tools.
2,Book needs more color photographs,"As a person who pieces quilts and does beadwork, I usually see an actual quilt or a piece of beadwork OR a color photograph of an item. After viewing an actual item or a photo and appreciating the colors and the pattern, I then decide if I want to make it. While this book has 50 charts for bead weaving and 21 patterns for applique, there are only four pages of photographs showing a total of about 26 items. I was dissappointed that there wasn't a color photo for every design in the book. People want to see what a finished product will look life before taking the time and effort to make it."
3,WrestFest 94 review,"Well It's a short review I definately consider myself to be a wrestling connaiseur and this is in my opinion a classic however It's not like Survivor Series or Summerslam or something like that. The best thing aboutis you have the Macho man hosting it which is very funny I miss that about the older days and you should too.The next best thing aboout it is that there are 3 appearances by the Hitman because at that time Vince was relying heavily on Bret,which as we all know prompted Micheals and Nash and Hall,and HHH to help destroy the dignity that Pro Wrestling had (ReadBret's Book)or(Dynamites Book#(wrestle crap##the death of Wcw) or any book that accurately describes wrestling history)so of course the worst thing about any tape I get is when I'm forced to try and watch Nash wrestle if you can call it that.But as talented of a technical wrestler Sean#chickencrap)is ,as usual he's over the top and makes a pathetic match."
5,It was exactly what I needed!!!!!,"I was diagnosed with ADD as a child so I knew all the technique's about time management and test taking, and daily planners. But I had no idea what to do as a self employeed, wife/ mother. It has already given me great idea's and I've only had it a couple of hours. Also it it written in a VERY ADD friendly format. You can go straight to the suggestion you need. LOVE IT!!!! It was worth every penny!!!!! Oh and it has easy to cook recipies"
3,A Little Disappointed,"I had high hopes when I purchased this book, because clutter and piles are my ADD nightmare. There are many good suggestions in this book, but there is a lack of comprehensive discussion about the issues faced by those struggling with ADD, what leads to those challenges and how we can avoid them. If you're looking for a great compilation of testimonials, this is your book. There are many comments by other sufferers outlining their struggles, which are pretty common to many of us. Unfortunately, the organization of the information in the book made my ADD mind spin."
5,A Homespun Classic,"This, along with Parts 2 and 3 (Amazon now sells volumes 1-3 as a set) is a now classic Homespun Instructional DVD, with excellent camera work, proper TAB (nicely legible!) and gifted instruction.Artie Traum has recently passed away and left a huge hole in Americana, but his warmth and enthusiam live on in his instructional DVDs. His love of DADGAD is all over this DVD, as is his enthusiasm for some of the most simple and beautiful sounds found on a guitar.This is a simple DVD, truly for beginners, but is a necessary part of the series which builds one upon another, with increasing complexity. A strong foundation is essential for the more complex songs in DADGAD found in volume 3, though Artie shows that this tuning is not complex, with much beauty coming from one finger chords.A five star DVD release for content, camera angles, gifted instruction, and clear Tablature. It is what is expected from Homespun."
3,Not as glamorous as it could be.,"Some nice additions to the base game, but you can find much nicer stuff for free on the internet on free sites."
1,Where's the glamour?,"This pack offered very little of anything. The decor (very little of it) is uninspired. I was hoping to get some good artwork at least. I know a lot of people don't like to download from fan sites but don't waste your money on this junk. Believe me fansites have much better and more creative stuff for your sims and most of it is free, and none of it cost as much as this glamour life stuff pack did. This is the first and last stuff pack that I will ever buy."
4,glamour life stuff,nice new formals. beats those ugly ones you got with the original sims2!now if we only got to pick our shoes and jewelry...
1,Overpriced and Out of Date,"It is my own fault that I missed the publication date under ""Product Details"" but future buyers should be aware that this book was published in 2000 and has not been updated. This makes the touted hardware recommendations and software reviews absolutely useless. The book is pre-Windows XP!Apart from that, the general introduction to the subject of webcams is useful to the very new user, particularly those whose computer skills are still at the year 2000 stage.I paid $39.38. By the time I had opened the overnight package, the price had dropped about $6. This is a large print, 288 page paperback with very wide borders on each page. Not much info for the price."
1,A very non-historically accurate book,"A monotonous, inaccurate look at boring topics such as stone age architecture."
5,Voyage to Western Civilization,"Here comes a guy who really enjoys books and mankind. With infinite patience he manages to accomplish a tour-de-force of western greates legacy: art through its varios manifestations.If you have just heard of Aeschylus, Dante, Michelangelo and Bach I think it's time to get to know your cultural heritage better. It's a pretty long book albeit very amusing. Keep it beside your bed and have a nice trip!"
3,The Creators: A History of Heroes of the Imagination,"A book focusing on Art,and Architecture should at least have pictures of the items being described. It made the book difficult reading due to this.The person that sent the book sent it in A-1 condition and in a timely manner."
2,Creating an average read,"I think I was looking and hoping for stories behind the great works of art Boorstin researched. What I got in most cases was a description of the work. Since I'm familiar with most subjects covered in this book, I kept wondering why I wasn't reading or appreciating the work itself. At times this book is too detailed, recalling too many passages from particular works or focusing too much on one work and too little on others. I suppose the last statement is a judgement call, but this is a source for my dislike of this book."
2,"Works OK, But.........","This functions well but I get a ""battery door open"" error message on a regular basis."
4,Worth it to celtic music fans,"I'm not sure I understand the harshness of the editorial for this CD. I was pleased to have stumbled across it and find most all of the tracks pleasing. CD #1 is the best arrangement and it is better than filling your CD player with celtic and hitting random. For anyone new to celtic many of the arrangements are slow and with only a hint of celtic undertones but overall a nice cold weather, hot tea type of CD. This is worth the money if you want a relaxing celtic sound that you can put on."
1,Be thankful! Don't buy this!,"I wanted a collection of thanksgiving songs that I could play in the office this week. I should have spent my money on the Tabernacle Choir. Even ""Over the river and through the woods"" sounded bad. The kids did not know all the words for their songs. One song had the background music in a different tempo and rhythm than the singers. I heard wrong notes and off key sounds periodically. Finally the suprano crucified Amazing Grace with her screeching voice.One reviewer wrote that it sounds like church music, but the average person on the street can sing better than this. I agree with the reviewer --who wrote after I bought this--that said it should have never been published nationally. I would go so far to say maybe not at all. Be thankful, but don't waste your money."
4,A gift for my wife,"The ring was well made and just as described. You have to be careful with pewter, though, as it's softness makes it easy to deform."
3,Not so sure,"Please try it for yourself, but from my experience and what i have read here, it would be nice if it worked for at least somebody that reviewed it. i used the convert from dvi-d to dvi-i off my laptop to this dvi-i to rca, no luck"
4,Whoa Jed,"To say that Beethoven was an acquired taste of Horowitz in the editorial review is completely inane. His recital performances of op. 31, no. 3 eclipsed that of any other pianist. Even Casadesus was extremely impressed by the remarkable sensitivity that Horowitz brought to this sonata. Distler's comment reflects a basic musical ignorance. Moreover, most taste is acquired."
5,Encompassing View of Developments on ADD,"I am very pleased to find the chapter ""Advances in Biofeedback"" in the table of contents of this book.EEG Biofeedback, also called Neurofeedback, is what is meant by this, and is a non-drug therapeutical treatment which has been proven nationwide in thousands of cases with impressive results!There is a book called 'ADD - the 20 Hour Solution' which shows what Neurofeedback can and can not do from the perspective of the parent or ADD affected."
5,most excellent book on subject,"this is the most complete book on add every written. Dr.Lawlis has put together the most complete information available based on extensive experience. HIs system will be implemented soon. I highly recommend this book for all parents interested in the subject.Andrew K. Messamore,M.D.,R.Ph."
3,Somewhat puzzled,"Read this book as a (divorced) father of 3 boys. One diagnosed with ADHD now 12 years old. In my opinion this book offers a series of helpful suggestions that could help in certain situations including useful checklists but certainly is not ""THE ADD Answer"". Overall the book seems to come up with somewhat typical USA style ""perfect world solutions"" for ""out of control situations"" which is a bit of a contradiction because ""out of control situations"" do not occur in a ""perfect world"". Reading the cases it amazed me how far both parents and ""professionals"" let things get out of hand concerning children and I must say that was fortunate enough to avoid the excesses as described in the book without having to rally around the child with the whole family (which doesn't exist in my case) etc."
1,17 million new cases?!?!?!?!,"According to the NIMH there are about 1.6 million cases _total_. If the rest of this book is as accurate as that statistic then, well, that pretty much says it all."
3,Dubious quality,One glaring omission is that she fails to mention that SSRIs can cause permanent sexual side effects even after discontinuance. Long overlooked by the medical community. Do google search for details.
5,DO NOT LISTEN TO DOCTORS!,"Do not listen to the review posted just under mine. This book has saved my life, as long as people who have no experience being on any of these drugs, keep talking about how ""safe"" and ""helpful"" they are, the more people with think it is ok to take them. This book is well written, and deserves much praise. As someone trying to get off paxil, I can tell you it is the most hellish experience of my entire life. This book has given me hope, I no longer feel alone."
2,Story about hospital policy instead of suspense...,This book had a great premise. Too bad the author chose to focus on hospital policy and administration more than than the story line. This book was boring. It jumped from story line to policy chapter after chapter. It was a struggle to finish.
3,Typical medical thriller,"I've read a couple of Michael Palmer's medical thrillers. They're just ok in my opinion - they read fast, have some plot twists, and come to a satisfying happy ending. On the other hand, Palmer's writing style is stilted and filled with cliches, the characters aren't terribly multifaceted, and the plot is predictable. So, Flashback might be a good choice if you're looking for a quick, fluffy read and like medical thrillers, but don't expect to be wowed by any stretch of the imagination."
4,Chaos Magick for everyone!,"Visual magick is not a book for beginner. If you do not know anything about magick, this book is not suitable for you.After you moved the first steps in magick, and you want to know more about chaos magick, then this is the most clear book about this kind of magick. Jan Fries is a very clear writer, and he knows well both easter and western magick traditions."
5,Guitar-Tapping Manual,"Tapping has been part of metal and rock guitarists arsenal of techniques since popularized by Eddie Van Halen. In this book, the tapping techniques presented go beyond that to include triad tapping, scalar tapping and advanced techniques similar to that used by players like Vai, Satriani,Greg Howe and Jennifer Batten. An excellent resource and reference."
5,the ultimate first wingbook out there,"bought this at the international wing festival, which adopted the book as its official festival book..has contest winner recipes in it, recipes from around the nation and some nice side dishes and dips...even endorsed by franks redhot.This is a fun book..i will buy some for christmas for my friends..ps...easy recipes."
3,The Patch of Blue,"Reviewer: A reader from South Bend, Indiana. A Patch of Blue was an okay book. I felt that they dragged it on. They could have summed it up in about halph the pages. Yet, once you really get into the book you just can't put it down. It teaches that friendship and love conquire all."
2,not so great for bunny,"I have had several issues with this product.1. Too big, my bunny (medium sized) can sit and lay in it.2. The litter resembles food and made my bunny really sick3. The pan flops overThis would be a better product for outside of the cage, but as a starter I would start with something smaller."
5,perfect,"I bought this because my new baby mini lop was peeing in 2 corners of his cage, when I put this in he started peeing only in it, eliminating the mess right away. I put the provided litter balls under newspaper and hay to be sure he didn't eat any of the little balls. Seems to be working!Easy to clean, fits in the corner of his outdoor hutch. Would recommend for sure."
4,Pretty Good Product,"The litter that it comes with isn't very good but I like how it connects to the side of the cage. Also, the scooper that it comes with doesn't do its job very well. I would suggest this to anyone who doesn't mind the scooper not working and the litter not being very good."
2,LSAT Explained needs another book to explain itself,"I found the explanations in this book lacking, unlike Kaplan and Powerscore where they give specific reasons to why one shouldn't choose an answer or why one is correct, this guide pretty much seemed very novice. On top of that, there were numerous mistakes and typos where the book would list an answer but then when reading the descriptions for each answer option it would indicate the answer as something completely different. The Logic Game portion of this book is very confusing, it doesn't set up the problems very well.This book isn't a total waste, but the small mistakes here and there were so unnecessary especially when paying attention to detail on the LSAT is imperative. So far Powerscore guides are the best for your money. I suggest if you have a budget stay away from this book."
1,Boooooooooooooooooooooooring,Skip this one or you'll be crying tears of boredom. I'd guess this was just filler material to complete the final season.
4,The Founders Are Sick,"Watching Deep Space Nine for the Dominion War? Then watch this one. I love all the CG they packed in. It's important to the series, and very entertaining. But it still does not have the zing that the last season had. 4.3 Stars on the Trek-O-Meter. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Station Assimilation of Ezri-Dax,"Ezri needs to work things out. So this episode is about how she re-integrates with the main crew. To be honest, I didn't buy it. Although Trill joining can be overwhelming, it always brings a certain amount of confidence that we never get to see from Ezri. A fault on the casting director I think. Pro: Garak. 3.2/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Not bad,"Few gems in here: Elwood Reid, Trey Ellis, and Ron Carlson's contributions stand out for me. The short story format is a good read when you don't have much time."
1,Spiritually Wrong,"Bob:I have news for you, I received it from Rick Warren author of The Purpose Driven Life, ""God is God and you are not!"" I most certainly am not, and I am going to go out on a limb here and state that any ""infinite being"" reading this review is not. I do believe like Mr. Warren that we are in what you call the Human Game for a purpose, but it is not my purpose but God's purpose.I do a lot of reading and hence have suffered many disappointments in books purchased over the years but this is now at the top of my holographic list.I got through half of Chapter 10 when I finally had to put this book in the trash. You are right, this book goes against everything I believe as true. There is no way I could convince myself that I created this physical universe and all it's particles, nor do I have the desire."
3,Goofy book but ...,"I bought this book to share with two friends who have recently gone bankrupt. I don't think they'll get what little message it contains but who knows? The author does make a couple of interesting points and the book may be worth buying if you've never understood the new age stuff about creating your own universe. But you'd get a thousand times more out of a thorough study of a book by Louise Hay or Ekhardt Tolle, without all the hype. Badly written, lots of email pressure to buy further product, very little actual content. His ""process"" is useful but crude. It has been done elsewhere, better.Still, in this greedy world, his title will probably attract quite a few readers. And they might even learn something. Do I believe he is doing this work out of sheer cosmic exuberance and not any desire to make money? No, I don't. Which makes me wonder if he understands his own message."
2,Is Comfort Important To You?,"Like others have said, the idea is the world, including the human experience is holographic. Maybe it's true, maybe it's not. I'd save a lot then expect to lose it over the course of a year or more it would take you to cross the mental point where you 'bust loose' and really convince yourself that life and money aren't real. At the very least, do not owe anyone money. I just could not vibe with this book for long. I'd rather save, invest and get stuff I want.Try the library. I never read it now."
5,Great stuff!,"I love this stuff for a quick lunch, especially handy to keep in the car. I recently bought a case through Amazon, but just found it at my local Aldi's store today for only $1.19 a pack!"
4,Good General History,"There were areas I wish he would have went more in depth with, like how the coffeehouse scene in Holland came into existance and other areas I wasn't as interested in, like hippy pop culture. Also he overemphasizes a lot of things that went on in Britain, which historicly isn't exactly the epicenter for Marijuana activity and culture. The author isn't a stoner, or at least doesn't come off as one, but he seems to be pro-Cannabis at least to the extent of showing the stupidity of the law enforcement witchhunts against what is more or less a harmless ""drug"". Overall a good general history of Cannabis."
4,Great book. Impossible to find.,"Whether its true or not this book was excellent. It seems that all to often the people behind the scenes are forgottten. Perhaps in this case it was the only option, but I always felt bad for the unknown hero. The only other thing I can say is...REPRINT PLEASE!"
5,"Works great, really flexible!","These work really well, you can adjust the position around the eyes to provide maximum protection. You can also adjust the positioning on the ears for maximum comfort."
4,Happy with these glasses,"I'm quite happy with these glasses. They work as advertised. The only drawback is the storage for the lenses is horrible. If the lens case was better, I'd give this product 5 stars."
5,Just What We Need! :-),"I've never been a fan of this show but started watching it on the weekends on ABC Family. I liked it, so i bought the first two seasons on DVD. This show is awesome and I love it! With all the depressing and degrading entertainment out there (but I love horror movies!), this show is exactly what we need -- it's light-hearted and funny. Perfect to watch after a long grueling day at the office or to unwind before bedtime. Besides, Sabrina is cute as hell! :-)"
5,The Linen Closet,"YESSSSSS! Finally. I'm done watching this on ABC Family, I want to OWN it! The second season is definitely the best, and after season 3, the show just goes downhill.. but finally, season 1! Another show to cross off my list. Now all we need is The Wonder Years, Doug, Are You Afraid of the Dark, Rocko's Modern Life.. well, alright, a lot more."
4,Finally This Great Show Comes To DVD,Sabrina Is A Normal 16 Year Old Teenage Girl With One Exception She Is A Witch As Her Father Is A Warlock And Her Mother Is Mortal. She Is Sent To Live With Her 2 Witch Aunts Hilda And Zelda And Their Talkng Pet Cat Salem. She Tries To Keep Her Powers Under Control In The Mortal World But Always Manages To Use Her Powers To Complicate Her Life. It is Entertaining Watching Her Try To get Out Of The Situations She Gets Herself Into. Can't Wait For Future Seasons To Be Released
1,I want my money back!,"I bought this book because I thought it would give me some practical advice about how to improve my fashion sense, but it was a real dissapointment. There are no photos or illustrations as examples of what the authors are talking about. And often I wondered what they were talking about?! This seems to be almost a combination of new age/psychology mumbo jumbo, with topics like ""body talk"" and ""image wounds."" I found the ""icon exercise"" exhausting. And while some sections, like finding good quality fabrics, were helpful there were too few of these to make the book one I could reccomend. The book is also long, and is often a tough read. So even though I'm into style and fashion and buy lots of books in this field, this one is good idea that just doesn't deliver."
5,Violence in America: A Martial Artists Perspective,"If you have never really understood inner city or gang violence, read this book. If you live in the inner city or must deal with gang violence, read this book. If you are prone to pass judgment on inner city youth, read this book. If you want your eyes opened about violence in America and contributing factors to that violence, read this book. If you want to read about a program that works, ...yes, read this book. Geoffrey Canada is a fellow martial artist that is using his skills to make a positive difference in the world. I have tremendous admiration for what he is doing."
4,EASY LISTENING! SO MANY HITS ON ONE DVD! WORTH HAVING!,"It's incredible the harmony the brothers bring with these songs. So many great hits in one DVD. What I don't understand is why so few concerts by these brothers? After viewing this DVD, I wanted to see John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, Staying Alive and Grease! Great music!Thank you!"
3,Somewhat lackluster vocals were the main disappointment,"This live-concert DVD covers the career span of Bee Gees, from their early hits (Massachusetts, I Started a Joke) to the disco hits (Staying Alive, You Should Be Dancing), to the more recent efforts (One, Still Waters). The interesting selections include songs made popular by other artists, such as Our Love (Don't Throw It All Away) by late brother Andy Gibb, Guilty, Heartbreaker, Island in the Stream, etc. The only disappointment I have toward the program is the fact that Barry Gibbs' falsetto has clearly aged and lost its piercing quality. You can really see him strain to hit some of the notes. However, balanced that with the tribute to Andy, and the shots of Olivia Newton-John and her daughter during the song ""Grease,"" this DVD is still worth having for those of us who grew up with ""Saturday Night Fever"" and the Bee Gees music. It brings back happy memory."
2,For Hardcore Fans only!,"The Bee Gees have a great legacy of music, but I purchased this concert in hopes of enjoying the hits from their best album sound track ""Saturday Night Fever"" and their other great 70's hits. Unfortunately, they skirted past most of these hits in favor of songs more popular with their hardcore fans. A big disappointment!"
4,Almost great,"For Bee Gee fans, this is a must have disk. The 3 brothers are there, front and center. Unfortunately, the falsetto or high note that the oldest brother has to hit for many of the songs is hard to do and he fails more often than not. This is not a major problem, as the Bee Gees are basically a harmony-brothers type group, and they achieve harmony on every note. I mention it in passing because purists who are used to studio productions, where acoustics are better and, more importantly, takes and re-takes are possible, might think these songs less than perfect. They are, but that is the trade-off we happily make to see a concert recording with live production."
5,Bee Gees - One night Only - DTS,"WOW! Buy it yesterday! WOW! Some songs brought tears to my eyes! An absolutely amazing performance! The sound and their voices will WOW you! I have the Australia concert (1989) on VHS. This concert features much, much more of Robin's pure honey voice and the awesome voice of Barry! And it's a pure concert without the humor and laughter of the Australia concert. BUY it NOW!!"
5,A great gift for a Bee Gees fan.,I bought this video as a birthday gift for my wife who is a long time Bee Gees fan. It was her fav present and she really enjoys watching/listening to it. It has all her fav songs and sounds great.
4,One Downside Only ...,"This disc is preferable to ""Bee Gees - Live by Request (2001)"", cause there's no irritating MC in it. Good sound (DTS), but the downside is that it's not widescreen."
5,"great sound,great songs, great memories",ITS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ITS BEEN THAT LONG AND FAR BACK TO WHEN I FIRST SAW SATURDAY NITE FEVER BUT I MUST SAY THAT THIS ALBUM BRINGS BACK ALOT OF MEMORIES AND THE BEE GEES SOUND BETTER THAT EVER. I THINK I HAVE JUST ABOUT WORN OUT MY VIDEO AND MIGHT HAVE TO BUY ANOTHER
3,Oh... no!,"I was really expecting more from this DVD! It certainly contains great songs but there are so many BEE GEES GREAT songs that are not on this DVD. If you build collections, then you'll love this DVD but if you think this DVD contains thier biggest hits... look somewhere else!"
4,Get Moving Music,"Bee Gees One Night Only DVD, absolutely fantastic, great oldies, great live performance by all brothers but very sad that Maurice is no longer with us. He was such a gregarious part of the group.A must dvd for anyone who enjoys music from the past 30 years.Sandie"
4,You don't get very much of it.,"The hanging wire is fine and works well. At the time of my purchase, there was no description on the product page of how much wire you get. I'm happy with the product, but disappointed with how little of it you get. Since my purchase, a second photo was added indicating ""9 feet"" on the product packaging."
5,Rumiko's new mermaid legend,"In Japan, it is said that those who eat mermaid's meat become immortal, never be old. The hero ate mermaid's meat some hundreds ago and becomes immortal. He is on the quest of mermaid to ask how to die... Along the journey over many years, he met various people who want to be immortal and those who ate mermaid's meat. Takahashi created a new Japanese legend with original ""unsuccessful mermaid"" monsters and details."
5,Cheese Waffle Crackers,"My brother & I ""lived"" for these in the 1950""sWith his birthday coming up I remembered this product (they use to come in a round tube).Googled it, and here they are !!If you like the old Cheddar Cheese taste, you'll love these.I bought a Case and they went fast. Need to order again...."
4,tight song,Redman is at the top of his game with this song. I love it sooo much. Check it out if haven't already!!
2,rip off or what,I'm a big fan of kareoke but in this compilation im afraid theres nothing in it simple as that. I'd only suggest buying this if your a diehard fan
2,Product NOT recommended,"Griddle cooks very unevenly. I've been making pancakes for my kids for years with griddles that I purchased on sale for about $20. I purchased the broil king thinking I would get a larger, higher quality griddle. Unfortunately, I now have a slightly larger, more expensive griddle that cooks very unevenly. I would not recommend this product."
5,Excellent!,"I didn't think I could get excited over an appliance but this griddle is Excellent! I wish I had spent the extra along time ago! Breakfast is fun again. Pancakes, eggs all cook with such ease. If you are looking for a good griddle then your search is over!!"
1,"OMGoodness, awful","Now we have to find the box it came in. I was so excited to get a good, large griddle. This is not it. It heats so unevenly that the pancakes on the right, near the temperature control are uncooked and the pancakes on the far left burned! Do not buy this!"
1,Not for me,"The high-tech commercial cooking surface began to come off at the third use of this griddle.I don't know what Evenheat means in their product description, but this griddle has a hot spot on the left side.I'm in the market for a new griddle, but I won't buy anything labeled Broilking again."
4,After 4 months of use I'm completely happy.,"After 4 months of regular use, I am still very happy with this griddle. I was originally concerned about some people complaining about a residue build up from the get go. That was people not cleaning the griddle while it was still warm. Clean it while it is warm and cleanup is a snap. I just wipe it with a paper towel and done. I don't care about the rough underside, I don't use that side. I'm happy and I think you will be too, unless you want it to look and feel pretty."
1,lie about it being a professional griddle.,I paid $160 for a home based griddle. The company said it is a professional griddle that is why I bought it. I am very disappointed in this product.. on the instructions it says it is only for home based use.. oh well.. live and learn/
4,You'll Need a Tuner,"The riffs are great for slow blues in G. The explanations about the construction of a blues solo are obviously the voice of experience.I have maybe twenty blues books and this is by far the most practical and can get you playing in a blues jam the fastest.I took away a star because the CD inexplicably is missing the open-string tuning notes so that you can be sure that you are in tune with the band.If you have a tuner, then this should be the book for you. If not, then buy a tuner and get this book."
4,"Great concepts, intermediate to advanced","As many of the other reviews note this text delivers on what it promises, licks for isolated parts of the 12 bar format. There are no tabbed out full solos over 24+ bars so don't expect that. This is a great resource, it is in my opinion though quite difficult. The backing is in a 12/8 type blues so there are endless triplet subdivisions that can make it quite difficult to count rhythm and keep up with the pace and moves that the riffs demand. This becomes substantially easier if you play over the backing track. There are all sorts of riffs in major/ minor/ hybrid pentatonics with different rhythm ideas that really lead to some fresh playing especially if you were like me and tired of going over the same pentatonic ideas and everything was starting to sound the same. I would recommend this to anyone serious about rapidly expanding their understanding and proficiency in playing the blues, you will be able to apply these moves immediately to your playing"
2,Sad,"This show's sooo much fun...this CD doesn't show that. It's an ok CD, I can't simply give it a one because of the sense it's a great production. But with an old fashioned type of singing and style really dragged. The only thing I find unique is the cover! I listen to it hardly ever! I don't suggest this at all! Also, there aren't many songs...the Mathew Broderick one rules like I'm talkin a 6 star! BUY THAT!"
4,Original is often best,"I enjoy this CD very much mainly because I saw this original production. However, rather than recommending the Matthew Broderick version for those who were not satisfied with this CD, I suggest you find the movie sound track. The score is a bit more lush and Michelle Lee is the best Rosemary ever. Her version of ""I Believe in You"" surpasses anyone's. Scott didn't stay in the Broadway show long and was replaced by Lee, I believe. See the movie! The movie soundtrack includes the Coffee Break number, which was filmed for the movie but not used."
4,"solid component, easy to install","I have an older TV with only 2 component inputs. This component does exactly what i needed - so now i can plug in dish receiver, DVD player, Roku box, Wii console all at the same time. Switching is easy, installation was a breeze. Works really well!"
2,Not using it due to 2 major issues,"Can't complain about the delivery or video/audio quality, but unfortunately, it has 2 major issues:1. The unit gets locked every other day and required to be restarted.2. The IR is not working.Since my setup is such that the box is in the basement I can't use it.I won't go down every time I need to switch input nor to restart it.:("
3,hdtv switch,"Product, was priced well, delivery, packaging, quality are good. If you are looking for a switch, because your old one does not switch HD fast enough to preserve synch (you know who you, are IF you have this issue),then this unit is not for you.Otherwise, if you are just switching your component video games from one to another, this switch is fine."
4,It does just what i wanted,"Does everyhting i need it to do, One audio out to my stero and one video out to my projector. The remote is cheap but u can always buy learning remote to learn the ir sensor and just use one universale remote. I use this for my PS3 360 and wii, displays all resolutions. i can not say for the digital audio tho becouse i use and old tube sterio and can only use sterio connection."
3,Kind of Old Fasioned...,"They said you had to be ages 4-8 to enjoy this book. In some ways I disagree. It is so old and involves such a different culture that really, a ten year old would find it ""topping"". This is the first in a series of many and it starts out pretty slow. My suggestion is too skim the first few pages unless you are completely interested in taking a tour of certain parts of Europe. Pretty soon, the story picks up and you can't help but love Joey though there really aren't any main characters. Some interesting and somewhat unpredictible things happen that are totally irrevolent. The main idea of the story is that this English girl decides to start a school in the Tiernees Mountains. Slowly the school poputlation grows and the usual amount of unusual accurences accur. It's a pretty good read, even if you are older than eight!"
1,Needs different narrator,"Sorry, but this audio cd is hard to listen to and follow along because each characters voice sounds the same. I couldn't get through the first cd because I got so confused trying to figure out who was talking. So this review is on the performance rather than content."
5,"Bizarre, hilarious, humorous, wonderful - Buy it.","Wonderfully humorous and hilarious factual account of one of the most bizarre ""weapons"" developed by the United States during WW-II."
4,Seeing Sydney,VERY informative. Perhaps too much info. At times I felt I was overloading. Better to have too much though than not enough. This book eliminates the need for any other.
3,"Wow, what a movie.","Having seen the choppers once and eegah more then a couple times (watch out for snakes!!),I purchased this movie. It sort of drags it feet for about half the movie before it starts picking up. Its not the greatest movie and I have seen worse (Manos:The hands of fate anyone). At times the performances seem a bit wooden and the line deliverances funny. It might be worth a rental."
1,How sad,"WE FEEL SO BAD FOR TERRI'S MOM AND DAD - MICHAEL, NEW BRIDE AND CHILDREN WILL CERTAINLY GET A BUCK OR TWO FROM THIS - SO WILL HIS ATTORNEY."
1,The truth of lies,"Terri: The Truth is an oxymoron. If you look at the depositions in which Michael Schiavo is on record of saying he needed the money to take care of his wife for the rest of her life, yet as soon as he receieved the medical malpractice money, the start to end her life began. Why did Terri go 10+ years with zero rehab of which Michael was awarded that money to rehab her? Why did it take Michael 8+ years to suddenely remember or come out with the notion that ""Terri and he talked about this situation and she didn't want to live this way?"" There are so many holes in his version of the Truth that it really makes you wonder what did happen the night Terri collapsed. ""Terri: The Truth"" is a bunch of lies according to Michael Schiavo's court testimony and what he's saying now. The public records of the trial are better reading than this hogwash. Don't waste your money on a guilty man trying to clear his conscience for murdering his wife."
2,left me tired and exhausted....,"I switched to this from taking stress-b complex, vitamin e, st johns wart, selinium, and omega 3... after 3 days of the ultra preventative i was exhausted all day long and ended up sleeping for over 18 hours in a single day. I immediately stopped these and started back on my normal vitamins and I have recovered. I do not know if these are too strong (some vitamins in this 8 pill/day serving are at 5000% or more maybe way too strong I dont know... moral of the story is be careful with these."
3,Kira The Cardassian,"Kira, a Cardassian? Uh, watch and find out, if you're interested. It was only relevant to anything cause we learn a little bit more about Garak, but that's it. The idea of Kira Nerys as a Cardassian is kinda interesting, but after the first time watching it, you end up playing Tetris on another screen. 3.4/5 Stars. Side note: Great Make-up! These Make-up artists should have been up for an Emmy for the make-up in this Season. Oh, that's right, they DID! AND THEY WON. Congratulations Emmy Winners! You sure deserve an Emmy made of Gold pressed Latinum. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,"Our future, soon to be the past","This is a 2-parter that takes us out of Deep Space Nine and puts us on Earth, in their distant past (and our very soon future?). Not important to any story arc, it's still pretty good Science Fiction as a stand alone Star Trek episode. Problem is that it's too long, and should have been condensed into 1 episode. Good acting and sets though. 3.4/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
3,Doesn't get interesting until 30 min mark,"Garak dissembles so much that I get irritated just like the characters do. When Odo rolls his eyes with impatience, I'm right with him. That was the first 30 minutes of this episode. If you can get through that, the remainder is pretty interesting, enlightening of major events in the story line coming in future episodes."
4,The Hosts of Dax,"A Trill Tale. Jadzia undergoes some kind of ritual to meet her past hosts. For a story like this, it was well written. I was thoroughly entertained by this stand-alone season 3 episode. It doesn't have anything to do with any story arc, but it was fine just the same. Watch this one if you're watching all the good episodes of DS9. 4.0/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
2,For the love of Picard Skip this one,"So in the midst of a war; Sisko grows a goatee and takes a month to build a solar ship out of wood. The ship itself has to be the most ridiculous unbelievable thing to ever come out of any Star Trek episode that I have seen...he builds it all by himself, it runs on solar particles, they feel it tilt when they turn and they use a gyro-meter to navigate (WTF YOU ARE IN SPACE NOT POSSIBLE), and it somehow randomly goes warp speed. Yes that's right a ship built by 1 man with no previous experience was able to handle FTL travel...at the end the Cardassians greet them with fireworks IN SPACE...yea the writing in this one was atrocious. I hate doing this, but this was a chore to watch 1.5 out of 5!"
2,Works great as a chair,"First of all....we bought this at Toys R Us for $39.99! I'm amazed people are paying so much more for it.We got it for my daughter when she was about one and a half. She loves Elmo and we liked that she can push his hand and he talks.I feel that the product description is VERY misleading! It's made to sound as though it spins on its own. It does not! The bottom is slightly rounded so your child can make it spin by using their legs. Even with their legs to power them it more slowly turns than spins.We could never really get it to turn well with the carpet and even at the store on the hard floor. Oh well, we bought it anyway because it talks and she likes Elmo. She loves to drag it around the house and sit in it. So it's a good chair, but there isn't anything special about it.Please don't pay more than $40 for this! It's not worth that much!!!"
4,Fun stuff,"The Morning Shade Mysteries are a chick-lit version of the Mitford series. While billed as mysteries, they're really slice-of-life books with a light, no-harm-done mystery woven through it all. Maude, who's first person narrative marks every other chapter, is a wonderful, realistic woman stuggling with money, her mother in law, and faith. Despite being in a completely different period of life, I really identified with Maude like I haven't with the too-sweet heroines of Christian romance. If you prefer plot-driven books then pass this by, it's not what you're looking for. However if you're in the mood for a light character-driven book that will cause you to laugh, sympathize, and cause you to think about your own daily existance, then pick up this book. You'll like it!"
4,Relaxing mystery,"I have read all three books in this series and personally enjoyed the other two more, but this book is a vital part of the series. There were times I felt that the writer repeated things over and over and over, but I know that when I have a problem in my life, the situation is always on my mind as was the case with the main character. So in that respect the character is very believable."
1,Whiny Women!,"In the guise of being ""folksy"", this book presents some of the whiniest women in literature. They spend an awful lot of time complaining about their not very interesting lives and how the men didn't take care of them. They act like they live in the 1950's and the poor women have to work to earn money. The writing style is actually rather good, the story is just boring and annoying.Read the ""Elm Creek Quilts"" series if you want a good cozy read."
4,good littel camera,I purchased this Camera for work. I use it to document damage or lack of damage to rental equipment. For my application this unit performs great. I have several people that use this camera and have not had any of them asking how to use it.
2,LCD screen broke,"We had our SD200 for about 6 months and kept it in a small camera case. Had lots of fun with it. Somehow the LCD screen (see other reports) broke with just minimal pressure to the camera. When turned on the LCD screen is grey with a purple splotch down the middle. It still takes stills and the movie mode works but you can't adjust the settings without the screen. Frustrated, we just sent it in to Canon. If they charge us to fix it will not pay it, just get another camera that won't break like this."
3,Another broken screen,"This review was written only to tell everyone that the screen is very fragile.I am an extremely careful person and have gone to great lengths to protect the camera. Unfortunately just last week, I became another one of the many disappointed customers to find a broken LCD screen on their SD200.Be careful when buying."
2,Fragile LCD,"LCD screen cracked. I would steer clear of this camera but if you do buy one, make sure you get a really good case. The problem is that having a decent case makes the camera too big for your pocket."
3,Another cracked screen here,"I had it for less than 2 months and the screen was cracked. I've owned an S200 for years without any problems and I switched to SD200 for the movie mode. Many people have the same experience with the LCD screen and it seems to have something to do with the cold weather. I was told that Canon refused to repair them, so I don't know if a class action lawsuit is on the way. I loved this camera when it lasted. Movie mode was fantastic."
4,Just what was wanted,"I was asked to find these caps for a friend, as he used to wear caps that were similar. Now that he has these, you never see him in any other cap."
2,Not worth it,"The adjustment is terrible and overall the jumping rope tangles a lot!! Poorly made, my old jumping rope from a $0.99 cent store was of a better quality."
4,My 2 cents,"Like the reviewers below me said...this book has errors and not enough coverage of certain areas (like the package and deployment wizard). Nevertheless, I found this book helpful and was able to pass the exam on the first try using this book as my primary sournce of information."
3,Kashifu grandbery review,"HI, have you read a book about two .different cultures. My class just read a book called `'CREATIVITY'' BY John Stepoe. What I liked was Hector was from PuertoRico. And Charles But you could have told us more about Puerto Rico. No I would not Recommend because I did not like the book. Kashifu K. Grandberry"
4,Good fun for a party,My girlfriend got this as she enjoys Trivia games.It's excellent background party game.I put it in and let it play at a party at our house. People picked up the remote and answered questions. It was a great ice breaker.
1,What the hell happened?,"The powers that be have ruined Mulberry Lane's music and look. Apparently, the target audience for this band is now 13 year old girls. And oh yeah, why do such beautiful women have to be dressed up like they just walked off a trailer park for the album cover?"
4,A Fresh Outlook,"Along the same lines of two earlier releases, ""Blue Counterpoint"" and ""Suspended Animation,"" Cullen's ""Indigo Blue"" soothes the fingerstyle fan while deftly dodging the cliches of ""newage"" guitar. Anyone ""in the know"" will recognize his influences as they appear on the record--Towner, Metheny, and a heavy dose of blues and soul--add resonance to the tunes. While I might not choose this over ""One Night, One Guitar"" as my introduction to Cullen, if you like Ed Gerhard, Bill Mize, and the better Wil Ackerman stuff, give this album a listen. With a ton of tunes recorded over just a few days at Ackerman's VT studio, this album finds a mellow corner of the listener's mind and makes camp."
4,Valentine Treats,"I did a lot of crafts for my parents and my friends.The book gave me so many ideas and it was explaint so well, great book. plus I didn't really need a lot of money."
2,Not current.,Even thought I knew this was an older book I thought I would learn some things of value especially since it said Second edition and updated. Unfortunately it was still too outdated. Almost nothing on electrics which is probably the most popular now. It also does not go into much detail. I thought I would learn something about Gyro's but very little on that subject and they are still talking about Gyro's with spinning wheels. Also was looking to learn something about building and adjusting but they pretty much say to refer to manufacturer's manual. I think if you're basically into nitro or gas there are some relevant information but that isn't what beginners start with and I would assume by the time you venture in to nitro your too advanced for this beginner's book.
4,Reality bites,Typical of european films Go Now takes a very small slice of life and puts it under a microscope. Here a working class couple are shown dealing-or not-with the everyday issues which arise when he is stricken with ms. The film accuratly reveals the impact of the disease process on every aspect of the couple's life. The acting is powerful and truthful. The subtext reveals the strengths and weaknesses of the human spirit when challenged by life altering circumstances.
1,I hope you all find help,"because if you think this is the way to go, you are truly in need of it. First, a careful reading of the Bible mentions false prophets and such (after end point of the Bible) but otherwise says nothing occurs till time for ""rapture"" and 2nd coming. Unless you want to claim we're in second coming, people who hear from Jesus are either deluded or false prophets. You are free to decide which. On that basis, however, the ideas espoused in the book are either pointless,useless (if delusional), or meant to pull people to the Anti-C if false prophecy. Again, your decision. (Free-will - remember and apply it !!!)"
3,Actually about 3.5 Stars...,"I have done work with ACIM on and off for years... and can understand the lady's comments about ""emotional suicide"". The Course does not address the human condition as well as it does the spiritual.Having said that, ACIM also changed my life at a time when I needed the help. It took me out of victim mode. It showed me that maybe there was another way to look at things... and perhaps it was my ""perception"" rather than what was really going on at the time.So, I did and do find the Course to hold a lot of Wisdom, but as with any text, it's not the ""end all/be all"". I suggest it in conjunction with other self-help books that can, perhaps, give a better picture of life as an emotional being.Thumbs up, and I'll always recommend this book."
4,A practical system of change,"This book offers a complete system for making a change of conciousness in modern age for a modern man.It is practical, step by step manual with theoretical explanations, which gives you perspective for further development. It worked for me as a good starting point and an excellent grounding in pure intuitive knowledge"
1,A Hoax That Can Drive You Crazy!,The logic that this book uses is circular thinking; You first get a sophistry that weaves it's falsity with a thread of intellectual stimulating thoughts. Then you come back to the premise which still intrigues you but has no basis. There are some profound truths sprinkled through out the book in order to entice you into believing all of the lies.
1,Not the same Jesus from the Bible,"A Coures In Miracles was ""channeled"" to Helen and the Bible is clear about what it says about mediums. The Course re-writes Christian doctrine. Lots of it is non-sensical like ""there is no justification for the unjustifiable."" If you read any of it, you will see nothing but contradicitons within its own text. If sin is just an illusion, why does it say ""Sin proves that the Son of God was evil?"" And, if one does not need to forgive anything that God created, why does it require one to forgive a brother? Purchase the ""real"" Word of God called the Holy Bible and don't waste your time on this false text."
4,George Wahsington,"Very interesting facts, story very well written. Really enjoyed reading about one of our founders, who was a great man."
3,"Shortcomings of this book,due to author omissions","I am a Past Master of a Masonic lodge. I know of George Washingtons'history as a Mason, and some of the deeds that he performed as a Mason.His actions and deeds were influenced by his Masonic experiences. Inthis book they even quote a passage from one of his letters which containswording taken directly from Masonic ritual, yet nowhere do they evenmention his Masonic credentials!These historical facts had to have been influenced by his Masonic backgroundand teachings, but that line of experiences is not even mentioned in this book.I tried to contact the author thru the publishers, twice, and have been ignored!It would seem that they have a hidden agendawith regard to some of the historical facts.That causes me to believe, what else did they leave out?????"
1,History revision for secular propaganda purposes,"After reading just the first part of this book, to the point where young George gets his first military command, I cannot read further as it is an obvious revision of history in order to distort the fact that Gorge Washington was a Christian. Despite the fact, proven through numerous documents, and thru Mr. Washington's own writings, that he was a Christian, this book purposely voids all traces of this from this story. Shame on the author for this as the very fact that Mr. Washington was a practicing Christian is a very powerful part of his story. Shame on the author for promoting distorted truths as facts. Shame on the author for declaring his book as ""The Real George Washington"" as it is NOT! I do not recommend this book to anyone.I would have liked to have been warned, before I purchased this book, that it was written by a history revisionist in order to fit current secular humanist religius philosophy."
2,Best Left in the Past (and forgotten),"A temporal link a mathingy .. Seriously, I'm a big Trekkie, and I couldn't get into this episode. Unless you have to see every single one, skip this. It doesn't have anything to do with any other episode really. I was playing Q-Bert on another screen half the time. 2.5/5 Stars. I think this is one of the lowest ratings I've given DS9. ~Keep On Trekkin'"
1,No show.,They DVD's came right away but unfortunately two of them were defective. I returned them free of charge with ease but they were a Christmas Day disapointment.
4,"seriously, the best Trek",Deep serious stories and lots of character development. Watch it if you enjoy the Trek universe. Four more words required.
1,dark borin fast walkin monsta,"Don't add to cart;not worth it, not even to pawn. its not even good enough for the ""ga-bidge""-as my ma anastasia r. l. would say; all u see from start to end is a dum, no purpose, fast-walkin, dark, 1/2 deranged lookin gorilla monster in the dark w/ i think no action-barely. i think someone bought it from a grocer store & sold it. though ive never seen this (show? b/4 now),unfortunately i got it-got it bad. whats worse is durin an xtreme lightning storm i had to xtra convince the garbage to take it since the garbidge was full."
5,David Cullen: Does it all!,"""One Night One Guitar"" by David Cullen displays his formidable talent in both the classical and jazz guitar worlds. David seamlessly blends classical technique with pop and jazz sensibilities, and makes it sound so relaxed. This is a live recording and it sounds as if David were sitting in your living room with you. The recording and performance are flawless and yet the songs remain comfortable and relaxed. David performs original, jazz and classical compositions on this disc. Original pieces Blue Counterpoint and On the Way are refreshing and uplifting. David's arrangememnts of Birdland and Spain are funky and exctiting and his performance of Bach's 6th Cello Suite is also dynamic and expressive. If you like great fingerstyle guitar (and everything in between), David Cullen delivers it all with taste and great technique!"
4,Great Garment Bag,"This bag is far superior to the others I have used. The patented clasp holds my hangers in place, and so my clothes don't fall off the hangers. I only wish they still made the 52"" blue one with a shoulder strap. Then I would not have to fold my slacks across a hanger. Well worth the price."
3,The Most Beautiful Villages in England,Non of these villages are very beautiful to me.But then beauty is in the eyes of the beholder.
2,Villages = churches,"This book could well be called ""Churches in the Villages of England."" Of the two or three photographs per village, one or two are of the local church. Interesting as these may be, I was looking for pictures of the houses, streets, and squares of the villages, as well as the countryside that surrounds them."
1,invention of sewingmachine,Very. Dry reading....I was looking for information on sewing machines and I. Had to really dig through the info and do my own highlite to get what I wanted..sure glad this was a free book.
5,Easy Christmas Fake Book,This is a very useful item with the upcoming Christmas season. I never knew such a book existed and was delighted to find it on Amazon!
3,Way too easy!,This is not a book for the experienced Sudoku fan. The puzzles are very easy. The only difficult ones are the mega puzzles & they are very difficult. I'm still looking for the best way to solve such a large puzzle.
1,Ultimate?!?,"Ok, so this is the ""Ultimate Sudoku Challenge"" in whose universe????A complete waste of money for anyone who is looking for a challenge, and too much money to pay for the 25x25 grid puzzles at the end which are just annoying ( Unless you enjoy doing your puzzles through a magnifying glass )"
2,HORRIBLE!,"We purchased this slide for our 7-year-old son last April (2008) and have had to patch it 4 times, sew several seems, and today during normal play a HUGE hole blew out of it!!! I do not recommend this product to anyone!"
1,bad bad bad,This was my second water slide and it lasted about a month being very careful with it and following all instuctions it still riped down the side the same as the first one I bought. You will not get a replacement or your money back even if you buy the 2 year warenty . I just want everyone to know what you are getting into when you buy this product I personally dont know anyone who has purchased a banzai slide that has lasted more than one summer.
1,BEWARE-DESIGN FLAW AT BOTTOM OF SLIDE,"I purchased this slide at Target on sale for $400. It was a great slide for my kids the first 2 months, then a leak sprang. No big deal as I patched it up with the kit provided. Then soon after a tear in the seam occurred at the wall near the bottom of the slide. What happens is when the kids slide down at a good rate of speed, they first brush/hit the wall on their left as they enter the splash pool. After constant hitting every time the kids go down the slide, it ripped the seams apart and is unpatchable. I am trying to get Banzai to help me out on this, but their warranty is only for 60 days, and mine only lasted 90. I have seen many others out there post similar concerns, and I had only wished I read them before I purchased it."
3,Just...okay,"I bought this book a few years ago, just because I was trying to adapt a more healthy lifestyle, and for the immense amount of recipes in the book (a lot!).I really don't see how Christina could have possibly tried all of these recipes! The several that I've tried have seemed relatively tasteless and almost inedible! The only reason why I'm giving it 3 stars is because the entire beginning section has some wonderful explanations on macrobiotics and a glossary of some different ingredients that most cooks wouldn't know on their own.As for the recipes, I can honestly say that in my ever growing repertoire of vegan cookbooks, I very rarely refer to this one. If you're looking to go macrobiotic, maybe it would be useful, but if you're a vegan/vegetarian looking at this book because of the number of recipes....don't bother."
4,Motown's Greatest Book,This book is great if your a musician like myself.It has all my favorites and it's great to have the words to some of the best songs recorded ever.I loved it and recommend it to any mucian looking for Motown material.
2,missing pages,"Several pages were missing from this book. Unfortunately for me, these were some of the songs that inclined me to make the purchase in the first place."
3,Mostly theory..,"This is my first book in the dummies series.I being a technical guy, expected more working examples with explanation.But it is mostly theoretical. The case studies made interesting reading. This book will be suited for managers than technical persons."
2,Not really worth the trouble,Not really worth the time to read (let alone the expense). Covers the basics but not well enough to make a lasting impression and is somewhat miss guided towards a vendors rather than practitioners view of Service-oriented Architecture.I have found more useful information free on the web - just started out with Wikipedia and went from there.
1,Ground breaking,"Or is that rock breaking!!! You'll see what I mean if you waste your time with this one. 90 minutes of two guys in their pyjamas carrying rocks back and forth from one pile to another. The symbolism wasn't lost on me, I recognised it for what it was, rubbish. It was a relief when the lead characted met his fate."
2,Disapointing,"The story of the persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany is one that deserves to be told. It is a pity then that this attempt falls flat with its inability to decide whether it wishes to be a movie or merely a filmed play.Self-consciously stagy, burdened with a tedious, over bearing avant-garde wannabe of a score, and saddled with a script devoid of any nuances, subtleties, or refinement, the film works only as a vehicle that will play only to those already aware of this aspect of this devastating chapter in human history.Nice try. Better luck next time."
3,FYI - Don't buy this movie for Jude Law,"Notwithstanding that this was a pretty good movie, and at the risk of looking like an idiot for buying a movie just because it was listed in Jude Law's filmography, I wanted to caution anyone else who may be looking for the earlier Jude pix... So definitely rent before you buy with this one."
3,A decent biography.,"This is a decent biography on Prince Leopold, although the author's theories on how he contracted hemophilia through his mother Queen Victoria was a little over my head, and the author could have made her explanation a bit more clearer. Also, I do wish the author would have made a family tree of Prince Leopold's descendents."
1,Mind-numbing Repitition,"Why, oh why, did I keep listening to this? The wooden characters would all do something, then think about what just happened, and then tell someone what just happened - using the same words each time does wonders for memorizing the story, but little for the craft of story telling. And, the pedantic use of the full title and name of the list of conspirators - every time they were mentioned - was outright painful. It felt like the story was written for people with no memory of what just happened."
1,Don't Waste Your Time with This Book !,I went into this book based solely on the description on the dust jacket. Big mistake! After about 20 pages it became painfully clear that the writer lacked any imagination and his writing any originality. The book read like a cliche festival but I had hopes that the plot line would improve and the pace pick up. No such luck. After clawing my way thru about a quarter of the book I gave up. The characters are so unbelievable that it simply wasn't worth going any futher. With writing this bad you don't care how the story ends or what happens to the characters.
5,Best Author.,Anything by this author is worth reading. This is his latest addition to his writings and it does not disappoint. I also suggest going back to his first books and reading them as well.
2,Hard to finish,"I have to agree with the reviewers who were less than happy with this book. I gave the book two stars instead of one because the idea was good - people in positions of high power run amok - but it was poorly executed. I think Mr. Folsom's editor didn't do him any favors. The book probably would have been good had it been pared down by about 150 pages or so, and the editing stinks. I finished the book, but only out of sheer will power. Spend your money elsewhere. For sure, wait for the paperback version."
2,ARGH! Not the follow-on The Exile deserved,"I really liked The Exile. This book stinks. You ought to read the original which he tried to emulate: Seven Days in May, by Fletcher Knebel and Charles Bailey. Now that was a classic! This book isn't. I never did get the connection between all the elements and if you read the book you will see what I mean. I also found myself skimming long passages that related to nothing except more pages."
5,brother mfc4600,This is a great machine for small home office. The letters are good quality; I didn't need color. I have had it for over 6 months and all the faxes have gone through and come in without a problem. Toner easy to change.
2,"Looking for inkjet canvas, look elsewhere","I was looking for 13X19 cut sheets of canvas to put through my Canon i9900. I tried 3 different brands. Pictorico from Adorama here through Amazon, also Inkpress and Legion, both from B & H. The Pictorico was so thin, I could see right through it, before and after I had printed on it. This is not a canvas that can be stretched, or mounted to a board without showing its nasty back. The Inkpress had a wheat color back and was heavy. Unfortunately, it curled after printing and even more after sealing and glazing. I doubt that it will adhere to anything, but will probably stand up to stretching over stretcher boards. The Legion was by far the winner for me. It printed true, is a good weight for mounting or stretching, and the colors were rendered nicely. Given the small universe for cut sheet inkjet canvas, I hope this helps. BTW, the Pictorico was by far the most expensive of the three."
1,lost in the mail,"I still have not received this book. My class started on the 29th of AUG, i am in Iraq, and i still do not have a book for class. My wife had to buy it from another location and she scans copies and sends them to me. I looked into requesting a refund, but there were no procedures to follow for 'Not delivered""."
3,Literature Book,"The book had lots of writing and markings in it, lots of bent pages. It was also not the right edition, but I guess thats ok I just had to find the pages we were on."
2,"Literature: Reading Fiction, Poetry, and Drama","The book is old, but it is fine to read.The pages are highlighted many. Would be better to indicate prior selling so people know"
4,A great backyard toy!,I bought this for our 4 1/2 yr old daughter and her friends and it gets played with all the time! It is very durable and it's very easy to unfold and fold up to store! I would recommend this toy playhut to anyone! I just wish we had boughten it earlier! A great product!
1,He should have been hanged,Kurt was a committed ss nazi his war crimes with the hitler youth division were sickening He attempted to defend the SS in his book but forgot about Himmler and the 6 million Jews killed in his SS concentration camps
1,Disappointed,"The arrangements in this book may be relatively easy, but they aren't very interesting and aren't much fun to play. I just got started with finger picking. A little more creative arrangements might be more difficult to learn, but the effort would seem worthwhile. These tunes reminded me of the songs you would find in the old Mel Bay beginning guitar series, arranged to throw in a few bass notes. I hoped to find easy listening Beatles tunes that would be entertaining. I was disappointed."
5,A must have soundtrack!,"If the movie is half as good as this wonderful soundtrack, Small Planet Pictures will have a timeless classic on their hands. With three enchanting songs by Claire Voyant, two deep and sexy songs from Karen Black, a brilliant remake of Stevie Nicks' ""Talk to Me"" by Diva Destruction, the Cure's ""Doing the Unstuck"" and Bauhaus' ""Severance"" as well as Velvet Acid Christ, Apoptygma Berzerk, Magenta, Mechanical Cabaret and Sara Rue putting in some of their finest work, this is a ""must have"" for any serious compilation or motion picture soundtrack lover. Claire Voyant, by the way, OWNS this soundtrack. Wow! Victoria Lloyd--what a voice! I cannot wait to hear more from her and her crew: Chris Ross and Ben Fargen. Definitely a band to watch and listen out for!"
2,too much ink,"this machine uses small cartridges and runs out of ink very frequently,it may print fast but you make up for it driving to the office supply store once a week for more ink!!!!"
3,Southwestern Bell S60190 Ringer/Flasher,"The looks of the unit suggest that it has a large easily visible light. Actually, it is a puny small lamp which is just visible in the large 'window'. However, the buzzer is loud and adequate. It is still a reasonable value, considering that a similar looking device from other sources found on the web cost twice as much or more.The last comment was an error. The unit caused an error/short in the phone system which required a phone company repairman to come out and locate the short. The visible ringer. - Disconnected and junked within 2 months of connecting it."
1,Horrible version of a great documentary,"When I ordered this from PBS on VHS years ago it was 2 hours and 6 minutes and I watched it over and over again, one of the best Hollywood documentaries I had ever seen.This DVD version is 40 MINUTES SHORTER !!!What a rip-off...save your money and buy the VHS, hopefully THAT hasn't been demolished in recent years."
1,I'm not a prude but...,"I'm not sure that The Confessions of Aubrey Beardsley was based on his life at all. Written in the form of a pseudo autobiography by Beardsley, it includes descriptions of Aubrey Beardsley the child being molested by an elderly patron of the arts and having sex with the family maid. And the story line progresses in much the same way through his adult hood.This book is so crammed with smut. I'm sure if half this stuff were true I would have read about it elsewhere. Its not like the sex stuff is likely to be left out of a biography. I want footnotes!!!Basically The Confessions of Aubrey Beardsley is a collection of smut tied to a famous person's name. Avoid it at all costs. Since Bearsley looked to the 1700's as the peak of aesthetic taste, follow his lead and start with the Marquise de Sade. Or just find a newsgroup that caters to you.Gack!! I wasted my time here."
1,useless,"This product doesn't work. I plugged it into my car cigarette lighter and plunged in a USB device and the thing started smoking. I literally had to pull it out for fear that it was going to catch fire to my car. My car is a Toyota so its not even like it has super powerful outlets in it. This is simply a crap device.On the flip side, the seller was great. He refunded my money and I had no problems with him."
1,Born Losers - The Title Tells It All,"Oh....my....God. What a horrible movie. I am a big fan of Billy Jack, Chuck Norris and other ""B"" movie genre, but this was too bad even for me. Even taking account of the decade it was made, this movie is too bad for words. It's too bad to be amusing. Next to this movie, Billy Jack is Oscar-material. I didn't even know this movie existed until I bought the boxed collection! Save your money and avoid it!"
2,Agents land on planet Earth,"Saw the tail end of this Maryland band's performance at the Chili cookoff. I really liked the energy of the band on stage. The sound isn't anything new, but this cd has a couple catchy songs. Overall this studio recording is average at best. The instrumentation on most of the tracks is tight, especially the drums. There is something extremely annoying about the lead singer's vocals. The band's songwriting skills are what turned me off the most. Did you guys get your song writing inspiration from Dr. Seuss? If you like the overly processed, guitar driven (not like Cream or Black Sabbath), rock of today (a la Linkin Park, Good Charlotte, Incubus, Deftones etc.), pick up this cd."
5,Captain from Castile,I am a Tyrone Power fan and love to be able to find his movies on DVD. This was a favorite of mine that I haven't seen available before.
3,Is it the same formula?,"I finished off my old can purchased at a store and ordered a large can, but I find the taste is not as distinctly vanilla. The powder does dissolve easily in oatmeal and smooties which is how I use it."
4,Dissolves and mixes well,I've only used a few different protein powders over the years but dissolving and mixing in well seems to be a problem with most. This powder dissolves very well if stirred in kind of vigorously and any big lumps crushed with a spoon then left to sit a few minutes and stirred again well. I don't recall any protein powder dissolving so easily.The Natural has a pleasant mild vanilla flavor. I don't think it has any sweetner but the vanilla gives it a little sweetness. It tastes good in milk and I've been told it's not bad in orange juice.
2,"Label Confusing, Misleading","I found the label confusing because it states ""100% Whey Protein"" in bold lettering.However, what the ""100%"" refers to ""Contains 100 % pure Ultra-Filtered/Micro-Filtered (UF/MF) Whey Protein Isolate""Yes, it ""contains"" 100% pure whey, but from the way the label reads, it sounds as though the product is ALL 100% whey. It is not. It contains soy. It also contains milk, flavoring, and zanthan gum.That said, for those who can tolerate the ingredients (I could not and had to return mine), you may find this to be a good product. Just know that you need to read the fine print."
2,Too many Carbs,"I don't like it because you have to take TWO scoops into one serving, and two scoops has 6g of sugar, 8g of carbs, and only 20g of protein.The taste is ok, I mix it in water, but don't even try mixing with a spoon or you'll be there all day.I mix it in water and a few ice cubes using the magic bullet (blender) in the mornings or after a heavy workout.There are other shakes out there that I have used with less carbs and more proteins, more expensive than this, but I will be going back to it as now I know that this BioChem is not what I am looking for in a whey protein shake."
5,Best supplement I've used,I've tried multiple protein powders and this one is the absolute best value for the money and the flavor ROCKS
3,Complete Billy Jack,My husband and I found that the last 2 dics in the series was the best in the collection. I never knew that their was a collection I only knew about Billy Jack. I found it interesting what Billy Jack went through to save to school and for the kids.
1,What a bunch of idiots,"My interest in this goes back to the Born Losers. The story, the music, right v. wrong, good v. evil, nostalgia. Unfortunately, this set goes down hill from there (and it goes down fast). I have just finished watching the third in the series (The Trial ... ). I don't know if I can stand much more. Almost everything about these movies are rediculous: writing, acting, editing, music (other than Born Losers), etc. Sound is so bad as to be unintelligible during much of ""The Trial ..."" I am not sure hearing and understanding the dialog would have been better. My guess is, no. Closed captioning is not even an option. Check out the Laughlin's web site to discover that after 30+ years they are still a bunch of nuts.I agree with Mr. Chubo's review, except that he may be a bit too generous with his two-star rating."
3,too boring for me,"This book is great if you don't like seasoning on your food and if you have a whole foods store by you, which I don't. There are a few things I'll take from the book but probably won't use it much."
4,excellent up-to-date summary,"Much in the manner of an earlier offering from Jonathan Sumption, Costen supplies with a concise and up-to-date summary of the origins and effects of the Albigensian crusade. Those looking for romance and fancy should perhaps look elsewhere, but for anyone wishing to develop their interest in this fascinating episode could do much worse than buy this book."
4,Great Laughs!,"I think Jenny is a hoot and a half. Over the years she's never really hit the right vehicle for her unique talent (OK, ""Playboy"" aside). I can't believe they've not found a sitcom that would work for her. All that sexuality and beauty, and then she twists it into a pretzel with humor and not taking herself seriously. She definite has found a niche with her writings. I had to talk my wife into this one. She's normally all mysteries, but she wasn't disappointed and broke up with laughter. OK, no nudity for us guys, and some of the jokes at our expense, so minus one star! Big deal. Make your life a bit more enjoyable one evening with this good read."
4,Keeps Getting Better....,"This is the third book of Jenny's that I've read and I still loved it! This book was great! It still has the same humor and laugh out loud moments but it's interesting to hear her views on other topics other than motherhood, In it she talks about the struggles with her marraige falling apart, the beggining stages of autisim, and getting back in the dating world. I always look forward to McCaarthy's books...and I haven't been dissapointed yet."
5,Wonderful and heartelt,She did it again.. she made me sit up and take notice.. I loved it and I thought it was brave of her to open up. I am sending Belly Laughs and Baby Laughs to my best friend.. she can get her own Life Laughs!! I always feel that I am reading my own stories when I read her books.. I have a 4 year old and have been through a divorce.. God Bless You Jenny!
2,Not Necessary,"Compared to the first two ""laughs"" this book was not necessary. I enjoyed a few chapters but overall her material is all fluff. Needless to say Life Laughs did not meet my expectations. I agree with some of the reviews... Jenny can do better than this!"
2,OK,This book wasn't quite as funny as I thought it would be but I still enjoyed it! It's pretty short too!
1,Broke,"We bought this faucet in the summer of 2009, the handle its loose now, and hard to use. It gets little wear, we installed it in my grandma's house, and she is the only one to use it 99% of the time."
5,A wealth of sonnets,"First published in 1929, the book of sonnet sequences by Houston Peterson contains nearly 1000 sonnets by some of the best writers in the form. The Rossetti's, Millay, Shakespeare, Browning, Donne, etc. as well as some of the more obscure and little read poets. It is an excellent reference book on the form."
5,Utter Pleasure,All Opeth releases are classic. This one is just gorgeous!Stripped down acoustic with some synths (a first). Don't know why the masses are listening to Linkin Park while this creative energy is around. Do not hesitate to buy! HIGHLY recommended!!
2,Forgettable,"Opeth are a great band but this album is just forgettable. The songwriting is terribly simplistic and not progressive at all. Some songs have catchy melodies like ""In My Time Of Need"" or ""Hope Leaves"" but after the 10th listen you'll be bored to death by even those. This is more in the vein of Nick Drake, Sting and Neil Diamond than progressive-rock/metal. Nothing wrong with that if it wouldn't go under the moniker of a band who gave us prog-tastic masterpieces like ""Still Life"", ""Morningrise"" and ""Blackwater Park""."
1,They should remaster it !,How could you watch movies that are not remasterized and with a so bad quality ?
5,Definitely a keeper,"To a die hard Chanel fan, this may seem a rudimentary account of Gabrielle Chanel's accomplishments. However, there is no discounting the concise yet impactful way the information is presented to the reader. Baudot is not afraid to acknowledge the evolution of the CHANEL name to the entity known today,the most viable independent fashion house of this century. She discreetly recognizes Karl Lagerfeld for breathing new life into Gabrielle Chanel's classic designs.The magnificent photos and drawings are reflective of this progression and provide the reader with a visual timeline.As with the entire ""Universe of Fashion"" series, this book is definitely a keeper. These books make a great addition to any fashionphile's library."
3,This book is a good introduction to pharmacology,"This book is a good introduction to pharmacology ... well that is if you can see through all the miscalculations that the author's make when converting from the metric system to other measuring systems. For instance: the authors claim that 44 pounds divided by 2.2 equals approximately 21 when the correct answer is exactly 20 (question 3 - 27). In the back of the book the author's claim that 1 grain equals 60 mg which is correct but then it gets interesting, they claim that 15 grains only equals 900 mg when the correct answer is 15 x 60 mg = 1000 mg. They even claim that 1 gram equals 900 miligrams - anybody in Europe know that the correct answer is 1000 miligrams. Math must not be the author's best feature."
4,Great soundtrack for the fall,"This is the first Ladybug Transistor album that I have heard, so I can't compare it with any earlier releases. With that said, I think it's good. Track 5 ""Choking on Air"" is by far my favorite song off this album. Its a very visual song (if that makes any sense) but I think you have to hear it to understand.If you are not familiar with this band, I would compare it to Belle & Sebastian's newest record ""Dear Catastrophe Waitress"" - both have a variety of singers (both male and female) with that sunny 70's AM rock feel. I really love Sasha Bell's voice, so I'm also planning on getting Essex Green's ""Long Goodbye"" to hear her contributions to that cd.I rated this CD 4 stars out of 5 because I enjoy it and it definately has many strong songs, but there are a few songs that I'm not entirely fond of. Still, 4 out of 5 is good!"
4,Just what I needed,"I bought this to fix my extinsion pole. I hit something and broke the spring loaded pin locking mechanism. I used a skinny punch to remove the old pin and broken lever and put the new one on in a jiffy, it worked great. I haven't need the threaded part that was included so no info on that."
5,Totally Sturdy!!! And NO MOLD YAY,"Been in the busiest bathroom for over 2 years and no mold, very sturdy, none of those little holes at the top tearing I LOVE this curtain."
5,Beautiful and Classy!,"I thought all shower curtains were made the same. I was wrong! The Croscill Fabric Shower curtain liner is a class act: beautifully designed, sturdy, water-resistant, and classy. I'm so happy I bought it. And, it's a great deal, too!"
1,Horrible!,"Curtanus Horribilis. I can't believe I'm bothering to write a review of a shower curtain, but this is NOT waterproof. Croscill's quality went leaky along with the economy. They used to make a great product. Now, the liner absorbs water and leaks like a seave. It allows water to go everywhere and will not protect your real shower curtain, much less work alone. It's so cheap, it floats! What a change for the worse. From a reliable liner to a fakey striped thing with poor performance. Spare yourself the aggravation."
4,Works great,All the previous curtains got ruined by the steam in few months. This one seems to last longer; it's well built.
5,very nice.,"I do not know why I didn't buy one sooner, and be right of the plastic. this compliments my shower curtain well. It is a little long, that' s ok. I also like how much more light is in my shower since thinner then plastic."
4,Croscill Fabric Shower Curtain,Works well and so far no leak through. Water beads up and a quick shake at the end of your shower will help with drying time.You do have to keep the bottom of the curtain tucked into the tub. Only complaint is that the fold marks will not go away even after washing it.
2,Wrap-around shower curtain,"This curtain is allegedly weighted at the bottom, but you couldn't tell by the way it billows into the shower stall and wraps around you. Otherwise it's fine but this problem renders it sort of useless for me."
3,Interesting Facts on a Lot of Taboo Topics,"Learn many interesting facts about many socially taboo topics such as human waste, what happens to dead bodies, why humans pass wind and a heap of other stuff from a professor who has 'Honey I Shrunk the Kids' style shrunk himself so he can explore a human body.This is a rather large book with many British style illustrations and British slang. The only thing I didn't like was that some of the smaller illustrations are repeated over and over again, surely they could have drawn a few more different ones in those cases. A very good book and one of the better of this type of genre. Other leaders of this type of education and facts laid out in a fun way which you should read are Shocking Science by John Kelly, Horrible Histories the Wicked History of the World by Terry Deary & Martin Brown, Great Myth Conceptions, Dr Karl Kruszelnicki and It's Disgusting and We Ate It!"
5,Shadow Man is a great read,"This is well written, funny, and pulls you right into the story from the first page. The American Indian lore adds to the fullness of this book as do the 2 elderly lady characters. You have to love those 2!"
5,Jewel Kingdom Delight,My daughter loved the video. She has all twelve of the books in the series and couldn't wait to see the movie. The values and lessons in the story are just another way to re-enforce positive behavior. I would buy all of them if there were more!
4,Worth watching....,"We rented this video from the public library and my 3 and 5 year old girls couldn't get enough of it. It is certainly geared toward the female crowd though with princesses, jewels, and some sentimental singing. And it's a little corny for the parents to sit through too, some really low budget special effects and makeup, but overall it was a good family show. We can't wait for them to come out with another episode. A brief synopsis; The Princess Roxanne and her three sisters are about to go through the coronation ceremony when Roxanne decides she's not ready to rule the Red Mountains and runs away. Out on her own she runs into the Darklings, evil creatures who want to rule the Jewel Kingdom, and they steal her magic ruby pendent. She also befriends Hapgood the Dragon and two jewelers from the Red Mountains who show her what it means to be a real princess. In the end the rag tag group uncover the Darkling plot, rush back to the palace and save the day!"
2,Misjudged the size,"There was nothing wrong with this item. It was to be a gift, but when I saw the size I realized that it was too big for a petite gal. It arrived promptly and was refunded without a hitch."
1,1st Star Wars related thing I didn't realy care for.,"This was really bad. I had to force myself to finish the first ""feature film."" I now realize why this only lasted a short time. There was really no point. Compared to the Clone Wars this was bantha poodoo."
4,Dickens!,What's there really to say? It was as wonderful as every time I've read or watched an adaptation. Dickens rocks!
1,Picture of paper shredder is not the same one I got,When I received my paper shredder PS60-2 I thought it was the same one that is pictured next to their description. How wrong I was. If I knew it wasn't the same as the picture I would not have gotten it. Buyer beware. They show you one thing and sneak a second one in. Amazon isn't what I thought it was
1,Why Was This Trite And Unremarkable Book Published?,"This was a bad read; the plot is an old one and the author did not do it justice. I found it boring which, for a horror story, is unforgiveable. I have read two other books by this author that I liked a lot but this one was amateurish. It simply does not hold the readers interest and there is no one to root for or- for that matter - to identify with. It's odd that the authors other books could be so good and this one so bad."
2,Lack of credibility,"Apart from the detailed accounts of V weapon launch site, the book contains mostly circumstantial evidence and a staggering number of assumptions especially in the use of rare materials. It lacks credibility in the key areas particularly uncorroborated evidence of nuclear tests by the Japanese & the Germans. Credibility is also lost when the author starts discussing Nazi UFOs & underground power plants running for 50 years. There is too much rehashing of information from previous books & not enough following up on interesting leads, this book will be improved by reworking for a second edition.As well as the lack of follow up on some sources, there are important additional sources that the author has omitted. At least one & possibly two, He177 bombers were modified to carry a large single bomb."
4,Gorgeous and Quiet.,"The product is well made, really pretty on our dresser and totally quiet. We are very happy with it. The ONLY thing that could make it better is if it had an intermittant setting. It can only be ""on"" or ""off"" and if it had a setting where it turned itself on and off periodically, it would be ideal. We just let ours run unless we are taking watches in or out, and that works just as well."
4,This has become my favorite translation,"Monsignor Ronald Knox gave us an elegant translation of the New Testamaent but he was careful not to add his own spin to it. He didn't try to make the Bible hip and he didn't use colloquial language. He does however give us a translation that is highly readable. You may pick this translation up expecting to read a few verses and then put it down until tomorrow but you will probably find it so engrossing that you'll keep on reading. My only small complaints are that it would've been nice to have at least a little paragraph in the preface talking about Ronald Knox and how he came to this great work (I suspect that he probably out of modesty didn't want anything about himself mentioned) and that the reprint could've been in bigger or at least clearer text. Otherwise, it's perfect. If you don't want to haul your big ole Douay Rheims around this New Testament is ideal."
2,below average voice and interpretation; admirable program,"Pilgrim's voice is without expression or feeling, and unfortunately, is with excessive and unstable vibrato. The selections are wide-ranged and interesting. The program has great potential as a comprehensive resource, but it's vocal performance lacks talent, technique, and interpretation."
4,Only one sheet of foil,i bought this thinking that it would have at lest 4 sheets of foil paper but it only has 1 sheet.
3,Hebrew for babies,"This is a nice video - similar to the Baby Einstein series of videos for babies. However, there is one HUGE flaw - Latin letters! They have Hebrew letters on the box and in the picture but on the screen, each Hebrew word they show is in Latin letters. I was VERY disappointed as we are raising our daughter bilingually and thought this would be a great introduction to hearing and seeing Hebrew."
4,Good Early B.B. King,"A really good album. Love the orchestra and horns. If you're a casual listener of B.B. King, looking for hits or just want his straight forward blues you should look elsewhere. I'm a diehard fan and collector of B.B. and think this album is a good addition to my collection. ""Every Day I Have The Blues"" with the Count Basie Orchestra is definitely a stand out. I also enjoy ""Sweet Thing"" and ""I've Got Papers on You Baby."" It seems with this album B.B. King's management was trying to give him more of a poppy sound, maybe to bring in more white listeners."
3,Got Alternate Tuning?,"I specifically chose this DVD because I know that Chris Proctor is one of the few people who looks at the 12-string as a unique instrument. By this I mean that he goes beyond the approach of playing ""songs that sound good on a 12-string"" to look at techniques that you can only use on a 12-string guitar.My disappointment is that the DVD focuses only on material with alternate tunings. As a player who has started later in life, I just don't have the time or energy to focus on anything but standard tuning. Unfortunately this leaves little concrete material to make use of.For players who are comfortable with alternate tunings and own a 12-string, this is your DVD!"
5,Scrambled eggs and British agents,"Look, I love Maugham's writing style and I enjoy historical novels. This one was a no-brainer for me.Just read it. It's worth it for the brilliant description of his failed affair with the Russian. Who would have thought scrambled eggs could be such a political statement?"
4,portrait of a genius,"Just a quick review to say that seeing Deller discuss counter-tenors and his voice is new to me and therefore very interesting for me. I knew he was an essential figure in the development of contemporay counter-tenors and the early music movement, but I didn't know how courageous, intelligent and modest he was. He gives a clear idea of how he thought and acted to develop his new ideas, physical and mental. Then he demonstrates his ability and judgment.The documentary may be regrettably short but I don't know of any others about him, and the CD is a beautiful demonstration of his talent."
3,BEAUTIFUL TRANSFER,"The disc looks crisp, like a movie made a few years ago. I hated the story, it seemed like everyone was having a good time making this none sense."
3,Post-Rock 30 Years Too Early,"Although in many ways dated, this completely atypical manifestation of Manfred Mann does anticipate '90s epiphanal freakouts from the likes of Spiritualized and the Verve. It's let down, I would say, by Mike Hugg's rather duff vocals (no Richard Ashcroft, or even Bobby Gillespie, he), but, like many similar records of the time, it does at least attempt to build bridges between different musics. Primary in the latter is the free jazz feeling of the horn section (arranged by Mike Gibbs), particularly the completely wigged-out alto playing of New Zealander Bernie Living, a regular on the avant-garde Brit jazz scene at the time (with Mike Westbrook and others) but who seems to have vanished completely from the early '70s onwards. Anyone know what happened to him? Reference for youth: ""One Way Glass"" could have come off the last Primal Scream album."
5,An excellent introductory text.,"I used this text as a primary text in a high school course in Christology successfully by helping the students along in their comprehension of some concepts. It is a good text for those who are serious about their studies. Generally I'd recommend it for college level readers or beyond, but with the right mix it works at senior high level"
4,From a liberal's viewpoint,"My personal theology is considerably more liberal than Dr. Brown's. Nevertheless, I think that he does a good job of explaining what many Christians believe about the divinity of Jesus and why. I also believe that his scholarship is thourough and honest, albeit not always impartial. But then again, I doubt that anyone's scholarship is totally impartial."
3,unfortunate choice,"I bought this tape for my 7 year old daughter. You may argue that the tape is designed for younger children.The pictures, music and voice are good, but in my view, there are too many isolated words, not enough short sentences to get the feeling of the melody of the language. Practically no situations involving ""I"" (only ""he"" or ""she""). My most serious complaint is that the authors chose to exclude the Greek alphabet; you may like having the approximate phonetic trancription, but the original Greek aspect of the word should have been shown next to it, or at the very least in the printed text that comes with the video."
3,State your point and move on already,I stopped reading this book fifty pages into it. The book is very repetitive. I'm having a hard time getting motivated to pick it up again.
5,Great camera,"The other reviews were very helpful. We really like this camera. Almost no artifacts on HQ mode. Video is a little noisy in low light, but gorgeous in brightly lit settings. Colors are rich and very saturated. It is better than I expected from all the reviews. Much better than having to use DV tapes again."
5,very awesome,"For those of you who enjoyed Slumber Party/Sorority House Massacre, this film is perfect .... hot girls, cool kills, horror greats Reggie Bannister & Linnea Quigley .... Spring Break Massacre is one very awesome movie!"
2,Not worth it,"I've had it for several years of light use. Shorly after purchase the light/receiver that enable the auto-feed stopped working. I manually used the ON rocker switch instead. Now it only goes in reverse. Not too useful. I took it apart and cleaned inside the housing, but still no go. My next one will NOT be a Fellows."
5,It's Great,"The balance works great. As long as you have it level, it's very accurate and easy to use. It was easy to put together and was promptly delivered. It's accurate to a quarter of a pound, and that's quite enough, I think. I recommend it."
4,scan and cartridges,"Format for scanning directly to email is not automatic. Converting to the email program that you use can be cumbersome, and may require tech support. I do not recommend using replacement cartridges from discount suppliers. They may look the same, some may work and some do not. Better stay with the Brother cartridge."
1,"If I could give it zero stars, I would.","The Brother MFC9200c is a piece of junk. Sure, the thing cleans the heads almost every time I print; everyones had that problem with the attendant time and ink wasting that involves. And, yes, the ink cartridges are a rip. However, there even more problems:I just tried connecting, via USB2, to my two-and-a-half year old laptop which uses the XP OS. First, Brother makes you do back flips to connect via USB. Second, older versions of XP don't support Brothers MFCs. Also, you can't load them directly from the bundled CD. There may be a patch somewhere, but I won't bother looking for it (besides, it's likely to make my computer crash or lock-up.)Brother is second rate, the follower in both technology and, often, price, behind HP. Basically just a, ""me, too, me, too"", company. I'll spend the $175 (about half of what I paidn for the MFC9200c) and get the HP5510."
1,Not a long-lasting printer,"I've had the same experience as several others. My printheads are all causing horizontal lines on the pages I print and the cost to fix will be over one hundred dollars (I suspect the printheads all need replacing). I've had this MFC for a little over 2 years. I don't print to it often, so it has to clean the ink cartridges every time, which takes several minutes. I also have to replace the cartridges quite often. Unfortunately, the Brother printers are the only ones I can get through my work program. Otherwise, I would definitely get something other than a Brother printer. I've used Epson and HP laser printers and love them."
4,"Fast delivery, product as advertised","This battery arrived in very quickly. It ia as advertised. Now I have two batteries, making the drill MUCH MORE useful!"
4,Best modern music album this year so far!,"I missed them two previous albums. But that was just warm up. On this album you'll here mature original sound with groundbreaking harmonies and rhytms. And even if you find some PORTISHEAD and BASEMENT JAXX quotes, you'll be happy this music. Exellent 18 songs effort! Best tracks: Pure Pleasure Seeker, Remain The Same, Time Is Now, Mother, Sing It Back. Enjoy it!"
1,Lousy product,This product left my glasses foggy and blurry. It also left streaks as it did not dry like advertised. I had to use a Goop remover to clean it off. This product is worthless
1,"Didn't work on sunglasses, followed the instructions clearly.","Didn't work on sunglasses, followed the instructions clearl. disappointed with this product and wouldn't recommend this product to others. thanks"
2,Thought I reveiwed this already?,"Used it on a pair of old glasses and it got real blurry, so I do not care for this item."
1,scary scam,"i was about to purchase this item when i was horrified to read all over the internet how the company takes forever to send you the product, randomly overcharges your credit card, and that the product itself (if you ever receive it) ends up damaging your lens. i suggest anybody thinking about buying this stuff should do their research first."
1,Glasses need CPR ??? The doctor is IN !,"WOW!!!!!! WHAT A MARVELOUS PRODUCT !!! BUY AN EXTRA AND GIVE TO A NEEDY FRIEND!!!MKAY... I'LL TURN THE CAPS LOCK OFF NOW.But seriously, make way Great Pyramid of Giza. Move over Lighthouse of Alexandria!There's a new doc on the block. This product truly IS one of the Seven Blunders of the World!So go ahead, purchase ten more As Seen on TV products. Heck, go for twenty more! You'll be so glad you did.Oh, and don't forget... never, EVER read reviews of products first. That'll only spoil your fun!Thanks for the gag gift Trude."
5,he said she said,"I am very confused by some of the reviews of this book. Especially those who state that Sha'ul's letters were written to Greeks. Really? His letters were written to Hebrew people who had left the land of Yerushalayim and journeyed far to spread Yahushua's message and/or to escape persecution. Study Jewish History. Many of the Hebrew speaking folks that journeyed to other lands, were swallowed up by the Roman Empire. Sha'ul was speaking to those Hebrew, who had entered into other lands and began to take on the ideas, doctrines and customs of the people in the lands they inhabited. He wasn't speaking to new folks in different lands, he was speaking to old folks in new lands who had forgotten the message of the Messiah. In addition, the apostles were Hebrew, as was Sha'ul. Remember, this man was a Pharisee before his conversion. He was not a Roman. Anyway, kudos to Mr. Roth for wanting to tell the truth, instead of being an ostrich with his head stuck in the sand."
4,light holiday music,"I bought this cd because my son's high school choir performed ""walking in the air"" at their Christmas program. It was the most amazing thing to hear. I wanted this to remind me of that experience. Although not quite the same sound as a large choir, it is very uplifting and I will enjoy it for years to come.The youthful voices make this a good choice for any one young or young at heart."
2,Eh,This book is really an educational book. I was looking for something more informative and interesting rather than this book trying to teach you how to achieve this level of mental power.
5,Unique and unforgettable story,"Not sure what those old reviews are doing here, but this book is not a collection of Clark Ashton Smith's stories, rather it has one story only, but one that is a masterpiece - ""City of the Singing Flame"". I think this is one of the most remarkable short stories ever written, and since its so inexpensive, its a perfect item to add if needing a little more for the shipping deal! This story deserves to be better known and appreciated by a wide audience. An outstanding introduction to the singular writer Clark Ashton Smith."
5,The Standard of Practice for Disaster Medicine,"Briggs and Brinsfield have written a comprehensive, easy to understand manual detailing the medical and public health response to disasters. Important reading for all in the disaster preparedness and response field."
2,More like a flyer,This is more like a simplified flier than a true guide for an old ER doc to brush up on Disaster Medicine. Should have picked a more comprehensive tome.
5,From Back Cover,"Caffery. The name on everybody's lips. The hero of the moment. The best goddamn hockey player who ever lived.Caffery loved it all. The game, the money, the fans, the drinking, the women. Oh how Caffery dug women!His fights were famous. Not only on the ice, but in his bedroom. He and Judy damn near killed each other half the time. But somehow Judy forgave him. He didn't know she had something going of her own.Then one day Caffery learned something about himself he didn't want to know. Something that was going to play hell with his whole life...THIN ICE - a brutally authentic tale of love, violence, and intrigue behind one of today's greatest games."
3,Needs dedicated phone line,"While it appears to do everything it promises to do, in standby mode it puts noise on the phone line that can significantly slow the data transfer rate for another modem on the line.Brother's Customer Support's answer to the problem is ""unplug the fax"" when you want to go online with your computer."
4,Very good performance at a reasonable cost,"Purchased the shredder a few months ago. Immediately put it to work shredding old bank statements, personal papers, and that endless stream of junk mail that had been piling up. It ran flawlessly for numerous hour long or more shredding sessions until I got caught up on the ""to shred"" piles. Out of habit, from my old shredder, I pulled most staples but when I missed one the PS60C-2 never fliched. I probably averaged five or six sheets at a time but if I put in eight or ten, it slowed slightly but never quit or jammed. The only down side I have noticed and most shredders probably do this is to fill up the fairly quick when doing a lot of shredding, especially under the teeth. I normally rock the shredder back and forth a time or two to settle the material and then continue. I bought my mom one for Christmas so she could shred her junk mail. I would recommend the PS60C-2 to anyone for home or light office use."
1,Returning to store,"My Walmart shredder finally died after several years of service. Since I had a gift card for Office Max I purchased the PC60C-2. After getting it situated on the basket properly, it whirred away. I put a single piece of paper in - it ran for about a third of the page. Had to turn it off and on again - about 4 times to get the single sheet of paper all the way through. Resituated the cutter on the basket and tried it again. Same thing - only works through a portion of the sheet. The shredder is now packed back in the box and is being returned to Office Max this evening. Maybe I'll go to Walmart and buy another of their cheap ones - spending $90 certainly made no difference."
5,yay for the rosebuds!,"this was my favorite cd of 2003, hands down. the rosebuds bring the rock-pop like nobody's business. you can't help dancing around and bobbing you head and singing along. these kids are awesome!"
4,Splendid,"This is some fine accordion playing. Mind you, it really isn't a simple instrument, but these fellas make it sound easy. There's also a bit of jazz violin (particularly good on ""Ain't She Sweet"") to go with the Dixieland-ish backing band. Not a lot of better ideas have been born in the world of jazz."
2,Terrible manufacture packaging,"I received this product with none of the guns secured to the packaging. The paint cups were bent to the point they could not be removed without gouging the cups. There were scratches and scrapes all over everything and looked like they were just thrown into the box. Amazon was quick to replace the guns which is why this gets two stars. However, the second set had the same problems as the first. Buyers beware..."
5,question,does anybody know if there are any extra tracks on this album that werent released in the US???
3,"Cheap and cheerful, but not for actual martial art usage","It's really just a decorative piece, or something you could swing around in the backyard. Unfortunately one needs to pay a bit more than this for an actual shinai that might be useful in practice or competition."
1,AVOID THESE VITAMINS!,"If you have ever smelled that ""vitamin"" smell, these have a really strong odor. What is worse is they taste just like they smell. Neither one of my daughters (ages 7 & 9) could taste any other flavor other than the vitamin flavor. What is worse, is that since these are gummies, the flavor sticks to your teeth and takes a while to get the rancid flavor out of your mouth."
1,DON'T BUY THIS CD,"While you won't find it mentioned anywhere on the package, or on this site, this CD is one of the first to be issued with copy protection. If you buy it, you are sending a clear message to the artist, the publisher, and the music industry in general that this is acceptable behavior.Don't buy this CD, and let the label know why you didn't buy it."
2,great CD but some issues with car cd players,"i love this CD - my dad used to be a big fan of 'gentleman jim' and it is great to hear charley singing his songs. all the songs are great but 'blue boy' and 'adios amigo' (which brought a tear to my eye) are the highlights.i had no problems with the copy protection until i went to play the CD in my new car and sure enough, it doesn't work. I would tape a copy for the car but my new car like most only has a CD player. charley seems like a pretty smart guy and i'm sure he wouldn't have done this on purpose. obviously the copy system still has a few bugs! as for now i guess i will just listen at home.without that issue, definitely a five star CD for fans of jim and charley. hopefully they will rerelease it in a better format that works with all CD players."
1,"Great CD, but dosen't work in car stereos","Excellent recording, but I CAN'T LISTEN TO IT ON MY $2500 CAR STEREO! The copy protection stops it from playing on high-end digital CD-players, because they use the same methods of data access as computer CDROMs (for skip protection and error correction), so the CD dosen't play at all. Which makes it useless to me: I'm going to return it and write an angry letter."
2,Charley Prides Tribute To Jim Reeves,"We have listen to this cd on my Sony cd player and car cd player with no problem.I think that Charley did a wonderful job,to me he even sounds like Jim Reeves,but this cd will not play on my pc at all and I can't make a backup.What if something goes wrong with this cd,I'm just out of luck with a $15.00 cd that won't work. They should have it where you can at least make one or two backups just in case."
1,Typical bad movie,"It's too obvious when they switch from pre-recorded footage from other sources to their own lame scenes. The plot completely lacks creativity (uh oh, bad guys have missiles, hero has to go stop them from launching). I don't mind action movies that use a recycled plot of they do a good job of it, but this movie has none of its own style, just a low-budget movie you would expect to be a cable network original or something like that.The only thing they added to a generic script was a brief rant by Dean Cain about how the milita nuts are afraid of the ATF (losely quoted) ""breaking into their house and taking their guns."" Newsflash Mr. Cain: that's EXACTLY what the ATF does, unless maybe they break in to take your alcohol or tobacco. If he wanted to make an anti-militia statement, doing it from the mouth of an ATF agent isn't the most convincing method."
1,Far from super,"First of all let me say that I am a huge Dean Cain fan, so I watched this movie based on the fact that he was in it. That turned out to be a mistake. The plot had holes you could drive a Mack truck through, the action sequences were a joke (I'm sure the ATF enters hostile situations single file like ducks in a row), and I don't think the writers know what the words character development mean. I was so upset I was actually yelling at the television, but at the same time I couldn't turn it off. It was like a train wreck, you have to look. If you're looking for a good action movie, run. If you're looking for a Dean Cain fix, like I was, get Best Men, Broken Hearts Club, or No Alibi; otherwise you'll lose two hours of your life you'll never get back."
3,Slightly disappointing collection,"I play keyboard in a group of amateur /semi-pro musicians who get together for jazz jam sessions every few weeks. We've heavily relied on Real Book vol 1, but we're trying to expand our repertoire and so I decided to buy vol 2. Having a large collection of fake books that I used in playing jobs in the past, I was hoping to find more keepers in Vol 2, but a lot of the tunes in there are not very familiar to me (unlike Vol 1) and many do not lend themselves to use in our jam sessions. From that point of view, I figured the price per tune that we could use was about three times as high as the price per useful tune in the first volume. The chords and alternate voicings were OK and I like the fact that you do not have turn pages to finish the tune, but in terms of the selection, I was disappointed."
4,It's just what we had in mind.,We purchased this book as a gift for a famil and fellow band member. He was ecstatic.
4,What an interesting jazz album should be,"Its early - his first real album, but in that way its good, because he's still holding onto his fresh young ideas, including the influence of serialism, as in the final last long improvisation. at first i thought this last track was a bit bits-and-pieces, but by the 22 minute mark i realised 'woa, this was actually pretty sweet and very interesting in its trajectory'.as for the rest of the album - clever jazz compositions that are structured, though with a clever 'free' sound that is not abrasive - a tight combination of structure and freer forms"
2,Dont buy this book !,"The author spends to much time telling you how he's so good he welds nuclear reactors & aircraft.But, his information on TIG welding is plain wrong.Dont buy this book, go to the Miller Welding web site to find Accurate FREE info."
2,Questionable at best,"As long as it sticks to New World vultures, this is a good reference. When it comes to Old World vultures, though, this guy simply doesn't know what he's writing about. He claims, for example, that the Bearded Vulture is incapable of carrying tortoises aloft (which it does regularly), and that the Asian Black Vulture is the largest vulture in Africa (it is the second smallest, out of nine species). I find it disturbing (if not surprising) that the Sierra Club would fund such a poorly researched and blatantly inaccurate volume. Anyone looking for an excellent reference on Old World vultures should check out The Vultures of Africa, by the South African Vulture Study Group."
5,an exellent Book of vultures and Condors,"I learned much about my favorite bird-of-prey. Giving information about Of both types of vulture (Genus Accitciprid and Cathardiae). Many people have discouraged vultures, not knowing that there smaller cousins had the same habit. Mr. Grady gives plenty of detail for these large scaengers of the air."
4,Great read....,"Well written, gives great perspective from both sides of the fence. I highly recommend reading this together and discussing each chapter."
4,Helpful in a very painful time,"It has been almost two years since I discovered my husband's betrayal. The pain is still very fresh in my mind. I wish I would have had this book when I first found out what he was doing. I have never spoken to anyone about the horrible experience except for my husband, because of this I have felt very isolated and lonely since he would rather avoid the discussion. This book allowed me to see that my feelings are ""normal"", and that the way my husband is dealing with this is also ""typical."" I have asked my husband to read parts of the book, but he will not read everything. It has given him a better understanding of what he has done to me. I skipped some of the parts that did not apply to our situation. Our marriage is getting stronger, but healing is a process that I now understand better thanks to this book."
1,"Avoid this book, Avoid this lady","If your wife is reading this book, you must divorce her immediately. It is a primer for how to collect evidence for a divorce under the guise of trying to become secure in her marriage. Janis Spring has been divorced at least once and this is her primer on screwing the guy."
1,Highly overrated - superficial,"If you're a person who had an affair and want to be coddled, read this book. If you're anyone else, don't bother. The author doesn't seem to understand the ""wrongness"" of affairs. Nor does she understand the great health risks placed on the victimized partners in this age of AIDS and other awfully stds."
1,Psychologically horrifying,"What Dr. Spring describes as ""normal"" is traumatic stress. And as a matter of hard, cold fact, a substantial proportion of victims of infidelity continue to suffer PTSD symptoms--emotional numbness, autonomic hyperarousal, nightmares and other sleep disturbances, consequent disruption of social functioning, and more -- for years. This is ""normal"" only in the sense that it is normal to suffer damage from trauma.Telling you that your post-traumatic symptoms are ""normal"" strikes me as the crassest sort of pandering."
3,Time tested advice for anyone who has been there,"I bought a used copy at the recommendation of a therapist. It is detailed and has sections for the wounded partner and the unfaithful partner. I found it useful, if a bit dated. The preface is inclusive and says that the same advice will work for same sex couples. There are exercises for each person to do to create more trust should the marriage continue. Some tough advice, but it's worth trying, even if the conclusion is to separate."
5,Dance Lover,If you're a dancer or learning about dance appreciation this is an excellent dvd!! I've coveted it myself and shown it to my modern students as well as friends who just enjoy dance. It has been loved and enjoyed by all!
2,Doesn't hold a Candle to the Original,"What a let down. I just hope the movie is not as weak as this offereing. Just never takes off. The original Broadway recording has spark and fire. This one sizzles every now and then. The vocals (with a notable exception) and the muscians are very good, but they just don't soar. It is like they are holding back. The pacing is also a little slower. The biggest distraction in this cd are the vocals of Anthony Rapp. This guy can sing, but do we really have to hear him gulp for air before every phrase? After a few listens I just couldn't stand it. Usually they will edit that out of a recording. Can't figure out why this got through or why he doesn't have better breath control by this stage of his career.Love the music, love the show, but am really dissappointed with this cd. It will be on my shelf, and the original will come off and be played when I want to listen to the music."
5,A Great Selection of Songs from the Film,"This album contains the best songs from the motion picture, from the rocking anthem ""Rent"" to the timable-flavored ""Today for You, Tomorrow for Me"" sung by Wilson Jermaine Herendia to the heart-renching ""I'll Cover You (Reprise)"" sung by Jesse L. Martin and many of the great moments in between. Members of the original Broadway cast still wring all the emotion out of every song, and the newcomers to the cast (Rosario Dawson and Tracie Thomas) are right up there with them. The songs are also presented in the order in which they appeared in the film, allowing the listener to folow the story through the songs. The last track, ""Love Heals,"" was also written by Jonathan Larson as an AIDS benefit song; the entire cast gives it a rock/gospel/r&b; flavor that results in the perfect closer for the album.Favorite songs: ""Take Me or Leave Me"" by Tracie Thomas and Idina Mendel, ""I'll Cover You (Reprise) by Jesse L. Martin, ""Rent"" by the cast."
5,Words can not discribe my love for this soundtrack!,For every movie that comes out there is a lousy soundtrack that comes to fallow. Since Rent is based on a Broadway play I was so excited to get it. I went out that day a bought it. I listened to it about six or seven times and loved every song. Each song made me think out life and how I should be living it. This soundtrack was like any other. It was extraordinary and absolutely fabulous. This soundtrack will stay in my collection for years to come and will stay in my heart for the rest of my life. Everyone who is anyone should go out and buy this soundtrack. This is no any other soundtrack to any other movie; this is a soundtrack to life. The movie Rent has showed me that I must live everyday like it is my last. Please go out and buy the soundtrack Rent and fall in love with New York all over again.
1,Worst album of the year,This must surely be the worst album of the year. The singing is just so bad! There is also a total absence of interpretation. Terrible recording.
1,Stunningly bad,"To be honest, I was stunned by this album. The singing is just unspeakably bad! Had I known beforehand that the performance on this album is so poor, I wouldn't have bought this album even if it had cost a quarter of its price.It's indecent for any artist or recording company to sell an album at full price when the quality of it is so low."
1,An unworthy reprise,"Having given us 2 very badly sung album, Russell Watson now makes an unworthy repirse with this new recording. The singing here is, unfortunately, even worse than before. It seems that Watson's vocalism has actually declined over the past 2 years instead of improving.A forgettable album by an untalented singer."
5,Words fail to describe,"I am just blown away by that voice of Russell's. The way he sings...there is so much passion in it. I am no fan of opera, but after listening to Russell, my perspective have totally changed. This is one album to get. Trust me, you won't regret it."
1,Ugly Singing,"I hate the singing on this album. It's just so ugly! The performances are unmusical. In fact, almost anti-musical as the singer merely belts out everything at high volume without any sense of phrasing and style.Very crude performances. Unworthy to be released."
1,Acutely disappointed by this cd,"I'm very disappointed by what I heard on this cd. After read all those positive commentaries here, I expected that Russell Watson must be a fabulous singer. The truth is that his singing is much worse than the crooning of most people at the karaoke!Indeed, Watson's fails both as regards technical matters and interpretation. His singing is rough and inaccurate and the performances are charmless and stolid.Can't imagine a bigger disappointment from a vocal recording."
1,Poor singing,"There's no doubt that the singer on this album is poor. Russell Watson fails to do justice to the music. In some cases, he can't even sing the notes properly.This is an album of little artistic value."
1,Ugly singing,I'm disappointed by this cd. The singing here is simply ugly. There's no sense of style and no trace of a musical mind in operation. Everywhere is just plain loud and unsubtle singing. No shouting.It's depressing to hear good music being trashed like that.
1,Unrepresentative of classical singing,"It is laughable that people can consider Russell Watson to have been singing opera when he hasn't even performed an opera on the stage. In fact, he isn't able to perform classical vocal music without amplification, which immediately exposes the fact that Mr Watson isn't neither a tenor nor a competent classical singer.The only thing that he is doing here is to trace the ""tunes"" of some classical songs. Unfortunately, he can't even do this well - his singing is hoarse and coarse and there's little by way of interpretation. Even if we disregard all the markings in the original score (which Watson is, of course, incapable of realising with his severely limited vocal means), his singing is still extremely unsubtle.In all, a low point in the history of vocal recordings. An album to forget."
1,"Can't be compared to Bocelli, Safina, Groban and Frangoulis","I think Russell Watson's performances cannot be compared to those by Bocelli, Safina, Groban and Frangoulis.The reason? The above 4 singers all have a more beautiful voice, a stronger technique, more communicative power and interpretative flair. By contrast, Watson's singing is like the coarse sounds emitted by a robot. No feeling at all! And he committed countless vocal blunders along the way.Not an enjoyable recording at all."
2,"Looks great, but howls like a banshee","Very attractive unit, but the high speed fan setting (which provides good stove top venting) is not useable do to the extreme noise level. However, the lights are nice."
3,Is it shipped new??,"I would have given this product 4 or 5 stars, except I'm skeptical about whether I received a new or ""new but returned"" product. I've purchased stainless steel products in the past; and new products - in my experience - always come with a blue transparent protector layer on it. This product did not. This product also did not include any screws or anything extra parts. When I opened the box, it was literally the range hood, and the filter. (I think we had to pay extra for the filter, but cannot be positive about it, since it was a while back). Luckily our original range hood was also a Broan product in the same line, so we were able to reuse the screws and the bulbs."
4,"Pretty good, could be quieter on high setting","Construction is a bit flimsy, especially in comparison to the 16 year old vent I replaced it with. But once its in place, I guess that doesn't matter a whole lot. Hopefully the switches and motor will stand up well with use. The fan on high setting is quite loud. Also the need for halogen lamps of a specific size seems a bit bogus. They could have easily put in a standard lamp holder IMHO."
1,Poorly constructed,"This hood looks good, but the quality control is lacking. It arrived without the parts bag which entailed a trip to Home Depot for extra parts for installation. The fan also makes a ting, ting, ting sound on low and a TING, TING, TING sound on high. The motor is very quiet but who cares now. I will try to find where the blade is hitting, but I should not have to do that."
5,"Quiet motor, bright lights","I absolutely love this vent hood! It was easy to install, I did it by myself up to the end when I needed someone to hold it up to screw in and I have never installed anything like this...just followed the instructions. It has two huge filters (dishwasher safe!) that take up the whole back part of the vent hood. In the front, I installed two halogen lights (not included) and they light up the whole stove area. The lights on low are twice as bright as my old vent hood on high. The motor is super quiet on low, if it wasn't for the light, I probably wouldn't know it was running. On high you can hear it, but still carry on a conversation. This hood was all that I could hope for and the price with Amazon was unbeatable. Home Depot was over $80 more for the same thing, crazy! Highly recommend this product and Amazon!"
4,works but noisy,"Good, nice looking hood but it is very noisy on high speed. Also don't forget to buy filters if you don't connect it to ducting."
2,Difficult to follow,"I had to order this book for my college philosophy course and I must say, out of the 3 years i've been in college, this has been my least favorite book. It is extremely hard to understand and follow. However, if you're looking for ways to fall asleep at night, then I definitely recomind this!"
2,Not needed.,"I ordered this bracket using the ""Frequently Bought Together"" option that Amazon paired with the ""Nvidia Geforce 6200, Low Profile Support / 256MB Ddr / Agp 8X /support Dvi, Tv"" video card. I did not need this low profile bracket kit. The video card provided the low profile brackets, VGA cable/connector, and also a DVI to VGA adapter."
3,Does not fit the Nvidia Geforce 6200 card,No matter what Amazon says this kit DOES NOT fit the Nvidia Geforce 6200 card. Fortunately a low profile kit is already included in the Nvidia Geforce 6200 package.
4,It does what it suppose to do!,"I have purchased this bracket for my DELL C521(small form factor system) for my customer's project! This was the part of multi-monitor solution.It is nicely packed and provides varieties of configuration possible.Wish it is little bit cheaper. Except the price, the product itself is great solution for low-profile base graphic card."
4,Awsome for what it does!!!,"I purchased this because my son realized that we needed a low profile bracket to put the XFX video card into our new computer. Went online and easily found this product. It was inexpensive and came with anything you would need to put a new bracket onto the card. Easy to follow directions. Any level of user could switch the brackets. The beauty is you get several different brackets to fit any configuration on the XFX card. The only problem came when there was no HDMI port bracket that didn't leave an open hole for an S-Video connection (There is no S-video connection on my card). This problem was quickly solved with the world's most universal repair agent....Duct Tape!!!! A little piece to cover the 2cm hole and Viola...problem was solved.If looking for a low-profile conversion bracket kit, this one gets my Gold Star recommendation. You won't be disappointed.And thanks to all of the Amazon folks who helped me along the way, you all did awsome!!!!!"
4,It's a thinking person's movie,"I like this film ever since i first saw it six, seven years ago. Each time I see it I learn something new. It's just so full of information. It's definitely a movie to feed a hungry person's mind."
5,A mind gripping dialogue that opens minds...,"Mind Walk is an expansive work that grows with each viewing. Line by line, scene by scene Capra successfully opens ones eyes to a systems thinking approach of looking at anything and gaining new insight. The beauty lies within the casting of three major and unlikely characters. A poet that has exited the materialistic and self centered ""I"" world of the United States, an unsuccessful presidential candidate who is licking his wounds, and a brilliant scientist that has been disheartened by the reality that her R&D efforts have been applied to military applications. The film is in essence a serendipitous dialogue between the three that challenges the division of the mechanistic / reductionist and opens the door to the realm of an interconnected and linked reality. This film is not for the weary, but aleart and listen closely. For if you do, you will return to again and again to continue the openning of your own eyes."
4,"Modern, Quirky, new-wave influenced rock","A modern mix of new-wave, punk, and ska, and early No Doubt, but updated and much cooler. There's only 1 track I don't particularly like (Too Little Too Late), but the rest are good, and the best 2 or 3 are brilliant. Stand-out tracks: Glass Ceiling (my favorite), Poster of a Girl, Monster Hospital, Live it Out."
1,Disappointed with the Sonic Boom Alarm Clock,"I returned this item. It is not a loud alarm, certainly not sonic boom loud and I have perfect hearing. It felt very cheaply made/constructed. It was not at all what I expected. The display was nice, however. I was very disappointed, because I had read about this clock on the website and it seemed like the perfect clock for me."
3,Can't Stand the Sound,"This clock is priced nicely and has good features, particularly the large number display. However, no matter how it is set, the alarm sounds like a child learning clarinet: it is an awful way to wake up. It also sends my cats running. If you need an adrenaline rush or this is the only kind of sound you can hear, it might work for you. It makes my teeth hurt!"
3,Meets Requirements,"The clock I got meets the requirements I have, but it is not as good as touted.Problems: The silent alarm only works on the highest setting, ""Vibe and buzz."" If set to vibe or buzz alone, it does nothing. The base is very shallow, while the clock is fairly tall, so if you aren't instantly wide awake, you're more likely to knock the clock over than to turn the alarm off.Bonuses: The display has very large numbers, making it easy to read. It also has 3 brightness settings, which range from so dim it hardly throws any light to bright, which could substitute for the bat-signal.Overall: I got enough functionality from this clock that I did not return it, but I did not get what I paid for. This seems to be the prevailing opinion with ""silent alarm"" clocks no matter the manufacturer, so I count myself as satisfied enough to not complain unless asked about it."
1,Not loud enough,I purchased this clock for my daughter and it is not loud enough. We were able to use the vibrating part on her old Sonic clock and that is great. It also gets hot.
5,Loud and big screen,This is perfect gift for occasional early risers who do not normally need to get up early in the morning (like 4-5 am.). Big screen is also the plus.
3,Still shaking,"This alarm clock will defiantly wake the hardest sleeper on the planet. I purchased this for my husband mostly because I thought the vibrater would be a better alternative to the annoying ""beep, beep"". The vibrater is powerful to the point of extreme. We never tried it, but I think you would probably pee your pants and jump out of bed every morning! The main reason we sent it back was because of the large digital display. My hubby is blind as a bat and he could read the digital display, but we could also read the newspaper from the glow. If you are a hard sleeper and a night light doesn't bother you, then this is a great purchase. If not, keep on searching!"
2,buyer beware,"I purchaced this clock in October 08 and it is already broken. The power cord has some sort of short in it and I have yet to find a place to purchace another one, although I found simular ones (wrong amps) at Radio Shack, and they cost more than this clock.The alarm itself is a most irritating screech (Think fingernails accross a blackboard magnified by 100)!It will wake you up, but it is a very unpleasant awakening! I got to where I turned the sound down and just let the vibrating disc jump around in a stainless steel bowl. In fact, the reason I give it 2 stars instead of one is that you can adjust the volume.This product is a good idea on paper but too bad they used the cheapest possible materials."
4,Alarm Clock,bought it for my mother who is hard of hearing. This works very well and my mother loves it. She wakes up just fine now.
3,Alarm clock,"This clock is a replacement for an earlier sonic boom clock whose vibrator stopped working. It is a different model, purchased because of the price. A review I read when I ordered this one said that it toppled over easily, but thought we'd give it a try. Out of the box, yep, stand it up and try to touch the alarm stop button, and there it goes. It falls over. But, I'm not one much for returning things, so we'll keep this for now. Now that we know it falls over, we'll be prepared when we turn off the alarm. The time display is very large, which is nice, but the housing is very thin, thus the reason it's not very stable."
4,Perfect,I don't even use the alarm. The bed shaker wakes me up with no problem - and doesn't piss off my house mates!
4,works great,"Purchased because my husband was tired of the constant beeping of old digital alarm clock that I counstantly hit the snooze button on ""it keeps me awake & I can't get back to sleep"". So I searched & found the Sonic Booom SB300. First week he Loved it! Second week I didn't have it on vibrate (which will wake the dead!!!)had it on buzz WELL WE BOTH SAT STRAIGHT UP...WOW they says it's loud & it is, scared the crap outta us. Third week, He still can't get back to sleep, now he feels the vibe but it's under my pillow,,,I LOVE IT, forget what you read about him, it's always him....LOLSO all in all it will wake the dead. COMplaints are that the slide switch for buzz or vib or buzz/vib easy to push to one you don't want to hear, I have learned to count the notches. Setting the clock and alarm you get used to it, buttons are easy, seeing the words to let you know which button is which, I had to use my glasses and magnifying glass."
1,Croaker,"If you look in the dictionary under the word, ""junk"" you will see a picture of this clock! It worked when I first purchased it but it wasn't long before it began to work when it felt like it. If you buy this clock be prepared to buy another to wake you up so you can watch this one do nothing at the time you intended it to wake you."
2,not as good as the sonic boom 500,"I had a sonic boom 500ss which worked the best of any alarm clock I ever had. It got fried in a lightning storm, and I bought this model to replace it. I liked the appearance of this model better. While this alarm clock is louder than most, it is not as loud as the 500ss. The vibration doesn't seem to be as strong either. On the 500ss, it alternated noise/vibration/noise/vibration which also helped me to wake up. This model doesn't alternate, you get both at the same time. Since I have an extremely difficult time getting up in the mornings, I am returning this model and will order the 500ss again.I gave this 2 stars because it is louder than most other alarm clocks. However, it you're going to buy a $30 alarm clock - get the 500ss."
4,Effective but unstable,"This alarm clock pretty much does the trick. I don't have to worry about sleeping through it anymore. I'm a REALLY deep sleeper, but the vibrating extension really gets me up. The only problem I have is that it tips over easily. The base of the alarm clock isn't big enough for it, so it constantly gets tipped over. Other than that, it works great."
2,false advertising,"I ordered this for a birthday gift. My husband wanted both a hard and sort carrying case. Barska advertises this item as coming with A tripod, soft case ,premium hard case and the scope for a certain amount of money but when it arrived alas no soft case . when I contacted barska directly they informed me that they make generic descriptions !!!!even though I paid for all 4 items they say they dont even make a soft case to fit this size scope!! how nice for them to make generic descriptions maby my money could be generic, perhaps they will accept monoply money next time!! Amazon did credit me 15.00 for my trouble but the supervisor from barska has never contacted me as they promised.Be ware of barska products they lie"
1,Plotless,"This is the worst short story anthology I've ever read. Many of the stories are plotless rambles. Many are incoherent. Maybe they're edgy, but so what if they aren't about anything and you can't understand them?"
3,Okay product,"The umbrella part was great. Unfortunately, the piece used to ""drill"" it into the sand did not sustain very much of a breeze at all. We never used the umbrella at the beach because it would not stay up."
5,"Nice setup, solidly built","My last pole system was bent in half (maybe by a bear?) and became useless. Bought this one because the poles are wider in diameter compared to what I had, which makes it much more durable than other models. It went into the ground well over a foot rather easily, and feels nice and secure. There are a ton of hooks (8 to be exact) to accommodate the many feeders I use. Very happy with it."
2,BEYOND EXPIRED!,great book if you still own an Atari or Commodore. nothing in the book applies to modern computers of 2004
4,Mix your own version man.,"This CD, which is balls to the wall, has Umixit which lets you add pre-loaded effects and loops & lets you record your own version right on your computer. Love it."
2,Give Me A Plane and a Song,"This is a very early serial that people still tend to talk about a lot. In my view it's famous mainly because the hero breaks out into a really dumb little song in the middle of an airplane in Chapter One, and again a couple of times later in the picture. ""Ace Drummond"" was a comic strip created by World War One flying ace Captain Eddie Rickenbacker.John King was better known for Westerns--he should have stuck to them. Jean Rogers, of course, was Dale Arden in the first two Flash Gordon serials, and also appeared in ""Secret Agent X-9"" (1937). Guy Bates Post, a great old character actor, is great as the Grand Lama. Lon Chaney, Jr. plays a small part as a henchman, which he often did in serials."
3,it motivates you to do something about your cholesterol.,"I found the VHS video at the library, its ISBN # is 1-56832-276-3 Library index: AVHS 613.28 Dr. It comes with an ""Information booklet"" which was missing. If you know where I can buy it let me know. I would like to donate it to the library."
3,Fun interpretation of the real thing...,"I am a huge Counting Crows fan and got this for Christmas. It is really just a good, fun listen. Each song captures the essence of the original and is decent bluegrass on its own.Don't buy this looking for great bluegrass or completely fresh interpretations. These songs sound like bluegrass versions of the originals, nothing too inspired. But, a good listen nonetheless."
4,Cam comes to the rescue!,"The 2176 series comes to an exciting close with a story both complex and emotionally satisfying. Cam 'Scarlet' Tucker has been found and removed from her cryogenic container. But the efforts to keep her hidden from those that want her for political reasons fail. Cam is captured by a disguised Prince Kyber, who is still hurting from Banzai Maguire's escape and subsequent capture by the UCE. As Kyber and Cam form an emotional bond Banzai attempts to survive the brutal tortures of the UCE regime. The revolution begins, the Voice of Freedom is revealed, and Cam comes to the patriotic rescue. Recommended."
4,Great movie!,"I think this is one of the funniest and best things Neil Simon ever wrote. It's a riot!For some reason, people seem to forget about this movie. I have no idea why. Chevy Chase and Goldie Hawn are great in this! So is Charles Grodin. Actually, there's not a bad thing I can say about this movie. It's got a great story, very likeable characters, and it's a lot of fun.If you've never seen it, you should see it. If you've already seen it, you should see it again."
1,HUH ?,I never ordered this item nor did I recieve it so to rate an item I never purchased or recieved is kind of foolish dont you think ?
4,Goldie and Chevy Together Again (with Dogs),"Not as good as their initial effort (Foul Play), Seems Like Old Times still has its moments. Goldie is an attorney who defends hard-luck cases, married to Charles Grodin. Then the ultimate hard-luck case comes back into her life, her ex-husband (Chase) who was forced into helping with a bank robbery. Watch for the family housekeeper, who has an attitude (but how could you help it with this family?) and Goldie's collection of dogs."
5,Fail-Safe,"Classic cold war thriller. Fairly reasonable plot, well acted, attention-holding. You should see this to get a flavor of the 1950' and 60's, when a commie was behind every door."
2,Interesting... Just it enough,"I was required to watch the movie... It was interesting at first, but not interesting enough to keep me awake during the second half."
2,Failed!,"This has a rep as a Cold War classic and I've heard a couple of film-nerks compare it to ""Strangelove"" but believe me, it doesn't even come close. Clunky, hack-handed direction turns the excellent cast into a parade of talking heads. Sidney Lumet was one of those ""serious"" old Hollywood directors who took on ""important"" themes and is revered for it now - but to me his work often comes off as quite wooden and by-the-book. If you gotta have your doomsday drama without Kubrickian humor then maybe try ""On the Beach"" or something... but skip this solemn turkey!"
3,well written anti-heroic tragedy,"A well written book. The author does a very good job of relating the turmoil and confusion most of us face in our lives every day. The only thing that detracted from the book for me was the focus. With the wife of the smuggler as the protagonist, you end up seeing the seeing the smuggler as a victim. The view that an otherwise law abiding person whose only fault is that he smuggles relatively benign illicit substances by the TON, is still a good person flabbergasts me. Yet every day I meet people who would be completely won over by this argument. I understand real life is not black and white, but I seldom read for a representation of real life ;)"
3,Sterling Silver it is not!,"I was very excited when I got this ring in the mail. I put it on, and wore it about 3-4 hours. Taking it off that night, I was sad to see a green ring around my finger had already appeared underneath the ring. I went out and bought clear nail polish and painted the inside of the ring with it, and I am happy to say no more green has appeared on my finger when I wear the ring.I am very dissapointed in the fact that my finger was turned green right away. Sterling Silver has never done this to me before, so I have doubts that these rings are actually made or even coated in sterling silver.So be warned: If you buy a cheap ring, you're going to get a cheap ring. Be wise and order accordingly."
3,Good,"variety of items, quality standard and quite functional at the time of exercising the body. But quite versatile in bringing the different parts of the body."
4,Worth reading!,"I read Susan Wright's story in two days. I couldn't put it down. It could have been longer and it would have been nice to get more detail with regard to the relationship she had with her husband; that part was a little too short and not enough particulars. It was still enjoyable and mesmerizing. I found the prosecuting attorney's part also very interesting. She was relentless in her pursuit to find justice. Bringing the bed into court and re-enacting the murder was unbelievable. I love non-fiction, especially true crime, so this was right up my alley. Check it out; you won't be disappointed."
2,Not appropriate for loose curls or wavy hair; smells like eggs,"I have very wavy hair/loose spiral curls in my hair and I am always on the lookout for products that don't weigh down my hair but at the same time define the curls a bit better. Therefore I had high hopes for this curl activator spray.I was to be disappointed, however. I found that it just sat on top of the hair and left it far too greasy. I also detested the smell - to me it smelled like rotten eggs. Not surprising, given that one of the ingredients happens to be Egg Protein Oil.Perhaps the product would be better suited to more coarse and dry hair types (or hair that is protein-starved), but I do not recommend this product for persons of my hair type - very wavy to loose curls with hair that is medium in thickness, and not really too dry.What bothered me more than the oiliness of the product - I could have just used less - was the smell which kept me even from reusing the bottle."
1,This product sucks!,"My daughter needs a curl activator with minimal smell. We bought this according to some other reviews stating that the strong smell fades quickly when it dries. It did not. And we can't return it because she waited a little too long to try it, so we're stuck with this stinky stuff! I'm terribly disappointed with this product and the seller's return policy."
3,You Might feel Tormented while watching this,"Tormented had promise starting with some good actors like Alex Pettyfer of 'Beastly' and 'I am number Four' fame.The story was about kids that bullied an unattractive student they called Shrek.Well,Shrek who's name in the film is Darren Mullet comes back as a pseudo zombie and takes revenge on those who were mean to him and the list of bullies is extensive.The storyline had promise but fizzled in the middle.The deaths were unoriginal and boring as was most of this 'slasher movie'.I say skip it and see something else Like Rabies or Rovdyr.Both are Indie slashers one from Israel and the other from Sweden..and both are excellent."
1,Run of the Mill Religious ( ),"Even by the low standards of anti-Mormon literature, this is a pretty pedestrian book. It makes no real effort to understand its subject, always seeking instead merely to score a point. It isn't original, and it doesn't deal with serious Mormon arguments. (And there ARE some, despite what certain smug anti-Mormons say.) Rather, it refutes straw men.You'll only read relatively few books during your lifetime. There are thousands more worthwhile than this piece of dreary ( )."
1,Ridiculous diet!,"As a certified Pilates instructor, I was very interested in & excited about this book, until I read it. It is crazy to think that it is healthy to count your bites at every meal. I have tried almost every diet in the world and this one, I would not even consider. Since a number of the people who read diet books have eating disorders, I think that this book will only make their obsession with food worse. I am no psychologist, but I know that this could not be healthy for your mind."
3,Are these reviews for real?,"Hey, does it seem suspicious that the two people who reviewed this book are BOTH from the same town (Sante Fe) as the authors? This makes me wonder about the credibility of the reviews. Are they friends, coworkers, students? What's the story?I am actually interested in buying the book, but the rave reviews from suspect reviewers are making me think twice."
1,Disappointed,Bought this book after returning from NY & having had the cupcakes and the Chocolate cake.I followed the recipe letter for letter and the chocolate cupcakes and the vanilla buttercream icingwould have been better from a Duncan Hines box. Very DISAPPOINTED!!
4,review,"Good condition for the book. I wished the book had more pictures and were colored. I also wished the pages were the heavy paper. The service was great, very fast but am disappointed in the book."
1,Not very good !!!!!,"I have been a professional cook now for about 8 years and I am maybe not the best baker in the world, but I do pretty good. After reading the reviews I decided to try this book for myself, I was looking for the Best Cupcake Recipe. Well I certainly DID NOT find it here (even though the front cover is cupcakes). The cupcakes were hard to swallow they were so heavy and oily and the icing almost made my teeth fall out. NO ONE liked them. I did find the best recipe (not from the book), but it took me 4 days and lots of trys, but I now have my own. I agree completely with the other negative reviews at least for the recipes that I tried."
4,amazing!!,"after visiting the magnolia bakery i wanted to recreate that same homemade goodness. i was pleased to find that there were many recipes listed. i made the red velvet cupcake and they were amazing. also, i was happy to discover that there is another option for frosting other than cream cheese or regular vanilla buttercream. the creamy vanilla frosting is out of this world. i followed the steps very carefully and was NOT disappointed. am looking fwd to trying other recipes!"
3,Not as good as Ubelaker's other books,"I agree that the coverage of Active Server Pages technology is extremely weak, as the author focusses his discussion mainly on Noth African snake mites and the various controversies surrounding Stedman's naming conventions for them. The O'Reilly ""ASP In A Nutshell"" by A. Keyton Weissinger would be my recommendation."
2,Disappointed,"I've been looking forward to Ewoks the Animation to come to dvd just as long as I've waited for She-Ra, He-Man, etc. But it's not a box set, or Volume series. It's just a few episodes, enough to tease, then disapoint you. so if you think you'll be content with a few episodes go ahead. But if you're still waiting for the COMPLETE SERIES like me, keep holding on."
1,Difficult and Confusing Text,"I am using this book in a senior-level research methods course and my classmates and I are all very frustrated with it. It assumes you already know all of the methods, and even though I have a good statistics background, I am having difficulties. It is extremely time-consuming to work through, so expect to spend a very significant amount of time on each chapter. I do not recommend this book for any individual with little or no statistics knowledge, and I caution those who do know statistics."
5,Todd rocks (pun intended).,"I discovered this gem of a series by accident, then I ""accidentally"" watched the rest of the first season. When it's not indulging in B movie campiness, the dialogue is rift with humor and lends itself to quotable so very easily. While the story is a bit monster of the week, there's no doubt that by the end, you'll be thoroughly invested in the characters. The standout character (for me) is definitely Atticus Murphy Jr., his story arc continues to be entertaining. I look forward to watching the second season, and encourage anyone who likes horror and/or metal to give this series a try."
1,A Holy Book turned into a joke,"The point most people tend to miss is that any book that says it is from God needs to be treated very seriously. Only the sincere can grasp the books and understand the underlying purpose which is God's Absolute Authority. Once that is understood, then things like the messengers, prophets, signs, proofs etc all have to be accepted. No matter who or how the books are translated, without guidance from someone authorized by God, there is no meaning and only misguidance. How unfortunate the state of things are today."
4,Received Promptly,"The hitch was received promptly and exactly as advertised. Unfortunately for me, I hadn't measured carefully enough and my receiver was just about 1/4"" too long and I couldn't fit both pins in. I was more concerned about the length of the bike rack tongue than the 2"" receiver I was fitting it into.Oh well, not the fault of the seller, though. The dimensions were clearly spelled out on the product page, SO PAY ATTENTION AND MEASURE WELL!Product itself is solid and well made."
3,"Excellent book, but not for exam","This is one of the best books on systems and database design I have ever read. However, it will not prepare you for the exam. The exam is a series of case studies and this book does not offer any practice at doing this. I was able to pass it on the first try, but only with the Transcender which mirrored the exam. My advice is to get the Transcender and read this book. It is an excellent book, but should not be your main study guide for this extremely challenging exam."
4,Not as big a help as I had hoped,"If you are going to take the test, skim through this book and then download the sample Transcender test. If I had used *only* this book, I probably would have failed or passed by a slim margin. The information in the book is good, but it is hard for any book to provide a simulation of the new testing questions."
3,Good Book but not for exam...,"This book won't really help you to pass the exam. (It may only help you for couple multiple choices during the exam). If you want to pass this tough exam, I strongly recommend you to get Transcender. Actually, I would like to say ""you must get it"""
1,"Complete Waste of Time, Money and Effort","If you have never analyzed requirements or defined solution architectures in an organizational setting, this is a good starting point. However, if you have a beginning knowledge, and believe you are ready to prepare for the 70-100...this book will not help you at all!The questions in this book are nothing like the actual exam questions! If you are looking for a text that will be helpful, try the New Riders. The format of the questions on the CD in the New Riders book is very similar to some of the questions on the actual exam. Plus, the New Riders does a better job of getting you prepared for the format of the exam.Best Resource for exam preparation: Transcender...BAR NONE!"
1,Worthless for test preparation,"I'm sorry, but I disagree with the other reviewers. While this is generally a good book to read, it does absolutely NOTHING to prepare you for exam 70-100. NONE of the questions on the test (at least the one I took) can be answered by studying (or even MEMORIZING) this book. I'm not sure what will adequately prepare you for this exam, but this textbook definitely will NOT. The exam is comprised almost entirely of case studies which is very difficult to teach in a book."
4,Don't waste your time on thick books,"I am writing this review just after I passed the test. Many subjects on the test elapse those on the cores and the database elective (I took SQL Server). 80% of the test is about business analysis and tables design while the other 20% covers COM, classes, interface design, etc. No one book except the Transcender Exam will prepare you for the test. But if you feel obligated to read something, this is the book to read. The test asked nothing about MSF, so don't waste your money and time reading thick tomes. This book is succinct and very well written and the sections on COM and user-interfaces were pertinent to the test. I rated it 4 stars because it lacks simulated scenarios like those of the real test. Last point, Transcender is a must, I felt that Transcender CD better prep me for the test than any other reading materials."
3,I AM,"The cinematography was good....the story line was quirky, going from the seriousness of the illness to folks never having heard of Ace Ventura...I would have skipped that, because it showed that the people who you respected didn't even know much about your work. I was surprised you were able to get interviews with them. I enjoyed Desmond Tutu's remarks. I liked most that the interviews which helped understand how our thinking of materialistic things leads to happiness....which of course is a myth. I liked the ending... I had a very hard time watching this movie technically which Amazon actually refunded because the screen kept indicating that the pop up blocker was on/screen saver but it was disengaged. The film kept stopping which was frustrating. I might consider purchasing it for my own viewing at home."
3,I am is ok,"Although the main message of the movie is applaudable, the director could have included more depth and substance throughout the movie."
5,"inspiring, uplifting, beautiful movie",This movie will lift your spirit. If you wonder about mankind and the universe and where we are headed.... I watch this movie whenever I need a pick-me-up and I have shown it to middle-school and high-school students when we discuss having a life of purpose. The religion teacher also showed it. Great movie for ages 12- 120 :)
4,Thought provoking,"After watching Oprah's interview with Tom Shadyac in 2011 I was intrigued by Tom's story of ""having it all"" and then discovering one day just how little it ""all"" meant to him. I related to many of his thoughts and appreciated his interviews with some of today's most brilliant minds.Only negative feedback: the production quality is poor, very grainy. Don't expect big budget quality."
5,A fresh breath of optimism for a weary world,"This is a good perspective video for those of us who may lament the current mess we're in as a species. It provides some fresh looks at a few things and stimulates thinking and even optimism about how it all may end up. Highly recommended for its inspirational tone, but short on ""what do I do on Monday?"" details."
3,I AM - Not what I expected,After seeing the info on Opraha I was expecting something different. I enjoyed it and it did bring some good considerations for us to look at in life.
2,"Watch ""the Secret"" instead.","I love these ""what is the meaning of life?"" documentaries. But this one seemed pretty self-serving. I much preferred ""the Secret"" which really does offer some answers, and a path."
5,Excellent!,"I wish that everyone would watch this documentary! It presents astounding, life changing evidence of the connection that exitsts between all beings."
1,"Another CHEAP ""PHILOSOPHY"" made into a movie!","THE MESSAGE OF THE MOVIE IN SHORT:MAN TENDS TO ALWAYS CHOOSE EVIL: INVADING POOR DEFENSELESS COUNTRIES, INVENTING AN INFECTIOUS DISEASE (AND PROFITING FROM IT) AND CREATING LAWS TO LEGALIZE MURDER (ABORTION, WAR AND LETHAL INJECTION) HOWEVER,THE CREATOR OF THE MOVIE STATES THAT: AS LONG AS MAN IS ""INHERENTLY GOOD,"" MAN CAN AND DOES CONTINUE TO CHOOSE EVIL OVER GOOD!..IF THIS ISN'T SELLING A ""CHEAP PHILOSOPHY,"" I DON'T KNOW WHAT IS?"
4,Was Enlightening,Worth watching and has many thought provoking ideas to share. I will watch it a couple more times and give it to my friends.
5,Outstanding!!!!,I recently viewed 'I Am' on Oprah's OWN Network. I have felt this way for some time now about the world around me and how we (and really all things)interrelate with each other. It reaffirmed my life's journey. There is absolutely no reason to think that God/Spirituality & the physical world are separate entities. We should embrace both and be excited!!
2,What's the rave on this?,"Mediocre to boring -- Held a few interesting facts, but all in all...one great big yawn! Do not recommend for any reason!"
5,Well worth the time watching. Much to think about.,"WOW. What a production. This world of materialism, greed, and self-centeredness is certainly questioned. Filmed & produced by someone who has been there, film producer of some big comedy hits, his own health issues & possible death gave him some serious self-examination. It changed his life & his values."
1,I was deeply disturbed.,"In the beginning i thought it was an excellent and interesting concept. The hero is a hangman...COOL!! And then i began to notice alot of similarities between the hero and Jamie Fraser from Outlander, from their red hair, to their very similar choice of language and dialect. Too similarities. I found myself throwing this book out and i have a deep opposition to throwing books out."
4,A challenge to find your Glory,This is an excellent book that implores today's chistian's to discover and manifest the glory that God has placed in all of us. Very motivating.
1,WANNA BE RAPPER,STOP COPYING OFFA JAYZ I THOUGHT IT WAS JAY Z CLONE THE THEORY OF LIFE OR THE THEORY YOU SHOULD RETIRED IN THE G ////COMMON GOT HIS OWN STYLE AND I GUESS CAP ONE GOT HIS(JAY Z)STYLE LATA I'M GLAD I BOUGHT THIS ON BOOTLEGGED 3 BUCKS AND MAKING MONEY OFF THIS WEAK ONE HOW THE HECK DID HE DO IT????MAKE A CD'S THAT WHAT
4,A Woman's Search,"Thirty-four year old Ella Price is a wife, mother, and college student. Ella returns to college in search of herself or something that will give meaning to her life. She takes an English class from Dan Harkan, a professor who requires his students to keep a journal. The reader learns about Ella, her hopes, dreams, frustrations, and disappointments by reading her journal, a series of writings that is both humorous and revealing. Near the end of the semester, Ella writes in her journal, ""I'm still the same neuroitc I always was. And my life is still a bad soap opera.""First published in 1972, Ella Price's Journal touches on some timeless subjects including marriage, divorce, parenting, and religion. Ella Price's Journal is a quick, enjoyable read."
3,"Yoga for the Three Stages of Life: Developoing Your Practice As anArt Form, a Physical Therapy, and a Guiding Philosophy",Not as user friendly as I had hoped for. The title was one of the best aspects of the book.
5,"Discussions of yoga techniques geared to age, sex & ability","Individuals ready to devote their lives to the field of yoga will find Yoga For The Three Stages Of Life an excellent introduction which blends the usual guide to postures and meditation practices with insights on adapting yoga to individual needs and different stages of life. Young and old receive appropriate discussions of yoga techniques geared to age, sex and ability."
4,"Nice weight, nice color, shrinks","I bought this drop cloth to use as a throw cover on a sofa where dogs like to sleep. Right out of the box and out of the bag it had no odor at all. It is a nice weight and a lovely oatmeal color. I machine washed and dried it which changed the texture. It's much softer and wrinkled, but an attractive wrinkling like washed linen. There is a seam down the middle that is blue jean stitched, so it's not going to fall apart or fray.The 12 foot (144 inch) length was actually 11 feet 10 inches (142 inches), and it shrank to 11 feet 2 inches (134 inches).It shrank more in width. The 9 foot (108 inch) width was actually 8 feet 10 inches (106 inches) and it shrank to 7 feet 5 inches (89 inches)."
3,Product shrinks significantly,"The product arrived promptly and is of good, heavy weight. It is washable; however, after the first wash (cool water, extra low heat) is shrank to less than 7x9' - quite significant. Though I'm sure I'll find uses for this cloth overtime, it no longer works for my intended means."
1,Are we still true?,"Be true to your school is an account of the events of one boy's life in 1964. Many people don't think that there are many similarities of 1964 and 2001, but after reading this, I do. Alcohol was a problem then and has developed, I feel, into even more of a problem. Relationships, school, friends, family and even athletics all have strong similarities. This book was interesting to read mainly because it was from a guy's perspective. However, at the end you are left hanging. You don't know what happens in future. If Bob Greene wanted to improve this book he should include some kind of wrap-up to that part of his life."
2,Over blown characters,CHERRY starring Kyle Gallner & Brittany Robertson.Supposedly a funny coming of age movie in which a virginal college freshman falls in love with a 31 yr. old freshman that has a 14 yr. old daughter who falls in love with him. I thought this could be really funny & touching at the same time but the characters are just toons. I never felt that this was happening to people & therefore could of cared less about what happened to them. A 40 yr. Old Virgin remake or more like a scaled down American Pie with Adult toons thrown in. If you want to see a penis under a wooden ruler this is your show. If your interested in a better coming of age comedy see http://www.amazon.com/Gotcha-Anthony-Edwards/dp/B00009AOBK/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid;=1326817301&sr;=8-1 2 Amazon stars for CHERRY.
1,A CD With No Name,"I was so glad to find a copy of Talking Through Pictures by Marc Jordan. I first bought this CD in 1988. Lost it and have wanted to replace it ever since. The problem is it is a poor copy of a great CD. Not a scratch on it was my first clue. It was probably a down loaded copy. It has no information on it. When I down loaded the whole CD on to Windows Media it gave me no info. as to what I had just copied to my PC. Therefore, I cannot find it when I look for it. It only shows up as ""Unknown-Artist"". I have other CD's that show the same thing because they are down loaded. I would have liked to have known this before my purchase. If you want a great artist's work and don't mind the tech crap and the audio dynamics being rather flat you might consider purchasing Marc Jordan's Talking Through Pictures. Thank you,Talking Through PicturesRabbi Da-vid"
3,"Some Good Ideas, but Lacking in Execution","In this, the final installation of the Starfarers series, we get a decent conclusion after a couple of rather dull books. If you like speculative science fiction, this one is not bad, but it's still lacking in the story-telling department.We're presented with some rather good ideas - the aliens in this book are interesting and manage to make you awe a little, and the final revelation of how the book's universe works is satisfying and make all the pieces of the puzzle fit nicely.That said, the ratio of words to plot development is much too high. The plot moves along at snail's pace, we get character interaction ad nauseam, and the prose is not very exciting.With better execution, this could have been a marvellous book - as it is now, it doesn't stand out in any way. There are lots of better books out there, but for fans of speculative science fiction, there may be one or two gems found among all the dust."
1,Baltimore & Ohio Steam Locomotives: The Last 30 Years 1928 -,This is a roster book in case you haven't heard. Roster books are not my 1st choice in books. If you want a good B&O roster book THIS one is for you.
5,Perky Pet always makes a good product,"Really, you couldn't ask for a more functional or more durable group of products than the line of Perky Pet hummingbird feeders. This saucer-shaped feeder has a built in ant moat. Very smart. Cleaning it fully is a breeze because the red top snaps off like a food container. Drawbacks? It is harder to see the contents from across the room, and it spills easier than the bottle-shape feeders during filling and placing. We like it very much!"
2,Tilts and spills,"I had high hopes for this design, ants, air pressure not forcing out liquid and nice looking. But... the feeder liquid and design of the tray cause the whole thing to tilt and spill solution. When tilted the birds can get food only from the lower side of the tray.The only way to solve this is with a large weight hanging down from the center like a long candle stuck in the bottom. That puts the center of gravity lower and pulls it back to a horizontal position. Thus two stars because you can fix it but only two stars as it shouldn't work this way!"
5,Excellent feeder!,"The hummingbirds love it and its super easy to clean, especially with the built in ant moat."
1,Junk by design,"feeder will not stay level, the bottom of the flat so it is like trying to carry water in a pizza pan. I have had the wind blow it off of the hook twice (in one week), the last time it broke hangar rod threads out of the plastic part. I now have it mounted on a pole and it works well. I wish I would have not wasted my money feeder. If you get it for under $3 including S&H and pole mount it, it may be worth it, not for me."
1,Pitiful design,"Although it looks as though it would be a better type of feeder - easier to clean - it is actually not a good design in use.It will move according to whatever disturbs it, and that causes the liquid to shift to one side or another, leaking out and falling to the deck or the yard, attracting bees and ants.We used it once - but only for 5 minutes."
4,Beautiful Horse,"This is a beautiful item. I only wish it was larger, for the money. My daughter, who is a horse lover, adores this. I bought this from LB Toys, via Amazon, and I must say they have the best customer service out there. When I called them there was NO recording. A REAL live person answered the phone to take my call (where do you get that now-a-days??). Shipping was super (arrived 11/27 when delivery was set for 12/3)."
2,VERY cheap design!,"These flashcards seem to have good information on them. However, they are only about the size of a business card and are VERY poorly construction. They are printed on very thin cardstock (I believe my home computer would work better!) and the ink quality is so poor there are SEVERAL cards on which the content cannot be read!It is a cheap deck of flashcards, though, so that is the one benefit."
2,"Women Who Hate Men, And Their Research?","I'm afraid that I wasn't as enthusiastic about this book as the other reviewers. The author hits on several good points with regard to identifying and understanding critical behavior on the part of men. Unfortunately, she then concludes that there's little or no hope that a marriage with such a partner can be salvaged. After reading this book, I can't help but wonder how many marriages it has ruined, which could have been saved. Marriage is a wonderful and precious union between two persons. When problems arise, we need to identify them, and then work to fix them. The answer isn't to assign blame, and then cut and run! It would be great to see a second edition of this book, but with a new section dealing with how to change things for the better once you have your spouse's attention."
1,This One Sinks Like a Rock!,"Yikes--where do I begin? There was not one well-developed character in this entire book! The plot begins promising enough, but the characters are so blah and undefined that I ended up not caring at all about what happened to them. Ms. Hershon spends page after page on mind-numbingly dull details that add absolutely nothing to the plot or characters. I saved this book to read on my vacation and was very disappointed. Read The Lake of Dead Languages instead--it is a thousand times better!"
2,"Started, not finished","I appreciate this as a freshman novel, but this author needed a better editor. With little exception, there is no character development. Some friends and I read it and compiled a LONG list of great character issues and plot twists that were introduced and then never referenced again. One more thing:the coincidences that allow the book to continue until it's long-overdue end are insulting to people of normal intelligence."
1,piece of junk broke on me and logitech will not replace it,"this keyboard is a piece of junk cause the printscreen button does not work, it goes off on its own.the logitech support people are totally unhelpful, they have me sit through 30 minutes of useless procedures just to tell me my keyboard cannot be replaced.the idiots who sold me this junk, were some 3rd party sellers on amazon, covered the PID number so i cannot get it replaced by logitech. now those con artists on amazon made a profit from selling me a faulty keyboard and theres nothing i can do cause i purchased it back in December 2008 and did not start having issues till about a week ago.i cannot even remove the positive feedback i left thembesides the random breakdown of the keyboard, its wireless range is unacceptable and the wireless usb connector is just too huge, it is a long wire connected to a big box."
3,Watch It For The Animals...,"Sure, the story is wacky and the characters are weak, but hey, those animals are grrreat! Clyde Beatty spends all of his time training and performing with his host of lions, tigers, leopards, and bears. So much so, that he doesn't even notice when his girlfriend leaves with her father on a quest for a legendary island, inhabited by both Asian tigers and African lions! Soon, Clyde takes off in a derigible, only to wind up on the same mysterious island! Enter the wild animals (yep, even bears) and Clyde's hypnotic gaze. Forget the dopey story and just enjoy this jungle-circus! Watch for an ultra-young Mickey Rooney (he's the kid with the dog) at the beginning..."
1,Awful Film Company,"The picture quality on the DVD is awful. This company seems to send out Awful products. The sound even washes out at time. The storyline and JMB are great, but the quality of the picture and the sound makes me think that this company doesn't care what type of quality product they sell. The company should be shut down until they improve their product.I also question Amazon for allowing this type of sleasy product to be sold on their site."
1,NORTHFORK DVD,DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OF TIME WITH THIS FILM..IT WAS ONE OF THE WORST I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME...THANK YOU
1,Dump This Movie Into The Reservoir!,"This is the worst movie I have seen in many, many years. It starts out with many promising elements: an interesting premise, an appealing cinematographic style, and some very decent acting talent. Unfortunately, it slides rather quickly into an inexplicably deep and wide abyss of boredom from which there is no hope of escape.The main culprit here is the awful script, which has absolutely no redeeming quality. Additionally, the director obviously has no idea of what he is actually trying to get across to the audience. And the costumes look like leftovers from Pee-Wee's Playhouse. All in all, it is dreadfully bad."
2,Put down the typewriter and step away,"The Polish brothers got a little too cute with this story. The movie was just a collection of images that were thrown together. Save your money on this one, folks."
2,OK the dog on stilts was cool,"but thats about it Dont get me wrong I try to get into these weirded out movies like ""Brazil"" where everything can be a metaphor for something else. Like when your talking to someone and they mention the big mac they had yesterday when an obese person walks by but its gotta MAKE SOME SENSE! C'mon folks 'Northfork' made none it was just a trippy flashback of times when the directors played with LSD in college. And the joke HAHAHAHAHAH. We've all heard it 'God says I already sent a boat and a helicopter dummy' did that have to be such a drawn out scene? No but it was because they were short on dialogue. It started out on paper as something that couldve been special but winded up with everyone being happy with Noltes, Woods, Hannah and Edwards performances which were well acted out pieces of insanity. 2 stars."
1,Awful - not even a fun bad movie - this SUCKED,"I like a lot of bad movies. I like a lot of quirky movies which are rejected by the mainstream. I love alegories, symbolism and the like.BUT THIS MOVIE SUCKED - it was so so so so bad. How was this movie made. Are they all on drugs? - That was two hours of my life which I will never get back; furthermore I feel like the $4.00 spent to rent the movie was stolen from me... man did this movie suck!"
3,The usual piano lesson book,This is the book my piano teacher recommended. It is the usual piano lesson book. No bells or whistles just the usual.
4,"nice glasses, shame about the packing","nice glasses, they have a waterford quality to them. the problem arose with shipping, insufficient packing materials. every time i recieved a shipment you could hear the tinkling of the glass as ups handed me the package. it took 2 seperate orders to get 12 large and 14 short glasses!"
2,Stinky Shipping,"I recieved this from my amazon wedding registry and when I tipped the box to show everyone at the shower, you could hear the tinkling of broken glass. My poor friend was embarassed."
1,Misleading Title for Golfers,"This is not the book for you if you want a history of golf tournaments at Pebble Beach. Who won the Pro-Am in 1991? Who finished in the Top 10 at the 1992 Open? When did Juli Inkster beat all the men Pros at the Spauling Invitation at Pebble Beach? If you want any Almanac info forget this book. If you want a book about Golf at Pebble Beach this is not your book. Also, there are far too pictures of Pebble Beach for the price of this book.I have played Pebble Beach and wanted a little more information on the Players that have played there not just the biography of the dirt.If I could return the book I would."
3,"Not too bad, but disappointed","This, and all of the ""Music for..."" series consist mostly of 1940's 'old-timey' recordings transferred to CD, with very little (if any) remastering. If you are looking for relaxing background music, this is not a very good choice. If you're on a budget, ""the intro collection"" box sets, also sold through Amazon, is much better."
3,Pretty awesome...,It's pretty awesome but I'm a bit skeptical of the longevity of this. Definitely a very cool birthday present for the right fan!
1,Review of Kindle Version of Institutes of the Christian Religion,"Up until now, I have not given a book a rating lower than 4 stars. However, this version of the Institutes does not contain a table of contents that allows links to either the books or chapters within books. Because I'm interested in using the Institutes as a reference to address specific topics, this download is useless to me.REVISION: Signalmanpublishing (www.signalmanpublishing.com) contacted me to offer a version with a table of contents. I received it and it works great. I give it 5 stars now."
1,Not a good deal,This item is way overpriced... you get one pad of 100 notes and it costs nearly ten dollars. You can do much better price-wise elsewhere.
5,Excellent Collection With Special Features,"Journey around the world with Dale Chihuly as he brings his grandest plans to fruition in this four-disc box set. Explore the relationship of nature and glass as Chihuly and his team work in a variety of outdoor locations, and then install glass among the lush flora at Chicago's Garfield Park Conservatory.

A truly comprehensive collection, the Chihuly DVD Collection is a globe-trotting adventure that leads to greater understanding of the man and his art.Each DVD is 60 minutes with an additional 30 minutes of special features."
5,Works as advertised,"This is my favorite body moisturizer -- the best one I can afford on my budget.Like the label says, it's not greasy and it does work best on damp skin. So keep it in the bathroom to use after taking a shower or washing your hands.Has a nice, subtle smell too."
5,Indispensible for all interested in American Cuisine,"I worked with Julia Child in the 1980s in Boston. This was one of her favorite books. I met Michael through Lydia Shire at Biba Food Hall--the restaurant I worked for then. He was then struggling to walk, but was gracious, kind and very funny to be with.He invented ""California Cuisine""--which is now thought to have sprung from something in the LA soil. It did not--it came from Michael Roberts, who is missed every day."
4,"Interesting, brings back memories of Battlefield Ghosts","I have done vast research on Civil War Battlefields and sites. I have seen many Ghostly Spirits on Va. Battlefields also at Gettysburg ,PA. They really do exsist. While exciting to see, it is also scary.This was a good book to read."
4,Good one for an expert but not for beginners,"Modern Cosmology is a subject which is constructed by bringing together the results from pretty much all the branches of Physics & Astronomy. Learning it thoroughly requires multiple sources AND multiple readings of the same source. I was advised to start with this book and I was unsatisfied during the first read. It presents only the final result with no details. But I read the preface and realized that this book is not meant for teaching Cosmology for beginners. However once you learn the fundamentals through the other sources, this serves as a wonderful compendium of all the very important results that one would want to organize in their memory. If you are a beginner and want to learn Cosmology in detail and not just a summary of results this is not the book for you, at least not yet. If you continue in Cosmology you would certainly want to buy this in future."
4,Great Author Good book,One of the Greatest Authors and this is a good book. Great for younger kids but even older people love it again and again.
3,Good Basic Oil Painting Book,This book gives good information about supplies and basic oil painting techniques but that is about all you can depend on. I am a prof artist and bought it as a beginner book for someone. It will take you thru about two paintings. If you have never painted in oil this would start you out.
5,Fantastic,Just as good as her first and I say the SAME thing.Not a great voice BUT fun all the same.
4,"Works well, range of signal ok","This AP is part of a large church network. What I wanted was an access point that would cover a large area. Setup was easy - let me also say I do not use setup software. I access the html interface and set the parameters I need for my small network. The AP holds signal strength and have experienced no drop of service or need to reset. I was hoping it would provide coverage to the floor below but that was wishful thinking. I do get a signal but too weak for most notebooks to access so I will be running more cable and installing another AP. This is integrated with a linksys/cisco router, a linksys AP and a Phantom IBoss firewall filter. They all work well together."
5,Honest portrayals of life,"Viewing people's problems is on one hand intrusive though enlightening for people who have similar situations going on in their lives. Shmuley has a way about him that ingratiates the family to him so that they canm wutg gus guidance, heal themselves. I have since purchased the book which has these and more stories which are also thought provoking."
3,Marina McBride Doll Not for Kids,"Although this new release from Barbie looks very much like the real life singer, the doll itself is not something I would recommend for a child under 12. The doll is dressed pretty sccantilly and is adorned with realistic jewlerly. It also comes with a bracelet appropriate for a teen. The short hair of this doll and tight clothing does not lend itself to childs play and is more suited to a serious doll collector or McBride fan."
3,Great Rumble...Horrible Undercard!,This Rumble was by far (In my opinion) the very best of all time. Here's 10 reasons:RUDE/HOGAN/WARRIOR/HART/SAVAGE/PIPER/ROBERTS/RHODES/PERFECT/DIBIASEDoes'nt get much better than that does it? Tony Schaivone who spent very little time in WWE calls the action with Jesse the Body my favorite commentator of all time.The undercard is where this PPV struggles. I think there is 4 matches along with a Brother Love interview w/ Sherri and Saphirre...Man was that terrible.Matches like Bossman VS Duggan and Bushwackers(WTF!) VS Rougeaus just make u wanna fast forward right through to the rumble. I own it but would'nt go higher than 15-18$'s for this. My favorite part of the Rumble is when only Hogan and the Warrior are left in the ring..Huge buildup to their match at Mania 6.
1,This book is Weak,"This book is a poor application of the KM subject. It has non-sensical terms like ""knowledge management server"" that would only make sense to a Boeing engineer..."
2,Useful but not necessary,"While the concept of this device is great, and it works quite well, it really isn't a necessary addition to the baby arsenal. If you feel inundated with baby stuff, you can leave this off the shopping list. A bowl of warm water works just fine."
3,"Some Good, Some Not","OK...we got Birdland out of this and that's good. But we also got Fantasy and that's not so good.We got Carnival and that's good because like it or not, it WAS a creative sound.But then, we got Stella By Starlight and that's not so good when you consider MF hated that tune (according to his biographer). And it showed.Still, MF as always delivers. His material...well....another story."
4,"""reader"" doesn't know what he's talking about","This guy below obviously has never been to Chicago. I'm sure it's a much better place than where he and his small mind were raised. Anyway, the book is great for both crime buffs and people with interest in Chicago, the greatest city in the world."
5,Perhaps the Best of the entire GU catalog...,"This CD is perhaps the best of GU's catalog along with Anthony Pappa, Danny Howells, Nick in Reykjavik, Sasha - SF, Oaky - NY. This is la obra maestra. If you like Dave... check out this disc along with Renaissance Desire. Zerotonine is an AMAZING track! James Holden's Horizons... WOW!!!! This CD is nice for trance/house lovers. It's beautiful. I've had this CD for years and it still gets play time. I wish Dave was still this good."
5,Wisdom at Work - Biblical perspective of Work,This was an excellent book as I used it to lead 10 other men in a weekly bible study. This study helped us refocus our minds as we realized that no matter what role we play we are ambassadors for our Lord.
3,All over the place...,"I used to be a huge fan of step. However my body rejected it after I had my son. This particur tape has a lower rating than I usually give Kathy Smith. She still has the same upbeat attitude that I love. I do think that this tape have difficult choreography. It is definitely for someone who is an advanced stepper. The scenery in this video is beautiful and the atmosphere is serene. Don't get caught up in the background, stay focused because Kathy has you all over the place."
3,"Great workout, lousy cueing","The video is presented in two 18-minute ""waves,"" each wave consisting of a slower-to-higher energy concept that tapers off near the end of the wave. Each wave ends with an approximate 5-minute weight lifting routine.The wave concept works very well for getting the heart rate and sweat going and the weights add a great sense of recovery while still maintaining a good heart rate.Unfortunately, Kathy's cueing in the second wave is so unforgivably bad that I felt as though I had missed the routine training and found myself stopping to see what the heck she was doing. This wave ruins an otherwise great workout. Some poor dubbing tries to make up for the lack of cueing, but the swerving camera angles make it virtually impossible to keep up the first few times I did the routine. Once you have the routine more or less memorized, this won't be as much of a problem, but if you're easily frustrated, pass on this tape."
3,Spotty At Best And Only For Die-Hard Fans,"Unfortunately this is nowhere near as great as their earlier effort ""Willie And Waylon"", released around 1976. Most of the material here are overblown pop covers the likes of Jimmy Webb's ""Mr Shuck And Jive"" and Otis Redding's ""Sittin' At The Dock Of The Bay"". If you haven't already, pick up on ""Willie and Waylon"", (recently reissued and unabridged) or the outstanding ""Outlaws"" collection, featuring Tom Paul Glasser and Jessie Coulter. This one is spotty at best and recommended only for die-hard fans."
3,Don't Crush That Dwarf,"Still funny, but somehow it was funnier when I was in college around 1972- I have no idea why. Nostalgia?"
2,ho hum,The good thing about this CD is it exposes the brave listener to relatively uncommon pieces. I find the performances very unimaginative and tiresome. It is a good cd to get a feel for pieces you want to play better. I don't suggest buying it though. Find a friend who has it or a library. Or you could buy it and return it due to poor sound quality!
1,Not worth it,This book just tells you that you should leave it up to someone else to do the work for you they tell you to buy kits but not were to buy kits. Not even worth the money i wouldnt bother with this book all the cars in it are classics anyways.
1,Very lightweight,This is a book for someone who only wants to buy premade upholstery and install it. Not helpful if you want to sew yourown.
4,A fun filled learning expierience,"This book really helped me in the getting aquainted with my new iBook. Let's face it, I am no computer genius, but now I at least understand the basic computing skills I need. Hey, it helped me get onto this website, so it taught me something. Pogue doesn't doesn't just spit techno-babble at you, he teaches you how to do the tasks required. My personal favorite part of the book are the great cartoons at the beginning of each section."
3,iBook rules - in the early years,"The book is fine. Well written. For my taste it simply doesn't go far enough. I expected something a bit deeper. However, a good value for those of us who have inherited a 2004 iBook and have been PC users all our lives. Three stars only because of personal preferences for something more detailed. But again - a good value."
1,An offensive ripoff,"The Deadline label strikes again with this blatant attempt at a money grab. This is not a greatest hits disc, just a brutal remix job of the band hits. Tamie remixes these tunes to the point of obliteration. How bad is it? Well put it this way, the one and only time I listened to it, I had to check the friggin' song list to figure out what tune they were attempting to play.This disc made me swear off anything else from the Dealine label, with the only exception being Mike Tramp's Remembering White Lion disc - on that disc, Mike Tramp had some good ideas and a fresh approach at these songs... something Taime should have taken note of."
4,Relaxing and calming,This man is so talented and pleasant.His music is the most enjoyable and relaxing I have found in a long time. The DVD's are fantastic as well. To see so many people enjoying some quality music and truly dancing in the aisles.You just have to try it to believe it.Give it a try CD or DVD. :D
4,"Solid, a few corners cut",This is a more than acceptable organizer. But there are minor points that the buyer might want to know.No flap on top. Smead makes a selling point out of this! But I think most people want a flap - you can always cut it off it you don't need it.A little sloppy on the cosmetics. The paper lining the front and back is glued on and some of the edges look like they might be peeling. This would have NO effect on the organizer as a whole - just looks a little sloppy and I might have that one bad apple in the batch.It IS very strong. The tyvex panels in front and back are overkill. Nice. I think the parts that wear the most (side panels) are reasonably strong. Good enough.It'll probably last for decades.
1,"It is BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD.","This is one of the worst of videos I have ever seen on the Royal Family. Who cares what the average person on the street thinks--and the same average people on the street shown two and three times? Is this a video about Prince William, or about what people think about Prince William?"
4,Scary good,A lot more analysis in this one than just the story lines of his other books but well worth the read if you're really interested in the subject and want to add more depth to your understanding.
5,long ride home,mr gear cannot write a bad book. i have read and have all his and wifes books. waiting for his next one to be printed and mailed to me i think in feb. 2011.
4,Buy several or you may not get one!,"For those of you who spent any time in the military, this is not an issue item, but a knock-off. It is a little thicker and heavier, but I am hoping that a few cycles in the wash will break it down into the super comfortable blanket that I am hoping for. It looks promising, but only time will tell.For those of you with nothing to compare it to, get past the camo. This blanket will never leave your couch/chair/bed or wherever you spend your time reading or watching TV. We have several in the house now because mine kept being stolen when I got up for some reason."
5,Excellent product!,I already have one of these from my army days (1987-1992) but this one is much thicker and warmer than my old one. Very nice.
5,"Blanket for warm and cool, great for Iraq soldiers","I bought this for my husband when he went to Iraq, it keeps you warm AND cool (strange but true) and it folds up to very small. I just bought 2 more for my sister (headed to Iraq) and myself because I love this liner as a blanket! We use them camping and pretty much all the time."
5,GREAT album!,"Five Iron Frenzy's Reese Roper, Dennis Culp, and Keith Hoerig did a great job on this album! Its a astro-pop thing. Spacey sounding. Definately NOT Five Iron's ska if that's what you're looking for. It talks about more serious and darker issues. but then it shows how we can put our hope and trust in GOD no matter what. Really good sounding album!"
5,Sweet!,I love this CD! the music is nice and cheers me up! i defanitly think that everyone who like christian rock get this CD! its totally kool! - Joe Cactus
1,Not working in UK!,"This DVD would not play in the UK - it says 'wrong region'.Very disappointing - it should have said this when I bought it,Not happy!!!"
4,Mopar Power,"I first viewed this movie in the early seventies and was most impressed by the powerful Dodge Challenger and Charger from the film. Mopars from that era were pretty scarce out here back then. The storyline was a bit sketchy in places, but the car chase scenes were good, I am pleased that they didn't destroy genuine musclecars. One of my friends was until this movie a one-eyed Ford man, he converted to Mopars and has stayed with them since. The 90's remake of the movie has a better ending, it doesn't leave you with the stunned empty feeling that the original does."
3,Reviw Vanishing Point Movie,"I saw this movie long time ago when it first came out in early 70s. I remember likeing this movie then, but could not remember much of the movie details. When I saw it this time I was less impressed. Dodge Challanger was an inpresive car then and is now, and I wish I could afford to buy one now. The acting was good, but I did not like the ending. I am now a different person 40 years older and I may not like now what I liked then. All and All this movie is OK, not great."
5,The ultimate car chase movie,"I saw this movie when I was 19 years old and loved it then (a long time ago). Although it has nudity in it, it is still an exciting movie to watch."
4,I don't know why I like this movie.,"I can't really pinpoint what it is about this movie that makes me like it. There are no really spectacular stunts, the story is very vague, the acting low-key, it seems more like a series of short vignettes rather than one full story from beginning to end. Perhaps simply because it is a cult movie that a lot of people never heard of. I don't know. Anyway, everyone who buys the DVD in widescreen should know that in comparing it with the fullscreen VHS, it appears that Vanishing point was originally filmed in the 4:3 aspect ratio (the same as TV) and the film's top and bottom were matted to give the ""Flat"" aspect ratio of 1.85:1. So in other words, this is one of those rare instances where you actually see LESS of the picture in the widescreen version! The transfer on the DVD also does NOT look better that the VHS version, in fact, it looks worse! Rating is for the film itself, not the DVD version."
1,Hate this film,"I LIKE car movies, but this script was JUST awful. Boring. My buddy thought so too. We both like Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles) and wanted to like this film.Minus the nude girl on the Honda 250 (I think) there's not much here to watch.Go rent ""Christine"" (from the Stephen King book). MUCH better script, MUCH better movie, and you not only get LOTS of 58 Fury shots, BUT there's a late 60's Charger AND a 68 Camaro. Close your eyes when they bash the Fury to death and squash the Camaro in the gas station.Also you get the gorgous Leigh. Who is still gorgeous today, I hear.Go buy the Christine book/movie. Your money will be better spent. This film's like trying to watch ""Easy Rider"" sober."
1,Vanishing - To assume the value zero,"Can I please get my money back? This movie is terrible. There is one thing that I have never done as an avid movie watcher, and that one thing is fall asleep during a movie. Bad or not, I haven't fallen asleep on a movie....Until Vanishing Point somehow found it's way into my theater room. I'm telling ya, whenever I'm having a night where I just can't fall asleep, I'll pop this terrible movie in and in 10 minutes I'm sleeping like a baby. I bought this movie for Five Dollars and I feel like I got the short end of the stick here. I feel flat out robbed. With a weak American Dollar, paying $5 for this movie is a bit too much.The acting, chases and the Nascar plot sent this movie spinning around in circles, literally as the disc flew across the room. I don't understand the positive reviews of this movie. What is there to like? Save your five dollars please. Don't be suckers people."
1,display doesn't work!,I'm an avid **mac** fan and have been so for years. I have never been so disappointed with Apple as I am now. Hopefully Apple will soon acknowledge and fix what appears to be a serious manufacturing defect in its emacs. I will explain below.My sister just bought an emac for college and the display didn't work! If you check on the apple support message boards you will see that this seems to be a common problem. Upon start up there's a flash in the display and then the diplay goes blank. I would suggest you stay away from emacs until there is official word that the problem is solved and furthermore that this solution is reflected in the experiences of new buyers who post their views online.
3,It's okay,I have bought every book I could find on Oxygen Therapy. This was the least helpful. Ed McCabe's Flood Your Body with Oxygen was much better and so was The One-Minute Cure.
1,Common Sense Prevails,"This product didn't bring much of anything to the party -- it is so brief, all that is addressed are a few common sense items. Not at all worth the money I paid. I am not sure free is worth the price for the lack of content."
5,The Great Escape,"I join with the others in saying I loved this book as a child. My copy is rather batter and worn. I was reading it to my niece the other day and thought it would make a great birthday gift. Too bad it's out of print. Guess she'll just have to come over more often to read it, because I won't let my old copy go."
3,OK for Kids,Product arrived on time in excellant shipping condition. This was a two sided DVD and only one side would play. After a thorough cleaning with Disk Doctor the second side played just fine. This should have been done before it was sold as it was a used DVD.
2,I rate this price range a 1 but i personally rate this movie a 5 stars the problem is,I don't care that its a OOP DVD because that does not justify ripping people off so they pay a high price to get this. I remember when it came out on DVD i bought it but someone stole mine and its a very good movie. But i wont be buying if the price is jacked too high. it just means greed when people jack up prices to make a profit. I don't care how hard to find it really is because ripping people off will not make you honest at all.
5,stars wars classic,My children and I watched this when they were little. Its a very family friendly and entertaining film. Now I purchased it to watch with my 11-grandchildren!
1,Not as advertised,Disappointed since it only had the first 4 episodes and not the full season as advertised. Would not recommend purchasing this unless you only want to see part of the BB season 3.
5,WOW.,"I am a TRUE big brother addict, and owning this season was only natural for me. I really wish BB2 was on DVD I would buy that in a second!!I ordered the 'free shipping' that was going to take 2-6 business days and expected to see the package in the mail next week. I ordered the DVD set on a Sunday and received it 3 days later on the Wednesday.I've been watching the first disk and so far I'm super impressed.. a little bummed that it's censored, and a little bummed that they dont have more special features or deleted scenes, but it's totally worth it for me as I love the show so much.I'll likely buy the BB4 dvd when that comes out too.One of the disks was loose when I opened the packaging but they were all alright, no scratches.I recommend it for any TRUE big brother fans. :)"
1,Garbage.....,"You like to watch people make total you know whats of themselves in a show that looks more like a nightmarish cross between a music video and an informerical, then this series is for you. If you do not like to watch people do things that make you sick to your stomach, then avoid this series like you would avoid a smelly garbage truck."
5,Beautiful and original,Another wonderful book for my grandchildren. Pictures were gorgeous and they keep reading them over and over. Thank you.
1,Wrong Product and search key,"Picture is for Vitamin K and that was what was shipped to me. But search key was Artemisinin and that is what is in the product description. If you key in super artemisinin you get this. Beware, description does not seem to match the product shown or shipped."
4,Master Levels for DOOM II,"I have this and at one time I could access what was on the disk. That was in like 96 do not know?P.C.s have changed. I can not get into the disk, for many, Zdoom is the platform. I am not Zdoom savvy.It was a great resource at the time, I can not access the information on this disk, at this time. Rumored others with like problems with said title.Thank you.Postscript:I was prompted to review this product. I hope a review with information surfaces."
2,average,wasn't what I was after but my fault for not reviewing harder. next time i'll spend more time in review
3,"good advice for experts, not for beginners","This book is certainly worth the 10 or 12 bucks you pay for it. If you are creative or talented, it is pretty useful. It lacks helpful hints, and has no real step by step stuff, just alot of vague stuff to get you started. Like I said, it is worht the 10 or 12 bucks though."
5,Perverse and Entertaining,"Well, there's nothing like Savage Streets. Depraved, despicable, loads of nudity...in short, probably the greatest B movie ever made. You'll also enjoy the 2nd disc which has several entertaining interviews (the Robert Dryer interviews are alone worth the price)."
1,Beware: Item No longer Available - Shipping Packets Instead!,"I ordered this item expecting to get the 1 liter (35 oz) bottle of water additive. This item is no longer available as Venta is now only selling the 10 pack boxes of premeasured water additives. Grady's is shipping this box instead of the bottle, claiming that it is an equivalent. In point of fact, it is not equivalent, as the box provides 10 treatments while the bottle provided 20 for the same price! I asked them to send me another box of the packets if they are, in fact, offering an equivalent, but Grady's offered to refund my money after returning the unopened 10 pack box. I elected to return the item for a refund, rather than paying twice the price per treatment."
1,Bad Experience,"It was a bad experience.I had ordered from abroad.Seven months remaining shelf life, and you had to sell stuff.So happy?"
1,It is over the expiration date.,I bought 3 bottle and got it last week.I found that the expiration date is Dec/12. It is before the order date.
2,"Very small, odd dimensions, unstable on counter","I just received these bowls as a birthday gift. I was hoping for a set of metal mixing bowls to replace the Tupperware ones I had been using for making cakes. While these bowls are of medium weight (for a stainless steel set), they are almost comically small. I am not entirely sure how well I can mix a cake in even the largest one, and haven't a clue what I would use the smallest one for. They are narrow and deep and I fear will not lend themselves to a hand mixer very well. Worse, they do not sit flat on the counter, and are wobbly and unstable.I detest returning items, but these have to go back."
4,Revere bowls are great!,"My mother-in-law has a set of these bowls she has had for years, and I decided to get a set. They are very nice and I am sure I will get many years use out of them!"
2,Requested new lid because one was split.,"Requested new lid because one was split.The plastic cover for the smallest bowl had a split on the edge. I requested that the seller replace this lid. They said that they would look into it, but that's the last I heard from them."
4,Great Bike. Paid 49 for it.,"This bike was so easy to put together. It took me less than 10 minutes. Great design, too. It's like two bikes in one. You could ride it like a tricycle or like a big wheel when you flip it over. Easy to flip over, too."
1,fades and tips,"did not like this product, i purchased for my granddaugher, and it quickly faded and very easily tips over. returned it"
5,Perfect size and well made,"Ordered this for my daughter (almost 1 1/2 years), and she LOVES IT. She is the perfect size for it! The age recommendation says up to 5 years old, which I don't believe though. I think a kindergarten aged kid would get tired of this pretty quickly. It is great for 1-3 though!"
4,A fun playhouse that is easy on the back.,I bought this Treehouse for my daughter and the best thing I can say about it is how easy it was to put together! I trudged outside with a screwdriver and plans to spend hours on this but was finished with it in about 30 minutes. My daughter has loved it and we moved it next to her inflatable pool so she can slide down into it. Great playset that has already given us some great memories.
2,2 year old too tall already,"We didn't get to really try this toy out for more than one afternoon, as my 34"" tall 2 year old was entirely too big for it. She didn't even have to use the stairs to get in to it. She couldn't stand under the top and look through the periscope, and she didn't have enough room to turn around to use the slide to get down. I think a better age range would be 18 mo to 2 or 3 years. We returned it and ordered a slide for the yard instead."
2,Not what they say it is,We ordered it for our son that was 18 months old it said it was for a child 1-1/2 to 5 years old.once we put it together he could not stand up in it the space from floor to the roof was not tall enough for him to stand in.We shiped it back for credit.
3,Flawed Genius,"I always look forward to reading new Foxtrot, and was really pleased to read this, but at the same time extremely annoyed it was so small. Plus hacking off the pre-gag and de-colourising the sunday strips strikes me as a bit of a con. They could have at least waited until they had more stips to make it up to the normal size. The content is great, but the presenatation is despicable. This is a rip-off. Wait for a collection."
2,well...,"ok, the pro's- the pattern and image appears well applied and it is a cool retro funky imagethe cons the metal is THIN, how thin, VERY thin, like dont tap your fingers on it, OH you just dented it thinand the hinges are so weak, which (insert sarcasm) they probably have to be so they dont bend the tin metal, that I expect one good tug and they are coming off.and when you go to close the lid it torks and takes two hands to situate on the base so it will latch.Im just really disappointed, i expected more, but this is worse than ""novelty"", you are not going to be able to put anything but cotton balls in it, or you are going to dent it and tweat it and rip the handle off. FORGET using it for lunch. such a shame, why could they have upgraded the thickness of the metal, charged us another buck and made this useful. and the domed lid? thats just for show, no latch for a thermos, (not that it could hold it anyways)so disappointed, no funcionality at all."
5,the best cd,"This cd is amazing. It has the best mix of spanish club music and american dance music. it has four cds which makes it a great deal. it has everything on it from the hit ""la bomba"" to ""oops i did it again."" i listen to this cd for hours it is amazing!!!!! definitely worth the money!!!!"
5,Pretty Amazing,Mike makes it looks SOOOOOO easy. His ability to improvise on complicated meters is simply amazing. What a drummer.He breaks things down; then builds it up as his embellishments become more and more complicated.
3,"fast delivery,","I bought this food for my 80lb Staffy Terrier. The food was shipped the same day I bought it and I recieved it within 3 days. The food however did not sit well with my dog, he usually does not have sensitivites to food but this food made him sick. I tried to ease him onto the food over a few days and it did not do much to help he was consistently sick until I changed his food"
4,Good book,"It is a well known fact that prayer is therapeutic - however many of us don't pray on a regular basis because we are either not disciplined, don't completely believe in it or are ashamed. In my case it was a combination of all three. The author shows simple techniques of praying and also suggests simple excercises to grow spiritually. No jargons, no preaching - it is a simple straightforward book."
5,English/German Subtitles,"I am writing this review with reference to the one written by Sandra W. from Chicago in December 2000. I am pleased to inform her that I have the German version of the Film on VHS. Please inform Sandra that I can send it to her. My Mobile phone number is 07773 619826. My Home number is 020 7 582 6134. I live in London, UK. When I was young, I loved watching the Tales From Europe series on TV. Its wonderful to know some of the stories are now available on VHS Video. I hope ""Cinderella"" will also be available soon.From Miss Mary Callaghan"
4,Excellent material...lackluster presentation,"As most of the material in this set has been out of print for a bit, this collection is essential for those hoping to complete their collection of Samhain recorded material, and the re-mastered editions make it worthwhile even if you already own all of this great material. So why did I only give it 4 stars? Every CD (5) comes in a flimsy CARDBOARD sleeve, like the ones most promo or free CD's come in. No jewel cases here folks, just cheap cardboard."
4,Im happy with it,"I like this set. It has alot of good stuff included. Just the fact alone that it's a bigger box then the Misfits' coffin box is pretty funny...seems like Glenn is just trying to slap the Misfits in the face by saying ""HA!, my set is bigger!"" The CDs sound good, but the video is kinda cheap. But for the price, you get alot of cool stuff. Misfits are better though."
5,Bob,"I own a retail software company that installs POS software for customer and sales tracking. The book was fantastic and we in fact added a customer profile section to our software as a result of the great ideas in the book. I also visited Mitchells in CT and the store is even more impressive than the book. The book is a must read for anyone seriously building their business one customer at a time. No matter what your previous thoughts on customer service, Jack Mitchell has put together the ultimate sumary of what real customer service should be."
1,Awful,"I chose this camera over the Nikon Coolpix S200 because of the all weather casing. Biggest mistake of my life. The photos are overexposed, and only come out in focus if you always use the flash. I've adjusted the ISO settings, tried different modes, but nothing seems to make these pictures better. I chose this as a replacement for my Canon Powershot S1 IS. And I have decided to return it, because the pictures are of such bad quality. It is sleek and compact, but the picture quality could have been achieved by an entry-level digital camera, not something that is of this standard and supposed quality."
1,"Bad (as in ""The Opposite of Good""","For those who can read and have, therefore, read Lovecraft's short story ""The Color Out of Space"" (not a short novel as described in the ad) you will notice from the description that this is not a faithful adaptation. Instead (as with so many of these) it is taking a Lovecraft story, having it re-written by a much less talented and inventive writer, and then putting the resultant mess on film.If you admire H. P. Lovecraft's work, don't buy this. You'd be better off buying the Boris Karloff, Nick Adams version 1965's DIE, MONSTER, DIE which, at least, comes closer to capturing the brooding horror of Lovecraft's style than THIS."
2,where were the gnomes?,"This was just a VERY soft porn. You hardly see anything in this movie that would make it a horror movie. Even if your in it for the nudity, the movie gets boring, generic and uninteresting the more it creeps along. verdict: good picture quality, average sound quality, Bad acting, really fake blood/death scenes, and a tiny bit of s&m....."
2,Incoherent plot with laughable dialogue.,"The acting in this movie stinks, laughably. Even Tara Reid can't save this film. What, Reid's a scientist because she puts on glasses? She looks more like a gym trainer. Is Christian Slater any smarter?The direction is almost as bad as some Ed Wood movies. The movie may have had a science fiction plot, but the film hardly explored any part of its plot. The film is not only bad, it's sometimes boring, only stimulated by the amusement to scriptlines horridly carried out and meaningless action. Mostly, this film incriminates its director.I give this movie two stars out of five. This film at least had some visuals. I didn't hate its stupidity as much as that other movie also based on a videogame, ""Resident Evil: Apocalypse"" which I considered the worst movie of its year."
1,Crap in the dark,"I haven't seen a movie this bad since Starship Troopers 2. Most bad movies have at least a comedy factor or a hot chick that helps you sit through it. Christian Slater kept doing this tough guy squinty eye action stare that kept annoying me. Tara Reid stretched her acting ability to it's max, trying to be something other than a college movies love interest. This director also did BloodRayne......go figure. Bloodrayne was the first movie i've seen where there was a lot of action and blood and i was still bored out of my mind.This movie had bullet time?!?!? A horror movie.......yeah. This movie is plain stupid and the next movie Uwe Boll directs should have a disclaimer that warns patrons about his crapiness. Is crapiness a word? well it should be."
1,SUCKS !!!,"I want my money back ! This movie was a waste of money , plastic(for the DVD), and my time . This peace of crap is one of the worst movies i've ever seen . Only give this to your worst enemy as a secret santa gift !!!!!!!"
1,WOW.,"I honestly don't think I've ever seen a movie, read a book, or heard a song this bad. Poor execution in plot, acting, dialogue, and action all add up to one mess of a movie. It's a bit sad when you get more entertainment from the song in the end credits than the whole rest of the movie. Seriously....don't waste the money or the time on this movie. I honestly can't think of a single good thing to say about it."
1,Wake me when it's over.,"I was suckered into this film because Suffocation, Bloodbath and Dying Fetus were on the soundtrack and like a fool I thought that they would be playing death metal during the film...wrong.There was no death metal rocked out during the film or any good acting, writing or direction for that matter. I honestly cannot figure out what audience the makers of this steamer were aiming at. Eight-year-old boys? Nobody else would even like this [...] in the least. I hate myself for watching the whole thing.As far as the plot goes you got Tara Reid as an archeologist. Enough said."
2,worst movie in a long time,"Now im going to be specific it sucks stay away from it the acting is horific.its not even scary, I wish i'd never seen it I dont even know why christian slater even wanted to waste his talent on this stupid film.Trust me once you see it youll wish you hadent.It sucks to high heaven. I can hardely discribe how bummed out I was when I saw this trash."
1,Will be retro cult classic in year 2030....,"Hahahaha...laughed so hard at this dog. Probably sounded like a good script, but the result is a farce. As we laugh at our parent's 1950s b&w scifi flicks, this will no doubt be retro comedy entertainment in 2030. Story is as incomprehensible as it is implausible. Hahahaha...."
1,Save your time and your money ...,"QUICK THOUGHTSI've always thought that Christian Slater was a good actor who always got stuck in bad movies and this movie is no exception. He does the best he can with the script he was given, but still it is a movie based on a video game that should have stayed a video game. The acting is sub-par, the script unbelievable (which may explain the acting) and just not really an entertaining movie. So my recommendation is that you save your hard earned money (and an hour and a half of your life) for another movie.QUICK SYNOPSISEdward Carnby (Christian Slater) is a paranormal investigator and ex-member of a government run paranormal response team called 713. He has recently recovered an artifact that is the key to opening a door to dark and evil world. There are powers that be that would like to get a hold of this artifact and sends his monsters to retrieve it. Ed must find a way to stay alive and keep the creatures from behind the door from coming into our world."
3,Not Bad For a Staight Piece of Entertainment,"I never saw the video game so can't compare but this movie wasn't bad as this type goes. Not a seat gripper all the way through and a bit predictable in parts with enough gore to please the larger crowd. I liked Christian Slater's character and his delimma but I would have liked more info on the who, the what and the why. The ending was too reminiscent of Resident Evil and other movies. Not a WOW of a movie but I'd watch it again."
1,Oh my...,"Just about unwatchably bad. Bad writing, bad effects, bad acting, bad Christian Slater wearing a bad wardrobe, and bad, bad, bad Tara Reid. Slater looks pissed off that he's stuck in this dreckfest, but Reid just looks confused, like she's managed to sound out her lines using hooked on phonics but can't quite figure out what they mean. This is unfortunate, given that she's been cast against type as an archeologist. Ooops! Bad!"
4,"Great for exam 1, adequate for exam 2","The book was excellent prep for the first exam. While it did prepare me adequately for the second exam, I felt the material could have been covered in more depth, especially the section on NIS. If you know the material in the book, however, there is no reason not to pass both tests."
3,It will pass you SA I but not SA II,"This book is good if you like the ""fast-food"" style of getting certified. By simply studying the SA I section of the book, you will pass with comfort.However, the SA II section is by far inadequate if you are thinking of reading no other materials.So I would suggest people get this book and pass the SA I exam first, and look elsewhere for the SA II exam."
1,Coleman Cable's low temp. ext. cord,"This stuff wasn't flexible at room temp - It may be ok, at 90&#8457;+ - but, I wouldn't bet my life on that."
1,extremely poor,I never received the book that i ordered. the only good thing that happened to me about buying from this seller was that they actually gave me my money back. I wouldn't recommend ordering from them cuz you won't get ur purchase anytime soon or even at all...
1,NOT JOURNEY'S STEVE PERRY,"This is NOT from JOURNEY former lead singer, STEVE PERRY. PLEASE BEWARE. AMAZON IS DOING A MAJOR DISSERVICE BY NOT SHOWING THE IMAGE OF THIS ARTIST or CD. I DID NOT REVIEW THIS CD, THE ONE STAR RATING IS FOR AMAZON."
1,Originally confused,"I saw this title in a Tower Records store at an electronic album search device. I was shocked to think that Steve Perry had a CD out that I did not hear about. That system also did not have any image of the product. Apparently, there is another recording artist named Steve Perry, and Amazon and every other search engine should make the distiction between Steve Perry from Journey and the other one. I am glad that someone alerted me to the confusion. Shame of Amazon for not. (My one star is for all the electronic search engines, and Amazon, that do not distinguish between Steve Perrys)"
3,Too fragile for shipping and everyday use,"These glasses are very pretty to look at, very delicate and simple. I think they would be nicer if they weren't so fragile - but maybe the nature of the form just doesn't allow it. Either way, it's a bit dicey to ship these, one arrived completely smashed and others had small chips and bits missing. Too bad - I liked how they look very much."
5,beautiful glasses,"I was looking for some drinking glasses that would go great with the plates and flatware and other decor of my kitchen. These fit perfectly! Both sizes of the glasses are just right, and they look so classy with a well-set table. I found this same set of glasses in a retailer store for at least $10 more than the price I paid online -- so I got a great deal! The delivery was even quicker than expected, and they were packaged so well that every glass arrived in perfect condition! I would definitely recommend this Libbey Martello beverageware set!"
1,They break so easily!!,"These glasses look pretty cool, but they break really easily. I bought these 2 years ago, and I have 3 of the 16 glasses left. If I am hand washing one in the sink and I knock one over (not drop it, just knock it over from a standing position), it breaks. Such garbage. I should have spent more money and gotten better quality glasses, but I guess I got what I paid for."
4,Good glasses for day-to-day use,"Totally satisfied with the purchase. The small glasses are good for day-to-day use, they are sleek and fits well in the hands. I am not sure how to use the big glasses, they are bigger than I expected."
3,Fiestaware is wonderful but...,I ordered 4 of these bowls from Amazon to complement my growing Fiesta collection. One arrived broken despite being wrapped and the other 3 appear to be seconds. There are pinholes in the glaze and the color does not extend to the bottom center of the bowls. Perhaps I got a bad batch but check them carefully when they arrive if you order. Don't let this review deter you - the sunflower color is beautiful.
4,Overpriced on Amazon! Retails for less at craft stores!,"This kit retails for $14.99 at most craft stores - Joann's, Michael's, Hobby Lobby. And with most of those you can use a 40% off coupon from the Sunday paper to get it even cheaper."
2,Be Aware Of Dated Reviews!,"Many of these reviews are accurate when it comes to the inadequacy of this kit for the Wilton Method cake decorating classes. The kit is still a value for what it contains, and the one thing that it does contain that you must have is the class ""text"". When considering if you wish to purchase the kit from your local craft store or from Amazon keep in mind that many of these reviews are VERY dated and the prices that they reference at the local craft stores are long since gone. The frequently mentioned price of $19.99 is gone! The kit is $34.95 at all the local Michael's stores in the St. Louis area. Even if you use a 40% off coupon it will bring it down to about $21 dollars. Just wanted to share so that you can make an informed decision with current information."
3,"Definately worth it, but not all inclusive","I am in the first course for cake decorating and I did not actually buy this kit, as I already had most of the tips already. At my local craft store this kit is 24.99, but I could have purchased it with a 50% off coupon to drop the price. I agree that you need much more than what this kit includes to take this course. It is a bit diappointing. I hope that in future courses the cost does not keep rising!"
5,Outstanding In-depth study of the US Constitution,"You will know what the founding father's intended when they drafted our nation's constitution. Learn about the participants in the constitutional convention. Study over 270 principles that the founders systematiclly included in the constition, illustrated by quotes and anecdotes from the constitutional convention in the participants own words. A must read."
2,I'll never read another of these!,You can read the synopsis elsewhere. I just want to comment on things that drove me crazy about this book. The author has her character give tips on raising cats that are SO wrong. She has her main character change clothes 7 times/day. The sweet as sugar main character has a really foul mouth at times & the ending left about 5 sub-plots up in the air with no hint as to how they turned out.
3,Good Story with Mini History Lesson,"My opinion of this book was that the story kept my interest enough to finish the book, but I did find it lacking in the passion and thought some line were repetitious. I liked the character enough to just finish the book but I am not inspired to read the next book."
5,Great Is In The Title,"A great album as the title makes clear. Stylistically, this is Lorez at her best. Listen to her version of ""Somewhere Over The Rainbow."" Perhaps, not a Jazz song for the purists per se, however, this rendition is classy and refined and oh so sweet!I imagine many Jazz singers of today have attemted to copy the vocal stylings of Lorez's delivery with the inflections and vocal nuances. These attributes came naturally to Ms. Alexandria as she sings the ten contained classics."
5,Great extension cord for yard work,I used this cord with my yard tools /mower as an addition to my 100 ft 12/3 cord so I can reach the periphery of my yard . No loss of power or excessive tool heat is noted. I on't think they sell a 150 ft 12/3 cord at Amazon or I would have got that instead.
1,"right product at wrong price,and wrong product at right price","I got a wrong product: 25f cord instead of 100f cord.They listed the 100f cord at wrong price(lower price)by mistake.So they did not honor the price, they sent me different product instead.(cheaper and shorter one)"
1,Do not buy this one,This product is not worth the price. It actually is worse than my old and much lighter 100' cord. I am not sure of the size but it weighs substantially less than the Coleman - it is 20+ years old. I wanted to use this for my air compressor. While the smaller wire will run it the Coleman will not - so I spent more money for the larger wire and the extra weight to haul around and it will not do the job. Bummer. I should return it but after paying the freight and all the hassle it is not worth it. Probably will not be buying Coleman products for a while.
2,Not worth the money,"This book is overpriced and not worth the money. For the $77.00 I paid for this paperback book brand new, I expected a lot more then what I got. There are only 8 pages of color plates, the other illustrations contained were crude. While the printed information was indeed useful, it is in no way worth the listed price! In my opinion the GIA lab manual is just as helpful! Buy this book used and save your money."
3,Could be an interesting start,"Baxter has obviously read the non-SciFi author Edward Rutherford's books Sarum and London. The similarities on nearly all levels are too coincidental. Injecting a Sci-Fi dimension into a Rutherford model could actually be a lot of entertainment, but that remains to be seen as there's not much of a SciFi component developed in this first installment. I like the story approach well enough to try the next Baxter episode.I'll buy book #2"
3,enlightening but turgid,"this would be a good read for a history class, bringing alive a milieu little known to most. Saying this is better than a history textbook is faint praise. Love the premise but I had to push through to the end, rather than be drawn effortlessly. I felt virtuous having read the whole thing, but not pleased."
1,More rubbish from this formerly promising novelist,"I have completely turned 180 degrees from being a fan of Baxtor to absolutely loathing the garbage he's been writing in recent years. He had a good run early on, but has totally lost touch with his base. I loved Ring, The Time Ships, Flux, all the way up to Vacuum Diagrams, which seems to have been a turning point in his career--for the worst. This novel, like all of his recent work, suffers from very weak character development, a highly suspect plot, way too many personal motivations injected into the story, questionable and outdated physics (such as his refusal to give up the preposterous multiverse theory, which Hawking refutes), and his obsession with explicit sexual scenes (a sure sign of a writer's demise). I will never read another ridiculous novel by this former author again."
1,did not get item as described,"The decription says it is a 9x5 loaf loaf dish. I was thrilled. I have been looking all over to find one that size in glass. I was so mad and disappointed when I opened the box and it was 8.5 x 4.5. That wasn't what I ordered. And yes when baking bread there is a difference. I am still waiting on my postage-paid return label so I can ship this back. This would have been a great deal, except I already have the 8.5 x 4.5 pans. They need to change the dimensions in the description. Buyer beware!!"
5,"Great loaf dish, and pretty too!","Works just like it should. $5 is a great price, and it's attactive as well. Love cooking in glass rather than metal... so this was perfect."
5,Complete Satisfaction,"We purchased a power washer, but were disapointed when we discovered that it wasn't very powerful. We decided to purchase the dirtblaster spray wand. What an incredible difference it made. We live in a stone house that has stone paths with many years of dirt (and slime on the north side). The dirt blaster made it all look like new. Even our mailman commented on how great it looked."
4,Fantastic minimalistic tech,"This album is not for everyone. If you find things like Plastikman repetitive and dull then stay away. But if you do appreciate music that finds the perfect groove and envelopes you in it then you simply must check this out.Beautifully minimalist, haunting, and pure. Aptly named, The Cooler will leave you feeling cold after listening. If you want warm fuzzies, go elsewhere. If you want a razor-sharp knife slowly cutting ice cubes, buy this."
3,Someone must have regrets,"I wasn't as disappointed with the limited content of this book (10 songs) after I was made aware how hard it is to get music for Edith Piaf. But surely the popularity of ""Non, je ne regrette rein"" (sung by mice in the ""Pig in the City"" soundtrack) must be leaving its copyright holders (whoever they are) with regrets if the number of people chasing this song unsuccessfully is anything like what I'd suspect.The only other book of Piaf music we've found is ""Edith Piaf, album commemoratif"". More (twenty-two) songs and still no ""no regrets"" to be found.The book has the name of the chords but doesn't have the guitar chords as I would prefer.Tip: You'll find the Contents pages for many of the Hal Leonard titles sold here through their web site. If I had found this sooner, I would have saved myself a lot of guessing what songs were included.Now if I can only find the dots (music) by Bastille Day, we'll be set ... no regret."
3,Coleman Low Temp Cable,"I purchased this extension cable to feed to an electric snowblower. It works very well and maintains its flexibility in 0 degree weather. The voltage loss is well within what I expected and the power light in the end let me know when I had pulled the plug out of the socket. The tines are not as strong as I expected, but the bent back well. So it is important to secure the cable so that you don't put strain on the plug."
3,Heavy Cord,"This is fairly heavy and hard to manage - it tangles and curls into unwieldy shapes easily. I've strung it onto 2 reels to make it more manageable, and that's made my life easier. As heavy as this cord is, I've got to believe it's durable. Certainly electricity runs through it in cold weather. The 3 stars only reflects it's ""useability"" factor."
4,Good power cord. Bad shipping,A power cord is a power cord. Pretty simple. For the first time I had a bad shipping experience with Amazon. It came 2 days late because the package was damanged. Box was crushed. But since it's just a power cord everything was fine. Price is good compared to Lowe's or Home Depot. The savings comes into play with no shipping charge and no tax.
2,Sucks! Very poor quality.,My horse & I used to love these. It seems they have a new manufacturer that uses MUCH lower quality materials. Not only did mine fall apart in 10 days (and my horse is not hard on them) I found somebodyelse's in the trash at the ranch shortly after. I guess they thought even less of it than I did.
3,For the serious student of debtor-creditor law,Very technical work on Canadian fraudulent transfer law an insightful of how these issues are resolved by the Canadian courts.
3,"Yes, it's a sled...","It's your standard plastic sled, thick enough to be durable, thin enough to not be too heavy, good shape. Let's face it - this isn't rocket science. I needed a plastic tub, and the 26 inch width of this sled would work well enough for me (26 across the inside would be perfect). Well - it isn't 26 inches wide. If you pull on the sides you can stretch it out to 24 inches (about 22 inside) - but that's it.Come on people - either put actual dimensions or don't list them. So yes it's a sled, and I guess a decent sled - but I can't use it because it's not wide enough to fill the space I wanted. Oh - mine does have a seat (just kidding)."
4,A very solid debut,"I was pleasantly surprised by the tight sound on the Weather Machines' debut album. The vast majority of current indie music feels to me like pretentious, derivative cowtowing to post-punk and new wave icons. The Sound of Psuedoscience offers bright, anthemic tunes that are both informed by rock and roll heritage and orginal. ""Modern Text On Love"" is bound to be picked up by college radio sooner or later, but it is by no means the only gem found here. As for the modest rating and negative review offered by the Ohio curmudgeon, I doubt that the Weather Machines were trying to imitate the polished sound of Pharrell Williams or The Matrix. I am sure that the latest Hillary Duff album will offer him the high quality production values that he is seeking. The rest of us who like our rock and roll just a little raw will appreciate the Weather Machines and look forward to their next effort."
2,"Uneven, amateurish confusion","Sadly, not a compelling tune in the lot. Some songs are listenable, but still nothing much to write home about, or here, for that matter.I was disappointed, and hope they hire a professional recording engineer (and get a REAL producer, too) for their next effort. I might have better things to say, then."
3,decent quality,"Although overall the construction seems quite good for it's weight (it's pretty light.) I do have a complaint or two that others might want to note. The strap does not have any sort of shoulder pad at all, just a nylon strap, so if your laptop is of the heavy variety it may wear on your shoulder. Also, my dell 15.4"" fits snuggly, but so snuggly I can't leave any add-ons attached, specificlly it's kind of a pain to have to take out any PCM cards like my network card before storing the machine in the bag. I wish I knew those two things before buying, but it's still a decent bag."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS! VERY OLD SOFTWARE,"Notice the dates on the previous reviews. This product is purchasable, but is unsupported by Borland/Embarcadero. They didn't even develop it. Codewright corp did, and they sold their product to Borland as version 7.5. Needless to add -- Visual studio 2005 and later are not supported."
3,"soup has some spice in it,","this is a great cd, full of funk and soul and great players, itsgot some 'down to the bone' but not the same songs that sound thesame as dttb tho, each song is fresh and new and I liked thatabout it, the dvd is nothing to get excited about tho that camewith it, but 13 songs and theres not a bad one to hear, get it,"
5,Good value.,We use these cords for our engine block heaters on our semi-tractors. They are stored in the cabs year round and used exclusivly in cold weather. Like the fact that the cords do not get stiff in zero degree temps.
1,"sounds like heavy duty , BUT IS ONLY 16/3","I am a framer , sider , and do some additions and remodels. I bought this cord , thinking it would be a 12/3 but is only 16/3. Dont be fooled as I was . This a very poor deal for the money . Also , Only 40 degrees here in the rockies, (yes 9/23 2011) And it doesnt unwind , stays all kinked up . Good for -67 , I dont think so. Avoid this company and products if at all possiable. They are a scam in my opinion."
1,Warning! These are not waterproof,"I bought these to put on my bare feet after applying creme to soften dry skin and protect my bedding. The creme went right though this material. I had seen workers use these when they came in the house and thought they were to protect your floors from mud and snow. Reading the description now, I see that it says these protect from dust. I just didn't read carefully enough. Maybe I can find some other use for them."
4,Review,Great--was exactly what I was looking for. Arrived on time and has a nice dispensing area so you there is easy access to the product.
1,suck be thy name,what the hell is wrong with you people?!? this is not death metal!!!! Scream Jesus!!!!! AHHHH! This is the worst album I've ever heard! The worst!!! I will buy 20 copies of this just to break them! For shame!!!
5,Ahhhhh... Good ol' Extol,"Many claim this to be Extol's best release and I agree with that but also many think that their next two releases, Synergy and Blue Print Dives, suck. I totally disagree. Moving on. I've heard this called black metal but that is hardly true. Instead, this is progressive/technical death metal with a little doom and black metal mixed in. This was also my first Extol cd and is not only one of my favorite metal albums but also one of my favorite cds of any music genre. I love everything about this cd: the different vocals, the violins, cellos, and other musical instruments used, and the lyrics. I recommend this to those who love Opeth, Death, Atheist, Cynic, Pestilence, and this type of death metal and death metal period."
4,Heavy duty!,"I bought this to go inside a cabinet, but it was way bigger and heavier duty than I thought it would be. So, I promptly turned it over to my man, who is happily using it for more manly things.A very good, strong product. Just not as ""petite"" as I thought it would be. ;-)"
4,The other side of dark,"Recieved my order on time, has little wear but that is fine. Look forward to start reading my new book! Cheap price!!"
5,other side of dark by sarah b. for miss o,"The Other Side of Dark was a great mystery novel by Joan Lowery Nixon. It was a very suspenseful book and i never wanted to put it down, excited for what was coming next. Stacey wakes up at the age 17, to find she has changed very much since she awoke last. She was shot by the man who killed her mother and was put into a sort of coma for four years. The whole world is different from when she was shot at age 13. Now she has the mind set of a thirteen year old, in a 17 year old body. She finds that she can't trust anyone except for her own father and sister. Stacey is the only witness to her mother's murderer and hates that person very deeply. Will she ever remember the face???? I really wish Nixon would write a sequel to this book because it was so good."
2,THE OTHER SIDE OF DARK,I thought the end was very good. The middle was predictable and the begining was a little weird.
1,Worst Book Vixon's Ever Written,"I have to say, this is one of the worst books Joan Lowery Nixon has ever written. Ever. It focused far into the change in personal relationships which yes, would be important but no, are not the makings for any kind of thriller. The entire book was sadly predictable and the most boring read I've had in years.The ending was horribly rushed. I know at least five people under 14 who could've easily written this book and made it more interesting.I've repeatedly heard it called a page-turner, but the only reason I kept turning pages was because I hoped the next chapter might actually hook me, like many of Nixon's other books.I'm sure that for most, it would have been an excelent read, but I was hoping for something with suspence when I picked this book up off of the shelves."
2,Good plot but not written well.,"The other side of dark is about a 17 year old girl who had been in a coma since she was 13. She had been previously shot putting her in a coma. However her mom had been killed. She then awakes at the age of 17 where the story takes place. I admit this is a great plot line but i was not set up well. The murderer is way to obvious and is accused way early in the bookof being the killer. Not only that he didnt have a reason to kill her mom or shoot the main character seeing how he didnt even no them, making the book weird. And the ending was awful it ended with her saying it is fun being 17! (however i do recommend Nixon's other mystery books they are very well written and fun to read.)"
4,a good in-class novel,"This book, The other side of Dark was the best class novel we`ve read. The story is about a 17 year old, Stacey who has just woken up from being in a coma for 4 years. She is a 13 year old living in a 17 year old`s body. She was put in a coma when she was shot, shortly after she woke up she learned her mother was also shot, but she didn`t live. She remembers the killer, but can`t see their face. Her friends Jan and B.J. brought Stacey to parties with them to make her feel like she fit in with the rest of the 17 year olds. She meets Jeff at a party and after some time begins to like him. But there`s something about Jeff that is puzzling to Stacey. One night at a party Stacey meets another boy, Jarrod. He put alcohol in her drink, and when she realized it, she knew he was the killer. She has to find the evidence to prove to everyone she knows he is THE killer. To find out how things end up, read the book."
3,Not To Pleased,The ladder did not function well at all. One part broke as soon as our lab tried to come out of the water. Did not attach well at all. I had to sew and make straps with snap buckles to motifey the ladder to work as it should. I would not purchase one of this unless you are willy to make ajustments yourselve.
3,Nearly perfect.....,"We bought this ladder for our labrador-hound mix lady (55 lbs).After understanding how to mount and fix the ladder it worked very fine.Best if you can stand in the water for mounting - a little bit tricky if you can't stand or if you do it from inside the yacht.But it worked.The onyl criticism from my side: Because there are not all original parts of stainless steel there was rust on nearly any screw after the first use in salt water instead of rinsing the ladder each time with sweet water.So it will be necessary to replace all screws, nuts and washers by those made of stainless steel.Next year we will test the new configuration and hope that rust will be past.JoBu"
1,Don't Bother,"I bought this turkey at Fry's for $17 and have regretted ever since. The connection is faulty, the sound terrible the GUI unfriendly. I went to Frys originally to get a second Turtle Beach Audio Advanatge sound card but they didn't have it (not produced any longer, I think). I now have ordered from Amazon a Micro II Sound Card from Turtle Beach to replace this clunker. I hope it is as good as my original card (which is fantastic!)"
1,DON'T BUY THIS SOUNDCARD.,"This is the second USB soundcard I've purchased from SIIG for my laptop. Both of them have fallen apart after a couple of months use. The actual prongs holding in the USB connector literally fall out. I should've learned the first go around. Even though this product works, it sucks to have it fall apart so easily."
5,Knew it was Longyear by the title,"I love the ""Alien Nation"" characters, so sue me. I miss the show and find the books comforting. Unfortunately, the quality varies between authors; I approach each title with a janudiced eye.But when I saw ""Slag Like Me"", my first thoughts were, ""that sounds like Longyear"". And to our good fortune, it is. Barry's razor edged style is coated with poignancy. He's eloquent, articulate, and damned funny. Would that he could write more ""Alien Nation""s, but at least he's written this one. Get it, you won't be sorry."
4,Great set with one flaw,"Bought the 42PX75U Jan 2008 from reviews and comparing in store with many other brands. 15 months later the power unit failed which was replaced using the REX store warranty, even though they stopped selling electronics. No other problems 22 months later. Recently got an HD input and was shocked at the great picture quality. I don't think one would see a difference in this and a 1080 picture in this size. I'd buy this one again."
1,"Doesn't work at all, and not eligable for refund?","Single Player won't run, starts up for a second or two and then shuts down. Uninstalled, reinstalled, no luck with anything. 13 bones down the tube."
4,Easy Breezy Book Tour,"This is nice, easy reading for bibliophiles, as Hornsby does a monthly summary on which books he has bought and which he has read. His sense of humor is a delight, as is his sharp intelligence and critical prowess. A nice read for those who need to clear their palates between those challenging novels."
4,Ultra-low budget B Horror,"If you like low budget B horror flicks, this is a movie for you. Shot in a stark, almost documentary style and with realistic violence and gore, this slasher picture is reminiscent of indie 70's horror like the original TEXAS CHAN SAE MASSACRE and the original THE HILLS HAVE EYES. The beginning is kinda slow, but once you get to the killings, its a freakin' bloodbath."
5,Just fabulous,these were a gift for my boyfriend and let me say I am very impressed. These cufflinks look so good on. Everyone will notice them and love them
3,not as good as The Conspiracy for ps2.,The graphics are way better vs the conspiracy for ps2.. but the game play isn't there so much. I was bored most of the way through this game. It didn't have that much to draw me into the story. The biomods are kind of lame and aren't that big of a factor in gameplay. There's multiple endings which is cool. The framerate gets choppy quite a bit in areas and in places you wouldn't expect them to also.. A fan of the first but not the second in the deus ex series.
5,A terrific read. Riveting.,I've long been intrigued by the Grimaldis of Monaco and trying to seperate fact from fiction. Therefore I was delighted to read about a new book on the subject and expected the usual fluff and conjecture that passes for many biographies.After buying the Royal House of Monaco I sat down and found I could not put it down.Glatt's in-depth study of Monaco after the death of Princess Grace gives a new insight into the principality and made me see for the first time the immeasurable effect the American film star had.The book is written clearly and consisely and really gives the reader a picture of Rainier and his children that scrapes away the tabloid headlines. I would recommend this book for anyone interested in the real story of fairytale Monaco and Glatt must have hit a real nerve as I read that the Grimaldis unsuccessfully tried to stop its publication in the U.S.
1,this book does not provide any new information,This book is simply a paint by numbers look at the royal house of Grimaldis. It does not give any insight into what life in the palace is like for the royal family. It merely reads like a very long gossip column that has already been reported.
2,"Comme ci, comme ca","This is a very interesting book to read, what with the glitz and the glitter that the author presents.However, the historical accuracy is slipshod at best. There are a lot of lies published in this book that the author tries to pass off as true fact. He gets many dates and names mixed up as well.I'd like this book better if there was at least some research put into it."
5,Great Performers,I saw these two live at Jazz Fest and was amazed. Bill is an amazing guitarist and Kim's voice can be ethereal. Wonderful music.
4,Great Music,"I first got up on this duo on BET's bet on Jazz. Kim's vocals and Bill's playing are excellent, and their chemistry is flawless. I was a little disappointed with the rendition of ""Summertime"", but that's about my only complaint. I especially like their version of ""I'm Beginning to See the Light."" Great Stuff."
2,The cultural highlights of Great Britain in the 1700s.,"A trip through the British museum triggers Garfield to write this summary of the cultual highlights of Great Britain in the 18th Century. Garfield discusses how the common people (at least the 10,000 educated ones) become more prominent in society is such things as literature, art, and music. The prominet artists and authors are reviewed such as Gibbon, Hogarth, and Swift. Politicians such as Walpole also mentioned. The book was short, so it did a good job summarizing the cultural aspects of Britain in the 1700s at the start of the reign of the three Georges. A good review, but for more detail, read elsewhere."
5,DK Books are the Best.,"For those who travel and want the best books of their destination, DK Eyewitness books are the best source of information out there. With their glossy pages and colorful pictures, you actually see things you may have missed at the actual sight."
4,great product,"The only thing I could pick apart was, after shooting for a while it moved a little bit on the stock, nothing too bad though. Tight fit besides that and great quality."
1,Why bother?,"I am real sorry that Cohen felt the market needed another ""My Family Stinks"" book.I guess she wanted to be that greatest of people: the Published Author. Congratulations Susan."
4,Does what it says it does,"This is an excellent conditioner that helps keep my hair straight. The only downside being I don't care for the smell, but that's not a big deal because it is fine once my hair is dry."
1,Intuit stepped over the line,I found their little spyware jewel when trying to debug a touchpad delay problem that mysteriously appeared the day after installing TurboTax 2002. A support rep. suggested I un-install TurboTax to see if that was the problem. He manually guided me to disable the spyware (FOR WHICH THERE IS NO UN-INSTALL).I've used TurboTax for 6 years but never again. These guys did a very ugly thing.
1,BEWARE - Intuit installs SpyWare,"This is my first purchase of TurboTax and was very impressed by its ability to calculate my tax. However, I was rather upset and worried when I discovered that Intuit installs SpyWare on my machine. How could Intuit do this? Afterall it's a financial software with my private financial information. I'm going to switch to TaxCut next year."
1,Turbo Tax - Just say no to activation!!,"After using Turbo Tax in 2000 on my IMAC with Virtual PC,I bought Tax Cut for the MAC on CNETS recommendation in2001. Tax Cut was so buggy I switched back to TT.The activation software sabotages my windows emulatorand prevents the program from running. Installation wasflawless, but it won't run. PC requirements in TT adsdon't mention not running in PC emulators. I foundthat out after opening the box. No one should have to havesoftware activated. We already paid for it. Intuit refused tohonor the 60 day ""Unconditional Warranty"" so I filed a complaint with the Silicon Valley BBB for a refund. All we want is software that works and gives us no hastle. I hopea competitor that with stable software puts Intuit out of business."
2,A Disappointment,"Like so many others, I have been using Turbo Tax for serveral years. I think that it is time to move on to something else.When installing you need to activate your software so that you can use it. Before the installation is completed you are asked if you want to unlock Quicken...Once the program starts you are bombarded with upgrade offers for other Turbo Tax Products.This was the first year that I needed a form that was not included and so I had to update. That was a 30-40 minute process. Granted I live in the Stone Age and still use dial-up, but the Library of Congress will download quicker.This was one irritation after another. I'd rather shove slivers under my fingernails."
1,2002 Turbo Tax Stinks!!,Doesn't work worth a crap. This was the year that they had many problems and of which I was unaware before purchase.
2,TurboTax for the web,"TurboTax Deluxe is OK but there is a better altenative. Go to Intuit.com and file using TurboTax for the web - same version compatible with Windows and Mac. Also IRS Free File available at Intuit for federal and state returns with AGI of $27,000 or less. Note that TurboTax Free File is free for state (Maryland) as well as for federal returns. Others such as TaxCut are free for federal but charge as much as $19.95 for the state return."
2,Good product gone bad.,"If you don't agree with the new licensing scheme, then let customer support know by emailing 'support@intuit.com'. Let them know how you feel and what you'd like to see changed. Maybe they'll listen and change the product installation and licensing process. Vote with your pocketbooks, as they say. Maybe Intuit will listen, if enough people complain, and change their evil ways.Otherwise, I think the product is good. I've been an end-user since 1993. However, with the above problems I now only give it 2 stars, instead of 4."
1,Dedicated turbo tax customer - no longer,For many years I have used TurboTax to prepare and file my tax returns and until now have been pleased with their software. However with their new license restrictions I have decided to switch products. I bought a new computer and tried to tranfer my data only to find it would not print. In the online tech support area I learned they installed some sort of product license tracking. I get enough of a headache doing taxes I don't want a bigger one dealing with licensing just to get the software to work. I returned the product to Cotco got my money back. Intuit lost me as a customer.
1,Not buying this next year,"Turbo tax is a disaster this year.I spent one hour with product activation. The product activation codeon the box did not work. I had to go online and get a new activation codethat took a while to figure out.The rebate process is a nightmare! I still havn't gotten my rebate. You haveto cut out little bits of the box, fill in forms, make copies in case they screw upthe rebate and you have to show proof etc -- all designed to make you giveup. This is well known sales strategy - a small percentage of people actuallymail in rebates. So I guess if you make it frustratingly hard - no one willmail it in. Bad business practice.I'm going to look out for some other tax software next year."
1,Be afraid of Activation,"I'm not a fair use or privacy nut.But the new TurboTax product is unacceptable, and will not go on my computer. The product uses C-Dilla SafeCast product activation. This ""add-in"" will install an additional program on your hard drive THAT RUNS ALL THE TIME UTILIZING SYSTEM RESOURCES. The only way to remove C-Dilla is to uninstall the program -- meaning you can't use it. There are extensive reports online about the permanent information the program leaves on your hard drive that will survive even a reformatting."
1,"We know what it is, here is what to do with it.....","If you bought it you'r ""stuck with it"". Inscrewit does not give refunds. Soooo, do the next best thing. Ship it to someone you hate!!"
1,Installation Problems and Errors,I've been using TurboTax for over ten years....this year is my last. Too many problems trying to install a ... program. I have a 3 year old Windows98 machine. It kept locking up due to memory overrun and would not let me install it on another computer without calling Intuit and waiting for tech support. I switched to Tax Cut and my computer and I am very happy.
1,Just switched to TaxCut,I have used TurboTax for the past 3 years but have just switched to TaxCut because of TurboTax's activation scheme. Actually I have to thank Intuit - TaxCut seems just as good as TurboTax and it's cheaper.
1,NO REBATES on TurboTax Deluxe,"The software worked, though it's a bit awkward, but the rebates never happened, for the state downloads or electronic filing. I filled out all the forms, sent them in on time, did the whole nine yards, never got a penny back. Most rebates eventually happen, with TurboTax NEVER."
1,TurboTax Quality Hits Rock Bottom,"I have been a loyal TurboTax customer for 5 years, but after this year's experience, I will never buy it again! Not only did I experience activation problems, but I found several bugs in the State program. Contacting Technical Support was a joke. They want $ to talk to a real person or you can use their free online chat. They actually told me to boot my machine in safe mode in order to get the software to activate properly. I made a web page on geocities.com/turbojunk2002 with the full account of my experience, including the dialog from the chat sessions. It's worth checking out if you want a good laugh (at my expense). Do your self a favor this year and DO NOT BUY TURBOTAX!"
2,Back to the Eighties,TurboTax 2002 prevents you from using the program on more than one computer. You can install it on a second PC but you cannot print a return on it. What a cheap shot!
1,Avoid TuboTax like the PLAGUE!!!,"I first tried the promo CD sent in the mail, then purchased another copy from the store. Both gave me the ""Product Activation Error - "".Technical Support...NOT! Their online representatives give you canned scripts with no real solutions. Telephone support is a maze of recorded messages. They want you to spend an additional $... per issue for telephone support, plus long-distance charges.After spending 6 days trying to get this software to work and refusing to pay the additional $...for support, I finally got a Technical Support Representative on the line to tell me...""WE DON'T HAVE A FIX FOR THAT RIGHT NOW...CHECK BACK IN A WEEK.""Good bye TurboTax...Hello TaxCut!!!"
1,TurboTax is TurboScrap,Never will I purchase this product again. Their activation code allows the program to be installed on 1 pc only! Goodbye Intuit!
1,I would like to give it 0 stars.,I would like to join the host of others who have given TurboTax the lowest possible rating. I would give it 0 stars if that were a choice. I made the mistake of buying TurboTax with no advance warning whatsoever of the new security measures that this year's version would have. I'm even more upset that the program also installs the so-called C_Dilla [program] that requires all but a low level reformatting of the hard drive to get rid of it. Just shame on you Intuit!
1,This software does work on my computer!,"I purchased this software and planned to file taxes this weekend but still could not activate it. I spent almost all day trying to figure out what is the problem. It looks like that if any additional devices or peripherals are installed on you computer it would not be possible to activate this software. However, all other software packages installed on my computer work without any problems."
1,BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE,"I was going to use TAX CUT this year but, they had just put it on the shelves and didn't lower the price yet so I chose TurboTax for the sixth year in a row. When my computer hard disk had errors, I upgraded. It took me over 20 minutes of online help with intuit to reactivate the software, they kept asking circular questions. Based on this customer service I will not use the software next year."
1,Activation Problems,"The activation feature caused nothing but problems when installing it on the new computer we got for Christmas. Intuit phone support was of no help. I'm switching next year if they don't remove this damn activation. Also, it's not clear that the product is additionally crippled by requiring separate purchase of TurboTax state (even if there is a rebate for it)."
1,No more TurboTax this year for me!,"I have used TurboTax since 1993. During that time, I would have rated it with 3 1/2 to 4 stars. Now with this activation nonsense, I will rate it at 1 star.The reason: Several times over the past 9 years, I have needed to re-install the product for a previous tax year and then import my related saved tax data file. With this new activation process, I would have to contact Intuit! That is a bad experience.If you have ever attempted to contact Intuit's support, you'll agree that they have the longest hold times - coupled with probably the worst support in the software industry... and they charge you $$ for that entitlement!So, for me, I'm going to pass on TurboTax this year. Perhaps next year, Intuit will acknowledge their mistake by withdrawing this activation requirement."
1,There was no choice to give out -0- stars!,"If you've ever been under review by the friendly folks at the IRS, you'd better make sure that you can access any number of prior year's data.This new version of TT will hinder you at every corner.Do you think the IRS will let you use this as an excuse?Think again before buying this program!"
1,Intuit does not respect it's own customers...,"I have used TurboTax several times over the past few years, but I won't be using it this year. Aside from the notorious problems with Intuit's ""anti-piracy"" feature, really lousy customer service, and updtae difficulties, here is a problem most users don't even know about. Intuit apparently sells your contact info to everyone under the sun, because you'll get a flood of junkmail and spam after registering. The company makes it very challenging to opt-out, and they absolutely FLOOD you with their own junkmail..."
1,No more TurboTax for me,"Too bad the lowest rating you can put is still 1 star; this product deserves 0 star. I have been using TurboTax for last few years, and this will be my last year. The activation process is a joke."
1,Avoid this software like the plague,It installs a copy protection system service that runs AT ALL TIMES and consumes your system resources. It creates a hidden directory at the root of your drive for this copy protection software. If you buy a new PC you have to beg for new activation code to reinstall it. Dont support Intuit's attempt at restrictive licensing that penalizes their legal customers!
1,Too intrusive to install... returning my copy to the store,"From all the reviews and technical analysis of this product, I am sad to say I will be returning my copy. I've been an avid user of TurboTax for the past 6 years having purchased each and every copy I've used. I do not appreciate the fact that this software actually writes to the boot sector of my hard drive and makes it so difficult to re-install.I have no choice but to pick up TaxCut to do this year's return and PRAY everything from my last year's TurboTax transfers over correctly. If the maker of TaxCut are smart, they will find some way to exploit this influx of new customers.This is a HUGE marketing blunder for Intuit! I am re-evaluating all my future purchases from this company in the future."
1,do not touch any turbotax program,"You can activate turbotax only once. If it ever fails, in my case via feeding it a bad file, your program AND the tax data you entered recently is dead, DEAD, DEAD!Half a day's phone chase (for which I have no time!), got the program reactivated via an Intuit rep in Phoenix. I will NEVER buy turbotax again.Taxact, not as convenient, has no such problems. have similar copy protection next year, does not have it yet."
1,Product Activation was poorly implemented,Although I understand Intuits desire to protect their software I believe that putting a program permanently in memory is too much. Even after uninstalling TurboTax the C-Dilla stays behind consuming resources.Next year they claim that they are going with a less intrusive product activation. I've used TurboTax for years and am so disappointed in this version that I will be purchasing TaxCut next year. It doesn't matter what Intuit does next year. Witholding money is they only way software companies will understand how serious the consumers are about this.If you like TurboTax then try TaxCut next year. You'll be doing yourself and Intuit a favor.
1,Slippery Slope,"I don't care if Intuit wants me to activate their software. It's a hassle but, in the end, it's a nit.Nor do I care about being stopped every 5 minutes during TurboTax's interview process so Intuit can try to sell me just one more tiny add-on/product/service,... It's annoying but, in the end, it's the American way.What I DO care about is this SafeCast / C-Dilla garbage. Not only does it install without notice, it installs surreptitiously by installing into a hidden folder. Then, it runs as a system process which is automatically launched at start up independently of TurboTax. And it's not uninstalled when TurboTax is uninstalled.The process uses ""only"" 1 MB of RAM. That's not much, of course, until EVERY software vendor in the world decides to follow suit by using ""their own"" 1 MB of MY RAM. And when they do it without my knowledge or permission,...?I've removed all Intuit software from my computer."
1,Loyal customer no more,"I have used TurboTax for years and have gone through several computers, so all versions may be asked to print someplace they didn't start out at. To blindside loyal customers with another way to make a dollar, Intuit is making a bad mistake. They may be using the same activation criteria as WindowsXP and OfficeXP, but I can live without TurboTax.From now on, I plan to go to Tax-cut.Shame on you INTUIT!!"
1,Lack of assistance & hidden expense,"Problem with all Intuit products is that their support is both inert and inept. They also fail to tell you that the files necessary to make the ""product"" complete [such as additional states] must be bought from Inuit and is expensive."
1,"It may be your software, but it's my PC","The ironic twist in all of this is that somebody will undoubtedly crack the activation scheme. So the warez monkeys will still steal it, but legitimate users, who shell out hard earned cash for it, get digitally violated (without even a kiss first).You obviously don't think much of me as a customer, so now I no longer think of you ... at all."
1,No more Turbotax,"Bought Turbo Tax 3rd year in row and installed it. Installed fine with no problems. Several days later I tried to back up my data files to a CDRW, like I do every week, and the drive would just lock up. At the time I didn't think of Turbo Tax being the problem. I ended up buying a new drive and had the same problem. That's when I came across a web site talking about the C-dilla copy protection used on Turbo Tax. I uninstalled Turbo Tax, and then used the Macrovision SafeCast (C-Dilla) components uninstall program from Intuit's web site. You have to do this since simply uninstalling the Turbo Tax program DOES NOT remove the protection it had originally installed. As soon as I did this, my CDRW worked fine. Same with the old one. Intuit, where do I send a bill for the time and money I wasted because of your software?"
5,My Taxes Are Done,"Thanks to Intuit and it's quick and easy to use product, I am done my taxes with minimal effort. I had no problems installing it or using it on multiple machines. It's as user friendly as ever. I don't understand what everyone is complaining about."
1,The demise of TurboTax,"Okay, I think this is one nail in the coffin of TurboTax's death. Not only are there many other competitors offering a web version for a lot less, but they also include e-filing for free.I installed it on my computer at home and then on my laptop, hoping to do my taxes on the road. Needless to say, I gave up, threw the thing away and swore never to buy this product again! And incidentally, you spys at TurboTax, I don't condone piracy. If anyone is the pirate, its them. Installing spyware on your machine and disguising it as a licensing mechanism. Macrovision are also the same crooks who (besides making this spyware), have their chips on DVD players that help region blocking."
5,honest opinion,"If you need to work on a second machine, just copy your data on to disk and update the original machine--it's not a big deal!!"
1,Took it back,"I bought TT, but returned it after reading the reviews. I bought Tax Cut and it worked great."
1,ouch - had to reinstall windows,"wow - stay away - i had to reinstall windows after this c-dilla program was on my pc. not worth it, and taxcut is much better"
1,I switched this year,"Last year I bought two copies of this program. One for myself and one for my mother. Intuit sent me my rebate check from their ""special offer"", but mom never got a check from them. Presumably this is because I paid for both copies.This year I'm buying two copies of Taxcut instead."
1,"Bad Idea, Intuit","I switched from Quicken 2000 to Money 2003 beginning this year; I did buy TT 2002 Deluxe at Costco for $... bucks less a ...rebate, so I got it cheap. I d/l the state and got it free. I've used Quicken and Turbo Tax software for the last 5 years; no more. I probably won't change computers, so I don't have that problem, rather it's just the idea of it. Apparently Intuit doesn't trust us. If there were not competing software such as H&R; Block's Tax Cut (I think it was Kiplinger's a few years ago), I would probably do it by hand. I think Intuit has entered the Microsoft mindset (We own the world, they've got to buy from us). Well, as the baby says:I DON'T THINK SO, BALDY!As someone said earlier, there's got to be a better way to protect piracy than that. SheeshPat"
1,Activation Problems,"I was a long time TT customer, but no more. Couldn't get the 2002 software to activate, even though I had purchased (not borrowed) it. Not just once but twice, because the first time customer support told me that I must have a ""bad"" disk. Eventually I was told that I couldn't activate because my computer was connected to a home network. Please! Intuit does this to try to prevent people from stealing $30 software? All they really succeeded in doing is losing a paying customer! My advice - go check out the competitor's products."
1,Unbelievably BAD!! AVOID AVOID AVOID!!,"I have just spent over 7 hours on a chat session trying to get help installing Turbo Tax Premier Version. Intuit was not only uncooperative but did not help in any way. Their lack of an 800 Help Line is particulary irriating, but their ... charge for a phone call is just robbery. I am going to tell everyone I meet about Intuit's deplorable service and help. DO NOT BUY!! AVOID,AVOID,AVOID"
1,Intuit lost a 7 year customer,"Horrible. Ads pop up while you are doing your taxes! I paid for this program and it's going to bother me with advertising?! C-dilla has potentially serious privacy concerns as well. I have used turbotax each year for the past 7 years, but this is the end for me. Good bye Intuit."
2,Not persuasive,"By reading the prologue I assumed the author was going to ease a reader's concerns about ""FrankenFoods."" Instead, it turned into a history book, detailing how our first bio-engineered foods and species came about. It did not address some of the questions I had hoped an advocate for today's technology would challenge: about commodifying seeds used the world over, and forcing people to use them by removing those that are unpatented; about allergies and the need for labeling. In short, I thought it avoided the issues I hoped to consider."
4,"Good, but could be better","Though I enjoy Jennifer Roberson's Cheysuli Cycle very much, that book was for me a little bit disappointing. There were too many characters instead of one, who'd be better characterised. And the plot was quite similar to these in previous books in the cycle. But, in spite of all, it remains worth reading."
2,Vocab specific to publishers,"I rated the first three Pimsleur cd's very highly. This one however seems to have been done for their own employees as its almost solely about publishing. So if you are a publisher then the new vocabulary will be helpful, otherwise I don't think you will find the new vocabulary particularly useful."
5,Review of Sokolow's guide,"Author Sokolow's guide provided excellent resources for our college-bound child. Not only was the guide thoughtful and well-written, but it inspires the reader as well. The information will make the planning and application process much more effective. Thank you, Ms. Sokolow!"
2,color issues,I was very disappointed in the color of the cream and sugar - it was portrayed as turquoise on line but was very green. I compared it to the color on line and it was not even close.I sent it back - an expensive and bad experience. Same goes for the dishes.
2,What a disappointment!,"I pre-ordered a copy of Black Metal Veins as I was so entirely impressed with the previous (far better) Vomit Gore Trilogy. But BMV is a huge disappointment. We get 90 plotless minutes of watching extremely unattractive addicts sit around b*tching, nodding off together and having rather boring sex with each other. Even the scenes that are supposed to be ~shocking!~ drag and appear staged as all hell. Also, where the hell is the black metal? Long story short, BMV disappointed me in every way I can think of. And that's a huge shame coming from a director who has the talent to make much, much better films than this."
1,Sophmoric program older than its release date would suggest.,"I was famfoozled by all the positive reviews and my own natural prediliction for British mysteries. This was a real disappointment -- so childish and stupid in its ""jokes"" and I don't find either main character likeable OR dislikeable in a way that amuses, so thumbs down on this one for me. (And I really like Toby Stephens in most everything else that he does)."
2,Around the world in 80 days,Very poor transfer to cd. It sounds like a bootleg copy.The sound is monaural and does not have anything like the brilliance that it should have. Prospective buyers shhould make sure they are buying the stereo version which is also available at a little extra cost
5,Suprisingly Funny!,"This book is very easy to read. I finished it in two afternoons.I can't remember the last book I read that made me laugh so hard. This is really, really funny! Regardless of your denomination or doctrine, I think anyone would really enjoy this book."
1,Does not work for me. Save your money!,"This shampoo does not work for me at all. I used as instructed and even expected the worse (which it did says up to 6 months to see results). I don't see any results after 6 months, so keep trying to give it a 12 months (1 year). Not only I did not see any results, my hair is slowly thinning out instead. I am beginning to wonder if this shampoo is actually for thinning out your hair instead of helping to regrow them. All I know is I am done with this product, wasted my money for something that actually made it worse for me. This is the 1st time I ever review a product at Amazon, only reason I write it is because is so ineffective that I have to put it out there to let others know it is not worth your money."
4,Good video!,This really works your core. Moves a little fast but still a good workout! I would recommend this video to younger women.
2,"Listen to their older stuff, this is fluff","Enigk's art has no depth to it at all anymore....starts off alright, but just fades into mediocrity quickly"
2,the worst SDRE album.,"this the worst album by sunny day real estate. now, i am a HUGE fan of SDRE, but this album is total crap. hell, the fire theft album is better than this heap of poop.there are a few good songs, but i am not going to tell you what they are, so you can just go to kazaa and download them. no, no, no. i want you to buy this terrible cd, with the high hopes of it being another 'diary', or 'LP2', or hell, even '...something on', and be just as friggin' disappointed with this music as i was.terrible, absoulutely terrible.(--dp--)"
1,What a waste of money!,"Why would anyone want to pay twenty more dollars for a CD than they would normally pay only to get an acoustic version of the worst song on it? I have no idea. If you like Sunny Day Real Estate, then you should get The Rising Tide, just not this rip-off version of it!"
5,SDRE is winning me over,Just bought The Rising Tide a few minutes ago. Reminds me a bit of How It Feels To Be Something On. I liked that album; more than I liked their freshman and sophomore releases. I'm impressed with what they're doing now. Lyrics are typical SDRE- a bit on the cryptic side. But the music is good and Jeremy Enigk's voice sounds as lush and beautiful as ever. Nice work!
5,A Magical collection!,"Eric Carle's gorgeous watercolor collage images are a perfect companion to the mythical poems in this book. Poetry from classic writers such as E.B. Browning, Sato, and Shakespeare comes together with more contemporary work from X.J. Kennedy, Arnold Sundgaard, and others. These are great for reading aloud, though very young children might find the pictures and words just a bit creepy!"
1,Disappointing & Offensive...,"Unfortunately I had never seen this book in person and so that part about ""& other creatures that never were"" turned out to be disappointing and offensive. I ended up taping the pages together. Not only were some of the pictures way too scary, it categorized Leviathan as a myth... and worse yet, it quoted the Bible - alluding to the idea that the Bible itself is a myth. Historically I'm a huge Eric Carle fan... so I'm saddened by the fact that I can no longer assume his work is something ""safe"" or ""appropriate."""
5,Fantastic film,Every American should watch this film. The director had access to both the Americans and a Sunni physician and the contrast and story were compelling and touching naratives of the first election in Iraq.
3,Previous experience better than this one,"I have used this effectively for effects setups in the past, but this particular batch has been lass than pleasant. Every cable I have made has required 2 or 3 tries and cuts to get a working connection, and the straight plug opening is almost too narrow for the cable (have only made one with a straight plug that works). I have had to send for more cable which is REALLY hard to find without buying the whole kit."
1,Abject nonsense on a stick,"The way you flood your body with oxygen is to breathe. The amount of excess oxygen in foods, hydrogen peroxide and the like is negligible by comparison, and even if it weren't, the body has no mechanism for oxygenation from the digestive tract."
2,Great Book,I have enjoyed this book greatly. It has given me a better insight to flooding my body with more oxygen.
5,Sounds good,I have not had the time to read any of this but I am sure to find lots of information concerning another form of good health.
5,Great. Just what I was looking for.,I bought an Ozenator for the home and I needed to know more on what it was doing. This book was very helpful in that are.Great book. A Lot of information which is great.
2,Extremely big,Maybe its not a problem about the product but anyway its extremely big for my GE x500. now i dont know what to do with this horrible huge thing.
3,Beware Descriptions!,"I purchased this case because the price was right and I was looking for a smaller holster case. I have a Tamrac 517 and it is a little large when I'm using a 28-70mm or 24-80mm lens. I checked the dimensions twice and felt this would be a good deal and a perfect fit for my Canon 10D and A2E. Of the five cameras I own and use it only fits two, Canon FT QL and AE1-P. Unfortunately I don't use the FT much and I use the AE1-P with a Power winder and so it doesn't fit when it's attached. I store extra lenses and angle finders in the Opteka and attach it to my gadget bag most of the time.Enough with the negative though. Upon examination, it seems to be a well made case (for the price). When I have used it for the AE1-P it works well and its compact size make it easy to attach to my belt and still move around with ease.If you have the correct camera this bag is worth the money and a great deal."
5,Perfect for my SLR and a Great Value,"The Optica Camera Short Zoom Holster case is the perfect case to keep your SLR safe while on the go.I purchased this case to protect my Konica FT-1 when I don't want to carry my large camera bag with all of my equipment.I find my FT-1 fits perfectly in the holster when I have a 35-70mm lens fitted to it. There is just enough room for the camera & lens, with small pockets to hold a lens cap and perhaps a cleaning cloth.This is not a bag to store extra film or a flash unit in, but it is a fine quality holster case, and a great bargain.I would certainly buy another."
1,Cheap Zipper,This bag broke within a week of when I purchased it because the zipper split.It did however perfectly fit my Canon Rebel 2Ti with its EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS Lens.
2,Cheap and Clunky,"Really, I should have known. But, as you can clearly see, this bag gets a lot of respectable reviews. However, the zipper on my case, while it looks normal, is a pain to open and close. In the picture, you can see that the zipper needs to come around two contours. Probably some of them do just fine, but not mine. Now, if you're looking for a small bag, you want it to open on command. I expect this zipper to snag to the point of damage within 10-15 uses (think high school back pack on sale + 4 textbooks). I will now be buying a higher priced bag."
5,Great case!,"When I bought my Canon Digital Rebel XT, I tried out the Canon case for it, but was disgusted with it, calling it a ""black hole"" in my review. This case, however, works great. It fits the Rebel with the standard lens and strap, and is quite easy to use. I can get the camera in and out within ten seconds. It works either on a belt, over your shoulder, or in your hand. This is a great case!"
2,Small,"Too small !! not even an inch left literally !! Spare battery, Lens cap etc have no space ! unbelievable ! A total waste, now I am searching for a slightly larger one to keep the charger etc etc."
1,Cheaply Made Bag. Not Worth Getting.,"It does not make sense to buy a cheaply made bag for an expensive SLR. Especially when lenses and cameras can go in the thousands dollars and you choose to protect it with a crappy bag. It is the same thing as having a Ferrari and filling it with 87 octane fuel from Arco.I had this bag for my Canon XTi and have regretted the purchase. While running across the street with this bag on my shoulder, the shoulder strap broke and the camera fell to the street. Luckily the fall wasn't enough to damage the camera, but if it happened again, I'm sure it could have caused some damage.Cough up the extra dough for a better camera bag like theLowepro Fastpack 100 (Black)or any from Lowepro. I would not buy a generic bag like Opteka ever again."
4,Good value for money,Good value for money. Fits camera like a glove (Cannon T3i). Would recommend to a friend and would buy again.
4,Good for my Canon T3,was looking for an alternative case/bag apart from the one i already have so i don't look like a complete tourist when out and about. great for it's price but it's a little hard to get the camera in and out
2,The Sweet price is it's best aspect. The only admirable one.,"Started off as a good cheap option for my Nikon D40 with the 18-55mm lens.However, the zippers (2) went bad in the next few months. I wouldn't say I am the most gentle of handlers but they did not last me. Right now I am having to make do with this but I hope it aren't long before I scale up to a better (quality), more comfortable (shoulder strap) & more durable/ tough (zippers and overall) case in the near future. It is worth a 2.5 star I would think.Even if you are on a low budget keep this in mind before you jump onto this one.Cheers!"
3,A tight fit for D40.. forget using the bigger cameras,"I bought this one for my canon rebel XS but there is no way you would want to use it for that. It just about fits my D40 and it a real pain to get it in and out of the bag, even more so if you have the neck strap on the camera. I wouldnt recommend it, but if you are on a tight budget and can manage the compromises, then try it..."
2,Zipper fail,"The zipper on this product messed up after less than a month. This case fits the Canon XSi with kit lens pretty snugly. However, I do not like how it hugged (or did not hug, rather) the camera. If you have the Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4.0-5.6 IS Telephoto Zoom Lens attached to your XSi, it will not fit. Also, I'm a little embarrassed to carry this case around, because unlike the pictures online, in real life it looks like the seat of a bicycle.... so it looks like I'm carrying a bicycle seat (or as my sister likes to say -- that crotch piece) around."
2,needs a better zipper,The bag would be awesome if it wasn't made with the cheapest zipper possible. From day one it can't manage to close the bag properly.
5,Tasteful and convenient for keeping the camera with me all the time,"I hate how ugly most camera cases out there are. This one is much more tasteful looking, and is small enough that I can just throw it over my shoulder whenever I'm going out, and never miss a good opportunity to take some pictures. Fits the T2i beautifully with the kit lens, and has some extra space so longer lenses (within reason, of course) could fit as well. Overall, a solid buy."
4,fun to give and receive,"it's not a lot of food for the money, but you're not really buying the food so much as the fun of it. my mom and dad are pretty traditional so they at least tried each box, but they prefer the cheap stuff. they did enjoy having individual boxes to open and new stuff to try so it was still worth it for me."
2,"""Not at all what I expected"" he said sadly",I have read several books and own other documentary style DVD's from the Disinformation brand and been very pleased. This DVD however was a real disappointment. I have a bizare sense of humor but too many segments of this DVD focused on pornography or other aspects of erotica. Not my thing. The remainder of the nut-jobs were interesting and sometimes funny. Brother Theodore was hysterical. I wish however that I hadn't bought this DVD (even though t was only $1) and will likely dump it at my local used DVD and CD store for 50 cents.
1,Schizophrenics Say The Darnedest Things,"This show starts out with the pretentious claim that they will reveal the truth that giant corporations don't want you to know. In reality, its largely interviews with schizophrenics and bad performance artists.Maybe rent, but definately don't buy. The only nuggets I found were an interview with Grant Morison, a somewhat amusing group that does theater to surveillance cameras, and the stop-action robot sex animations. The rest is garbage, and the use of mentally ill people as freak-show entertainment is not exactly high-minded television."
1,Many problems.,"I purchased this player from Costco at a great price. I was excited to try it out with my new HDMI LCD HDTV.Unfortunatly, DVD playback freezes and skips occasionally, and it is not a disk problem -- even brand new DVDs don't play correctly.The resolution upconversion also seems to have problems. Video quality is fuzzy when a DVD is upconverted to 1080i. Honestly, it looks best when the DVD player outputs 480p, and the upconversion is done by the TV.Then, after 3 days of use, the unit froze and locked a DVD inside. All buttons were useless and it wouldn't even power down. Everything seemed to 'reset' after being unplugged for a few minutes.I had two reasons for buying this DVD player: play DVDs and upconvert video. Since it cannot do either, I will be returning it."
4,so cute!,"This is a cute set, the towl and washcloth are holding up well but are a bit thin. Overall a great value for our little surfer :)"
4,Biased,"This tome presents an excellent view of Castro's past, his interests, and insights into a man I have admired throughout the years. Szurek, probably by agreement, left out some harsh practices the Castro government performed. Unfortunately, it is not a ""Critical Portrait"", but historically it is an excellent read if you don't mind ignoring what's been left out."
5,Pop-Ups,"Recently I have become extremely interested in Pop-Ups, but being engineering challenged I have had to do a deal of research. I have obtained several books and found them mildly useful, but my best learning has been from studying actual pop-up books themselves. That is until this amazing book came along! It is without doubt the very best book for klutzes like me. It is clear and straightforward. Each technique is explained in a section and then the last page of the section can be cut out and you are able to construct the technique that has been explicated. You then glue the construction you have made into the book for future reference. I cannot recommend this well-designed book too highly."
2,"Artsy-Craftsy, not just Artsy","The book contains templates from which one is able to base designs, which is nice, however most of the designs were not exactly what I was wanting. Everything is kind of basic and ""craftsy"", whereas I was searching for something more art-oriented, more detailed and creative. Thankfully, I bought this with another, which exceeded all my expectations. The title of that book is The Pop-Up Book: Step-by-Step Instructions for Creating over 100 Original Paper Projects."
2,"Great Content, Terrible Video Quality","I saw this program on Mojo and thought it was great that I could buy a copy on DVD. It probably has the worst video quality of any DVD I have ever seen, which is especially surprising considering it was aired as an HD program. The video is 4:3 format with letterboxing so that the picture is a small rectangle in the middle of a widescreen TV. There are also very significant compression artifacts."
3,Need color choice opportunity,"The product structure is great, but I bought it on the basis of the green image. The two that arrived were royal blue and pink. Pink is just not what my 6th-grade son wanted!"
2,very small,It stays very securely to my locker. It holds a considerable amount of weight. But I never checked the dimensions---and it is way smaller then I thought.
4,Useful book for beginners learning to maintain their bikes,"Hugo Wilson has put together the essentials for learning to maintain a UJM (Universal Japanese Motorcycle;) though many of his techniques apply to many or even most bikes, his examples are all Japanese models, such as Yamaha, Honda & Suzuki.This small book has many attractive, full-color photos, showing exactly the bits in question, and the tools used to fix them. There are also areas which explain the basics of how items like spring/damper suspension units work, which many people new to the inner workings of motorcycles will surely find interesting.Wilson's text is easy-to-follow, and informative. The book may contain some information that well-acquainted riders don't know, but is, I believe, most useful for those who are relatively new to maintaining their bikes."
3,A quick overview - fairly basic.,"It is not that this book is really bad in anyway, but it is very basic and only skims the surface. A nice little introduction, but if someone is really going to do maintenance on their cycle, they need a book specific to that bike."
3,Yoga for Grandparents,A lot of yoga exercises were for couples. We couldn't use those. Otherwise very good.
2,Not enough practical information,The chapter titles sound very interesting but the contents do not provide enough practical information.
1,A very poorly written book,I tried using this book to find out a specific item of information and it contained no examples on something that is a basic part of building web pages. Finally found the answer (and even with a good explanation!) in a dummies book. This book is only good to feed a fire!
5,Happiness and Other Lies,"This book was a delight. Unlike other books on the subject, it takes a realistic and hilarious look at happiness, particularly the myths surrounding it. Massaro writes with piercing honesty and insight as she dissects the fallacies of the American Dream. Her candor is refreshing and her wit is captivating. I strongly recommend the book to anyone looking for the truth."
3,Very overrated,"I don't see what there is to love about this film unless it reminds you of feelings you got from other films or experiences. The only stories worth telling were when the woman and boy were killed off. The armwaving at the end was just a nod to political correctness, I guess.The song lyrics were particularly bland, and the musical interludes seemed to be trying to sell you on thinking this was an opera.To me, this was just barely a three. And yes, I have spent a month wandering alone on foot in the mountains in the snow, but that didn't make me like this film.The only real saving grace was the wilderness."
1,Wrong Region,I was unable to watch the DVD because the seller didn't mention the region. I live in the USA. He advertised on the US site and sent a UK version.
1,not exciting,It has been a long time since I've seen this movie but it was so-o-o-o boring. It just went on and on and on. I didn't think it would ever quit. Several times it the movie it seemed it was suppose to end but it just went on. I don't ever want to see or hear of this movie again.
4,Jeremiah Johnson,A Classic western. Robert Redford is believable and gives a great performance. A serious movie and one that gives some insight to the hard western life and the beliefs of the American Indian.
5,best movie,"This is the best movie ever made, hope I don't wear it out with all the watching I have done and will do"
2,Jeremiah Johnson,I opened the case and it looks like the DVD is a copy. I'm not pleased with that.I've not watched the movie yet and may return it.
3,Epic movie,"John Milius script so it's plenty fortified with testosterone, buy nothing else. Great scenic outdoor cinematography. The story could be condensed for an hour long television show,"
3,This was a gift,"I don't know how to rate this product because I have not seen it, but my mother is a big fan of this film, and it was a gift I sent her for her upcoming birthday"
5,Time & Tide was the best album,I remember when my Mom had got this album back in the early 90's. I thought she had an amazing voice when I heard her song Promises. I not sure what happened to the album because I haven't seen it in 5 years since I moved. I did enjoy Basia's song New Day For You although I hear it on the radio at work sometimes. Since I liked the album I decided to buy Time & Tide again because it brought me some memories from listening to it back in 1994. I can't wait to get it in the mail.
5,"After 17 years, it's still one of my favorite albums ever...","...and I'm talking top 3 from a 42 year old who's been into music since the age of 3. I have purchased this album many times over, on vinyl, cassette, and CD, to give away as gifts. I don't know how to describe this one, except to quote a review I remember from People magazine in 1987: ""the definition of cool."" It's cool, in an oh so hot way. The cool of jazz, the fiery passion of brazilians stylings, from this skinny little Polish lass with the biiig voice. I've yet to encounter an album that touches me like this one."
1,The dumbest waste of time movie ever made.,"This movie is by far the worst movie I have ever seen.To rent it would be to waste money, time,and effort to carry it . Do not rent buy or think about this movie ever.It attempts to be stunning and amazing by showing this ugly uneducated group of hicks from xenia ohio, but it does nothing but stun you in that someone would actually film this.MISTAKE!"
1,just not good,"I rented this movie because it seemed like it had potential. I've seen a lot of movies that are weird and/or very disturbing, and this is definitely no exception. However, this movie was just, to put it plainly , a boring 90 minutes of film. It's one thing to make a controversial film if it is riveting or even somewhat interesting, but this was just a bad movie. And I hate to say that because I think Chloe Sevigny is a great actress and very underrated. And I won't even say she should've avoided this project, because it did seem to have potential. But to me, all the shock value and weirdness seemed to be there just for the sake of being weird, and that's just dumb. Overall, I was disappointed in this film."
4,Offbeat,"Other than all the cruelty portrayed towards cats, this was an odd little movie with realistically portrayed charachters. Kinda just watching someones real life I guess. Somewhat disturbing though due to the cat thing. I'm assuming they used fake cats..."
1,Exploitation,"This film could have ended arbitrarily at any point without sacrificing any meaningfulness, since it had none to begin with. I saw it out of curiosity. The fllm is a mess - it's basically the lowest of lowlives engaging in reprehensible behavior. I wish the tornado had dropped a few houses on these people. They're right out of Deliverance - except that movie was entertaining.I just waited for this to end. Thank God it finally did."
1,Don't subject yourself to this junk,"Trashy, exploitative, and pointless film which goes for shock value with no substance. A horrifyingly bad movie unless you like watching degenerate behavior. I am no prude, but this film stinks badly. I'm so glad it bombed at the box office. It deserved to!"
3,Like no other film,"When I got finished watching ""Gummo"" I said to my friend, ""That was the worst film I've ever seen ... but what about that part where the kid was eating spagetti in the dirty bath?""It is indeed a horrible film to view but it is filled with scenes that you will not be able to erase from your mind. It has no point, has no plot, makes no sense, but still at the same time it's unforgetable. It takes pride in making no sense. It almost takes pride in being a horrible film. Gummo is like a taped interview with an extremely insane man. You're job is to either try to make sense of it or just take it in and realize that sometimes life makes no sense."
1,worse then gummo on your shoe,"Kids was such a great movie, one had to be looking forward to seeing the Harmony Korine""s first feature film. Well, I don't think many will be looking forward to the next one. No plot, no story, no redeeming value. The is movie based around the theme of torturing cats and not much else. Not much else to say either."
2,Crappo,"This is a waste of time made by director with nothing to say, who still wants to be a filmmaker. Trash like this inevitably triggers reviews rife with words like ""genius,"" ""misunderstood,"" ""surreal,"" and ""cult."" The lower-middle-class white Midwest has become the happening place for hipster artists to go slumming for material, but all Korine seems to have gotten out of it is an episode of ""COPS"" slapped together with some cheesy film-school-assignment cinematography and editing. Too bad, because the film's premise (a town recently ravished by a tornado) could have made for a truly edgy exploration of an American social stratum that's usually ignored."
1,god awful,"I can't believe they didn't print my last review of this. I probably swore in it. Well, it made me that mad, and I only rented it. IF you're considering buying this, I seriously hope you have rented it. I enjoyed Kids, and could not sit through much of this. Just goes to show, Larry Clark was the force behind kids.Although I have Korine's script, and it's not half bad. I mean, it has a story and the characters are more interesting. However, this movie is only for those who a) want to punish themselves B) want to feel superior because they can force themselves to believe they like garbage."
1,A Failure,"The problem with Gummo is that there is no motivation in any of the film. Characters move from one disturbing scene into another directionless and lost. The whole dead cat thing is moronic and obvious. Bunny Boy is token as if the director is saying ""Wow check it out--I've got a character who serves no purpose! Is'nt that cool!"" Likewise taking a bath in dirty water is also pointless even for a film with arthouse aspirations. On the flipside the casting of a bunch of no names does lend to some realism no matter how forced it actaully is and the fact that there is no real plot isn't actually it's undoing--like a bad accident the director seems to want us to watch just because it's so insepid. In the right hands this may have worked."
2,It Drags - and Drags,This movie goes on and on about kids that seem to be clueless in the world. I think thatt it is not nearly as good as KIDS rent that if you want to see a good flick about gangs. And its by the same author so you wont offend him by renting it.
2,Kind of Boring,"The oddness of what I was seeing held my interest at first but it quickly grew numbing and tiresome. There was no real purpose to what was being shown, other than perhaps the director's attempt to be bizarre and ""out there, man."" A self-indulgent gross-out picture that overstays its welcome, it seemed much longer than its 90 to 100 minute running time. Just scene after scene after scene of pointless weird posturing. If there was some sort of point to it after all, well, who cares?"
3,Blown Away,"I don't think anyone can praise this film without first citing how disturbing its content is. But outside that point, this movie is penetrating and reminds us that -Kids- is no joke."
1,Sick and plotless garbage,"The young director, Harmony Korine, who made his debut with the controversal movie ""Kids"" got even more wierd and sick with Gummo. There's not even a plot, just a loose collage of scenes which is supposedly a documentary about a fictional town in Tennessee that had experienced a tornado. The acting is mostly improvised by unknowns and many of the scenes are grusome. Teenagers kill stray cats and sell them to the local butcher and then go out and sniff glue. A retarded girl is prostituted by her brother. A drunken homosexual pass is made at a dwarf. Two young men have a real fight and beat each other bloody. Cruelty is everywhere and every scene is a shocker. The cinematography is often grainy and blurred and voices are muffled and unclear. I'm the curious type and so I wanted to see this video. I was prepared to be shocked. But I was also bored because the story just didn't go anyplace. I'm surprised it got any kind of distribution at all. For the barf bag crowd only."
2,The easiest way to sound like an amateur film critic.........,"is to criticize a film for having ""no plot."" The point of making movies outside the studio system is to NOT have these requirements. On netflix, far more people chose to take the time to write a review of this film versus 'Kids.' In a theoretical way, you can tell how thought-provoking a film is by how many people take the time to share their thoughts and argue about it on the internet. There's no point in even trying to make a value judgement of a film when it's all interpretive anyway. This is one of the rare films that, after seeing, I went straight to my computer because I knew people would be arguing about it on the internet. It makes me ask myself: if I were a filmmaker, would I want the film that everybody likes passingly - or the film that everyone hates lovingly?"
4,bizarre. art.,"Leonard Maltin has cheese for brains. I can understand hating this film, but complaining about how it drags on or calling it directorially awful is indicative of brain freeze. Korine challenges the pathetic, crumbling conventions of Hollywood films and gives us in the midst of all the ugliness and grime a glimpse of true beauty."
2,WTF was that,This movie RAPED my mind..... I have no Idea what I watched...I recommend it for those that are crazy or wish to be crazy
1,poor wht trash,"this movie is not worth the one star i had to give it, young bad a$$ kid with a filthy mouth"
3,Wish they were lighter,"These are a good product, but they are a bit heavy, so they tug on the cord if you've got the Smartwrap attached while your earphones are in your ears."
4,"So you want to know about Babylon 5, huh?","Andy Lane's unauthorized guide is a book that covers a wide spectrum of interests: plot breakdowns, references to history, mythology, religion; who's who with both characters and the people portraying them; not to mention occasional opinions or behind the scenes tidbits only insiders know about.The book covers not just the TV show but related novels and the comic series as well, intertwining all the information and cross referencing when needed. It has over 400 pages of easy to read information, and even has a 14 page index (very small print). I don't think I have read through a book so quickly that still kept my interest on each page.So whether you are a die-hard Babylon 5 fan, or are just curious as to what the upcoming hoopla is all about, this is a very good choice for reference material. Makes a better gift!"
4,An all around treasure for any Babylon 5 fan.,"I believe that this book is a book for anyone. If you're just starting to watch the show, or if you have been a fan from the begining, this has fun facts for all. However, there are a few mistakes in the episode descriptions, but that's it. It is a book that has a purpose, to enlighten any B5 fan with new facts, and a different outlook on the arc."
4,Cool and new stuff,Great to hear someone with own style these days. More interesting than KWS and J Lang.
4,Not a waste of your time,"The story was good, but, the acting was limited. I like vampire movies and I had never heard of this film prior to seeing it, so, I took a chance and saw it online. Your time is not wasted but you will end up seeing a B movie. I think Lance Henriksen could of been used more wisely as I think he is a fine actor."
2,"Overall, unpleasant","Spectrum Light Canola Mayo is an eggless mayonnaise substitute. I bought a jar of this at my local store, as it was on clearance and I'm trying to avoid eating real egg products. It has a very good smell, like real mayonnaise; however, I was put off by its gummy texture. It has a passable flavor-somewhat tangy like the real stuff-but it also tastes very floury. The biggest downside to this mayo is that it leaves a terrible aftertaste for hours. I won't be buying this mayonnaise again."
1,"Warped neck, needs a truss rod","I found this guitar covered in dust and without strings in Afghanistan. Strung it with nylon strings. Fretboard has a slight bulg up at 13th to 17th frets. This causes all strings to fizzle against the those frets when attempting to play above the 6th fret. Sorta limits ya on what can be played lol. This guitar has no truss rod which is the cause of the warp. If you are considering this guitar, you are not wanting spend much money. I highly recommend spending another 50 bucks for a guitar with a truss rod."
5,I love this book!,"This is the most precious book-it really helps us girls realize how great we can look and feel if we put in just a little effort. The suggestions are great, the drawings are fantastic, and I especially love how there are many situations: work casual, weekend casual, date, meet the parents, etc. Fantastic!"
4,Mr.,Ordered as a replacement for an earlier model which had a blue light to indicated on position. Aside for the missing light everything else works to satisfaction.
2,a book which should be read,"Pennycook is convincing in arguing that there is a profoundly colonialist dynamic driving the English teaching industry. However, his thesis that things can never change is depressing, utterly mistaken, and (itself) symptomatic of the colonialist mentality he purports to criticise. Even so, the book should be read by people who intend to teach English overseas."
4,Olympus Stylus,"The Stylus 770SW is nice for my purposes.It is small enough and durable enough to leave in my computer bag for when I need a camera.Pictures have all come out great.The download process did not seem to be intuitive. But, on both PC and Mac once it is plugged in using the USB cable and turned on the PC download option seemed the only good choice; the downloads went surprisingly easy on either platform once you pick PC download.I bought both the case and cover for it. If you get the cover for it, it becomes an exercise in pealing the cover off to plug in the USB cable, to remove the battery or to get to the memory card. It was helpful for giving us, my wife end me, peace of mind that it is protected.My family gave it to me s a present to replace another camera which ate batteries. Comparitively, I've been happy with the battery life so far.I'm looking forward to trying it under water to go snorkeling."
3,Pixel Problems,"It's a very durable camera with overall good quality - excellent for children/infants who grab the camera when you aren't looking. A little too sophisticated sometimes for simple point and shoot because the default setting upon turning it on makes pictures blurry. Additionally, smack dab in the middle of the screen/lens/memory area is a pixel ""dark"" spot that doesn't consistently go away no matter what you try. It is a ghost spot that is electronically driven (not dirt driven)."
2,snorkler,"The camera is easy enough to use, and it takes outstanding photographs. It is difficult to see what you are taking a picture of without an eyepiece. I took care of the camera exactly as the instructions, but had to buy 2 new batteries, they would charge, but not register in the camera. I did return the camera and was very quickly fixed. I like olympus products. If you are looking for a cheap, easy underwater camera, I suggest getting the upgrade of this model, the one with the eyepiece, you won't regret the extra money."
3,I am sorry,I am sorry I picked this for my first digital camera/ It isnt much of a camera / yes it is water proff / the lcd screen is usless in sunlight the buttons are far too small AND if you are not blessed with tiny fingers there is no good way tho hold the case and not end up with a didget in the frame / I would gladley trade this in for an old kodak OVER PRICED OVER RATED I WANT MY FILM !!!!!!!
3,To High Tech,I thought I'd try out this Olympus camera because of it's water resistant features. I live in Florida where it rains quite often and I'm out boating in the Gulf of Mexico too. It functions well but changing from video to still shots is time consuming plus I miss the view finder. When you try to look at the pics you took all the tech print is in the way. It's to hard to see what your focusing on in the sunlight. There's so many modes to choose from I'm not sure what one is best and I'm still not sure where the macro mode is either. There's not even a slide lock on the wrist band strap to tighten it around your wrist. I'll probably sell it and get another Canon Elph. They're so much eaiser to use. Wish they'ed make a water resistant one.
2,Bunch of short tracks,"This CD was originally released as part of the Beat the Boots II boxset. Zappa took old bootleg recordings of his concerts and released them on CD and took the money for himself (which was the right thing to do).Most of this comes from a concert with what I call the Ike Willis band. Zappa had a semi-stable band with Ike Willis for many years. On this album are Ed Mann (who has a very nice solo album if you can find it, Barrow, Caoluita, Mars, Walley and Wolf. A date is not given, but I am guessing it is from a tour just after Joe's Garage part 1 was released.There are two tracks from something called the Rueben and the Jets tour, but features the Flo and Eddie band.The CD title is a good name for it as it features mostly short, silly tracks.The sound quality is OK but not great. It is not what I would call professional quality, but it is better than many ""professional"" live albums released today. It is better than many of the Dave Matthews releases."
2,The Clasp is awful...,"This is a very stylish watch, but I find that the clasp will constantly unlatch while I have it on. Also, removing links from the band involves permanently cutting the links off with a knife. I think the band is too tight now, but I can't loosen it."
4,Great book for teaching elections facts,I am a 5th grade teacher and I found this book very helpful in providing explanations to my students about various elections processes. The kids really enjoy as it is written in a question/answer format. I recommend this to anyone who wants to know more about our elections!
3,Infighting wrecked this album,"Keith and Mick were squabbling throughout the making of this album and the disension compromises much of the music. The middle five songs are generally sub-par except for Charlie's riveting drumming. Several of the songs sound discordant and hastily-produced (""Fight"" is a prime example) yet there are also some surprising high points. The Stones' cover version of ""Harlem Shuffle"" is three minutes of sheer perfection, the apex of the record by a wide margin.""Back to Zero"" is catchy and clever, but still fluff, with lyrics probably scribbled by Mick on the back of an envelope three minutes before they hit the studio. The album ends on a high note with Keith's beautiful ballad, ""Sleep Tonight."" Though Keith's voice is always lousy, he still sings this with a poignant sweetness.I would avoid this album unless you're a die hard Stones fan. Opt instead for ""Tattoo You"" if you want a better sampling of their later catalogue."
2,Stones at their so-called worst - but this CD is still okay,"The only original Stones song that I like on this CD (and that most seem to like) is 'One hit (to the body), the other songs that I like are the cover versions 'Harlem Shuffle' and 'Too Rude'. That's about the only songs on this CD worth mentioning. I still listen to the other songs, but Mick does sound weary on this CD. But even at their worst, Stones are still better than half the sh!t out there now. And I did pick up this CD at a bargain, so I ain't complaining much. But this one is for die-hard Stones fans, that's why I own this one!"
3,"dirty work? not so dirty, but certainly underrated","Dirty Work is not the best Rolling Stones record of the 1980s. The Stones began the 1980s with Emotional Rescue (1980), Tatto You (1981), Still Life (1982), and Undercover (1983).Dirty Work is not as good as any of them: it's not as dirty as Undercover, it's not as inspired as Tattoo You, it's not as original as Emotional Rescue. But Dirty Work is certainly one of the most underrated Stones record.One Hit is a great rock. Harlem Shuffle is a nice cover. Dirty Work is a very energetic piece. And then you have some of the best Keith.Dirty Work is the first album in which Keith sings two songs. Too Rude is a beatiful slow reggae which became a staple in his tour with the Expensive Winos. And then there is Sleep Tonight, which is a great slow song, in the best Rolling Stone tradition. It is probably Keith's best singing performance."
4,Rolling Stones CD,"One of the best CDS'I own by This Group! They still have what it takes to get people of all ages to rock, get up and move! Their music is timeless!"
3,Mean -- Just What the Stones do Best!,"DIRTY WORK is the Stones' bastard child -- which is really something considering it's the meanest blokes in the biz we're talking about. But this devlish disc deserves to come in from the cold. It's not great overall -- but there are some profoundly nasty moments well worth holding on to.The album opens with a potent combination -- ONE HIT (TO THE BODY) followed by the bloodthirsty FIGHT. It's the Stones at their most volatile. Things get spotty after that, but the boys deliver one of their best moments of the '80s with the simple and slimey R&B; rant HAD IT WITH YOU. Keith sheds the macho poses on the closer, the surprisingly tender SLEEP TONIGHT.DIRTY WORK sure ain't LET IT BLEED -- but it does draw blood ... and isn't that why you liked the Stones in the first place?"
2,"Well, You Have To Give 'Em Some Credit","Upon listening to Dirty Work, I turned to my little sister and asked her, ""Do want to get this album? 'Cause I don't."" Dirty Work is mainly a mid-80's pop album, and I hate mid-80's pop. The album does have a few high points, though. It opens very well with the kick-butt ""One Hit (To the Body)."" ""Fight"" and ""Harlem Shuffle"" are okay. ""Winning Ugly"" is the same. Keith's ""Sleep Tonight"" is beautiful, possibly the best song on here. Ian Stewart's short boogie-woogie piano at the end, though, comes close to stealing the show, despite the fact that it's less than 20 seconds long. The Stones messed up on this one, but they recovered soon after."
1,Down Right Bad,"When the band recorded this album, their was a huge rift between Mick Jagger & Keith Richards. The album suffers from their fighting, as it sounds like no one wants to be there. The album is saved by the album's opener, the frantic, ""One Hit (To The Body)"" which has a caustic energy of an addict looking for his next fix and the closer ""Sleep Tonight"" in which Mr. Richards sings with poignancy. In between, there is no redeeming songs lead by the weak ""Winning Ugly"", the awful cover ""Harlem Shuffle"" and ""Hold Back"". The band mailed this one in and it left doubts as to whether they were capable of coexisting with one another."
2,Dumb slasher flick..,"If you want to see the girls on the cover of this DVD in sexy situations then forget it. Forget about having a few laughs watching a reasonably engaging slasher flick as well. This is one of the most boring horror movies that I have seen in a while. Skip this dreck, watch something else."
5,Best allergy med I've ever used.,"This is the best allergy remedy for a headache, congestion and runny nose. I recommend it to my friends all the time. Thanks - good seller. Will probably buy again."
4,Kirbyjon recognizes how we need to live lives of total faith,"This book calls on us to not leave God in the safe places where we want God to be contained. Instead, Kirbyjon recognizes, and encourages us to recognize, that God does not want some part of us, but God wants all that we have to bring... and that God wants to bless us the same way. In reality, this book is in line with a long Christian tradition that answers the question, ""what does God want from us"" with ""Everything we are and have"". But in this day, that is revolutionary enough."
5,Startling Revelations,"I have not seen anything like this in print: startling revelations about the everyday living conditions of Palestians, under constant control and surveillance by Israelis: Homes are demolished, numerous checkpoints demand hours, sometimes days, of waiting to move from one section to the other, settlers have illegally occupied hills where they live with guns pointed down,and the violent deaths on their streets at the hands of Israelis go for the most part unreported to Western press.The book is a cry for a balanced investigation of this conflict which is at the heart of the confrontation between the Arab and Western world."
1,Awful and Very Disappointing DVD,"I have never been so disappointed with a DVD ever! I purchased the DVD to place into a 2012 time-capsule for my granddaughter; which I thought would be a great ideal for her to review when she was older. Was I in for a rude awakening! I repeat ""DON'T PURCHASE THE DVD... PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY!!!! Unless you have money to throw away.I only wish I could rate the DVD as ""Negative 10 Stars."" Unfortunately, the lowest rating I can give is a one star; which, in my opinion is much too high!"
1,2012 Olympic Gymnastics,I was expecting much more e.g. the top 5 on each apparatus. Lots of pommel-horse and very little else. A waste of money.
4,Cute and Not Too Loud,"I saw this at the store because it's on my 6 year daughter's Christmas list. I usually don't care for electronic toys, but this one was cute--especially for Barbie and the Magic of Pegasus fans. It does something different each time you press its foot--it vibrates, makes some cooing noises, and its cheeks glow red. Best of all it's not too loud or annoying."
4,HIMYM,"The show is so funny, but when I got it in the mail, the box that I got it in was broken!!! It looked bad on the outside and the extra disk holder on the inside was broken. I was giving it as a gift too, and didn't have time to return it for another. That really stunk!!"
4,Season 2 takes this series to a new level,"I was initially skeptical about purchasing the second season of How I Met Your Mother, simply because the first season just wasn't funny enough. Dont get me wrong, I enjoy the show but its just didn't have as many laughs as I would have liked. But season 2 changes that. Apart from a slow start, the season has one hit episode after another. Whether it be Robin's teenage pop-princess nightmare or Marshals effort to get back into the dating game. Oh and you get to see Barney in a play too! What more could you ask for. The bottomline: season 2 of How I Met Your Mother is creative, innovative and most important of all, its funny as hell."
3,not a review,"if anyone is curious to find out what other metal bands Philadelphia has to offer, check out: www.myspace.com/suffertoascend"
3,It's OK,"My 3 year old son is a little bored with this video. He loves Scooby Doo, Super Why and The Backyardigans, but this won't keep his attention."
5,My Nephew LOVES this!!,I have a 3 year old nephew who cannot get enough of this DVD. He claps when the dynamite goes off and names off every machine as they come on the screen - I highly reccomend this for any preschooler.
1,Mamas & The Papas: The Very Best of,"Very bad advertising: there are no music clips AT ALL.It's all interviews with 20 second bursts of their music, every now and then.If you are a Fan and love watching The Mamas & Papas interviews then this is for you.If you are after their Music plus Video Clips then don't buy this DVD as there is NO music clips on it!!!!!"
3,classica ibiza,"cd one is a classic house disc, not mixed but straight forward house muzik for the head. its got alot of oldschool piano flavor to it. cd two is more tribal and progressive from the get go. also not mixed but worth the listening. cd three is mixed. its a fair mix also. its not the greatest mix in the world but one you can kick back and enjoy the muzik."
5,Great Stuff,I used AS before and really loved the results. I got off track with working out for a while and now getting back into it hard again. I just turned 50 and now I remember how much I loved AS. This is the best combination of everything you need all together in one pack.
2,Book Review on Excel 97 Advanced,"I've read both Excel 97 Step by Step (basic) and this advanced topics. The difference is really a bit more in-depth on some topics found in the basic edition. Unlike other step by step series, this one does not even have review excerises at the end of each chapter. I found a couple of the chapters such as writing different formulas and functions rather confusing and perhaps totally unnecessary for business use. Some topics are even ""repeats"" of what were on the basic edition of Excel 97 Step by Step.Out of other Step by Step books that I've read, this one is probably the worst."
3,It's a cheap tray,You wanted an inexpensive tray for your Rack Mount Case? This is it. works just fine (I use it to hold a Blu-Ray player). The overall strength is B+ but the coating was flaking and there was visible red rust on the steel. Because of the coating issues I have to rate the whole piece as a C-. But it works... you get what you pay for. I am happy with the purchase despite the flaws.
5,Nice Product.,"This was a good product and it is working as intendet. This is not a heavy duty shelf, but for small items, it is great as well as it is compact"
5,2 happy dachshunds!,"Love the coupler. I saw one when I lived in Europe & decided I needed one for my dachshunds. They walk great together & this makes walking 2 dogs so easy for me. The only problem I have it the fact that one is a puppy & sometimes doesn't want to wait for the other to go potty & tries to pull her, but that is because she is much more inexperienced with being on a leash & I'm sure that'll iron out in time."
3,Double Leash,Great idea but one dog walks faster than the other and ended up dragging him. No fault to the product.
2,Confusing,"Umm, this hard to understand and quiet disapointing. I dont even get what the plot was... not worth your time"
1,"Bought 4 Christmas for Special Needs child, it was broken :(","I purchase Christmas early, so I ordered this on Oct 7 for my Autistic grandchild. when it arrived, I just hid it in my closet until it was wrapped and put under the tree. We were VERY disappointed when my grandchild opened it with excitement on Christmas morning to find it in pieces! So of course, the time is up on getting a full refund or replacement. We shipped it back and are hoping for the best."
5,The best book on Liberated Quilting,"I have been a quilter for a few years but wanted to ""branch out"" and not use someone else's patterns. Then I found Liberated Quilting -- and have been liberated ever since. If you want to go ""outside the block,"" try this book. She also has books on Liberated String Quilting. Google her name and you will get all her books -- each is great."
4,Another great release,"I have yet to be dissapointed with anything by Throwdown, and this cd is no exception. I do think the sound has changed a bit, & I agree with a previous reviewer who said there sounds to be a Pantera influence. Anyone who has listened to alot of Pantera should pick up on that right off. Its one of the first things I thought when I heard it. Very Phil Anselmo sounding vocals. Not quite as ""hardcore"" as Haymaker. The vocals & guitars seem to have moved a little to the metal side of hardore, but like I said its still a great album & worth buying."
1,This DVD is horrible,"DO NOT BUY THIS! I bought it, thinking it would be cool/fun...it is complete garbage. You can make your own ""collection"" with a VCR and it will come out 100% better. Do yourself a favor and ignore this temptation."
3,DMX IS THE BOMB BUT.....,This DVD is a cool item for the real DBl-R2 Fan. I Bought It because im a tru fan!!But it's nothing special. There are only the video clips but nothing special further..So I bought it for my collection..A WANNAHAVE 4 THE REAL RUFF RYDER!!!
5,It's amazing,"You need to go watch all of doctor who right now, because it is literally the best show ever made."
4,"If your a Dr. Who fan, you will enjoy.","I have been a Dr. Who fan for many years, and am glad to see the series continue. The new series remains true to the original series with plenty of Daleks and metal men. Only gave four stars because some of the story lines are a bit contrived."
5,The last full season of David Tennant,"Oh, how I miss Tennant! Most of his other works don't make it ""across the pond"", so his fans don't get to see enough of him! We all agree that Hollywood is STUPID to not give him a series or star him in a film over here, but what can you do?His final season as The Doctor was quite brilliant and I, personally, loved Donna! Finally a character who didn't have a crush on him and could go toe to toe with him! (Don't get me wrong, the love story with Rose, was AWESOME, but after that he needed a buddy!) She's brash, and witty, and won't let his ego get too big! She's tough, and smart, and sometimes even a wee bit sexy. The Vashta Nerada are introduced in this season, and I hope hope hope that they are brought back again someday... they are wonderfully frightening!"
4,Amazon FAILS TO LIST the FINAL 4 episodes of season 4!,"Doctor who is a great show. But for some reason BOTH Amazon and Netflix fail to list the last for episodes of season 4, including the finale which explains why **spoiler alert** Matt Smith takes over as the Doctor in season 5.This information is **not** a spoilerafter episode 15 ""The Next Doctor"" comes:16 Planet of the Dead17 Waters of Mars18 The End of Time Part 119 The End of Time Part 2All great episodes and my god, missing the 2 part finale, crazy!"
4,"Awesome, with only one disappointment","This is by far the best, coolest, most eventful season of Doctor Who. David Tennant pretty much rules as the 10th Doctor and Catherine Tate is perfect as Donna.For Canadians: If you watched season 4 on CBC this fall, you NEED to buy this DVD because they cut out some very important scenes, especially in the finale (lots of explanations that are pretty much necessary)The only disappointment I found was that outtakes were not included, and that's enough to lose a full star otherwise I would have rated it 5/5."
4,Doctor Who Season 4,"I'm a HUGE Doctor Who fan, so I was super excited when I got my 4th season in the mail! (it was a couple days late so that kinda bugged me but other than that once it got there all was forgotten) This season is my second favorite season so far so I'm sure any Who fan would be happy to see it. The only thing that's not so great about it is that there aren't as many special features on it as there have been on past seasons of Doctor Who box sets. Other than that it's great, I love it, and totally recommend it to anyone!"
5,Best Companion ever !!!,"This is the Season that rocks ! We wrap up the Rose story , Use an ancient foe. And even have on alot of the past .. including a peek at the future . You ROCK Sarah Jane and Luke ! See the show The Sarah Jane Adventures .. for those not in the know ,, plus Torchwood .. cant forget the Captain .Can not wait to see what happens in London this Christmass!PSBring Back Donna Noble! Best companion ever !!Well at least she wasn't always trying to shag the doctor!"
5,Dr. Who Fanatic,"If a Dr. Who fan, who couldn't like this series? Another interesting new sidekick and a series of strange new adventures. While each story is complete in itself (including the two-part stories), the whole season definitely wraps up nicely in the end episode."
5,BEST SEASON YET!!!,"I LOVEE THIS SEASON! Donna is aMaZiNgLy played by the one and only Catherine Tate, and of course the Misters Tennant and Davies (as well as the entire Doctor Who team) deliver once more! The episodes are amazing!! And I cried for like two hours when I saw the ending! Its soooo sad, but sooo good, too!I LOVE LOVE LOVE DOCTOR WHO!!!!!!!"
5,I like dr who,It is a great show! Very clear picture and sound I hope I can afford to get amazon prime again soon
2,Too expensive.,"I bought series 1,3, and 4 before Christmas 2009 for $41.99 each from Amazon. Now I see it's going for $62 a piece. What's going on??? I love this show, maybe it's worth $62, but come on guys, give us a break. Don't take advantage of the situation by increasing the price, you might loose some fans out there who are not willing to fork out that much dough!"
1,Not a Winner,"This video was not nearly as compelling as the other mighty machine videos we bought. There is only one fire fighter episode on it - and it involves fire school - not fighting a real fire. It bored my three year old ""vehicle crazed"" grandson."
2,not so good,not very powerful. does not flex very much at all. the head design is not to my liking. it does not get very hot.
2,cool and tacky,"I'm satisfied with the reach and vibration but the heat, available only at the tip of the wand, is trivial. Additionally, I would prefer hard, smooth surfaces for ease of use. The tacky contact surfaces don't move well over clothed or hairy skin."
1,pulse too weak,the product pulse is far too weak to provide any benefits for any tight or sore muscle areas on the body
1,Too expensive,The product is what it says it is...but twice as expensive as the extension cord you could get at the local Home Depot!
4,"A very entertaining read, you won't get bored","This dated book still serves as an entertaining and somewhat historical account of the seedy behavior of movie stars past. It's hard to determine just where the facts stopped and the sensationalized gossip starts, but for the most part alot of the information can be verified by research. Plain dull facts do not sell books so Anger cannot be blamed for adding some spice to these stories. This is actually a good study of human nature and how a privileged few behave when they hit the big time, then react when the inevidible fadeaway comes. Many parallels can be found in sports and the music industry where sudden fame and wealth changes people. People will always be fascinated with the lifestyles of their heroes and idols. Anger does a good job of dishing up the aspects these idols don't want their adoring public to know."
1,Utter Balderdash,"How anyone could be gullible enough to believe the easily-disprovable ""facts"" in this book is beyond me. Anger (a failed actor and director) got his revenge out on the town that scorned him. There are too many ludicrous factual errors and miscaptioned photos for me to list herein, but suffice it to say that (to paraphrase a comment on Lillian Hellman) every word in it is a lie, including ""and"" and ""the."" Legitimate historians everywhere should curse the existence of this book."
4,A thought provoking examination of Hollywood,"While many perceive Kenneth Anger as a unlikable, bitter, iconoclast who else could have captured the subject of Hollywood's dark side with such stamina and dark jest.This book for me makes any star gazer see the real side of fame, fortune, and power.Supposedly Anger and others were trying to make Hollywood Baby into a movie. I do hope that someday it does get done. Just the thought of the ""Business"" and it's dark side depicted on celluloid would be like one looking in a mirror and realzing that you are real and fallable.I urge all to enjoy this book for what it is. A complete and candid version of some of Hollywood's greatest in some of their most darkest hours when the cameras weren't rolling. It also reveals how the studios would protect their commodities at all costs."
1,reader,"I have never written a review on a book before, but after reading this book, I had to. This book is the worse I have ever read. I read a lot of biographies, and this book is so poorly written and full of lies, it is just not worth it."
5,"Scandalous, and intriguing!","I've had this book over 30 years and just reread it this week. There are stories here that you won't find on the internet biographies of these long ago stars, photos too that are probably lost or too disrespectful to publish, but oh, so interesting! Sordid and very believable!"
4,"Movie Idiotic, As Scary as a Linus But Women Are Gorgeous","The scariest thing about these two films is the DVD cover. The actual monsters in the film are as scary as Linus from Peanuts but the women get lots of screen time and lots of camera tilts and pans. In Kiss me, they are hynotized go-go dancers and in Bare Mountain, they are bare and I presume there's a drawing of a mountain somewhere. This one is a real oddball setup but this is one the cleanest prints ever from SW and under bright studio lights, you get every detail on how gorgeous, & all-natural the women are - lots of slow pans, tilts and closeups.They are essentially topless throughout and they are gorgeous - all natural and of course, way before the days of tattoos. Both are in color and great looking prints. The extras and trailers are all great. One of the best SW 2-fers. This is a keeper."
2,Weak on HIPAA Security!,"If you are looking for a solid review of the HIPAA Security Rule, I would suggest looking elsewhere. The breadth and depth of this chapter is very narrow (a mere 25 pages of shallow content) and I suspect it was actually written before the Final Security Rule was released in February of this year (2003). The frameworks for assessing Security Policicies and Procedures are nearly non-existent. While the book does have some solid HIPAA content, it's definitely not geared towards accurately assessing one's HIPAA Security Posture."
3,Good information; poor editing.,"The book has some very useful information, but the style and or lack of editing detracts and distracts from its readability. For example: on page 2 the entire 4th paragraph is repeated word for word on page 7. On page 7 the 7th paragraph is repeated on page 9. The last paragraph on page 12 is identical to the first paragraph on page 13. On page 546 the first and third paragrpahs are identical, and the second and fourth paragraphs are identical. When reading along one gets a sense of deja vu and suspects they picked up the reading from the wrong starting point. When reading along one gets a sense of deja vu and suspects they picked up the reading from the wrong starting point. :) In summary, useful information, but fire the editor."
5,Privacy Officer Handbook,"Wonderful, simply wonderful. This book both explained and summarized the requirements of HIPAA in a manageable form. I have been assigned as our clinics Privacy officer and this book has helped me immeasurably. Thank you Mr. Pabrai."
1,Buyer beware,"As most others have said, tech support sucks.I purchased the unit for bridge mode, and the firmware it came with bricks the unit when you switch it to bridge mode. Completely worthless. I had to send it back, which was an ordeal, and they charged me!In bridge mode, it will only work for a few hours before freezing up. Power cycle it and it comes back. Don't put it where you can't get to it."
4,There is no WDS mode....,"If used as an access point, this is a 5 star product. Setup is very easy and coverage is good.While this product advertises a WDS mode (even in the user's manual) it simply doesn't exist and it can't be used as a repeater. However, when used in conjunction with the HWUR54G range extender, the combo is simply awesome providing an excellent signal everywhere with WPA security.The nice designs, simple setups, and overall performance of these products will keep me a Hawking Tech fan for some time. I did not use phone support but Tech Support replied to all e-mails to address my questions and/or concerns."
2,You can skip this one,"Cuba has done an amazing job of switching over to organic, local food production. They did so to survive the assinine embargo of thier island, but in doing so they have shown the way for all of us to move to a sane mode of food production. You would want this book to be a delightful description of that process. You would be wrong. It is a leaden, tedious exercise in socialist writing with all the wit and charm of a phone book. Skip the book and just go to Cuba and see the results for yourself. Then come home and plant a garden."
2,Some good points but nothing new to me and I never even read,For someone who doesn't even read that much. I picked this book because I thought it would present some new ideas and maybe help me look at things differently. Not that it doesn't try; but this book isn't for anyone who is already extremely creative and brilliant and can roll with the punches life throws using logic and persistence. I don't think it's a waste of time but it is a little passe for the bright and the modern.
3,Help me understand the cost.....,"You know, I should leave the review AFTER I've read the book, but for any of you who care about what the book may look like...before you spend almost 50 bucks you may want to know that this is a very small book, and if you order it from here you can be sure there is a sticker on it that is literally huge and irremovable without something that dissolves glue.So much for appearances....once I get the sticker off of it (no easy feat as it is about the size of my hand) maybe I can write a review about the book itself. Here's to hoping it's magical."
2,pith poor,"the best thing about this book is the hardback binding with its cool sparkly cover. the contents are pithy, but mundane. there are no new observations on making art. his insistent personification of fear and making is sad. there are much better book about overcoming resistence and making art. but if you like pretty sparkly things, you'll love the cover."
5,"Finally a perspective on creative block I can relate to, act on and benefit from.","For years I've been labeled a ' creative ' by others. I never knew whether to take the label as a compliment or not.There a times when I am 'in the flow' and times when no amount of effort seems to break thru the block. I've struggled to understand why it's easy some days, and hard others. Why some of the work product is good, and other work product isn't fit to print.Now I know why. It's resistance. It's a good thing, and there is a strategy to deal with it.If you are a writer, artist, an entrepreneur, inventor or other creative type, and struggle to deliver great product on a consistent basis, read this book. Apply the simple principles, and your muse will find you."
3,"Some encouragement, mixed with confusion","Some important insights derived from the authors' years of experience as an artist... unfortunately he has included his misguided and perverse understanding of spiritual things, and a fair share of profanity. Read with caution - eat the meat and spit out the bones."
5,Very thought provoking,This was a very motivating and thought provoking book. It gave me an interesting perspective on myself and my ability to create and write. I took my time and really thought about the message of resistance. I now know the enemy and what I must do to overcome it so that I can be more productive. I am very touched by the last chapter in the book. Create what you are meant to create don't let others and yourself lose out on what you were meant to do. I highly recommend this book.
3,No es exactamente lo que esperaba,"No es exactamente lo que esperaba. Pensé que se trataba de una guía sobre cómo vencer la resistencia. En su lugar, me encontré con algo así como una colección de consejos individuales acerca de qué es, cómo identificarla, y algunos tips para vencerla, que muchas veces no llegan a llenar media página.Hubiese preferido algo más del tipo paso-a-paso, que comentarios sueltos."
5,Simplicity at its Finest,"Steven Pressfield makes a complex subject simple and easy to understand. The book created many 'ah-has' for me as I read (always a joy when that happens). After reading his book - I look at resistance through more patient eyes. Instead of letting it (resistance) call the shots, I simply recognize it for what it is and move on.Pressfield's writing is straight forward and no-nonsense which leaves the reader with no doubt or confusion...a skill that is most welcome in this world of complexities. A must read for everyone...strips the veil off of why we react the way we do, and gives us a strategy for changing that reaction."
5,I would have written this sooner but I had a book to read.,"If you are an artist, writer, lover or whatever your creative endeavor may be, you have no more excuses from now on after reading this book. This book gets you off your mental behind, or at least, it demonstrates that you have been sitting on yours all along. There are no more excuses. If you need one, let it be that you have to read this book.Now I would love to keep chatting, but I have work to do."
4,Helpful for Certain People,"If you are already a motivated person, there is no reason to read this book. If you have trouble dealing with procrastination, this book will definitely help you out! The author pinpoints exactly what keeps creative people from being creative and inspires you to tackle any obstacle in your way. Artists who only work when inspired, or who have trouble committing to a schedule will find this book useful. People who are already hard at work will not find any new ideas that they didn't already know."
1,Couldn't finish,"I just can't get through this. It is obvious that the author has a major problem with procrastination but labeling it ""the resistance"" and having three or more references to ""the resistance is"" on almost every page takes me nowhere.Where you taking me Steven? Gods and goddesses, wars and battles, Jung, Madonna, fluff on one page (""the Muse lights on our shoulder like a butterfly"") and f-words on the next?And what kind of book is this anyway? One or two paragraphs per page? Like a thought for the day calendar or a blog. Is this art? If this writing is a work of art then I'm the guy scratching his head in the gallery saying ""I don't get it""."
1,Too spiritual,"This book just not very good unless you're very spiritual or religious. The author talks way too much about angles to make any sense.Even if you try to look past the religious stuff, there is not really any useful tips on how to win the creative battle, as the author calls it. Unless you like to pray.I suppose I wasn't the target audience, but hard to know without reading it."
2,Not As Described,"I immediately felt deceived after opening my order. As I looked at the book, the upper right corner appeared to be chewed up by, what I'm guessing to be, a dog. The first half of the book's pages, while still completely readable, were torn, bitten off, and looked far below ""good condition"". In the overall appearance, this book looks below average and would not be aesthetically pleasing on a shelf.Buyer beware."
4,The War Of Art,"Easy to read, beautiful descriptive passages.I passed it on to my son, a musician. It is beneficial to anyone."
3,Thought -provoking,"Starts off in a way that is very easy to understand, and very easy to relate with, then it starts to get a bit odd in the latter end."
5,"Diagnosis, prescription, sacred text and benediction. All in one book.","I consumed this book ravenously in about three sittings. Pressfield ties our personal struggle to be authentic to our calling into something that transcends advice or even insight. Diagnosis, prescription, sacred text and benediction. All in one book.By half way through the book I knew that I wanted to give a copy of it to my daughter who is struggling to take her own self and talents seriously.One note, I found the Foreward by Robert McKee completely unworthy of Pressfield's writing. Ironically, McKee writes in a trite ego-centric style. Fortunately I don't read forewards first and I may just rip those pages out of the book before I give it to my daughter."
5,As fierce as it gets,"I have purchased ten copies of this book, and I imagine I will be ordering more, to give to all of my artist friends. This is a powerful book that inspires the reader to take bold leaps in their creative journeys...it has become my artistic manifesto!"
2,Redundant,"This book has some wonderful photos, mostly repetitve and the captions even more so. However, depending on how fanatical you are, the different locos and their appointments are detailed. I could only take so much repitition on Southern's pride in their green locos, polished bells and shiny cylinder covers."
3,Too much money!,"I have enjoyed this show on TLC and have been waiting for the box set of season one to be released. Unfortunately, TLC has decided to release each 1/2 hour episode on individual DVDs and charge nearly $20 for each one! I wouldn't pay $40 for the entire first season and I LOVE this show. I have all of the episodes on my DVR and I guess that is the only way I will be watching them unless TLC rethinks their decision."
2,A quick workout but not for beginners,"I have the Taebo tapes and participate in a class at the gym- and those options are better than using this video. The video is not good for beginners as the moves are not explained, and the participants do exercises/stretches before Billy explains them so it feels as though you are behind. Also his count is off. If you are familiar with Taebo this tape can serve as a quick workout. It is divided into 2 sections and are can be used alone or in combination depending on your time. It is also not as strenuous as the Taebo tapes. So if you have an injury or can't shower after exercising, this tape is also an option."
2,Looks like fun if you've already been to 10 Classes,"It may be charming and the class participants may look cool in their urban work out wear, but this is not a tape that provides you with the basics to avoid injury. Good positioning and placement are hardly explained so before you start kicking and punching you will have to go elsewhere to find out how to do it right. The transitions between moves are not called out for the class, they just happen. Frankly, I was hugely disappointed and am hoping his set of two videos Tae-Bo provides a better instructional section."
2,Don't know what to think,"I recently purchased the two-pack TaeBo workout and also bought the Crunch video at the same time. I didn;t open it because I was going to see how I liked the TaeBo workouts first. Well, I think the Crunch workout was dated by Amazon to have been made this year, i think it was made before the TaeBo workouts, I looked up the TaeBo web-site and they even said that the Crunch was NOT in the TaeBo series and that people shouldn't think of it as one of the series just because Billy Blanks is on the cover. He didn't really teach it right, the moves were the same, but you can see he was less experienced in Crunch than he was in TaeBo, his instructions were very unclear and he didn't seem to be confident in teaching it. It was my own fault for not consulting the TaeBo web-site to see what I should have gotten. I wish I could return it now (my curiosity got to me and I opened the Crunch tape)."
1,Tae-bo WHAT? I stepped in place for 30 minutes.,"I purchased this tape with the impression that is was going to be a high-energy, challenging, fast-paced workout. Well, it was energetic. It was challenging to follow due to MAJOR lack of instruction. Banks neglected to instruct the proper positions on many sets. It was extremely difficult to follow and I found myself lost. I liked regular tae-bo and wanted a quick tape for variety....this Definately is not it."
1,Not what one would expect from CRUNCH or Billy Blanks,"I've heard a lot of great things about the CRUNCH club and have worked out to Billy Blank's tapes which were great. I bought this video hoping to get another great workout. Boy, was I disappointed. The first part (kickology) is a regular instructional video which is fine. The second part (Tae Boxing Jam) was very dissapointing. While Billy was saying one thing, people in the back started doing a new set. There was no connection between what Billy was saying and what they were doing until they were well into the set. I didn't even break a sweat. Yes Billy is charming and all, but it's not what one looks for when selecting an exercise video."
2,Good workout-bad editing,"Billy Blanks is in his usual form in this workout, showing how certain moves can be used in self-defense situations and motivating in a suave way. But this video looks like someone taped it from the TV and edited out the commercials. At one point you're just getting into the exercise, and it cuts to the Crunch logo without warning and a whole other segment begins. The background people know the routine better than Billy does, as he's often standing there talking while the group continues with the workout. He also stops once or twice to show off his own moves and encourages his group behind him to do so as well. It's a good workout if you don't mind the choppy editing and lack of cueing on Billy's part. You really have to apply yourself and fill in the blank spots in this workout (NO pun intended)."
1,Glad I Didn't Buy This Video,"I was at the store and was deciding which video to buy this one or ""Tae Boe Foundation & Energy"". I am so glad I didn't buy this video after reading all the negative reiviews. Thank god my mom talked me out of getting this tape. Get the ""Tae Boe Foundation & Energy"" video instead. It has a basic about 66 minute long section where Billy goes through the moves step by step and a heart- pumping Energy section.P.S- I'm not a kid- I don't have a login"
4,Great for kids,"I have used this product for over a year on my 3 year old's bed. She jumps, climbs, plays, kicks, tantrums, etc... on this bed. It has been a REALLY big help when she has gotten sick in bed AND for potty training accidents. Yes, it tore once a few months ago, but then we flipped it over. Overall, it lasted us about 1.5 years and I'm about to buy another one. For the price and for our use (to contain kid ""fluids"") it has been a great purchase. I would highly recommend it to other parents on a budget."
5,Best saw I have ever owned.,"I needed a saw desperatly when my previous Delta (20+ years old), finaly gave in. Amazon couldn't (read: wouldn't) try to beat another online deal, so I went with CPO Delta. Saved $37 & had it delivered for free right to my shop within two days!Now, about the saw. What is the difference between this and a cabinet saw? The cabinet! It is a large heavy and heavy duty saw that is so accurate it is amazing. Let's face it, we want the saw to look nice and have some nice features, and it does, but the real critical factor is accuracy and this saw delivers.One of the other very noticable features about this saw is how quiet it is. I actually have music playing in my shop and still hear it with the saw running. I will admit that I am a total Delta fan and have several pieces from them, but I guess that is a product of being a happy and satisfied customer. [...]"
5,Really works for us!,"I use this leash when walking my Cavalier King Charles Spaniel - we leave in a rural area and this gives him a chance to roam a bit but then it is also easy to bring in should there be a car. I've had one for about a year, and it's about time to buy another. The one we have is still fine, but looking a bit frayed."
5,"Good leash, comfortable too","Leash is very comfortable and gives your dog some room to roam on your walks. It seems sturdy and is thick enough without being too heavy. My dog's behavior has improved being on a longer leash, he's more responsive and doesn't struggle nearly as much as he did a 5ft leash."
4,Good Quality,I use this leash every day and it performs well. Good quality. Well worth the money. I would recommend it to anyone committed to properly training their dog.
2,Not very durable,My bichon chewed right through this rope within 48 hours. It did not even look as if he was really chewing on it but rather playing with it. I had to tie the two chewed ends together just to continue using it.
5,Great,"This is a great product, very sturdy. I have a Lab and he chews through everything, and I mean everything! He has chewed the cable cords to a lot of electronics, he has chewed off three window screens, he has chewed a hole in the back of my couch, he even chewed a hole in my carpet - like, an actual hole in the carpet, no joke. Well, this is very sturdy, I've never seen him chew this, and it hasn't broken on me yet. It has survived all types of weather, including freezing ice and snow storms. It is very reasonably priced too."
4,This movie is quite funny and scary at the same time!!!,"This movie is one of the few scary movies that actually has a plot!!! The haunted house plays hysterical antics on the writer living in the house to drive him crazy and move away. It makes a dead sword fish on the wall come alive!!! Noone else but him can see it, because when other people show up it stops!!! His next door neighbor(Norm from Cheers) that is a fanatic believes he is crazy, and pokes fun at him. I especially like the fat ugly woman(either a ghost or hillucination) that goes after the writer is very funny!!! This movie make you bust out laughing, and then shutter in fear!!!"
4,A good entertainment horror comedy film.,"Director Steve Miner does good job making this film. This film some good laughs, good make-up special effects are fine and good actors. My only problem with the film is, the scenes where William Katt Character, remember about the war, the jungle are really fake, the film needed bigger budget.Still is one of the good old days of the eighties."
2,gave me split ends...,"I am almost done using this product. My hair grew pretty well fast. However, the shampoo and conditioner dried out my hair and it gave me ALOT of split ends.. i never had sooo much split ends in my life...UGHHH"
4,can be used in VERY CURLY HAIR and WORKS!,"I have curly hair type 3b-c, so you know what this means; dry hair, easy to break, very hard to grow long. I've been using this product for 3 months and I got ~3 inches. My hair looks healthy, hydrated and with volume. Now, If your hair is like mine, Fast shampoo will dry out your hair( using FAST conditioner don't help). However this is a problem VERY EASY to solve applying conditioners and deep treatments for you type of hair(DON'T use oil treatment on your scalp. According with them is deactivate the active compound in the shampoo). This shampoo will only provide the fast growth, you need to complement it with conditioners to keep your hair healthy. Yes, I'm washing my hair every day, and I'm not having any problem, hair lost or breaking.-"
1,Awful.,"Drys out hair and doesnt help in the least to make it grow. Smells bad too. Dont waste your money on this product. Try One n' only cleansing conditioner instead. Its like Wen, but cheaper. As in like, $12."
2,Don't waste your money,To start off with I am white with coarse wavy hair BSL length. After using this shampoo/condtioner for one month it made me break out along my hairline and caused my ahir to become very brittle and poofy-my hair barely grew half an inch. The only reason it gets two stars is because of the smell; other than that I would not recommend this to a friend and will not be purchasing this product again.
1,Save Your Hair And Money!,"I was hoping to speed the growth of my hair. I wish now that I would have left nature alone. This product made my hair so dry, thin, and lots of breakage. I have to get my hair cut super short! I'm so sad and mad about it all. I so wish I would have known this would happen."
3,FAST Shampoo and Conditioner,It is hard to tell after only a month's use of this product but I do think that it has improved my hair growth some. I am going to continue to use it.
1,SAVE YOUR SELF!!!!,"Save your self and YOUR MONEY!! Any shampoo that list SLS in its ingredients is BAD. Any shampoo that includes SLS will KILL your hair!! Please, do not USE this product!! This product will break and damage your hair with continued use. SLS is not good for any hair type. Say NO to SLS!"
5,Outstanding,"I received F.A.S.T. in a very timely manner and the product is great. I use it all the time. It does what it says. I started using the shampoo and conditioner approximately 3 years ago. At that time my hair was @ my shoulders. Now my it is at my waist. I receive compliments all the time about how healthy, shiny and long it is."
5,Unexpected!,"First I have to say that all beauty items are subjective. Please use at your own cautions.Ok got that disclaimer out of the way and I'm really to rave about this! I'm Asian and was not ""blessed"" with the typical straight and silky hair. I have somewhat coarse, wavy, and thick hair. The hair does not even grow half an inch per month. Due to my sleeping habits, I know it's me to blame. But the strange thing is, my nails and other bodily hair grows at a supersonic speed. Anyways, after using this for a month... My hair grew an inch!! I used this every other day and sometimes don't even get to the conditioner. Neither the shampoo or conditioner made my hair dry. I also like to believe that I lose less hair in the showers. Onward towards my hair goal~"
3,It's ok.,It's a nice shampoo but it doesn't really seem to make your hair grow any faster than normal. By the way my parents are Jamaican and Indian (from India Indian not native american) so my hair is very fine.
3,Not what I expected but not bad either,"So, let me just begin by saying that if you want to use this for hair growth, don't waste your time. I have been using this product for about 4 months now and I haven't noticed any hair growth that was faster than usual. I was disappointed with this product but not completely. I will say that unlike some of the other reviews where people said the product dried out their hair it did the complete opposite for me. In fact, my hair felt so silky smooth after I used it. I also think the over all health of my hair improved a little, but there wasn't a huge difference. So it is great for washing your hair but I could spend 5 dollars on a cheaper product and see the same result.In conclusion, the product didn't really work for me. So I guess I will keep doing cardio and taking biotin for somewhat faster hair growth."
2,Vinyl is not for me,"The product may be fine for what it is but it's not for me. The vinyl doesn't breathe so even with a sheet over it crinks and has an uncomfortable hard feeling to it. And it makes me sweat and stick to the sheet because there is no breathing of the material beneath the bedsheet. Body heat can only go one way - up back on to you. I bought the 3 gauge and it tore up pretty badly when I removed the mattress from the bed after a few months, and before that the top tore a little bit from tossing and turning in the night. I was not happy with this purchase at all. The seller was quite nice, though and the delivery was prompt and easy."
1,this book is fine,"oh i wanted to LOVE this book-- it is FINE--but not amazing-- a bit too ""textbook""--"
4,Canon Digital Camera,The camera is great. It is an expanded version of the PowerShot 400.The add on accessories kit was not worth it. The tripod is good but the lenses don't make much difference in what can be photographed. The carrying case is huge and does not fit the camera. My complaint about the carrying case was not honored by 42nd Street Electronics but Amazon was gracious enough to give me a refund on the kit.Canon PowerShot SD800 IS 7.1 Megapixel Digital Camera + Lenses + 1GB Pro Accessory Kit
1,Waste of money.,"Misleading movie description, don't get excited, this movie hardly deserves to be rated R. Lame"
4,"Fun, Campy, Bluesy, and, well, Cher","This album was an inspired ""comeback"" for Cher when it was originally released by Casablanca in the late 70's. The title song was a major hit, and has aged better than expected. The rest of the album is a grab bag of styles -- from the bluesy ""Guitar Groupie"" to the country ""It's Too Late to Love Me Know"". Other highlights include the very personal ""My Song (Too Far Gone)"" and the hard-to-listen-with-a-straight-face ""Wasn't It Good"". If only the company who re-released this hadn't added two earlier Cher songs (""You Better Sit Down Kids"" and ""Bang Bang"") -- good songs, but they don't really fit with the rest of this album. And one added delight: the original cover artwork -- campy, strange, cool. The ""Casablanca Years"" album contains all the original songs from ""Take Me Home"" plus all the songs from ""Prisoner"", so that is actually a better buy, but if you want the original artwork, this is the one."
5,a review from mango,this was my first michener novel. it was excellent.you really feel the mood in this novel. a must read for all michener fans.
5,Really Groovey,This book was amazing. It kept me up all night for three days reading. If you are looking for something to get motivated this is the book for you!
4,Restless youth - still applicable?,"I read this book 17 years ago (I was 20 at the time) and I felt it described youth very well. However, at times I felt he was trying too hard to understand the tensions brought about at this age. Anyway, he really gave me something at that time, I only wish young people now were aware of it. As an English teacher in a Norwegian high school, I do my best to promote it to my pupils, and those who read genuinely appreciate it. I think its values apply even more to the young people of today. Please e-mail me if you agree/disagree."
2,A huge yawn,"I am perplexed by the rave reviews this book is getting on this web site (with a couple of exceptions). I find this book a tremendous bore. It's wordy beyond belief, and its central character is a boring old man who, for some unknown reason, has captured the affections of a bunch of anti-establishment teenagers. The improbable nature of the plot (that the narrator already knows half of the teenagers before catching up with them in Spain) detracts from the message of the narrative, though some of the individual experiences were no doubt true to the time in which the novel is set. I'm about halfway through it and I can't bear to read another word."
3,"Though appearance of item is not as pictured, it works fine-package was late",Product has green button rather than holiday appropriate red and green. Package was late and missed being here in time for Christmas.
1,this doesn't work,This cord is dead - it doesn't work at all. It's not just the on/off switch that doesn't work -- it just doesn't work.
5,brought my christmas spirit back,I use this to turn my tree on and off and well it does that and it is green wich is a plus.
4,Good Summary of Toyota Culture,This book brings it all together under 14 principles. It is a good book for those who would like to learn about Toyota's success.
1,Book sent with missing pages,I received the book about 2 months ago and just started reading it. To my amazement I found chapters 1 and 2 ripped out of the book.I would suggest carefully looking over used books bought from this site.
5,"A ""Must"" for manufacturers",There's nothing else to say when Toyota is recommending this book in their NA website.
1,Disappointing DVD - image quality,"The box touts ""Digitally Mastered"", well it's not like you have the choice when converting from an analog video tape to a DVD, because that's obviously what's been done.They simply put together images from 20 year old footage. The image quality is mediocre at best, faded, yellowed and contrastless. You can actually see black spots and scratches on the image just like you would see on old B&W; movies.This is really a DVD put together on the cheap: the ""Bonus Slideshow does not even work."
4,This record was just the start,"This one was just a taste what to get ready for on Step by step! I LOVE NKOTB!!! They are the original BSB & NSYNC! on this tape my fave is ""i need you"" & ""hold on"""
4,Cheesy 80s Fun!,"I originally got this album back in '88 and I got on CD a month ago. I LOVED them when I was in fourth/fifth grade(back in '89. Showing my age! ), though I wasn't the type to yell and scream at the sight of them(I went to a concert back in Nov 19, 1989 and I just sat there, absorbing the excitement at being at my very first concert, probably my last). My cousin used to be a BIG fan, ESPECIALLY Joe. She had all their performances on tape and every picture of them. She got rid of them, but my other cousin was nicer and gave me her old pinups and I still have them tucked away in a folder.Enough of my memories. I love all the songs, for the exception of ""Hangin' Tough"", with those fart-sounding noises made after the line ""Cause you know it ain't over till the fat lady sings"", which is why it is four stars instead of five. Other than that, it is a GREAT album to listen to if you want to go back to the days of innocence and carefree-ness."
1,"Spice Girls of the 80's, marketed ,no talent","The 80's are OVER and so are the new kids.As far as the comment of the CRAZY chick, anyone can get a solo contract with the right connections or we wouldn't have people like Jennifer Love Hewitt or Eric Estrada recording stuff for crazy fans."
2,bouncing hurt knee,I researched this product and was very excited when it arrived. I found I love to bounce. I watched the video and read the material. I believed I could cellercise and not hurt myself. I was wrong! I followed David's routine with him on the video and injured my knee. It has been about 2 months and my knee is still not good. I called the company for advise and no response. I
5,Facing the Giants,"""Facing the Giants"" is powerful and inspiring for all ages. We have been encouraging everyone we know to watch it."
5,Movie,"I did like it a lot, congratulations guys you are the best! I truly recommend this movie here.Facing The Giants, it's a Christina Movie that I recommend for your to see, and you should have it."
4,Facing The Giants,An excellent movie that brings the excitement of football and the seriousness of Fatherhood to an excellent blend of a good story.
2,Missing Something,"I had heard this was an inspiring story, but the acting and dialogue were so boring that I couldn't get through it. And I am always looking for good stories for my kids -- but this just lacked the ability to keep my attention."
4,awesome flick,"I really give it 4 1/2 stars. I watched this movie when I was feeling down and lifted my spirits. Great message about staying focused on God when life is very difficult. Some people that reviewed this movie said that the acting wasn't that great, but I think the actors did a real good job. I bought the movie the day after I rented it. I highly recommend it."
5,"GREAT MESSAGE,GREAT MOVIE.UH.....HELLO??","You know,i was never a fan of football movies.For example,for those of you who saw walt disney's INVINCIBLE,you might have thought it was good.To me it had no plot.But this movie,this one was a true work of art!Not only does it have the best message possible to get(nothing's impossible with God)but it had aout 10x as much football action that INVINSIBLE!A good movie that really puts a smile on your face throughout the whole entire movie.plus,there were alot of funny sequences in this movie as well.I pretty much have a dislike of football movies-this one got #3 on my top 10 best movies ever list!So if you love football movies,see this movie.If you don't,still see this movie.Besides,it has a message that EVERYONE needs to hear.So get out there,and buy this movie on dvd.You won't be disappointed with this one,trust a honest reviewer."
5,Awesome Movie! Good story-line & meaning,"Even if you hate football, you will love this movie. Great movie for the whole family."
1,Warning! This is not a sports drama!,"I felt very mislead into believing that this was a sports drama movie. Has a very misleading cover and a misleading description. There is no ""action packed drama"" and I saw nothing that could be award wining. Very unrealistic since church and state are separate. Should come with a warning that states ""extreme religious overtones with bad acting and bad directing"". This movie is a religious force it down your throat movie. If you want to see a movie about how the belief in religion can control ones life, well then this is the one to see. I saw nothing inspirational nor uplifting in this film. Oh yeah if a man can not have children for medical reasons and his wife gets pregnant, then she cheated on him and its not a ""miracle""."
5,facing gaints,"i cryed when i watched this movie facing gaints, i plane to take it to church so we can watch it at movie night thank you."
4,VERY ENCOURAGING,This movie is great!!!!!! It is obvious that the actors are not professionals but the message of the movie more than makes up for that. I would highly recommend this movie for anyone but especially those who need to know that God still cares for them and that if you put your trust in him He is always working things out for our behalf even if it takes a miracle. It made everyone cry!
5,Put this on your Must See Before I Die list,"Oh wow. I knew there had to be something special about this movie when my sister, who always knows just what to get someone, sent a FOOTBALL movie to our Mom for Mother's Day. I put off watching it for a couple weeks. I don't care for football, but I've heard great reviews. OH WOW. I don't cry over many things, but I don't even remember how many times this movie made me just want to pause and bawl my eyes out. I am facing giants in my own life, as everyone does at times. You need to watch this and see what a little hope will do. Just when the thoughts of giving up or suicide hit, that's the time things will start to look up if you only give the Lord the chance He's waiting on."
5,Facing the Giants,This was a good movie. The packaging was intact and it was shipped in a timely manor with no damage to the packaging or product...
5,Facing the Giants: Life-Changing,"This movie is so important, I've sent one to each of my five (grown) children, and recommended it to everyone I know. The message is one that will stay with you; you'll be reminded of this movie for a long time after seeing it. I expected something syrup-y, but it was not. After a few minutes of watching it, I got the idea that it was going to be predictable and trite, but it was not. If you have ever struggled with the questions of the meaning of life or how to live life in such a way that it HAS meaning, THIS is the movie to see. By the way, you don't have to have any interest in football or sports to enjoy this."
5,Christian Inspirational,"While this does not have box office movie stars, the story moved us alternately between cheers and tears (good). We highly recommend this story of what happens when you allow God to be in control and not man! We have now watched it several times and it still has the same power!"
5,Facing the Giants,in life there are sometimes hard lessons to be learned and in Facing the Giants we got it.don't hate
3,Way too much information for a young girl,I bought this book with the intention of giving it to a girl who just turned 12. Both her mother and I agreed it was way to much information and the illustrations were too graphic for a 12 year-old. The intent of the book is commendable but some parents may take issue with the author's opinions on the subjects covered. It might be better for an older girl but parents/relatives should read the book carefully before handing it over to even a young teenager.
2,More informative than I thought it would be,"I bought this book for my 10 year old to start a conversation about the birds and the bees and her body. This book covered everything from male genetalia to STD in a way that I do not think my 10 year old was ready for. I read it before I let her see it and decided that we would try to find another more age appropriate book. In my opinion this book is for a teen, definitely not a pre-teen. It has lots of good information, just not the information I needed for my child right now."
1,Totally inappropriate for a per-pubescent!,"The book's attempt to cover all of human sexuality is also it's pitfall. It cannot cover the information both a 9-year old and a 15-year old need to digest.My original review of this book was rejected by Amazon, probably because I used the book's own explicit words for the graphic details of sexual stimulation and activities. Yes, the language and visuals are by far more than a child needs to learn all at once.I cannot imagine what the author and the publisher were thinking when they released this book. Beware."
4,Book number 2,I chose this book for my granddaughter. It has just been mailed to her mom for approvel. I'm sure it will answer somequestions a 14 yr. old may be embarressed to ask a parent. I want her mom to inspect it first though. I believe she will find it a good book. A couple of years ago I bought the same type of book for my two grandsons. I thought it explained about the body and the changes in the body very well. I was happy with this book and I would recommend it to anyone with young teens.
3,Extras please!,"If you loved the show of course you will love the DVD set. Unfortunately, if you expect any extras you will be disappointed, as there are none. I would love to see extras such as bloopers and outtakes from this show. Overall, this is definitely a TV show box set on the cheap. So, if you can get the set on the cheap go for it. Otherwise, wait for the reruns to return on TV Land."
