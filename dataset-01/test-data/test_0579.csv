4,Great teether,"This is a great teether, my only compliant is that it's a little too big for our 4 month hold to grab a hold of... but a good buy just the same, he loves it!"
2,Too big,I bought this for my teething 6-month old. She had trouble putting it into her mouth. It seems to be too big to be a teething ring for her.
3,Very little scandal,"If you do not expect too much then this can be a fun movie. It runs along the lines of ""A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court"". Eddie Cantor wakes up in Roman times and has a number of adventures.You have to take in account the age of this movie and decide if the comedy of this era appeals to you or not. I like Laurel & Hardy, Abbott & Costello and though this was not as funny, it was enjoyable."
4,12 ANGRY STEPS - one typo from fame!!,"this was the first indie release from one raging DETROIT band, 12ANGRYSTEPS, which as you can see has been listed incorrectly by our friends @ AMAZON (the real title is in the photo). these guys could put one heckuva show. this disc was produced by mr. Jim Diamond (of the Dirtbombs),producer of none other than Detroit's own White Stripes (who actually opened for these guys in 1999). anyhow, this is more representative of the DETROIT STUFF YOU'LL NEVER SEE IN ROLLING STONE. it's proof that real music dosen't fit so easily into one category. oh yeah, it's also uncensored, so if your easily offended, you will be. rumor has it a couple of these fine lads were arrested shortly after the band's demise-- give the album a listen and find out why!!"
5,Ford Windstar Motor Mount,"Ford wanted $185.00 for their motor mount which is liquid filled and failed after 170k miles. Our mechanic said we might feel a little more vibration because this one is solid and not liquid. We had it installed and it works fine! Also, the total price for labor and this mount was less than the price of the stock one alone!!"
1,the abyss,"This was the worst sports game ive ever played.I can deal with sub-par graphics.I can deal with the fact that the plays are hard to see.But i couldnt take poor controls, the inability to save your game (not all of us are able to spend hours playing games) and the stupid create-a-player ""feature"",although ive never liked the unlimited attributes you can give in the pc version-kind of takes the fun out of it.i always like NHL 95 because you were limited to an over all total to give your created players.anyways if you must buy this game,buy it used then you wont be as upset when you find out how lame this is."
1,Play Madden '92,"This game is garbage, I made a huge mistake of purchasing this product. I have been playing Madden since '92 and these graphics are worse than the old ones. Running the ball is vitually impossible and the WR's are hard to see weather they are open or not. The play control lacks in all spectrums of playability. It just felt like playing in a box with no air. Stick with PS2, X-Box and Gamecube versions. I hope EA puts more effort into producing a good hand held product for it's 2005 release."
1,Should be considered a torture device,"This headset is SO UNCOMFORTABLE that I can't wear them for more than 5 minutes. Come on, who makes square ear pads?? Plus, the inside of each ear pad has solid, hard plastic that presses against your ears. Sure, the microphone works great but the only thing you'll be able to record are the sounds of your screams from the shear discomfort of wearing these.Avoid at all costs!"
4,Best book in trilogy.,"I found the first and last books in the Dark Matters trilogy more amusing than the second. I feel that Christie Golden goes into too much detail with the Ailaan and the Culiann and that more depth should have been given to the Entity, Kes. Overall it was a great book ,and I enjoyed reading about the Tal'Shiar and Jerki Kaleh."
4,These work well,"If you think your coffee isn't tasting as good as it should, buy some new filters - what a difference they make."
1,These don't work,"I bought this a while back as replacements for my Mr coffee. Machine. and they don't slow the water down enough. They allow the water to go into the basket quicker than it is let out at the bottom so it overflows and the coffee and the grounds go everywhere, I've had to wrap it in a paper towel to add additional filtration or set another one on top of the basket in order to prevent this. It has made many messes and everyone that comes to my house tries to buy me a coffee maker that works."
2,Mr Coffee filters,The water doesn't distribute evenly over the coffee so the coffee grinds do not get evenly covered with water and you get weak coffee.
5,Great!,This are the filters I've used for years. Well worth the money. Great for anybody's budget. Got them pretty fast too!
5,Covers all the bases!,"This video was ordered for supplementary information. It covers all the bases in a very professional way. Techniques are presented well and in a very understandable way.I highly recommend this DVD as live classes are difficult to find and even harder to participate in due to BYOB requirements.Sincerely,GKP"
2,Nothing impressive.....,It's fine. I'll show you some stuff on how to do a massage. Keep your money - rub your hands around your partner a bit. I'm sure he'll/she'll like it.
2,Misleading marketing,I was rather disappointed in this book. Feel that the marketing is misleading at best. Not worth the money.
2,Not very useful,"Apart from some good general points there was no useful information in this book.For example: vegetable juice would be good but how to make the stuff is not mentioned. A four day rotation diet is suggested, but what on earth you should be eating the 4 mornings after the 1 day of 'bread for breakfast' - no clue.There also were a few things that bothered me - the author observes some effect in a handful of people (often only 1) and then draws general conclusions from that. To me this is scientifically flawed. She also seems to be suggesting thyroid medication for pretty much every condition (but NEVER mentions getting tested for thyroid antibody levels once your TSH/T4/T3 levels are off).In short ""eat healthy stuff and things will somehow balance themselves"" seems to be the message, which I know to be not true."
2,Not very useful,"The author spends at least 80% of the book on specific afflictions which will make most of this book irrelevant to most readers. Very little information provided anywhere about the alkaline diet--more about ""grain eating"" vs. ""meat eating"" metabolisms and other unrelated material. Methinks the publisher named this book to sell more books, irregardless of the contents.If you want a better idea about the tenants of the alkaline diet, including the pH effects of certain foods see books by Brown and Young."
1,The Acid Alkaline Balance Diet,The title was very deceiving. It said it was a balance diet. It went into lengthy details of what was acid and what was alkaline. There were no actual lists of foods to avoid or to consume for health. I feel I wasted money on this book.
2,Was rather disappointed,"Although I'm not a professional, I have read extensively in the area of health, nutrition, molecular biology, etc. If I am to believe the bulk of material written by researchers & scientists, doctors and naturopathic professionals, then I'd have to say that there is a fair amount of misinformation and not-quite-right ""facts"" presented in this book. After having read about a quarter of the book, I had come across so many items that don't quite agree with the latest generally accepted knowledge that I lost heart for finishing the book. While the overall presentation is basically valid and the lifestyle recommendations are good, I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who doesn't have the knowledge to sort out or at least question and verify which information is valid and what should be ignored."
4,tcm movie pack,i havent had time to watch them but have seen the movies already and they are wonderful. it was a good purchase.
4,Great Classic Christmas Movies,It is hard to beat the old classic Christmas movies. These movies have great actors and wonderful stories. A good value for the price.
5,A great collection!,I love getting film collections. I've enjoyed all the movies in this colllection. Usually there is at least one that's kind of blah but all four of these were really good and I look forward to watching them again next Christmas.
3,Greatest Classic Christmas Films,"Good quality DVD's. You'll enjoy these if you're into the Classic movies. Enjoyable entertainment at Christmas time, esp. on days when all you want to do is sit in front of the T.V., relax and get into the whole Christmas spirit."
4,This is what DS is for...,"Mario, DK, stylus action... Which adds up to a nearly-casual game for all. Move the Marios (yes plural) so that they can reach the doors in every level. Beware of the obstacles on the way. When a whole Mario world is finished (8 in total), you unlock a mini game. Again, when you finish a world you face the mighty Donkey Kong in a boss game. Beat him and you are onto the next game.Fun to play, a little bit of easy to beat, but hey, this is either for -18 or +30. Good game..."
4,TIME TO $H!MMER$H1NE,"I think this a really well written story.It is very moving and emotional.This book contains lots of slang, so it was very easy to fallow along.This book is about a girl named Angie.She dreams of going big and buying her mom a big house. Until the day she meets her Cousin Seatta. She tells her to achive her dreams by telling herabout her african beauty, her heritage of slaves, on top of all the shimmershine feeling. Do you really want to figure out what happens next go ahead and read it!!!!"

3,50/50,"This is the first book that I have read by Ron Rash so I have nothing to compare it to with his style of writing. With that said, I liked it. I didn't love it. I thought the subject was interesting with lots of potential. I can't put my finger on it exactly, but I found it lacking. The characters were a slightly unlikable and maybe a bit under developed and I found myself wanting more from them. In fact the whole book could have used about another 100 pages to dive into the plot a little deeper.With all that said it was an easy read, finished it in 2 days. Overall, I give this one a C."
5,Love these tables!,We have two of these tables and use them all the time. They are exactly what I was looking for. Sturdy enough but light enough to move around easily. Easy to put together - tool was included.
1,Cheap and Overpriced,"The wood portion of this item is OK (scratched on the edge). The rest of this product is steel tubing that has several breaks and requires too many screws for such a simple design. These breaks in the tubing make the product look cheap. Two welds have slag left over on the metal from poor welding. Metal finish is marred with light scratches. The table is uneven once assembled, but compensates with screw in feet that can be backed off to ""level"" the table. These feet cheap. Functionally, it is OK and serves its purpose. But, I think it is an over priced cheap piece of junk. Made in USA with excellent Chinese craftsmanship."
2,"Weak, weak, weak.","I'm a voracious though discriminating reader of military fiction. Sadly, my first foray into this author's work left me cold. The plots are thin, and never really come together to make a cohesive novel. The main characters are thin, almost two-dimensional stereotypes of Navy Seals, Intel officers, and FSO's. And even if you can ignore the fact that the battle scenes have the Seals expending about 400 pounds of ammo apiece, it's still incredible that such pros could fight so foolishly and survive so well. This book gets two stars instead of zero or one because the author writes intelligent sentences; they just don't combine for much of a tale."
2,Failed to meet it's potential,"Had high hopes for this product. Few parts, All in one design, rechargeable, even a simple recharger/stand made for high hopes. Unfortunately, I was quickly disappointed. Trying to cut hair with this is frustrating. The clip continually collects your hair, requiring you to remove it and tap it to try to get the hair out. A normal 15min buzz took 30min+.Thought I had finally found the perfect clippers but will sadly be returning them asap."
5,Amazing,"This is the best trimmer in the world! I am a girl and I use it frecuently to do my fashion hair cuts and my boyfriend use it too... it is quiet, precisely, even if you want to shave you body you can use it or your face! you will get the best machine and you can clean it with water, it is wireless! i really recommend this product"
2,Disappointed,"I purchased this bearm trimmer for utilizing on a frequent basis. I had no problem with the overall quality of the item. What I had issue with was the trimmer did not trim the hair as closely as stipulated. I like to keep a very close trim, it leaves the hair quite prickly, not as short as the Wahl I presently own and was replacing. I returned the Panasonic, now am seeking another brand."
4,Easy to use and did a nice job,I really liked the product. It was easy to use and lived up to billing. It does not have multiple size grooming heads which are always an annoyance. The single adjustable head on the razor works well.The only small issue is that the design makes it a little difficult to get to the hair immediately next to the nose. This is a small annoyance and I would recommend this device without a doubt.
5,GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD,It works great for cutting hair and beards. It charges fast and works great on hair. No more barber for me.
1,"bad design, broke","The design of the plastic guard creates weak spots where the material is thin. It broke. Not good. Looking at it after it broke, the bad design becomes very obvious."
2,Broke in same spot as in picture,I had this trimmer for approximately 8 months and it broke at the same point indicated in the picture. The battery life was also waning towards the end of it's life. I use this to shave my head so perhaps it wasn't designed to last anymore than a few minutes but I am once again in the market for a beard/hair trimmer. I was going to buy the plastic piece as a replacement part but hard troubles locating....
3,"Hopefully, this is model is due for revisions...","I was attracted by the design concept; turn the dial and change the cut depth. This negates the 8 different guards clattering around a drawer or basket. Two trips to the Barber Shop, and it pays off. It's great for thinning-hair guys who trim everything in 5 minutes with minimal tapering.The model I tried was a flop; the guard comb split apart almost a month into use, by falling onto the bathroom counter. Gluing it back bought me another two months; customer service was non-existent. Panasonic/National makes GREAT shavers, with high RPM motors and sharp blades, but they fell down here, big time. I hope the make some improvements to the guard, making it from a more flexible HDPE."
4,Very good but not perfect,"I really enjoy using this trimmmer, but I do have one bit of advice for potenitial purchasers. Before using, you must check that the face guard is in the proper position for the desired setting. It does tend to fluctuate on mine, and does not always line up properly when replacing after cleaning. Last week's setting #2 might line up to this week's setting #5 if you are not carefull when replacing the face guard. Other than that, no other complaints and no other problems."
1,"Great, while it worked","I absolutely loved this shaver, until it broke. As has happened to others, the guard broke within 6 months of first use. In my case, the guard split at the bottom through the thickest part of the guide. I was extra careful with the unit based on other revieww: no drops, no abuse, no forcing things, just a weekly trimming of my beard for 6 months. Dang."
4,great for its price!!!,"This was a gift for my dad and he is absolutely satisfied with it. Good price, good battery, great precision = good buy"
2,Heads Break Easily,Very difficult to get replacement heads for this device and they break often. I would look for an alternative product. re Panasonic ER 224S
4,I bought another one - still hate the charger,"I bought the ER224S and liked it so much I bought another for my cats (for the long haired one mainly). If you tend to break fragile things, perhaps this one is not for you, as the removable guide seems quite thin. The run time seems to be about a month, when using it once or twice a week. The charger station is the worst I have ever seen, I have to recharge it in the front room cause it doesn't fit in the bathroom socket with the medicine cabinet above it. Very bad design on the recharger, good thing it lasts so long or I would have chucked it by now. And the kitty is not afraid of it, in fact she loves it now, cause those knots hurt.I would recommend this product."
2,Not that great,"I've used this trimmer only twice, but my initial opinion will lead me to return it. When trimming my moustache, it's nearly impossible to get the areas close under the nose.I used it to cut my sons hair, but it kept binding up and pulling his hair. I ultimately gave up and returned to the old Oster clippers I have. They buzzed right through with no problem.I'll be sending this item back."
4,A welcome reissue on the Nonesuch label!,"A juicy, expanded 2-CD reissue of Baobab's legendary 1982 album. Gorgeous West African pop, with a heavy emphasis on the style's deep Afro-Cuban roots. Recommended, although I agree that this doesn't have the same lush, hypnotic qualities of their other albums.. The emphasis here is more on dance rhythms than on pretty guitar riffs."
3,Disappointed!,"I am a little disappointed with this toy, which I bought for my 3 year old. She loves playing with the shapes. However, the pieces did not stick well to the black cardboard at all. I saw this in another review so perhaps I will call the manufacturer. The spiral bound book also fell apart literally on the first use. I am surprised it was not better constructed."
5,Great Show,"I love watching this show. I wish there where more shows on TV now a days like Full House. The only thing I have a problem with isn't the show, it's the cases the dvd's come in. For some reason when I open one of the cases one of the dvd's always comes loose from the holder. I wish they would of stuck with the original cases they first came out with, I had no problem with them. But anyways, great show, great season."
2,Movie's Most Popular Song Deleted,"I first saw Westward Ho! The Wagons in a theatre when it first came out. In it was a song called Wringle Wrangle, sung by Fess Parker. I bought the video mainly so I could hear this song. Guess what? The song was not there! For some reason it has been deleted from the video. The video must have been made from a television print which was edited to fit the time slot of the Disneyland TV show. It even has fadeouts that seem to have been put there so commercials could be inserted. I was very disappointed. I always thought Disney videos were complete. The theatrical print was in CinemaScope. I hope they will release a DVD in widescreen format (2.35:1) that is complete."
5,An Excellent Narrative History,"J.R. Edmondson's ""The Alamo Story"" eclipses Walter Lord's groundbreaking ""A Time to Stand"" as the finest narrative history of the Alamo available.Written in an engaging, highly accessible style, Edmondson's book is a first rate introduction to Alamo history, but provides enough detail to capture the interest of even the most knowledgable Alamo scholar.Highly recommended."
1,Like looking through someone else's photo album.,Wanders aimlessly from subject to subject.Could not establish affection for any of the characters.
3,"Not a review, but a clarification.","Please note that this book is the Solution Manual for Hoy, et al's ""Mathematics for Economics"" and is *NOT* the solution manual for Pemberton's ""Mathematics for Economists."" Amazon's listing of these two together in their respective ""Better Together"" sections made me think that these books went together, at least initially.Note the difference here: ""Economics"" vs. ""Economists"" in the titles of the books. Don't buy a solution manual for a book you don't have!"
1,Very bad accurace! Huge disappointment!!!!!!,"I have purchase this product few months ago for my parents. They have high blood pressure problem.We checked the product online and trust the product description. But when we start to use it, we found that the measured values are so much diffrent than actual pressure. We follow each and every step stated to get the accurate result, but for some reason this product fails to give correct readings.This may create serious problem because my mother got very high blood pressure even if this machine shows below normal. Do not compromise with your health!"
4,I got hooked on the story by Stackpole's podcast,"I discovered this book via the author's podcast, which comes out one chapter per week. Once I was hooked on the story, I naturally couldn't wait to find out what would happen next.I definitely recommend the prequel: The Dark Glory War IThe Dark Glory War (A Prelude to the DragonCrown War Cycle)If you like adventure and lots of action, you will like this book."
4,Sophisticated Sugar,"Bought these cane cubes for those times when a good tea or coffee needs a little extra touch.They have exceeded my expectations - the only down note (and I am being extremely picky here) is that kind of flat taste at the end of a sip (sort of a faintly grassy taste) that all cane sugar has - for me anyway. YMMV of course.Other than that it is excellent. Much, much better than the highly processed white stuff we usually see in the States. With a good tea in particular it shines. It doesn't overwhelm the tea like the processed stuff can, it just floats among the flavors of a good Darjeeling or Oolong (or whatever tea you happen to like!)Four-and-a-half stars. The Riffy seal of approval is granted heretofore!"
3,Kinetic,"Kinski was a bizarre guy...he really seemed to have a mix of wonderully generous qualities, with a lot of (maybe more) absolutely horrendous qualities. (As the review below says, the original version of this book, ALL I NEED IS LOVE, has Kinski hinting that he slept with his own daughter, Nasstasja, which is about as horrendous as you can get. He did sleep with his sister, as he relates in here, so he wasn't a stranger to incest.) It's definitely a unique biography...a lot of explicit sex. A lot. And, like any pornography, it, after the initial shock, wears thin and gets monotonous. The writing is hyperactive and explosive, and is definitely a result of Kinski's worship of Dostoevsky, the most hyperactive writer of them all. (Kinski named Nasstasja after a character in Dostoevsky's novel THE IDIOT, and was involved with trying to get a stage version of CRIME AND PUNISHMENT in production). He's no Dostoevsky, but Kinski's book does keep your attention a lot of the time."
1,A dull screed.,"Basically like letting someone rant at you endlessly, and much of what's being said isn't even true. Kinski goes off on alleged sexual conquests and flights of sheer hatred. Such a thing might be rendered amusing, but Kinski doesn't have writer in him enough to pull it off."
3,Real but Raunchy,"You need to be a true Klaus Kinski fan to get past his vulgar descriptions of all his sexual experiences, but you do get a real insight into what makes Klaus tick. Despite his wanting to NOT be the stereotypical ""hard to work with actor,"" HE WAS! Moody, and very hard to work with, it's amazing he got work at all. Despite, his simplistic and often smutty writing style, it's worth the read, just to get into the mind of the actor-Kinski..."
4,Code Lyoko: The Cini-Manga Review,"This is a good book for any Code Lyoko fan to have on their shelf. The pictures are mostly screen-shots, not drawn, but it definatly is a good pick!"
5,MonoPoky,"This is a very nice addition to the Monopoly family. We had lots of fun with it, but only after we decided NOT to play the doubles special: the double six makes it possible to steal another player's pokemon and was a BIG source of trouble. Kids love it and the little pokemon movers are very cute. Great buy!"
5,Hit of the neighborhood,"For my little brother's birthday, I got him the Pokemon monopoly game and he hasn't put it down since! He's the hit of the neigborhood because none of the kids have Pokemon in the monopoly form. Not only are the kids playing something they like, they are learning a great deal on how to do business! Most of the kids are now asking for the game for Christmas. I got lucky and bought mine in early November! I recommend this game to all Pokemon lovers!"
4,Does the job.,"Just got my husky cargo liner 26251 for my 07 pathfinder. I had assumed that the liner would be a 100% fit of the cargo area but realistically it's more like a 90-95% fit. The mat isn't quite as thick and heavy as I expected it to be but it certainly performs it's job. I'm happy with the product because I think it will do everything I need it to (contain dirt, water, spills, and to protect the flooring). I feel like the price is fair for the product. I give it 4 stars for being a good product that will do what it says. I would've given it a 5-star rating if it really impressed me with the fit and materials. I would recommend this product to a friend."
5,"If its a fake, It's a frickin' good one.","Everything looks great. CD, case, booklet, even that silly paper thing that comes on the spine. Sounds good too. (Not a fan of the Tetsu era tho')"
4,Simple Spiritual Techniques,"This CD has some techniques discussed by Tolle to perceive inner space. They require some repeated practice for those not familiar with meditation, but seem to work fine. The music is a minor distraction."
2,Be careful - they don't work on all pots,"Just bought a set of these to replace a missing knob on a Tele. I was surprised to find that these knobs don't use screws to secure to the pot shaft - they have a plastic thing inside. One fit fine on the tone pot, which was a split shaft, but I had replaced the volume pot with a DiMarzio with a solid shaft pot - and the knob would't fit over it for love or money. The plastic was too hard to stretch over the shaft.Also, they seem really cheap, with some sort of chrome plate that is sure to wear off fast."
4,Nice mugs for the price,"These mugs are huge and have a nice, hefty feel (but not so heavy that make them hard to hold). I'm certain that I'll be using them for soup when it gets a little cooler. The mugs are a nice complement to myHamilton Beach 43253 Ensemble 12-Cup Coffeemaker, Red"
2,If I saw it in a bookstore it would have stayed there,"If you're looking to study a fashion photographer look elsewhere (unless your idea of fashion is naked women with sand all over them). Most of the work is run of the mill beach work, not much to get excited about (unless you take it to the bathroom)."
2,Almost as Disappointing as the movie...,"This game is fun for the first five hours, but the satisfaction of smashing things declines quickly after that. I recommend renting it or borrowing it from a friend before you decide to buy."
2,"Chalk one up for the ""Movie to Game gone BAD""...","Okay,let's get straight to the point:The Hulk is a great comic book! There has been an attempt to make a video game on the Hulk but it sucked eggs BIG TIME ! This is a BIG improvement but suffers a lot from repetetiveness. The only fun parts are when you fight bosses who are super villains and the military.Being Bruce Banner is just a drag. All you can do is crouch and roll(aside from punching).It's impossible to be stealthy! I got through the game with an invicibility cheat ( Thank God!).The game is also way Too short!The upside to this game is that the graphics are pretty good ( especially the cinematics )and there is good voice acting. The environments are destructible but not fully destructible.Rent this game with another game to check for yourself but you'll find it pretty disapointing...by Jonathan Oliver ,a.k.a., the Hellspawn"
4,Atrus the Dunderhead?,"A good book. But I felt a grave dissapointment in Atrus. Atrus is a hard-edged ""scientist"". He proves this in the first book of the trilogy. But let's face facts. If you find an age that is Utopia, would you not ask why the food magically appears? Who milks the cows? Atrus gives the very strong impression of being the worst thing possible. A, well, ""liberal Democrat"". I'll stick with Veovis and Gehn. Even Catherine knew that something was amiss when they entered this age. At least at first. Atrus seemed to become ""whacked out"" with luxury and humanitarianism. Nevertheless, this is a good end to the trilogy. Oh! And Atrus certainly should have deeply questioned that old man who wanted the book burned immediately. But he probably didn't want to hurt his feelings! (sarcasm)."
5,Drops you into a world of immense intrigue.,"When I finally got down to reading these books, I literally could not put them down. Each one, especially the book of D'NI, was fun to read because of their... ""realness."" I also liked them because of the pictures they placed in your mind. Just as if you were actually there. Truly a great series. I recomend this book(and it's prequels)to all people. Thanks Rand Miller and everyone else who helped to create these great reads."
2,"Long on Emotion, Light on Info","Buyer beware. If you are looking for a fact filled book about the Southwest Indian tribes, you won't find much here. What you will get is a book-long very emotional screed decrying the terrible impact that Caucasians have had on the native tribes of the Americas. Not that that's incorrect-it isn't-but the author's somewhat overwrought descriptive of the tribes and their struggles at the time of the author's writing can be a bit much."
4,great budget guide for a beautiful vacation,"helped us find the best (and no so expensive) sites on oahu and kauaii. generally very good restaurant/food recommendations, though sometimes a little off on the beaches. i would recommend this to anyone travelling to hawaii on a budget."
1,TOY UNSAFE!!!!!,I don't know what any of these reviewers are talking about.THIS TOY IS UNSAFE for a one-year-old. My 15-month-old daughter constantly tipped and fell off this USELESS toy. A simple safety strap would make it usable- why after all the bells and whistles did they not think of this simple SAFETY feature?DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!
5,Simply Brilliant,"This story is brilliant. At first I was a little reluctant about it, but by the end I was in love. I really liked the animation and the story. You have the chance to get to know the characters, and get familiarize with their thinking. At the end I kept thinking I want to know more. But you have to see it to understand why I say this. Nevertheless is a very good experience."
4,Very awesome dvd,"the DVD was well protected. It is a great watch. The thing about the DVD case however was kinda of disappointing. The case itself was a little flimsy, it just felt like it was a cheap plastic case. Other than that it is a great DVD."
3,My eleven year old granddaughter said it was boring.,"I did not see the video but think that if my granddaughter reviews it again - maybe in another year - she'll like it more. However, she is very athletic and a tom boy... don't know. Maybe the other one - who reads more - will like it later."
4,Tommy February!,"Another great Tommy CD, although even though I like this CD, it still isn't my top favorite of her CD's ever made, there are still a couple songs I really like on this CD, like ""DaNcin' baBy"" and ""The Rose Fragrance"".So all in all I still like it and rate it a 4, it just isn't my favorite CD of hers."
4,Indispensable!,"A great update to the original volume, which saves the Led Zeppelin ""live recording"" collector lots of time and money! If you collect Led Zep bootlegs on CD, then this book is for you!"
5,Suave,"Her voice is enchanting, I met her in NY this year and heard her sing live in front of an audience. She is very graceful, sensual, and last but not least professional. The CD is in no way disappointing compared to her live concert.Her performance brings a freshness to the scene of many female jazz singers. She has her own wide-range repertoire and is an independent-minded yet very focused performer.I think we will hear more of her in the press and musical reviews in the near future.Bravo Michelle!"
5,One of their best live shows caught on video ever,"This is one of the most entertaining performances I have seen on video. I dont know if its biased cuz I love U2, but the way Bono and the boys put on the show was so energetic and creative. IF there is one U2 Live show or one awesome live dvd you need to own. This is it!"
5,U2-Zoo -Live from Syd.,"Super all the way. This turned into a birthday present that will be loved forever. I bought for myself, after company heard at the house. they just had to have it. Thank god for birthdays that day. It turned into a present. Thank you - super item for sale. Very happy buyer."
1,U2 - Live From Sydney,"Avoid this DVD. U2 has much better concert DVDs. Unfortunately, this is not one of them."
2,"Etta is great, but this album is not","I had to give a couple of stars just because Etta's voice will always touch me, but this album is a disappointment. Some originally soulful and beautiful music is unfortunately rendered somewhat cheezy, similar to much of today's so-called ""smooth jazz."" If you have a discerning ear, an appreciation for the depth of her voice, or want to really FEEL the music, you are much better off with Chess Records' ""Etta James - Her Best,"" or the original ""At Last,"" both of which are phenomenal albums"
2,I am not sure where the Cuban part is supposed to be,"I am having their Cuban hamburgers right now as I type this review. Their Cuban hamburgers are more accurately described as ""extremely bland meatloaf on a bun."" What a waste of ingredients and time."
3,They're fading,"This is the last recording the Firehouse Five + Two made, as far as I know, and it shows. They're a little sloppy; the musicianship isn't what it was. Still, it's the Firehouse Five! It's fun, the good humor is there as always, and it's a great historical document."
5,Essential,"I hunted this book down for years and I am beyond pleased that it is back in print. Loomis' work are renowned for good reason, and this book in particular illuminates one of the more difficult subjects in drawing. It is a more technical manual,but it is still presented in Loomis' casual and easy to understand style. It is certainly for intermediate artists though, one needs only the very basics of perspective to make use of this book though. Loomis' Figure Drawing for all it's Worth sets a good foundation, so does Pespective Made Easy, a book that Loomis' recommends that is still in print to this day. Overall, this is a highly valued and amazing book on perspective."
5,A beautiful story,"I wish I had been able to meet this woman in person, but the writing is so personal and inviting that I feel as if I got to know her through her words. Another book that may be of interest isRiver of Hope: My Journey with Kathy in Search of Healing from Lou Gehrig's Diseasethat tells the story of one couple's loving determination to beat this horrible disease by figuring out what causes it. Amazingly, Kathy actually began to see improvements, such as once again being able to swallow some water and regaining some strength in her arms, which the medical professionals had told her was impossible."
1,A Maudlin biography of a great film star,"Oh dear! are the two words which spring to mind, as I consider the hours I spent wading through this damp squib of a book. Having read, and enjoyed, the latest Grant offering (In Name Only), I thought I'd back-track and try another Grant biog.This book, one-third of it being an index (yawn!), should guarantee the greatest insomniac the most perfect night's sleep. Where is the heart and soul of this work? Avoid at all costs!"
5,Suboxone-State of the art for consumers or therapists,"Having had access to the final drafts and being acknowledged for some technical assistance in finalising the text, I have no hesitation in recommending this book to anybody interested in obtaining a concise guide to Suboxone. Suboxone (Buprenorphine+Naloxone) is THE major advance in the treatment of opiate/ pain medication dependence/addiction in the last 30 years, and this book is an excellent explanation of the what, why, when and how it should be used. This book is useful to anyone who is interested in using Suboxone as a consumer, or prescriber, or learning about the details of this drug's use. If you have a heroin, opiate or pain pill problem, or know someone who has, buy this book to get an informed and concise reference to the most promising treatment for opiate dependence, a highly disabling, dangerous, and potentiallly fatal illness. This book could save your life."
1,"Definately not painless,atleast not for me.","I'm about a month clean from opiates now and I think Suboxone is BS. First of all it has a 72 hour half-life, which makes it take 6 days to get out've your system at the minimum. I tapered down to literally one microscopic crumb of Suboxone a day and I'd feel fine the first couple days after quitting. Then I'd feel withdrawals that were so slow and drawn out I'd go nuts and seriously want to off myself. So what I did was get back onto a small dose of Oxycontin, which made me feel slightly human compared to Suboxone, then I went through the 'Short n' Hard' withdrawals of Oxycontin. I'd take the Short n' hard withdrawals any day over long, drawn out withdrawals that make you so depressed you wanna off yourself. But to each there own, I guess things work differently for every person."
4,Bronte collection.,I liked Jane eyre very much. Didn't care as much for Tenant of wildfell hall. I recomend it. good buy.
3,bad fit,my euro van must be a big odd ball 93 2.5L the filter was fine but the gasket was way off take ur time find the rite part for ur motor code
3,Flynn Seeks Revenge,"Errol Flynn stars as a cowboy out to get revenge on the cattle rustler that has stolen his cattle and the cattle of several other men. He returns to San Antonio to settle the score, but before he can do that, he falls in love with Alexis Smith, the actress and singer performing at his enemy's saloon. Needless to say, things get complicated. This isn't the greatest of Flynn's westerns, although it's far from the worst. There's just nothing new here. Flynn was already starting to show the signs of the premature aging that would eventually lead to his death, and his performance lacks its usual fire. Smith, however, plays her character well and looks beautiful in the great technicolor. There is a terrific saloon shoutout/brawl, but it doesn't add up to much more than an average western. It's entertaining, but nothing special."
4,Approachable in-depth introduction,"This was the course book of our introductory course on data structures and algorithms, and it definitely served the purpose well.It goes in-depth, which I really appreciate. Make no mistakes: You should have a grasp of discrete mathematics and some Java/OOP exposure, but as long as you have that and maybe a basic understanding of Ordo notation (it's a 15 minute read online if you don't; the book covers it but that particular explanation is not that approachable if you don't know the concept or, like me, lack the mathematical rigor to find it easy).This book does exactly what it promises. While some passages take a re-read or two, I think it's the best and most-used course book in my Computer Science program so far.MIT and Stanford have great free online video lectures that goes well together with this book. I definitely find it easier to digest thanCormen et al, which will be my next book after this."
3,Not as good as I expected,It is a nice book but i expected something better. I don't know what it is but something is missing here. I like the C/C++ version of this book better for some serious learning. On the other hand this is a good opportunity to learn java programming at the same time if you haven't mastered it yet.
3,Good in analysis but too less basic Java,"I've to buy this book because it is a compulsory text in my Intro. to Data Structures class. After I've read almost of it here are things I found.The good:-lots of analysis about advantage and disadvantage in each algorithm (especially in sorting).-various and good idea in example implementation such as using tree traversal to evaluate expression or the use of disjoint set in making maze! (I like it.)The bad :-deep (and too much) mathemetical analysis in each data type and algorithm, is sometimes too hard to understand (and may be not necessary for me at all).-no context describing basic Java (e.g. How to compile java code; concept about method, object, instance, class).-after all, I think it costs too expensive for black and white text and poor illustration."
3,Pretty Funny,"There are a lot of laughs but again, the clips seem to be cut too short. Some you barely see what's so funny. The kids will love it. I'm way sick of Bob Saget and his predictable patter."
2,Persuasive Business Proposals,The book is not what I thought it was based on the people who recommended it. This is no reflection on the seller or their representation of the book. It is simply not what I needed.
2,boring,"Looks good, decent sound effects. Bruce Banner, however, talks way too slow and sounds like he rides the short bus. Anyway, I got bored with it in about 30 minutes."
5,THIS IS AWESOME,WITH THE GRAPHICS AND DETAILS THE VOICES THE 30 LEVELS AND THE FULLY INTERACTIVE ENVIRONMENT THIS WILL BE GREAT
1,"Fun at the beguinning, but boring after that",I rented the game and it looked like tons of fun in the beguinning (beating up military and throwing them into stuff). But when it came to beating up Halflife and The Leader it was way too hard. When you beat their first health meter they somehow miraculously get another health meter. Besides beating up the military the game sucks and is too hard to beat.
4,Original Sin,"I must say from the begining that Brandt is a friend. I am not a reader on a regular basis. I found his book interesting and I ended up finishing it in one day. I didn't know where it was going to go. I was wrong every time I thought I knew who did it. The chapters are short and keep moving. By the end of the book, you solve the detective story and understand what the title really means. You still don't really know Colton yet. I am sure more will be uncovered in the books to come.It is a great christian based novel. I am looking forward to the next two books."
4,Good if you like to categorize things,"While it didn't show me any names I liked that I haven't heard before, I did like the lists of what is popular, and it categorizes names in tons of ways, so it's kind of a fun way to look for a name. We still haven't chosen one yet, but we'll keep poring through the book."
3,"Okay, and has some good ideas","I liked some of the ideas that the authors presented, but overall I found the way that they broke up the book to be confusing. The names were not listed alphabetically, and in several cases I would read one section, and have some of the same names from earlier listed in another section. I will definitely be searching for another book to help me find a better variety of names with more organization."
2,Very outdated...,"I am expecting a baby in June of 2007 and ordered this book to assist with picking a baby name. Unfortunately, something I didn't notice when ordering is that the book was published in 1999. The book includes all sorts of lists of names - such as most popular baby names - however, the lists are all from 1998 or before. Trends in names seem to change, and since this book had not been updated in nine years it was of very little use. I have found the internet to be a much better resource."
2,"Good, except for unisex names","The one thing that I don't like about this book is their view on the unisex name issue. They seem to encourage the use of solid masculine names on girls, but they warn against using names like Avery and Morgan on boys because they think it will be bad for the boys with those names. I think that boys should reclaim the names that the girls have ""taken"" from them, and the girls should stop taking away good boy's names. Other than that, the book is fair to good."
1,Disappointed,"This book wasn't helpful to me at all. I didn't even bother to finish it. It just puts names into arbitrary groupings, which (as I said) wasn't really helpful. I don't care if the authors think the name I like is a ""feminissima"" name or a ""yuppie"" name - if you do, then this is probably the book for you."
5,Delightfully Inventive,"Keith R.A. DeCandido has really captured Star Trek in his first full length trek novel. If you are a fan of the Klingons, this book is a must read. Skillfully woven into the story are numerous Klingon characters from various episodes of both TNG and DS9. A delightful story of Worf's first assignment as a Federation Ambassador.To me trek novels fall into three catagories. There's the we've got to save this world, the federation or the galaxy type of story. The character study stories. And those stories that are truly unique. Diplomatic Implausibity falls into the last catagory. And as a bonus, you'll learn a lot of Klingon words and phrases. I can't see this book disappointing any trek fan."
5,Wonderfully Entertaining,"This may be DeCandido's best book so far. The plot is intricate: Worf has to find a middle path between the demands for independence of the natives and the political necessity of keeping the Klingon Empire intact. The Captain of the Gorkon doesn't trust him, the local governor is a ruthless, arrogant incompetent, and the natives are less than ecstatic to discover the Federation representative is a Klingon. There is a fair amount of action scenes in this book, both space and ground combat, and they are very good, although not to the level of the best in the Gorkon books. The dialogue and the character interaction are where the book really shines. The language is witty and incisive and wonderfully entertaining. All the characters are vividly and thoroughly portrayed, including several that lack such vividness in the Gorkon series."
4,Such a Befitting Title,"This was a nice story of love that truly never died. I like the way that Alvin never second guessed his love for Jolie. Jolie, on the other hand, was a different story. She gave Alvin and everyone else a hard time. There were a lot of bumps and bruises between Jolie and Alvin.In the end she finally stopped running away from her feelings for Alvin then we were able to ""Bring on the happy ending"""
5,The best wax for a black car,"I used this on my Black BMW Z4 with Zymol Lehm Klay III System and HD Cleanse first. Together, the cars shines like you. The wax feel more like you are oiling the car compared to other waxes you could by. This wax smells great and is easy to use.One thing that surprised me, if you have ever been in a new car showroom and you smell that new car smell, this wax restores that smell to the exterior. If you are thinking about other car waxes, don't! Get this with HD Cleanse and you will not be disappointed."
5,"Zymol, A good wax and good shine","I've tried a number of waxes over the years and this one is right up there. I tried this on a deep forest green Ford Ranger, after going over the whole thing with a clay bar. The shine was very nice under the lights and even better in the sun. Wether this wax shines that much better or provides any more protection than what I usually use (Meguiar's) it's hard so say. Is it worth the price? Meh, Maybe. The wax does go on easily and wipes off easily. Also the wax needs to be refrigerated after opening. Weird huh. Over all I'm satisfied with my purchase and may buy again"
2,Good diet.......cookbook ehhh........,"I lost weight on the Fat Flush diet, it worked well for me. I wanted to get a few more different recipes so I purchased this book. I agree with one reviewer who thought it was written in a hurry to get it out, and I also have to question how a nutritionist with a diet plan can write a book without any information as to nutritional values for the recipes. Calories, protein, sodium, carbs, etc. none of that is listed for the recipes in this book. Granted it is not a diet about counting calories but some of us still want to know. Also, information about wooden spoons and utensils? Really?? The writer assumes ignorance on the readers part. Anyone who cooks knows about these things. Just how many pages were needed for this book to publish it? Give me recipes, not filler."
3,Gift Purchase,Bought this book for a friend who wanted to find a healthier way to eat. He said the recipes were good and would recommend it to all.
4,"Good to start, hard to sustain","I give this book kudos for pointing out how harmful many of the toxins we regularly eat and drink are, and for suggesting avoiding artificial sweeteners. Pointing out that it's best to eat low glycemic carbs is good, but overall, this diet is unsustainable for the long haul. Especially if you have a family. The book itself is worthwhile for the information on detoxing, but then the ""typical"" consumer is going to have to tailor, significantly, in order to make it work."
2,The Fat Flush Cookbook,"Great ideas, however if one were to follow this plan it would be very costly... Most, not all products recommended need to come from specilty stores which have a high price range. IT would be great to go to a ""Spa for a month"" and have someone cook all your meals, however I am not in that income bracket...."
2,Misrepresented this product,"In the description, this product was represented as factory-new but when I received it, it was actually refurbished and reloaded. I will not buy from this supplier again."
2,vocal trance/techno tune that never quite hits the mark,"There are some ok female vocals, most of which are spoken, and each mix sounds promising, but gets very repetitive and never goes anywhere very powerful. Some is a noisier hardcore techno dub sound, some is ALMOST pretty trance, most of the time there isn't much of the vocal used. OK but not great. And in case you're wondering, no, the vocalist isn't Cheryl ""Got to be Real"" Lynn. This Cheryl has an E at the end of her last name."
3,Not as pictured,"Don't you hate it when you order something on line and it's ""not as pictured""?? This has a huge ""8th street music"" logo on it! I should send it back but I can't find another right now. Sheesh."
5,"Outstanding vintage book from the 1970's, about Jennie Jerome Churchill, mother of Winston Churchill.","I am interested in history. Popular TV series Downton Abbey triggered my interest in this time frame of history. I looked for books on Jennie Jerome Churchill, and found this and the second book and remembered they were popular in the 1970's. I bought them both and WAS TOTALLY THRILLED WITH BOTH VOLUMES. The photos, and the writing were so fascinating. Glad I found these used books."
2,"Fundamentally, a Check List","This book is a big check-list. Do not buy it if you are actually looking for building code information. However, it would probably be useful to contractors who want to be sure they have covered all bases. (I gave it two stars because it was not useful for me.)"
1,Color stripping and stiffening. My couch ruined,I got both rejuvanator and cleaner and followed instructions. This doesn't work for Ethan Allen fine very soft leather couch. After 24h of application of rejuvanator the sofa was really sticky I used the leatherique cleaner that didn't solve the problem (all the dust was vissible) plus I noticed it was stripping the color (burgundy). The leather became matte stiff.Not only it didn't take off stains but it damaged the protective finish and my sofa looks older than before application. It is ugly faded and course to the feel. I really regret that buy.
3,"Female Talk Show Host is kidnapped, but not for long!","I've bought every Van Wormer book in print hoping for a story the equal of ""Riverside Drive."" This book isn't, but it is still engaging reading . . . easy to put down and come back to. In most of Van Wormer's books there is a REAL sweaty Lesbian Love scene. None here but the 'relationships' from previous books are here . . . i.e., the Hollywood Star, the boss newscaster, etc. Neat detective work saves the talk show host's life."
2,THIS GAME IS...,"this game is pretty boring. it is not that bad though, it is kinda fun but weird. although i didn't finish the game yet (and im not even that far), i think the rest is weird. if youre looking for a sci-fi shooter, get halo. if you already have that game, wait until april 18, 2004 and get halo 2. i recomend you not waste your money and don't get this game. although, still, it isnt that bad."
1,Repetitive and Boring,"This game is probably the most repetitive and boring game of this genre I have played on the Xbox. While the game looks fairly decent in terms of the background animation, the characters, etc. you'll soon find out that there is nothing new as you progress from level to level. The aliens you fight all look the same. They supposedly learn your fighting patterns and develop new attacks however, I certainly didn't notice anything new except an occassional hop or lunge. If you use the auto-lock feature, you can bascially blast your way through them without any effort or skill. The game is tedious and boring. Rent it first before you waste your money."
4,Those who wrote positive reviews must work for Vivendi,"This is the absolute worst game I have yet played for XBox. The graphics are so-so at best during gameplay and a complete joke in the cut-scenes. (Vivendi animators should be ashamed- I've seen better cut scenes for N64!) The limited and awkward control settings make the game difficult to play. The bad guys are just Alien look-alikes (as in the Alien movies), yawn. Worst of all is the lame combat. Just let your gun ""lock-on"" automatically and keep pushing the button. No real skillz involved- just point somewhere sorta in the general direction and shoot. Don't believe the above reviews who say this game was great- they can't have played the same game I did."
1,Keep a dictionary handy,Okay so this review is a bit premature being that I've read up to the 16th page so far but I am highly irritated by all the complex words the author is using---especially for a story of BASKETBALL. The wording is making it difficult for the story to flow.
5,Tremendously involving!,"No matter what your reaction to this bazaar biography, I promise that you will find yourself thinking about Dare Wright's story long after you turn the final page. I found myself at times to be both riveted and repulsed by the imagery of this overly involved mother-daughter lifestyle. Dare Wright was deprived of any real life by her narcissistic mother, casting her into the role of model and object for her display. Dare's creation of a children's book series based on the adventures of a doll named for her mother is a perfect reflection of her own life, always posed to tell whatever inventions her mother required.There is little surprise in the overwhelming sadness of Dare's last years after her mother's death. However, the telling of this story is brilliant and not to be missed!"
3,Not What I Was Expecting,"It's my own fault for not reading the cover more closely, the book wasn't what I was expecting. While it was very well written, it didn't really interest me. The pictures included in the book makes Dare Wright seem very self absorb and in her own little world. Though she was extremely unhappy, you get the sense that she thought the world owed her something."
3,it's a koo coffe table book,this is a nice book to have on the coffee table for browsing. it has nice quality images. I actually thought the book be a lil bigger though. it's nice and small to carry around with you. It's also very informative--- a window into the japanese graphic world.
5,WOW! What a great book!,"I thought that this was a very suspense builing and exciting book! I loved it! It was one of Bonnie Bryants best yet, same with the two before, the riding camp ones 67# and 68#. I suggest this book to horselovers every where!!!!"
4,Nice knife,"I bought this knife to carry in my pocket, (although rather small) it is a light - nice little knife. Not too imposing and dangerious looking. This is the way I wanted it. The handle is rather plain (again I wanted it this way, because I take it with me when I travel...and I don't want the luggage handler guys to take from my luggage thinking its valauble. It fits perfectly in my small change pocket in my jeans. I do wish it came with a lanyard, as I had to make one myself out of some charcoal color paracord. All the money in this knife is in the blade, which I find quite sharp out of the box."
2,After School Special?,"Remember watching After School Specials when you were a kid? Those made for TV movies just for kids that were oh so dramatic and wrought with whatever kids found suspenseful? Well, that's how this book is written. It might be okay for the 12-14 year old set but it makes for tedious reading for literate adults. It's so predictable it's laughable. If you can't call the shots on this story then you don't follow professional cycling--every little cycling headline is somehow worked into this thing and it ends up as not very believable besides. Hokey is a word that comes to mind."
5,One intense read,"Has a touring non-competitive cyclist for about 18 years and a rabid follower of the Tour, Dave Shields owes me some sleep. I could not the book down. Missed too much sleep over this one.If this is what it takes to win the Tour, I am astonished that anyone and I mean anyone would ride it more than once.The dedication and discipline it takes is out of this world.I will read this book again and again."
4,Best Book on Cycling I have ever Read,This is a wonderful book. Dave has done a commendable job in explaining the subtleties of Bike Racing at the Highest level. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good read.
2,"Oops, people said it was good","Hard to put into words what makes this book so bad. Deadening prose style, characters from central casting, reliance on pure absorptive technique despite the prearranged result. Shields is also way too concerned about whether or not his readers understand bike racing and French.Oh, and you'll find yourself desparate to get back to present from the flashback passages. Allow me to summarize them in one sentence. Utah is pretty and full of backcountry yeoman-farmer fun, except for our hero's sulky father."
2,"OK, but very limited","I originally had one of these that I purchased from Sears under the Craftsman label. When the cam follower shook apart and stripped the mounting holes in the rear of the upper arm, I found that I would have to purchase a complete upper arm assembly to repair it. Through Sears, that would have added up to just over $120.00 with shipping for the part. I purchase this saw under the Palmgren name from Amazon for $89.00 about two months ago. It does OK for a beginner, but only accepts ""pinned"" blades. This limits what you can do with it and also limits your blade suppliers.There are better saws out there. I only purchased this one because it was cheap and I don't use it much. I would wait for the price to drop again before I purchased it here. However, Palmgren is selling this same saw on eBay for $169.00 plus shipping, so the price is better here if you need this right now."
5,Great collection of great works,"Drake's translation is very easy to read while still capturing the subtleties of Galileo's work. This volume is highly convenient because it has Galileo's best works in it, so if you want to read Galileo, start by reading this volume cover to cover. His letter to the Grand Duchess is particularly insightful."
3,Final Fight's successor,This game is one the most basic action games there is. But some people may like that. I did for a while and most people will. The boss fights are very straightforward and the game is pretty easy (except for the stealth missions). The physics are very good and the graphics are different but still good. The smashing missions are cool but the stealth missions suck... bad. the voice acting is decent but the music really gets annoying. The controls are easy to just pick up and play. Although all these great features a huge drawback is that the game is extremely short and has pretty little replay value. I would just suggest a rental thats the only way you'll get your money's worth.
3,"Game has promise, but....","I have been reading the Hulk comic book for many years. So as soon as this game came out, I bought it. Parts of this game are great and parts are very bad. A quick break down is when you play the Hulk, the game is fun. When you play Banner, it sucks!!!! Let me give you a reason for this. When you are the hulk, you get to destroy everything, beat people up and do all the joys of being the Hulk. But when you are Banner, you have to watch who you walk next to. No fighting with him, just walking around and doing easy puszzles. The level I'm on now has you walking around as Banner to get two chemicals. But you cannot walk too close to any soilders, which is near impossiable due to the fixed camrea that the game has. So in short, you could walk around the corner and BAM a soilder sees you before you see them. So I ask, How are you to aviod what you cannot see??? 3 of 5 stars and rent do not buy it."
5,Worth Waiting For,"Upon my viewing of ""Zoo TV: Live in Sydney"" at the tender age of ten, it is secure to articulate that I was most enamored with U2. Now being twenty-one years of age, this particular show still draws me. Despite having been previously stated before in aforementioned reviews, U2 are unquestionably at their best. That is not to declare that U2 attained their peak during the Zoo TV Tour, quite the contrary, for their tours succeeding have been and are just as extraordinary. After it was announced that Zoo TV should finally be released onto DVD, a U2 fan such as I could not facilitate but express delight and make purchase with all haste. I highly recommend this product."
5,Best CD I Own..,"Absolutly Pulley's best CD...it totally rocks. The melodies are incredible, and the lyrics actually have meaning."
1,Great book for a virgin or shut-in.,"I tell you, I noticed all of the great ratings on this book here and I have to say that I am simply shocked. It is literally hundreds of pages telling you to fantasize and to play with yourself during sex. Seriously? I just started writing a book. It's called ""How to breathe!""ATTN: If you are a virgin or maybe raised that sex was dirty, then go ahead and get it. If you are already into the ""dirtier"" stuff, then don't bother."
5,A different view.,"This book didn't tell me any techniques that I wasn't aware of, but it did help me to think of sex in a different way. Believe it or not...that helps. It helped me realize that its not something that is out of my hands and I should rely on myself. It empowered me in a way. I would definately suggest this for anyone to read.~ Angie"
4,interesting read...,"I was unsure of what to expect, I don't usually read books like this but I must say it has so wonderful tips for masturbation and female orgasms while on top!!!"
2,average,not as great as others have reviewed the book i could recommend female ejacualation and the g spot book which is much better read than this one
3,Gettin' better,"My girlfriend and I have dated nearly four years and oral sex has always been part of intercourse. I liked to see her happy, but I was a little tired of it. This book gave her some new ideas. So far, so good ..."
3,not bad,This book really doesn't give you much ideas as how to have better orgasms. It is common sense the advice that she gives you. This book is designed for someone who really doesn't know much about sex or their body.
1,This book is [bad].,There was nothing in this book that is not common sense. There are no special tips to learn. What a huge disappointment.
2,"OK book, but just download it online","This book is OK for those people who love to nitpick language, typically Standard Received English. In my neck of the words pidgin English usually works, along with pidgin Mandarin and Mongolian.But you can get this book at Language Log on-line, so why bother buying it? I guess to keep English majors gainfully employed."
4,Radio Flyer Ranger Wagon Review,"Item was sent in regular wagon box with no packing. Wagon was badly dented and completely unsatisfactory. We paid $22.00 plus to have it shipped and this is very disappointing!We did not open the box to put the wagon together until Christmas Eve (our mistake)! Regardless, this is very bad business!"
4,Very good quality,"Very good quality, in comparison for store prices half the price. Free shipping a plus!!!!"
2,Don't Get It,"The book is well written and nicely printed and bound; however the content is rather bland. Perhaps I misunderstand, but in my experience most people are pretty well versed in understanding the need for communication in conflict. I just don't get it. I am actually pretty good at conflict resolution but still find some situations challenging which is why I continue to read to find alternatives. If Gandhi had used this book India would still be under British rule.Conflicts are often pretty easy to resolve IF the parties want to communicate and this book does not really address that."
2,Not what I expected.,"I purchased this video because, with a full-time job and kids, I needed a video I could pop in at night and work-out to after the kids went to bed. This video isn't about that at all. It gives you a few simple exercises that you can work-out with each week, but it primarily involves a regime of walking everyday (with specific times and distances charted out weekly.) This didn't help me at all, since the entire point of buying a work-out video is to work-out in the privacy of my home. I didn't need a video to tell me to walk a mile in under 20 minutes each day to achieve toned thighs and legs."
5,Great little cookbook,"I just love this little book. I have many, many cookbooks to choose from and I've gone back to this one for several dishes already in the last two months since I've purchased. Although, I have not yet made a full menu as it recommends, taking pieces here and there has been just as wonderful. The dishes are gourmet in their presentation and ingredients, but not complicated to prepare. Perfect when cooking just for two on a nice quiet weekend."
5,Awesome romantic cookbook!,"I would highly recommend this for couples! I love to cook and cook every night but there are so many leftovers. This book has perfectly scaled recipes for two. Plus they come in menus that combine main courses, side dishes, drinks, and desserts with romantic ideas and tips! I love this book for romantic dinners and special occasions."
1,DUST everywhere!!!!,"I really wish i didn't buy a big box, i don't know should i stick with it and finish the whole box or just throw it out. SO MUCH DUST!! even when i just scooping/cleaning the litter box, make me cough and sneeze. If i were pouring more out from the box, even worse! I feel like i need to wear my respirator for mixing toxic chemical in order to breath. i think thats the smell of ammonia (not sure) but whatever this strong smell is so unbearable. I don't want to go to that side of the house, it make my breathing more difficult. And it sticks to my cat's paw a lot more than other litter, i found it on her paws all the time when she climbs on me, and of cause everywhere else in the house.i read on other website maybe only this one ""new ammonia block formula with baking soda crystals"" its not as good as it used to be. so maybe the old super scoop is better than this new one."
3,PA is going into the dirty old man phase,I have been reluctant to buy any of PA's books for awhile now since he seems to have been going more to the sex side of the stories than the original fun Xanth puns etc.While the 'adult conspiracy' has been present from the beginning the innocence angle of the series is gone and the plot lines now seem geared more toward the full revelation of the 'adult conspiracy' than the quests and fun of the earlier works. I am saddened by PA's change in content and think that this will by my last contribution to his coffers. If I want sexual content this is not the venue I would be looking at!
4,Charming and heartwarming,"Is there a writer's gene? If so, Sibley has inherited it from her talented grandmother. It is so refreshing to see young people value and honor the lessons of their elders. Sibley is a fine writer in her own right and I look forward to hearing more from her."
5,Classy Composer,"So many people compose...so many do so without an ability to connect with an audience...but Michael Touchi is not one of them! Tango Barocco features the unique pairing of alto saxophone (featuring the ageless Bill Trimble...) and English horn. It works! The piece lives up to its 'Baroque' title with the ornamental underpinning of the orchestration and clever role reversals between the soloists and ensemble. The always enjoyable tango elements pervade the entire work.For me, the heart of the disk are the choral works; stellar performances by the SJSU Choraliers, led by Charlene Archibeque at the pinnacle of her career.All of Touchi's music is, in essence, tonal - but has freshness and broad appeal. It's on my desktop rotation daily!"
5,Big Boy Music rocks!,"These people offer great customer service with shipment notices that come super fast. Had shirts within a day of ordering. Great quality too. These are nice, regular thickness shirts!Thank you!"
5,I've never read a Bombeck book I didn't like.......,"& this was the best. You can litterally place yourself in her shoes & experience comical things you could never have imagined happening to yourself. The way she narrates really grabs you into the book & won't let you go, & when your finished you need another of her books or you'll go into withdrawl syndrome. It was a horrible loss she died & took her comical genius that no one else has mastered with her."
4,It's Dave Matthews not Dave Matthews Band....,"I'm not a big fan of Gravedigger...but this album still has something to offer...After watching DM on MTV playing a couple of songs acoustically, I was really anxious to get ahold of this album, but, was disappointed because the accompanying music added to the acoustic versions that drew me in, turned me off a little. I think I would have much rather had an album with these songs performed acoustically.What I liked about the album is that DM explores several different genres of music and the album showcases blues, folk, soul, and even an attempt at reggae. I'm not saying that all of these genres are explored successfully, but, it's nice to see an artist trying to expand upon their talents rather than repackaging the same music. This album is not a DMB album, it's a DM album. If you can appreciate a difference, you will appreciate this album.Album Highlights: Grey Blue Eyes, So Damn Lucky, Save Me"
3,better with the band,There are some good songs on here but I like Dave better with the band. DMB albums command my attention and this one totally allowed me to drift and forget what I was listening too. This is not something you need to own.
5,DAVE RULZZ MAN,"THIS ALBUM DOES NO NEED ANY GRAVEDIGGER MAN!!!This is probably one his best albums. Dave matthews i think has evolved as a man ........and it shows in his music.gravedigger , dodo ,So Damn Lucky are all up there.Other songs are good as well.(baby,Oh ...)I think this year we are seeing some really good albums rush on the head...etc.CHEERS!!!"
2,Is This Dave Matthews?,"I could have just matched myself with the wrong CD. I thought this CD was boring, and usual. The only song I enjoyed was the live version of 'Grey Street' on the bonus disc. I found this track amazing to listen to. I personally think Dave should go back with the band, but that's just me."
5,Listening to Heaven,"LOVEEEEEEEE this collection of Dave's unique work. Amazing solo project, not like his work with the band. A refreshing and soothing change!"
2,A Gentle Reflection,"I am sure that many of Matthews' behavioural problems are actually symptoms of psychological dysfunction far too deep for a layman like myself to interpret or analyze with any degree of accuracy. Often, it seems, near-madness seems to be a close neighbour of creative genius, Van Gogh being the most popular example I can cite. One thing I have discovered about the human memory is the longer one seeks for answers the more one finds.Certainly, the objective of Matthews' ""Some Devil"" seems to be to intentionally provoke his audience. Perhaps we should act as we would with a three-year-old spoiled toddler and simply ignore him.For my part, I'm a bit relieved not to have to worry about being devoured by the Tyrannosaurus that is this listening experience. Unfortunately, upon listening to this recording, I find myself being devoured instead on a much subtler plane, by a host of parasitical beings collectively known as ""Dave Matthews"". Sometimes I think I would have preferred the Rex..."
5,"Thank you, Dave!","I think this may be my favorite CD of all time (of course, Dave's been my favorite for years, so I'm a bit biased). Actually, the last couple of CDs by DMB have been a bit disappointing, which makes this solo CD a real surprise. Many are saying that it's different from his early stuff, but to me, except for the lack of jam songs, it's more like his early stuff than it is like Before These Crowded Streets and Busted Stuff.What I most enjoy are the beautiful lyrics combined with peacefully powerful melodies, and Dave's amazing voice. This CD has a very positive, hopeful undertone, despite the seemingly melancholy sounds of Some Devil and some others. Some seem downright spiritual. I don't think everyone will like this CD, as Dave can be kind of eclectic, but it's worth a listen. And like others have already said, if you're a 'true' Dave Matthews fan, I think you'll really enjoy this CD. Thanks Dave Matthews!"
2,The Devil Made Me Buy This Album,"So what do you get when you put Dave Matthews, Tim Reynolds and Trey Anastasio in the same room? $10 worth of dissappointment.All the songs sound like stuff they've done before, or we've heard from other artists. So Damn Lucky sounds like a reprise of You Never Know from the Busted Stuff album. Up and Away is No Woman No Cry. Baby sounds like a tune from David Byrne Finite=Alright from the album Feelings. As for the rest of the songs, it's hard to tell when one ends and a new one begins. I actually had to look at my cd player to see what track it was on. I thought it was bad when Will Smith sampled Rock the Casbah, but Dave has sunk to a new low with sampling nursery rhymes. I do like the bonus stuff with Tim, if they really wanted to get into marketing, the should have sold it seperately. Some Devil will make a great coaster for your beverages. If Dave had recorded these songs with Roi, Carter, Boyd and Stephan, at least the music would have been interesting."
5,Awsome,Excellent Debut solo album from Dave Matthews. I loved every song on the CD.This is a must buy Cd from Dave Matthews fans. If you are just starting to listin to DMB buy this CD.
3,Talented... But Lacking Something,"When I heard ""Gravedigger"" I was very excited about the new Dave Matthews solo album, but when I actually heard ""Some Devil"" I was quite dissapointed. I have been a DMB fan since ""Under The Table And Dreaming"" came out. I felt that this album was just lacking something. It didn't have that energized feel that the rest of the band has when they are together. Of course it has its stand out songs in ""Oh"", ""Stay or Leave"", ""Save Me"", and ""Gravedigger"", but I feel that the rest of the album has no life and is very repetitive. I find myself listening to the Dave and Tim live cd that came with ""Some Devil"" more often then the actual cd. If you have never heard Dave I don't suggest this album, and if you are a major Dave fan buy this album for the few songs that stand out, just don't expect the five star album everyone else reviewing it has given it."
2,"Davey, Davey, Davey...","I know a paulbearer, and he just bought this CD because it is perfect for his funerals. Most of the songs feature Dave moaning in agony, with funeral music in the background. Nothing like Crash, Space Between, etc...It's good homework music, and that's about it. Buy ""Crash"" or ""Everyday"" instead. Save your money folks, and if you do go buy it, don't say I didn't wanrn you...."
2,Disillusioned,"Dave seems to be on a downward spin ever since he and his band scrapped their original ""Busted Stuff"" album in summer 2000. I'm missing stuff in the vein of their first two albums, which are my favorites. Everyday was not impressive, but it had a few good one. Busted Stuff I thought was a HUGE disappointment compared to the original tracks. Some Devil, too, was a disappointment. Everything sounds the same, and that's not a good thing. It all sounds like the same, slow, monotnous guitar with Dave's voice keeping pace. Not good. The Bonus disc though is its redemption. The live version of Stay Or Leave is my favorite track. It sounds nothing like the studio version. All in all: Dave get your act together."
3,"technically excellent, artistically useless","cryptopsy return with another album of impressive musicianship that has no direction artistically and is chaotic with no form. Where Gorguts ""Obscura"" was by far more technical than this album and incredibly managed to structure it all as well, this album does neither and is overall a let down. None so Vile is still cryptopsy's pinnacle album, and I hope they will someday return with the energy and focus of that album."
1,This is awful,"""And Then You'll Beg"", Cryptopsy's fourth addition to their growing discography, is a step lower than 1998's ""Whisper Supremacy"". While the music has slightly improved since that release (and not by much), DiSalvo's awful vocal attempts single-handedly discredits the serious attitude that the band is attempting to convey. Regarding structure, Cryptopsy maintains the lightning-pace of earlier albums, yet the guitar lines are fairly incoherent throughout. It is a shame, as one can see how much Jon has improved since the band's masterpiece '96 ""None So Vile"". Oh well. . . maybe next one."
4,Interesting Read from a woman's perspective.,"I had just finished getting a humorous blog update from the Baby Boomer Bachelor, also available on Amazon as a Kindle download, and thought I would see what the Baby Boomer Bachelorette had to offer. Most interesting reading! My dating experiences more align with some of the weirdness of the bachelor's experiences, which goes to show you how the dating scene is unique at any age. I recommend Patsy's book as a good read of the boomer dating scene from a woman's perspective. If you need a man's perspective, the baby boomer bachelor is a good read as well. I would love to see Patsy and Eric hook up. That would create some fun fireworks!!"
2,Brokeback Batman,"PLEASE!!! So mediocre, just a lot of whining and pining. Loeb was great with Long Halloween, etc. But this is drivel. Gets a second star for the art."
2,Potty training for Dummies,"Yes, Jessica (the announcer girl)is cute and little kids might like her, but she talks to you like you're a moron. And the children in the video are all way too old to still be potty training. Some of them have lost their top baby teeth already! They should have been out of diapers years ago. The video should have used children of appropriate age. My son is 2 and he loves to watch the video but he has no intention of doing what they are showing him to do. I honestly don't know how effective it is. It seemed very dumb to me.Valerie (mother of 2 boys)"
1,I guess anyone can make a DVD these days...,"The language tht they use in this DVD I feel is offensive and demeaning to children. ""Only babies to do this, only babies do that!"" You don't need to be negative to potty train a child. Also, there are no doctors or psychologists that recommend it. I would not get it for anyone."
2,Creepy ending,"I read the reviews and was looking forward to this video for my almost 4 year old son. First problem is that it says its for boys and girls but the story at the end is about a princess who didn't want to use her potty chair. The king and the queen were at a loss as to what to do. So they had their ""jester"" paint the potty chair. The jester is SO CREEPY! My son says he's scared to watch the movie now. It would have been okay except for the last part. So if we watch it again, we'll just stop before the creepy part."
5,One of the better training videos,"We've tried a few other titles, but this one seemed to stand out and become the favorite. In our home with two toddler girls, POTTY POWER is a huge hit. Jessica, the hostess, sings and talks you through the motions of learning to be a ""big kid"" and use the potty. Everything from throwing away the diapers, to wiping away the poop and thoroughly washing your hands is covered here in very simple to understand and easy to follow steps. Only disappointing part is at the end when the dressed up characters of King, Queen and Jester try to convince the princess to begin using her potty. It's slightly annoying for adults, but kids will think it's cute. I loved the songs, very catchy and my daughters sing along and have already imitated the steps to go to the potty on their own."
5,We have potty power!!,"This video was THE reason my 2 1/2 yr old finally decided to potty train. The fist two weeks we had this DVD, she asked to watch it multiple times a day. The songs are cute and catchy. My daughter is always quoting the messages she learned from this video, ""No more diapers for me!"" ""I want to be a big kid!"" ""Wash my hands after going potty!"" ""I have Potty Power!"" It gave her the confidence she needed. I can't rave enough about this video for how it helped our family."
5,Really helps!!,"I have a stubborn little girl who has been resisting the potty since she was 2 also. I felt like she ""knew"" how to do it, but she was purposely being difficult--some kind of power struggle or something. She loves the DVD! She watched it over and over every day for about 2 weeks but wouldn't do it herself. A combination of perseverance and PANTIES--not PULLUPS, along with the DVD really helped. She is still saying...""I can do it just like Potty Power!!!"" She is so excited and so are we. No more diapers OR Pull Ups OR accidents just 3 weeks after she decided to get serious about this.. Good luck..I highly recommend it. I must add that I think the ""power"" behind this little movie is that it uses some postive peer influences. You see all these cute and happy little kids using the potty and being proud of themselves, throwing out diapers, etc. Great idea..because the next best thing is having your toddler around another toddler who has started to potty train."
2,"Fun, but not effective","""Potty Power"" may work for some children, but it was not effective for my 2 1/2 year old son. He definitely enjoyed watching the dvd, but it has not motivated him to start using the potty at all. If you have children who enjoy singing along to songs and like doing what other kids do, then they will probably benefit from ""Potty Power."" But for those with kids like my son who is more of the shy, independent type and does not like to sing-a-long, then this isn't the right pick.This dvd, like many, many potty training materials is geared toward training with a potty chair and not the regular toilet. I'd like to find a dvd or book that is geared toward learning without using a potty chair first."
3,More for girls,"I havea 3-year-old son. This video did not hold his interest at all. The video itself seemed okay, just geared more for girls. After about 30 seconds my son stopped watching. The video is designed around a princess, and I thought the songs were a bit cheesy. I'm sad I wasted my money, but everybody's different, you might like it."
3,This is a good aide.,The songs were very catchy. My daughter seemed to really like and respond to it. The reasoning and logic are very much geared towards older potty trainers. I would recommend this video for older children in the 3 to 4 year range.
3,"very cute, catchy tunes, but still no potty power!","I got this video for my soon-to-be-3 year-old son who was showing interest in potty training. I was encouraged by all the reviews which said their children were so inspired that they were trained the next day. What do they say about something sounding too good to be true? Anyway, my son loved watching this video--the songs are very cute and catchy--he sings them all the time--and he even peed in his potty a couple of times while watching the video, but he still insists on wearing diapers! I would recommend this video, but don't expect an overnight training!!"
5,Great for older kids,"My granddaughter is 3 1/2. She has some motor skills problems, and we still haven't been able to conquer the potty. However, for that older, more resistant child, this video is great. I can see it starting to change her views of the whole process (we've only had it a couple of weeks and we are taking this process slowly). I like that it's live action rather than cartoons, all the kids are older, the presenter is upbeat, more information is given (all the essentials, including handwashing and wiping front-to-back), lots of great songs and a very cute story at the end. I think this one is finally going to work for us, better than Once Upon a Potty. The context is ""I want to be a big kid now"".Update (6/1): My granddaughter is now completely trained; much of the credit goes to this video!! It took only a couple of weeks! A must-have!!"
2,Forget it,"Had high hopes for this one, but it did not hold any interest for my 18 month or 2-1/2 year old grand children. They watched it once, and didn't seem to get into it at all; and it certainly didn't inspire them to use the potty."
5,Potty Training Must,"This video is filled with music, great images and introduces the potty process as a fun exciting event. We bring my daughters potty in front of the tv and she sits on it and watches. I have watched her investigate the potty while watching the video as well. This was a purchase that I am very happy to have made."
2,Didn't work for us,"Could be a matter of personal taste, but my 2-year-old daughter was not impressed with this video - she was much more responsive to Elmo's Potty Time. The story is cute and the young woman is friendly enough, but my daughter was bored 10 minutes into it and left the room."
3,Kids had no interest in it,my 2.5 yr old twin girls had no interest in this dvd....and they love watching movies. it may work for some kids but unfortunately not mine.
3,"Not bad, wouldn't recommend for boys","My son watched this video, but really couldn't relate to the princess plot. It is advertised for boys and girls, but I think it is geared mainly for girls. I can't recommend this video for potty training a boy."
1,Not necessary for potty training,"I got it, but after watching it realized, it is not really necessary... it does show some ""big kids"" on the potty, but the quiz is probably more geared up towards 3years old-somethings... my son is 20 months and he still sleeps in his crib etc...and the message was not very clear- I'd prefer step-by-step instructions... the princess story is not necessary I agree, won't even let my boy watch it- he is no princess for sure.. I wish I did not buy it- not necessary, really..."
5,Excellent,"My daughter loved all the singing and it has a princess story at the end to help incorperate the potty chair. It helped us when this was our last resort. She was 3.5 years old and was stubborn about using the potty to poo, with this video she learned to do it and shout ""I've got potty power!!!"" after each time. Now she loves to just watch the video for fun and tells me she is no longer a baby but a big kid."
1,"Warning: This is NOT the James Grant, formerly of ""Love & Money""","This is not the James Grant of albums like ""Holy Love,"" etc.Nice guitar work, but it's all instrumental and again, NOT singer/songwriter James Grant from England."
5,Amazing Story about What Can Go Wrong in Justice System,Every American should read this book. Every American should have known what was happening to Susan McDougal because it could happen to anyone.
1,Tastes Terrible!!!,"I love hollandaise sauce, but this stuff smelled horrible and tasted even worse... by far the worst thing I have ever tasted"
3,Go for the Senergy model,"Princeton Digital is really shooting themselves in the foot (feet?) by creating three separate lines of LCD monitors (SENergy, LCD and SL) and then selling the supposedly ""high-end"" SENergy series at low prices. If you want a 17"" LCD monitor, check out the Priceton SENergy 714, which is a better-quality monitor for the same price -- lower if you can find a rebate. The SENergy monitors are better quality and also better supported. I really don't see why Princeton doesn't just consolidate all the products into one line and make sure all their offerings are solid in quality. Their ""value""-oriented SL line is pissing off a lot of people."
5,Awesome realities,This book is a must have for todays business managers in the ever changing world of sales. I am amazed at the insight and accuracy depicted in the book. It assisted me in the re-engineering of a tired sales force. Two thumbs up!
1,Defective Hearing Aid,Bought this hearing amplifier for my 98 year old mother who has trouble hearing the last year. I thought this might be a simple aid for her to use. I tried it first and it does not work. It just makes a amplifier type hum in my ear. It was inexpensive so I thought it might be worth a try.
1,A piece of junk! Don't waste your money!,HORRIBLE - purchased this product for my father and it is an absolute piece of junk. Immediately put in back in the mail for a refund. I think they must be making a lot of money on elderly people that purchase this hearing aid and then can't get to the post office to return it. The cost is not that much so most people probably just drop it in the trash. You put the battery in and it has a high pitched ringing sound. It is a crime to sell this product.PS - I had to click one star to submit this rating - should be 0 stars
4,It represented to me the definite resource about IP routing,"In my working activities I happen to meet sometimes, but not too frequently, issues about IP routing architectures. Needing to consolidate my background about the subject, I tried to read some publications, that, in spite of editorial reviews, did not satisfy me, being lost about TCP/IP details more than routing issues. This book help me to fix this cultural flaws and represented the definite resource about routing. Maybe I have not been able to fully appreciate it because I am not a network engineer or administrator, and some chapters become too detailed for people having general, and not specialistic, requirements. But I must agree that reading this book made me to know something I did not before, at a sufficient level of detail. That is what I need to state that a book is worth its price."
4,A must read on BGP,This is a great book to get the fundamentals of BGP and many advanced concepts related to BGP on the internet and in your enterprise. Even though Halabi wrote the latest edition almost 10 years ago the information is very relative to today. It is of course very Cisco specific but gives you a great understanding of how the protocol works and will help any engineer who deals with BGP. A must read.
2,"Great Work, terrible conduction","Painful to say it, but this is a terrible recording of what is probably the best opera written in the last century, Strauss excepted. Madelena's News aria is the quintessential aria of the 20th century and I am glad we have this recording, but a new one is sorrly needed. The problem here is that Edo's conducting is simply sloppy, the playing out of balance and limp. Oh, if only you could have heard Spano's perforamnce at the Brooklyn Philharmonic two years ago. THAT should have been recorded and released....stunning in scope and depth and full of precise in your face vigor. The cast here is mostly fantastic, except for madame mao. While this recording is a must for now, because it is the only one that exists, we can hope and pray for the eventual definitive recording to be made. I am not sure John Adams will ever write anything better than this.......and his masterpiece surely deserves a better interpretation than this hastily thrown together original cast recording."
2,OUtfeed table is bent badly,"Got the tool al assembled and everything, nice, rock-solid fence, good looking tool. I went to run some boards... not straight. Turns out the outfeed table is bent badly upwards as it leaves the body of the tool, making it impossible to joint a board more than about 1 foot long. Looks like maybe it was dropped at the factory or something, as the shipping boxes show no sign of the kind of catastrophic shock it would take to bend that much cast iron that much. I'm returning it for a replacement of the same tool, because otherwise, it seems like a great little jointer."
3,john mcfarlane,"Great swing. But limited to very small children. There was a missing part, a swing hook, and I'm having trouble contacting someone for the missing part. I ordered through Amazon and not a retailer but can't get help. Help me!Naturally Playful Playhouse Climber & Swing Extension"
3,What ever happened to the real Yanni?,"Has Yanni done anything new in the last several years? All I've ever run into is yet another go-round of a sampler, either with re-mixes or new instrumentation, but still the same songs. Wherever Yanni is I hope he comes out of hiding soon. There are only so many different ways you can re-package the same thing."

1,THIS BOOK SUCKED,"IF THERE WERE ANY LOWER NUMBER OF STARS THAN ONE, I WOULD HAVE RATED THIS BOOK SUCH. IT TRULY SUCKED, & I TOOK IT BACK TO THE STORE FOR A FULL REFUND. THE GRAPHS WERE AWFUL, THE CONTENT WENT ON AD INFINITUM, LEAVING THE READER CLUELESS AS TO WHY THIS AUTHOR EVER DECIDED TO BECOME AN AUTHOR? THERE WERE NO CASE STUDIES, OR ANYTHING REGARDING A GRASS ROOTS APPROACH TO THE IMPLIMENTATION PROCESS. IT WAS TERRIBLE!!!"
5,Great price.,Great price for these baffles. They fit well and seem to function as intended and the price was much less than others.
4,great story of a great man,"Meat Loaf's colourful life story is written with insight,sensitivity and almost painful honesty.All this combined with an irresistible sense of humour makes for a great read.The god of sex ,drums an rock an roll is a testament to the old adage""you cant keep a good man down"" .Having always been a huge fan I like mr Loaf even more after reading this"
3,Meat Loaf fan looking for more.....,"As I am an avid reader of biographies and memoirs and historical non fiction, I found this book disappointing. I found the beginning informative and interesting but got lost with out specific dates, times and places after the death of his mother. Meat Loaf does not tie in the meeting of his wife, relationship with her daughter and their child into his career. These items are self-contained in their own chapters. Also, I found the missing photo descriptions bothersome, lack of background on song writing and his elimination of long term goals or thoughts for the future disappointing. I wish Meat had spent more time describing the creation and evolution of his and Steinman's lyrics, as he did with some of the mixing and studio work.I have rated this book with three stars because of the nature of the stories, the courage it took to tell and to share and the fact the author is not a writer."
5,"Great work, James!",This book appeals to the corporate in all of us. Rogauskas could not have described cubicle life more aptly or with more sense of humor. A great seventeen-syllable approach to stress management. Every office needs at least one copy!
5,Great hair product.,This is an excellent product. It repairs curling iron & hair dryer damaged hair. It's very light and not heavy on your hair. It also smells great.

5,A must follow up,"Dave has done it again in The Tour, a sequel to The Race (also very highly recommended). The Tour takes up the story of Ben immediately after the events of The Race (I am doing my best not to give anything away ;-) ). The Tour is in many ways the ""dark side"" of the The Race, examining the unsavory side of the sport: doping (a governing body has recently proposed a 4 year ban for cyclists that test positive for PED's -Performance Enhancing Drugs-and I am all for it). Cheating by one leads to the cheating of many in an effort (""justifiable"", in a way, as these cyclists give up years of their lives training for these races) to keep up. Hopefully we have turned the corner.A highly recommended read. Read The Race first, although one could certainly read this book as a stand alone, but you'd be gyping yourself out of another fantastic read.Now help me to convince Dave to write a Giro-version sequel to Ben's cycling adventures. ;-)"
5,Good looks and great quality,This watch is a great deal for your money. Seiko is a great quality watch and the look is very elegant. This watch is much thinner and lighter than my old Seiko. I love it.
4,Seiko Watch,"Very pretty watch - I shooped this watch in stores before purchasing online so I knew what to expect and I was not dissapointed. The bonus is that by purchasing online, I paid almost $100 less than what I would have paid at several of the big department stores where I found it."
3,Tracks 1-3 Bland Tracks 4-6 Great,For a single it is ok. It has Six Tracks on it. Many of the old fans will wonder what is this? If you do buy it you will find this Single to be best in tracks four thru six. >>>Fair warning: Buyer Beware
2,disappointing,"I'm not the biggest fan of Edward's scrapbooking style. To me it looks too spare (she's a big fan of white space). However, because there were pages by other scrapbookers, I wanted to give it a look. I didn't find anything inspiring in this book; it was about 3/4 full of Ali's own pages (just to let you know).I guess it just wasn't my thing. I get scrapbooking books for innovative pages and techniques. I just didn't feel there was a lot I could do with this one. (However, I would like to say that I appreciate Edwards generally. I enjoy her online classes and I have her book on patterned paper that I really do like.)"
5,musical perfection,"Pain of Salvation have succeeded in creating a sound beyond anything else i've ever heard....where most progressive metal fails, PofS excel. unique vocal stylings, tremendously varied. amazing passionate lyrics. concepts that aren't embarassingly simple or ripped-off(listen up, Dream Theater), music that never sounds showy, music that contains more feeling than most anything i've ever heard. it's difficult music to get into...but extraordinarily worthwhile to do so."
5,Smashing debut.,I could not put this book down. From start to finish it is a genuine thiller to keep the reader on edge. I can't wait for Twining's next book. He has me hooked.
4,Entertaining Page Turner,"Fast paced thriller and 1st book in series. Some predictable plot twists countered with some you did not see coming. 3 members of the family all gave it a thumbs up and it is the second novel we have read in this series. A good mix of history, modern day intrigue, and a story of some likable characters to trying to redeem themselves. Bondesque travel and action from one European locale to another."
1,What in the world?,I have not read this book and it is not the kind of book I would read. Sorry I have no good or bad review.
3,Enjoyed,This cheap was okay should have had more chart type music to sing too.I would recomment this to a friend
4,"A joy to listen to: Your Love, My Home by Joshua Payne","Joshua Payne is a songwriter/entertainer who started off in life almost totally deaf. Through the musical interests of his parents, he grew to love opera and the finer styles of music. He trained, practiced his love of music and theatre, and is now living his dream. His cd brings back the feeling of young love and love of such intensity that it encaptures the soul. The relaxing sound of ""If"" and ""Let it be Me"" is sung with such emotion that it makes your heart pound. I think he'll be seen and heard often in the future. I'm a huge Josh Groban fan, and I think the comparison of the two is unfair to the separate talents of each, and the intensity of their voices. Each young man can be enjoyed by all audiences each in themselves"
2,Potentially Great Voice...Just Not Yet,"I have to agree with most of the other reviewers on this one...Payne has a nice, sweet, run-of-the-mill voice, but it lacks the conviction of his fellows such as Josh Groban. When I first heard the latter's voice I was amazed, moved, and an immediate fan.When it comes to Payne, although I like all of the songs on the album and they are all very pretty, there is just something missing. I think Joshua Payne is going to take a while to grow on me, but I would really like to see him develop his own style. It seems to me that all of these tracks are only copying Groban, and Payne would do much better to develop into his own voice.Still, the album is nice, just done before. Possibly a buy at the music store if nothing else jumps out at you."
3,Nothing special,"I was a big fan of his father Luther, and loved all of his live stuff. This Cd is nothing special to me. It has some great tunes, but then has a few weak moments. It might be good to actually be there and see him play."
5,Nice and Concise,"I used this book at my friend's house and liked it because it was brief and yet had everything in it. If this particular tradition (Conservative/ United Synagogue of America) suits you as it does me you will probably like it too. If you like brief service, do not read Hebrew well or fast, you may like it ever more, because the transliterations are nicely done also."
5,More Please,This is such an interesting story following the life of an orphan. Will definitely look for more Bryce Courtenay books.
5,The Best !!!,"I do a lot of photo editing, and although I use several, this is the software that I use most often. It's very user friendly and easy to use. I absolutely love this, and my best friend also purchased this very same software after I showed her how to edit photos with it :) This is the best editing software ever. Who wants to learn photoshop, its so hard to learn, and I know very little about it, even though I own it... I always come back to this software when I'm editing my photos."
5,Amazing Book,"Having had the honor of having Steven Stipelman as a professor, this book is the next best thing to learning with him. When I read this book, I feel as if Professor Stipelman himself is giving me a demonstration. It is a great book for beginning illustrators, advanced illustrators, and all of those in between. No other illustration book out there shows you the amount of techniques that this one does. If you can only buy one illustration book, make it this one! you will not be sorry!"
1,This Company is Corrupt,"This company McBlain Books is corrupt. They say this book is a hardcover it is not. In fact it is a Obituary of a deceased man, not an authored text. This company stole my $20 for an obituary. Shame, SHAME, SHAME on you!!!!"
2,the light was too small to look,It is hard to tell about the light because it looks very different to see on the internet then to see if the item is front of your eyes.The light was too small for my bike
3,Good character development,"It took me approximately 200 pages to get engaged in the storyline. After that, I became interested to know what would happen in the end. The main characters are well-developed and the story does a good job of portraying the struggle many people go through when trying to balance the choices that are presented in every day life."
2,do not reccomend,"I don't know if it is just ours, but the music on this shape sorter sounds horrible, ""tingy"" like it is running out of batteries, even when it isn't.My daughter likes the more simple stacker w/ a pole and donut shaped circles. This one is a hard for kids to stack, she couldn't do it until 1.5, and the music is unpredictable."
2,Very loud!,"We received this toy as a gift when my daughter was 6 months old. She liked the toy because it made interesting sounds, but it is WAY too loud. I had to put a scotch tape over the sound holes to make it quieter.Although my daughter liked the sounds, the holes on each toy was too small for her to successfully stack the toys. She is 13 months old now, and she still gets frustrated with it.After about two months of use, this toy started to make noises on its own even if no body is near the toy.My daughter likes the cheep ($4.99) classic stacking rings by Fisher-Price far better than this toy."
4,"Informative, but DENSE!!","Very informative book that covers a great deal of information. Not overtly biased like some other Soviet history works. VERY DENSE, not an ""easy"" read. It assumes some prior knowledge of soviet/russian history. Not recommended for anyone new to soviet history who is not prepared to do background research. Good reference though and quite detailed."
1,"Very Poor Quality, not recommended","I've owned this charger for 2 years and never could use the line out due to very poor quality sound. This didn't phase me too much, because I would just use the ipods line out and the Incase for it's charging capability. Unfortunately after 6 months the casing fell apart. This was inconvienant, but the charge still worked so it wasn't a total loss until 6 months later when the car charger stopped working.Bottom line: One of the worst electronic product experiences I've ever had."
3,"Good, Not Great","I didn't know what to expect when I bought this album. But after a few listens, I decided that I liked it although the songs were really no big deal. Although pleasant and at times interesting, they just didn't seemm to stick with me. A good effort, but ultimately not that satisfying."
2,UGLY BUT FUNCTIONAL,"The price and the brand is the reason I'd bought it. The Walkman case is standard and it has a durable nylon exterior. The strap attached to the case is fixed and sewn on. It is approximately 2.3 inch (58mm) thick and it looks exactly like a chunky luggage belt (which is my main complaint).It seems the makers had placed very ""little"" effort into it. I don't care much for the color. Who wants anything that's grey anyway (unless if you still live in the early 80s)? Grey must have been the color of indecisiveness. Perhaps something chosen out of compromise. It's neither one nor the other.I haven't used it yet. I am too embarrassed to be seen with it in public. If you need a cheap and functional CD Walkman carrying case, then this is the product for you. Don't expect too much in terms of aesthetics. I may have to look for another case in the future. Look out, for some friend of yours (me for example) might palm this item off to you as a reject."
4,"Good, better than the critic's review but not her best.",The critics review is part right: this ain't no Famous Blue Raincoat. It isn't as even. But cut her some slack will ya. I enjoyed much of it and skiped the overly sweet stuff. Production is good and she can write songs too! Rick Yurick
4,GOoD STORY ABOUT GHOSTS,this book was great. it tells the story of a 13 year old girl who moves to doreset. she dosent want to go but ends up have the adventure of a lifetime when see meets a ghost named tamsin.
5,a pleasant surprise,"I only bought this book because my first name happens to be Tamsin...but then I read it, and I can hardly remember a book that I loved more.The characters are superb: the comical boggart and the billy-blind reminded me a lot of my old downstairs neighbour, while the baddie was simply a masterpiece of suave villainy.It's a ghost story, but it's also a tale of love, and especially of friendship. The intensity and poignancy of the friendship between Jenny and Tamsin made my heart sing and ache. The book is full of vivid little details and observations: Jenny obsesses over her hair and skin, while Tamsin remembers her anxiety over her wolf tooth; Tamsin's crush on Jenny's step-brother, Tony; the way Jenny felt when Tamsin smiles at her. Such touches express the pain and glory of the protagonist, ""stopped"" at the dawn of her womanhood, and haunted by a dread she cannot bear to name.It's a beautiful book, and I'm sure I shall be reading it again many times."
5,Batman Gets Interesting (Again),"There's a good chance that if you are reading this review, you already know what Batman: No Man's Land is. If not, here's a brief summary. Batman: No Man's Land was a year long crossover that revitalized Batman as he fought to restore a Gotham city shut off from the outside world after a devastating earthquake. Trade paperback number three kicked this storyline into high gear!!!! With awesome stories by Greg Rucka and Devin Grayson, coupled with the art of Mike Deodato and many of comic's best artistic talents, DC pulled out the big guns to make Batman great again!!!!! This trade introduces the new Batgirl (the daughter of the deadly assassin Cain) and made every member of the Batman team shine!!! If you like Batman, or have ever liked Batman, you are certain to enjoy this great and affordable collection!!!"
4,Levelland,"I recently rented this movie, and like it a lot. I thought the story was cool, and some of the actors were really good. I really liked ""Nick"", and ""Betty"". those were my favorite characters, and their acting was really believable. Also, the soundtrack rocked. Whoever did it had great taste. Editing was a little off. I wish the story went more into the older brother and his friends instead of the WB looking guy. rock on"
1,A bad DVD,"I have been looking for this concert. But, although the cover is good, the DVD is very blurred. I ordered the VHS copy that had good reviews and now having a professional copy that to DVD for me. Not widescreen like this one but a much better and clean version to watch."
3,Doesn't support NTFS,"I got one of these as a refurb. It seemed like a solid piece of work with its metal case and in general, worked fine, but a couple of plastic parts died quickly and i couldn't get the backup or the read-from-usb function to work. However, it doesn't support drives formatted as NTFS, so if you're trying to recover drives from PCs with drives formatted that way, don't bother."
2,Not so Great,The cam connectors are thin and I broke two tightening this table. I had to go to Home Depot and get more. The pre-drilled holes were crooked and the cam connector holes were close to the edge of the shelf and caused the shelf to split upon tightening the cams.
3,Dedication,Amber is a woman dedicated to her job and all she wants from Joel Matheson are his paintings...not his attention. He's determined to break down her barriers she has erected against the world and convince her that love is worth the risk.
4,"A Truly ""Authentic"" Book from John Baxter","What a wonderful book this is. John Baxter shows us his real self and the things that matter the most to him. If you're interested in getting inside stories about the used and rare trade, this is the book for you! Filled with bits that are fascinating, funny, sad and all true."
2,disappointing,"I was terribly disappointed in this book. It's more of an autobiography of the author's life than it is about books and book collecting. Also, while I read more than the average person and I don't only read mainstream books, I felt like ""Pound of Paper"" was full of references to obscure authors.I would recommend ""Used and Rare"" and other books by Larry and Nancy Goldstone if you really want to read about books and collecting."
5,To God be the Glory,"WONDERFUL, every woman needs to read this book and purchase a copy for a friend.It gave me strengthen and encourgage me to want more out of my life. Now I strive for the best in my relationships and friendships. I know to look for potential growth in relationships, not just being in a relationship."
1,DONT BUY THIS,"I got in to the Euphoria series a couple years back and have been buying all the CD's in the series.So when I saw the tracklisting for this compilation I knew I had to add it to my collection.Unfortunately, the album is a MAJOR letdown.Not only is it mixed digitally, its mixed by Jay Burnett and he does a crap job. The tracks pitch and tempo are stretched and the audio quality is horrible.Maybe if it had been mixed by someone like Dave Pearce or Matt Darey this couldve been an amazing album..."
4,Would have worked but...,"This item would have worked. We put it on my daughters good arm to test it out and it was great... but because my 2 year old broke her fingers and had the full arm cast with her hand completely covered by the cast it just did not fit. Both me and my husband together tried to stretch it over her arm cast but it just would not work over the largest part of her hand. We actually got it over one time but because it has the glove part with the thumb her cast covered hand would just not fit and it made the whole cover too short to go over her whole arm cast. Then, when we tried to remove it, it was so tight that we thought we were going to crack her cast taking it off. I wish they made a model for the type of cast she has because if it would have fit over her hand this would have worked."
5,Great Pay Per View,"I would recommend this product to anyone who collects WWE dvds. The main event was good, and an overall good show."

4,Very satisfied,I was very pleased with these cards. I work in a child development center and bought these both for circle time and free play time and the kids love them. They'll sit around for twenty minutes looking over the pictures and showing them to each other. They've learned almost all the names and it's proved to be well worth the investment.
5,The Real Thing,"With so much music that is mislabeled as ambient, casual listeners suffer from misconceptions of what it actually is and from I can tell has completely sullied the genre as a result. This compilation is as much of what ambient music truly is about as much as compilations like ""Ambient Lounge"" completely misses the point. It captures not just the checklist of what makes ambient music what it is, but more importantly the ETHOS. What makes this compilation so fabulous is that it is amazing to listen to start to finish, but also that its contents are so remarkably diverse.This is an indispensable part of any music collection work its salt."
2,Very unhappy with this product,"These speakers were a major disappointment. I have speakers that are about 5 years old, and wanted to replace them. But these Sony speakers were AWFUL - the sound was tinny, the bass was almost non-existent, and the sound was probably worse than that coming from my built-in laptop speakers.And these weren't even the ""cheap"" speakers - there were many sets that cost less than this. If you care at all about the quality of the speakers, spend another $20-$30 and get a decent set... don't buy these..."
2,you get what you pay for,"these sound a lot better when i use the ""bass reducer"" in my equalizer. this is because there is megabass built-in but no knob with which to adjust or turn off that feature.altogether functional, and better than the speakers built-into my notebook, but not great."
1,Sony SRS-A202 really are poor,"I am not a hifist, but IMHO these speakers have very poor sound quality. Bass is lacking and sound is somehow distorted. I bought these for my work desktop, but I could not listen to these even 30 minutes. I am taking it back to the shop."
2,Mega Bass my BA**,"Well, they're not the WORST speakers ever made. I bought them looking for a cheap, crappy pair of speakers. Honestly though, I thought they'd be a little better.Tinny indeed."

4,Not sure,I bought this as a gift for my cousin. He hasnt gotten to use it yet. so I am hoping for the best!
1,"Seen in person, don't buy","I went to a cologne store and tested several scents, this being one of them. It smells like soap. if i wanna smell like soap then id buy a bar of Irish springs. it is an oil base so it will not mix with your natural body chemistry.what you smell is what you get"
1,Upset,They sent me a tainted version of the cologne. It smells horrible and the liquid appears darker than it normally should be. Worst part is I can't return it. What a waste of $20!
4,Smells Great!,The bottle is very large and the scent is great. I purchased this for a young man in college. This large bottle is good for the price and will last for awhile.
5,Smells YUMMY!!!,First pulled out this gift and sprayed it on my hand and smelled and was like.....UMM I dont really like it. Then after a few min of smelling it thought I might just keep it for my honey! I grew on me!
2,"The Eucharist,wine of faith,bread of life","I have found this book to be more basic and tutorial of what is church,church bells,etc.as in earlier Chapters. This would be a book for new converts to the Roman Catholic Church. If one is searching for a deeper love and meaning as the title indicates,The Eucharist, wine of faith and bread of life, one would need to search elsewhere. Basil Pennington is an excellent author, and has written many wonderful inspiring books, but this book lacks going beyond basics and tutorial, it reads like is bit Pre Vatican II and not as revised for the person in the year 2000 searching for a deeper and closer realtionship in the Eucharist."
4,Helpful,"I'm surprised at the negative reviews of this book. The PSAT has changed; reviewers may have been using an out-of-date edition, so who knows how accurate the reviews are now? As an author of standardized tests, I found this book to be a complete and helpful preparation guide for the new PSAT."
3,Filters,They don't fit exactly but stay in the cover for the most part. They'll be o.k. The container I ordered them for has been discontinued.
5,Perfect fit,The composter refills fit my Norpro composter bucket perfectly. There's really not anything else I can say about this product.
2,Best Fit - Best Price,"If you purchased the 1.5 Gallon Stainless Steel Kitchen Composter form either ""Norpro"" or ""RSVP"" the proper replacement filters, for the best price are the 2-pak ""BigKitchen - Large 2 Gallon"" ASIN: B002AB0N5Y for $8.95.The Norpro 84F (ASIN: B003PD9HBC) and 94F from ""Chef's Tools"" (ASIN: B0042YYCPY) from ""Chef's Pal"" are slightly smaller and more expensive. The Norpro 93F will never fit the 1.5 gallon composter. Also, the images can not be relied upon."
4,Works fine,The filter set appears to be working fine. The set includes a square filter and a round thing. I'm not sure if the round thing is also a filter or if it's just to hold the square filter in place in the lid. Installation was quick and easy and we've had no trouble with them.
4,Fun but Predictable,"Dido Hoare is an engaging heroine, with her protective retired father, her squalling baby, and her bookshop. The premise here is a fun one, pivoting on the provenance of a valuable book collection that includes original work by a modern American poet. But MacDonald does a poor job of setting up the mystery. Most readers should have it worked out by halfway through, yet Dido insists on ignoring red-flag clues that MacDonald dangles in front of her every few pages. It's a fun read, but a predictable one."
5,"Finally, a good Johnny Cash Book!","I purchased this book at the famed music book store, Helter Skelter in London May 2003. It is now available in the US. Very essential book if you really want to verify the cities and dates that Mr Cash performed over the course of his active touring career that ended in 1997. It is interesting to note the different type venues he performed in as his career went thru various stages of commercial appeal. There are also occaisional notations about particular shows. Finally, there are some very nice photos and reproductions of concert posters."
5,The Haunted Made Me Do What?,"The Haunted are back with a new vocalist, more energy, and an eclectic blend of hard-hitting metal riffs and screaming that will make even the most sane person let out their most inner frustrations. Featuring instant classics like 'Hollow Ground' and 'Bury Your Dead.'"
4,Good so far,"I have used the rotary tool for about a month now and it seems good. Strong motor, nice grip, feels solid. However, the included chuck has not been the best. The grinding tool that I use primarily vibrates loose on occasion. Also, the carrying case that comes with it is a joke. I have not tried to get or fit any accessories other than regular shafted bits. Bottom line, the tools seems very solid, but the accessories might need some work. Overall, good bang for the buck."
3,Accessories missing in package!,"From one of the reviews, the package was to come with the following. Those in brackets [ ]were those that were missing from my package. I returned the first, and on the re-order, I received exactly the same items....i.e. still missing. The package includes a picture of the accessories I was suppose to receive, but nope, it is not there anymore. Not sure if it is a QA issue with B&D.;Rotary Tool - 1Carrying Case - 1Woodworking Clamps - 2Wrench/Flathead Screwdriver - 11/8"" Standard Mandrel - 1Sanding Drum Mandrel - 1Rubber Polishing Wheel (Coarse) (Brown) - 1 [ MISSING ]Aluminum Oxide Stone Bullet (Brick) (For Grinding) - 1 [ MISSING ]Diamond Point (For Engraving) - 1 [ MISSING ]Heavy Duty Cut-Off Discs - 20Sanding Band (Coarse) - 3 [ MISSING, was supplied with 2 instead of 3 ]Sanding Band (Fine) - 2"
1,motor not worth it,motor burned out after second use. started smoking and stopped working after 1.5 hrs of use. will see how black and decker responds to repairs though.
1,Returned due to poor quality of packaging,"I received this order, and was very disappointed in a few things, all the fault of the manufacturer. I could not count 30 accessories, and some would not even fit - I think they may have included the wrong size. The one they included was the smaller one that the manual said was not common. There was no 1/8"" collett. And as others said, the ""case"" was a cheap plastic bag.I called B&D;, and the guy was totally unapologetic about it not being as advertised. I complained to Amazon, and they immediately credited me, even before I returned it, and before I had a chance for the seller not to return my email."
1,misrepresent included carry case,"did NOT come with a soft sided carry case and since i received my order yesterday the pics of the canvass looking carry case have been removedthis description is misleading or a down right lie ""soft-sided carry case with accessory compartment, user guide, and wrench"""
3,No Case,"I rarely review. Normally stuff I get from Amazon is as advertised. But I shoulda read more reviews before buying---the thing includes no case. And if ever there was a gizmo that needs a case? It's a rotary tool. So I returned it.That said, the basic tool is not half bad. It does work well. However, the '2.0amp' is a bit of hype. I compared it with a couple other tools which are in the 1amp range and it really didn't seem to make much difference in terms of cutting metal or polishing stone.If I were B&D; I would skip the included clamps---which are pointless, and add a -case- as shown, plus a few more accessories. Then it would be -excellent- value for money.BTW: I ended up getting a Neiko. Yeah, it has NO manual, but so far (a week) it hasn't felt 'flimsy' at all. Time will tell, but so far? Decent power---and the included flexible attachment makes it a steal.Oh and it has A CASE."
5,Best value !,"The rotary tool performs just great, I was shock with the quality of this tool since the first time I pull it out off the box.The accessories includes cut and sand disk, pretty basic. The clamps included are really strong and usefully.I will said 9 out of 10.Really happy with it!"
5,"Very thorough, lots of color photos!","This book mostly focused on mausoleums and unusual statuary, not very much on graves and/or headstones. It was very thorough without being boring at all. A GREAT feature was that every picture had a story right next to it with neat information - no searching around to find the text to go with the photo, or looking it up in an index in the back. I also liked the fact that 98% of the book focused on sites that you could find in the United States - only one or two of the sites were in Europe. A very interesting ""coffee table"" book which could easily interest others on this subject."
3,Not the battery that is in the picture,"After buying this battery, I almost fainted of shock after realizing that the battery was not as in the picture. It works, powers on my PSP and all, but in the picture it clearly shows a battery that has ""3.6v"" and a ""PSP"" logo on the bottom. When I recieved the battery that I bought, it came in a little box with a video camera picture on it. The battery was far from being the same one as in the picture. The battery has no trade mark or company logo on it and ,to get technical, it does not have a writable eeprom like the original Sony battery. After a day of usage, I also found out that the battery charge life was also far fetched from the original Sony battery.Viewers of this product take note before buying this product, as it is not the same product like in the picture and is far from being the same quality.This battery should only be look at as a last resort or if money is short and this battery is the only one you can afford."
5,Great Product,I have had these over a year now and they work Great!! They are hard to find but worth looking.
3,A new YANNI,I have been a fan of Yanni's for years until I ran across Bradley Joseph's music (Yanni's former keyboardist). If you like Yanni you will LOVE Bradley as he writes beautiful melodies and takes music were Yanni left off. Check him out at http;//www.bradleyjoseph.com
5,Best of Yanni,Dare to Dream and In My Time are Yanni's best instrumental albums and make my favorites list. Voces combines Yanni's genius with a variety of talented singers and also makes my list.
5,Silver Bullet,I Love this oldie but goody. I saw it when I was just a kid with my Dad for the first time and loved it right away. I was thrilled when I was able to find it at Amazon so I could finally own it. It's also important to me now because Corey Haim has passed away so now I will always have this with him in it.
1,This is NOT a good movie!,"""Silver Bullet"" is one of the most amateurish movies I have seen. It has no idea of whether it wants to be a horror film or a comedy, a looking-back narration or a present-tense thriller. It doesn't know where it is going, and tries to be everything all at once. As a result it is a mess with the very annoying Corey Haim- the lesser talented one of the two Coreys.It's not funny. It's not scary. It's narrated, at times, by Megan Fallows' character which makes no sense because she is just a minor character. Gary Busey can be a very effective and entertaining actor, but in ""Silver Bullet"" it looks like he was just collecting a paycheck to fuel his raging cocaine habit and that he was indulging in that habit on the set. He's a wreck! ""Silver Bullet"" ranks as one of the worst movies of the 80's, its only saving grace is that bad movie lovers might get a kick out of its awfulness. Did MST3000 ever do a show on this movie?"
2,Way Over Rated,"The size is very handy and it is easy to use. However, it does not bring out the colors very well at all. I would not buy it again and now I still have to buy a better one because this one is not as effective as I need it to be."
2,Way over priced !!,Although I learned to crochet with Bevs crochet video I was greatly disappointed with this knitting video. I thought that she would demonstrate how to do a lot of the different stitches the American way and because she knits usuing the Continental style I was completly thrown off. It seemed most of the video seemed to have a lot more to do with seeming and finishing than with more actual knitting stitches and could use more on changing colors. I am a new beginner and a great fan of Bev but I am just TOTALLY disappointed with this video. I think when you teach someone to knit you should show the person how to knit Continental AND American with All stitches. Not just Continetal all the way. After all it is supposed to be for beginners.I did learn a couple things from this video but I feel I should have learned more considering the huge cost of this tape. It's a rip off in MY OPINION. If I knew then what I know now. I would not have bought this video. Sorry Bev.
1,A Lite Confectionary,"Having been a Glass fan since Music in 5 Parts and a R. Shankar fan for even longer, I eagerly anticipated this collaboration. Individually, both Glass and Shankar challenged my listening in many directions. When Passages finally arrived, it was a real disappointment. This work challenged only my patience and ability to stay awake.Every two years or so I give it another listen to see if a new perspective emerges. It doesn't."

2,"Good glide, too chemically","Smell is a little talcum powderish. I don't like it. Glide is good, but the chemicals in this cream bother me a lot. I got some in my mouth by accident and it was ... yeeeccch. My new motto. ""If it can't go in your body, I'm not putting it on your body."" I'll not use this again."
1,Fragrance and preservatives make this a toxic cream,"This creme has a fragrance which is known to be toxic to humans.It also has a preservative that is highly toxic. Stick to UNSCENTED NO PRESERVATIVE CREAMS AND OILS TO BE SAFEI HAD A REACTION TO BIOTONEWhat are the reactions to iodopropynyl butylcarbamate allergy?Typical allergic contact dermatitis may occur. It may take several days after exposure to the allergen for symptoms to appear. Typical symptoms include redness, swelling, itching, and fluid-filled blisters. Patients commonly present with a scattered generalized dermatitis or dermatitis affecting hands and arms.Another concern of iodopropynyl butylcarbamate is that it may have adverse effects on the immune system. It is also suspected to be an environmental toxin. Further research into these areas is necessary."
4,Great product!,"Great massage creme to use for sore muscles,Is not overly greasy, no heavy scent.Product arrived promptly & packaged well."
5,A Must Have for the OT Student!!,M.B. Early is a great writer!! She makes the mental health area of OT easy to understand. She uses basic ideas and common terminology. This is a wonderful book for OT and OTA students. Early has really helped me to comprehend the mental health aspect. From an OTA student.
5,Sublime album,"I cannot really say why I love this album so much. Perhaps because I listened to it early in my very 1st years on getting into Electronic Music, maybe because it IS indeed a great album or perhaps because of the extraordinary cover art. Whichever the reasons are, I have to say this is one of the greatest and timeless E-M albums I've had and listened to in my already huge collection. Indigo is definately among O'Hearn's greatests, together with Eldorado and Rivers Gonna Rise. Highly recommended and an absolute must for every music fan."
3,Good but not new stuff,"Having read Miller's Proactive Sales Management (which I thought was excellent) I was keen to read his ideas on selling.I have to admit that I found this book had a lot less impact and many of the ideas have been put forward before by Bosworth, Rackham, Thull, Sandler and others. There's nothing wrong with the notion that you should see things from the prospect or customer point of view and that communication should be in their terms - or indeed that the process of selling should be controlled in an intelligent and proactive sense.But I did find some of the concepts (such as 'buyers look back, salespeople look forwards') to be a potentially dangerous assumption in some industries, such as technology.So, if you have not had much sales training or have not read many sales books don't let me spoil it for you. If you have, you may find yourself thinking you have heard the concepts before, but the words sounded different."
3,"Sturdy, but too much treble","This boom box is well made, but it hurt my ears. Seriously, this thing needs a subwoofer. Even with the Mega Bass on, it's too treble. It's like it has only two settings: high pitched and higher pitched. I'm a big fan of bass, so I like to hear that deep sound as the foundation of the music. I didn't hear it with this unit. I returned mine and got a boom box with a subwoofer. If you don't care about the bass or the ability to adjust the sound beyond two settings, this box might be fine for you."
1,Horrible,This book was depressing. Unless you want to read what you have done wrong don't bother to buy this book. Only buy this book if you want to fix your marriage the Christian way - prayer and scripture. I had so much hope that this book was going to give me some real steps to helping myself but really it was a bust. I through it in the circular file after reading the chapter on love!
1,Hoping for more than one star,"Bought this today, and the first shot went well. I overshot the target, but was otherwise in line.As others have mentioned, it takes two people to put the bow together. This step did not bother me.The materials look and feel good, and the engineering seems well worth the $20 I paid.The trouble is, I could not get the thing to fire a bold again after the initial shot. Each time I fired, the arrow was stuck in the groove and the string went under and past the arrow as it fired.I am looking at this in awe. It looks like a decent ""toy"". But it simply has some kind of design flaw.I will keep hoping to fire it again. And I will return and give it two stars or more if I can figure it out.I guess I would say try to avoid the attraction to the price, and save yourself a headache."
5,Declan Galbraith CD-'Thank You' review,"This CD contains songs that Declan Galbraith 'covered' that were originally from other artists, such as the BEE Gee's. Declan has the voice of a little angel. He can hit high notes and hold them with control that most adults can only wish to have. This young man's music is very soothing and pleasant. I would encourage anyone to at least try Declan's music. The only drawback is that Declan has not been released in the United States, so you have to order his music from a company that can get it from the U.K. I used Marion's Music and you can email a request[...], I also used CDZone-UK to order one for a friend. Robert B."
2,Ear Phone jack failed after a year.,I liked the system as long as every thing worked - I now have it sitting in a closet - costs over $100 to replace jack!Any one need any parts????
2,disappointing,"great song list, yet the samples sound as though they are rushing through the set. at first I was thrilled for another live samples set, only to be disappointed by the result. stick with transmission for your live samples cd."
4,sparta review,"even with a new drummer, sam young of the winebottles, the samples continue to express their music integrity through soaring harmonies and backbeats as melodic as the lyrics themselves. although this album represents another take on previously released material as well as two new songs (landing on the sidewalk and water under the bridge, the album itself evidences superb musicianship in an ever-changing industry. with songs like 'feel us shaking' and 'giants', the idea is clear: folky-pop hooks that grab you and have you always wanting more from one of the best bands to emerge from the boulder,CO scene."
1,DON'T BOTHER,"Yes this battery was inexpensive, but it runs the camera for less than 30 minutes.Not worth anything. Don't bother with this one."
1,BEWARE,"Beware, this item is child size. Bought it for my daughter-in-law and instead gave it to her 5 year old daughter. It is tiny. With the exception of two sharp objects I would call it a toy."
3,Garden Tote Tool Set,"The box that the product came in was very tattered with frayed edges. It looked as if it had been stored on a shelf in a very dusty room. However, the product arrived on time."
3,Medieval Tapestries Coloring book,"I was annoyed to be charged twice for shipping and handling, especially when both coloring books arrived in one package.The book itself is excellent - very close to the original art - so it will be useful to me for details of dress and ornamentation."
4,This was a hit with my teenager!,"Item arrived quickly and as mentioned in the title, was a hit with my teenage son."
2,:l,"If you like to read about degenerated characters, read it. I can't believe I wasted my money on it. I'm thinking about burning it."
4,If you like more of the same...,"...which I do, then you'll be OK here. Most of the CD is comprised of new studio renditions of old songs. There are, I believe, two original songs which are great. Feel us shakin' sounds as good as usual, as do Little Silver Ring, As Tears Fall, Information, We all move on, etc. On a side note, I caught a copy of this CD from the lead singer Sean Kelly, who threw out a few during a show in Austin. I also met him before they went on; really nice guy. Enjoy the CD, which is as close to a greatest hits as the Samples have done yet."
5,10 month old loves it,"This is the best cartoon I've come across, both for kids and adults. My 10 month old loves it, always keeps her interest. Yet it's not loud and obnoxious, no annoying songs or fast scene changes, so it isn't a bother to have on in the background. Simple and calm! 5 stars for sure! Sad that it won't be offered free on Prime anymore."
4,Give it time...,"I actually had to read this one twice before I liked it. I'm going to blame myself for that. I loved Tinker, and was jazzed when Wolf Who Rules was finally released, so I read it very quickly the first time, and almost immediately lost the plot. I was so disappointed, I re-read Tinker, just to remind myself how really great it was, then forced myself to go slowly, and read Wolf Who Rules again. The second time, everything fell into place.The elves look human but their culture is so very alien, the shocks and surprises in this book happen without warning. The story takes place only days after the first book ends, and Tinker is having to get used to her new body and her emotional reactions after being finally saved from the Oni. The good guys are not always good, the bad guys are not always bad, and the wacky dreams Tinker is having are adding to the confusion.It is a wonderful book, but not an easy one. Read it slowly, give yourself time to enjoy it, you won't be disappointed."
2,Stretching for Seniors with Ann Smith,"Disappointed. This DVD is not for me. Too many exercises sitting on the floor, and I can't do that anymore. Am 83 and have had both hips replaced so cannot sit on floor anymore. Would like to return this DVD(only watched one time) and replace it for another with standing Stretching. Is this posible? I didnot Keep the package it came in.Awaiting your reply. Thank you."
1,DISAPPOINTED,"I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it. I watched it all the way through first and haven't really tried it yet, but it seems to be more ballet than instruction."
1,"QuickBooks Pro 2004 brings ""slop-ware"" to the forefront.","My company was ""sunsetted"" by Quickbooks so we had to upgrade. Pretty much everything went wrong. The install loaded spyware on our computer and overwrote many of our security settings. You have to have Internet Explorer set to ""medium security"" even if you don't use QB 2004 on the internet. Riddled with internal ""adware"" and ""buy-me"" where you think help menus might be. Don't use this version if you have a choice. Take a look at PeachTree.The good news is that the very basic functions still work and that most of the useless and annoying ""enchancements"" can be turned off or gotten around."
3,Rebate Info--Don't Be Fooled,"Note that the $100 Rebate is for UPGRADES only. It is a bit deceiving when you purchase your QuickBooks, it is for those who had previous versionsof QuickBooks only."
1,"Save your money, don't buy it",The Canadian version is full of bugs. Customer service is not helpful but will always try to sell you other products or technical support instead of fixing the problem.They do not respond to e-mail. Tax table does not update.Save your money and don't buy the software. The problems are too many to list.
1,Very poor performance in a multi-user environment,"I purchased QuickBooks but now when my business grows and we want to use it in a network the performance decrease so much. I think it is only for very small businesses that do not need to grow! I think this is the main reason people do not like QuickBooks anymore. Look for accounting software which grows as your business grows, don't get locked in this software. Do not waste your time entering all these data in a program which will have a big performance problem."
5,Smoky jazz Etta.,I bought the CD for a friend but downloaded a copy - minus a few tracks - from iTunes. I first heard Etta's version of My Funny Valentine in the middle of a restless night. I've never heard anything quite like Etta's voice. I'm at a loss for words but Etta's interpretation of these jazz standards blow me away every time I listen to them.It may not be for you if you're into her edgier blues style. I find this the flavor of this CD stands apart as unique in her discography with an after hours jazz club feel. Etta's interpretive skill and abilty to dig in and own a tune are amazing. Some voices suffer as they age. Etta's only getting better. A bucketload of soul.
1,Like learning through examples that don't work?,"While one of the cheapest JavaScript books out, you get what you pay for: irritating fonts for script examples; spacing in scripts is not consistent; script example numbering falters. Yet the most irritating aspect is about 1/3 of the example scripts--up to Chapter 7, by which time I gave up on this book--don't work with Netscape 3.0+ as advertised. If learning through flawed examples--the error messages that pop up aren't exactly helpful for novices, either--is your chosen pedagogical approach, buy this; if you think instructional texts should be well edited to be largely devoid of errors, avoid this one. Peachpit Press has assured me by private email that corrections and expansions have been made in the second edition, which is actually cheaper--curious. The above statements are purely my own."
4,Good but not perfect,"I ordered four of these cables and though I was quite satisfied with the build quality, I was going to use them to run SDI out from my camera to an SDI to HDMI converter box. They needed to lay on the floor flat and did not. It looks like these may be solid core wires, more appropriate for stapling to a wall or baseboard. Were that my purpose, they would have been fine but as is, I needed a more flexible cable and sent them back."
5,A sailing manual that you'll use for years.,"A book that's useful for both the novice and the experienced sailor, one that's really worth the space it takes up onboard. Filled with info that we refer to on every cruise, yet also beautifully illustrated and fun to browse at home. The Staneks - Chicago, IL"
4,It looks nice,"I just purchased this book, my class uses Mosby's book.. I don't care for that book and I only glanced through this one... It looks nice, I just wish I would have read these reviews first"
2,Wishy Washy,"I found this book helpful in some aspects, but it definetly condradicts itself all over the place. In one place, it says that neonatal compressions are to be 5:1 and in another place it says 3:1 - as for my class tests, my teacher used the test manager that came with it, AND we learned 3:1, so I knew that was the answer, but nationally, when I write my certification exam, I dont know what they want to see, because my text book didn't teach me much! It was really easy to look up definetion and the algorithms were good and such...as well as the pictures from actual (or simulated) paramedic calls. But as for the contradictions and spelling mistakes, I can't give this book a very good rating. I highly suggest you invest in another book, it just isnt worth buying this book."
1,was there even an editor for this book?,"This book is FULL of errors, it contridicts itself constantly, and over some very important issues. I would not recommend this book to anyone who is serious about this field. A basic word processor would have caught more errors than the editor did. I feel that if I would have used this book alone (without purchasing additional books from another source) that I would definatly NOT be prepaired to sit for National Registry."
2,Master of the Obvious,"This book was a very easy read...because the writers kept repeating themselves. I feel like I wasted my money on the book. I would recommend ""Parenting with Love and Logic"" if you are looking for a solution to nagging your kids. I love their outlook."
3,"Another strong effort, and I like it!!!","Hey the title sums it all up. This album will take alittle while for the listener to get used to, but that is because the Stones started to change their sound from the BEGGARS BANQUET to EXILE ON MAIN ST. days. This album has an excellent cover of AINT TO PROUD TO BEG which does justice to the original. The title track is a song that will forever be a mandatory classic rock staple. IF YOU CANT ROCK ME is a good down and dirty rockin song that helpes to kick the album off. TIL THE NEXT GOODBYE is a good heart-felt ballad that shows Mick's vocal talents. TIME WAITS FOR NO ONE has a funky, jazzy sound to it that actually is a diamond in the rough off this album. DANCE LITTLE SISTER is a good rockin song that will get you dancing and is another good song that hasnt really been given its due. I gave this album 3 stars, but it is actually closer to 3 1/2 and I think any rock fan will enjoy this"
5,Rolling Stones Are the Greatest band ever.,"You Know I am a long time Stones fan and it has been a blast to put my collection back together with the Remasters.I think if you really like the Stones you cant go wrong with this disk.the first 5 songs are Awsome If you can't rock me and ain't to proud are classics and next goodbye and time waits just flow putting you in a relaxing and retrospective mood.I thing this cd kicks ass, Luxury and dance little sister areclassics as well. you can play this cd from start to finish and let it restart it's that good. Stones are the best , you won't regret this. buy it it's great."
4,"""Right Now, Somebody, is Listenin' to.....You""","My favorite Rolling Stones song is on this album: ""Fingerprint File"". What I really love about this song is how the instruments seem to all be playing apart and still go together so well. The bass in this song is my favorite. ""It's only Rock 'n Roll (But I like it)"" really sounded great in the summer of '74. This album followed ""Goats Head Soup"" and although I like Goats Head better the albums compliment each other well. The Stones 60's sound is definitely gone here, but nothing lasts forever. This is probably their last album that has a total rock & roll sound."
4,Betty Trenka is a good read,"I have enjoyed both Betty Trenka books very much. While I like the catchy titles of the Lady Priam series, I couldn't get into them. Perhaps it's because I personally identify with Betty. I'm hoping Ms. Christmas will devote more writing time to bring us future Betty Trenka books"
2,Not that great,"This book is not very good. It basically repetes the same information many times. For example, it gives the species descriptions twice, but only has about five sentances on a proper cage for a conure. Even w/ the descriptions, it didn't talk about the specific conures traits and personality, only how big it is and where it can be found in the wild. Not even if it is readily available as a pet or if that species is on the verge of extinction, therefor you can not make any judgement at all, wheather that bird will make a good pet. I have read many parrot books and the is nothing specificly on conures in this one. In my opinion, the author just wrote about parrots in general, replacing the word ""parrot"" with the word ""conure"". The only interesting thing in this book was the pictures which gave it the extra star, otherwise it would have only gotten one."
2,Not for the average Joe,"I have to agree with most of what's been said here. I have two wonderful hand-reared black-tailed conures as pets - now this species is virtually unheard-of in captivity, so I bought this book on the strength of the 'detailed species descriptions' advertised. What a slap in face! Apparently my birds are simply 'similar to maroon-bellied conures, but ...not as interesting' (exact quotation). The book is written from a breeder's point of view, and a breeder stuck two decades ago for that matter. There is a strangely impersonal tone to the whole book, which some pet owners who don't see their birds as liquid assets may find off-putting. I certainly did. However, the many photos are good, which earns it the extra star."
1,Totally dated and unhelpful,"This book, as well as almost all the Barron's pet books, are really nothing but photos which are pretty and scanty information that is not even accurate in many ways. Many are written by Europeans back in the 90s or early 2000s and continue to promote poor diets, dated caging suggestions and often ignore other vital issues of husbandry such as enrichment and foraging opportunities, the necessity of flight, and the reality and need to manage behavioral issues such as territorial aggression which is often a problem with conures. All the Barron's bird books also go heavily into and are supportive of breeding which in this day and age is unethical given the thousands of conures being dumped on parrot rescues across the country. Don't waste your money or valuable time on this book....go online and find out how to properly care for your conure from updated websites that cover the challenges and requirements of conure ownership and not just the bare minimum."
2,Tray did not open,"First off, I purchased this because of all of it's features and sleak design. However, when I received the unit and pushed the eject button, the tray got stuck. Looks like the tray is misaligned and one corner of it interferes with the face. I purchased this from North Star Electronics who tests all of their units to be region free which means that at one time or another the tray would have been opened in order to test it. Upon speaking with the customer service rep, he believes that it was working when it left North Star, but probably got damaged during shipping. Not sure what to believe but it was disappointing because I now have to pay to have it shipped back for an exchange. I wish they build electronics like they used to."
5,A book for your heart,"""Most of time men have worded their prayers in their own languages. However, the finest prayers are the ones worded by ALLAH Himself and mentioned in the Qur'an. This book compliles such divine prayers, explains the back ground of revelation and stresses on the importance of such prayers in our daily lives. prophets and their followers invoked these prayers, which were accepted by ALLAH."""
4,A hint of the old days,"TD seemed to hearken back to their 70s output with White Eagle. Most of the ""songs"" on this album are of considerable length and comprise several ""themes"" or ""movements"" that seemlessly segue from one to the other.Many fans of the band's 70s releases (myself included) no doubt appreciated this ""return to roots"" of a sort, but the band still displayed their ability to move forward with their music as well as the synthesizer technology used to create it.The music is very spacey and atmospheric. Chris Franke's sequencer work is very solid, although not spectacular, and most of the tunes heard on this album are extremely memorable and have stood the test of time.This is a very good release from the band during the Froese, Franke, Schmoelling lineup that rivals the classic lineup of Froese, Franke, Baumann."
4,It has a lot of feeling.,"I like the hole cd, but my favorite songs are, ""Enamorado de un Fantasma"" and "" La Mujer de los Dos."""
4,The Stones 70's version of ' Revolver',"I think this review title captures this album's mentality, as it shows the band experimenting, whether intentionally or not as they auditioned guitar players to replace Mick Taylor, with a wide variety of music styles, almost as many as 'Exile.' After all, you have disco on 'Hot Stuff' and 'Hey Negrita,' funk on 'Crazy Mama,' reggae on 'Cherry Oh Baby,"" lounge jazz on ""Melody,"" the ballad on ""Fool To Cry"" and ""Memory Motel,"" and out-and-out rock on ""Hand of Fate."" And like Revolver it's a bit of a fulcrum piece for the band, not as lousy as '74's bloated 'It's Only Rock n' Roll,' yet not as focused at '78's ""Some Girls."" And at eight songs it has a portability akin to 'Let It Bleed.' ""Crazy Mama"" is a bit of a cruddy finish, but this record has its charms. And that cover, with zoned-out Keith muttering in tired Mick's ear, perfectly confirms the title 'Black and Blue' as the state of a band jadedbut soldiering on..."
2,Forgettable,"I have bought all of the Rolling Stones' records at one time or another, and I just love their classic 60s and early 70s albums. But I did end up throwing two Stones CDs away the last time I went through my overstuffed CD shelves, and this was one of them.""Black And Blue"" is a bland, sadly uninspired collection of mediocre funk, soul, reggae and pop-rock, and to me it is a stylistic experiment gone wrong, and probably the Stones' most forgettable record. It is certainly a far cry from the tough rock and blues they played in the 60s and early 70s (and in the 90s for that matter), and the only song worth notice, ""Memory Motel"", can be found in a very fine rendition on the live ""No Security"".This one is only for completists. Well, maybe not. I'm a bit of a Stones completist myself, and I threw it away. I'm not really sure who it's for, then."
2,Lazy,"Eight songs: one of which is a lame cover of an old reggae tune (""Cherry Oh Baby""), two of which are misguided attempts at DiscoFunk (""Hot Stuff"" and ""Hey Negrita"") -- a genre that the Stones wouldn't master until the ""Some Girls"" album two years later. That leaves just five others, which vary from rote (""Crazy Mama"") to pointless (""Melody"") to overly-mannered (""Fool to Cry""). Two stars, tops."
3,"Last Dance From the ""Old Stones""","Even though this album is uneven in its quality, it marks the final point where the Stones remained a valid band. From this album on, it seemed to me that every new record and new tour, just seemed to remind me that this band had declined and nothing would ever be the same again."
5,Zamtastic!!!!,"I've always been an admirer of the pan flute, but then again who isn't? If you are looking for the best at picking up ladies wearing chest waders and an men's evening fur, you look to the nook. If you are looking to the master of the pan flute, you look no other place than Zamfir. Evidentally, Zamfir is pretty busy because he just took ABBA album cover from ABBA Gold and used it for his album, but that doesn't take away from the pure genius of the man's music. I don't expect Zamfir to design album covers just like I don't expect J abs to reach things in high places with his T rex arms. I expect Zamfir to turn tha mutha out on the pan flute and he does that. I'm a little disappointed his cover of ""Tubthumping"" by Chumbawumba didn't make the cut, but I'm sure there is another gold collection coming. If you want top o the line pan fluting, this is your album."
5,Very satisfied,"Bought this shoes for my boyfriend, and he loved them and arrived at his house in time. Thanks"
5,my 5 year old,"he is talking to them like pets,He puts it in the bed with him.I like that its soft and cuddely."
4,Great for Kids,This toy is perfect for kids to visualize they have a real pet. Recommended for pet lovers.
3,Very small,"It is smaller than I expected. But still cute.I'm sure my youngest will love it.Very soft, and cuddly.Will be buying more webkin pets in the future."
5,Great gift,"The stuffed animal came very quickly, was precisely what was described, a great gift for any animal lover! A little smaller than imagined but in perfect condition."
3,Long suffering Agatha and Dear Reader,"Although this book was a tad more cohesively written than the ""wellspring of death"", and the reappearance of Charles is less numbing than James, I, too am eager for Agatha to grow into a more self-aware and self-possessed woman. As a successful business-woman, she is entitled to more confidance about her own qualities and abilities, and if feels out-of-character for her to be so insecure about her person and her worth."
5,Great book!,"I have now read all of the Agatha Raisin books, except the newest one, and I enjoyed them all!"
4,Mystery Solver,"As with all of the Agatha Raisin stories, the minute you open up the book you find yourself on yet another wonderful journey through the beautiful Cotswolds and Agatha's unabashed determination to get to the bottom of the latest mystery.I never stop enjoying these mysteries, the character of Agatha Raisin is so believeably female and tons of fun.Once you read one, you cannot stop until you have enjoyed them all."
3,Not Mrs. Raisin's best,"This book was not as dismal as the last Agatha Raisin mystery but it isn't much better. I could not get involved with the plot or feel any connection to the characters. M.C. Beaton seems to have forgotten what made Agatha Raisin such an endearing heroine. I felt in this one that Agatha herself was the murderer as she caused the murder to happen due to her boredom. I hate to give up on the series but this one didn't cause me to want to keep reading them. And please, let's return Aggie to the woman of the 90's that she is and resolve this mess with James once and for all! I hope the Hamish McBeth series doesn't take the same nosedive as this one did."
3,Nice book - but Kindle version is full of errors,"I am a great fan of Agatha Raisin and enjoyed reading this book. However, the kindle version is full of language errors. Really irritating! Makes me wonder whether anyone proofreads the kindle versions."
4,Very Good,All the matches leading up to the main Event were Extremely Well Done.The only problem I had with the Title match was Hogan having to use a foreign object to win.This was the second greatest SuperBrawl of all time.The no 1 is 8
2,NOT THAT GOOD,I liked the syxx and melenko match but the rest of ot kind of boring. What i didn`t is when savage whopps gotta see it. but not that good
4,Great book ...,"The book is terrific ... I just want to know what a ""dress reversal"" is - as mentioned by a previous reviewer. Maybe I missed something!!"
3,"Not too bad, but not spectacular","This was my first camera, and I got a cheap one cuz I was going off to college and would like to send pictures home. I like that the camera is compact, and it does take pretty good pictures, but the double flash confuses people and so the picture might come out a bit blurry. And if it's not held perfectly still, the picture could come out pretty blurry, too.When the light isn't perfect or very bright, the screen is pitch black and I usually have to eyeball and aim for where the subject of my picture was.It's a good camera on a budget, but 3.0MP isn't that great quality in general. The pictures usually turn out better/more normal when they're uploaded.Overall... it's got some pros and cons for sure, but... use your better judgment. =) I don't recommend NOT getting it, but I'm not raving about it."
2,junk,I bought this player for my kids to watch in the car on road trips and it lasted about 2 months before it died. The Polariod Co. doesn't stand behind it either. You get what you pay for this was not a wise choice.
1,CRAPPY HINGE TURNS PLAYER INTO PAPER WEIGHT,"The hinge design on this player sucks. There is one friction clutch on the left hinge, and just a guide on the right. As a result, the left hinge will spontaneously break leaving you with several hundred dollars worth of a paper weight.PIECE OF JUNK....DO NOT BUY!The engineers who designed that hinge are MORONS! (I hope they see this) I hope Polaroid fires you and I hope you suffer spontaneous breakage of products you spend your hard earned money on due to someone else's STUPID DESIGN."
1,DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT !,"Don't be fooled by the Polaroid Name, It means nothing !!!This might as well be a disposal product because it WILL NOT last! And when it breaks, and it will, don't waste your time with customer service, it's a joke.Purchasing this product is as good as flushing $200. Read All the Reviews this many people can't be wrong."
1,After 90 warranty you can't even pay to have it fixed.,"At first I was very happy with this player, until the screw holding the thing you snap the dvd onto fell out. I called to see if I could buy the part . They do not offer parts or repair, even if you offer to pay for it after 90 days. You have to buy a new unit at a discounted price. The discounted price was almost as much as the original price. I would not buy this product again."
5,Great gadget,"this player is great. It playes all sorts of disks, has great sound and video quality and is lightweight. Great for long flights and car trips. A investment I do not regret."
3,Not That Bad,"I bought this portable dvd player in early october 2003. It is now late May 2004.Its been fine all this time. I really liked it. The only problem until now that I really encountered was that if a dvd was in there for too long it would begin to freeze. Also when I got it it was 300 dollars. Now its 230. My main problem that I encountered was that a few weeks ago the hinge cracked in half. It is still functional but The screen wont stay in place and if I dont fix it, the screen will probably fall off. They had pretty good customer support because after I send this to them they will fix the system for me. Be cautious of the problems Ive warned you for and I'd have to reccomend this."
3,Good product for the price,"If you are looking for an entry level portable dvd player this is the way to go. It get's the basics done, keeps the kids quiet in the back seat. It does not have a lot of bells and whistles. The sound without headphones is very low, could not hear a thing in the car, ,but with the headphones on it is much better. Picture quality is average, although the settings out of the box are horrible. Everyone looked orange and any text was very fuzzy around the edges. You are able to fix most of this is you play with the adjustments. One thing I must say, on a 12 hour road trip we did not have one DVD skip the entire time.Overall I am happy with this product. I was not looking to spend a lot of money on one of these players and I feel the Polaroid has met my expectations. Only paid $229 at BestBuy for a brand new one."
2,bought it for my niece,"Worked for 6 months. Sister used it only on long trips in the car or airplanes. Broke, now only plays Audio CD's. Won't buy another portable again, waste of $$"
2,No sound after 8 months!,"Bought this unit at Walmart and LOVED IT for 8 months. Then the sound went out. I called Polaroid and was informed of the 90 day policy! That sucks! Thank God for my husband who NEVER throws electronic boxes away, I retuned it to Walmart for a full refund. Beware of this product!"
1,Junk & Double JUNK,"My daughter recieved this player as a Christmas gift in 2004. She used it maybe 4 time in 2 weeks then it quite playing, no preview screen, no sound, no nothing, and on top of that the DVD door latch broke when i was trying to figure out what was wrong.Wish I would have read some of the reviews on this product before we purchased it.I recently traded it in on a Magnavox MPD720 picture is better and has all the same accessories and functions as the Polaroid and then some, cost is a little more ($239.00) but you probably get what you pay for."
2,Little To Offer,"This book, written by Chuck Norris in 1975, the year he retire from sport karate competition, has very little to offer the karate student. The book doesn't have much material in written information, but instead, relies on still photography to teach the karate student certian sport karate techniques, such as entry techniques and striking drills. Overall, the book is a very weak presentation on point fighting.I highly admire Chuck Norris and if one would rather read books authored by him they should read ""The Secret Power Within"" or his autobiography. These books are informative and at times, insightful. If someone is looking for a good book on sport karate and how to improve their sparring skills, I highly recommend the superior book ""American Freestyle Karate"" by Dan Anderson."
1,Horrible reaction,"I wish I could show you a photo of what I look like right now. Quasimodo is a great description. Ive used this mascara before without any problems in years past. This time when I bought a brand new tube, my eyes immediately got irritated. At first I thought it was my eyeshadow which Id had for a while. I replaced it, and was still getting red, puffy eyes. I feel like I have cuts along my eyelids and they are so dry and itchy. Ive used aquafor to keep the moisture in with hydrocordisone cream over that to keep the itch down. It honestly is the most miserable thing ever and they need to pull this product from the shelf. Its easy to say that this shouldnt get bad reviews just because IVE had an allergic reaction, but Ive used this product before with no issues. The company has changed something in the formula to make it this way.....its horrible!"
1,Severe reaction,"I never write reviews but I have to warn others..... do not use this! I just found out what has been causing my eyelid horror and it is this! Itchy, red, scaling eyelids and under the eye.. worst thing ever!"
4,Near Classic,Lots of classic tunes you know from radio and parties. Many have written here it was their last great studio album. Maybe so. Check out Slave.
1,Upset,Too much stuff on Amazon is just pure false adverstising.I purchased this remaster and received the 94 version.Truly bogus!In reality it's more of a pain to return than keep.I've had the albums and now am out slowly converting everything over to disc.I thought I was getting the 09 remaster.Again watch yourself people.
2,Too Sweet!,Sometimes a cereal over compensates on the fake sweetner to try to make the cereal taste better and this is one of those times.
1,Orthomolecular Hogwash,"I'm disappointed to see this book still sold. This book covers an approach which Dr. Abram Hoffer and others developed in the 1950s, but which by the 1970s was proven to be fruitless. The work of Dr. Hoffer and others is discussed in detail in the American Psychiatric Association Task Force Report, July 1973, which points out methodological flaws in the early work and reviews later studies which failed to show any benefit for such treatments.In recent years, new medicines, with improved side-effect profiles and techniques to overcome problems with social and occupational functioning, have been well proven advances for the treatment of schizophrenia. Early intervention programs should prevent some of the serious dysfunction of the disease.Serious illnesses like schizophrenia require proven treatments. Vitamin treatments as ""alternative"" therapy for schizophrenia should not be recommended."
3,Despite My Emotional Attachment - Only 3.5 Stars,"I am the Stones Authority. This is a nostalgic favorite simply because of the time of its release and what was going on at that time in my life. But it is not a heavy weight album. It is whimsical. It is fun, but there is not a lot to it and not a lot to remember about it. It is easy to listen to and inoffensive, but this isn't one of the albums you reach for when you are introducing someone to the band. I do have to say, however, that the sax and vocal solo/interlude in the song Emotional Rescue is a wonderful Stones moment and manages to redeem a rather silly song. I do still listen to it though, and it reminds me of a fun and uncomplicated time. A whimsical summer before real life began."
4,Old Stones Fan Just Discovered 80s Stuff,"Probably like a lot people, I stopped buying the Stones LPs after Some Girls. I can't actually say why. Sabbath split, Blondie split, Keith Moon died and the Who may as well have split. John Bonham, ugh. Maybe I thought they'd seen their day. Maybe this LP and their 80s Lps didn't get enough airplay. Maybe I thought I outgrew them. But by this time in 1980, I don't recall having any passion for them anymore. I liked the title cut here. I remember Down in the Hole as a great b-side on the juke box. Still no desire to hear the album. Recently I purchased all five 80s CDs, Emotional, Tattoo, Dirty Work, Undercover and Steel Wheels. Put all five in the CD shuffle and I heard Stones I didn't know existed. It was like discovering them all over again 20 and more years later. If like a lot of people, you gave up on the Stones in the 70s. Check this stuff out. It's a new experience. I actually like it all better than Goatshead-to-Some Girls era."
2,"Getting into something new? Uh, no","This is a mixed bag indeed; a return to the scattergun approach, laden with session musicians, of the Goat's Head Soup or Black And Blue days. In a sense it's a little too calculated as the followup to Some Girls, except that the songwriting's not nearly as strong (and some of the best things cut at the sessions were held over for Tattoo You). Not that there's not some good stuff here. Dance Part One is a stomping Soulfinger-like R&B (semi-) instrumental; Down In The Hole a tortured blues; She's So Cold still amuses (Jagger's frustrated vocal as he sings about his frigid girlfriend is extremely funny); and All About You, Keef's barroom ballad/kissoff to Anita Pallenberg and heroin, is oddly moving. And yes, the title track -- electric piano, silly falsetto, weird rap and all -- still sticks to the ear like poop to a blanket. There's a lot better Stones albums to spend your money on than this one, though."
2,AN ALBUM TO FORGET,"If you're a ROLLING STONES completist, then you must buy this album. If yoú wanna have only the cream of Stones, then this is the last album to buy. Simple as that."
1,Bottom of the barrel Stones,"This is just not a good album. It has one really energetic song, ""Where The Boys Go"", but even that one isn't really a classic or anything. The rest is tired, dull, an off day at the office for the group. I say ""at the office"" because it sounds like they are going through the motions at their work."
1,Stones stumble and no rescue in sight,"Throughout most of the late mid to late 70's and 80's the Stones were resting on their laurels. They didn't break any new ground and the music seemed to be a recyling of all their old riffs or subject matters. Generally, the best way to describe Stones albums during this period is good beat, bad music.Emotional Rescue is probably the nadir of Stones records. While they would record songs as bad as any on this album, future albums wouldn't be quite as lacking in inspiration and writing. Even Richard's guitar playing sounds like it is play by numbers.About the only redeeming value of this disc is Charlie Watts' playing. His playing snaps and makes even the most unlistenable Stones songs(and, to be fair, there are a load of those for every classic Stones song), tolerable.Not the worst Stones album, but certainly nothing to be proud of, either."
2,I knew from the first that this was the worst...,"Absolute crap. It seems in the 80's,the Stones always had to humor Jagger with at least one piece of disco garbage per LP, and ""Dance Part 1"" is the worst. (""Part 2"" appears on a couple of compilations and maybe a 12"" disco single.)It does have a kinda cool cover and two decent tunes, the blues ""Down In The Hole"" and the hit ""She's So Cold"", a rocker with a clever, politically incorrect, lyric. On the whole, comparable to other mediorcities of the era,such as ""Dirty Work"" and ""Steel Wheels""."
2,Worst Stones studio album of all time.,"This is it. The big stinkeroo. The album that takes the title of the worst Stones studio album of all time, in my opinion. The title track is an embarrassment, the attempts at funk-influenced disco are flaccid jams with no content, Keef's ballad offering is a joke, and you have a ridiculous Mariachi horn-influenced lament from Mick titled ""Indian Girl"" that makes no sense lyrically or, if it does at all, it is a very feeble attempt at explaining Latin-American influenced political conflict. Elsewhere, the few rockers are leftovers from the 'Some Girls' sessions and you can see why they were not picked for that album -- with the exception of one success story (the fabulous ""Let Me Go""). Save your money on this one. The 1980's was not a pretty decade for the Stones, and this wretched release set the tone for what was to follow (although they rebounded nicely with 1981's 'Tattoo You', but most of the songs on that album were leftovers from the '70's)."
1,NOT A TONER CARTRIDGE,Be careful of this one! The title states this is a High Yield Toner Cartridge but the 39V1645 is for a Photoconductor Kit! 39V1642 is the Toner Cartridge so don't believe what you read until you read the fine details! Buyer Beware!
5,There Is A Law,Excellent summation of Cosmic Principles which provide better understanding of guidelines for self discipline for souls seeking personal growth within the greater Cosmic Realms.Rev. Hope V. Naylor was a truly inspired author who exemplified self discipline in her daily life and inspired those around her to reach inward and upward toward Christ Consciousness in Love absolute.
5,Loved the diversity of material,"Images of Eternal Joy: Moments with Yogiji Maharaj was a great read, specifically because the material was really engaging. First, off much of the writing about Yogiji Maharaj by his disciples was extremely poetic. The language was definitely inspirational. I also really appreciate the different stories from his life. When you read about he would lock himself in a kitchen, so his disciples couldn't stop him from washing their dirty dishes, you grow humbled. The most entertaining part was the short parables that Yogiji Maharaj told. They have a charm to them that is really unique. And, of course, after the parables, there's a whole section containing snippets of conversations with Yogiji Maharaj. I definitely found all of this different material to be charming and engaging. My only complaint is that I wish the book were a bit longer. It's a fairly light read that I finished in about four weeks, during which I read a little bit every night."

4,Reviving Businesses,Corporate Turnarounds provides a valuable roadmap of business strategies for companies faced with sudden discontinuities. As a strategic consultant I have found Mr. Chanda's insights into struggling enterprises illuminating and have recommended the book to a number of my clients.
2,Not happening,"This book appears to be written for people who already completely understand statistics, in which case they probably don't need this book. I'm someone with a undergrad-level understanding of statistics and astronomy and this book does little to further my understanding of either. I wish the authors had taken more care in explaining the subject matter and notation. I didn't expect this to be an introductory statistics book, but IMHO the word ""practical"" should not be in the title. Unless you have an advanced understanding of statistics, this book is not helpful."

5,Volume two - A treasury of guitar music,"The name is right. Many of these pieces are tresures. Volume 2 includes photos (a little too small... each is about 3.5 x 5 inches) of all 94 folios in Codice Saldivar 4(some enhanced because the original has sustained water damage). Also included are transcriptions to the sixty nine pieces in the manuscript. This is a scholarly edition and the transcriptions are for study, not for performance. Do not expect to see fingerings for either right or left hand or other indications for modern guitar."
3,SPHR,"This book is very well rounded and it gets right to the point! I think the content is great. However, I've found at least 10 typos and so far I've only read the exam, the glossary and one chapter! It's distracting when you're trying to to study. There's even a mistake in the answer key. The correct answer to #79 is B. The explaination is written correctly, but the letters are transposed.Dispite the poor editing, I've found it to be a very helpful tool."
1,"Not healthy, useful, or appealing","I bought this book for my Mother who is a Type 2 Diabetic and was very disappointed. The ADA is about 30 years behind on nutrition education. The recipes--besides being overcomplicated and not very appealing--relied on processed foods; white flour, pasta and rice; artifical sweeteners; added sugar; food coloring(?!); and more artifical chemicals and ingredients in the form of lite, low fat junk. No wonder everyone is still fat.My advice is to skip the whole ""diabetes recipes"" ruse and buy a normal healthy cookbook. You'll be much better off."
2,Well-written but pretentious,"This novel, though well-written at times, has a major problem in its choice of characters, all of whom are pretentious expatriates who consider themselves SO superior to stupid Americans (that would be us, the readers). The story itself is ordinary and rather banal, distinguished only, and very occasionally, by the author's adroit use of language. Anyone looking for an actual story or characters outside a very small range of spoiled artistic types, however, should look elsewhere."
4,"A more honest, personal Edmund White","""The Married Man"" is a distinct departure from most of White's previous work. Simplier in style, more intimate in tone and sentiment, ""The Married Man"" is the most accessable of White's work. The reaction of White's readers to such a shift will no doubt be mixed, but I find the change a welcome evolution in an already excellent author. While White's high style and often distant persona served his extensive ""trilogy"" well, the subject matter of ""The Married Man"" demands the simple yet eloquent style embodied in this novel. Poetic, brutally honest and deeply moving -- I can only hope that Mr. White's next work will be as satisfying and complete as this one."
2,Not What I Expected,"I guess I looked for White to provide thought provoking insight into the older/younger gay relationship. I found the book dull and lacking any real direction. The characters were uninteresting and one demensional. The plot dragged on and on and never really went anywhere. I actually found myself skipping paragraphs trying to get to the point of the story. I apologize to anyone who might find this review offensive, but I didn't enjoy this book at all."
3,A Tad Depressing Tragic Tale of Love,"I must grant Edmund White with a wonderful writing style. He got us to know know and like the key characters in this book, Julien & Austin. The storyline lacked stories behind the stories. It seemed a little too blanketed/general. There was something missing. I enjoyed it and did read it to the end, getting some worthwhile lines out of the writer. The character who was dying of AIDS made me feel a bit depressed. I haven't read a lot of books along these lines but I know there are a lot of them on this subject matter. If any reader has already gone there (where a key character dies of AIDS) there's no point in re-visiting...just a warning."
5,I LOVE YANNI!,"I love Yanni! And this CD is my favorite, i have wore it out in my car and listen to it on my Kindle when I work out."
5,Yanni at his very best,"Yanni's music is so beautiful it brought tears to my eyes watching hisLive at the Acropolis DVD. Tears of joy. :o)His music is full of joy and great rhythm. You can tell Yanni loveswhat he is doing. So far this is his best.""I would rather live my life as if there is a God, and die to find outthere isn't, than live my life as if there isn't, and die to find out there is."""
5,Best of the Best,"I loved this concert,Yanni played with so much passion that you can closed your eyes and He take you out of this world and His music is very Beautiful nobody plays like Yanni."
5,this music takes me to a beautiful place within my soul,"Yanni is the best performer that I have had the pleasure to enjoy in a long time. His music really reaches the depth of my heart and soul. I never get tired of hearing his music and hope that he is around for a long, long time."
4,great tool,"This is my 1st but NOT my last Palmgren tool. Fit and finish is very good. Instuction book is clear and easy to follow, tool works GREAT.4 stars only because even at max. depth the staples are just flush not counter sunk, even with 120# of air. The Soft case if Great, allows plenty of storage for extra boxes of staples and no broken plastic hinges. I have 2 othe 18 guage and 1 16 guage finish nailers so this will be dedicated to staples. At this point I would recommend this to everyone."
1,knuckle-scalder,"I made the mistake of replacing my 677 (burned out, but good for many years) with the 678 last June (08). In November 08, the handle unit came unanchored from the kettle because the point of attachment is too fragile for the weight of the full kettle. Kettle is still in use thanks to duct tape around the handle/water unit, but steam escapes from somewhere and scalds the knuckles. This is not a good design, and I would like to return it in exchange for a new 677."
4,I also would like to hear wht the author is up to...,"Like an earlier poster, I would be interested in finding out how the author is faring lately. I disagree that he was misleading, though. He states clearly that he is a short term trader, and discusses the methods he uses. Interestingly, he is similar to the famous fundamental fund manager Peter Lynch, in that he feels its more an art than a science. While Lynch uses his talents for a long term stock picking approach, the author is strictly a short term trader. I found it interesting in that I have never really followed the sentiment approach, or trading at all really, but it gives an interesting insight into the other half of the stock market world."
5,"An Abundance Of ""Happy Old Trees""","Good old Bob Ross! I used to watch his series in high school and his shows were great. This book conveys their tone and has the added bonus of giving us his finished landscapes to look at as long as we want. I got this book so I could see the paintings, but under his step by step instruction I've also tried my hand at creating my own---and making art this nice isn't as easy as Bob makes it look! Whether you want to use this as a how-to guide for your own time in front of a canvas, or you simply like Bob Ross' artwork, this is a friendly visit with everyone's favorite PBS guru of oil painting."
3,Yikes. Perfect for readers who don't like to read...,"Doris Snell's large format picture book, ""Antique Jewelry with Prices"" is perfect for those without the time or inclination to actually READ. Entirely composed of pictures, not always of the highest quality and, absolutely without information other than foot-note sentences identifying the general period of the jewelry featured on the page. Photos are primarily in black and white and could have used some professional lighting to make them crisp. In addition, illustrations apparently taken from old catalogues are included...which would have been very interesting if accompanied by some text. There is a nice Bibliography though. Buy one of those books."
1,Boring!,Everybody knows Draper's secret. Original writers have left or run out of ideas.No new situation to grab your interest. Need more use of Peter and Peggy characters.Roger seems silly. Where's the cool divorcee that was down the street?Haven't seen fat Betsy yet; is that all they've got? Seems a bit misogynistic.
4,"Sex,Alcohol and Cigarettes","I was taken back to an an era of my youth, when stay at home moms were the norm. Women in the working force were given level of jobs in offices where men dominated. I cheered the strongly talented women, who overcame the male dominance and began to soar. This era was spot on with the clothing and chsnges of the time of women in the working place. Lots of sex and alcohol along with incessant cigarette smoking.I understand why men died at earlier ages than atthe present time. Terrific acting of all of the cast members. A four star show indeed.I waited patiently for the release of SeaSON Five after enjoying the first Four AT AMAZON."
5,No such thing as a bad Mad Men Episode,The title of my review says it all. I could just copy and paste this for every episode of Mad Men because it's all good!
5,"Television of the highest caliber, but you already know that, right?","If you're buying season five, chances are you've already seen seasons one through four. And you don't really need to read this review to know how absolutely stunning this show is. Season five was super dark and edgy. Maybe my favorite one yet..."
1,Mad Men,"Sorry about the harsh rating, but the thing is I couldn't watch it at all, it "" will not show in this region"" the sign that came up read. I live in Norway and it is not good policy of Amazon to ship us DVDs that don't work in our foreign recorders! Very disappointing! This was my first, and probably last, purchase of DVDs from Amazon, which on the other hand have exellent service concerning books! Alf Schibstad, Norway."
2,worst season by far...,"Pete's Metro North affair. Harry's Hari-Krishna affair. Don's hallucination episode. Roger's an LCD freak (yea, right). Matt Weiner's son is STILL getting storylines. Joan's a prostitute. Lane kills himself. And it's (another) new day at the agency. Bravo!"
2,down the gurgler,"I'm about half way through the fifth season, and yes, I think that I'm going to abandon it as a piece of worthless drivel. What more can they do with these characters that makes any sense? The present writers are hunting for stories and in so doing they are destroying well formed characters from previous seasons and introducing unbelievable relationships. There is only one word: it's a soap opera. No long term story. My best advice is 'hire some writers'. Sorry it's all over for me. But the first two seasons were good and also the end of season three. After that it's gone down the gurgler."
1,jumping the shark,Mad Men has jumped the shark.All the characters are now wrecked beyond any way to fix them. Joan turns tricks. Pete pimps her out. Roger does nothing. Lane is an embezzler. Peggy is given more responsibility than ever before and then throws a temper tantrum in response before walking out the door. Don yells at everyone and the writers tell us about ten more times what a genius Ginsberg is without anyone asking (or caring). Megan becomes yet more unlikable. And all this agony for a second-rate account like Jag?We get heavy-handed symbolism to tell us that advertising (or business) and prostitution are really the same thing. How profound. How shallow and how poorly written.They have written themselves into a corner. There isn't anywhere for any of the characters to go now.
5,Best TV show ever,"mad men season 5 finale ending sequence starting from the new office window gazing, through the walking off set (epic cinematography), to the ""are you alone"" ending... just wow. that is an epic piece of film making and should have won the emmy just for that. just wow. and the opening and closing of doors motif. just wow. weiner is a genius.The rest of the season is full of gems like this. this is easily the best peace of TV I have ever seen. And that is inclusive of the Sopranos..."
5,"Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce... Oh, wait...","Though it may not have been the best season, it more than satisfied on TV. Plus it's a solid DVD release sold at an agreeable price."
3,"better than first two episodes, still feels pointless","This season has been very disappointing so far, this episode starts to pick up the pace, but frankly its still very shallow. The day to day with these characters now feels only slightly more exciting than my own life, and my life is not very exciting. The new char that is introduced in this episode does seem to hold some promise, so I am a little more exciting about this season, but I'm not expecting much given the horrible start."
3,WHY,"Why do we need to care that Betty is fat, when we all know January Jones was pregnant? Why is she still on the show? Cheap. And boring."
2,I'm Done with Mad Men,In 5 it lacks everything that made it magical in the beginning. The characters are ho-humand the story does not draw me to the next show. It is boring!
1,wont work,"I bought seasons 1 - 4 but the disk wont play in my dvd palyer, I know its not the player as every thing else works in it. the dvds do however work in the computer, I am going crazy. this is very frustrating."
4,Love this Instant Video access,"I had to miss the Mad men series this spring because of a dispute between AMC and Dishnetwork. Luckily, Amazon has made it possible for me to catch up online. I'm a happy camper now with Instant Video! Thanks Amazon!"
2,Prosaic readings,"The Chicago Symphony was one of the best orchestras under Solti. This prosaic reading of Saint-Saens Third Symphony is a testimony to Barenboim art. It does feel we're dealing with some university orchestra following an obscure academic conductor whose inspiration never reached further than ensuring the score is played and parents can hear their offspring play their line, but I could not have imagined that I was listening to an orchestra such as the CSO.If there is only one copy left as advertised, leave it!"
5,Worked like a charm,"My son fractured his upper arm just below his shoulder and had to wear a cast from his shoulder to his mid forearm. Considering the awkward cast, the cover worked great. He was able to go to the pool and beach with no problems. The only bad thing about it is that it constricts the arm and does cut off circulation if not put on correctly. The directions do tell you to not to keep it on for more than 45 minutes, so if you follow the directions you will be fine. I definately would recommend this product!"
3,Nifty - But . . .,"Nifty - But considerably over priced, & therefore an extremely poor value.There should have been more, much more. Also, see warranty!"
4,nice as expected,Nice packBattery recharger should be includedkit to connect old rcx parts should be included
4,Building bodies and brains,"I bought this item for use in my machine learning lab. I've had my graduate students build with the older MindStorms and these new ones and they've done some excellent work. This time, I tried to do some building myself. It took some practice getting familiar with the Technic pieces and I still don't feel real comfortable with them. The connectors for the motors seem inadequate. But, overall, it seems like a reasonable design and we were able to achieve our goals. Could use another light sensor, though."
5,"Great Educational ""Toy""",This is a really good educational toy for the parents that want a child to learn technology.When combined with other Lego pieces the creations are endless.
4,very good,A new girl is in Sweet Valley and Jessica knows that she is the same girl who once starred in movies..as a really small child.The stars' name is Maria Slater.Maria is nervous of anyone knowing her true identity as she so much wants to be befriended for who she really is.
3,Weary of Ms. Paris,"This book, as you may guess, is for fans only. As books go, it's well written enough; however if you're like me you've already seen/heard enough about the subject matter to last a thousand lifetimes. I don't ""hate"" Hilton because she's young, rich and beautiful; I despise her because the woman is EVERYWHERE. ""Change the channel"" they say. ""Turn the page if you don't want to read about her."" Sure. But after six months of turning the page, changing the channel, not buying the magazine, going to a different website, etc., you get REALLY weary of the effort it takes to avoid her. What in the world is the fascination, anyhow? Anyway, if for whatever reason you still haven't gotten enough of this woman, this book is for you."
1,Don't defend the spoiled,"Paris Hilton is a waste of human space. I am sorry but she is. People say, oh look...she can feed cows and do normal things.....HELLO! She does it b/c she is getting paid a ton of money and oh it's furthering her ""career"". I think you will find that people do not take her seriously because she is not a serious person. I am not down on all celebs, but I support the celebs that are actually involved in helping people and in the community rather than celebs (wait, can you even call her that???) who are just interested in themselves. I just think there are so many more people out there who are prettier both inside and out. There are people out there who have come to accomplish great things and they didn't do it with Daddy's credit card or their last name."
3,Anyone for Albania?,"I always purchase a guidebook when I move to a new country and finding one on Albania was not easy so I first of all appreciated that Bradt had published a guide book to this not-so-traveled-to-country. The book is good for basic site information but not as comprehensive as some other brands. You won't find another one though so in this case, I am most pleased."
2,WARNING!! THIS 2000 MANIACS IS AN INFERIOR PRINT,"COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS DVD EDITION RELEASED BY THE SAME COMPANY IN 2000.BOTH BLOOD FEAST AND COLOR MEBLOOD RED APPEAR FINE,AS DO THE EXTRAS.BUT THIS 2000 MANIACS IS SPLICEY AND SCRATCHED UP IN AT LEAST 2 SCENESBUY THE DVD 2000 MANIACS HERE ON AMAZON,ITS WAY CHEAP AND ITS IN GREAT SHAPE,LIKE THE OTHER TWO FILMS ONDVD. SHAME ON SOMETHING WEIRD,IMAGE ET AL11!!"
4,Satisfied customer,"Satisfied customerThe thermostat, I would highly recommend it to anyone. It works far better than I was expecting. Order/receiving products was satisfactory."
2,Crap. I'm very disappointed by this album.,"At least I got it as a gift from a friend. The only salvageable tracks are ""Baby"", and ""Down on the corner"". The rest is another cover: ""In Between Days"" by the Cure, and filler material. This is their third album since their breakup and reunion, their first two being ""Me mata la vida"" and ""10,000Km"",;disappointing albums. Their best efforts are the first five CDs: Rosas Rojas (''89), Escenas de la vida amorosa ('91), Devorador de corazones ('93), Huija ('95) and their first live album, hopelessly out of print and rare: La Portuaria En vivo ('96). Their return in 2001 with ""Me Mata La vida"" was an exercise in hype, egos and futility. The well ran dry. Though they did sell CDs and a couple of hit singles came emerged, the material on their albums since then has been forgettable. Try to find the first 5 CDs I pointed out, or go for a greatest hits compilation. Either way you'll enjoy this band at their prime. Right now, they are all coasting downhill."
1,Water dispenser Leaks,"I recently purchased two of these water dispensers. Yes, they are extremeley cute. But the first one I recieved leaks from the spout where the water comes out of. I havent opened the second one but I plan on returning it."
1,uugh,"There was no problem with the shipping or the order process in general as far as the seller, however, the product is crudy. Valve constantly leaks water and that defeats the purpose of having a water dispenser because you can't leave the bottle on top unless you like to have a lake view on your desk/counter."
1,Don't buy it!,"Bob's record company put out this album to try and scrap a few more bucks out of his fans, Bob himself urged people not to buy it, it was compiled and released without his consent. You're doing Bob a disservice if you pony up any dough for this one."
2,frustrating,"This TV mount works well enough,if you can figure it out.The directions are almost useless.I called the factory for directions and the woman I talked to was rude and no help.After enlisting my wife and friends help, we discovered how to mount and operate this mount."
1,Circumcision stance teaches social conformity,"Great Expectations happens to teach how to conform to societal standards and subject our babies to amputations so that their girlfriends can continue the same sexists attitudes and to perpetuate locker room bullying of intact and natural bodies. Perhaps it should also teach us to give our daughters breast enlargement surgeries before they are too old to remember it so that we can conform to the assumption that men like larger breasts, or we should perform labiaplasties on our baby daughters so they look like porn stars or barbies for their future boyfriends. Way to go Jones and Jones.This is in reference to this snippet: """"In America, many women are used to, and prefer, the circumcised look, and we can only assume that they assume their son's future girlfriends will too. Some dads worry that their sons will be teased if their looks don't conform to the majority of boys in the locker room."""""
2,Badly organized and missing a lot of info,"My husband just bought this book for me. I'm newly pregnant (3 months). But I'm finding it so hard to read this book. I have to flip pages all the time because of the way it is organized. First I have to go to the section that is organized by weeks to read about my body changes. But then, if I want to read about morning sickness, I have to find it somewhere else in the book. Then, if I want to read about gaining weight, I have to find in another section. Also, since I have never been pregnant before, I don't know what to expect -- so until I have a symptom, I don't know what to read about. It's not preparing me for my pregnancy at all. Too disorganized. I think I'll buy the Pregnancy Week by Week book or What to expect when your expecting instead."
5,SOLID,"For the price this is a good buy. It dosen't need lubrication. You can hang it on your belt. It comes with an extra tip and extra 1/8"" leeway for the brads. You get a pack of 2"" brads and also a fabric case."
5,As good as I remember,"My absolute favorite cold weather undies, hands down. Warm, comfortable and long lasting - my first pair is still good after 5 years of heavy wear. I just got around treating myself to more pairs. Well worth the cost."
4,Toot Sweet,"Toots is down in 'smile a mile wide' cruise zone here, with the soul-stirring sounds of Brazil's finest muso's-vocalists coming along for a ride you are bound to regret ending. Stellar line-ups 'to die for' sometimes misfire, but not on this album. It's sweet as Amazonian honey. Granted, no radical boundary pushing found here, but don't hold the civilised, comfortable tone against it. The sound is impeccably balanced, light and sensual. So harmonically tasteful it's bound to make you turn the lights down low and.... ooh la la. Life is better than good with Toots and the Gang in fine, serenade form."
3,"Tastes great, but too much salt!","If I didn't have high blood pressure, I'd eat these every week. They are great tasting, filling, and vegan. If it weren't for the large amounts of salt (quite ridiculous!), I would say that these are quite ""fantastic"" in content. Eat these only if you don't have hypertension or are on a low sodium diet."
4,Outrageously underrated,"This is a great album. ""100 Years Ago"" could be the best thing Mick and Keith have ever written, and ""Winter"" isn't too far behind. Most of these songs (save the silly ""Dancing with Mr. D"", which has the odd honor of being the Stones' first exercise in self-parody) are brilliant, affecting tunes that recall ""Exile on Main Street"" in flavor and character -- and I can't think of any higher praise than that."
1,Censored!,I can't believe they released a censored version of this underrated classic stones album - pathetic. Why not just slap a parental advisory sticker on it. The stones should be ashamed of themselves!
1,What a let down,"This is the first failure of the Stones' career, and it really hurt at the time of release. The music scene was drying up in 1973 anyway, and then this lackluster, dull, tired effort came out and it was so disappointing. It is not so much that the songs are slight, although some are, but so many are performed in a tired out way, with sophisticated polish but without the passion that had been at the heart of the Stones work up to this point. This is the first boring Stones album. Those of us who loved them from the beginning knew that it would never be the same again, and in fact it wasn't."
3,Goat's P**s Soup,"The Stones notorious excess takes it's toll on GHS,and the songs as well as the musicianship suffer as well.The album sounds a bit lazy and winded as well as some songs being sub-par.Only Angie and the underrated Doo Doo Doo(Heartbreaker)stand out as well as Kieth Richard's lament Coming Down Again.Star Star is all hustle and half muscle.Coming after Exile on Main St,it seemed worse than many made it to be,but GHS, though coming out a haze of excess would set the tone for future releases to come."
5,Sleeper Album,"""Winter"" is simply the most gorgeous rock and roll ballad on record. Anywhere. At any time. It's lush and earthy at the same time. For me, and I love me some ballads, this trumps ""Tangerine"", ""Wild is the Wind"" and ""Danceaway"" (by Led Zep, Bowie, and Roxy Music, respectively).Goats is a timeless, seamless album. Brilliant."
4,Costume,The picture is kind of misleading. It shows what appears to be a man dressed in a Ninja Warrior Costume but when I received this product it is a woman. My son wasn't too impressed with that but I smoothed it over by saying it was a unisex costume. Other than that the costume is fine.
2,Item received different than what is shown on web,"I wanted a register with a surface-flush sliding mechanism. That is what the picture shows. The register I received has a metal lever that can stick straight out from the surface of the register. It can be a bit of a hazard in a kid's room. So, product probably OK, but company sent incorrect item. It looks like they sent a Truaire C102M, but the Amazon picture shows something else."
1,waste o' money,Just bought this for my Comcast service that I started up in September. It is constantly dropping the connection and going offline. I've been through all the troubleshooting with Comcast and now they want me to replace my modem. Ha! If only they knew I just bought it! Not to mention it sounds like there is something loose inside of it. This couldn't possibly be my fault considering it has been peacefully sitting on my desk from the minute I opened the package. What a waste of money! >: (Now with the cost of this modem + $ Comcast to come out and attempt to resolve the problem+ the cost of my new modem= Enough money for a significantly nicer modem that probably even works!
2,Doesn't open the Internet,It will not allow me to open the internet. Pleas tell me how do I get another one that's functional?ThanksAnna
2,WAS Nice,Was a nice modem and worked very well...... then my service improved and now it doesn't work. time to upgrade i guess.....
5,Works like a charm.,"No more rentals, works with your cable internet connection...get it activated in about 15-30 mins and you're good to go, no software to install just plug activate and go. You need to drop that rental? This will suit your needs nicely at a reasonable price."
5,"Best experience, ever","I purchased a used Motorola SurfBoard which I wanted to use with our provider Comcast. When the modem arrived at our house, we contacted Comcast and they wanted to know the MAC address which was supposed to be printed on it. The modem we purchased didn't have the printed number just a bar code. We e-mailed Fuzebox and explained the problem. We immediately received a e-mail back and had several suggestions on what to do, along with Motorola websites that had instructions on how to find the address. Following their instructions, it took about 20 minutes and the problem was solved!Thank you FuzeBox, your service is the best."
4,Packaging and Print Material,I expected the item to arrive with the installion guide and other print material to be included. Otherwise I am pleased with the item.
5,Rocks dude....,"it's worth the upgrade from the 4200 ""this new model has a very nice looking design"" installed without any problems A++++++++++++++++++"
5,Happy Motorola Surfboard SB5100 Cable Modem User,"I bought this product from Amazon in April 2004. I bought this modem after renting a cable modem (COM21) from Comcast for over 3 years. With my old cable modem, I was losing my Internet connection frequently. I went to my favorite broadband sites and posted that I was looking for a new cable modem. This modem was mentioned more often than other brands. Since I bought it, I've had very little problems. I've only lost one connectiob with it once. That was during a winter storm in early January 2005. I use a 4-port Linksys router along with a 16-port Linksys switch workgroup."
2,Not what I needed,I needed cable and phone modem and it did not have phone hook ups so I returned it. I thought I was over charged once it was returned.
4,works well,Have been using this cable modem for about 4 months. Prevously owned another Motorola Surfboard which which I gave to my parents. They are still using it without problems. Would recommend this product
4,"Good product, as advertised","The modem arrived on time, intact and works great - everything just the way it was advertised! I bought it because my cable company upped my modem rental charge by 75%, and this will pay itself off in 4 months. I don't use or need any lightning-fast devices for uploads or mammoth projects, so I don't know how this compares in that realm, but for typical home internet use of paying bills and reading news, it's great."
2,a waist of my time,the early works dont really do much for my art. if you want my oppinion jump to 1995 or later
1,Terrible product and terrible company,We were excited when we heard about the Xero Sox for my son was having surgery on his hand in the summer and this would allow him to swim with a cast on. It didn't work out at all. The XeroSox was so small and tight that we couldn't even fit it over his cast (which went from the middle of his lower arm to his hand and covered the pinky and ring finger).When I asked the company if I could return it they were VERY RUDE in stating that it wasn't possible.Do yourself a favor and don't buy one. It's just a waste of money.
4,It survived summer camp!,"My daughter broker wrist three days before a week at summer camp. With quick shipping we got the cover the day before we drove her up. This size xerosox just covered the cast up to her elbow, which while secure, it didn't quite work for full submersion under the water. Still my 9 year old was able to use the xerosox by herself and was able to swim, shower and every other thing they did at camp. I recommend this product and will use it again, but we would have gone with a bigger size."
3,ok,"this looked like a great product, the most expensive. It was very difficult to put on, perhaps the measurements were to be with the cast on. It got 2 holes in it after the 3rd or 4th use. But the first few times worked great. My daughter did complain her fingers got numb, so it gets very tight. I would recommend it for short term use!"
3,Meh.,There are only 2 or 3 tracks on this CD worth a listen so I can't really recommend getting this CD.
5,I wish there was more where this came from!,"If you like the old lords of acid and praga khan, you'll love this album! It's a must have for anyones LOA & Friends music collection."
1,This book is so outdated,This book is so outdated. Stay away from it. Book is 13 years old. Not in touch with today's internet environment. I bought it for a Domain Names class I am taking. I paid 1 dollar for it (the book actually had a yard sale tag on it that said 50 cents. I guess it would not even sell for that). It might have had a place at one time. It now needs to be retired. Don't waste your money or your time on this book.
1,Getting know where,"It sucked. It tells you the same stuff you already know, submit to search engines bla bla, super basic, no secrets or anything like that, you'll find your self skipping pages tell you get to the end of the book. He knows allot about the web, but not much about getting hits."
2,Do yourself a favor and pass this one by...,"I was desperate when I bought this pink elephant. Our corporate web site had been up nearly a year, we weren't getting hits and the bosses were planning on pulling the plug on the whole operation, meaning my job. I bought this book and another called Producing Hits out of desperation but neither book did a thing for the web site and our hits even though I followed everything discussed to the last detail.Thank God I decided to give this one more chance with an brand new book out of left field called Increase Your Web Traffic in a Weekend. I had never even heard of this book but with my job on the line, I decided to give it a chance. I followed everything the author discussed and waited with my fingers crossed. Thanks to Increase Your Web Traffic our web site traffic soared from 100 hits a day to 1,500 hits a day and I am continuing to see traffic increase!"
4,Works well - no problems,Reading some of the reviews for other replacement batteries that didn't work well makes you appreciate something that just does what it's supposed to.
4,Panasonic Cordless Telephone Battery (HHR-P104),"I've had this battery for a few weeks now, and so far it appears to be holding well! Its better to replace the battery rather than the whole phone."
5,phone battery,It was so much cheaper to buy on-line and it worked great. So many batteries look the same so just make sure you pick the correct one.
4,Ordered 4 batteries; they came in 3 separate shipments,"At the time I ordered, it said to hurry because there was only 4 left. I ordered 4 in one order. I received 1 battery in a box that could have easily fit 10. The other 3 came the next day in 2 separate boxes on 2 separate delivery trucks. Maybe they came from different warehouses. Phones work better now."
3,Good Product; Digital Media Source overcharged on Shipping,"I ordered three phone batteries all at one time and they work fine. Digital Media Source charged me three separate shipping fees (almost $18), but they sent the three batteries in one package. I figure they overcharged me 60 percent on shipping."
5,Panasonic Cordless Telephone Battery (HHR-P104A/1B-29,"Correct size for Phone, Phone now works as new. Would buy again, ships quickly. I have nothing more to say but this review wants 6 more words before submitting?"
5,panasonic battery,well what to say...battery ordered was that delivered and it worked as advertised. Perfect experience.
2,I didnt stay long,I didn't stay for more than 6 months!! I was expecting minimum 1 yr but didn't last that long! Though it was not pricey!
5,Leaves you with restoration and resilience,"This book provides real-life approaches for helping and healing. It is a must-read for counselors, teachers and parents because readers can draw inspiration and information. Counseling roles and training models are presented. Helping techniques for families and professionals are included. Finally, we receive a book that is not problem oriented but possibility and power oriented. The solutions range from commonsense to clinical to revolutionary. A collaboration between counselors, teachers and parents, this book is creating a new network of healers."
4,"not her best, but good","It took me a couple of times listening to this album to really be able to enjoy it. The sound is different from both Deep Natural and Short Sharp Shocked. This isn't to say that the sound is bad, but it was different enough to require several spins on my cd player. The more I listen to this album, though, the more I like it. I'm not quite sure how to describe the music, even compared to her other work, but Michelle Shocked is one of the best musicians I've heard. The only track that I can't really listen to is the first one, ""Stillborn"". The wailing is too much for me. I haven't gotten into the story behind the song, but this may be a song that'll grow on me in a few years (much like ""Professional Widow"" by Tori Amos did). The rest of the album is quite solid and includes the gem ""A Child Like Grace""."
1,dire,"I really liked her 1st three albums, mainly for their funny streak. By contrast, this album is a god-botherers dirge. As it says on the 1st inside page ""All Glory to God!"". Had it been on the cover, I might have had the good sense to save some money."
3,It was ok,"I love Harney & Sons, their Hot Cinammon spice and Chamomile is my favorite.This one was nice and bold, but not for me. I had to add alot of sugar and it tasted a little burnt/bitter/off for me.Smells good though."
4,"Slipping, but still gripping!","The mysterious intrigue continues in season 2.Four teenaged friends with diverse interests and talents must work together to solve the identity of the mysterious A, who stalks their lives and sends threatening messages.The plot thickens in this season as more potential suspects come out of the woodwork. The girls try to navigate everyday pressures such as boyfriends, parents, and homework . . . while trying not to fall into A's deadly traps.Some of the plot points start to get a bit tired in this season and some things are a bit too over the top, but overall it still captures your interest.A is finally unmasked at the end of the season, but season three (which has just started playing on television) promises new mysteries!"
1,bootlegg,Horrible dont buy i was half way threw the frist eipisode n it froze n i looked at the disc n it was soo scratched n so was everyother video i went to the store to buy new ones n realized my amazon was a complete bootleg everything was different from the case discs n even graphic there lucky i dont report them
2,not too happy,"After ordering and receiving this sprial bound manuscript book, I realized that it was not what I thought it was and I could not use it at all. It was poorly described It cost me $12.14 to purchase and then another $5.50 to return it. Now the seller is only refunding me $6+ for the item because he is deducting his shipping costs! Should have just thrown it out and not bothered to return it. Will be much more careful and selective with my orders in the future. You don't always get satisfaction!"
3,"Olive, not Green","This blanket is olive, as described in other listings, not green. The pattern isn't as clear as I'd hoped for being printed on the fuzzy, felt-like topside. Otherwise, it seems to be well-made. Keep in mind that this is a large blanket, and not something for backpacking."
1,Easy Spirit Women's Muestra Slip-on,"It is not comfortable to wear. It is so hard. All the while when you look at it online, it seems it's so soft but it's not in the reality."
4,Prices too low. Good photo ID.,"This is the first and only book on string holders. I find the photos good for identification purposes, however, there are some she has pictured that I know are NOT genuine string holders.Prices are way below prices in the real world.It is a good first book, but Sharon, or someone else, needs to go further into the world of string holders.Even with its few faults, I would never give up my copy!!"
3,Kind of more of the same,"Mato Nanji is undisputedly a very talented guitar player. However, he's unwilling or unable to step out of the shadow of Stevie Ray. I'm not saying he isn't good at what he does. He doesn't sound a little like Stevie, there are times I would assume that Double Trouble can hardly tell the difference. Mato has stated that he wanted to work on strengthening his vocals this time out. I think he's done that and downplayed the guitar pyrotechnics somewhat. All in all, a fine effort and worth your time even he can't help sounding like the big man."
3,Simple Review,Good movie with a twist. The twist leaves it up to the viewer of who seduce who in this movie.
3,Good Book,"It is for Christmas present but as I can recall, it is okay, not what I thought it should be. I got it a few years ago. So I am not the one who share the comment. Again, it is not a real recipe book, more of story or something like that."
5,Handy Geology answer book,This was a present to someone. I just gave them the book and they loved it. Everything you wanted to know about Geology but were afraid to ask.It arrived in a timely manner. Could not have gotten anything better.
2,Barbie Talks?,"We bought this clock so our 5 year old daughter could learn how to tell time. She was extremely excited about hearing Barbie's voice, as stated in the product description. There is no indication anywhere on the package or on the clock that there are special messages to hear from Barbie. My daughter decided she wanted keep the clock anyway, but was very disappointed."
1,Prospective Purchaser Alert,"Prospective purchasers of this product would do well to read the customer reviews of Quickbooks Pro 2004 before making their purchase, as many of the same issues should apply."
5,New Voice in Southern Fiction,Mindy Friddle has written an unforgettable novel filled with sharply drawn characters and well-crafted prose. This is a must-read for fans of Southern fiction. A stunning debut!
4,Refreshingly clear study guide,"I was very impressed with the layout, the actual reading material was very clear and informative, I was a novice, and this was ideal for me. very american."
1,There are too many errors to trust any of the information.,"I want my money back. Don't waste yours. The information can range from simple things like references to transfer rates as ""MegaBytes"" instead of ""MegaBits"" to test questions which ask about Netware to NT connectivity and the answer has ""AppleTalk"" as the answer. If Jason is this sloppy, I'd hate to have my network designed by him. This product should embarrass him. The title sould be ""MCSE Completely Full Of Mistakes""."
2,cheap looking leather but working,"cheap quality, but it works. at least it does it job.this holder doens't look fancy at all. it looks like fake leather to me... or feel like it.the reason i gave it 2 stars is because it does the jobs... it does hold your passport, couple ID cards and some notes papers."
4,Less is more,"I first found this product through a referral from someone using it,at first I wasnt happy with either the smell or sticky feel it gave my skin. But, I kept trying it and soon learned that if you apply too much it wont absorb as well. So put it on sparingly after cleaning your face at night and before your moisturizer in the morning. I love the feel of my skin and I have two daughters now using it that had some skin issues that were cleared up using this serum."
1,Don't buy it!,"I bought this toy as a Christmas gift for my nephews. The thing never worked. The video has a terrible flicker. After 2 hours, back to the box and never came out again."
1,A not-a-recommended book,"The looks and feel make a person feel he's got much more than he intended to get. But the first few chapters itself reveal the lack of proper synchronization between the book and the accompanying CD. Not even 10% of the pics match with the actual screens.Overall, this book is recommended if a person wants to learn websphere for the heck of learning."
2,The included CD is worthless,"The CDROM included with this book is worthless. The chapter ""Installing and Starting Websphere"" describes installing Version 2.0 of Websphere Application Server, but the CD contains Version 3. As a result, not a single paragraph or screen shot is even remotely accurate. Furthermore, The book says that DB will be installed automatically as part of the installation. DB2 is not on the CD at all. And either DB2 or Oracle MUST be installed in order for Websphere to even start up."
3,Book Condition,"I think I was expecting it to be in slightly better condition, according to its description/rating. I was already familiar with this boo though, so everything was fine - content-wise."
2,Shallow!,"This book is all glossy pictures, and very little text. No history, and no in-depth instructions, apart from what to use and how much."
5,Very Nice,"I love it! Just got it yesterday, too. IT's a bit exensive, I guess, but it looks REAL nice and operates pretty well, too. The headphone is also cool since you wear it on the back of your head, not the top."
1,What a Lemon!,"I got this CD player for Christmas, and I was so excited. It played pefectly, until I wanted to listen to CD that I burned myself. The first CD I listened to skipped. I was surprised, because the brand of CD that I used just happened to be Sony also.The CD had NO SCRATCHES or DUST. I made more CDs with different brand name CDs, and different burning software applications. All of them skipped. I returned the CD player to Target with no problem, and got a new one. The new CD player did the same thing.I'm not sure if it was just a random problem, but I would avoid this CD player if you listen to music that you make yourself."
2,Volume problems,"I just got this player and it's been nothing but frustration. The buttons are extremely small and closely spaced. The biggest flaw is the volume control. It's so sensitive, that if anything bumps the area of the volume control, it lowers the volume... even if you're just touching the casing near the VOL-. Also, it sticks on mute. The manual touches on this in the trouble shooting area, saying that if ""The volume does not increase even if you press VOL+ repeatedly"" you should ""Press and hold SOUND until 'AVLS' disappears from the display"". The problem is that the ""AVLS"" function doesn't have to be engaged for this volume issue to happen. The buttons are so sensitive & closely spaced that the VOL+ button sometimes works as the VOL- instead. In addition, this mute/volume issue can lock up all of the buttons since it's a completely digital product.Unless you're planning to use the ""hold"" function continuously to keep the volume at a constant level, I'd avoid this product."
4,"Finally, a scribing system that works!","I have tried various methods of scribing trim in the past with limited success and avoided it whenever I could. After a recent less than successful attempt to fit trim to a wall I decided to give the Accuscribe a try. It is easy to use, works well, and gives consistent results. One of those inexpensive tools that make life easier. The wide flat bottom gives you an easy way to control your scribe and the little turn screws lock the settings in place. I'm only a home DIYer but my skill level has gone up with the addition of this simple tool."
2,Unreliable,"Poor execution of a good idea. The nut used to tighten this in the desired position simply doesn't work. It's very easy for the setting to change as you're using it. So what good is it if it won't stay where you set it? Not much, I say."
3,Ok Design,"Could be improved, a bit clumsy to use. Very rigid when tightened. Pencil sharpener is really not needed and makes design wider than it has to be."
3,It's OK,"Sloppy workmanship. I had to use a pocket knife to cut away the flashing from the molded plastic parts before it would properly fit the edge of the piece I was scribing. Design of the brass thumbnut/screw assemblies needs improvement. In order to get the pivots tight enough, I have to use a screwdriver to keep the screw from rotating as I tighten the thumbnut. If you leave the pivot tight, it is hard to adjust accurately. If you leave it loose, the setting can to easily change inadvertently. I might try using an internal lock washer under the head of the screw to hold it in place as I tighten the thumbnut. A captive nut used with a thumbscrew would have worked better. This is another example of cutting too many corners in manufacturing. I don't know of a better alternative so I will have to put up with it. It's made in China, so maybe that is part of the problem - like so many other products from China."
4,Well made,"I've always used the 99 cent compasses for scribing and other layout work. But I have been upgraded. This tool is well worth the $13. The additional pivot arm allows to scribe 1/16"" off material. The large flat back allows you to slide very evenly, and accurate. The brass lock nuts are much better for holding your setup.Overall, very pleased"
3,A Little Scary,"The adults in my house thought this was falling-down funny, but my toddler refuses to go into the bathroom now. How do you explain this gag to a screaming 3-year-old! Just hope I haven't scarred the little guy for life."
5,Blue Dogs- one of the best things about living in Charleston,"This is a great group of guys who really know how to jam, be it at the rustic beach front club the Windjammer ,where our parents grew up too, or in the crowded streets of a small college town like Athens (that I personally helped convert). The Blue Dogs is the best off shore fishing cd that you will find- the fish enjoy it too and the next thing you know, a 350 lb blue has jumped in the boat to hear Futch strumming away, a little better. Just wish my friends would quit 'borrowing' my cd!"
4,A ton to do for the money spent!,"I bought this craft kit elsewhere for more, and I still thought it was worth every penny. From the tatoos, to the coloring pages, to the stickers the kids can color themselves...it was a blast. And as fun as the markers are to smell, they aren't so fun to get off your table (our's will be green forever, I fear). All in all, a great purchase for any crafty kid. (and that tatoos have enough of pupcake and clouds and such, that my younger son could enjoy the fun too)"
4,A Romance Junkie,"This was a really good story, and I enjoyed it very much and I wish I had read the Sheiks stolen bride first. Paolo was just gorgeous and to save his school mate from an arranged marriage, he married her himself. Helene was in love with Paolo but never told him so twelve years pass and the sheik finally marries so the threat is over. Now Paolo shows up at her doorstep with divorce papers. They go through this emotional roller coaster ride and the ending is very good. I recommend it highly."
2,Fantastic? I don't think so!,I was happy to see organic split pea soup but my happiness turned into a huge disappointment. It has to be the one of the worst I have ever tasted. I do not recommend.
5,This book is a blessing!,This is a great book. My walk with the Lod is much closer after reading it!
1,Beware the Haze,"Nowhere in the product description does it mention the hazing after a few minutes of spraying, unlike the regular detailer spray from Turtle Wax and Meguiar that I used before. Not only is the spray hard to spread when wet, but after it's hazed and hardened it's a biotch to remove, needing a great deal of elbow stamina.Not recommended. I'll go back to Mequiar."
5,Heal Thyself - Write,"To show how powerful this book is, I write a Barbara Garro Poem as my review--Your Choices Create Your LifeSheer will allows life undamagedSheer will refuses to allow compromise of your happinessSheer will creates freedom of choiceAnd choice allows lifeNo one can hold your conversationNo one can take your freedomNo one will create your lifeLouise DeSalvo created a book in ""Writing as a Way of Healing"" to get you to this place of freedom and choice."
2,Very strange,"A very strange movie indeed. I am still not sure what it was about. It seems to be about a movie vampire with a foot fedish, but I can't be sure. The movie was OK but somehow I liked the first film better. If this is a sequel they missed the point of a sequel."
1,A Piece of Crap,"I am the author this book and would like to state here how offended I was by the homophobic remarks of the reader whose comments follow. I am an openly gay man and a passionate supporter of gay rights. No one who reads my book could imagine otherwise. Perhaps if this reader had had the courage to use his e-mail address, I would be able to answer his comments directly, but as is so often the case with bigots, he has chosen to remain anonymous.Thanks. Daniel Harris"
3,upset,"alright so i just got my fruits basket and im not very happy right now i pain $33 for it and theres a stain on it but it was covered by the wraping with the little pic pathlet thing and its big and ugly and im upset and dont know what to do there not going to take it back i unwraped it but the only way to see the stain was by unwraping it. i have bought from amazon 5 diffent times and i injoyed it alot but i dont know this is making me have doughts about it, and dont know what to do. Fruits basket was the first anime that i ever watched and i always wantted it but theres a big stain right above Tohru's head and i dont like it any ideas?"
1,Practically perfect in every way,"An anime for girls with a stereo typical sweet innocent 2 dimensional heroine, who begins the series 100% perfect and ends the series with zero growth or evolution as a character."
4,Superman-The complete collection.,"First off im going to say that this series in general is one of my favorite series. along with batman/batman beyond and Justice league. It's also nicely intertwinned with batman volume 4 from the batman series. Also speaks of events in the justice league series later involving Superman/Darkside. As an overall series it was well done and enjoyable for kids and DC fans in general. Only issue is the double sided Cds which are horribly packaged...The last cd is guarenteed scratched due to the way it was packaged, if you plan on purchasing this series get a seperate case for cd 6(I believe/last double sided disc). that should solve alot of issues if you want to keep your cds in good condition...other then that great product. 4/5."
4,Classical Book for Speech recognition,"This ia a classical book on speech recognition. It covers the basic concepts and practical speech recognition Techniques. The first tutorial on HMM by Rabiner,appeared in IEEE, is included in this book with much more practical examples. This book helped me a lot during my post graduation and work in the area of speech recognition. Thanks to Rabiner and Juang !!!"
5,Autometic Connectedword Large vocubalury SpeechRecognition,Ifound this book is very helpfull for Speech Recognition and any other Speech Processing
3,Graphics quality is poor,"Bought this notebook because of its low price, was very impressed initially with its speed, good looks and thin dimensions.But once I started working on it, the lack of a graphics card and possibly poor screen quality made for strenuous viewing. I was forced to return the machine I bought for this reason. Averatec must consider putting in a graphics card into this machine.. that will make it a good bet."
3,Up and down with the Rolling Stones,"When Undercover first appeared, I remember the reviews could be neatly divided into those that claimed it to be the best in years, with smokin' guitars and a sense of mischief; and those which damned it as half-formed dreck. In truth, it's a bit of both. When it's good it's very very good, and those moments tend to be when the band is attempting new ground (Undercover Of The Night, Feel On Baby, Too Much Blood). When it's bad it's Stones-by-numbers riffola, and that's most of the record, although both She Was Hot and All The Way Down's tales of Wimmen Done Me Wrong raise a laugh. (So does multi-millionaire Keith Richards' avowal on Wanna Hold You that 'I hope you find it funny that I got no money ...' We do, Keith, we do.) Some laziness in the studio had yet to be excised. One for the collectors only."
3,Lots of errors in the 1999 edition,"This edition of Sauerland's Grant's Dissector is much better illustrated than previous editions and has very useful cross-referencing to various atlases. However, it seems it was not edited very carefully since it has many many errors in it. We are trying to put together a list of all these errors to submit to the publisher, as I am sure are other gross anatomy professors across the US, but buyers of the edition in its present form should be aware of this serious problem."
1,Just use the filthy lab copy if you get stuck,"Study an atlas before you go into lab. You can figure out how to dissect almost everything without a dissector. If you get stuck, ask a professor, but reference this book only as a last resort. There are MUCH better ways of accessing certain structures than the instructions in this book. There is absolutely no reason to have your own personal copy. The one plus about this edition is that references to other atlases besides Grant's (terrible) are given."
1,Why was this film made?,"After watching this film with total disgust, I wondered why this film was made? On this disk is a short film from which the idea for this film came. They should have left it as only a short film, which is watchable. The longer film is nothing but a grossly dis-functional family with 2 boys that should be in prison or mental wards. They beat and kick a man laying on the floor, they verbally assault a lone woman, they steal, berate their parents and so on. Don't waste your money on this one. There is no nudity, no sex, just two sadistic rotten to the core boys."
1,Has to be something better available,"This book is seriously out of date and is geared strictly to the person willing to rent a car to visit the sites described. All information is based on this premise with little information given about other means of transportation, tours, etc. I agree with a previous reviewer that the photos were pretty grim and the author's description of Gyumri (where I spent two weeks as a volunteer) left me wondering why I had decided to go there. Contrary to this, I found the people to be some of the most generous, pleasant and hospitable people I have the privilege of meeting. So much for Mr Holding's description of how he found the country and the people."
1,Styli style eyeliner,This eyeliner sucked. It seemed like it was half empty when I got it because it comes out very lightly. It's not the brand its just this specific eyeliner.
3,"Great Headphones, Horrible Mic","The headset is great except for one thing. I'd would totally agree with the guy that said the microphone cord sucks. I've been through 4 sets of these headphones. Everytime the mic has stopped working on each set. Drives me nuts! The headsets only get picked up from the desk, put on my head, and then back down to the desk. Not even heavy use... and they break. I contacted Altec Lansing and their reprsentative said that they do indeed have multiple reported problems with the mics going out. They said they will replace the headphones, but I will be without them for 4 weeks. Sucks! Look at another set of headphones if you'd like them to work longer."
4,"Great headset, but there are better","The speakers and the mic work great, but as mentioned they are a bit uncomfortable after long periods of time. By uncomftorable, I don't mean that they are painful or unusable, just not ideal. I still used them for several hours at a time several times since I bought them. Trying Sennheiser next."
4,Very please,My order came 3 days before the suspected earlier date. Packaging showed thought and care. The product itself of course was not perfect but has minor cosmetic damage. The vinyl itself plays beautifully and has no scratches what so ever.
2,The Battery Dies & You Are Screwed,"Had the player, a little funky to figure out but was working well. Works more like a hard drive than a music player, By that I mean it is not very Windows freindly. It has upgrades for the software, if you have a lot of music, the Moodlogic firmware upgrade is not a very good idea. The firward can really slow down the player.Sound quality is good.Warranty is 1 year. My player died at 1 year, 2 weeks. Player was $299 when I bought it.It took 7 calls, emails, and 1 fax from 9/27/05 until 11/08/05 to get a response, to my request to have it fixed.Response: It is out of the 1 year warranty, there is nothing we will do for you.$300 annuanly for a player is a rip offBUY SOMETHING ELSE"
1,Ugly and expensive and poor quality,"i can't believe who wrote these glorious reviews for one of the worst mp3 players on the market today. the ihp 120 is absolutely ugly. comparing it to the ipod or even muvo zen is an insult to the human race. my local electronics store had a couple of these and the salesman said everybody thought it was ugly... and way over-priced. the remote control is nice, but the sound quality is very, very poor. seriously, if you are considering a hard-disk mp3 player and want substance and style, go with the ipod. it's only slightly more expensive but lightyears ahead in both technology and design. this iriver is a total joke. this is from an unbiased end user not affiliated with either apple, creative, iriver or any other electronics makers."
4,What more could you want?,"I've had the IHP 120 for more than a week and find it an excellent value for the money. I have numerous books on it, as well as music.It took a little bit to get a handle on navigating, but that was due to the dizzying array of features more than the user interface. I also found that it's more intuitive to use the remote than the controls on the main component.Like most people I don't like the ear buds, but I don't like ear buds. A $10 pair of Koss' ""The Plug"" made me much happier.Sound is nice, radio is adequate (reception is decent but not fantastic), audio recording works great."
5,Better than the iPod and worth the money.,"Not much to say since other reviews say all about the player and more but, just wanting to say that I have not had any problems with this player and I've probably used it about 1-2 hours a day for about a month. Not a lot of time but it goes to show that at least it won't break down as soon as you open the package. This player is very much like the iPod but, I prefer it because it is cheaper and has better features than the iPod. So bottom line is, that iRiver has done a great job with this player and it's definitely worth the money you pay for it."
3,Good but not Great,"The iHP-120 does exactly what it needs to do and no more. The display is functional, but unimpressive, and at times just difficult to read. In addition, the overloading of buttons is confusing at first, but eventually one can be convinced that it is actually convenient.The battery life is great, probably as a result of the poor display.Finally, the device does not support any media device functionality to manage (synchronize) the device with a media library. It pretty much looks and acts like a storage device, which is great until you are trying to manage 1000's of songs.Don't plan on having your computer jukebox and iHP-120 work together,they won't.And don't waste time with support, there is none. If you buy one, I hope you don't have any problems."
5,Perfect Petzzz for any age.,I bought this Perfect Petzz for my 93 year old mother who has dementia.It is ideal because it brings back warm memories of years gone by.Many thanks.
3,craftsman,The product is average. They could improve it by having a specific slot for pencils and higher quality seams. I have had my belt for just over a month and the seams are starting to come apart.
1,"This price is ridiculous! I work at Wal-Mart, and it is $7 there!","Oops... I put my review in the title. lol You should just go to your nearest Wal-Mart if applicable, or visit their website. Trust me. You'll thank me for it.Resident Evil: Degeneration (Blu-ray Steelbook Bonus Disc) [Blu-ray]"
3,Better Than Expected,"As a long-time fan of the series, this was a pretty good movie. I had heard many bad things from friends, so I didn't go into it with high expectations, but it was better than I thought it would be. Not a great film by any means, but it sure beats Resident Evil: Apocalypse."
3,"It was good, too bad Claire didnt play a better part.","Animation is great, a little stiff here and there and amazing in some other parts. I think Claire could have done better, after all this is THE REUNION between Claire and Leon, the stars of resident evil 2 (video game). Leon looks a little different from re4, yes it does slow down after the airport but the G-virus is here too, along with a monster that is like the birkin monster from re2. Claire says she has a new boyfriend and Leon kisses any other girl but Claire, so i dont think we'll ever see them as couple in the future, too bad. It was good, they should make another one with CHRIS and Jill, now that would be cool. Resident evil fans from the first to the 4th game will enjoy it, the movie had some cool things it lacked some others but its WAY BETTER than the live action movies."
1,What the?,"Overall, boring, very boring. Way too much dialouge. I got confused as to what was really going on in the plot. The animation was sub-par and it's more fun watching a cinema scene on playstation 2. I am a resident evil fan, but this just didn't do it for me. :("
4,review'si,"i enjoyed this partiliy better than the other's, they didn't have the same feeling it seemed to miss somethingthank you"
3,Too tight!,I had to send my husband to Walgreens for a bigger opening boot!The one at Walgreens costs less and works so much better.
5,Dry Pro,"This really did the trick for taking a shower, and not getting the cast wet!! My son did put up with a bag over his leg for two weeeks, and then I finally found this product! Worth every penny!"
2,Not as helpful as I would have thought,"The overall layout of the book was confusing and it felt like the information jumped around. It was helpful on some points, but overall, I was not confident that it prepard me well for my exam."
3,PRAXIS,Good reference for those interested to take the PRAXIS. It gives you an idea about the different topics that you need to review.
2,Don't buy if you have a small filter.,"I figured that this ""adjustable"" wrench would fit in any oil filter because it is adjustable. Well that was not the case. it didn't even get near my oil filter (about 1 inch of space all around). So if you have a small oil filter DO NOT BUY this product. I tried everything to get this thing to fit around my oil filter and nothing worked. Trust me its not worth the headache if you have a small oil filter."
2,Didn't work for my oil filter,"This may be an unfair review, but the product didn't work for my own oil filter. It may work for others just fine, but I still have to give my 2 cents. Especially if your oil filter is deeper into the engine, I think you will have a hard time using this tool. I'm just going to have to take my car to the shop next time I change oil and ask them not to over tighten the filter, so that I can remove it by hand."
1,huge disappointment,"I was eager to try the ""to go"" powder because I recently fell in love with the bottled drink: Light, clean-tasting, just a little sweet and I had no problem with the artificial sweetener.Recommended usage is one tube of mix to 16.9 oz (1/2 mL) of water. I used a 20 oz bottle yet it was still sickeningly sweet (note: the water was chilled; after tasting, I put it over ice--still gross). But the worst was yet to come. 10 minutes after the two tastes, a HORRIBLE SPLENDA HEADACHE--much worse than any aspartame headache to date.Note: No problem with the sweetener in the other ""to go"" varieties I've tried. No idea why this pne is so horrid."
4,A1's first big song in New Zealand!,"A1 have visited New Zealand. Ever since they have this song has blown up here. You see and hear it everywhere. On the radio, on tv and people are always talking about it. It currently resides at #19 on NZ charts.Anywayz, onto my review. This song is my favourite out of all A1's releases (Even though I also like ""Take On Me"" too), because it's sooo damn catchy! I like the guitar beginning and their vocals. Ben sounds the best and Mark sounds good too. The video is kind of funny, kind of sad. They have great voices and it's a shame it's only now they hit it big. This is a catchy song that will be liked by all."
4,Very practical,"I would recommend this book for people who want a very practical ""recipe"" on the key communication pieces to produce for a comprehensive investor relations campaign, the key elements of a good shareholder letter, the key elements of an investor relations section on the corporate website. It also nicely explains what to consider to show company value and investment considerations for investors. It has a lot of practical check lists. The only negative, I wish the book was more substantial... it is a short book...The publisher should note that there is a huge mistake on the first page of the book where it says ""undervalued"" where it should say ""overvalued""..."
3,Accurate recipes,I would have liked it better if most of the pages weren't taken up with the chinese translation. Beautiful pictures and easy to understand. It even has pics of the typical ingredients used in Vietnamese cooking to give you an idea of what you need to buy.
4,Good tunes for your repertaire,NOT something I'd recommend for beginners. One reason I would mark it down is because it seemed to be advertized as being a good book for the intermediate begginers but I knew better. The reason I did mark it down was because the cd tracks sound like a computer program and not like a guitar. Overall pleasant short tunes.
2,dull as dishwater,This book was dull and I couldn't finish it. It had the same feel of other books I've read from red dress.
4,Endearing story,"Having just read the book, I was quite surprised to find a few negative remarks about it. I must say that I enjoyed the storyline and here Carole Matthews wrote yet another endearing story. Unlike some readers, I wasn't shocked about the actions of these protagonists: it made the characters all the more human. I couldn't put the book down when I was reading the final pages of this book. For those avid readers of Carole Matthews' books, if you liked this particular novel,do read the novel 'Let's meet on Platform 8'."
1,It's sold by Amazon but not sure if this is authentic product,"Well, I have used 2 bottles altogether now.and I bought it again cuz I love the scent.However, this one the box packaging looked okay but when I saw the glass bottle I should have doubted more.this bottle had some what bold lettering of the L'eau par Kenzo than my previous bottle so I thought maybe because it's new that it lettering is bold and sharp.I have been using it for two weeks now. No matter how much I put it on I can barely smell it. Before I only used 3 mists or 4 sometimes and it lasted all day.Finally this morning I concluded that this perfume is not authentic Kenzo product but fake one(I put tons of perfume all over me and on my cloth and after 4 hrs I can barely think that I used them on. I just sprayed from my old bottle(1 mist) that had some left over and the scent is stronger.Don't buy this here but purchase them at sephora or other retail stores though it maybe costly but worth it."
1,Avoid at all costs,"This is a terrible scale. It is horribly inaccurate. If you leave an item on the scale, the weight display starts going down by 1 gram increments until it reaches zero. This scale is absolutely useless and I returned it as fast as I could."
5,John Force biography,"Great book, covering much of his lengthy career, and touching on his daughter's as well."
2,In Case Anyone Wanted To Know.......,"After Brenden Fraser speaks with the man in the jail cell (God?), there is a hauntingly beautiful song playing in the background. This song is called Makambo by Geoffrey Oryema. Check out his music. Its all VERY beautiful.Just thought I'd help!"
1,One of my favourite movies,"I enjoyed this movie and have seen it many times,I particularly liked the scene when Brendan Fraser plays a Cuban drug lord. The music played in the background really sets the scene and I've been searching for it for many months,its a real shame that It wasn't included in the soundtrack. Just for the record the track is called 'Bem, Bem Maria' performed by the 'Gipsy Kings'."
1,More like a question,"I know the Latin song that is not included on the soundtrack is called ""Bem Bem Maria"" and the song at the end is called ""Change Your Mind"", but does anybody know the name of the song that plays while Elizabeth is playing pool and the cueball bounces down the stairs to Brendan's feet?The songs that most people would buy the CD for are not on the CD at all. Buy instead a Sister Hazel or Spanish Kings CD."
3,That Spanish song,"That ""spanish"" song you are referring to is called Bem Bem Maria by the Gypsy Kings. Buy the Best of the Gypsy Kings if you like that song. The entire cd is fantastic."
3,Song in my head,"I enjoyed the soundtrack, but was hoping a certain instrumental song, that I can't get out of my head, would be on it. It is the song when he is in jail looking out the window and thinking. It is a guitar song I believe, and sounds pretty cool. I would like to listen to it, so can anyone help me?"
3,Unfullfilled,"the soundtrack is lame. i wish it had more of the original score. I heard it but i didn't buy it. There is one song on the movie that i can't figure out. It's the latin one at the end of the movie where the credits are. It's after the sister hazel song ""change your mind"" if anyone can tell me what it is i would be thankful."
3,Bedazzled,"This CD is lame. What's there is fine, but a lot of the score of the film is missing, including the great cut from the end of the movie.The perc is being able to listen to Brendan Fraser's rendition of ""Inside of You Inside of Me,"" which is very dark and sexy and got cut from the film, which was lame in and of itself."
1,the existance of this book disgusts me,"i have not read this book nor would i want to. the existance of books like these is the reason why so many young homosexual men and women end their lives because they feel unaccepted and unloved by parents who believe in this rubish. it is a scientific fact that, especially in males, there is a gene that causes homosexuality; to make people believe otherwise is dangerous.*i would give this book no stars if that was a possible choice."
4,"Small, but fun.","If you're wanting to use it for a special time, definitely get 2. They are too small to be shared, but make a perfect single serving."
4,A great game for before a trip to WDW,"My 5 year old twins received this game for their birthday. We are planning our first trip to WDW and we thought this would be a fun game to ""learn"" about the Magic Kingdom. They LOVE it. We have played it almost every night. Since they can't read, Mommy and Daddy help them play. We help with the reading and which direction to go, but they roll and make all the decisions on the event cards. They are becoming familar with the attractions and are getting excited about our trip.I have friends who have gone to Disney many times that have this game too and their kids love it too.I plan on buying this game for my nephews who just went to WDW as a reminder of their trip. I am also buying this game for my Dad for Father's Day as WDW is his favorite place, and he is coming with us on our upcoming trip."
4,Little Guys Can Win too!,"I got this game for my 5 year old who loves Disney World. He loves to play it with his older siblings and father. He wins repeatedly and legitimately, which makes him feel great!"
2,A bit of a disappointment,"I found myself to be disappointed by this book. It had been warmly recommended to me from my reading group and since it had gotten an award, I expected more... At times, I really had difficulties going on with the reading ( I finished it because it was a group read). However, most of the book was totally unbelievable and the characters often behaved out of theír line of character. I smiled a few times but I never laughed out loud!"
1,Adolescent writing,"This book has a silly premise, stereotyped characters (the ditsy mother, the handsome love interest, the snotty sister-in-law-to-be) and a plot overwhelmed by the main character's constant whining. This belongs on a reading list for preteen girls who drool over weddings and Trixie Belden mysteries, which, by the way, were more interesting."
4,fun cozy,Funny book likeable heroine and a bit of fresh air. This cozy was great also kinda different from others and that is what makes it good.
4,Everywhere,My little girl has dough everywhere. Thanks a lot Barbie...LOL...She loves it though. Nice product.
3,There could of been more,"I was hooked from reading the first few pages. I just had to have this book. It is a good read, but it wasn't as great as I expected. I love books with scandal and mystery. This book lacked booth. The story was under developed and could have been great if the author explored the key characters more. The book lacked scandal and mystery b/c the answers were on the surface. The characters lacked depth. This was a good attempt for her first book. I hope she gets better and if the next book is a little better I'll continue to support her efforts."
3,In the Mind of Freddy,"AMC Biography's TV documentary on Fellini is a 50-minute review of the Italian cinema master. Fellini used his past and his dreams as his screenplays for his many lurid, colorful, even psychotropic masterpieces. He, perhaps, found relief in directing expensive, over-wrought classics like ""La Dolce Vita"", and ""8 1/2"". Sadly, it's impossible to truly explore this complex genius in 50 minutes, and this film doesn't even really try. We're left with long, extended interviews with an old Italian friend, and not enough clips from his hypnotic cinema works. There is only one brief scene from ""Satyricon"", and a glimpse of ""La Strada(They don't even mention Anthony Quinn's award)"".The film should be filled with clips from his works. Nevertheless, the subject is complex, and the attempt is very interesting."
5,Gates of Light,An interesting and complex book that one could read over and over and still not exhaust the information contained in it.
2,A satisfied customer!,The item color was not what it showed in the picture.It would't fit the seat also. The service was great and the return went very well. Thanks for the service.
3,Sheepskin Seat cover,"we can't put the seat cover on the driver's side and that is the area where we needed it for. now we will put it on the passenger's side. hopefully it will go on ok. We didn't order 2 at the same time, our mistake, we thought there were 2 there, that was not clear or maybe we didn't read that correc tly and then reasing the reviews, we know that if we order another one, they will not match. Other then that, when we start to use it, we will be in a better position to be able to say how well it works."
4,Great tag,"Let me start out by stating that Lucky Pet did a great job and offered quick service. I would have rated it 5 stars but the tag is thicker than I would have liked. It has large very clean, clear, and readable engraving."
3,Pretty Good,"This book is MJD in about third gear (as opposed to fifth, when she's really zooming). It is not as good as the first two of her ""Undead"" series, but she still manages to create amusing characters, interesting situations, and fairly snappy dialog.Not her very best work, but certainly worth a read."
1,Just plain awful,"While I was reading this book I kept wondering what this is supposed to be, a modern day fairytale maybe?I mean come on, Alaska being its own country, and the Prince getting married to some broke unemployed woman his father the King met on a fishing boat? She just has nothing better to do with her live and agrees to become the future Queen, including a lavish wedding with guests such as Suzanne Sommers, Kate Beckinsale, Prince Charles from England, and Princess Stephanie from Monaco.It might work as a children's book, if the f word hadn't been used all the time and the few sex scenes had been eliminated. But for an adult, who wants to read that? How about something a bit more realistic, just a bit would be good..."
3,"Good, if a little familiar","I loved the concept of ""The Royal Treatment"" - Alaska its own country, a commoner going from nobody to Somebody in just a few weeks. MaryJanice Davidson is a very creative person.But there's something that bothered me about this book, and it's Christina, the ""herione"" of the story. If you've read any other book by Davidson, you'll recognize this character in an instant: rude, obnoxious, not funny, ungrateful, but considered gorgeous and charming by the other characters. It seems like Betsy, Caitlyn and Christina are essentially the same person. This story could've been much better if Christina were less conventional of Davidson.That aside, it's an entertaining and quick read. You may want to borrow it from a friend or the library before buying it, but if you're a fan of the author or love the concept, check this one out."
5,Conjunto Primavera are the best Norteno performers.,I think that conjunto primavera is the best noteno performers because I like all the songs they have in their albums.I recomend to you all that like to hear good music to buy all cd's.
3,It's OK,"Como identificacion, el nombre es muy pequeno, al igual de los datos de los duenos.El tiempo envio fue bueno"
2,Poor quality engraving,"I ordered the brass bone shaped tag, and was very disappointed in the quality. The print is hardly etched in and seems more to have been printed. I don't think this tag will last in the long-term, and doesn't look good now. I would not recommend this product."
2,"Good choice of workouts, unfortunate choice of instructor","This presents of good variety of short workouts. Unfortunately, Ana Caban, who presents 4 of the 5 options, does a massively annoying voice over, really one of the most irritating I've heard. Only for those days when I feel like I can stand to listen to her!"
1,Not Enough,"I read the reviews of the first edition and thought I would give the author the benefit of the doubt - I should not have. The diagrams appear to have been corrected but I would not suggest this as a study guide. The practice questions contain more information which is omitted from the text than is actually included. The better description would have been a practice test a la SAT and GRE practice tests. If you think you are ready for the test, get the CD for practice. Otherwise, find another resource."
4,It's got some good recipes.,"I love the Wei Chuan series and own many of their books, this book is a nice addition to my collection I would've given it more stars if there were more recipes. It's a small collection which includes a lot of chicken, beef and shell fish recipes. It only has one lamb recipe and some vegetable dishes. I was looking for a more comprehensive cookbook."
1,Installing Issues,"This game does not come with an instruction manual. It sure needs one. I have tried installing this game on my computer for the last three hours and I still can't get it to play. I even downloaded the patch for the game and it doesn't work. I have tried tweaking with the video settings and I almost got to the title screen...but still no play. I can only imagine how frustrated parents might feel trying to install this game for their anticipating children and how many explatives might explode from their lips. In short, DON'T BUY THIS GAME!!!!!"
4,The view from planet Jennings,"Yes, this book is absurd, and yes it's surreal, but dear reader, this is a rare glimpse into a very unique mind of man. Through his characters, Jennings reveals to us a way of thinking, a view of the world, that I've never seen before. And it's facinating. Read it and enjoy it not because it resembles something else, but because it stands alone as an example of just how creative, inside out, upside down, and entertaining the human mind can be."
5,An authoritative blend of social history and culture,"The Scots have influenced American history from Viking exploration times to modern times, so it's about time they deserve their own focus - and in How The Scots Made America, author Michael Fry provides this in a survey of how Americans of Scottish roots helped shaped the country. Fry is himself Scottish and has been called 'Scotland's most controversial writer': his columns have long focused on Scottish-American history both in America and England, so he's in the perfect position to provide an authoritative blend of social history and culture."
3,"extended, but cute.","I was an extra in the dance scene (white shirt, purple pantaloons, mustache, sunglasses, alot of hair that is now gone). 20 years later, I decide to see the film. Not bad. I enjoyed seeing a young Wally Shawn, and although at times the movie was a bit drawn out, overall I enjoyed it."
1,Inner Journey: A Spirited Conversation About Self-discovery,"As I viewed this, I was aware of how wonderful I felt and how great it is to have someone talk about loving yourself and focusing on the real existance (breath): the breath that we take in every day and take for granted. Prem Rawat speaks the truth about the real joy, the joy of living. We so often associate joy to what we achieve, a love relationship and getting what we want. The joy of living is rarely spoken about. He is refreshing, real and allows us to keep it simple and just appreciate life itself. What a breath of fresh air in a world where so much is expected of us and where there is so much pain and suffering."
4,Keyboard platform,We ordered this as our new keyboard had little flimsy legs on it. My husband likes this platform as it is adjustable and has a nice wrist rest with it. We are pleased with the purchase.
4,3M tilt adjustable gel wrist rest platform,"I really liked this product. It's comfy to use, even without the optional ""legs"" that can raise the angle. I have it for my netbook, and it fits just fine. It's not a portable thing, and with a laptop, that would have been nice if they can make one that folds in half and tucks away in your bag. The leg pegs are nice to have the option for, but I didn't see a lot of reason for them myself....but that's just me.If you were to use this for a keyboard, I imagine that your wrists and arms will feel the decreased pressure and awkwardness of being held still without a rest.sturdy, nice product...and the antimicrobial protection is an added plus!"
3,"comfortable, but not remarkable","This is a reasonably comfortable keyboard rest with a gel pad for the wrist. But it's rather expensive for the purpose.The integration of the gel pad with the keyboard rest just makes it stay in place. Since most keyboards can be tilted, I don't see any other real value-add from the ""platform"" being tiltable. So if you want a gel pad for the wrist, you could consider a separate one, which might cost quite a bit less.I don't ascribe any value to the ""antimicrobial"" claim, having never gotten sick from using my own keyboard or any other desk items."
1,Horrible,The Mac version (6) just doesn't work like it should. I tried updating my company files from the windows version 2002- it took a great deal of time with tech support and there was no way it could be done by just reading the manual.The fatal flaw however is with the payroll module by Aatrix. This thing is horrible. I might as well use a spread sheet. It would be easier!
2,Too much talking,"Its not possible to instruct someone without talking but Mari doesn't really do many of the poses and uses her models, she talks way too much. I needed a change in my Pilates routine and this was not it. Kristen McGee's intro to pilates is much better and she is in there with you."
3,Button Order,"For me the description may have been a little vague. They are somewhat smaller, and my suspenders tend to come unsnapped in the rear. They don't appear as strong as those I have used in the past. I belive I would order another type in the future."
3,Really?!?!?!,Could several of these stellar reviews be written by the same person? Nahhh. Why would anyone do something that cheesy.
2,Disappointed,"I purchased two batteries. One of the packages was opened and the battery was loose in the shipping box. Upon charging both, one of the batteries did not work.Disappointed."
4,JWVHIII,"Entourage is clever and funny and has developed some of my favorite characters (the agent who seems to be such a shark but over the years has been written to reveal an inviable moral substrata)that I find very watchable. Watching Enourage enjoyability is specially improved when the ads and time between episode viewing is eliminated. Though the characters are all 'lost boys', thier 'Neverland' is the instant gratification world called Hollywood, the story line is both entertaining and interesting to watch. The writers are clever in developing unfamiliare scenarios that lead the viewer on new paths through the entetainment forest in a satisfying way that makes the casual nudity and adult theme an acceptable adjunct that supports the story and seems more natural than tittilating. The story is a dream world in which four Jersey boys are sprinkled with Tinderbell dust and fly off to a place that is totally unreal but so far facinating and fun to watch."
4,A Good Primer on Nonviolence and Objectivity to War,"This nice collection of articles, essays and pamphlets is a must for any High School or College course regarding Peace, Conflict Resolution, Political Structure, and War.There is a nice introduction to every piece to give the reader a decent context, and each article has a few follow-up questions for future insight."
5,Compact and Efficient,"The product is compact but still provides sufficient exercise for leg muscles, especially if walking is not an option. It also comes assembled, so one does not have to arrange for assembly--a very helpful factor."
5,Keep moving,"I use it twice a day just to get myself moving a little. I had two knee replacements, and this keeps them from getting so stiff."
3,"You get what you pay for, I guess.","Feels really cheap, but it didn't cost much, so... Frustrating that it moves across the floor at higher resistances, also gets hot after extended period of pedaling at med to high resistance."
2,5 Mile Fat Burning Walk,"I purchased this 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk DVD thinking it would be as good as the Walk Away the Pounds Express, and to be honest I am really dissapointed... This ""new"" DVD doesn't have the music that encourages to keeps walking, she has different wear in each mile, with different people around, or she alone... and the worst part, she doesn't use the stretching routine..."
4,High energy walk-fit program,I rate this program as very good. I was a little disappointed in the fact that it was done as 5 separate miles in the workout. I'd really like to see what a 5 mile workout would look like without the breaks between miles. I do work up a sweat though so I'm not complaining.
3,Easy to do,"This is the third DVD I purchased of Leslie, it doesn't feel like a person actually walks 5 miles and the 2 minute boosted walks are only 1 minute 30 seconds. Also I would rather Leslie walked alone then with some of her walkers like Brittany or Kristina in her 4 mile walk. Where do you find people like this? If you need to have people walk with you stick with people like Nicki she is definitely more mature and doesn't look like a geek and want to make you turn it off. Over all I love walking with Leslie and is the only exercise I have been able to follow and stick with. Just pick better people to walk with."
5,Leslie Sansone:Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk,"This was an excellent addition to my collection of Leslie Sansone videos! Each mile has it's own ""boost"" so you can do just one mile or all five and get a great workout. I particularly like the music this is set to...that makes a difference to me as to just how long the workout seems."
4,Leslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 mile fat burning walk,The DVD is a lot of fun. Would recommend it for someone who does'nt have time to walk outside.
3,Not my favorite Leslie,"I bought this DVD after reading a lot of the great reviews. I must say that I was disappointed.The Good:-Leslie! I like Leslie. She is her normal chatty self and she doesn't get on my nerves.-I like the boosted walking (ie:jogging in place.)The Bad:-Some of the walkers. Two of the walkers looked like they hated being there, and there was one overachiever who seemed to try to ""outshine"" Leslie. Distracting.-There were parts of the DVD where the music changed and the next song was not cued up. It was a long silence before the next song.-There were one or more times where the camera zoomed in on walkers instead of Leslie as she called for a change in steps.-There is no warm up.The Meh:-The group was not with Leslie through all the miles-The music. Nothing to write home aboutI really wanted to like this DVD because I am a Leslie fan. I have had such a good experience with Leslie's ""Fast & Firm: 4 Really Big Miles, and Ultimate 5 Day Walk Plan, but this one is lacking for me."
4,Great game,"great game. only issue with it is the resale of your cars are less than that of used chewing gum. Game play and graphics are top notch. I play this on a 46"" Samsung A550 and it is out of this world. Enjoy!"
3,"Stunning Graphics, Great Race Game, But missing some stuff","Let's keep in mind this is only a preview game and that's why it's half what the full version will run when it's released. The short review on this one is; I will buy Gran Turismo 5 when it comes out and if you are looking for a pretty decent driving game for the PS3, considering the price this is a good buy. It's fairly limited on cars and tracks, the graphics are stunning and the gameplay is typical of the Gran Turismo series."
3,Personal Opinion,"This a good PROLOGUE to this game, the graphics and the car simulation are improved.I am wating to have the complete game."
4,"Good game, cant wait for release","The game overall is what you would have come to expect from GT, however, not enough cars and the menu system seems sluggish if not downright irritating."
2,wait for the real game,"Absolutely stunning graphics and more realistic handling, but bear in mind that this is only the Prologue - a taste of things to come. Very limited cars and no tuning allowed :( I pretty much finished the game in 2 days.I hope they offer the full game as a download at a reduced price if you already purchased the Prologue."
2,This should not be sold as a complete game.,"I finally purchased this when I gave up on Polyphony Digital coming out with the full version any time soon. It's been over a year and still no GT5. realize that this has ""Prologue"" in the title, but even at the current price it's a bit lofty for what you get, let alone the fifty to sixty bucks it started at.One thing that was a big let down for me was the inability to upgrade your car. I've played every game in the GT franchise, and the thing that really hooked me with the first game was that I could turn a lame duck car into a real performer.This is essentially a preview of what's coming. If you're ok with paying this much money for a demo, go for it. Otherwise, exercise extreme patience for the real deal or probably a better option - find another game franchise to enjoy."
4,GT Prologue,"Very nice game, it's realistic and with excellente graphics the only thing i can complain is that there aren't much cars and it would be kind of nice a lot more options to personalize them."
3,Okay..its whatever!,"having played NFS series all my life, this was my first GranTurismo game experience.Honestly, I expected more out of GranTurismo5. it let me down.the product is fine and Amazon shipped it in great condition. but the game is mundane, and boring"
2,really dissapointing,"I've been a GT fan since GT3..I thought this game was going to be a blast!!! but it's way too far from older versions.Great graphics, yes, great sound and car handling, but is nothing compare to its predecessors. Too few tracks, poor rally options!!!"
2,nada que ver con Gran Turismo 5,"no puedes modificar los carros, no tiene tantos carros, pocas misiones, no tiene el modo B, muy basico, no me gusta"
3,Great game... not the price,I was hoping that GT5 would be a full version. Instead it was a watered down version that supposedly was going to be released within a year. A year has passed and they haven't made a version after the prologue. Oh well...
1,Sailboat Hull and Deck Repair,Good book with understandable illustrations and practical suggestions.
4,Proved a point for me,"I bought this book just to learn a little about epoxy, fiberglassing and techniques. This book covered a lot of ground and I keep it as a reference book. The book taught me that I will not attempt any big jobs but leave it to someone with more experience."
4,I would recommend it!,I started taking it 4 weeks ago ( 2 tablet /day) since I heard that together with DIM - which I have been taking as well - it is good against endometriosis and PMS. And I got light pain during my last period and only few clots.I gave 4 stars only since I am not sure if it would have worked the same way to correct my pattern if taken alone.I will definitely continue taking it and I would recommend it.
2,Falls out of the ear,"If you are looking for headphones that stay in then stay clear of these. Or perhaps I have big ears and thats why they keep falling out, especially when I am bike riding. Sound quality is also poor. Save your money and move along."
5,Baby Food Book Review,"This book is great. It give TONS of info on anything you could possibly want to know about feeding your baby and keeping him/her healthy. My favorite part is a section at the end which lists all fruits and veggies, what age they can be given, and how they can be prepared. Definite must for anyone who is interested in preparing home made baby food."
2,"Great start, but some major inaccuracies","This is a good book, in that is has a wealth of information, but I am alarmed by some of the major inaccuracies. As an environmental health professional, I am concerned by the recommendation of nuts (esp. peanuts!) to children under one year of age, as well as the suggestion to home prepare spinach, which is specifically tested by baby food companies for nitrates. Moreover, the suggestion of giving babies 8 months and younger finger foods seems a little premature. Many babies at this age have only had first and second foods and will find more texture difficult.Commercially prepared baby foods that are organic, and organic meats, are wonderfully healthy for babies, and I wish the author had been more attentive to these options.The information is good, however, in that few other resources exist. A more concisely written, substantiated book would be a very useful addition to the literature."
2,Baby Food...,This is one of two baby food books that I have. I did not like this book at all because it contains too many harsh statements that seem to be more the opinion of Yaron rather than proven scientific fact. It is comprehensive but I am using my other book which seems to provide a much more balanced approach to the world of feeding babies !
3,Good info,"THis book has a lot of good information and I have used some of it. I would have rated higher but we have been living in a hotel for the past couple months until our house is ready and haven't been able to use the information or make my own baby food because of our situation, but once we're in our house...I will definitely keep this book next to my cook books."
3,Microwaving food destroys nutrition,"I found that this book does have some neat reipes, but I must agree with others who have reviewed the book; it is quite wordy. And when you're trying to take care of a baby (and older siblings) that is not what you're looking for. Also, if this author cares so much about nutrition, I am surprised that she recommends microwaving food. Microwaving anything pretty much removes any nutritional value it had and adds radiation. The stovetop is often just as fast as the microwave and heats food much more evenly."
3,Mediocre At Best,"A health nut who has no credibility, education, or research to corroborate her information, claims that her Super Diet is responsible for her children's perfect health and genius brains. She herself admits that she has no research to back up the diet she is promoting, but ""let some scientist prove me wrong!"" No one is going to argue that a diet rich in whole grains and fruits and veggies is bad for anyone, but her methods of educating the masses could use some polishing. She has a ""tip"" for absolutely everything, (example: how to clean up after an egg has dropped on the floor, or how to get your librarian to obtain a book that the library doesn't have) and the poor structure is annoying. Her information about preparation and storage of a huge variety of foods is very helpful, but take the information about what to feed baby and when with a grain of salt, knowing that she is not an expert."
1,Not what I expected,I was looking for practical information on how much and what to feed my baby. I was not necessarily going to make the food. Only buy this book if you are planning on making the food and if you are familiar with health food stores.
1,DISAPPOINTING,"this book is very preachy and judgemental. wastes a lot of space being WAY too wordy and gives ""tips"" on all sorts of things that 99% of readers don't need a ""tip"" on -- as well as huge sections on arts and crafts and other stuff unrelated to 'super baby food'. eliminate all of that extraneous info/wordiness, and you could reduce this door stopper book to 1/4 of its size! another gripe is that the section on meat is so obviously anti-meat that she makes you feel like you need a haz-mat suit to prepare this evil ingredient! please! finally, a lot of her info is incorrect (especially the ages of introduction for various foods)."
5,Great book,"This served as a great resource for my son and I plan to use the book again for my daughter. Since I gave my prior copy away, I'll need to buy a new one."
3,Great resource but hard to follow,I didn't realize that this book was a vegetarian diet when I got it. It is really hard to follow the way it is written. Every paragraph tells you to refer to another page. The knowledge is so in-depth that you loose track of what you are reading. I do really like to refer to it as a resource to learn how to cook and store a particular food and what nutrients are in that food.
2,Dreary,"The book spends more time setting out menus than actually on the recipes and food preparation. The nutritional information is inaccurate in many places. The tone is condescending, and, quite frankly, it's a dull read."
5,Super Baby Food - great guide for making your own food,"This is a great book for Type A mom's ready to introduce organic solids to their baby. It's a fantastic guide for making your own bulk baby food. There is an extensive glossary in the back for details on how to pick, cook, and store specific fruits and veggies. On the other hand, I do agree with past reviewers in that the some high allergenic foods are introduced too early. You need to double check her list. [...]"
2,GET READY TO GET PARANOID,"I love my baby and want to give her the best, but let's be realistic. Desiccated liver? Hydrolized vegetable protein? Way too much information, way too much paranoia, way too much guilt. I've been a vegetarian for over ten years and believe strongly in the benefits of healthy eating, especially for my beautiful daughter, but it doesn't need to be this complicated.I admire the thoroughness of this book and respect how much Ms. Yaron cares for her children. I just don't think most people will have the time or inclination to follow all her suggestions. Do yourself a favor and get a simpler book."
5,What A Comprehensive Book!,"I had a baby a year ago and still use this book. It's an excellent source of everything involving baby nutrition, which most pediatritions don't seem to know much about. The author gives excellent tips on how to make your own healthy, baby food as well as a guide to when it's ok to start feeding different fruits, veggies, etc.. It's really indispensible, especially if you're a 1st time mom and you want to do everything right. My child has never been sick. I believe it has a lot to do with the good food I feed him."
4,not idiot proof...but if you have half a brain it's a great book!,"This book is great IMHO on preparing home made foods and gives lists of allergy foods to beware of...however, as you read the book if you don't referrence the allergy pages, then you would assume she suggests feeding those foods early on, it's an easy mistake and IMHO could have been written better, but if you don't already know these things, you shouldn't be raising children (and probably aren't buying a book on home made healthy foods...you're probably at McD's ordering a happy meal) If you referrence those allergy pages, you would realized she does know nuts and various foods should not be introduced early, especially if there is a history of allergies in the family. I agree with others that it's confusing if you're completely unaware & there are too many 'extra' words in the book, but those that can find the 'meat n potatos' of the book and skip the 'fluff' it's an excellent book! :)"
3,Good for reference and toddlers only,"This book is a great reference for when to begin introducing certain foods to your baby. However, I was disappointed that the recipes were meant for toddlers. I hoped to find recipes to feed my 6 month old, but there weren't any. If I had known that, I would have gone with a different baby book."
4,Goods Tips,I read this book when my daughter was around 6 months old. It is rather overwhelming with all the info but if you just take what you want from it and don't do everything recommended then you won't feel overwhelmed. Also run everything by your pediatrician first before introducing a new food. Two things I took from the book: brown rice super poridge and egg yolks. My baby is now 9 months old and has NEVER been sick!
4,Lots of great suggestions,"This is a very informative book for making your own food. Not as effective as a quick reference guide, but very useful information for making your own food.Would highly recommend this book for someone who is thinking of making their own baby food."
4,Great Customer Service,"When I originally received my purchase, I was not pleased. I contacted the seller by email and they immediately responded. I have been very pleased with the way they handled my problem and the overall customer service. So much so I would buy from them again."
4,My love hate relationship with this book,"Ruth Yaron has purged everything she knows about feeding children, from dishwasher operation to nutrition in this book. She recognizes that people may disagree with her (and I do heartily, on occasion) and she even states how you might disagree with her. The book often rambles.BUT, I can't live without it. I finally purchased the book after checking it out from the library multiple times. I haven't found another book with such incredible feeding charts and schedules, ideas for adding nutrition to homemade cereals, and so many ideas for easy baby food storage.I wouldn't take every Yaron says as gospel truth, but this is a great resource, especially if used in conjunction with a trusted pediatrician's advice."
2,Too many references,"I agree with some other reviews. This book offers helpful information on any topic related to feeding your baby/toddler and recipes for making your own baby food. But it is a very difficult read: every paragraph makes reference to another page/chapter in the book. One might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. So if you're up for sifting through all of the references to other places, you could find some valuable information. I found it tedious. Also if you are a meat lover like me, overlook the author bias against meat."
2,Vegan baby food,"Beware before you buy this book, it is for vegan and egg recipes only, the author doesn't believe in giving babies any meat or chicken. In fact it goes on about her own special diet substituting tofu, eggs and yogurt for meat. She doesn't believe in vitamins but does believe in iron supplements since your baby won't get enough iron without red meat. Two thirds of this book are useless to me since I have no intention of withholding protein and iron rich meats from my baby."
2,Confusing and time consuming to figure out,"I bought this book in hopes that I could prepare some food and as a basic guide to help me with what to feed my twin girls. I was confused most of the time. I kept reading about this wonderful ""Super Porridge"", but have yet to find a well-written out recipe for it and then have the substitutions/adding of ingredients to follow. It also has you referencing so many pages, you might forget where you started. It was just not the book for me."
3,Not for a child with food sensitivities/alergies,"I breast fed my baby solely for the first 9 months of his life. He broke out with terrible excema at the age of 3-months. After experimenting with my own diet, we realized dairy and wheat were the culprits. We later realized he had an egg allergy as well when I gave him egg yoke at around 7 months old per the author of this book. Now my 11-month old is handling soy formula well and is a hearty little carnivore. We have been experienting with a lot of finger foods. I recently looked to this book for recipes to give him a little variety in his diet. Unfortunately, Everything is made with egg, cheese and some sort flour or wheat germ. I would expect something like brown rice pancakes to be allergen free or atleast have subsitutes since the author does touch on foods that children can be allergic to. Overall the book is helpful and a good guide but I don't reccommend following her advise in a strict manner. You could get yourself or your baby in trouble."
4,Good reference book,"My favorite part of this book is the list of fruits and veggies -- how to select, freeze, puree, etc. I referenced that many times daily with my first child. It also helped me learned to cook my own baby food, which turned out not to be that difficult, really quite fun, and made me feel good that I was serving my baby healthy food. Also, more cost-effective than buying jars. After awhile, I noticed the tips on activities as well. BUT, I wouldn't use it as a bible -- she suggests some things that go against current thinking, like serving nuts earlier than a pediatrician would recommend. And, she is a bit long-winded in alot of the book -- she could get her point across more succinctly. Of course, looking at the length of my review, I probably could take my own advice! Anyway, good book if you are interested in making your own baby food, but keep learning outside this book as well."
5,More Than Just a Cookbook!,"This book is so PACKED with information, it's hard to call it just a cookbook. But even if I wasn't a ""mom"", I would have bought it. Where else could I find how to make homemade wheat flakes and crackers and step by step easy, easy directions on baking bread. Well, maybe in cookbooks at the Health Food Store but not as fun, informative and simply put as this."
1,Just Horrible; Do not waste your money.,"Read all online reviwes on this book, but was not convinced either way and wanted to find for myself..........Boy, I would agree 100% with everybody who said that this book was BADLY ORGANIZED, MISLEADING, POORLY WRITTEN. I have a very picky eater and need suggestions on how and what to cook so that she'll eat. Well, I've learned nothing. Yaron's book is for a baby who eats everything no matter how bad it is.PLEASE, DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY ON THIS ONE. TRUST ME."
2,The cover falls off!,"We bought the book, cover fell off, sent it back. Got a new book, cover fell off, sent it back. Tried one last time (got it directly from the publisher this time) and guess what! The cover falls off. May be a good book, but this experience has been pretty frustrating."
4,A great resource,"I agree- Ignore the negative reviews. As with anything (and as suggested by the author), you should always check with your pediatrician...That said, I have found this book to be a wonderful resource. It has easy-to-follow tables that say when it is safe to introduce which foods and how much to feed at what age. There are comprehensive guides explaining how to prepare each food, how to best store them, etc.I work full-time, and have found it very easy to make all of my son's foods, especially using some of the short cuts suggested in this book. Yes, it is wordy, and yes there are parts that could have been left out or scaled back, but I read it cover to cover and learned a lot!"
1,Very Disappointed,"I ordered Smoke paprika, unfortunately i received regular sweet. I called and spoke with a gentleman, who promised to send me the smoke paprika and apologized for the mistake made. Until today (1 month maybe 2 later) still haven't received anything or heard from the company. Very disappointed."
5,Great but Xpensiv,"Ok this is a great add on to any 98 and is great for scenario play and what they say is right, it just screws right on. But if you go to Ebay, you can get a brand new one, never used, and has more hols in it so it is quieter for half the cost. Or you can get the package(barrel stock sight) for $100+$10 shipping when normally the package is about $150. I bought mine from WarpedSportsKc and they were great, fast shipping, no problems, and it is an actual Ebay Store so you know it is not just any person trying to get your $. They have a 99.9% rating out of like 4000 people. So do not buy this from here buy it from Ebay and WarpedSportsKc. Just look up their store on Ebay."
4,Good Mil-Sim barrel!,"I bought this barrel for my Bravo One because I wanted a longer barrel, that kept the Mil-Sim look and that didn't cost too much! This barrel gave me more range and accuracy, it was exactly what I wanted for just about 35$. It was super easy to install but DO NOT OVERTIGHTEN because it's a bit fragile!"
2,"Great tuner, awful antenna.",The very small antenna is absolutely useless. The tuner itself is great if you have another antenna or cable to use with it.
4,Fab Fourth,"I would agree wholeheartedly with 'Santa Fe' about this performance of the Beethoven 4th...outstanding. Excellent sound quality too for a live 1979 recording.The andante of the 5th symphony really dragged for me, and the introduction lacked impact. So, 5 stars for the 4th and 3 for the fifth. It's tough to pick a 'best' Beethoven's 5th from the hundreds of recordings. My first choice would probably be Carlos Kleiber, a justifiably praised recording. If one can live with the sound quality, I think the WWII Furtwangler Berlin recording is outstanding."
3,Pleasantly surprised,"I kept hearing ""The Secret Garden"" on my favorite Smooth Jazz radio station but the local music store advised the CD was out of print. I found a copy in a used store and discovered Tony Guerrero is a talented musician and deserves a better break than he has been given. It is not a great CD but is even throughout, with ""The Secret Garden"" standing out. Hopefully, Mr. Guerrero will find a producer and ten or eleven great tracks to thrill us with in the near future."
2,WHAT A BORE!!!!!,"What a bore! What's the point of all those repetitive announcements (in Spanish too!) and the same intro to all the segments? Surely anybody would want to listen to this through without those annoying interruptuons. I think the fact that so many second-hand copies for sale on Amazon speaks for itself!What was needed here was somebody to have the guts to wield a knife and tidy this awful mess up! Nothing wrong with the music per-se, just the way it's been presented for the sake of 'completeness'. I have heard that there's a UK label that had put out an edited version of this last year. Anybody got any news on that? That *would* be interesting...."
4,Comfortable and easy to use,"This has been the ear piece for cellular phones w/o bluetooth. Best Buy quit carrying it and I was very happy to find it in Amazon. My dogs have a tendency to find thing I don't want them to chew, so I am grateful I can find it at Amazon."
2,Looks better than it works,"Pros: Sharp-looking. Supposedly reduces noise from wind.Cons: Very difficult to get this to go on and stay on your ear (an over-the-ear design would probably have worked better). The 'windsmart boom' is basically a plastic tube with a baffle at the tip...when you talk into it, your voice must travel up the tube to the mic in the headset. And guess what happens? People think you are talking in a tunnel (because you basically are).Not recommended."
1,Does NOT fit Nokia 6010,I bought this battery because every description says that it fits the Nokia 6010. It does NOT! It rattles around in my battery compartment with half an inch to spare in each direction. When I returned the battery for refund I only got a partial refund too! Not my best Amazon experience!
2,Not what I expected ...,"I bought this book thinking I would get two great biographies in one about two of the most fascinating leaders in history. The information that was provided on both of them was simply nothing new. What bugged me the most about this book, however, were the ""lessons"" a leader was supposed to learn from the mistakes and/or good decisions that each of them made.I couldn't find a ""lesson"" that was ever presented with more depth than ""Lee did this and showed good leadership. Do what Lee did and you'll be a good leader too.""Aacckkkkk! I found myself not concentrating on the book itself because of these simplistic statements so I finally quit reading it.If you're looking for a good biography and comparison of Lee and Grant, this is not your book."
4,Smooth,The book was in great condition and arrived timely. I would definitely buy from this vendor again! Thank you.
2,"BEWARE: NOT 7"" IN DIAMETER; IT'S 7 INCHES TALL!","The product description says this is a 7"" ball. This would lead one to believe that the ball itself is 7"" in diameter. However, the ball is only about half that size and the entire unit, base included, is 7"" tall - much smaller than I was expecting. The description is misleading and I'm quite disappointed as this was purchased as a Christmas gift and it's too late for me to return it. Even the product packaging looked like it had been opened already. I have purchased countless products through Amazon and have always been satisfied except for this time. Please, at least change the description so others are not misled. What a letdown!"
2,Pretty looking but bad quality,"This toy, when it works, is very nice. The colors are vibrant - gorgeous, even.However, the quality is quite shoddy. My on/off button is very finicky. I have to toggle it to the exact right location to get it to stay on, which is somewhere between ""on"" and ""off"". Sometimes if it moves out of this exact position, it just shuts off on its own.I'm disappointed, but it was only $[...], so, I can't complain much."
2,Not that great,"For Jeremy Strong's usual writing standard, this book is not that great. It is just average.The story is about how one renegade substitute teacher, Miss Violet Pandemonium, who drives a second hand ambulance, turns the stale environment of Witts End Elementary School, into a lively and fun environment.There's of course the usual villian in the story - Ms Earwigger, who is the deputy head teacher of the school. She tries her best to put an end to the merry making resultant of Violet Pandemonium's way of teaching and extent of influence on the other classes in the school.Yet another predictable teacher story, but lacking the excitement of those teacher stories that make it to become movie blockbusters, this book is an ok read."
2,Should have listened,"I needed a garment rack for temporary use so I did not want to spend a lot of money. I came across the Whitmore Deluxe Adjustable Garment rack, read the good and bad reviews and decided to try it anyway, maybe I'll have good luck. No go. It has fallen at least 2-3 times. It's like a balancing act. I should have listened and kept the box to return it."
5,A great Deep Purple album,"Come taste the band is one of the best albums from DP which consists of David Coverdale,Tommy Bolin,Glenn Hughes,Ian Paice and John Lord.This terrific album consists of Two cd"" of the best music made by Deep Purple and is highly recommended."
5,Nice quiet fan,Great fan. Remote is super nice. Many options on this one. Offers nice cool breeze. Really cools off the room.
4,Great,Love it! I'm in a small apartment that gets warm quickly. This fan is quiet and light. I can move it around to the room I need it. Even on oscillating mode it's quiet enough to keep on all night. And great price!!
2,"Flimsy, Unstable","I was very disappointed with this model. Don't bump into it because it might tip over, and that's on a hard surface. I can't imagine placing this on a carpeted floor. It does run quietly, but overall, it's just more cheap plastic junk."
3,FIGHTINGFALCON1685@YAHOO.COM,NOT THE BEST BUT CLOSE TO IT. I'VE BEEN TO CONCERTS OF DEEP PURPLE AND HAVE MORE MEMORIES OF OTHER SONGS THAT WERE NOT INCLUDED...............
2,Not what I expected,"I was extremely disappointed, I think I did not read reviews before purchasing it, I thought it was a movie not knowing it was staged, from beginning to end was quite boring. (A Mother's Prayer"
1,"THIS IS NOT A MOVIE, I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS BUT I HATE IT",I REALLY DID NOT LIKE IT I JUST SO THE BEGGINING IT WAS MOST THAN ENOUGH I DID NOT LIKE IT
1,A Mother's Prayer,"This was so bad, the actors were not, just the plot and the way they went about it. Sorry, I would not recommend this play to anyone."
2,Not Very Interesting,"This book really needs improvment. I mean, the story has absolutely NO action! It is about three kids, Monk, Scho,and Glennie playing a game of catch,and then Scho all of a sudden, starts acting silly and stupid and said that he controled Monk and Glennie and made them do whatever he wanted them to do. So they that made Monk came up the branches to where Scho was, and pushed him off the apple tree.I can't really recommend this book to anyone because adults will think that this book is boring and kids won't understand the GIANT, BIG long words that are in this book. So what I am basically saying is, don't buy this book!Thank you very much. Your time is appreciated!"
1,breaks easily,The first one I ordered arrived broken. The second one cracked in two in a 400 degree oven even though it is guaranteed to take 500 degrees. Need I say more?
5,thorough research,"I've followed Heather Macdonalds wonderful writing in the city journal. This book is thorough researched and well argued and quite relevant to questions of ethnic profiling (what it is, what are the limits?) that will affect us all in the future."
4,physicians guide to pharmaceutical compounding,A must for pharmasists and physicians concerned with compounding drugs for more personalized care. This book brings to light some of the alternative medicines along with the conventional. Dr. Ghen's approach to medicine brings back the belief that you must treat not only the problem but the individual.
1,Do Not buy for use with a Video Camera!,"I bought this to clean the heads of my old Sony hi8 Handycam 8 millimeter video camera. Unfortunately, this tape is not for video cameras, it is for cleaning the heads of tape drives (remember the old computer back-up systems?). This does nothing when you insert it into a video camera. I learned the hard way and did research and found that the only product still on the market is the Sony V8-25CLD cleaning tape for hi8 / 8 millimeter. I think the V8-25CLD is intended for digital video cameras (my sony is from 1996 so analog), but it seems to work with both analog and digital 8 millimeter video cameras.I think the seller of this product should be a lot clearer about what this product is actually for, so it is deceiving."
4,Sexual,"I admirer Spike Lee's movies. He set the bar high for african americans cinema, his films have interesting subjects. This was his first film and you can see he talent in the beginning. She's gotta have it, i know alot of females who act just like the female in this movie. They're horny and they can get any guy. I enjoyed this movie and i usually don't like black and white films"
2,Just flat-out bad!,"I have to admit that I loved 1999's Golden Arms Redemption and this was a huge letdown. It is full of guest appearances by the extremely untalented Hillside Scramblers. I was hoping for more U-God. And I was hoping for more than 1 dope beat. This is just awful. I tried to listen to it and enjoy it, it's just impossible."
4,Excellent monitor for the money,"I've owned other ViewSonic monitor, so this was all I expected for a basic, low-cost, flat screen monitor."
2,Pretty Hum-Drum Stuff,"Although this was published under the ""Mask Noir"" imprint, it's more of a thriller set just prior to the Gulf War, than a mystery per se. The story is about an embittered British radar technician who is inexplicably fired from his job in England. He soon finds himself unwittingly (at first) in the employ of Iraq in modifying a radar system so that it can detect stealth aircraft, and thus protect the Republican Guard. There are all kinds of standard thriller complications: a Palestinian ""honey-pot,"" a CIA ""watcher,"" an likable elderly father, etc. The book skips around a bit, sometimes in first-person by one of Saddam's attendants, sometimes in first-person by the CIA watcher, sometimes in a Pentagon meeting, but it mostly follows the radar tech. The attempts to portray the Americans are fairly clumsy, and the Palestinian girl's motivations seem to be awfully flexible. Pretty hum-drum stuff, all in all."
5,Des'ree is simply fantastic.,"She has simply outdone herself. The way in which she sings this song captures the true essence of love and emotion. It's completely soul shattering! ""Kissing you is truly the greatest love song of all time."
5,Great Controller,"I bought this controller for $9.99 after rebate from Circuit City. I used rechargeable AAA batteries in it worked great. Please note that if there is not continuous gameplay after several minutes you might have to hit the connect button which will reconnect the controller to the Xbox in seconds. However, I have not gound it to be an inconvenience."
5,Perfect moose,My daughter wanted her moose (Sweet Marlon) to have a baby moose and this was perfect. Size was exactly how I wanted it and the way it sits was exactly like her other moose.
4,This is a good book but could have been better,"This really is a good book for beginner's guide to home buying. It is very easy to read and understand. After going through it about two times, I had a general understanding about what should be done.one thing I wished the author had done is about short sales, REOs, and foreclosures. I bought a house in 2009 while the housing market was in depression and I think it would have been a lot more helpful if he included more explanation about those kinds of properties.Overall, recommended"
3,Middling effort in an excellent series,"The essays are for the most part dull and poorly written and - even worse for essays - insincere. The material is, again, dull and seemingly selected by Gould to bother his readers. There are two uncomfortable essays about death made more discomforting in the one case (Franzen's essay about dementia) by his sad lack of sympathy for his subject (his own father). Then there's Gore Vidal's apology for Tim McVeigh: a simple agenda piece that has no place in an essay collection.There is one notable exception. The essay on cellos is surprisingly warm and funny and finally tender. It was a fine example of the form and may well turn up in the Century's Best, come 2101."
3,Heavy,"Just a quick warning, this thing is heavy. The battery pack is a lot of weight. Go to the store and pick it up in your hands to feel for sure. For the price of this and the Roady2, you might as well get the portable unit to begin with."
2,Avoid this item,"In theory, this is a great idea. However, once I purchased it and tried it at home, I was severely disappointed. The bottom line is that the reception is awful, unless you in an open field. The antenna in the headphones is not adequate, and I found that it was next to useless indoors. Unless you are right next to a window, the signal is very intermittent. Maybe Delphi will put out a better unit in the future. Both this and the docking station seem to be great ideas that are not very good quality items."
1,Delphi XM Roady2 Personal Audio System,The item advertised was misleading. The picture shows the receiver. It was not clear the the receiver was 'not' included.
1,Save your money,What a piece of crap. Horrible reception even in the open outside. Max volume is way to low and headphones are uncomfortable and wear out way too fast.
2,just a rehash of the official CC documentation,"If you are looking for a book that will help you get started on the tortuous painful path to a CC certificate, save your money. This is just a rehash, in Potomac bureaucratese, of the extremely unenlightening and totally unhelpful documentation that's available for free on the CC website. And of course it's WAY out of date."
5,First Train Set,I purchased this train set for my 3 year old son. He was able to put the track together himself and played with it for hours. The cars have magnets on them so they stay together easily and are the perfect size for little hands. He enjoys this toy so much I plan on purchasing it for my nephew at Christmas.
3,Lots of Details; Lots of Quotes; Not so much of value,"An avid fan, I grabbed up Sid's book as soon as I could. It was a quick and moderately interesting read; but it was not have the sort of work I was hoping for. The bulk of the work was given over to reminiscence from current and former members; as well as a Track by track walkthrough of each mainstream album. Sid certainly did a good job assembling the material and it is comprehensive, but it does not analyse the music nor its place in music as much as one would wish. I was left wanting alot more; still it may be just me. I dont think Sid intended to write the book I wanted to read. Worth it for a fan."
4,Promising Debut,"An uneven, but enjoyable debut by Mr. Adachi!This coming of age story centers around Yurika Song, a half-Japanese, half-Korean young woman who comes to New York to stay with her Korean relatives. Exiled to America by her exasperated parents due to her wild lifestyle back in Japan, Yurika works at her uncle and aunt's deli and soon becomes friendly with the bike messengers who come in daily.Adachi has a wonderful style of writing. With a few choice words, he throws you into the fast-paced, liberating world of bike messengers, the quiet rapture of Yurika's love of the English language, and the mean-spirited, claustrophobic life of Yurika's aunt. Plotwise, the story lags after the first half, but I was driven to finish nonetheless and eagerly await the next book out of this author."
3,Very 101.....,"This was an okay book. I thought this would be more of a decorating and spell book, but I can't call it that. It's just a very gerneral Pagan book that does cover a lot of information that's in many Wiccan or Pagan 101 books already. The Feng Shui system was interesting, but it's in conflict with some other feng shui books, although this was easier to understand and use.I bought this used and while I don't consider it a waste of money, I can't reccommend it to others. Magic House is a great decorating book, and Magical Household by Scott Cunningham is amazing, everone should have copy, it's more lore and spells, everyone can learn from this book. There are many Pagan home books, search and search some more.I give it a C."
3,Too general to be of much use,"The author covers many different systems for making a house ""work"" physically and spiritually, but not in any real depth. The book's focus is extremely broad. Despite the reference in the title, the witchcraft angle is downplayed quite a bit, as there are numerous Christian references. I'm sure this gives the book wider sales appeal, but at the expense of providing a detailed treatment on any topic. It would make a cute housewarming gift, maybe, but buy books which specifically cover Feng Shui, herb lore, candle magick, etc if you want in-depth information. Cunningham's ""The Magical Household"" is a better bet if you're looking for general information on how to make your house a magickal home."
3,Too generic,"I have to say this book was rather a disappointment to me in its generic approach to witchery in the home. Although not a bad book per se, I found it a bit confusing. It starts out basically as a book about decluttering, organizing and home decorating and then suddenly switches to astrology. The section on decluttering promulgates the 'less is more' philosophy which, unfortunately, is a theme that extends throughout the book. In other words, don't expect to find any detailed spells inside to try out this weekend. The magick in this book is more implicit than explicit; more feng shui for the anal pagan than house spells for the magically inclined. The author also seems to have a personal vendetta against toilets, claiming there's no good place in the home to have one.I don't plan on visiting her anytime soon."
3,"Good scent, better off spending more for the cologne...","This is a great scent, but I found that the Toilette Spray is WAY too light & you can't smell it at all after application (mind you, I'm not the kind of girl that likes to be preceeded by her fragrance.. I like a nice 'barely there' scent) - spend your money on the cologne or perfume, you'll get a much better application."
3,Not Bad..Not Great,"The removable, washable cover is a plus, but the length is a little shorter than Contour Products television commercials would lead one to believe. Comfortable, but at $19.99 other products are just as good for less $$"
2,So-So Pillow,"Pillow is bulky for travel. The foam is not ""memory"" foam but is fairly comfortable. My biggest complaint is that the ""twist"" feature is really just a couple of notches than bend. There is excess foam at the ends of the pillow that are just sort of hanging there. Comfortable enough, but it's not really any better than your regular travel pillow."
4,seems great for airplane travel,"I just received this pillow and have not yet used it for travel, but it wins over the simple u-shaped neck pillow that i had before. This gives me the opportunity to shape it to my neck and head, as well as sleeping position (upright, against the airplane window, etc). Most importantly,it is higher on the neck and face when sleeping, which keeps the head in a more upright position.The only drawbacks are: the HUGE tag sewn into the pillow cover, i.e. I just proceeded to cut open the pillow cover, because I cut out the tag.The ends of the pillow are not shape-able, meaning you can only shape the middle part of the pillow, as mentioned by another reviewer. This seems different than advertised (""fully articulated"", referring not to the full length of the pillow, I guess)Also, I saw similar pillows selling for $5 less, but they are narrower, so probably not as good in propping up the head on a long flight."
2,Not big enough,"I was disappointed in this pillow. It is not quite fat enough to support my head. I am keeping it, though, for my kid to use later."
4,Good Quiet Time Music,"I like this CD very much, it is good relaxing music.The only thing I don't like is the fact I can't rip it into my computer - that is very annoying because that was one of the main reasons I purchased it - so I could add it to my Calm Music MP3 compliation on my computer. Because of this I won't be purchasing more of Kevin Kern's music."
5,"Beautiful, relaxing c.d.",Wonderful c.d. that is calming and beautiful to listen to. It really does remind me of a solitude walk thru a forest. Very relaxing!!
4,The best game ever!,"This game is really great. It is a great sequel to Jak and Daxter. The graphics are unbelievable. The gameplay could be better, but it is good. The sound is decent. You might only get it if you got all of the power cells in the last game. Or you might not understand the time rift thimg. There are 4 weapons. My personal favorite is the vulcan fury. Buy this game right now!"
5,WOW,"I played it and I was blown away!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Its awsome. You have guns and can steal cars,+ u have a hoverboard. Its like gta. Its better the ratch & Clank 2. Way better than the 1 one. First one sucked!"
2,How hard do you have to make a game?,"This is one hard game! Jesus, and with no real cheat codes around to help. Most levels, you have to replay it so many times to beat the level. That is if you could.Tell you the truth, it is so frustrating playing this game!"
2,good idea to rent before you buy,"For anyone who has played the original Jak and Daxter know that Jak II is a very different game. It's MUCH darker and much harder too. A reviewer in a game mag reported that 'Jak II requires excellence in players'. If you want a game that you can play and enjoy while you're playing it, get Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando. If you want a game that will easily frustrate you, get Jak II. Both are rated 'T', but as far as I'm concerned Jak II has it for a more logical reason w/it's realistic guns and bad language compared to Ratchets cartoon-type guns and no bad language. I may try Jak II, but I'm definately buying Ratchet and Clank: Going Commando! Maybe one day gaming companies will realize that not all gamers like games like GTA!"
3,A single flaw destroys this game,"The game plays well, graphics are good for its era, and technically its sound. The gameplay is fluid, and it seems like a solid game overall.But the fact that the missions have no checkpoints destroys this game. The missions are difficult, albeit not extremely so, but the lack of checkpoints makes it incredibly frustrating as one tiny mistake takes you back ten, fifteen minutes to the beginning of the level and forces you to do everything again. Compound that with the fact that it takes literally 2-4 shots to die, and you'll be playing every mission again and again and again...The missions themselves are fine, but the lack of checkpoint system was so frustrating that after dying repeatedly near the end of one difficult mission and respawning back to the beginning and having to do everything again, I took thegame CD and smashed it with a weight and snapped it in half; that was the most fun I got from the entire game."
2,"Most of Jak II is great fun, but...","...there's a reason I don't buy racing games. I don't like them. They aren't fun to me. Had I known that I would be forced to play race games in order to progress through Jak II I would have never had purchased it. And at this point I can't win the races so I can't go any further in the game. Honestly, I'm sorely disappointed.Lesson learned: Rent before you buy, even if the first game of the series was the most fun game you ever played."
4,Fun!,I like this game because it was more edgier (Jak and Daxter was a bit too rated E for me) and I liked the guns. I was excited when I first heard about it and even more excited when I got it for Christmas. Though some missions frustrate me they're all relatively easy (after you die a few times). The downside would probably be because it ended so shortly. But there's plenty of drama and decieving. Gatta love it
4,one of the years best games,"I am positive this is one of the years best games. It has a lot of action and an interesting story. The only problem is that the missions are pretty hard. You have to try over and over about 4-5 times to complete them. I myself cussed and threw my controler, but a minute later I was on to the next mission. It's wierd how you can hate it one minute, but then love it the next. There is not that much cussing in the game either. there are like three bad words in the whole hour and a half i played it. The worst ones are crap and piss off. over all, this game is a keeper(if you have a good temper)."
5,"At the top of my list; next to SOCOM, MA:Gits & R&C","It's classic, shoot 'em up, zany Jak action. Tis game is insanely funny and zany. The right amount of fighting with a pinch of Fun and Funny characters, there is no game more fun than MA:GitS or SOCOm, but this comes in a very very close, photo finsh 2nd place, thatere is no game comparible to Jak, except for MA:GitS, Socom & Tak and the power of JuJu.Buy this game along with the 3 I mentioned to get your best gaming experiences ever!JakII is worth every penny. Infact I would stake all of my possessions on it..."
2,not as good as rachet and clank going commando.,"what is this lame garbage. yes i will admit this is an ok game but theres so many flaws. for instance what the heck is up with the difficulty level its crazy. this game is soooo hard, and its not just hard. rachet and clank going commando is hard this is just plain insane. youre in a portal surrounded by huge robots and have to kill bunches of them than highjek a car this games difficulty level is out of control. the characthers suck the music is bad and so much veichletraviling i would like to be on the ground once in a while. not only that but whaT the heck is going on they have swearing in the cut scenes and daxter the little fuzzball that he is is getting behind the triger of a machine gun. forget about this crap and go get rachet and clank gc instead. its a game thats hard but not just plain unreasonably insane hard like this hunk of junk."
3,"Good game, but will leave you frustrated","If you've played the first Jak game, forget it. That game was cutzie, short, and easy. Jak II, however, is going to have you pulling you hair out!The most obvious changes are that Jak talks, and he has a bad attitude. If someone had preformed experiments on me for two years, I'd probubly be a little cheesed off as well.The game is also MUCH darker, being set in a HUGE city that is under seige and ruled by a totalitarian dictator.My number one bit of advice: Get the strategy guide! This game is one of the hardest I have ever played. If you finish one of the missions only having died three or four times, you're doing good. The game can be a beat down, and I don't recomend playing it more than for an hour or so at a time... you'll probubly end up throwing your PS2 out the window.In breif, the graphics, sound, game-controls, and story line are great. However, the size of the city, and the thoughness of the levels and missions can leave you extreemly frustrated."
1,Not what I requested,"I ordered the aforementioned CD, however, I did not receive it. A different CD was sent to me instead. I did not feel like going through the trouble of sending it back, so I kept what was sent. What I received is horrible. I will not use this supplier ever again."
1,Boring video; no ghost activity,"Don't buy this video; I bought it for my son. It is incredibly boring and has no ghost activity. It actually is just an episode of ""the unexplained"" a series that came on a few years back. They never actually discusses any hauntings or ghost activity. As I stated, it is one of the most uninteresting, boring videos I have ever bought. Don't waste your money."
5,Excellent,I decided to try one of these for storing photobooks and am very pleased. Like the previous review has stated the drawers come with handles and covers which help keep dust out which is perfect for my books. The wheels are a snap(literally) to install and no tools are needed for assembly. The transparent drawers are also a plus as they reveal the contents of each drawer for faster access. I was a little skeptical of the price but am now relieved to say it was worth my 30 dollars and would gladly order more in the future.
3,Doesn't fit on holster,Doesn't fit on holster. At least on the holster I bougth at the same time from the same company.
2,way too unfocused,"I was disappointed because I had high hopes and this was a letdown...Not on par with the ""Eisenhorn"" series, not even close. The characters a flat and undeveloped, the story lines (the whole book actually story) are disjointed and poorly communicated. The action chaotic, chopped short and lacks any kind of continuity. Events pop-up for no reason other than to advance the a single chapter, without regards for developing a better story. I realize that it's about aerial combat but that is no excuse of the huge gaps left the story. Heck, even the aerial battles are so choppy and short they are almost distracting. And the end came across as a copout. I don't recommend against buying/reading it (it's not bad brain candy) but it fall so sort of the potential that I was expecting it was a real letdown."
3,This Book it Titled Wrong,"This book has nothing to do with the Gaunts Ghosts series, it has a character from that series, but not advising to purchase as part of it."
1,I'm embarrassed for having purchased this for my grandchild,"Though the Sleeper series seem to have a wonderful following, this book missed the mark. I was shocked to be confronted by my outraged son-in-law. In many places in the middle and toware the end, you can find obviously obnoxious depictions of the female characters. <i>To be strong of will is to be willfully wrong?</i> Sorry, we believe otherwise. Go for the gold, folks: Harry Potter doesn't let us done. We enjoyed another tale entitled the Amazon Story Bones - a unique tale as told through the eyes of a young Amazon."
2,All style no substance,"Her sentences may be well written, granted, but it doesn't add up. An ode to ""gee how can I describe myself as beautiful, and get paid for it."" Really she's just a glorified VHI House of Fashion type of person, or at least comes off this way in the memoir. I'd much rather read a book by a writer who cares about the world, and not herself"
5,An honest account of a very dishonest relationship....,"I felt that I knew Dani quite well after reading her book, though I agree that she did not get into her relationship with ""Jess"" or the relationship between ""Jess"" and ""Lenny"" as deeply as I would have expected. Seems to me that a sleazeball like Lenny would have sex with anyone on two legs...so his own stepdaughter would be fair game. Dani had to know ""more"" about their relationship than she shared in her book. As far as Lenny goes, how is he any different than 90% of the AAWM's (Arrogant $*#(@() With Money) that walk the streets of NYC or any other major city these days?!? Glad to know she woke up and got out before she killed herself over sagging skin and wrinkles!"
5,Fantastic,"Fantastic espresso beans! I usually drink Illy, but thought I would give this a 'shot'... and I was not disappointed! This has a slightly smokier flavor than the Illy roasts, produces a NICE crema, and is ultra smooth.In short, give this a try. Highly recommended for my fellow coffee heads out there..."
4,Refreshing,"Great fusion of eastern melody with western beats. Definitely an album to have if you are a fan of Talvin Singh, Medival Punditz and others in the same genre. Liberation is also best KK album to date."
5,The most balanced book on controversies in Genesis,"This book is the best book to get all the major perspectives on the most controversial questions in Genesis. Do not expect to come away with one view touted over the rest. Each of the 12 questions comes with two authors arguing both views effectively. Though it is not affiliated with it, the book comes off similar to the 4 views books if you are familiar with those. You will want to have a basic knowledge of the debated questions, particularly the scientific ones. Probably not an introduction, but more like a book given to stretch ones existing beliefs on creationism and other various questions in Genesis."
1,Didn't fit my headset,"This didn't fit my headset, the plastic earpeices make it harder to hear, very much disappointed. The screw piece was to small and the earpieces would fall out. not the same as original pieces"
5,Excellante,My manager purchased us a wireless blue tooth for work. We schedule Imaging and Cardiology at a BJC Hospital. I like my desk area to stay clean and after a while the ear tips turn yellow from age and cleaning. This was a very good value. I kept the clear ones and my co worker took the black ones. I will purchase them again if needed.
1,"Trash, expensive trash, DO NOT BUY - ZERO STARS",ZERO STARS - DO NOT BUY. Broke in 5 months. Clicking sounds followed by complete malfunction.
1,2 Drives - 2 Failures - 4 Months - Lesson Learned,"We used two of these drives a primary project storage for our production group. Both drives failed and customer support was well, poor at best. The only positive I can say is that we are glad we have a double redundant backup of all our files. It has saved us twice now."
3,Not bad,"Gerr starts this book with the calculation of a ""scantling number."" This number is essentially based off the length, width and height of the vessel. He then applies this number to several charts thoughout the book to give ""rule of thumb"" values on the proper dimensions of the scantlings (hull plating, stiffeners, beams, etc.) for the vessel in question. Overall this book should be useful to the home boat builder. The math in the book is simple and the values obtained from the book seem reasonable for most boats. The books main weakness is that it glosses over the engineering aspects (calculating stresses, etc.)."
2,Why rule of thumb in computer era?,"As a desginer, I can not understand the meaning of this book.1.Take any scantling rule of classification societies and compare. Scantlings section of rulebook is much more thin, but provides more optoins and engineering basics for calculations of strength.2.What is the meaning of Gerr's own scantling rule, if You have to proceed design approval from classification society? You better use the rulebook of this society, aren't You?3.The book use several assumptions that I mind. For example, the recommendation to add some per cent of hull thickness for every knot over 10 knots is not reasonabe. The designer should deal with speed/length ratio to determine planning/non planning bottom loads.4.The book does not give any idea of hull loads. Overview of loads is desired as soon as he write about strength, something like provided in L.Larsson R.Eliasson ""Principles of Yacht Design"".But I really like other Gerr's books, indeed!Best regards,A.Nazarov, Naval Architect, Ph.D."
3,Unfortunately does not apply on small boats!!,"Im building a 4,20 (15feet)International class sailboat using epoxies and 4mm plywood using Van de stadt plans. And because I wanted to check it I order this book.Im very disappointed ! The calculations does not work in small boats Are Completely Wrong!Author mentioning that the calculations can be used from 3 meters boats to 37 meter boats .But when I tried the results was a 6 times thicker boat !Do not hesitate to contact me if you thing Im wrong"
3,But my vinyl has _seven_ tracks,"That's right, seven tracks on my vinyl.As follows:The Boudoir Stomp,It Hurts Me Too,Edwards Thrump Up,Blow With Ry,Interlude a la El Hopo,* The Loveliest Night of he Year *,Highland Fling.The lost track is indicated by * *.For the price difference and the missing track i think i will give the CD a pass for now."
1,Poorly Planned,I would not recommend this video to anyone. The segments are not in the same sequence as the sleeve which makes it frustrating to figure out which workout is which. I wish I would have read the reviews before purchasing.
5,"For a good stretch for seniors, newbies, etc.","The other reviews commenting on the poor DVD organization are right on. However, I very much like the Rod Stryker episodes for AM and PM. I'm a somewhat overweight senior who would rather do an easy-going half hour daily of yoga, than try to become a yoga sweat jock at my age. So I look for DVD routines that gently challenge but don't break my knees--or a sweat for that matter. I should take a look at the Deason segments as well. The negative reviews here look like they're from folks who are looking for a much more challenging workout. One person said they work out for an hour in the AM and two to three hours in the PM???? When do they get time to work, shop, cook, recreate? I also recommend any Larry Payne for older folks, and also any of the Yoga Away DVD's."
4,Dirty Sweet EP,"An outstanding EP, that will most certainly blow you away. Within the first minute of listening I was hooked. Resembling early Beatles and the rolling stones, it's hard to say this band isn't going to be huge. They certainly have got 2003 covered, and I'm eagerly awaiting the album. I'd advise this EP to any rock 'n' roll fan gagging to get their paws on a band that really put the rock back in rock 'n' roll."
4,"Great shoes, but not easy to clean","I loved these shoes for my daughter. We had the pink pair and they went with all her outfits. They stayed on really well and fit her for about 3 months. The only problem I found with these shoes was that they are not colorfast. When I wet one to try to remove some dirt, the color wiped off, leaving a faded spot on the leather. All in all a great shoe- just keep them dry."
2,6 pack beanie socks,Very cute and the price was right. But they are just way too small for the items they are suppose to carry and protect.
3,A little small for iTouch,"I was surprised how small these covers were. Even after stretching they don't quite cover the iTouch. If they were 1"" longer they'd be perfect"
1,miniature socks,the socks are TINY. I was expecting a full size sock when i ordered (enough to cover an ipod classic) but instead they ended up about half of the size. They only cover half of the classic.
5,Lost 30 lbs so far with this DVD,I've lost 30 lbs so far with this DVD and I've had a ball doing it! Easy to learn and fun to do!
3,Dance off the inches - Ballroom,"Though I have taken ball room classes before, this video just does not really do it for me.I will have to give it some more time I guess. I think the lesson are ok. But I need more motivation.But I have only attempted it a few times maybe it will grab my attention later.I will keep at it.I do like the fact that it breaks it down for comprehension but I need more motivation and a little bit more excitement from the instructor."
4,Fun video!,"This video was great for a change of pace. I usually stick to my Jillian Micheals, Jackie Warner and Bob Harper workouts. While this is not a tough workout it is great to shake things up a bit. I was sweating but it is definitely low impact. I thought it was a lot of fun!"
3,Not advanced enough if dancing is a regular workout,"I ordered this DVD because it sounded like it was for a more advanced exerciser who does many dance workouts, but this is geared for a beginner. It is not at a quick enough pace, with too many explanations that slow your momentum so I couldn't keep my my heart rate up. I did it once and gave it away."
1,Never Received,I tried to contact the seller twice with no luck. I waited and waited and the book never came. And now I'm screwed.
1,LBJ meets the romance novel,If you are interested in political biography skipTexas in the Morning. This book reads like a baddime-store romance.I was hoping that Madeleine Brown would have someinsight into the character of LBJ. She doesn't.Don't read this book unless you are interested inwhat LBJ was like in bed.
4,great read,Spinner Publishing has done it again. They have pout together another timeless book that captures the very esence of New Bedford Massachusettes as the formner center of the whaling world. Anyone who like history or is interested in the people and areas of oldtime Mass must read this book
1,An incredibly bad experience.,"This flick is without a doubt one of the worst slasher films of all time. Its hard to believe it took 3 people to direct this mess. The high school students are played by 30-something actors, the music is annoying, and the killer is one of the most unscary I have ever seen, the jester mask is stupid looking! Do yourself a favor, just avoid it."
1,Someone should have slaughtered the directors!,"Don't waste your money. 80 bucks will buy you 3 or 4 good slasher flicks unlike this lousy rip-off of Pranks. Terrible acting, poor special effects and a totally lacklusture ending make this a movie well worth avoiding. I was given an original 1986 copy, but if I'd bought it I would feel totally ripped off. Watch Friday 13th instead."
3,finally on DVD,"Did Marty Rantzen all his life in high school(since they never did show his whole high school years in the movie), been picked on every April Fool's Day, and they knew it was his birthday? How is it that when he told Carol in the girls locker room that April Fools Day is his birthday, and she was shocked to find that out? I think he's been picked on all his life at Doddsville High before his senior year when he got burned, but I don't think anyone knew it was his birthday at all. Or maybe they did find out and pretended like they never knew it was his birthday? Well they got what they deserved for messing with him. Finally Slaughter High hits DVD but what is up with the corny looking guy on the cover?"
2,Lame slasher stuff!!!,"People are invited to a mysterious high school reunion, only to be picked off one by one. A done-to-death slasher that offers nothing original. View at own risk!!!"
5,Give Us More..........,"Vanhal lived in the days of Mozart, Haydn, Ditterdorf, Boccherini, Stamitz, Hummel, Kraus, and etc. On occasion, he played String Quartets with Haydn, Mozart and Dittersdorf. These SQ's are early works of Vanhal and have just 3 movements, but they are well crafted and highly energetic. They are excellent and are in the same category as Dittersdorf's SQs. Vanhal was a true pioneer of the SQ as was Dittersdorf, Mozart and Haydn. I just wish there was a complete set of his SQs recorded."
4,Sarah Brightman-Diva: The Video Collection,"I found it very interesting to see Sarah's development as a singer/performer over the years. I did find one of the videos wierd (people in boxes??), but that is fine. Much imagination and creativity went into this collection. (I saw her in the ""Harem"" concert a few years ago and I hope to see her again) She is now one of my favorite singers! I highly recommend this video."
3,Disappointed,"This collection of 14 of the best Superman stories from his many comic appearances in the 70's was a little diappointing. After reading and thoroughly enjoying the Superman in the Sixties Collection, I was looking forward with great anticipation to picking up and reading this follow up. Unfortunately, these stories (with a few exceptions) seemed bland and were not as enjoyable as other Superman stories I have read. If you are a Superman fan this collection is good read and will be enjoyed, but if you are a casual reader spend your money and time on the Superman in the Sixties Collection and pass on this one."
5,Great review,"Great book! Lots of beautiful artwork and great stories that I haven't seen since I was a kid. The only bad thing is that ""Superman 2001"" from Superman #300 was not reprinted since the year 2001 is upon us. But all in all, still a great paperback!"
4,Waifs and Strays,"""This is one of the writers (Charles De Lint) who wrote in the Borderland Series, so I thought I would round up his books too. I was glad I did as I enjoyed his other stories as well. A good writer who can you Young Adult as well as Adult Fiction."""
5,Well done from a medical point of view,"This book is unique in that it comes from a medical/physiological point of view. It is the first book in over 30 years that looks at the complexity of the human body as it pertains to evolution. In the early 70's a book entitled The Body has a Head was published. It was virtually unreadable. Dr. Simmons book is eminently readable and very interesting. Furthermore, Darwin had several doubts about his own theories and Dr. Simmons points out these areas of weakness. If you want to learn something about the arguments surrounding evolution and don't want to have to read a scientific tome, this is the book for you."
1,A complete waste of time and money. No value.,"First the author needs to learn how to write. Second to know the historical facts, if interested to establish any credibility. The whole book is nothing but stories at a 6 year old level."
4,NCAA DVD,"DVD of the 1993 NCAA championship game. No other items included like interviews, history, etc. Simply a replay of the game."
5,Laughed Out Loud,"Reading the new edition of Virgins, the hilarious book by Caryl Rivers, about the a group of Catholic girls in the 1950s and their various adventures [and misadventures] at an all-girls Catholic High School, I'm reminded of the old rye bread commercial that showed an adorable little Asian boy salivating over a rye bread sandwich. ""You don't have to be Jewish to love Levy's real Jewish Rye,"" went the tagline.Well, you don't have to be Catholic to adore ""Virgins."" In truth, I am neither, but couldn't stop laughing out loud at the hi-jinks of these engaging young women struggling against their narrow-minded elders. Indeed, this book could not be more timely, what with the Vatican's recent reprimand of the ""radical feminist"" nuns for challenging its views on male-only priests and homosexuality, and for focusing too much on poverty and economic injustice.Sophie KatzBrookline, MA"
4,Metro Vacuum MB3CD Airforce Master Blaster 8-HP,"Powerful blower, this product works as advertised. The only issue I have, is I wish the hose was more flexible"
3,"Adequate, not great","I expected more power after watching the sales video. It does dry the car but takes a lot longer than I anticipated. The mjor draw back is the hose, it's not easy to manage while drying the car. I would recommend it but plan about 20 mins to dry a car."
5,How hard can it be?,"The famous last words of many, including Jeremy Clarkson have gotten them in trouble.This season includes some of the best specials, the USA Special where they practice their drive-by shooting technique at cut outs of the Stig while riding in supercars and then the Middle East special where they go in search of the new Stig.Then there's the usual craziness, awesome cars, and celebrities acting silly in a cheap car. Don't miss this great season."
3,The Climb from Dark Places,"Resilience is a complex concept. The authors definition is a good beginning --having inner strength to meet challenges. My question is what gives some the inner fortitude to climb out of dark places while others stay there frozen and frightened?Salvadore Maddi was a true pioneer researching resilience 20 years ago. It was not front and center in the minds of corporate leaders until perhaps after 9-11 shook us to our roots. It seems that the hardiness skills Maddi teaches are even more necessary as life takes us on a faster and steeper ride each year.I agree that learning better ways to resolve conflicts and more effective problem solving skills are vital. I was also hoping for newer ideas and reasons why so many learn the skills and yet revert back to old patterns that do not show hardiness and resilience. This book helps and also opens the dialogue for more research.Sylvia Lafair PhD, author ""Don't Bring It to work: Breaking the Family Patterns that Limit Success"""
4,Good value,"Sleek styling, and clear, white light. Adjustable to a degree, but the best feature is the heavy base."
1,Did not do the justice to subject and boring repetitive write up,"I am huge believer of auto suggestion and its proven impact on mind. So far, this is the most poorly written book I have ever read about the subject. Was a huge disappointmnet.1) Didnt cover the subject appropriately enough2) what ever was covered , is so repetitive that you get tired."
1,What are the films in this set?,There is no list of the actual 9 films that are in this DVD set. They list all of the extras but not the films. Ridiculous.
4,CablesToGo-Excellent Product as usual,Arrived packaged professionally-cable was wired professionally.Using for video camera and DVR and wanted to place the camera in a different location.This products works as advertised.
3,Bad things happen to bad people,"Having enjoyed reading the Redwall series of books by the same author, I started this book with high expectations. While the seven stories all have interesting and unexpected twists and an odd sense of humor, I ultimately found the book unsatisfying. The Redwall books are stories about good triumphing over evil. In Seven Strange and Ghostly Tales, the best you could say about the stories is that bad things happen to bad people. The characters are either bad people, or good people who are victimized by the bad people. For this reason, I found it hard to relate to any of the characters. And unlike Jacques' other books, there are no heroic figures fighting on the side of good. If this book is meant to help instill positive values in younger readers, it would be by frightening them with supernatural consequences of being bad, rather than providing positive role models."
5,The foundational principles of government,This is an extremely good primer on the Biblical foundations of government. I would recommend it for non Christian as well as Christian to understand how reality works properly and in good order.
5,Great Reading,"I have seen the movie Tammy several times, because I've got the VHS & DVD. It was great reading the book, because there is so much more.After reding it I bought the book ""Tammy tell me true"" and reading it."
5,Safari goes on a world tour....,I have been giving Safari as a Birthday Gift to my son in law for the last 10 years who travels all over the world for the business and this perfume is appreciated everywhere....
5,easy to use,"had trouble keeping a pulse with a chest strap HRM, the PowerGlove is so easy to use and provides a constant heart rate"
2,Heat damaged product,"I received my fragrance and was at first surprised with how the capping worked. The large top came off and another plastic cover was fixed closely to the bottle. This plasic cover showed sings of a melted substance. This plastic cover was actually the base of the cap. The melted substance might have been glue, but it might have been fragrance that leaked under pressure. The paint job on the outside of the bottle appears sharp at a distance and was close to a nice job, but had a few extra paint splotches.I'm a fan of this fragrance (from a sampler I received once). The fragrance smells great, but I'd like to compare it to an in-store version.I'm tending to believe I received an authentic product that was cheap becaues it was heat damaged, but I could be convinced otherwise."
2,I did not care for it.,I did not care for this product. I did not like the way it smelled on me. I would not buy it again.
3,A gift,The product didn't have as strong of an aroma as it does when I test it in the department stores.
1,Totally Disappointed..,"Hi,I am not statisfied with the product that i recieve.I think they have mix something because this is not original.this one is not smelling like the original one.I am totally disappointed shopping with Amazon.I was doing shopping with Amazon from last two years but this time.."
5,Love this scent,"This scent is nice on the nose. Not too strong that it is overpowering, and does last longer than someothers. Always gets compliments that he smells good, from the ladies. He likes it also, thats what counts. I buy it for him all the time."
1,Smells like lemon + glycerine,"Really, this is what this cologne smells like. I wonder why is this so hyped up? I would suggest anyone to test it a couple of times, and then decide if this is for them."
2,Good train set -- lousy mountain,"Well, I should have read all the other reviews before buying this one. Now it's off to Toys R Us to try to explain to the customer service employee that no amount of fresh batteries will make this thing explode. I'll try Ray O Vac like someone else suggested. Also, I have a suspicion that the set I have had already been returned -- it didn't come with any instruction book, just a single sheet on how to set up the tracks and insert the batteries. I'm not even sure what this exploding mountain is supposed to do."
1,A Big Let Down,"My two sons were so excited to get this set. Unfortunately, as seems to be typical, the mountain did not detonate - despite changing the batteries several times. We then went to the store and got a new set - and once again the mountain does not work. We are shocked and disappointed by the poor quality of this set and hope that Toys R Us plans a way to right this wrong."
1,Upset parent,"This train set was a gift for my 3 year old. The rock quarry does not work. I am very upset. I refuse to buy special batteries that probably in time will fail also. One sheet of instructions is not enough. There isn't a customer service phone number in the box either. I will take this entire set back to Toys R Us and request a refund. I will then buy my son a different set, by a different vendor. This is very dissapointing. Toys r Us should take the set down that is on display in the store, and not sell this type of toy anymore. Imaginarium is making Toys r Us look bad as a retailer. The children go into the store and play with the display and when we as parents buy it for them, it doesn't work. This is just SAD."
5,Works Like it Should,This worked great. I only had to use it one time but I had not problems from it good price too.
1,"""Great Art""","Damien Hirst is one of if not the greatest con-artists of this generation.Avoid his ponzi scheme ""art"" like the plague."
1,I Don't Get IT and You Shouldn't Either,"I can understand a producer and engineer wanting to try to come up with a distinct sound and it has been done succesfully before on releases like Buddy Guy's Sweet Tea, but all they manage to do here is stink. I know this statement is going to outrage the bands fans but sometimes artists need to be told the truth. Hopefully they have learned their lesson with their experimentel garage band garbage sound and can move on with their careers without too much damage done. I pulled this out of the changer before it damaged a perfectly good pair of studio reference monitors. I'm wondering if they used a transitor radio on playback when they mixed it."
2,Not their best by far.,"Mato Nanji is a great guitarist - and that alone keeps this CD afloat most of the time. The song writing is mundane andpredictable - the Hendrix influence stops with the guitar playing. The production is, in a word, horrible - I kept adjusting my stereo trying to make it sound good. Listen to Things We Do or Live At Pacyderm Studios if you want to hear this band at their best."
5,"A man who has been abducted many times, tells of them fully.","He tells, in this(His second of three books) of being abducted by the aliens many many times, and that, contrary to many crazies, that they arent here for any spiritual crap. He wards those who yell HOAX! extremely well, presenting the evidence. Thank you for reading."
4,wonderful for a gift,"The bottle is very pretty, excellent gift for a teenage girl. Gave it to my daughter, she loved it! It smells nice, however, does not last as long as I thought it would, but she is happy.Great deal for the price."
5,All time favorite!,"Lolita Lempicka is without a doubt my all time favorite perfume. It has a definite licorice note to it, but it's wrapped in this yummy goodness that just sort of makes you happy to be alive. I've loved it since junior high school, and I'm in my mid-30s now."
3,fragrance collector,"I purchased this because I absoslutely love woody orientals and different, intriqueing scents.. This one didnt match me well. It has an almost acrid, mossy sort of quality to it that I didnt like. I like more warm woody fragrances I suppose. This is a very different scent - so if you typically stick to one family of fragrances, this may not be for you.. But if you like decidedly unique fragrances that smell like nothing else you've ever worn - give this a shot. It's deffinitely interesting - although, not good for me."
4,He loves it. I don't.,"I don't know what to think of this perfume. My guy likes it a lot. He offered to buy it from me when I mentioned returning it. He says he would give it to his niece as a gift. He describes it as ""it's not one of those I-wana-bang-you-NOW scents but its so good""I neither like nor hate it. It reminds me of the dentist office. I'm tempted to keep and wear it just because he does like it. I'll stick to my Victoria's secret, love spell.I do not regret trying it. I would recommend trying it with likely giving it away in mind for just in case you're one of the lucky ladies that can love this scent."
5,"Atilano, MBA",It's a good book for the basic understanding of organization design. It's easy to read and easy to follow the concepts and theories. As a Professor I strongly recommend it.
1,Broke on the first day,"Oversized doesn't mean extra capacity. I'm a big guy (~300 lbs)and I used this chair in a bling while hunting black bear. Luckily, I was successful on the first day because the chair was a pile of broken plastic and bent metal by the time I packed out."
4,Tecmo Classic Arcade,"If you grew up on coin-op games, you'll love this compilation.The classic football game Tecmo Bowl is included."
2,Under-par Performance,This Junior does not spray the lengths that are indicated on the box. The maker immediately sent a replacement head but that still did not work. Great and immediate response from the maker.
5,Fantastic foreshadowing of Dubya's America,This is not a typical science fiction book--in fact I first came across this book in an undergraduate political science course. The book is not really college level reading but the underlying themes definitely are. This book looks at the balance between freedom and security. It will definitely make you think.
1,Don't waste your money,"There were only two reviews for this book (original version) and even one of those being a 3 star it sounded worth reading. It was being updated and I waited to get the second. Both the time I waited and my money were wasted. The 3 star review was generous. The premise is sound but it is poorly written with little character development. Info from a list shows the second review,a 5 star, was written by the co-owner of this press and Ruskin's romantic and business partner. If you're a lesbian looking for mindless entertainment - a quick read with the depth of a shallow pool - this is it. If you want a good book, look elsewhere.Don't waste your money."
2,Eh....,"Story was okay I guess. It was very rushed, chars did not get developed much. It really didn't seem like much happened. At 274 pages (large pages with large print) it went super quick. I've read a lot of recent stuff by MJD and this doesn't hold up to it. Just a poor romance novel really."
2,"Hello, vapid!","I enjoy Davidson's breathless, chick-lit vampire books. Hello, Gorgeous is fluffier, more whipped, and devoid of almost all plot.We're told by her friends that the heroine is the smartest thing ever in the history of her sorority, but we don't see it. She has no curiousity, and little love of anything outside her small circle.The plot was mildly interesting, but the cartoon-like dialogue wasn't worth the trip. I'm going back to the ""Undead and..."" books."
3,Almost worth the price,"I really enjoyed this book. Was it worth the price tag - no. If the book had sold for 6.99 I would be giving it a higher score. The characters are funny, but you feel like you're missing something. Like drinking fuzzy water - where is the taste/flavor. Sure it was fun to drink but afterwards you're really thirsty. I liked the Boss and the best friend, they almost overshadowed the heroine. The hero (I can't even remember his name,just that he was tall, dark haired, wealthy and some sort of royalty) was underdeveloped. The heroine, came off as another whiny, white girl. After a while you start to say how difficult could your life really be: you have super powers, a great body, and you own your own business. Just shut up and go do the work. Stacy (the friend) finally shuts her up when she reminds her nothing in life is free. Stacy needs her own book (and a trip to AA)."
3,Ecco-brand disappointment,"I was in love with the Ecco Seawalker for 3 years. I will probably buy the Seawalker again, even for 3-times as much as I bought my discounted Neobasic Oxfords ($50).This shoe may look like an urban shoe, but the tread makes my feet feel like they are walking on painful little ridges. The tread is squishy, but still not comfortable.I would consider the Neobasic more of a hiking shoe than an oxford. For this reason, I am satisfied that the shoe is well-constructed."
2,An O.K. product,"It is a little too thin for my taste, but most covers seem to be. It easily gets snagged on rings and jewelry so now I have to take my jewelry off before changing him. It is pretty thin so it doesn't absorb or protect against any wetness. I use a small pad to help protect it. It is basically for design now and to match my son's bedding."
1,Too small,"We have an ""Especially for Baby"" contour changing pad, and this cover is too small for it. I have to force it on, which causes the pad to bow and it squishes the corners of the pad."
1,Hated it!,"It's too small for standard contoured changing pad! Plus, it shrinks in the wash! It is also very poor construction, the stiching around the elastic that secures it was coming loose when I opened the package! Needless to say, we returned it!"
1,Not the best quality,"I am disappointed with the quality if this item. I have two and they both looked old, faded and worn after the first wash. Not happy."
1,Don't waste your money!,"I am very unhappy with these changing pad covers, and unfortunately I have both a green and a white one. Like other reviewers, I have found that they shrink like mad (and I too know the proper way to do laundry), even after drying on low and washing in cold water. They look like 50 year old towels and are covered with pulls now, too."
4,We like it,"While this cover is a bit rough, my baby doesn't spend more than 2 minutes at a time on it, so that doesn't bother me. I've used it for several months now and it's held up well through weekly washings. I actually have 2 and rotate them out. I have the Sage Green and the color has stayed true, I wash them in warm water with Free & Cleer detergent and am happy with the way they've held up after reading some negative reviews. I found some burp clothes that coordinate and I leave them on top of the changing pad cover soif it gets dirty, I just throw a new burp cloth on top instead of changing the whole thing."
5,Not your ordinary bat book!,"We (five year old son and I) really enjoy reading this interesting book. The story is clever and the pictures are very detailed...so much so that we see different things on each page every time we read the story. I also like the fact that this book takes potentially ""creepy"" animals and makes them really likeable and fun."
4,On the Mellow Tip...,"Ok. Regardless of what some people may say, I like this album. I picked it up on Tuesday morning, put it in my cd player, and chilled out with it. It is definitely one of their more mellow efforts. Some people seem to only like their fast paced songs, but I like when a band can do both, and do both WELL. That is the key.I find it intersting that, for a change, a single on the radio is one of the 3 best songs on the album. ""Creatures (For A While)"" has a great beat, thought provoking lyrics (if you're willing to listen for them) and is very satisfying. I also really liked ""Seems Uncertain"" and ""Same Mistake Twice"", which went back to a very ""Flowing"" type of beat. Very cool.The DVD features on the discs are really nothing special, but the cd is definitely worth adding to your collection. Hard core 311 fans may be disappointed, but only if they rely soley on the harder-edged songs. Have an open mind, and you'll enjoy it. The boys have grown up."
5,More 311 magic,"Once again 311 breaks out with an unbelievable album. Continuing on with 311 style, this release has elements of rock, funk and reggae, all mixed into a perfect blend. Check out the tracks ""Don't Dwell"" and ""Other Side Of Things."""
3,Evolved how much?,"Here's how I rate:5: Masterpiece.4: Must have for a collection.3: Worth the buy.2: Its listenable.1: Complete waste of time and money.First off, I love 311. I use to like some of 311's music, but couldn't get into it because it all sounded the same. Well, they do, but because its 311. I eventually fell in love with them when I started to actually listen to 311.This album though, didn't do much for me at first and it still doesn't. The songwriting is what one would expect from 311, bouncy and hooky, but its just too much of the same for me. They don't seem to be having as much fun. The lyrics don't move me as much as they use to. Maybe I am outgrowing them, but I don't think so because I still love their other stuff.Overall, this album is better than From Chaos. Some songs on here are really good. The rest is just 311 playing 311 music."
3,Evolved?,"The CD offers great beats, smart lyrics and the wide ranging style that 311 ALWAYS provide. The track that stands out the most for me is 'Same Mistake Twice' for two reasons. 1) It sounds alot like flowing and 2) It's the best track on the CD but runs in close competition with 'Sometimes Jacks Rule the Realm'. All-in-all a good album, 311 will be here a while!- Christopher"
5,Different,"Being a very dedicated 311 fan, I love this album. However, this album very different from previos releases from 311. There are few heavy guitar riffs, little slap bass(besides 'dont dwell'), and much less hiphop influence. Instead there are more sentimental lyrics, and more melodic riffs. Overall, the album has a certain 311 vibe to it, but they truly have evolved on this release."
4,A Step In The Right Direction,"The first time I listened to this CD was the 22nd of July.I listened to it 4 times that day. I made myself stop listening to it on a crappy little radio and then took myself on an hour long spin in my car to hear it in pure audio ecstacy.This album is a step in the right direction for 311 who had less than hopeful results with their last two discs...The songs are good, lyrics reminscent of what I liked on Transistor and previous endeavours, as well as a mix with some new aspects in great triumphs over near-failed attempts that I've been with them through.I think 311's making leaps and bounds, even if they do have, what was it, 1 album left with their current label?Well, good deal 311, I'll see you when you get to New Orleans, I've got my ticket in hand.pic0"
1,Disappointed!,"After finishing this book I said outloud, ""What a stupid book!"" If indeed the author had these experiences, he could have elaborated so much more and changed the dialogue a bit. The dialogue is one of a ""hey, dude...like da."" He uses so many cliches and is extremely unoriginal. The only good parts were the exerpts he included from an enlightenment handbook...some good meditaion techniques. The rest of the book was ...."
2,Please help! Does this work with vista?,"We had problems loading this on our previous computer, but had a new cd sent to us and it worked. Now we have a new pc with vista and we cannot get this to work. My sons are very disappointed! We even just had a new disc sent out, but it does not work. After we load the game, it asks us to insert the orignal disc. We hit retry, etc. It just does not work. Any advice would be greatly appreciated! Just comment....Thanks!"
1,Want SecuROM DRM? Buy this game...,Great game. My son and I have had fun with it. While investigating reasons behind my computer's tendency to reboot and/or freeze without warning... behold! Lego games come with SecuROM DRM. Thanks for screwing up my computer LucasArts.
5,lego star wars is gonna be awesome!,This game to me looks like a whole lot of fun and I can't wait to fight out Star Wars Episode III Revenge of the Sith!
1,Legos: Star Wars..,There is a problem with the software instalation and I would definitely not recommend buying this software. Tried calling Eidos support line but only was only able to get the company directory. I am very angry about the time and effort spent trying to install this software on Xmas.
1,Great game.... if you can get it to work,"I bought this game for my son because he loved playing the demo in the store so much. Unfortunately, just like many many other reviewers, this game will not work on my computer. This is particularly frustrating because this computer is not even a month old. There is no way I'm going to drop another $155 to upgrade a new computer just to play this game no matter how cute it is. Be VERY VERY careful... do NOT waste $30 on this game unless you are absolutely positive that your computer has the right kind of video card."
4,A cool game,"I love this game. I think that the graphics were great. I love the storyline. And the sound is amazing. I have almost beat everything and almost everything is perfect. However, it did freeze up a few times. The characters were cool. Though when I played 2 player I always got mixed up with the controls.Don't be fooled, the game may look easy at first, but there are some tough levels, including the vehicle levels. Overall, I think this is a good game and highly recommend it."
1,Warning -- Will NOT Run on the average guy's computer!,"Okay, first I need to say that I'm a computer geek. I know my machines and how to take care of them. I'm not an avid PC gamer though, so my PC is very good, but does not have the latest $599.95 video card on the market. My son desperately wanted this game and, being overconfident in my own geekiness, I bought it without reading the specs on the back of the package. You need a VERY specific video card in your machine or this will not install. Since I'm not about to rush out and drop a super-charged vid card to play a $30 game, this purchase was a total waste of time. **Parents, this game will NOT work on your computer, even if you bought it this year, unless, of course, you have purchased the top of the line gamer's machine. Spare your kids the heartache, and buy it for the Gameboy instead."
2,lego star wars The video game.,"We bought the game for our son and the only problem is on our computer every time my daughter goes on a certain sight, like Skype, it shuts the whole game down and you have to redo the whole process over again. Take the game out and start like you just got the game. I am no computer junkie but I personally don't think that should happen. Maybe on high tec. computers it doesn't but it said it would work on a PC. Thanks"
3,Good for new pcs,My dad and i got this game and i was really excited. I tried it out at home but found out that we had to old of a pc(2002). Please look at the requirements first. I was veeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrrry disappointed! To see a good review go to www.gamefaqs.com/portable/gbadvance/review/R86514.html
5,Can't wait for next update!,"Though this book is currently from 1999, it still contains useful information. Having a sense of what you need, and the kind of life you'd like to life will help you to understand why's the book is organized as it is."
1,Para nacos,"Definitivamente este disco es para el populo, para los nacos, para la raza, pobre naquito el que lo compre."
4,ms,This item should have been available in the store. I should not have had to pay shipping because the store did not have the item.
3,BYUBLU,"Nice product except aluminum is tough to get clean on insideof large pot and basket insert, even when using abrasive cleanser."
2,Not worth it,"We expected more from this product. It doesn't live up to the advertising. Plus, we thought it came with the mattress since it says ""tent bed"" in the description. Not worth the money."
3,No opinion,"A group that helps people ask me to purchase this for them, I did and I gave it to them. I have not heard any feed back from the people I gave it to"
2,Thin-Thin-Thin!,These pads are terrible. Very THIN - Almost see-through. I will never order these again.Very disappointed in this product
3,No great range,"I do like the style of this phone and headsets and the answering machine is good. However, the range is worse than my old 2.4 GHz phones. I've had to rearrange the base so I can have good reception with other phones in my house (which is a huge place!). It's working OK now, but I did expect better."
5,hilarious!,"I enjoyed this so much! LC is extremely talented, naturally witty, and made me laugh so hard it hurt. My fave parts were his jokes about his mother and his ""Super Obama"" bit. (Omg... hysterical!) One small criticism: He has a tendency to mumble every so often which made me have to rewind parts a couple times so I heard the full jokes. It didn't happen so frequently that I couldn't keep watching (obviously,) but I hope he gets over that for future shows. Otherwise, you won't regret watching this. EXTREMELY funny and the best new comic I've found in years!!"
3,It was ok,"This was an ok DVD, but I've heard most of these jokes on some of his other showcasings. He need new material."
3,Funny,I bought this because I saw Lavelle Crawford on another stand up comedy and he was funny. I enjoyed this one as well.
2,Likes to brag,"All this lady does is brag about her success stories. I have tried to get in touch with her to see if she could help my blind, epileptic poodle. I have emailed her coauthor and received no response. Hardly fits the caring, sharing image she presents in the book."
1,An offensive and anthromorphic insult to all animals,"This woman insults every animal on the planet with her self-serving, warmed-over anthromorphic dribble. As an anthropologist and zoologist, I am truly don't like this book."
2,"Vincent ""San Repro""","Vincent ""San Repro"" is at it again. This book is filled with reproduction ""prototypes"" which the author fails to mention are complete fakes that he created. There is a tiny disclaimer toward the back of the book which claims there are reproductions. However, in the body of the book, the author misleads collectors by showing several pictures of reproduction items that are passed off as the original. This book is a complete sham and a disgrace. Any longtime vintage collector will see right through it.If you are looking for a truly great book on the history of GI Joe, I suggest you read John Michlig's books. They have all authentic prototypes from the actual creators of GI Joe."
3,For the younger Kids,"Although it sounded fun, my daughter who is seven was rather bored with this. The sprinkler only goes a little ways and most of the bubbles were being popped by the sprinkler leaving her nothing to chase. I think we will just get the bubble maker and call this for about the three year old range."
1,DOES NOT HELP WITH 7.O,"My Netscape stopped working so I bought this book, even though I have Explorer 7.0. There is no help for 7.0. The mail system sucks and I really, really, really, hate this program! If anyone has a better plan of attack please let me know...............Good luck!!Susi J."
3,Some parts are crap some are really good,"I don't agree with him at all about the diet that he is recommending. If you ever have read ""The China Study"", then you know what impact this kind of diet has on your health.But what he writes about training is really really good. Combine this two books and your life will improve."
5,Maffetone Method,"This is the best fitness book that I can think of. I do not read these books very much because I am generally skeptical of these sorts of things. I must say this is an exception. Dr Maffetone is very pragmatic and sensible in his approach to fitness and this book could apply to anyone who reads it. I have run 3 marathons now and this has help me immensely in my most recent run. Additionally, I have been a competetive athelete throughout my life and I think this has improved my performance. You will not regret buying this book."
5,This book is awesome!!,I currently changed jobs and inherited a MetaFrame server farm with no MetaFrame experience. I needed a good reference for administration and optimization. This book does that and much more! The author covers the product in great detail and lists resources external to the book for further research. If you don't own this book you should!! I highly recommend this book to anyone using MetaFrame on W2K or NT4.0.
2,"Forget this one, go for Padmore.","What can I say about this recording? Bostridge's singing is unstylish, mannered and self-indulgent. He fails to touch, and to thrill. Several of the arias on this disc weren't written for a tenor in the first place, by the way. The playing of the OAE is the only joy on this disc. For a much more adventurous, exemplary programmed cd, which moreover is infinitely better excecuted and engaging, go for Mark Padmore's superb collection of Handel scenes and arias for tenor."
2,sweet dreams,"That cover thing with the legs grosses me out. They look like Rod's legs. I can't even look at it. It's like finding a dead bird in the yard. Heaven save the memory of this lad's Mercury years. For everyone enjoying this fizzy dreck, though, have at it. You could do far worse than having the rickety old mod croon a few for you before bedtime -- his -- and you throw a blanket over him and go into the den to see who's on Conan."
1,I would pay all the money in the world...,"To have this guy stop butchering the song titled ""What a Wonderful World"" (or any other standard for that matter). First of all, I can't believe he chose that song as a single. I saw him perform this song on Jay Leno and I now saw him sing on new years eve, and he SUCKS!!! It's painful to hear him sing such a great song... I mean, are his publicists listening? Is he listening? His voice is not smooth or refined enough for him to be singing ""Standards"". I'm sorry I tore you up Rod, but I just couldn't let you continue to humiliate yourself like that. I'm trying to help you here.If this is considered acceptable music today, then the music industry and the fans really need to reevaluate the state of music as it is today. It's about money now, not about the enjoyment you get from performing for your fans, or the good feelings you get from knowing you wrote and composed your own songs."
1,Karaoke sung by a moron for a bunch of musical morons,"The Great American Songbook. Yeah, right.You mean, ""The Great American Farcebook"", Mr. Stewart? So after years of singing rock trash, you turn back to the great body of songs that were recorded by the great ones before you, and you think you can do just as good a job as they did? WRONG, Mr. Stewart. And so are those musical morons who exclaim, ""awesome!"", ""smooth"", ""way to go"".I say to you, stuff it! Geez, go back to school and finish your Music 101, you bunch of imbeciles! Led by ""Turk Man"" from Arlington, you are beyond musical redemption.And so are you, Rod Stewart. To hell with you!"
1,"Rod, you are a star turned to dust",Is it really worth it? I mean sacrifice your reputation which you worked for 30 years for another million bucks.
2,"Stick to Rock, Rod...","I'll take a horny Rod over a neu-sophisticate Rod any day. It's as if he rehabilitated his wild-man ways and apologized to all the women he's ever ravaged over the decades. Yes! Decades. He's that old. The womanizing never stops. Yes, I know he was married to Rachel Hunter. But that married man does not eclipse the Wild Rod we all know and love.Remember the corny lost virginity lyrics of ""Tonight's the Night""? Cheesy, yet a lot of girls fell for it. The best was when he was doubting his own sexiness for a while when the glitter of disco was turning everything androgynous. Even Rod's rod. So he cried out, ""Do Ya Think I'm Sexy"" seeking affirmation.So now it seems the wayward prodigal son who couldn't stop tearing off women's clothes in a beast-like manner has finally approached the throne of civility, apologized, and donned a three-piece suit to replace the fading testosterone.Please, Rod. Just rock out. You'll find your mojo there."
1,This songbust was a horrible cd,This songbust was a horrible cd. What kind of title is songbook anyway. Every second i heard on this CD was painfull and scary. I wanted to rip my eyes and ears out of my head. Luckly i shut that crap off and put on some real music like the spice girls and backstreet boys.
4,You'll Love It -- For Sentimental Reasons!,"While the whole album was well worth the money, I particularly loved the re-make of this old Ink Spots tune. Wow! From the instrumental opening riffs to Rod Stewart's smokey interpretation of For Sentimental Reasons, I was entranced."
4,Great American Songbook,"If you loved American Songbook Vol.1, you'll love Volume 3. Good background music for when you are exercising or just taking it easy."
5,Rod Stewart STARDUST,"We have enjoyed all 3 of Rod Stewart's recordings ofthe music of our time.He has done a magnificent job !!This is the best of the three.We were given his first CD by our Grandson and were surprisedthat a rock and roller could realy sing the music of our time,and do it to our enjoyment."
4,Excellent,"Ben Harper attempts to send a message to all his listeners in each of his songs. Although HArper is successful in doing so, the lyrical construction in so many songs are quite simplistic and often do not hold ones attention. Despite this, though, most tracks are quite enjoyable. Overall a great album,especially if you are a fan of acoustic guitar."
5,A MASTERPIECE!!!,"If you've never heard this album, you absolutely should. Unfortunately, Ben's other albums do not approach this level of consistent greatness. On this album, he is soulful, edgy, poetic, angry & brilliant!"
1,Weak,"Here's an example of what not to buy. If you want Paula Abdul, skip this one and go on to the greatest hits or the early stuff. You'll like those, and you won't like Head Over Heels. There's a reason that nothing new ever got released after this flop. A Casio watch has more originality and dancability than this poor CD has."
4,best so far`,"this album, i thought was the best she put out, dont get me wrong i love paula's music and everyone laughs at me, im sure im not the only one. i just love the more grown-up sound it vibes out to us. if virgin records would or gave the album it's credit, there would be four or five top ten singles..my love is for real it's real fresh nothing out there now could put that song to the test..crazy cool i thought was outstanding if it was released at a remix if i were your girl absoulty would made a great single.. i really do think that everyone has this impression that paula bombed out for four years and never gave her the credit she should get, maybe if her fans put out a voice the album could be remixed and be re-released and put her back on the charts were she belongs"
2,Out of hand,"I am a little disturbed about all the negative reviews for this CD. Is it really THAT repulsive? I don't think that anyone is disputing that it's not a very good CD, but I usually reserve the one star rating for the most terrible CD's. Maybe someone can argue otherwise, but I wouldn't call this CD ""loathsome,hideous, or dreadful."" I would call it ""bad,"" or ""mediocre."" Paula Abdul did not do a very good job on this CD, but I didn't think it was terrible. It just wasn't very good. Maybe I am dice-ing words too much. People have their own ways of expressing themselves. I just don't want it to get too out of hand."
1,dump this!,"Yeah, just to tell ya that this don't fly here in the Motor City (Go Red Wings!). We need stuff a lot more industrial than this! This ain't workin' man's music, this is what little girls listen to. Any of them teenybobber bands don't work here. Thjis sounds like California type music. maybe new York. Here in Detroit we like our music raw, with an edge. garage bands. dump this. go buy some blues instead."
1,Speechless in Seattle,"Rarely do I find myself at a loss for words, but after listening to Paula Abdul's latest effort words could not decribe how putrid I felt. This cd is a journey through hell and back. I thought I was in pain when I dislocated my shoulder last fall, but that was nothing compared to this. The songs all have a dark undertone that borders on evil. I shudder to think what sort of ideas music like this instills into our children."
1,not a good recerd,this album is worsse than thge spice girls cd. Im sorry I spent good mony on this! whens the last time yuo saw paula adbul on mtv? dont by this!
5,Its a great Album... give it a chance,"paula abdul's third studio album has a lot going for it. paula's vocals are stellar as usual..its a shame this album didnt get a great reception when it was released..because it deserved better.with tracks like ""aint never gonna give you up"" to the pulse racing ""sexy thoughts"" paula takes you on a trip filled with funky beats blended with passion and soul..she has some ballads here that tug at the heart such as ""cry for me"" and ""missing you"" every song here has something unique to offer..give it a chance and youll see..but for me the crowning track here though has to be ""my love is for real"" the addition of ofra haza on that song adds a unique sound thats something special.Bottom line youll be head over heels for paula again too when you check this out.. lets hope that another album will come soon.."
2,Why so mean? :(,"Hello! opps i put the wrong thing in the box last time. hehehe...I heard this again and i read some reveiws and I see some people are mean about ones who dont like it. They say to ignore any bad reveiws and just read the good ones. some said there must have been listening to the wrong one. i think we sould read all the reveiws cause its important for us all to have a voice:) I listened to the right tape, Paula Abdul HoH and didnt like it much. some might like is worse than me and write a worse reveiw, and some might like it better, and thats ok. everyone has there opinion. Id say to read all the reveiws, listen to the music and then decide it you want it. glitter hello to all!"
2,Missing pages,"A good Verne travel story, but be aware that the Kessinger publication is missing two pages. (I had to go to the Library of Congress to find them.)"
3,Suprisingly good,This is actually a pretty damn decent cd. I thought it would suck but it was good. That's all I gotta say.
2,"Same old, same old...","For those who think that Outlanders is better than Deathlands, I hold this book up as proof it isn't true. Half of this book is retreaded info from the past few books. If you have never read any of the Outlanders, this info might be useful. However it makes for dull reading. Not only is it page after page of exposition, but it literally is word for word from the other books the info is taken from. There are good bits, the plot does eventually move forward. The characterization is well done. Unfortunately this is rushed and really only takes up the space of a good novella. Having said all that, however, this series is normally well done and interesting. I highly recommend them and the Cutting Audio full cast drama audiobooks are excellent and unabridged."
1,Rise to bogus,"This game sucks. Graphics, gameplay, sound, etc. The only good thing is that your thumb gets excersice.ONLY YOU CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE. -SmokeyPeace out."
5,I wish I could rate it higher.....,First of all this game is bad a$$ for those of us waiting on a martial arts game that is worth playing. Plus this game has the one and only Jet Li the worlds best martial artist. The control were great the fighting system makes you feel like you fighting the people like you want.the funny thing is that you can pick up trash cans and stuff and wrap people over the head with them. You have interactable enviorments. Blocks and Adrenaline make the game funner. the game is just all around a original. I look forward to RTH 2.haha
3,Good but not great,"this game is really fun. the only negative about this game is all the glitch but that's totally understandable because it's on the old generation system. some bad guy takes too long to kill, but other than that the gameplay is something new and really show how fast you moves.....7/10 overall!!"
2,my thoughts on RTH,"controls are horrible. they need to rethink the controls for attacking. graphics are great and the story is good. also, it is very difficult, not to mention fustrating, when trying to attack multiple enemies when they are all attacking at once. once you fall, they keep attacking and you don't have a chance to get up until half your life is gone. personally, it would be a good game to rent...not buy. i regret spending my money on buying it."
2,"Beautiful, but BEWARE!","Bought this chair over a year ago. Thought it was the most attractive highchair on the market. And ""Wow! She'll use it for years! Maybe she'll even use it as her desk chair when she's studying in college!"" Loved it up until this morning, when we had to call 911 after she pushed herself over backward (and was semi-unresponsive) in the chair. If you have hardwood floors, it works just fine...it slides back easily. We just moved to a house with rough stone floors and it does not slide at all (even after putting flet ""sliders"" underneath), therefore it tips backward with little effort. I hope you take this into consideration if you have stone or carpeted floors. Now I'll be looking for a chair with a tray."
1,The more things stay the same...,"I remember the first Minasi ""Mastering"" title I bought, and I liked it. It was funny, had some great information, and was easy to read. This one still has all of the same material. Unfortunately, it's also got a lot of material by Mark's co-authors, who don't write very well. I've found a lot of errors. And honestly, it's tough to wade through a thousand pages of material looking for what's new. I'm returning this and picking up Windows Server 2003 Delta Guide. It was recommended in a magazine editorial and promises to just cover what's new - and that's what I want. Mark, you should go back to writing the whole book yourself, and then it would at least be worth it for the humor."
1,Good...but not Great,"This book has ok for anyone that has the time and patience to read over 1,600 pages of text. I too agree with an earlier review that the book does contain too much ""fluff"" and does not get to the point of the pertinent material in a concise mannor. The small text is very hard to read and the glare from the glossy paper used to print this book make the book hard to read for more than an hour at a time.If you have already read the Mastering Windows Server 2000 by Manasi, don't waste your money on this book. About 90% of this book is just a reprint of the material in the previous book. Manasi would have done better in writing a book that was geared toward just the material that was new to Windows Server 2003 and saving about 1,000 pages in the process.My recommendation would be to find one of the other book that are available for Windows Server 2003 that are more ""to-the-point"" and specific to the subject matter of Microsoft's new Server 2003 release."
2,Difficult to follow,I don't know why everyone raves about this book. It is difficult if not impossible to follow. The chapters meander through topics and skip so many relevant topics as to make the book useless at times.
3,"Easy, entertaining read","Sometimes I think you can have too much of a good thing. I'm afraid that if Chiaverini keeps writing Elm Creek books, she'll weaken the series.That said, I did enjoy this book. It's a short read, almost a short story, really. The setting is the first Christmas that Sylvia is back at Elm Creek. Being back at the manor and decorating for Christmas brings back many memories for her. Much of the novel is reminiscing and because of that, there is a great deal of back story revealed. Some of it will be familiar to readers, but this novel adds additional details about Sylvia's history. For the record, her sister Claudia doesn't improve here, but enough story is revealed to soften my opinion a bit.This novel isn't necessary in order to understand or appreciate the series, but it is an easy, entertaining read."
2,Nothing new,"I was really excited to get this one and now I'm glad that I just got it from the library. There seems to be nothing remarkably new about these storylines, everything has been covered in the previous books. It is almost as if Chiaverini's publishing company encouraged her to write a ""Christmas book"" to take advantage of holiday gift sales and she just recycled everything she had already used. I'm disappointed and will be glad when she gives us something fresh."
2,Bad reaction,I started using Denorex and my scalp cleared up i give it 5 stars for that however i went and had my hair highlighted and it had a bad chemical reaction my head started burning so my beautician checked and there was a lot of heat coming from the foils so she rinsed my hair and it was literally smoking my hair is very dry and brittle i got very lucky cause i because i said something about the abnormal heat if i hadnt my hair would have probally fallen out and because of that i give this product a 2 star rating
5,Family friendly Sleepy Hollow - get some popcorn,"This is great family entertainment. Buy this video. I appreciate the attempt at this light hearted re-telling. Goldblum as Crane and Dick Butkus as Brom Bones are great. Also starring Paul Sand as Bones side-kick and John Sylvester White (Welcome Back Kotters ""Mr. Woodman"") as a paranoid believer in the Horseman with no head. If your a big fan of the Grizzly Adams tv series from the 1970's, this film has that same Schick Sunn Classic rustic look.Rick in Minneapolis"
5,The Legend of Sleepy Hallow starring Jeff Goldblum,"This is such a great movie!! Jeff Goldblum was perfect for the part of Ichabod Crane as well as all the other actors!! Why hasn't this been put on DVD yet? Our grandchildren are not able to watch the copy we have on VHS. Isn't there a way we can get it moved up with the times. It's something that shouldn't get lost, it's a wonderfully done version of ""The Legend of Sleepy Hallow"" and such a great story. Our young children as well as older grandchildren should be able to see this every Halloween season. It isn't even shown on T.V. anymore. What can we do?Maggie"
3,Not As Good As His Prior Work,"Because it's Lenny, it is very good. But I feel that it falls behind his previous works."
3,One more spin on the merry go round,"3 1/2Lenny's fourth studio was still intriguingly rocking enough to warrant a listen, but one could hear apathetic or redundant qualities beginning to creep into the compositional approach."
1,Don't buy it,"About a week after this DVD/VCR combo, it (DVD player) started skipping on some disks. I didn't think that it would be a major issue, but now it would not even play on some main stream disks. I put the disks in a $30 DVD player, and it worked fine.For folks who think that they're going to buy this SLV-D350P anyway because it's a Sony. I'm going to have to ask them: ""do you feel lucky today?"""
1,Stopped reading DVD's,"Apparently, I'm not the first to have the DVD side of this combo die. I've had it for a little more than a year and can no longer watch dvd's. I'm very disappointed. I thought maybe it was just mine, so I came to check the reviews. Guess I'm not alone on this one."
1,Avoid this unit,"Doesn't play some DVDs at all. For instance, I rented King Arthur (released 2004) and had to watch it on my computer as my SLV-D350 refused to read it. Now 6 months after I purchased it the DVD player refuses to play anything. It just tells me to check the disk for whatever I put in. After calling support regarding my 1 year warranty I am informed that the 1 year warranty is actually a 90 day warranty because labor is not included. I find out now that Labor is required for ALL units. So I can pay them (2+ hours of tech support phonetime) 25% the cost of the original unit and pay for shipping to get a refurbished unit that may or may not be the same Model #. I'd actually prefer a different model. Avoid this unit... Avoid Sony until they get their act together. My last Sony DVD player was great, I just wanted to try out a progressive scan model. I'm moving on and suggest you do to. At least avoid this worthless model!"
2,Very Disgusted,"I wish I had read these reviews BEFORE I purchased this piece of junk. Like others, my DVDs started skipping within a few weeks after I purchased it. The sales people suggested I purchase a disk cleaner and that did absolutely no good. I'm slowly giving up on the Sony brand. Quality has definitely left the building!!"
4,works ok for me,"I actually have two of these units and both work fine. I've had them for well over a year. I don't know - maybe I got lucky. I had one disc that would not play a few months ago but I just assumed that netflix sent me a bad disc. If you've already got one - don't despair, apparently not all are faulty."
3,No USB Connectivity!!!,"I've been using a USB adapter (specifically the Linksys 10/100 Adapter) to play PS2 games online, but this doesn't work on Socom 2. If you buy this game wanting to play online and don't already have the official Sony Network Adapter, expect to drop another $40. I think it's cheap that the makers didn't warn us about that. Other than that, this is a solid game."
4,Prefer single player missions,"I've never played the original SOCOM but bought and played SOCOM 2 instead. I started with single player missions first. They were absolutely first rate! The 12 missions were long and intense. I completed all of them in a month and a half. Then I gave online a try. It took some getting used to. I didn't enjoy the online aspect. You always have to go into the armory and change primary and secondary weapons as well as types of grenades before starting a game(gets tedious). In addition, when there are 11 rounds 5 minutes each in a game, they can get boring and repetitive fast, especially when one side(terrorists or seals) dominates. Plus, in online play, I hate it when some players lay down all their mines around themself and just nest out the entire time in some building just waiting for the enemies to come to him/her and kill themselves. However, I've also spectated some games and I was amazed/impressed at how skilled and expert some online players became."
5,Fun online and offline,"This game was meant to be the sequel to the already big SOCOM game for PS2. It launched the PS2 into the online era and is one of the best online games available for the console. Personally, this game is great online because of the ability to cooperate with teammates. Unfortunately, this game isn't for kids. The ESRB rating for this game is M for Mature. Plus, if you go online, then it really is a Mature game. There are some guys there that express their frustration in rather colorful ways. But if you meet the age requirement, and you like online games that you can shoot people and talk to others while doing it, then go for it. But if you're still a tad bit young, then wait a couple years."
4,Great Fun,"This Game is great fun. Not only is the regular game really impressive but the online version rocks!!!!!!! You can find me online usually in US East 11, 13, or 21. My name is Redman with a thing over the a or Da Rockwilder."
4,Very good game,"I think that SOCOM II is a great game, the levels are really fun in single player and they are fairly large. The only drawback is that you can't save in the middle of a level, and you have to do the level over if you die. This is frustrating when you get hit with a gun and die instantly. But, just to reiterate, this is a very fun game."
2,The Glitches,"1. On mission 9 when I had to rescue a couple of embassy workers; I planted a C4 on the door in the parking lot and instead of my team mate running away from the C4, they ran towards the C4 and began to prone next to it. So my bravo team got blown up and Jester started shooting at me.Not only that, when I had to defend the embassy for nine minutes. Some bad guys started shooting at me through the walls.Also when my one of my team mates close quarter combat with the bad guys, they both get rifle butted at the same time.2. On mission 11, the part when I had to escort a specialist. When I was in the tunnels, a lot of my guys got stuck behind crates and walls.Also I was behind doors trying to take out some bad guys when suddenly the specialist just ran into the room and gets wasted.Took me weeks to finish this game."
5,Mondays Stink! (but they don't have to),"I've read several self-help books during my career. Carl's book has a major advantage over most of them: it doesn't waste (my) time over-discussing the issues. It's short, to the point, easy to read, and most of all, useful. Buy a copy for your boss."
3,"Weak story, but good songs","As parent of kids who are big fans of the Wiggles, I was disappointed. You get the feeling that the story was made up as they went along; it is really rather weak and dull. My daughters love it however, and that's all that matters. The small sampling of songs is good; that's what the Wiggles should stick to."
4,A nice take on an over-saturated genre,This band brings more of a classic rock and traditional rock feel to emo. There are good guitar solos on this album and overall the music is pretty good. Compare that with some good vocals and a talented band of songwriters and you have a good cd. This CD has some appeal to people outside of the genre as well. Not your simple emo band.
3,Deary me,"SugerBrown is a dumbass. If u re-read what the other guy said, you'll see you're jsut being stupid. He never threatened anyone you stupid idiot. This CD is pleasant, not spectacular, but some good songs nonetheless. People need to stop being so pathetic and critising each other. yeah some people may love it, and some may hate it, but if you hate it, and criticise the CD and insult them, have a look at yourself and then see that they're probably achieving more than you..."
1,Ughhhhhh!,"This cd is crap! The music is dated, and it just came out. The only highlight is that guy Steve Smith who sing bground vocals. He's tight!"
1,Only send the tent,"whitout the mattress, so expensive for only a tent. Please review the picture and the product description, they are confusing"
3,Pacific Play Tent,"After a month of daily use it still looks new. Great product, just a little too much money for what you get."
2,Needs to be modified,"This tent is great during the day for my daughter to play in, but it is not good to sleep in the night time while closed. It only has two small windows with a mesh that hardly lets any air in. When zipped down, air is limited and your child will have very little air after a few minutes because the vent holes are too close together. Before I let my children use anything I try it out myself so if you want to see for yourself get inside of it close the zipper and wait a few minutes. You will feel no fresh air flow. I can only imagine after a whole night sleep. I don't recommend this tent for children with any respiratory problems or for it to be used if your child is sick because it will be a breeding ground for bacteria since there is poor air circulation. I love the idea but hardly use it because I have to take it off in the night time. The company needs to make the holes bigger so that there is more airflow. The size is great but could be better if it grips the mattress better."
2,"Not really ""Hats Off""","No one loves Laurel & Hardy more than I. However, in deference to Stan and Ollie's art, all copies of ""Utopia"" should be burned. ""Flying Deuces,"" a remake of the superior ""Beau Hunks,"" is mildly entertaining, but many of its gags are labored and contrived. Despite its weaknesses, however, the movie contains a supremely endearing scene, as Stan encounters the reincarnated Ollie in the form in which he wished to return--a horse.If you really love Laurel and Hardy, buy the very affordable 21-disc set of practically everything good they ever did (including foreign-language and colorized versions) and then shell out for a multi-region, PAL-converting DVD player. You will not be sorry!Note: Stan and Ollie did make a movie entitled ""Hats Off,"" which I actually saw at least part of on TV 50 years ago. However, that film has apparently been lost and is NOT contained on this DVD."
1,Not for kids!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"This game is not a game for kids under 14 to say the least. It is way too too violent. The gameplay is okay, graphics are good, replayability non existent. Okay game but not great. See Jak 2."
5,this is game of the year material,rachet and clank going commando is simply awesome. it is unbelivable how much action this game has. theres tons of robots tons of weapons and plenty of space to blast. going commandos weapons simply beat the ones in the first there bigger more deadly and more of a joy to use. kids will enjoy the platforming like elements while mATURE PLAYERS WILL ENJOY THE EXCESSIVE BLOW THINGS UP CONCEPT. the graphics are pheonominal. and this is the place where rachet and clank going commando really impressed me. the graphics are unbelivable. i swear it was like playing an xbox game. the graphics are rich in color overflowing in detail and i can garauntee you better than any graphics currently on the market in a ps2 game. you can look overhead and see things flying and moving. i forgot what bad graphics looked like.
5,addictive,rachet and clank going commando is great. so many platformers try to be good by introducing collectibles in the levels. well going commando has a more clever approach weapons. just to name a few theres the heavy lancer blitz cannon ryno 2 plasma coil hoverbomb gun the bouncer minirocket tube lava gun tesla claw unlimited roundup of upgradable weapons. there all really a blast to use.
2,jak 2 better,r and c going commando is pretty good. i think jak 2 is much better though. jak 2 is a longer more intresting game. yes going commando has giant clank battles the first one did too. yeah it has more weapons than jak 2. but you make a pick what would you rather have. a few really really good weapons. or a lot of not so good ones. the levels and rpg elemnts were kinda cool. the music and graphics were extremely good. but jak 2 is just better its new in every way. has more action more new elements and a much better storyline. going commando certainly deserves a rental but jak 2 is the one youd wanna buy.
4,Same game,"It's a clone of Racthet and Clank. If you liked the first one, you'll like this one. If you hated the first one, you'll hate this one. Everything is the same. Yeah, blaster vs mega-blaster. It's still all the same.Insomniac went a safe route with this sequel. They kept 90% of the original game, put in all new levels of course, and added enough special seasoning to attract fans of the first."
2,This phone is ok,I got this phone so that we would have a hard wired phone that would work during power outages. It does this very well. The biggest problem is that I bought it to hang on the wall and the holes provided in the back of the phone are non-standard and do not match the standard wall plate hanger.
4,A Sweet Romance.,"This a wonderful story with intrigue, passion, romance, and a cast of unusual characters. Readers of mideival romances are sure to enjoy this light interesting novel."
3,well written but lacking,"As with all his novel's, McEwan has beautiful prose. Its just that I never really connected to the main character. The story about the sad unraveling of his life and marriage was hollow without an understanding of who he really was before his tragedy. I found myself longing to be reading something else."
1,Regretful.,"I cannot believe that I paid almost 12 dollars for this book. I am a prodigious reader who has only ever been unable to complete a novel about twice in my lifetime. Well, this was a third time. What a load of waffling and blah-blah. Pages and pages of rambling, and while I recognise the intelligence of the writing, there was absolutely no character to relate to throughout the labourious task of ploughing through the novel to look for a redeeming chapter. My first and last ever Ian McEwan."
5,Fantastic release,The music is very high energy and a listening pleasure. The addition of the DVD gives a great story about this couple. However Gabriela's language definately requires parental supervision if there are children who will enjoy the performance videos. How can you not want to take your guitar and try the techniques after seeing the toutorial. Great CD.
5,Excellent!,"This was my first taste of Rodrigo y Gabriela, and I absolute love this album! I've recommended it to a number of people, and I continue to listen to it. There is more depth in the two guitars of Rodrigo y Gabriela than in many full bands out there. Every time I listen to this album, I get a ton of energy and want to get out and jam, dance, whatever. Again, excellent!"
1,The real story behind the duo,When I first saw them in concert I was amazed at her talent and his mediocrity. Then about 3/4 of the way through the concert they abruptly stopped and allowed a guy from some band not even on the play bill to run a tirade against the US government over immigration. I did not pay for that and if you buy their CD you support their anti American rhetoric. More whining about getting legal booo hoooIf you want to be abusive then let me know ahead of time so I can stay away from your concerts!
1,Not satisfied,"The second CD on this set did not play, I returned it for another set. The second CD on the second set also did not play. I returned it for a refund and still have not been refunded. Also, the sound quality is very poor. Sorry, not a good one to order. When can I expect my refund?"
5,great CD,"These two artists play spanish guitar with a different flavor. In addition they play an excellent spanish guitar version of ""Stairway to Heaven"""
3,Generic,"This album is fast, brutal, and all the players are very proficient (especially the drummer). Its good if you just want something aggressive and loud in your collection, but it lacks any kind of dynamics or coherence. Nothing particularly innovating or unique, and all the songs sound the same. I have a hard time listening to the album all the way through in one sitting. You cant even headbang to it really. I would give it about a 2.5."
5,A must read,This book I really could not put down. I do hope she keeps writting like this so I can keep reading. Thank you JANE Kirkpatrick.
4,"Like it so far, afte a month","Looked all over for sub-$900 unit with 1Gig and 100Meg+, and 64-bit processor. Never considered a Gateway, til I saw the beautiful screen, noticeably better than the HPs, etc. I'd say as good as a Sony screen. I actually like the keyboard, just a preference thing, though others appear not to like it very much. One note is to see the units with dual-core processors...they've dropped a few hundred in the past month since I bought this. Again, though, this unit is real nice for the price."
1,DO NOT BUY! Game will Freeze!!!!!!!!,This Game has issues. Many Bugs. Please look around and check out fourms. Many Many Many people have had issues with this game. I really wish I could get my money back. The game looks great and plays great..... but it will freeze during loading screens and in the middle of games. 2K sports will not help you if you have problems. :(
1,a.m.c. boutches another one,"once again a.m.c. has taken bad prints of these movies and passed them on to us. just the worst transfers i have ever seen. you can find better looking prints on other collections,so skip this dud and get them somewhere else!!!!"
1,Not to shabby,"For this price I would rather buy Radeon 9800, Radeon 9800 will Over clock at Pro, And the diffrence with ATI and Nvidia is huge especially with AA enabled."
4,Excellent Source of Information,This book provided good grounding information that I was able to use in my first wedding that I shot.It has good sample shots and provides some informaation on album design and layout. Starting the business and getting your services onto the web.
4,Keen is the new Dansko,"I love my man-clogs, I'll admit it. I've worn Dansko Stapled clogs for close to a decade as a teacher, but I've got to say I'm changing my views. I was given a pair of Keen Austin's (Woodbury color) for my birthday and I find them EXTREMELY comfortable. It's been quite rainy lately, and I have a serious issue with loosing my footing. I noticed today as I entered stores that I was apprehensive about slipping when I hit the tiles from the asphalt outside, but not a single slip or squeak for that matter. I'm quite impressed. I'm sold."
3,So stylin' but a defective tongue!!,"I'm a huge fan of keens, so I was surprised by this experience. I bought these for my husband who has hard to fit wide feet. Keens are perfect for him, but for some reason one of the shoes came with an extra long tongue. We could see that it was longer visually. We measured it and sure enough, one was obviously longer. We sent them back immediately for an exchange and we are hoping to get a good pair next time. The shoes were a perfect fit minus the ankle pain he got with the one shoe with the defective long tongue. I would still recommend buying these shoes, but measure the tongues when they arrive to make sure you won't have sore ankles later! Amazon is so great about returns/exchanges and made it so easy to exchange these for free. Now we wait and see if we get a good fit next time. We like the style of these shoes so much that its worth trying again!"
2,squeaky,"This is my 6th pair if Keen shoes. I bought them to wear in Europe where walking is the main form of transportation. They were fairly comfortable right out of the box like Keens usually are. I read about people having issues with the sole coming unglued and know that has been a minor issue with some of my other pairs as well. I simply stick it back on with shoe goo and I'm back in business. The problem with this pair isn't so easily fixed however. After a few days of wear, I started hearing a squeak coming from my left shoe. It appears to have come unglued in the middle of the sole under the ball of my foot. Now as I walk, the sole and base of the shoe rub together and squeak. It's very annoying and I can't get in there with shoe goo:( I'm not sure if I send them back or cut open the bottom and attempt to glue them?"
3,4th pair of Austins. Quality is hit or miss.,"I've owned 4 pairs of these, and this is my second pair that is going back for warranty replacement because of a horribly annoying squeak in the heels. My black ones never squeak, but the potting soil color always does when the heel is squeezed.Also, one of the tongues is longer than the other by almost a full inch. Odd.I once heard them compared to clown shoes because of their odd shape.They are quite comfy tho."
4,Nahyra...Muy buena salsera!,"""De Vuelta Al Sabor"" es un muy buen disco de salsa, y mas cuando el productor del disco lo es Luis ""Perico"" Ortiz. Los temas ""La Soledad"" y ""Que No Quede Huella"" son los mejores. Nahyra es una exelente exponente de este genero tropical."
4,Complenations are complenations,This is a complenation. From the year 1992. Yes it is. I am not joking either! It has music from alternative rock bands. Its rare. My favorite band on here is Rage Against the Machine.
1,Dog not Scary,"This is what happens when there isn't a current genre of horror out there. In the 80's it was the Freddy's and Jason's that scared the hell out of everybody. Nowadays, it's the college trillers. But this movie creates horror for horror sake. It does not play on any real fears that people are scared of. It does not even refer to the dog in this movie as a pit bull either. This remake and reselling of Cujo is a disappointment."
4,Very satisfied,The book arrived in as good or better condition than I expected. I would definitely buy from this seller again.
1,Missing the Table of Contents,"The Table of Contents is completely missing. It shows up when you view the preview of this book on Amazon, but does not exist in the textbook. I thought it was probably a mistake from the factory, so I ordered a replacement, SAME PROBLEM. A reference book without such a table is extremely difficult to use. I'm not sure yet whether I'll return it or keep it. Very disappointing, since otherwise it seems like a great book."
1,Save your money,"Every year a new class of desperate students buy into the Schaum no-help books. Save your money or try Michael Kelley.Sincerely, Bert-Chapel Hill, North Carolina"
2,Not What I Expected,"First of all, these songs are all remakes, and not very good ones at that. Second, where did anyone get the idea that ""Macho Man"", ""Let's Go Dancin'"", and ""Disco Inferno"" are Halloween songs? All in all, I was very disappointed in this cd. Save your money- this is not worth it."
3,OK For Price--Lithium Battery Didn't Last Long,"We bought the three pack when a recent bathroom remodel project triggered Calif building codes to have alarms in more places in the house. Certainly the price was right. The lithium battery died this week--about a year after purchase, but a date stamp on the inside says 2009 Nov 19, so it may be that that the the alarms weren't all that new when we bought them (not from Amazon). Its just that I thought the display container in the store suggested that the battery lasted a lot longer--but a year later--who knows. The alarm chirps once a minute when the battery is low. Battery replacement was a breeze. Contrary to some reviewers, I don't see any problem with the mounting rings plenty solid once installed in the wall or ceiling. I'm not willing to fill the house with smoke to find out if these actually work!!"
1,Complete Garbage,If you depend on this smoke alarm you will be sorry...it is not sensitive...it doesn't do anything...cleaned my electric oven with electrosol(creates alot of smoke) ... this alarm sat quietly ... don't depend on this alarm to save your life...it won't.
4,Excellent Guide but focused on Major M&A's,"This is a great book which I have used a few times whenever we have gone through the evaluation of an acquisition. However it is very much focused on larger organizations, and has less application for SME's. It is certainly worth the cost, especially the section on post-merger activities."
4,john on his own,"John Herndon was the first of three openning acts for Prefuse 73 in NY last year. Performing completely on his own, using a drum kit, drum synths, a synthesizer and a laptop, he proved that he's got a lot of chutzpah. However he left most people scratching their heads, performing some amorphous noise that he occasionally punctuating with rollicking percussion. This ep shares the same sense of oddity but is ultimately rewarding, giving the listener a more polished experience. However, there are no tightly woven songs, leaving the impression that these tracks are mostly improvised. ""Red Hat Attack"" features occasionally inspiring mc Dose One, though in a less inspiring moment."
5,Quite possibly the tightest and most enjoyable jazz ever!,"DIG are a fantastic Australian jazz/fusion/funk band. If you have't heard them, imagine something between Miles Davis and Weather Report. The grooves in this album are tighter than anything else I have ever heard. The musicians seem at home in the mix, never crossing that boundary of becoming to protuding yet maintaining the sweetest rhythm. Every second track or so on this album is an improvised jam, recorded for fun. It really shows off the talent that these guys have. The more constructed studio tracks too, show off the musicians' amazing talent. The most awesome sax solos ever can be found here. I highly recommend the album, it's one I have had for quite some time now and I just keep comming back to it. Top stuff."
4,3rd Saw Still Has Teeth...,"After years of silence, the buzz came back and louder than ever. After the disappointing over-violent Texas Chainsaw 2, it was a relief to see that this film went back to the roots of the evil. Full of dark humor, but plenty of gore and horror to sustain true horror fanatics. One of my favorite horror sequels ever, this film features great fast paced direction from Jeff Burr.Great chases, stylish camera work, and an almost believable story. I took one star off because I have never known a chainsaw work under water before. But hey, the saw IS family!"
4,blood and comedy,"this film is cheesy, stupid, mostly bad acting and worth purchasing if your a true fan of the genre! I love the black actor in this film, he was also great in the original ""dawn of the dead"" of the late 70's. some of the best cheesy one liners in horror film history are in this flick. i give this one 4 stars. so if you love ""the texas chainsaw massacre"" and love horror films, i say spark up a bowl and enjoy the film!"
3,A Good Remake Of The First!,"This movie is very well filmed. The 'Leatherface' in this one is the coolest one. He's got some weird leg-brace. The starting is very believable. It looks like the man who gets shot, is a good guy. But, he's really evil. That's why I gave this movie three stars. This movie is worth renting. Hoo-Ahh!"
2,Plenty disturbing but not scary or gory as it should be,"A couple are chased on a deserted Texas road by leatherface and his family of retarded and demented cannibals. Plenty of chase scenes and cannibalism, but not nearly as much gory death scenes as fans would want."
2,Obviously not worth it...,Considering I found this dvd in Walmart for $10 I thought I was literally in for a treat.Not likely.First off my main problem with the girls is that they lip synched too much throughout the whole show.They could've at least redid the backing vocals instead of them obviously sounding like Beyoncé.I saw the same exact show live and it had way more energy than this excuse of a performance.It must've been taped during the end of the tour because all 3 girls looked tired.If you literally want your money's worth I suggest you pick up Beyoncé's Live in Wembley show because her performance of Dangerously in Love was weak compared to a more matured version on her dvd.Don't even get me started on Michelle's song Heard A Word.Babygirl was straining to hit the high notes towards the end and I'm surprised it wasn't edited out because she sounded bad!.I love the girls to the heart but this was a bad idea.
1,Not much use,"For a compilation that pretends to deal with contemporary art, this volume is surprisingly outdated, tending to focus on issues in art practice that are at least a decade old. Additionally, it is surprisingly uninformed on a disturbing number of issues. A case in point, two writers, including the editor, mis-read and misunderstand McLuhan, and are even unable to get the basic idea that the medium is the MASSAGE, not the medium is the MESSAGE. If you want a book that informatively and insightfully deals with current issues in art, I suggest you look elsewhere."
1,A very disappionted child,"She loved the toy, but after the first day the batteries died and the lights stopped working. So I changed the batteries and it worked for a day and the batteries died again. Plus you can't hear yourself over the music on the mic and the lights pic up static when the mic is on. Unfortunately the toy is going back."
1,junk,"My son received this as a gift. It barely amplified his voice, but made lots of annoying sounds and had flashing lights which he thought were fun. I use the past tense because within 2 days the thing was dead. Not the quality or fun I expect from Little Tykes."
5,"Irwin Naturals - 3-In-1 Joint Formula, 90 gelcaps","Purchased product based on reviews and pleased with the results after one week of use. Knee pain is reduced and mobility increased. Added and unexpected benefit has been the remission of a fibromyalgia flare up. Other products have not worked as well, so 3-in-1 was worth the try."
5,Watering Made Easy Great Product,"Since I have bought this product on several occasions, this review might seem redundant. Outstanding product for watering your lawn without dragging around sprinklers each time you need to water. Merely put the station in the ground and ""quick connect"" your hose when you need to water. I have placed a total of 5 of the stations in my front and back lawns and can now water very simply without the cost of a full irrigation system and I don't have to fool with moving and adjusting sprinklers all the time. Great product!"
3,"It works, but you'll need more than you think","I have what is called a parkway strip in front of my house that is very difficult to water (about four feet wide and 50 feet long). Using the published spray pattern of 4x30, I should have been able to cover this strip with two SS13's. It takes four as the pattern is more of an arc than a rectangle and you need to overlap them by about 25% for good coverage. As long as you know that going in, it is still a good way to water small, strange shaped areas. I use four short hoses and a four ganged hose manifold to power them all at once as my city pressure is good enough to supply the water to all four."
1,not so hot,"We love the original Watering Made Easy sprinkers we installed, but are dissappointed with this one. Of the two we ordered, one just fizzled. I made the mistake of ordering 9 sprinkler stations around the same time. By the time we finally installed the last one, it's too late to return it for a refund."
1,you must understand,"Reading this book is a waste of your time. It should have been titled: ""You must understand."" Navy must have used that phrase at least a hundred times, like he is enlightened and the rest of us are idiots. The book is full of factual errors, misspelled words, grammatical errors and trite phrases. Its obviously a self-published book as no editor would have ever approved this clap-trap rubbish."
5,Thought Provoking,"After reading this book, one would wish that most be people in this country had the same insight as the writer of these essays. From the political essays to his religious essays, I would found every word interested. My mind grew with every page I turned. Please read and learn."
3,Cappucino Isabel Slingback Sandal,"I generally can wear a size 37 (US women's 7M) with no problem. However, this shoe, although very stylish was extremely too small for my foot as well as several other women who wear the same size and tried it on."
3,"Bronx Women's Isabel Slingback Sandal,Cappucino","I like the shoes (style), but the little metal dots will grind into your toes and hurt horribly while you are walking. In fact, because of this I have only worn them twice and the second time when I know that I would not be doing a lot of walking. I tried to put something to cushion those areas, but it shows which looks gaudy."
1,Big Pile of Garbage!,"MacMillan Publishing (Sams) has done it again. Put out a instructional book which its only goal is to get your money.Sams needs to stay out of the Linux arena until they are willing to do more research on the subjects they write on.Really, the online help that comes with Star Office 5.0 is far superior to this publication.. and it's included with the program.. for FREE!Stay clear of this publication... or any Sams put out on the subject matter concerning the Linux OS. They are clearly out of their element here."
1,Don't waste your money,This book gives out no secrets - it is more of a fanzine. Don't waste your money. The Creature From Jeykl Island is better history and Web of Debt is better current events.
4,Very informative but too detailed,"An informative and entertaining book. It explains how the the Federal Reseve operates and control the money supply; but this information is mingled with the events of the the 1980's. My main motivation for reading this book was to acquire this knowledge. It was very interesting to learn what happened behind the scenes in the White House as it struggled withthe 1980's recession. The book, however, gives too many examples of howpeople reacted, essentialy repeating the same message. This book couldhave been half as long without losing any of its value."
3,I still don't really understand the fed.,"It was a well written history of the fed, but I would have liked more details on the interactions between the fed, the treasure, the banks."
5,Palomino Arabian,"First off Arabians don't come in shades of Palomino I know Palominos have a little Arabian in them,but Arabians can't be Palomino they can be Dappple Grey, Paint, bay or black, besides that this toy is soo cute with it's loving eyes and it's heartwarming look I have the paint one,but this Arabian shows way more love no wonder kids like this spunky sweet mare."
5,why to buy,"This Chesnut would make a great addition to any horse collection.First you may want to buy it and see if you like it.Then if you would like to buy extras,you should do so."
1,Horrible comany,"I bought an ink cartridge from here and the ink was all over inside the bag and the company wont respond to any e-mails about an exchange. Terrible, I would advise against doing business with them."
2,Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures.,"I've read many bead books and this is without a doubt the most confusing with its poorly written instructions. For one thing the authors apparently think that seed beads are ""indian beads""or ""Native American"" beads because that's what they call them. What does this even mean,it's beyond ridiculous it's plain stupid terminology. Daisy chains are called ""blossom chains"" for no reason. The graphs at first glance seem simple until you actually attempt to do the project then you realize it's unclear and confusing. Your actually better off eyeballing the pattern and freeforming rather than wasting your energy deciphering these patterns. Don't be fooled by the pretty pictures.There is better information for free on the internet how to sites."
2,Bad value/price ratio,"It works, however to achieve a same effect as 1 pill of a regular yohimbe bark extract(light sweating, light jittering) i have to take 6 pills on an empty stomach upon wakeup, and 8 pills during a day. 2 stars. Ordered a regular yohimbe bark extract."
2,I don't know,"I don't have any indication this works, and it does make me a little nauseous when I take it.Hard to evaluate vitamins and supplements but I know I took it as directed and didn't lose any weight so that's the limit of my ability to judge."
5,Excellent Insight,This book opened a doorway into my stepdaughters behavior. I would highly recommend it to anyone. It was written in an easy to understand way and offered ways to correct the problem.
5,Wonderful Dance music,This CD makes anyone listening to it start to move and do your body movement thing ; oDefinately feels like a party's going on or maybe should. You'll enjoy owning and playing this CD alone or with company. Good buy Folks!!!!
2,Not pleased at all,"I purchased this book because I love forensic anthropology mysteries and I believed this one would fit the bill. I was sorely mistaken. The plot dragged on and the whole premise for the book with the main character being asked to be a spy was stupid. I finished reading it only because I hate to leave a book unfinished but I won't be buying anymore of this series because my thought is, if the first book is this boring, the rest can only be the same. So sorry I bought this one but it was pretty cheap and it's a lesson learned."
3,New author for me.,"Since I have bought my Kindle I have been introduced to quite a few great new authors. When I read the reviews on Aaron Elkins I ordered all three of his books in the Gideon Oliver series. I liked this book but it just didn't draw me in like Cornwell, King, Koontz, Patterson, Robb...etc. He's a good writer, but IMHO I think he could have written a bit different to keep me wanting to pick up the book. I felt like it lacked something. I'm hoping his last two books will change my mind."
3,a typical anf photobook,"This book does not really have many stories, it has lots of pictures! I think that the title is misleading.And as some of his books, this book has lots of random pictures. Some are good, some are not. Quite a few are homoerotic. Among all the pictures, there are about two male frontal nudities.This is just like a typical abercrombie and fitch magazine, and it has stories instead of clothes that they want to sell to you."
4,Perfect Solutions Golf Bag Utility Belt,"This is a good belt as it does the job. I would like to have known the length of the velcro portion of the belt. It was a bit long for my bag, and the velcro came up short when I cinched the belt. I also didn't need the water bottle pouch. The pouch sat in an odd location when I got the belt to a spot and set-up I liked. I just took the pouch off."
2,Bait and switch ????? NOT what I ordered !!!!,"I have to agree with the other reviewer, L.Ricci. I ordered the ""Illuminator LED Crank Flashlight"" that was shown at both Amazon.com AND also on the Beall's website, but was sent ""Smart Tools Dynamo LED Flashlight."" True: it IS a crank-type flashlight and it DOES have 3 little lamps. However, you have to push the ""ON"" button three times to get it to actually shine. This makes me think clicks ""one"" and ""two"" are supposed to turn on only one bulb, then two bulbs and finally all three like some of the higher priced (more dependable ??? crank lights) and therefore this one is NOT working properly. I WILL complain directly to Beall's."
5,Review for Photo Album,"The photo album turned out to be just what I was looking for! It was rustic, recycled and well made. We love it!"
4,VERY GOOD BOOK,"A GOOD BOOK WITH A REALISTIC DESCIPTION OF THE GOVERNMENT. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT AGREE, HAS NEVER HEARD OF RUBY RIDGE AND THE BRANCH DAVIDIANS IN WACO. TO THIS DAY THERE HAS BEEN A COVER UP BY THOSE IN THE GOVERNMENT ABOUT THOSE INCIDENTS JUST TO NAME TWO."
2,VERY MISLEADING!!!!!,"The back cover of a book usually tells what a book is about, but not it this case. It is about a man who is over 700 years old and cannot be killed. He can turn from a man into a wolf and back into a man again when ever he wants. Many, many people are sent to find him, to many people to keep up with--very confusing. The main thrust of the book is the screw up of the federal government in the way the affair is handled. This may happen quite a bit but I don't need Johnstone to tell be about it in a book that is supposed to be about something else. I quite reading the Mountain Man series and The Last Gunfighter Series because each book was about half filled with what had happened in a previous book. Think I will quit reading Johnston all together. He will never know it and will continue to publish many, many books and make mucho dinero. I would not advise anyone to buy any of the Johnstone books except the early Mountain Man books or the Preacher books. They were so good."
