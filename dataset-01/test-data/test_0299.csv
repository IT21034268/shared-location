5,One of my favourite books!,"A remarkable book! I could not put this down. It was one of the most entertaining books I have ever read. It is no wonder that Whoopi Goldberg's company purchased the screenplay rights. Lansen's character development is wonderful, you leave this book feeling like you knew the characters personally and know you will remember them for years to come."
1,Dont even bother,"If you listen to Wendy don't even bother buying this book.. Everything you will read, she discuss on the show. Was Boring did not have me off the edge of my seat....I still enjoy listening to her on the radio but not reading yesterday news..."
3,WENDY STILL TRIPPIN(LOL),Wendy just bein wendy. nothing change. much like the radio show. the female version of howard stern..why not. tel it wendy!check out she did that by kerry e. wagner wendy. i dare u to talk about him and he find out(lmao) its gon be some smoke in the city as i heard hi say
2,"Same ISH, Different Day!","First and foremost, if you listen to Wendy's radio show, do not waste your money on this book. Quite frankly, all of the material covered in the book has been covered on her show more or less. Additionally, many of the interviews are plagued with answers like ""no comment"" or Wendy will actually tell the reader that she will not publish certain parts of an interview.This is the second book that I have read of Wendy's and this is the second time that I was disappointed. It won't happen again as I will no longer waste my time! Wendy should stick to what she does very well and that is her radio show. She is trully the Queen of Radio not the Queen of Writing."
3,Wendy Williams has floor-scraping balls!,"This lady does not hold back - a characteristic that makes for very interesting reading. In The Wendy Williams Experience she plainly and unapologetically provides juicy details of celebrity interviews. She boldy states how she feels about the biggest names in showbiz - P. Diddy, Mariah Carey, Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, and spares no mercy. Yikes! The book raises eyebrows but you do wonder about the author's motives. Does she sincerely care for celebrities, does she want to be bigger than the celebrities, or does she just get her kicks exposing celebrities? At least she admits to getting plastic surgery - but I'm not sure the surgery does her any justice. At any rate, the book is an explosive pageturner, and offers eye-opening insights into the lives of well-known stars."
3,Good for a Ball workout,I like this video because I could do everything she does in the first go through. I think it moves along nicely and I can get a quick workout in just a 1/2 hour. I found the abs section to be a welcome relief from just a series of endless crunches.
4,15 Easy to Intermediate Christmas Favorites: Clarinet,It was great! I'm a beginner and it has easy music and music that challenged me.
1,Not leakproof at proof as stated.,"First, the item was dented on the side when box was opened . I tested to fill up some water prior to using it and noticed that it can not at all retain the water. Anyway , I tried to bake a bread that require some butter , Orange bubble bread, and butter started to drip in the bottom of the oven. If this is really a true leakproof it should not leak at all. Prior to purchasing this item, I read all these reviews and mostly all these reviews are good, some even say its a leakproof. Maybe they are not telling the truth so people will buy and experienced the same like they experience. NO I would not at all recommend this product to my friends and to anybody who is shopping this type of pan. Amazon should not be marketing this kind of product until the manufacture fix this problem, LEAKAGE."
5,First rate,"With my wayward brother George doing another spell in the jug this guide helped me learn all about prison argot. It gives me no pleasure to see him there behind the glass with his botched tattoo, looking all forlorn and grovelling for phone-cards, but at least I can now ask him whether he's yet been hammed by any of his wing's gravy hounds; which is a start."
4,life lessons,My son loved this story from the first time we read it in a doctor's waiting room. Pickles is a mixed up cat who learns that he can do good things. He learns to share the fire house with other cats and to help the firemen. The day that he saves a cat from the tree where he had been stranded once is a great day for him.
5,A true American Hero,"Okay, maybe that is an exaggeration, but Fire Cat was one of the first books I read as a child. I was thrilled when I found a beat-up copy at a garage sale a few years ago, thinking I had the last copy on earth. Then, working in a local bookstore, I saw it was still in print. How cool is that? Very cool, my friends, very cool.I highly recommend this for your favorite little people. It teaches that everyone has goodness within them, if given a chance."
4,"Good pan, but order 2","These are great pans for pineapple upside down cakes. But if you are using a full box mix you will want two pans. One will not handle all the batter. Bit of a uni-tasker, but it makes for a nice presentation."
4,Decent B Movie,"Kids from broken homes and poor families living on the rooftops of newyork city, guy falls in love with girl whos cousin is a drug dealer using the building to make a deal and to kick out all the kids and put them on the street. they have to fight to keep what little they have left. stylised visuals of gangsters, graffitti, latino life and poverty. good pacing, good action, decent story and acting, entertaining to watch."
5,Firewalls,Informative book very detailed on the hows and whys was able to setup two different kinds of bastion hosts/firewall within days of reading book
2,Riddled with errors,"This book does a great job of explaning the theory behind netfilter firewalling with iptables. Every concept is backed up with a concise script.And this is precisely why you should avoid this book.Page after page is riddled with glaring errors. Some scripts produce syntax errors. Others yield unexpected results. Entire passages are copied and pasted out of context. Only a handful of errors can be chalked up as mere typos.I spent too much time correcting mistakes that could have been better spent studying the material. If you must read this book, don't blame yourself when you get lost-- the proofreaders were lost as well."
5,Get your hankie ready!,"This story is a wonderful, wonderful love story! I can't express to you how much I enjoyed it. It was emotional and beautiful and made me both laugh and cry, then rejoice at the wonderful ending. You've got to read this one!"
3,"Great literary work, although a little pretentious","I recently read Old School by Tobias Wolff after hearing about it from several friends who had read it for book club. Although it is pretentious at times and has a literary snob quality, the author writes vividly, placing the reader in the shoes of a scholarship boy at a prestigious east-coast prep school in the 1960s.The plot revolves around visits by modern literary giants including Robert Frost, Ayn Rand and Ernest Hemingway. The boys compete in writing contests, with the notable prize of a private visit with the visiting author. The main character analyzes his own writing, the writing of some of America's most prominent authors and the writing of his peers.For anyone who loves literature or has attempted to write fiction him/herself, the expression of that process in this novel is provoking. This is a quick read, and the insights you will gain about some of your favorite authors makes this novel worth it!"
4,A lesson in writing,"This book is sure to please Wolff fans, as well as those who are fans of the craft of writing. It is about a student at a Massachusetts prep school in 1960 who repeatedly enters essay contests where the winner gets to meet with famous writers (Rand, Heningway, Frost) visiting the school. About two-thirds of the way through, there is quite a plot twist, which I won't give away. My lone lament is that it came so late. The book reads as something of a memoir prior to that point (and gets a but slow, albeit still enjoyable). It is really a hybrid of a memoir and extended short story, if that makes any sense. It is not a novel in the classical beginning, middle, end sort of way. Overall though, certainly in the 90th percentile."
4,Lets See,"I bought my 04 F250 XLT Crew Cab 4X4 Turbo Diesel new in 04 and at 61K I'm doing the pads... I wanted OEM since if I can get another 60K out those in over 7 years from now I'll be happy. Stay tuned, I'll be back in 7 years with an update."
1,It'd be great if they'd sent me the right book...,The book in the description and the photo were not the book they sent me. They send me the original Body for Life.
5,A Huge Favorite,"It's always healthy to look at things from a different perspective. In this book the three cuddly little wolves with soft fur and fluffy tails are chased by the big bad pig who they don't call big and bad for nothing. This book is very funny and the ending proves once again that the only real way to rid yourself of an enemy, is to make him your friend. My children request this book often, and the Spanish version Los Tres Lobitos Y El Cochino Feroz is a great suppliment for our Spanish lessons."
1,Pacifist Propoganda,"This book seems to be an anti-American story of pacifist propoganda, even if that was not the author's intention. I'm getting rid of this book right away so that my kids know that a) it's okay to stand up for themselves when occasion calls for it, b) they actually have to work hard (instead of getting handouts) in order to obtain the necessities and luxuries of life, and that c) figuratively building a ""house of flowers"" is generally not an effective way of dealing with people who are determined to cause them harm. Again, I'm not accusing the author of conveying that message intentionally, but regardless of his intentions, those are the messages conveyed in this book."
1,The Three Little Wolves and the Big Bad Pig,We've all read the story about the Three little Pig's and the Big Bad Wolf. I thought this book was an hilarious twist on the original. Seeing the three wolves terrified of the big bad Pig something new and fresh.
1,Laughably inaccurate.,"I bought this booking thinking that it would be an interesting read on a view contrary to most about Reaganomics. However, the author as another commentor said, goes way to far in trying to blame everything wrong with America on Reagan, also he stretches his connection with events to Reaganism to the extreme. Quotes and theories are taken so far out of context it is laughably inaccurate. The book wsan't as interesting as I had hoped, more of a leftist rant on our mid-right nation."
1,Yuck,"Just like other reviewers, I thought I was ordering a book by Walter E. Williams. I was ready to read factual arguments about Reaganism and thought I was getting a book by Walter E. Williams. I didn't even know who ""Walter Williams"" was. As soon as I received the book and read even a little bit, I realized it was a leftwing diatribe and stopped reading. It takes a lot for me to do this because I believe books to be sacred objects, but this book is no sacred object, so I threw it into the trash where it belongs.The ONLY reason this nasty book got rated one star is because there isn't a ""no star"" rating that I could choose. To reiterate the title of my review: YUCK."
5,"A good book, though slightly confusing. Still good!","The heroine may be a bit weak and naive at first, but she changes well over time! And the magic... well, what can one say? A good book. Let's all hope for a sequel real soon."
5,loads of fun!,"Yeah, okay, this movie is educational and empowering to us lesbians, and it's wonderful that Nan finds true love. But what I really fell in love with was Anna Chancellor as the domineering aristocrat Diana Lethaby. She was gorgeous and such a scene-stealer, I don't know why people haven't mentioned it in their reviews."
3,"Good .NET instruction, but not very Delphi-centric","I was initially disappointed by this book, though now I am only slightly negative. In the book, the author provides a good overview of how you can use Delphi for .NET and ASP.NET. I did learn a lot about .NET and am better prepared for the migration.However, this looks and reads like an editted C# book. Except for a few pages (literally one chapter), there is very little about Delphi. The examples are in Delphi, which helps with the understanding, but the author uses the Microsoft .NET libraries and DOES NOT USE EVEN ONE of the Borland specific libraries like VCL.NET, etc. in his examples.Overall, an educational book, but not what I was looking for."
1,Dont buy 1 of these by Covercraft!!,"Dont waste your money on this Covercraft hood bra!! I hated the material. It didnt fit over my hood like a glove. It never wouldve stayed on because it was already too big. I also hated how it hooked to the underside of my hood. Ive had a Colgan Custom (who is the founder of the car bra) on my other vehicle for 9 years, dont know why i switched. I know why, because i tried saving some money, big mistake. Do yourself a favor and buy a Colgan Custom. Yes, they are twice as much money, but it is totally worth it!!"
5,Very pretty,"I like to paint using photo references of places that I can't go to, or of scenes that are difficult to come by often. The photographs here are delightful to look at as well as to paint. The text has some errors; it seems to have been written by a non-native speaker, but the photos are glossy and well-shot."
4,Great,"I have used several of these and only had 1 coaster. I have gotten 2 groups of these. The first group was made in Singapore and I had no coasters, the second group were made in Taiwan and have the 1 coaster out of 6 used."
2,Very narrow thickness range,"1/2"" to 9/16"" is a very narrow thickness range. Some cover 3/8""-5/8"" while others cover 1/2"" to 1 1/4"". I prefer to avoid the extremes of the recommended range, but there's no margin in the range publicized for this bit."
1,English 101,"I have a child with spina bifida so I can certainly comiserate with the plight of Karen Snyder Travis and her family. However, what I cannot do is tolerate the unbelievably poor grammar used in this book. Many misspelled words are peppered throughout this quick read -- I was too distracted by all of these errors to focus on the story.And, about the story -- it is entirely too ""matter of fact."" Ms. Travis tells us what happens to Christal as if she were relaying information to a physician -- it's not storytelling. Storytelling is an art, a true talent that not many people posess. Unfortunately, Ms. Travis was not blessed with it.As eager as I am to get my hands on the too few books out there about families living with spina bifida, this is the worst one of I've had the misfortune of reading. I wish I hadn't even bothered.Bottom line: don't waste your time."
1,Midland products in General,Midland products in general do not work that well. I never got t use this product because I sent the radios back and the company I purchased the charger from would not even take the it back. That should tell you something. Find a different product other than Midlands they are Cr@P.
2,This movie is horrible!,This movie is horrible. It was such a waste of money and time. It's not one of those movies that you can watch twice.
1,BUYER BEWARE,"The only thing silver about this watch is the color. It haS a plastic ""crystal"", and is powered by a non-replacable battery. Came in a nice, wooden box that is probably worth more than the watch.I could have bought a better watch @ Wal-Mart for under 20 bucks. Can't return it because it has been engraved. Thats where they get you! BUYER BEWARE!!!!"
3,The Second One Works Great,"Received the unit and although it was a bit larger than I expected, it met our needs, at least until it started intermittent, random beeping. After contacting the company and receiving a very quick response, I was told a certain number of units were defective in this regard and that I should return the unit for full replacement.Thus far, the second unit seems to be working as advertised. If you order one and it has the ""random beeping"" problem, be sure to return it immediately for replacement!"
3,It's okay,"Seems to work fine, I just wish it would not beep when you push the light button to read it in the middle of the night, wakes the wife up!"
4,Good Book,"I bought this book as a gift. It is a quick simple book to read. If you think about it, the book is charged with more than 4000 years of documented history. My second reading of Angles I flagged many pages so that in my third perusal it is going side by side with my Bible in hand. It may give one an opportunity for introspection and revelation if you are open to it; or just modern language illustration of the gift of Angles among us at this very moment. In any case you will enjoy Angles."
2,High pitched squeal,"Looks great- sounds awful. We put this head on, and we paid a LOT for it, and it's done nothing but squeal. We switched it out with a different head and the other brand works great. Do not recommend this one. Sorry"
4,Worth the watch!,"They were the best of psychos, they were the worst of psychos. Some holes in the story but, for the most part, a good movie about two slightly out of sorts young ladies."
5,I need low-sodium food.....,"I need low-sodium food, so I'm glad that Amazon carries this item which I include in my lunch every other day as a high protein treat. Amazons price is a lot lower than food retailers in this area are asking, so I save a lot of money. Having it shipped free is also a great incentive; thanks Amazon!"
4,Can Actually Taste the Herring!,"I used to buy a few brands that all I could taste was the salt. I came across these on sale earlier this month on Amazon and decided to give them a try. These taste amazing, and I love having them in salads. Certainly will stick to buying these unless a BPA free canned version is available, then I will purchase those :DShipping was very prompt, I think I got them within 3-4 days. Highly recommended, will be buying again!"
5,Best canned fish product,"This is the best canned fish product I have ever tried. Nice lightly smoked flavor, added salt is not missed, generous helping that fills the can, appetizing layout. Excellent! Minor complaint -- the pull tabs don't work on my batch (have to use a can opener) -- presumably this will be corrected shortly (my other Crown Prince product pull-tab cans are OK)."
4,Very Good,"There was some writting in the first chapter, in pencil, but that was it. Otherwise the book was in very good, almost new, condition. Thank you."
5,I have masterded this!,I have passed off EVERYTHING!Ever skill level with every guy I have everyone I have never gotten under s.econd
4,I like it.,"I got this little guy as something to use when I go to the gym. I have a 30gb ipod as well, but that's not really something to be moving around and working out with. I chose this player becuase it was affordable and had an FM tuner. I like the fact that you can just drag and drop your files to it. If you decide you don't want a song on it anymore, just drag it away. Voila! It also the shuffle option, which was the big thing with the ipod shuffle. Let me tell you, I have tried my friend's shuffle and, to put it nicely, it sucks. Big time. No screen or anything. Yuck. Anyways, some people have reviewed this and said that it breaks easily and quits working and such. I bought this back in November at Wal-Mart and have used it four to six times a week for a half hour each time and it is still working great. If you need something to take to the gym or on workouts, get it! It's worth it! The only thing that I would do is get some alternate headphones."
5,Great little player,"This is my second of the same model (my fault, got some water in the on/off switch). Have recently gotten 3rd and 4th for my wife and daughter. Use it daily for audiobooks. Works like a charm. Best features are 1) never had to install software, just used Windows Explorer to drag and drop, and 2) NO EXTRA CABLE TO CONNECT TO PC !!!"
1,Buyer beware,"I hope this product works fine with a PC: I wouldn't know, because I own a Mac, with which this product does not work. It would've been nice had the ""Product Description"" specified that; as it was, it made a disappointing Christmas gift for my girlfriend (who also owns a Mac) (and who is now very happy with her new iPod shuffle).A pity, because the MuVo seemed to pack so many more features into a similar size, and at a lower price. Oh well. We're waiting to see how the return to Amazon works; watch this space.Adding a note here after receiving a refund for the whole amount, less ""shipping credit"" ofabout a dollar. The refund worked fine, and it took about 2 weeks."
2,Volume Control ??,"The sound even at max volume doesnt sound loud or rich, compared to an iriver which I had returned for other reasons. I tried fiddling with the equalizer to no avail. the sound is clean though.why is the volume so low? worse, it varies across songs. the provided earbuds are awful for running.if someone has a suggestion for fixes, please suggest here."
5,Creatively in Love,"When I got this I had some issues with my PC, but when I called customer service they were extremely helpful. This is the little machine that could, I absoulutely love it! It has all the features I wanted and it is so easy to place files on it. It is so light it feels like I have nothing on, Radio has good reception and as soon as the weather breaks I cannot wait to get outside and run with it. The one suggestion I have is to go for the larger storage. I just wanted to take it for a test drive, but I am now hooked on Creative Labs. I will definetely be upgrading this one."
2,"Great little player, disappointing longterm performance","I bought this as a Christmas gift for my son in 2004. He loved it. It met all his requirements and worked great, until now, 6 months later. Problems began when the headphone jack only worked when twisted in one position. Now the player doesn't turn on. It still works as a USB drive, but only when tilted in the slot! It seems to be an internal connection problem. Very frustrating and much too soon to be happening.No useful help to be found on the manufacturer website. 90 day warranty is not sufficient -- maybe that's a red light?"
4,Great Text Book,"After reading this book, I felt that the author wrote a wonderful text book in a rational ways. It was not in the logical ways. The author stated the basis steps on page 6 and they are following.1. Establish your need or desire.2. Compose your spell.3. Shift consciousness.4. Raise energy.....5. Manifestation.It took for a while for finding this book is not following the above steps. It appears that chapter titles and subtitles are well organized as the text book but I found out it was not. I feel that the author spent so much time and energy for creating this book. So that I expected to get the author's thinking and speculation of what is time which might be the other form of energy? I did not get the answer from this book.Unfortunately, the use of fancy font for chapter titles are distracting for me.Morrie"
5,Very informative,"This book provides very comprehensive information about spell-crafting and energy work. The author's writing style is clear, easy to understand, personable, and knowledgeable. This is not a spell-book with pages of spells you can blindly implement, but rather an informative look at the hows and whys of spell-craft and energy work. Definitely a keeper."
3,I didn't like it as well as some others she has done,It was mailed quickly. I personally didn't enjoy this CD as much as I have her others. Very good price at Amazon though.
2,useless..boring examples...,i have bought this book about 1 year ago.i don't like this book. the example is too simple and boring.I recommended Mastering maya3 for beginner.
3,small,"Very cute and our daughter loves it, but beware of it's size. We were not aware that it would be so small. It is only about the size of your hand. Even our daughter commented on it, but she thinks it is cute anyway."
3,Why the constant price change???,I just ordered this plush for my two year old as he just loves Blue. I haven't received the item yet but am very frustrated that Amazon keeps changing the price. I paid close to $9 for this item on Amazon about a week ago and now it is down to $4.99. I know we are not talking about a lot of money here but why does the price keep changing? I'm sure my son will love this but an giving it a 3 star review because of the price change.
3,owen's blues,purchased this for 18 month old grandson--blues clues is the only tv show he will watch and he carries this around with him.
2,Great watch if it worked.,"This is a gorgeous watch. I live in a small community and don't have access to a large selection watches in stores. Amazon is a great resource for me, and I usually am really pleased with the products and service from them. This watch was an exception.I actually ordered this item twice. The first watch had a dead battery because the watch had been allowed to run while in the box. I returned it and asked for a replacement, communicating that the item needed to be checked for a functioning battery.The second watch arrived promptly, but it also had a dead battery. Even if I'd been willing to replace the battery (a cost I wasn't willing to shoulder), the instructions with the watch cautioned the owner not to let a dead battery remain in the watch as it may leak and damage the watch.Again, I'm normally really pleased with Amazon. This is a beautiful watch, but what good are looks if it doesn't function?"
2,Beware of dead battery,"Just as per a previous reviewer, the watch arrived with a dead battery. As it was shipped half way across the globe, I had to replace the battery since the shipping back would probably have been more expensive. The watch is nice, but Amazon seems to have an old batch. Bear this in mind when deciding to purchase it."
5,Love abounds,This is an excellent and comprehensive anthology that features poets normally excluded from compilations of love poetry.
1,bad Product,"I have no problem with the book, But this product is of extreamly poor quality! There are over 20 missing pages and some of those are the ending of the book!! I am trying to write a paper on this novel and critical points in the story are missing. NOT Helpful. Amazon needs to check on this source."
2,In that 10% that did not work,"I have a condo unit where almost annually there's a bad hair clog on the shower drains. I was perusing through reviews and even the youtube videos on how well it would work and decided to give it a go. The drain king did expand and vibrate the pipes. But after 15-20 minutes, the shower was beginning to overflow and the clog did not go away. I thought I placed the drain king incorrectly and adjusted it so that it was verticle with the drain pipe but still within the drain as instructed. Reran drain king for 10 more minutes and no change on clearing the clog. Apparently I'm in that 10% of cases that Drain King will not work according to their 90% success rate. So in my case I'm looking for a plumber willing to snake it to resolve this."
3,What about a look inside?,"I think I'd like to buy this book, but my critical thinking tells me no. At $37, I'd like to at least see a table of contents and a few excerpts. I suggest that you provide a ""Look Inside"" or drastically reduce the price."
2,Works... for a while... poor materials,"We own a Canon ip6700D, and we bought this adapter because our cameras use XD cards.The main problem with this adapter is that the plastic is very soft, and the 50 pins which enter the tiny holes will tear into the plastic if they don't enter perfectly into it. After a couple of uses, the pins will scrape plastic into the holes of the adapter. Clogging them with plastic.I'm not sure if any other XD-CF adapters are better, but we are currently making use of the 2-year warranty on this adapter to get a refund."
1,NOT COMPATIBLE WITH EPSON P-3000,"the xD card fit without any clearance problems. However, it did not work with any xD card to adapt to my P3000. Tech department at Delkin admitted that this was a problem they were unable to solve. Sony MS to CF adaptor works fine."
5,Response to Belle Epoque review...,"Of course it's not the old Enigma ""stuff"". There is no old Enigma ""stuff"". You have to be a fan of Michael Cretu and his production style to appreciate this recording. Yes, it is not similar to Enigma, but it is great. His work on wife Sandra's albums is fantastic. Her ""Close to Seven"" album is quite Enigma-esque. He also has produced the group Hubert Kah, French singer Syvlie Vartan, Peter Schilling's ""Different Story"", German group's Inker and Hamilton & Avenue, and so on. Fans of Cretu and Sandra should check out Sarah Brightman's ""Dive and ""Fly"" albums produced by Frank Petersen. He co-produced Sandra's ""Paintings in Yellow"". Armand Volker is one of Cretu sidekicks from the 80's. He has produced great albums for Maggie Reilly (Mike Oldfield's vocalist), Sally Oldfield, Hubert Kah, Munchener Freiheit, Bonnie Bianco. Good Stuff."
5,Quality Over Quantity,"This is a wonderful cd, yet is only 37 minutes long. Too short for such music, but none the less is worth the money.Each song is different. I can't say I like one better than the other. Waterfall and Snowing Under My Skin are the two slow tracks, but are beautiful. The rest are very upbeat. I love them all! BUY THIS CD!!"
1,This CD is not exactly the old ENIGMA,I bought this CD. This is not the old ENIGMA stuff. This CD sounds like Modern Talking tweaked out. Water Fall from this CD is a bit enjoyable but over this CD is not worth anything...
3,For Perspective and/or Novice Chin Owners Only,"This is a pretty good book if you're just starting your research on chinchillas, or if you're getting to know your new friend. It has some basic information and provides a general overview. However, due to the date that the book was published (1987), there is a lot of information that is outdated or incomplete. There are many other more recent resources that provide more thorough information."
4,Not long enough!,"This video is 23 minutes long and uses a fitness ball and a medicine ball to work your core muscles. I just started using the fitness ball, but I could follow rather easily, even though there is a limited amount of instruction on how to use the ball. None of the moves are very complicated and Pam explains how you can adjust them to your abilities. I think this is a great ab workout video to use when you don't have much time, or to use in conjunction with a cardio workout since it does not really get your heart rate up. My only complaint is that it is too short! At the end of the video it seemed like we had just started and I was left wanting more to do."
5,Double the Suspense,"How would you like to have to perform your own autopsy? That is the conundrum that faces Dr. Maura Isles in Body Double when she returns from a conference in France to find that the identical twin she never knew she had has been murdered in front of her house. The investigation into the murder leads Maura to a mental institution to confront the woman who gave the identical twins up for adoption 40 years before, and also leads Maura into the chilling discovery that a serial killer has been murderng pregnant women.This book moves quickly as Maura follows the investigation to its very surprising conclusion. It's a pleasure to see Maura team up with Dr. Jane Rizzoli-- Maura seems to take some of the hard edges off of Jane and Jane seems to make Maura a little less of an ice princess. This is an enjoyable book that you will find is hard to put down until the end."
3,Not up to her usual standards,"I have been one of Tess's biggest advocates among by friends and co-workers since her 1st book but I'm not that excited by this one. Maybe if you've never read a Patricia Cornwell book this would seem exciting and new.While the book does have some interesting twists, you'll reflect upon it and realize that the plot is too contrived (i.e., would the lawyer have really given up the goods that easy if he was still involved?) and other plot ""twists"" I saw coming a mile away.If you are a fan of the character and the author, you won't be wasting your time. Just don't expect the same level of intensity and plot you've come to know."
4,Took a while to get into this one,"I love Tess Gerritsen's books, but I did find this one a little difficult to get into. The first half of the book had me slightly frustrated and wondering exactly where it was headed. It was the second half of the book that really caught my attention and grabbed a hold of me. In fact I read the last 150 pages in one sitting. It's only for that reason that I give the book four stars instead of five. If you can be patient and let the book unfold, you'll find it a pretty satisfying read."
4,Symphony No. 4 / Requiem,"Two large scale Schnittke works featuring choir.The Symphony No. 4 is brittle, frequently dissonant and abstract, but not wholly inaccessible; not a piece to immediately grab at a listener. While demanding, the work has sections of alien beauty, such as before and after the entrance of ""Ave Maria"". Unfortunately the entire piece is relegated to a single track on the CD.The Requiem is more immediately approachable. Eerie and gothic, I'm surprised that it hasn't shown up in a soundtrack. The rock drumming near the end seems a little shocking but is surprisingly effective without seeming a pandering fusion piece."
2,Not a Great Value,"Compared to the original leather case with a magnetic latch on the flap, this Nylon camera is pretty cheesy. The original case also had internal pockets for a spare battery and a spare memory card. Skip this cheap case & get the leather one."
4,Excellent Primer for a Newbee,Very good book for a novice woodworker. I find that I go to the book on many occasions for reference. Instructions on how to accomplish a task are good. Good book for someone just starting out.
5,great book -- learned a lot,this is a good book where i learned a lot of basic box making techniques and then branched off of from there.
1,Nonexistent target audience,"I really doubt many people who are interested in a beginners book on box-making already own a table saw, bandsaw, miter saw, drill press router and power planer. But David Freeman expects the beginner box-maker to own all of those machines. That's a start up cost of what? Two thousand dollars to make your first box? He gives no information whatsoever on hand tool techniques. This pretty much exemplifies what's wrong with most contemporary woodworking books.Believe it or not, beatific boxes can be made entirely with inexpensive hand tools, and were made that way for a long time. Native American craftspeople of the Pacific Northwest made cedar bent-wood boxes without any metal tools.Conclusion: this book is useless. Beginners will not have access to the equipment; people with the equipment will already be familiar with the woodworking fundamentals covered here."
5,Finally....a down to earth Reiki guide,Excellent book on Reiki. I just purchased in last week and have already recommended it to several clients of mine...a few of them western medical doctors. It demystifies the subject in a language anyone can follow and more importantly it will not turn off the most closed-minded reader.
4,Book review,"I haven't had a chance to read more than excerpts of the book, but I am liking the information.Thanks for a great book."
1,tinny,cake sticks even with baking spray and it does not produce the shape correctly. Size was so small that abox cake mix almost overflows. Product was cheaply made and not worth the purchase price
3,Haven't heard it.,"I haven't heard this CD yet so I can't say how good it is (but the form made me pick something). But I have seen the band live at the Pound in S.F. a couple of years ago and I can't think of a tighter, more original band that I've ever seen (or heard from their other CDs I do have)."
2,Not a classic Salsa dance style,"I would not recommend this DVD for Salsa dance beginners who are used to the classic 123-567 lesson style. This DVD is only good for general Latin dance styles, not Salsa specific!"
3,Interesting Salsa,I think the tape is adequate. It gives the elementary step information. I think the part teaching the turns is very good.
5,Lots of Energy,"Let's Dance Salsa is the best DVD for learning salsa dance that I have ever seen. Marlon Silva has lots of energy, which really comes across on-screen. Easy to follow steps and tons of fun. I highly recommend this DVD!"
1,Expensive comedy...,"...I've loved watching Marlon and Susie many times on the internet for a cheap laugh. They are a testament to the fact that ""there is a fool born every minute"", and ""you can fool SOME of the people ALL of the time""... :^) ...And that if you just act serious, confident and as if you know what you are doing, you can sell people any kind of trash you want!!!In real life, as someone who lives and breathes Salsa, and has seen a lot of instructors, i know that this couple is a joke! If you start dancing Salsa this way in any Latin club i've visited anywhere in the world, you will be laughed out of it! No self-respecting woman who knows how to dance any style of Salsa - classic, modern, or ballroom - will subject herself to the nonsense that Marlon teaches. You will look like a fool in any Salsa setting...I love Marlon and Susie because they are the best Salsa clowns. However, buy this only if you have money to burn on a JOKE! :^)"
5,Amazing!,"Strong Stuff is perfect for health care professionals, agencies which run parenting groups, Women's Studies departments and mothers. It is not a sentimental book about mothering, but instead a series of honest, raw and revealing portraits of mothers. It is fascinating to read between the lines--to understand why each story is so important. The women in the stories have different backgrounds, experiences and mothers of their own which all play a part in their identity and success as a mother. The reader can't help but develop enormous respect for all mothers and for what the mothering process teaches them. Strong Stuff will change or broaden your perspective. And just try to put it down! I described it to a friend and she said, ""Amazing!"""
4,Intimate Ensemble Performance,"These are both very lovely, intimate performaces of these works, emphasizing very integral work of the soloists for the total effect. If you have listened to many performances of Haydn Masses, you will probably know what opposite take on the works sounds like. Big, triumphal and quasi-militaristic. I don't say that as a criticism of those readings because the works fit very well with such a style. But here is a proof that something different can be done, and the result not be twee and fussy. One little detail is that the organ and organist in the Salve Regina are very effective. It really brings out a vigor, almost like a counterpoint, but not exactly that, which I had not heard before in the work."
3,"Book of Rejection, Leslie Spit Treeo","What can you say about the LST, an eclectic band from Canada. I found a single promo CD of Angel from Montgomery in a bargin bin. Thats what started me trying to find copies of LST CD's. The lead singer has a great gravely voice. When she is allowed to fly its great. Be warned Angel from Montgomery is not on this CD. It's a good CD, no major mega hits on it. But it is worth a listen. If you can buy it cheap and you like eclectic, buy it."
2,"Love Bobby Jones, not the movie","Being an Atlanta native, I grew up with the legend of Bobby Jones. It's a shame that the movie did not match his standards for quality in his golf and his life. It is slow and plodding, the acting stiff and the scenes awkwardly staged not very natural. Instead of feeling you were in 1920, you constantly sensed that it was shot today trying to imitate 1920. James Caviezel was actually pretty good, but the movie as a whole just had an amateurish production quality. Bobby Jones was a great person, more so than a great golfer. The movie tried to show this, I just wish it could have been done more professionally."
1,Use at your own risk if you have high blood pressure,"I have moderately high blood pressure that is managed with prescription medication.I bought this product because I need to reduce inflammation and turmeric is known to be beneficial for cardiovascular health, even potentially lowering blood pressure. I took 2 caplets as directed; within an hour my blood pressure shot up to 188/106! It has NEVER in my life been that high. PLEASE, if you have HBP, get your doctor's OK first before using this product (admittedly, as I should have done.)"
2,Terrible scent,"I haven't even tried this yet, since I can't get past the scent. Terrible. Will eventually try it but am in no hurry at all."
5,Great Shave Stick,"When I travel I use a shave stick and travel brush to make shaving lather. Based on some comments on [...], a forum that deals with shaving among other things, I bought this shave stick - and I am glad I did.The first time I tried it I rubbed some of the soap onto my beard and dipped my shaving brush in warm water and made a great lather. The aroma has a light almond scent to it. The shave was great. I was able to do a four pass shave with just this one application. The product results in a slick, rich lather.I would recommend this product to everyone."
5,Magic for Children of Any Age,"I purchased this book for my 6-year-old niece, and almost didn't pass it along to her—I fell in love with the art and story within and nearly held onto it for myself! Wendy and Brian Froud create such exquisite work, and this is definitely a piece for any collector of all things faerie."
2,Use this with a heat gun or chemicals,"We are in the process of renovating a Victorian style home built in 1916 with several layers of paint. The siding is solid wood, clapboard pattern.This tool does not work well used directly on old, hard paint layers. It is unable to ""cut through"" the old layers of paint and reveal the wood underneath. The blade itself dulls rapidly. The profile is close to the pattern on our clapboard but since we did NOT want to use chemicals or a heat gun to soften the old paint it quickly became evident it would not do the job.So, if you are looking for a tool that can remove old paint without using chemicals or a heat gun buy the Bahco scraper. It has a replaceable carbide blade and is well designed, do not buy this one..."
5,The Biz-OMB,"Roots reggar nuff repect- max to the mind! Humble African blew me away- It is among the best 5 reggae songs Ive ever heard in the last few years. Haunting, inspiring, nuff words nah respect da Culture! 5 stars!!!!!"
5,BBC ACHIEVES EXCELLENCE!!!,"This incredible set is perfect for the whole family. narrator, David Attenborough does a brilliant job educating all on the wonders caught here in BLUE PLANET. The cinematography is astounding; crystal clear!!! I watch this all the time. The music is incredible...i even bought the soundtrack for the road!If you are an ocean life enthusiest, this set is a must have. I am a critic, and this impressed me to no end. footage is to die for!!!"
4,blue planet is awesome,"the first time i saw blue planet on tv i thought it was all computer images. It was the most amazing thing i had seen and i had to buy it, and i absolutely love it! Well worth the purchase!"
5,Better than Planet Earth.,"If you lack attention span and only want to look at pretty images and don't care about anything about the actually ecology than yeah watch Planet Earth, since its the most dumped down documentary ever made. (Sorry if I just offended you.) I wouldn't say The Blue Planet series is perfect since it covers so much species so Attenborough can't go into much details about each individual species. However, the delivery style is much better than Planet Earth, it retains a good balance between interesting information and doesn't try hard to bombard viewers with cheesy, grandiose shots and time lapses,My only dislike is this series also suffered from bad transitioning, like Planet Earth, one scene jumped to the next without correlation. However, it generally has good pace and should be much more interesting to watch, it has a calmer delivery style.I could be wrong, but a few scenes from this documentary is rehash in Planet Earth. It would be nice if BBC re-release this series in HD."
4,Blue Planet: Seas of Life,Completely satisfied with purchase. Enjoy the series and it is great to have it on disk. Highly recomended for nature lovers.
3,Was expecting more...,"I guess I purchased some items in the wrong order. I saw the Planet Earth series and was ASTOUNDED by the images and insight into our world. Because my studies as a Fisheries student centered around water, I thought that the Blue Planet series would be ""on par"" with the other series. Disappointment soon followed. This would be a great series for adolescents or the (not to sound cocky by any means) less educated."
3,Awesome Documentary - Poor Quality DVD,The content is brilliant and really informative. Although the quality of the picture could be a lot better.
4,What you want to see,"Have you ever rented a nature documentary to see something and then you watch grainy footage for about 2 minutes out of a 45 minute documentary? The rest of the time is talking heads or illustrations, right? This program is completely the opposite. It's all jaw-dropping, stunning stuff moment after moment. I walked away from The Deep Episode feeling privileged that I had the chance to see these unbelievable animals. Much of it was so incredible that it was more like watching a science fiction movie than a nature show. Equally, watching a pod of eight killer whales drowning a grey whale was some of the most gripping footage I have ever seen. The only drawback was that some episodes seem to lack direction but on the whole I was spellbound. Highly recommended."
5,Blue Planet: Seas of Life,"The 5-disc Special Edition of Blue Planet: Seas of Life is the perfect compliment to the newer Planet Earth series. It is worthwhile to buy them in a boxed set together, if possible. I bought Planet Earth originally, and then realized that Blue Planet was previous filmed by the same crew. Sir Richard Attenborough also narrates both series. My only regret is that it would have been cheaper to buy them as a set together instead of individually. The cinematography is incredible, the narrating is full of personality and interesting facts, and the series covers an astounding amount of information in each episode. I highly recommend Blue Planet as either a starter or a compliment to Planet Earth, and I definitely recommend getting them both."
3,SO-SO,I think that this book provided me with great knowledge about African American music in the early years. It went into great depth and was easy to read. Great for research papers.
1,the score,"this movie was good BUT"""" they did the dumbest thing i have ever seen. they went to all the trouble of making it suspencful until the end then they really messed up.tward the end of the movie ed norton grabs danny the head janitor and he should of knocked hem out or killed him because now he can identify him.how stupid can you be??'"
2,The Score-improvisation,"Great cast (why I wanted to watch it) but I felt it was not scripted: Marlon,Robert and Edward (who was main reason I ordered the disc) seemed to be making it up as they went along. Loved Montreal, but it did not make up for lean and lacking script and clear characters. Norton was on the fringe (wasted) and Marlon (huge and lisping-looking healthy, though) seemed to be wasted here. De Niro is as usual busy and masterful but I found I was easily distracted and not paying great attention to this movie.Was there a script or did Oz depend on actors to carry the dialogue and story along? VERY DISAPPOINTING."
1,DON'T BUY FROM OVERSTOCK_DEALS,"The DVD I ordered, The Score, was not in the sealed package. Instead, a Kung Fu title called ""The kid with Golden ARms' was in the package. I don't usually watch movies immediately when I receive them, as I try to build a collection of films I've enjoyed in the past. There is no recourse with the seller as too much time has passed."
1,Don't waste your money,I ordered a sno-stuff windshield for my 440 bearcat. This pile of junk did not last 100 miles. Cracked in several places and it was never rolled and I never ran into anything.
3,A wonderful book in a terrible edition,"I would agree with the commentators below in that Burke is by far the greatest politican ever, and that Reflections is not to be missed. However, of the several editions of this book I have read, this is undoubtedly among the worst. None of Burke's french footnotes are translated. Several quotations are untraced. The introduction is too long and unintelligent. The view it provides of Burke is not particularly accurate. The picture chosen for the cover ought to tell us what to expect from this edition, and the hopes we have are not disappointed. I recommend, for anyone who really wants to read this wonderful book, the Everyman edition, which is better on all of these counts."
2,completely out of touch with the real world of kid's minds,"This text bases the designing of curriculum on knowledge derived by a brainstorming event by the designer of a proposed course. The results of the brainstorming are then polished and refined until they become intended learning outcomes for students. Posner,et al. should realize brain storming can also lead to pooled stupidity- not what students need in the classroom. Instead of this book get ""Understanding by Design"" (Grant Wiggens and Jay McTighe- more recent and much more in sync with the world"
1,Difficult to Read,"This book is organized really well, and provides a ""map"" at the beginning of each chapter as a visual for what the chapter discusses. However, font is really small, and the text is very ""wordy."" It is difficult to read and remember what they're talking about. It provides step by step instructions for designing a course, but each step is WAY to long. Would NOT recommend."
5,twilight5173,I love DEF LEPPARD. This CD does not dissapoint. I have rocked going down the road and been happy as a clam. Wonderful compilation of the best songs good sound I am very pleased.
5,No more stained clothes!,"I love this smock! My son is 16 months old and quite a messy eater. When we feed him anything messy, he usually rubs it all over his shirt. This smock protects his clothes completely. It tucks in under the highchair tray so it even covers his pants. Now we can feed him anything without having to change his clothes first or worry about stains. It also covers the highchair seat so we don't have to clean that as often either! It is easy to put on and take off, my son doesn't mind wearing it at all, and it's very easy to clean with a damp cloth. You can throw it in the washer too but we haven't had to yet. It works great for art projects too. Now that I have this, I don't know how I lived without it!"
2,Inaccurate information -- not reliable,"This book was profiled on the Today Show during World Breastfeeding Week and an excerpt was found at msnbc.com.Dr. Natterson appears to mean well, but her information is inaccurate and her tone is often misleading. She identifies problems and fails to identify solutions. She has made several factual errors.There are numerous solid reliable baby care handbooks available that do not suffer from these problems. I recommend consulting one of those. (The Baby Book by Sears, The AAP Guide, etc.)"
1,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,"THIS BOOK APPEARED TO BE WRITTEN IN THE EARLY 1900'S. THE ILLUSTRATIONS WERE SMALL, OR POOR QUALITY, AND IN BLACK AND WHITE. NOT A SINGLE COLOR PHOTO! COMPREHENSIVE INSTRUCTIONS ON SOIL PREPARATION, I.E.LEVELING THE SOIL ETC. VERY LITTLE ON ANUALS, COLOR, BALANCE, OR ANYTHING ESTHEITCALLY PLEASING. THIS BOOK WAS A CHORE TO LOOK THROUGH."
5,Everyone should watch this video,"This video presents the concept of life after death in a logical, no-nonsense way. I never got any feeling that any of this is fictional. When I was done watching it, I felt great peace. One thing I especially like is that it addresses the skeptics' view that these experiences are simply a matter of our brains shutting down. The people in the video are real, their stories are real, and it's all presented in a simple but professional manner. I don't know how someone could not be convinced of this reality after watching this video."
2,A boring Disney movie with bats,"The two main characrters are a male and a female who meet in the middle of the book, there's the bad guy with his clumsy sidekick, and their evil plan backfires at the end. What could be more unoriginal?PS. The reason I gave it two stars instead of one is because it's about bats, who aren't usualy the heros."
3,get inside the mind of a bat in this standard adventure,"Shade is a young sliverwing bat. He wants to see the sun, something forbidden to bats by ancient animal law. He gets separated from his colony during their winter migration and meets another bat who tries to help him find his colony while evading canabalistic jungle bats intent on stirring up warfare among birds, animals, and bats. For any bat lovers or bat-fearers this is an unconventional look into the life of bats, one that makes you want to take a second look at the furry little creatures...Otherwise, it's fairly standard fantasy adventure."
4,"Good, some problems, but still good","This is a nice piece of equipment. Although it is unlocked and you can easily install your sim into it and start using it, mine had a little problem. The place where the sim card goes was not making contact with the sim, preventing the phone from working. However I had to make some personal adjustments and it is now working. As some other users mention, the phone tends to freeze for a while. I consider that the memory size is very limited given the current memories you can find in the market. All the other features are working fine. The screen resolution is fine and the camera is average for a phone (if you need resolution, buy a camera, not a phone!!) Cell phone cameras are not for photographers, are for fun clips. This is a good choice if you need a compact equipment in which you can have 3 in 1. PDA, Cell phone and music player."
1,If only I could hear !,"The phone has the worst earpiece volume of all the phones I know.You would have to use the speakerphone in order to keep a conversation. Bad, really bad phone."
2,Slow to the point of irritating,I really wanted this phone to work for me given its price/features. However the slow processor really gets to you. It frequently freezes up and gets significantly slower the moment any other app other than the defaults are installed.
1,I am really disapointed with Amazon....,"Last week this product cost $234.00 usd, now it is almost a hundred usd more expensive, check it somewhere else..."
2,poor quality,"probably half the tablets in 2 of 5 bottles opened thus far of NOW L-Arginine were disintegrating - with the outer cover of the tablet separated from the ingredients bound by the cover. Good price advertised for the product, but given the tablets'inferior quality, more expensive than the higher priced alternative"
3,Not worthy of Stephen Brust,"This book is set in the Dragaeran world that Vlad Taltos moves in; the same setting as in ""Jhereg"", ""Taltos"", ""Orca"", ""Phoenix"", ""Teckla"", ""Athyra"", have I missed any?All of which books I loved. But this is a slightly strained attempt toparody ""The Three Musketeers"" by Alexander Dumas, an old favorite of mine.Well, I don't think it worked. Brust's characters act far more outrageously thanthe originals, and I think the attempt to bend the story to match the original tooclosely ruined its believability. It doesn't quite work.Still, it is a well-written piece, and an ambitious attempt"
1,Struggled to get thru this!!,"""I would like to review this book."" ""How, you would like to review this book?"" ""Yes, I would."" ""Then, I await for your review."" ""I will do so."" ""I am eager to hear it."" ""As I am eager to tell."" AAAAGGGHHH.....GET ON WITH IT ALREADY! I could have read this book in half the time by taking out the unimportant dialog and unneccesary descriptions...especially when told they weren't important! This will be this first book that I have ever returned!"
5,Wry and witty,I enjoyed this book so much that I read The Three Musketeers. The characters are shown to be complex individuals and the background for the story an important one in the history of the Dragaeran empire. Don't start the series from here or you'll get lost. A great read from a master storyteller.
3,"Not bad, not great.","Absolutely have no problem with the seller. The book arrived in good condition and quite quickly. The book itself is well organized and nicely written. However, some subjects are covered a bit too cursorily without enough explanations regarding program flow in some cases. I could easily see how, in some circumstances, a beginner could become confused when trying to decipher programming examples. And this becomes noticeable among the more complex subjects. Nevertheless, for a good part of the book this is not a problem, but seems to pop up at crucial times.This is a good book on C programming, not a great book."
4,Excellent programming book,"Great book. Comprehensive and conversational. This covers a lot of reference-book-style material in a friendly and easy to understand style. The only drawback would be that it is slightly difficult to find material one is looking for from time to time as some of the material is relegated to a FAQ section behind each chapter. Other great general C programming books are C: A Reference Manual, Harbison and Steele, and Programming with GNU Software, Loukides and Oram."
2,Great pictures but issues with product,"This printer does print excellent pictures, but I've had it less than a year and had to send it in for cleaning already, which I had to pay the shipping. The utility that they used to clean it is impossible for the consumer to access, so you have to send it in.I've purchased two printing packs which were supposed to produce 80 pictures each. I only have 90 pictures to show for it. I'm waiting for Sony to resolve the situation.My husband bought it for me for Mother's Day, so I could print our baby's pictures easily. He might be sending it back asking for our money back."
1,POOR BUT INTERESTING,"I was most dissapointed by this book, it didn't do it's job according to the title anyway. Don't waste your time or money on this"
2,Antifungal Liquid for Toe Nails,I have been using this product for 2 months now applying it twice a day. My two nails with the fungus still have the fungus. I have to wait and see if further applications will work. Some say that you have to use it 3 o 6 months to see if it works. I will keep trying.
5,Great !,"Would like this series on American Television. These characters,even though solving crimes, are human,with the usual foibles and human problems"
2,This was pretty terrible,"Granted, I know this is not meant for someone in my age group (although I can't imagine anyone in any age group finding this entertaining), this movie was pretty awful, and this is coming from someone who enjoys the occasional ""Arthur"" episode. Still, I cannot get behind this movie. It was rather stupid and so for anyone in their 20s who thinks that he/she might be reliving the good ol' days by watching this movie, I can assure you that you will not. Not only that, but how you base the majority of the plot of a 60 minute film on the mistaken beliefs of some illiterate animals is beyond me. I found myself pausing this movie several times to regrow my brain cells, so it actually took me something like 5 hours to get through."
3,A Pretty Bland Comeback!!!,"I love 'The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh' but Winnie's return was kinda weak for me. This movie had the spirit, but not the soul of the original. It had a few cute scenes and I loved Zooey Deschanel's version of Winnie's theme. Zooey has such a beautiful singing voice! I didn't like Christopher Robin's voice, he sounded too childish. Throughout the movie, Pooh and his pals help find a tail for Eeyore, search for honey, and rescue Christopher from a fake monster believed to be called the 'Backson' because they couldn't read his note in saying that he'd be back soon. If you love the original, you might enjoy WINNIE THE POOH!!!"
5,love it,I bought this movie for my toddler and she loved it. She loves the characters and the quality of the movie is great
5,"great, truly family/kid movie!","Non violent, sweet, and lovely full length feature. More studios should follow this platform. This is precisely the kind of movie kids should watch!"
5,Pooh Review,Very good. Three year old loved it. She interacted with it and wanted to watch it over again. Well worth while for the young ones.
1,Rip off,Winnie the Pooh is a wonderful children's movie and I was so looking forward to watching it with my kids. But the DVD freezes no matter which DVD player I try. And it always ends up completely stopping before the end. I'm throwing it out. Save your money and buy from someone who won't rip you off!
1,hmmm,"I tried playing this DVD in multiple DVD players and also my xbox 360, but it did not work in ANY of them."
3,"Well insulated, but could be an inch deeper","The UV Bulb is longer than the light fixture. It would have been better if the fixture was a little deeper by maybe an inch or two. I've seen deeper ones at the local pet shop, so I know they exist. The porcelain coating does seem to help insulate the heat. Otherwise, this is a step up from a cheap clamp lamp, and it does a good job."
5,"Fun game, we love it for all ages!","We have had a lot of fun with Coloretto, play with adults or kids. It is easy to understand and fast so you don't get bored with it."
4,"a fun, different kind of card game","It is a nice quick game that you don't have to strain your brain on. Yet it can tease your intelligence if you want it to. I bought two, one to keep and one to give as a gift."
1,Dreadful dreck,"I read this book sometime ago expecting and hoping to find some deeply philosophical and moving writing about life. Instead what I got was dreadful writing that never rises above the obviousness and triteness of ""fly fishing is a metaphor for life."" Try this one on for size: ""My father was very sure about certain matters pertaining to the universe. To him, all good things - trout as well as eternal salvation - came by grace; and grace comes by art; and art does not come easy."" Yuck. I can't even read that sentence and so many others in the book, without, um, metaphorically speaking, wanting to rinse it right out of my mouth. It's like rancid ice cream coated with honey and molasses and then sucked through a full pixie stick."
3,About the sample - not book itself,"This sample was VERY frustrating! It's all preface and acknowledgments. I have a student who wanted to read the sample before buying, and this gave nothing of the story."
5,"A majestic, poetic, spiritual voyage along his personal river!","Simply great writing from an extremely interesting man! Maclean writes poetically like an eloquent ancient orator, making the techniques of fly-fishing, descriptions of mountain grandeur, and the earthy side of rough, western towns blend together into a harmonious whole. The three stories of this book are extremely well crafted by a fine wordsmith. There is a natural spirituality that flows under his writing, yet he and his brother were simply tough kids. A classic read!"
5,Beautiful language,"I was invested almost immediately in the characters, Norman and Paul. The scene where Norman finds himself left in the rain, so to speak, found me laughing out loud. More than anything, I love the beautiful prose and storytelling. This is a book I read the first time more than twenty years ago and the most recent was this year. I've owned several copies because I loan them out and then purchase another. I finally loaded it on my Kindle so I will now always have a copy if I find myself in need of a Maclean fix. I recommend it to anyone. I love this story."
5,Wicked Edgar- the alternative to alternative music,"On their debut album, Wicked Edgar has managed to sucessfully meld melodic with metallic. The bands sharply rocking tunes have something for all tastes. From the sweeping ballad ""I will be there"" to the crushing guitars of ""Leave me alone"", the band never fails to impress. Led by the powerful vocals and furious guitar of John ""Fingers"" Compton, the equally crushing guitar of Jeff Hefner and the powerhouse rythmn section of Pat Smith and Fred Shaw often leave listeners wondering what is next. All in all an impressive freshman effort from a band to look out for."
1,Nothing like the book,"Marion Zimmer Bradley's Mists of Avalon is one of my all-time favorite books. I was so excited when I heard TNT was making a mini-series based on the book. I counted down the days and even through a party to celebrate the first night of the mini-series. And, from that first night on, I was terribly disappointed. The actresses do NOT capture the spirit of their characters. Angelica Huston's Viviane is cold and very nearly mean, so unlike Viviane in the book. The spirit and meaning of the book were completely lost in this mini-series. I would not recommend it to anyone. If you haven't read the book, READ IT! Don't watch this. And if you have read the book, don't watch this because you will be sorely disappointed. A pathetic re-telling of Marion Zimmer Bradley's masterpiece."
4,Great Companion to the Book,"Don't compare this movie to the book. Like all adaptions of books, the movie doesn't come close to the brilliance of Bradley's gem. However, the movie is a definite companion to the book. It really doesn't stray far from the plot or the personalities of the characters. This movie does the book justice.I did feel that Qwen should have been portrayed in a more nagging or religious obsessed manner but I loved Julianna Margulies as Morgaine (Clooney's gal from early ER episodes). The rest of the cast were amazing. The costumes and scenery were perfect. The beauty of avalon was captured brilliantly. You must watch this movie (although I reccommend reading the book first). The experience was nothing short of pure enjoyment"
2,Stick to the book!!!,"I should know by now that the movie verisions of my favorite books are typically a sorry disappointment --This is no exception. While I was pleasantly surprised at the Julianna Margulies' portrail of Morgaine (an actress I typically find forgetable); the actors for Lancelot, Guenevere, Aurthur and even Igraine were FAR from the rich, well-developed characters that I loved with, cried for and genuinely cared about in the novel. The adaptation took liberties in areas that were not necessary even within the time constrates of film - such as the variation on the character of Morgause and the exit of Viviane's character.If you think the movie sounds interesting- BUY THE BOOK!"
3,Could Have Been Better,"I rented The Mists of Avalon on DVD and I must say, it had a wonderful cast, beautiful imagery, and vivacious costumes, but the overall storyline lacked any charisma. I was very disappointed on how Mordred was protrayed as a purely evil human, bent out on the destruction of his own father. Surely, he must of had some conflict arising in him about his father becoming his enemy. Any thoughts or actions of human compassion coming from him, at least once, would have bettered the movie for myself. Also, I wasn't very pleased with the overall ""Happy Ending"" that took place towards the end which didn't lay true to the actual story. Don't butcher a good story, it doesn't do any justice to the author. All in all, it was a somewhat decent film but nothing spectacular."
4,Great! So long as you haven't read the book,"I saw the mini-series when it was on TNT back in the summer and immediately fell in love with the magical retelling of King Arthur. In fact, I was so intruiged, that at the end of Part I, I ran to my computer, bought the book online and ran back to the TV to watch part I again. When I got the book, it took me a year to finish, not because it was long, but because I misplaced it several times. The book is incredible! So I had to buy the DVD of the miniseries. The day I got it, I ripped it out of its box and watched it immediately... I was dissapointed by how much the story sways from the book. I know that all retellings are that way, but I was dissapointed. And though I think they managed to get the overall spirit of Ms. Bradley's work, I really would not say they caught much more than that. Character development and background could have been better, and I didn't like this Mordred, but that is a personal opinion."
2,a half good movie,The first half of the movie was great and followed the book pretty well. Unfortunately I realized that it had only covered about the first quarter of the book. Ted Turner obviously decided to solve the problem by completely changing the ending and thus the entire tone of the movie. If Bradley were alive I'm sure she'd be very disappointed in what was done to her book. The actors were not at fault and did a credible job but the writers should be hung. This should have been at least an eight to twelve part mini series not a three parter. It's a shame someone with a little more intelligence like Peter Jackson hadn't gotten the movie rights instead of Ted Turner. This man produces nothing but pablum. Bradley's book is every bit as great a novel as The Lord of the Rings and it deserved as good a treatment in the movie. That's what happens when an egomaniac decides he knows what's best. Proof positive that money can't buy you brains or good taste.
3,its ok...,"This movie isn't bad. That being said, it is hands down the worst butchering of a phenomenal book I have ever experienced. Now I know that things must be cut for the sake of time when adapting to the screen, however, the story barely resembled the idea of the book. Badly done, in my opinion. Other than that, not bad for a tv movie."
5,Michael Vartan,He's not on the cover but man he's fine. The very Foxy Michael Vaughn....I mean Vartan is my favorite Actor but the movie and book are wonderful.
1,Nothing But Heartbreak Here!,"Hate this movie! I only gave it a star for looks!Must be the dumbest concept I've ever seen! Why in the world Morgraine would even WANT to continue training to become a priestess or care anything about Avalon, Her aunt Vivian,or continue worshipping the Mother Goddess when only terrible things happen to everyone she loves! Really despicable,self-serving priestesses. Never got a single clue of ANYTHING good ever coming from their Mother Goddess worship and what's so special about Avalon anyway? Will never put this in a class with Excalibur! This is a totally perverted, and DEPRESSING version of the King Aurthur Legend, Don't waste your time unless you like DOWNERS!"
3,Not too shabby,"This movie didn't WOW me. The scenery looked like it was out of a fantastic dream. The acting was decent. The music was excellent, I love Loreena McKennitt. The plot was good. But let me give you some advice, don't watch this with the kiddie, oh no. Bad choice. If this movie was rated, I'm not sure it would make PG-13. Keep that in mind."
2,A disappointing outline of a rich story,"I doubt that anyone could have taken a 900+ page book and cut it down into a 2.5 hour movie without losing enormous chunks of the story and damaging the continuity. I had at least read the book, so knew roughly what was going on. My husband and daughter were frequently baffled.Although I found the book somewhat frustrating, particularly toward the end, it was nevertheless a richly imagined and intriguing story. I found the movie sad, as it hustled through what were considered the essential scenes. Too bad."
1,MZB must be turning over in her grave,"This was the worst adaptation of a novel, for television or the big screen, that I've ever had the misfortune to see. This is one of my favorite books ever written, and if I hadn't read it, I don't think I would have understood what was going on, because the miniseries bore little resemblance to the book. If you're a fan of King Arthur movies, see Excalibur, Merlin, or even Camelot. If you haven't read the book, I think at the very least you will be confused. If you HAVE read the book, you will want to throttle the screenwriter, director, and everyone else who had the unmitigated gall to think this Cliffs notes version of a miniseries would pass muster with true Marion Zimmer Bradley fans."
5,By the Book!!!,"As a HUGE fan of Marion Zimmer Bradley, who wrote the novel, when I saw the movie, I was just STUNNED at how well it stuck to the book. It was like watching my mind reading the book all over again.The movie (AND the novel, which you MUST read) portrays the factual, NOT fictional events that took place during the Era of the Christian, Anglo Saxon Crusades against the Druids, and other pagans of the land.Ms. Huston, who portrayed Vivienne, Lady of the Lake, was PHENOMENOL.As was the actress who portrayed Morgaine (Morgan, Morgan Le Fey, Morgana, and many other names she is known by in legend), the sister of King Arthur.The movie brilliantly weaves the story about the WOMEN behind the throne, and puts King Arthur, Merlin, and Lancelot in more or less supporting roles, albeit powerful ones as well.But the way this story is told, will leave you breathless.A MUST SEE."
2,Some copies seem to be defective,"I'd have given this four stars, because I enjoyed the atmosphere and costumes even though there are times the dialog and acting are jarringly modern. And things like, why are the Celts worshipping Diana instead of a Celtic goddess? But I can't render a final opinion because: I've received two defective DVDs in a row and have not been able to finish the film. Both DVDs have started off OK. But stop one for a short viewing break and my DVD player has never been able to read it again. My player is fairly new and plays all other DVDs just fine so . . . I think there is a problem with this run. Sure, I can get a refund, but it doesn't look like I'll ever finish the film."
1,The Sunflower that never blooms,"It is a beautiful mold, and I was excited to make a cake in the shape of a sunflower. I am a pretty experienced baker, and my success rate, even with tricky procedures, is very high. In five attempts to use this cake pan, each ime increasing how slavishly I greased and floured the alleged ""non stick"" surface, and being careful to remove it per the instructions - after cooling 10-15 minutes on a rack after removing from the oven, I never got it out in one piece. The mold's detailed corners are too sharp to cleanly release the cake. I even tried letting it fully cool in the hopes some shrinkage would help get the cake out. I own other Nordic Ware pans and have had better luck with them, but this particular mold is a loser, which was very disappointing considering how pretty it could potentially be if it worked. If you want to use it for Jello, I'm sure it's fine, but for cakes, it's a waste of time and money."
3,Good book for the newbie,"I'd purchased this book for a computer class & I have to say that I did like the book. I'll admit, it wasn't the most thrilling textbook I had to read, but it did list things pretty clearly.The beginning of the book had some pretty basic stuff, which I already knew but I suppose that there's people out there who are even more of a newbie than I am & didn't know some of that stuff.This is a good textbook, but I'm interested in seeing what the next edition has in comparison to this one."
1,STINKS,i ordered this product a week ago on super saver ship and took over a week for it to be shipped and once i got it and showered with it it stunk like glue really bad. it was $12 and the other one was $20 definitely should have spent the extra $8 for the other one this one does not smell good at all.
4,Give this man a budget,"Not as strong as his previous ""Black River Falls"", which was Coughlan's strongest work since 1985's ""The Clock Comes Down the Stairs"" with Microdisney, nevertheless this is a fine record, with Coughlan's voice sounding better than ever (if that were possible). The arrangements leave a little to be desired for me. I just wish that someone would have the decency to give this man a budget to record with, as he is certainly one of the most interesting artists at work today."
1,READ THE FINE PRINT TWICE & THEN AGAIN,on the front page of every Amazon cell phone you see an awesome price & a note that only 181 day committment is required BUT ALL THE PLANS THEY OFFER require a 2 yr committment NOT ONLY for phone service BUT THEY SNEAK IN A REQUIRED & MOST EXPENSIVE DATA PLAN $39.99 a month on each phone) AMAZON's WEBSITE & PRICING IS PURPOSELY DECEPTIVE. A disappointment and a waste of time.
5,Excellent book,"This book provides an excellent foundation for supporting Microsoft Windows 2000 Cluster Server. If your goal is to learn how to install, configure, customize, and troubleshoot Cluster Server this book is a must."
1,Not Worth My Library Late Fees,"A useless book (its stated purpose is to tell us that the Net+ certification will be in high demand, duh! )which has an error ridden sample test that does more harm than good. I left it discarded and forgotten under a pile of other books, until my local library reminded me that I should return it."
1,"Useless Book, Go To CompTIA website for Info","Unfortunately I bought this book (impulse buy) before referring to the Amazon reader review first. Previous reviewers pretty summed up what the book content is. The only thing of value in the book is the Exam Blueprint, an outline of what topics are covered on the Network+ exam. The review questions were not really useful in preparing for the test. I took the exam a few hours ago (68% to pass, scored a 92% no thanks to this book) and a *couple* review questions were almost verbatim on the actual exam. Don't waste your time with this book."
3,kinda slow...,"i was expecting something different... i thought it was something completely different then what it really is.gameplay: at first it's really annoying!!! but after like 10 hours you should get used to it.graphics: not the best... but good.music: more backround music then anything else...story: i thought the story was gonna be about an emperor protecting his empire, but no... it's about... well if you want to get it... i don't want to spoil it...replay value: very good actually.... i played a few parts 5 times... (because there's this stupid closed fist/open palm thingy... thank god there's an in-game save!) ... and it never glitched up.i don't know what game is like this one... it's interesting but if you want to have fun and not smack yourself for paying a ton of money for a game you probably won't like... i recommend getting something like BloodRayne, Tomb Raider, or Devil May Cry."
4,a good introductory book for middle eastern cuisine,"I like to experiment with different cuisines and felt ready to expand my middle-eastern repetoire beyond falafels, hummus, and pitas. This books certainly does that. There is a good selection of dishes from different countries and the introductory section on techniques (inclusing how to make yogurt and yogurt cheese) is good. I did find it a little repetitive,in the sense, that I *already* knew how to do those things. As an intermediate level cook most of the recipes are also a bit too easy.."
5,Interesting and Useful,"I checked this book out from my local library, and will be sad to return it this week. It was interesting to read through, to see some of the different customs associated with different recipes and regions. I also enjoyed learning how the same food (like falafel) differs from place to place. So far, I have only prepared one recipe, falafel Yemeni style, and they were delicious. The directions were clear and easy to follow."
5,"Fascinating, I couldn't put it down!!",Walter Lord's book has opened my eyes with factual information and well written yet little known trivia. I would like to thank Mr. Lord for his excellent and obviously well researched book.
4,"Nice read after you read ""A night to remember""","This is a follow-up on the original book ""A Night To Remember."" This goes into further detail about many of the witnesses and passengers who were on the ill fated Titanic. Most of this information is informative, interesting and for people who just can't get enough information on the ship and the night it sank. I only gave it 4 stars because some of the information I really could have done without. But I was able to buy this book on a Kindle Daily Deal for $1.99.Walter Lord, in my opinion, really is the leading (author) expert on the Titanic disaster. He has spent years gathering information, and laying it out piece by piece for the reader. Superb book, but first read ""A Night To Remember"" and if you want more information (behind the scene info), then this is a book you need to read."
4,Pretty Good.,"I love the book so far!But, I payed for a brand new book and when I got it, there was hair stuck to it in this sticky gunk.Luckily, I was able to wash it off."
4,Excellent item BUT,"This is an excellent item. But I still pound skirt steaks with a ""tenderizing"" mallet first. The combination make the steaks truly ""melt in your mouth"" tender. This cleans easily by just putting it, intact, into the dishwasher."
2,Some Annoying Details; I returned it,"Let's face it -- microwave technology's been around for a long time & all these things work the same, so it's the little details that make the difference. I bought this oven, but wound up returning it b/c:1. light doesn't go on when you open the door, which is just really weird & disconcerting.2. The buttons are actually kinda hard to push3. B/c of my kitchen, the only room for my mircowave is on top of the fridge, and from the ground, looking up, I could barely read the LCD display -- it had to do with the brightness & the angle.I wound up sticking with a Sharp which I like much better. Better design, better shortcut buttons, easy to read screen, bright & cheery."
2,"Died after 6th month, was just an OK model till then","Not pleased with this particular one... it had issues as other have mentioned, buttons hard to press, and no lightr when the door is opened.Died in 6th month... guess you get what you pay for !"
5,Pleasantly surprised!!!,"A couple of months ago, I attended a seminar taught by Lin & Larry called Confident Cruising. What a treat to meet this inspiring couple! I have offshore dreams myself and since I know I will be in charge of my own galley, I bought The Care & Feeding of Sailing Crew. I thought it would have a few recipes and hints on how to store food. Little did I know that the book is so much more: You travel with Lin & Larry on a 45 day passage from Japan to Canada and during the passage, Lin teaches you everything you need to know about provisioning, food care & storage, galley layout, cabin care - the list goes on and on. I haven't finished the book yet - I'm with them on day 30. They are eating mostly canned food now but Lin is still preparing great meals! I love Lin's style of writing - you really feel like she's talking to you over a cup of tea.BUY THIS BOOK! IT'S FANTASTIC!"
3,Throw Cathy from the train,"As much as I enjoyed Old Boys and Ghosts, I just couldn't get past the dreadful Cathy. Paul Christopher's first love age 16 (Rima)had character, brains and nerve. Christopher's choice of Cathy, a neurotic, rather stupid, slutty mess, simply doesn't ring true."
1,Same clicking noise,"I've had the exact same problem as Mr.Breen's. (with WD drives) I wouldn't buy this model, at least with WD drives."
1,Very disappointing,"I am a big fan of SMiLE, and bought this book to get the inside story. Unfortunately, I did not learn much I did not know already, and was subjected to endless ramblings about other stuff happening in the era. And this is very poorly written."
2,"Crosswords, yes, but NO Connection","Following on the heels of other mystery writers who run out of ideas before their publishers stop paying advances (Rita Mae Brown's Harry Haristeen series, for example), the husband and wife team of Nero Blanc have turned in a third episode in their series. The characters are okay, but most of the book is taken up with a nonsensical diversion that has nothing to do with the real murders and the actual solution comes out of left field, which to me is the cardinal sin of mysteries. If crosswords are your thing, I'd go for the first couple of books in the Puzzle Lady sequence by Parnell Hall, instead."
4,Good 'Nam Novel,"Captain Jim Harrison is back to Nam on his second tour, only this time he is the Ops Officer for Juliet Company, a newly formed LRP unit. Administratively they have to start from scratch. Not one to sit behind a desk, he goes out on various inserts, patrols and extractions. The firefights are good and the extractions under fire are hair-raising. A good look at what it takes to set up a LRP unit. He loves serving his men but his absence from his new wife really puts a strain on his marriage. Wounded when his chopper is hit with an RPG he gets evaced to Japan for recuperation before returning to combat. Good read about the feelings of the men and women, American and Vietnamese, during the late 1960s. Recommended."
4,A great set.,"This set my not have the greatest prints ever but it is all in all a very good set with great movies.Films on this DVD:(4.5/5) Metropolis(4/5) Nosferatu(3/5) Dr. Jeckyll and Mr HydeIt's a one DVD set with literally no features. Great buy if your not crazy over special features on a DVD and care more about the movies, like I do. This makes more sense to buy because Nosferatu and Metropolis purchased together on Amazon rings up to over $50. You can get this DVD for $4. A good buy for movie lovers. Great classics on this DVD. Well worth the money I spent on it, although it wasn't much. Highly recommended.4/5"
1,Don't waste your money!,"I purchased this book as an LPN student to prep for the NCLEX. I found the questions in this book too elementary and obvious-definitely not to RN standards! I didn't feel as if I was being challenged or learning any new information. There were multiple errors in the book. Overall, it was worthless. Does anyone else agree? I would recommend #1 Mosby's (CD is great!) #2 Kaplan."
1,It USED to be great,"I was really happy with this TV for a while. Now the screen has a severe yellow color that can't be adjusted out. It turns out that these TV's are part of a class-action lawsuit because the ""optical block"" goes bad. I am assuming the optical block is rather expensive, and I know for a fact it is not easy to get to.As I write this, the lawsuit is pending an appeal by Sony. They say they are honoring the term of the settlement, but because the process was dragged out for so long, the date for ""warranty extension"" has gone by.Straight from Sony's website: ""Sony denies the existence of a defect"". That tells me all I need to know about Sony."
5,Great Purchase,"I love this TV. I did my research, and found this TV to fit my needs exactly. Though it's only capable of displaying 1080p over HDMI, that's no big deal since quality HDMI cables are readily available - DO NOT BUY THE EXPENSIVE MONSTER ONES, any HDMI cable, because of the nature of the connection, will either be perfect, or broken... no quality variance. I've had nothing but good experiences with it since I received it. EGL shipping was excellent, though I chose to pick it up at the warehouse. It came fast, and much earlier than the approximated ship time. I couldn't be happier unless it was free, and because of Amazon's prices, I still got it for close to a thousand dollars cheaper than the Sony store, or any of the big box retailers like Best Buy."
2,Sound quality on inbound and outbound not great,"I was quite hopeful that this product would finally cut the cord from my headset and laptop while gaming but I find that folks complain that my voice is distant and tinny when used over services like ventrillo and I find the incoming sounds also distant.When using the stereo headset feature I find the degraded sound quality even more noticeable. If you are someone that wants to sit back and listen to music you will be disappointed, if you want to move around and listen to an audiobook it will probably be fine."
1,Call Jabra first! Don't trust their website compatibility tool! Call!!!,"I checked Jabra's compatability tool with my Sony Ericsson W300i cell/mp3 player, and was given the all clear, couldn't wait to get it! Paired up with no problems, but will only make and receive calls, no music!!! That was my main reason for buying it! So, I called Jabra and was told that no it would not be able to play music! I love my cell/mp3 player, it's a great phone, and Jabra made it sound like my phone was out of date which it is not at all. When I mentioned that their website tool said it would work I simply got a ""sorry"". So, make sure you call them or better yet go with your cell phones brand name headset, this has taught me a lesson!"
3,l wish louder version,"It's Ok for the price. Works with Dellx50v/ Razer3/ SE/ ..skips for second in few places (e.g. near NY PATH) but generally works fine in train, etc. Will shop for Lubix UBHS-LC1/Sonorix C3/.. something I could put on the belt/pocket/etc., view caller ID, can use in YMCA (in 620s it gets to hot) in all other ways it's good for ~30$ stereo BT"
1,Jabra BT620 Would Return If I Can,"If I could, I would return this product. I have a Nokia 5300 phone, and it really doesn't work with this headset. When listening to the mp3 player, the music has a lot of pauses. When talking to someone on the phone, there's a lot and I mean a lot of background noises and the other person can hardly hear you. On my end, it's clear, but for the other person, there's a lot of noise and hissing. I've talked to tech support from Jabra and they've sent me three of the same headset, but I'm still having problems. They don't even know why I'm having this problem and they don't know what to do. I've even gone as far as getting a replacement phone, thinking that it's my phone, but I still have the same problem. I would not get this product again and don't recommend anyone to get it either."
2,jabra head phones,Good sound for the head phones. They do lack in comfort. And they have a nasty habit of cutting out from time to time.
1,Undergraduate Essays,"Far from useful to students of Canadian literature, this isa collection of undergraduate essays colored more by frustration and anger than any kind of literary sensibility. The author seems to think pompous and convulated obscurities are preferable to objective clarity, and the result is an amateurish mixture of idolatry and adolescent revenge. I'm amazed it ever got published, unless the author funded it himself."
4,Brief Knowledge,"After reading the book, i would like to state that it is usefull for students who would like to have information and teachers who would like to give information on the issue. Good design with adequate pictures."
1,wrong,"Well the product was ok, the only problem is they sent an oriole's beach towl instead of a Raven's one, luckily it was a gift for my father and he likes both teams."
4,Fierce,She has done a lot of great work over the years. If you like Kylie Minogue this DVD should definitely be a part of your collection.
5,Just Too Good,"I have never been a Kylie Minogue fan before, but I really am now. The first CD didn't really cut it for me, too old school, but her more recent songs on the second disc are just awesome. ""Red Blooded Woman"" has an awesome beat, and with classics like ""Can't Get You Out Of My Head"" and ""Kids"" brings you back to some great tunes. Even though its 2 CDs, the second CD alone is worth it, and there are some good songs on CD1. If you have never really been a fan of Kylie, i suggest you buy this CD now, and it just kicks ass."
5,Great book didn't want it to end,"Loved the book.Hated how it ended could have gone longer.My daughter also enjoyed the book,could not put it down"
1,disapointing,The book is not really about sound design. It does not give any new techical information and the musical stuff is very basic. In the book says that the CD files can be used for classes but ther isn't anything that is worthwile (and they are only a few!!!). The only information that it has some interest is about games sound design but is very very short.It was disapointing.Do not be fulled by the tittle.
4,A Dream We All Wish We Could Follow,"I thoroughly enjoyed the Sherman's experience of life on the road. They are an amazing couple with an incredible dog. This book will make you laugh and understand their stress, but most of all, it will make you jealous that a young couple could just leave their jobs and fulfull their quest. I strongly recommend this book for those who would like to follow their dream........."
3,Disappointing sequel,"You know what they say... sequels are never as great as originals. I waited for what seems like forever for this book, and it was kinda disappointing. It didn't have the same magic Sister Light, Sister Dark had. The storytelling seemed kind of rushed and Skada's role was underplayed too much. All in all, a fizzling conclusion to a good beginning."
3,Funny - but not *that* funny,"I loved the first season - I expected the same from this one. While I am only halfway through this season, I am not as impressed by the writing. The humor is good but a bit tired at this point. Same old phrases, sayings and mannerisms. It is pretty funny but not hilarious. Not sure I would purchase again."
1,Contained the Trojan.Arugizer virus,DO NOT plug this device into your PC! I purchased the device and as soon as I plunged it in Sysmantec detected the Trojan.Arugizer virus. It turns our the hardware on the device is loaded with a Trojan house which can give an attacker access to your PC! Energizer has failed to report the issue to it's customers and still sells it. DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE.
5,USB Battery Charger Works Great with My Computer,Great charger for NiMh batteries that I can use with my laptop. Great for travel--no heavy charger transformer to carry on trips.
2,Repetitive and Simplistic,"If you take out all the safe sex advice, which frankly by 2008 we all should know, there are not 125 ideas or ""tricks"" to make sex better. Most of these don't have much to do with supermarkets exclusively either. Over all I was very disappointed with this variation on the ""tricks"" books by Jay Wiseman."
2,Not a place to start,"The first three chapters of this book are unredeemable. They jump all over the place and completely clutter the narrative; almost as if they are unstuck in time like Billy Pilgrim; or the author couldn't figure out how to index background information and tried to tell you everything about a person in a single paragraph. It gets better later when the author seems to calm down and hit his stride. Oddly I found reading it from the back a better approach. There are some real gems in here, like the letter from the Viginia cavalryman which I hadn't encountered before, but its placement belongs in an index; bits of it should have been used more appropriately in the text. Unfortunately, in order to understand ""September 11, 1777,"" you already have to have considerable knowledge about the battle in order to sort what you are reading. For a reader with casual interest, or tourist, this one will be confusing. A reenactor may find it of value."
3,Expected More,"This book reads like one very long newpaper article. There are not any documents recently discovered here. Not enough of the book is dedicated to the actual battle. I felt there were some lulls in the text, and was left thinking,'there is no new information here.' What is in the book was certainly researched, perhaps rushed into writing. And there is very little commentary, if any, on the non-combatants. I also was left thinking is this a history of the Philadelphia campaign or the Battle of Brandywine? Although not much has been written on this battle this book adds little, if any, new discoveries. I was somewhat disappointed, but I recommend this book to anybody that has some background info. on the Revolutionary War, but little knowledge of the forgotten Battle of Brandywine. The book deserves credit for having much information (and sources already known), however, in a limited amount of pages related to both the battle and campaign."
2,Sammy In Concert? This is: Sammy in B&W (low-fi),"I loved SDJ and saw him in concert several times in the 1970s. That is what I thought I was ordering, Sammy IN CONCERT. This DVD is a collection of B&W performances from his youth. I would not be disgruntled if I felt as though the product was adequately described on Amazon."
2,Parenting with a strong Christian frame of reference.,"This book is very good but be aware that this book is about parenting from a Christian frame of reference. There are frequent quotes for the New Testament with references to God, forgiveness and even Satan."
1,Very buggy,"I really tried to give this software a chance, but it simply doesn't work.During installation it told me I wouldn't need the CD if I copied a folder to the hard disk. It didn't tell me where so i just put it in the program folder.Once I tried to use the software it made me go online for a registration code which ended up in gmail's spam folder.When I actually tried to use the software (on windows xp) it would get stuck after about 3 minutes of use and often not display the word i was supposed to translate or say a different word than the one I was on.Even if it weren't so buggy that it could be useful, it is about as basic and bone dry as a language teaching software could get. Which is unfortunate, because it does at least have a reasonable amount of content. It's a pity you can't access it, however.Overall, a real disappointment."
1,Refund Received,"This software did not work properly, and technical assistance was not available. However, the seller did eventually refund the purchase price."
5,The Deputy complete series,"It was easy to order and delivery was fast. This series was one of the best of its time and still holds your attention. Henry Fonda is always charming and Wallace Ford is great as the aging sheiff and Allen Case as the Deputy gives a very real performance. Great to see it again, I love it."
4,"if you lke your movies chock full of boobs, bombs and buttheads then this is not the movie for you","But if you like movies that test an actor to the limit with subtle emotional depths and elegant, not overblown ""LOOK I AM A PLOT TWIST!!"" kind of movie then perhaps this one is for you. Not to mention Adrien Brody has the perfect face for a movie that demands a lot of undertext and nuanced emotional mechanics. I enjoyed it!"
3,Beach Umbrella Madness,"My cranky boyfriend always complains about the beach umbrella possibly blowing away, because I don't dig the pole deep enough into the sand! Well...cranky boyfriend is gone and the sand anchor is now my new beach buddy. The product is light, easy to insert into the sand, and holds my umbrella secure.Just be careful not to apply too much presure on to the plastic turn rods. Worth the money!"
4,fine sand anchor,"Bought two of these anchors, one for us and one for my folks. We had excellent luck with them. Easy to use and did the trick in the afternoon winds of the Maine beach."
2,sand anchor,"The grip bars to turn anchor in the sand could be sturdier, it feels as though they may break off. But, if careful, the anchor works great once in the sand."
2,disappointed,"I was really disappointed when I opened this up and it had such a strong fake coconut smell. I thought it was just oil, but when I looked at the ingredients and there is ""fragrance"" in it. Now I can't use it in my all natural lotion and will have to buy another brand. I guess ""tropical essence"" means ""fragrance"". Too bad."
4,A great book to have as a reference,This is a must have to learn about world geography! It is very detailed and is a fairly easy read. A lot of detail without going over your head if you are not science oriented. I am intrigued about the evolution of the world's landscape and I am looking forward to finishing the book.
4,what weezer should have been,"i glad ozma is getting some attention. i first got into them when they were an anonymus, unsigned band in CA. i knew they were good, and i knew someday they d be big. then i got to see them open for weezer, and they honestly stole the show. they played with more emotion, and actually a tighter set than weezer.but i m sure ozma doesnt want to be compared to weezer...they do have their own thing going. ozma sounds a bit like the old weezer, premaladroit, pre green album, even pre pinkerton. if ozma sounds like weezer at, they sound like the early weezer stuff, the b sides, the heavier more emotive weezer. but ozma indeed has a nice flavor, and with this album they show how poppy they can make russian cold fusion sound."
5,minor mistake,Great book but a saxophone is a woodwind instrument not a brass instrument because it uses a reed.....
5,Lovely,A charming book which my 3 year-old daughter greatly enjoys. We talk about why there are phases of the moon and the life of nocturnal animals. And it's fun. [Note: I'm not related to the main character.]
3,pleasantly surprised,"-Baught one in barbados to share ipod music with a group of friends. The sound quality deteriorated when the batteries went low (more than 12 hours if you use good quality new batteries). I was pleasantly surprised at how well the speakers worked. They are not for you if you want the ""blast the boom box"" sound. To listen to around the table while you chat with your friends, they are perfect. The price is great - especially for young children. Ours came with a usb adapter. If you shop around you can get a good price on a usb wall adapter. Perfect size for travel."
2,Ironing board pad,this item is not made well-the pattern of the ironing board goes through to the item I am working on. I will not buy this item again.
1,weak!,Boring! I just thought it would be more funny and interesting to look at. Fine black beautiful people is all I see but poor áctors! Very low budget!
4,reunion dreams?,"Sometimes people forget......that's what pete townsend said in""eminence front"" but sometimes people do....These two guys had not played together in concert when this concert took place in more than 20 years except for a couple of impromtu performances one which was at the grammys that year or maybe the year before that(I can't remember exactly,if you can remember you were'nt there.....LOL)well that's a cliche now but at the time it was very much the case...These guys did just about everything that had ever been played by them in their heyday.....plus a couple of gems that were'nt performed very often even then...probably the best live version of ""Old Friends""""Bookends"" that they have ever done and a great ""Parley,Sage,Rosemary and Thyme"" what can you say....Simon and Garfunkel together wrote the songs that make us what we are today...........The Toad.........Lives"
2,the CD does not contain what was on the lp,"I liked this recording so much I decided to purchase the CD, to replace the album and to accent the DVD that I have. I was shocked to discover that all the chatter between songs was eliminated. This should have been noted on the CD description.Sure the songs are great, but some of the whole sense of their being ""in concert"", i.e., all the asides and such, are missing. I give it two stars only because I wish that producers of CDs and DVDS would be more forthcoming about what they cut from a title of the same name."
2,Live Concert Not Worth the Time or Money,"Everything I hate about live concert recordings are in this CD: half the CD space is wasted by audience noise and applause, plus introducing people I couldn't care less about; background noise; live action that does not provide good quality sound or music. It was great listening to songs I haven't heard in years, but I would prefer to spend the money on MP3 downloads and get good quality. For the people at the concert this would probably be good memories, but concert remakes should be cleaned up better for sale to others."
4,Their Greatest Hits In A Live Setting,"The historic reunion of S&G. Succeeds better than their ""Greatest Hits"" album which uses a mixture of live and studio cuts. This is an event that also highlighted some of Simon's solo songs. After this, explore the original albums or the superb Old Friends box set."
2,The worst of Simon and Garfunkel,"The idea of a reunion might seem romantic, especially if we are talking about the best duo that pop music have ever created. Anyway, here the problem is not the noble intention but the execution. The band backing the sublime S&G's voices and guitars is awful. The choice of instruments, with all that keyboards and horns ruins the simple melody and essential instruments backgrounding the original songs. So, if you want to know better the music of Simon and Grafunkel, PLEASE!, don't buy this ""illusion"". If you absolutely need a collection, try the 2CD of TALES FROM NEW YORK (THE VERY BEST OF) instead (but I think it's a european-only release)."
1,DEX and SUPERDOG (The Heart of a Hero),DEX and SUPERDOG (The Heart of a Hero) are the SAME BOOK do not get fooled into buying both. What a RIP OFF!
1,Poor quality,"The chain was broken when received even though it was still in the sealed, factory bubble/cardboard display pack. Company replaced it without problem. Replacement chain broke the first day I wore it.Links are very soft. The least amount of stress will open the links and gone are glasses.Even at this low price, NOT WORTH IT.EXCEPT - I have saved the little connectors that attack to the glasses and plan to use my own chain or cord. A bit expensive for two little loops of plastic."
2,The chain is flimsy and too short,Didn't care for this at all. The chain is too short and keeps the glasses nearly under my chin. Also the chain is a cheap thing that broke with just a tug on the glasses.
1,Fake reviews,"My mistake to buy the book before checking the five star reviews.Of all the five star reviews, only 4 have at least two other product reveiews, the rest only review this book which could mean the author paid peple to write those reviews.Now, I am stuck with a useless book."
5,The Most Impressive Vionlinist in Music Today,"I am a struggling classical violinist interested in 20th century music. A friend of mine hipped me up to Mat Maneri when I was visiting New York last year. He was dynamic, he did things on the violin that we so awsome I wanted to throw my violin in the garbage. Well I didn't bu after hearing the virtuosity displayed on Trinity, not to mention the shear imagination of this guy is like a one in a generation kind of thing. Musicians, and true music appreciators, violin teachers and students you will be amazed if you have any ears to listen with."
4,Dark Horse a winner going away,The young and gorgeous actress Ari Meyers stars as a troubled girl who gets injured in an accident. She then has to learn a whole new way of life without use of her legs.
3,"Good movie, no classic but solid acting by Begley, Jr.","This movie went a bit too slow for me, but overall, it was a good film. Made me cry a couple times when soem horrific things happened to the horse. But it was genuinely a well written story and Begley, Jr. is always a solid actor. The man is one of the greats of his era, as his Oscar winning father was a great in his. Tab Hunter did a great job with a small part. But his greatest film is: Track of the Cat."
5,Love this welding wire,"What can be better than a roll of Hobart wire on a Hobart Handler 187? Maybe a cold beer on a hot Sunday afternoon.I'm writing a review of the wire so let me get at it. I have gone through a half dozen (at least) 2 lb spools of this solid wire from Hobart through my Hobart Handler 187. I don't like to purchase the larger spools because I don't want the wire to corrode/rust while it's sitting in my enclosed garage. Once the wire starts to corrode/rust, you gotta throw the entire spool out in the trash!This is the largest size wire that my Handler 187 can accomodate (0.035"") which allows me to easily weld 1/4"" plate. Highly recommended!!!!!"
1,"Product I love, but a few days from expiration date","I love Tumaro's tortillas and was thrilled to see that I can order them from you, as they are not sold in my area. I typically buy them when I travel to other cities.Normally the expiration date is two months in advance. Your product was less than a week out of date. WHY? I do not plan to order these wonderful tortillas or any other groceries from Amazon again.Thanks for listening,Dr. Ginner Hudson"
3,Caroline Dahl,"I bought 2 cd's of this artist because I was looking for different versions of Malegeuna. Well, she kind of plays it, but certainly her way. A piano with very little prominent back up. Sounds unrefined but good enough for lounge sound. She can play the instrument, more talent than I would ever have, but just a little lower keyed than I would prefer. Maybe amateur is a good description. I am not trying to be mean, but accurate. Again, if you want something slower and not anything awe inspiring, which is fine, then this may be your deal."
4,Decent enough,Mixes well in a blender and no powdery taste noted. NOthing special but nothing bad either.
2,Was great at one time--back in the days of slide rules,"From everything I've read and heard, this was the authoritative book on the subject at one time. But, having been written in 1976, before PCs, it discusses data analysis using slide rules for computation and rulers for graph analysis. I need something to help me understand predictive modeling on SPSS. Is there something better?"
3,Examine the product description carefully,"If you like Highlander Bagpipes you should like this one, with ONE caveat, it is released under several different names with the identical content. If you are increasing your already established library, you may already have this one. Examine the titles list and compare it to what you have, after buying several discs at one time it turned out that this identical programming was recieved on three separate discs under different titles and ""performer"" names. It is generic Bagpiping. Recording quality is middle to good.Jeff"
4,"Easy, quick and solid taxes for the Mac","This is my first time using tax preparation software, and after looking over many poor reviews for TurboTax on the Mac, I went with TaxCut. I found the product to be simple to use, very intuitive and filled with just the right kinds of ""interviews"" that made filling out forms and filing my taxes very easy.I too had the problem of downloading the updates, and after trying to click the ""get latest version"" button to no avail I followed the directions to the TaxCut site where I was able to successfully download and install the updates. I filed my return electronically yesterday, and found out 12 hours later that it had been accepted by both Federal and State.Overall an excellent product for the Mac, and one that I'll purchase again next year."
1,2004 a big disappointment from previous years,"I've used TaxCut for several years (and MacInTax before that). Although there have always been glitches, this year was total meltdown. The Federal worked okay, but then I downloaded the State (MA)per the instructions and installed it. Some items didn't transfer correctly from Federal to State, and when I went to print, the entire return (federal and state) was wiped out on the drive. I tried to restart TaxCut, only to be faced with a blank form and a corrupted interface. I sent an email to the support desk per their instructions. Haven't heard anything back except for a request asking me to fill out a survey about my experience of their customer support. I'll wait until I actual experience their customer support before doing so.As a former believer, I am probably feeling a bit betrayed. Nevertheless, save your money on this one, folks. Even with the rebate, it simply ain't worth the aggravation or poor support."
2,So so snoopy sheet,"I am a huge fan of Peanuts and especially Snoopy so my son's nursery was Baby Snoopy. Now that he is a toddler he gets his bed dirty a lot faster so I picked up a couple extra fitted sheets to cut down on how often I have to do laundry.This sheet is cute but made of very thin flimsy material. I have several Snoopy fitted sheets from various collections and this one was the most expensive and the cheapest made.In my humble opinion, unless you really like this particular collection I recommend a different Snoopy sheet."
2,Agreed - very thin sheets,I agree with the other reviewers. Recommend not buying these sheets. It ripped almost immediately after buying it. Not a good use of $15.
3,Sequel not quite up to prequel.,"I read this part of the series first. I liked it well enough to hunt out the first part, which I loved far more. I think I was mostly disappointed because the story itself didn't live up to the jacket summary. About 90% of the novel had to do with the past and Matisse and Brianna's young lives. I had hoped for at least a 50-50 proposition here. I would have loved for the wolf researcher to know Nicholas well enough to fall for him. In short, I guess I was hoping for some romance between the woman who'd lost her husband in a car accident and the man who was also a wolf. Hopefully, the third installment will show Nicholas in as romantic a light as ""The Passion"" showed Alexander."
1,Buyer beware!!,"SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND!!!!! The ingredients listed on the website for this item are NOT accurate!!!!! I need to avoid gluten. There is no gluten listed on the website ingredients list; however, when I received the product, there IS gluten in it!!!!! SELLER DOES NOT CARE IF YOU ARE SATISFIED OR NOT, DOES NOT RESPOND TO COMPLAINTS AFTER SEVERAL E-MAILS HAVE BEEN SENT!!"
3,Greek terrorism,"When I first was made aware of this book, I thought, hot dog! At last a book on one of the most fascinating revolutionary gangs in last 100 years. Then I read the book. It's not a bad book, but it's not a good one, either. Thick, viscous prose and about double too much of it. I think maybe this is a better tool for security pros than just us grunts trying to understand the world we've made. Lots of social background about Greece and its recent history, which is good but difficult to wade through, which is bad. Also, Kassimeris is a Greek journalist and from my dozen years of living in that country, I know that Greek journalism tends to be long on guesswork and short on facts. In any case, it simply isn't worth the astounding price... ( especially when you can get essentially the same info from the same author on janes.com for free )."
3,"ok, but I was looking for more","It was ok, but where the prologue offered some depth, I found the book to be mostly shallow. Interesting characters, but although I bought the next two books in the series, I put the series down after this one, and am not sure I'll get back to it, even to see whether the brothers are reunited."
3,Sophmoric self-deprecation,"Christopher Smith tells us all about his foibles along life's path. Most of his humor arises from embarrassing moments that he relives for us. The themes revolve around body parts and amorous quests that never quite pan out. One frustration was that he tells us that he is giving us memoirs that he has enhanced for humorous effect. So one finds oneself constantly wondering where the truth ends and the fiction begins--the same sort of feeling one gets reading a ""historical"" novel. While confessing all Smith nonetheless manages to maintain arm's length from his audience--we don't learn about the deeper side of the author, though it must be lurking in there somewhere as the jacket claims he has written sixteen books"
1,And I'm Sure UT Hates U2,This self-loathing Vol must be considered the Roy Cohn of the SEC. Except he's balder.
2,Biased and Outdated,"While I understand Coon's need to give only the briefest highlights of certain conditions or methods of therapy, the information he presents is often one-sided or hopelessly outdated. For example, in listing sleep disorders, he gives an obsolete definition of Narcolepsy which completely ignores such vital symptoms as cataplexy. In this list of sleep disorders, he almost completely ignores REM Sleep Behavioral Disorder, which we are discovering is surprisingly common. The one snippet of information presented suggests that RBD presents only with violent behavior. This is, again, outdated information. Coons work is not representative of the current thinking of most experts in the fields which he attempt to survey."
3,Watch Out for those Biting Corpses!,"This is strange stuff! Decapitations, Suicides, Murders, Fetus-Eating Corpses... Reader Beware!This is the first ""Absurdism"" material I've read. It certainly lives up to its reputation. Its certainly not my favorite literary style but it was a quick and interesting read. My favorite story was ""The Old Woman"" by Kharms. You've got to keep an eye on those corpse-containing suitcases!I recommend this book to anyone looking for something completely out of the ordinary. It certainly earns a place in the libraries of those collecting Russian Literature. The book contains several poems in Russian at the end which may be of interest to those who know Russian.On a side note, I've read many of the Russian literature books published by Northwestern University Press. All their books are good quality with sturdy covers and good quality paper. I highly recommend Northwestern University Press publications."
1,Buggy! Moldy! Plants do not grow well!,Lots of small flies flying around the pots and when I planted lettuce and spinach I got a lot of poisonous toadstools growing in with my vegetables. Also getting surface mold in my potted plants.
1,Wish I'd read the reviews first,"Add me to the list of folks who lost almost all my summer annuals to this mess! I have been planting impatiens in pots in the same spot for over 10 years and they've always perform beautifully. We're in the south, so we've always watered almost everyday, especially in the heat. This year, my impatiens died after just a couple weeks in the pots...every single one of them! I'm going to dig one up...my suspicion is that the mix doesn't allow the roots to expand to take in water. I've always used Miracle Gro potting mix, but I'll probably try another brand next time. This moisture control stuff is terrible!"
1,Rip off.,"Avoid this cd. The music is excellent but the packaging and total tracks are a rip off. In this day and age there's no excuse for putting out such a skimpy cd set. It would be nice to see a solid single disc set out but this isn't the one. Knowing how money grubbing the labels are, I'm sure we'll get a few more compilations out of Alice In Chains. Buy the 2 disc Essential' set."
5,SWEET!!!!!!,"Alice In Chains are one of the greatest Grunge bands in the world. Mellow sounding Alternative rock, it soothes the soul and makes you want to dance and sing. Has a hard edge and like i said also mellow. what can i say besides Nirvana, Alice is up there."
3,too good to be reduced to one cd...,"Alice in Chains has a catalog of incredible music that I just don't think should be compressed to the list of primarily radio singles that appears on this greatest hits cd. If you are buying this album because you want to learn about this band, then try the original albums. Pick one. Any one. They're all fabulous and well worth a listen."
3,Good intro to Alice in Chains,"I agree with a few of the reviewers here - this CD does not do Alice in Chains justice. However, for someone sick of ""Nu Metal"" looking for good rock with a metal edge (And a razor sharp one at that) could do much worse than buy this CD.There's no liner notes, no new pictures, no ""unreleased"" songs. Come to think of it, this CD probably should be called ""Their Most Popular Songs"". However, the song selection on ""Greatest Hits"" runs the gamut of Alice in Chains, showcasing a great range of their different tones of music.If you're a longtime Alice in Chains fan, no sense in buying this - you already have all these song. If you want something new and haven't heard anything but ""Man in the Box"" or ""No Excuses"" on the radio, do yourself a favor and get this one."
1,What the hell is this?,"This compilation doesn't even have Dam That River, Down in a Hole, or Nutshell. This compilation is a damn shame to Alice in Chains. They deserve better. If you agree, click that ""yes"" button below."
1,"Dont waste your money, stick with the studio albums.","Just buy the album's, AIC had no need for a greatest hits. All there albums were greatest hits. This is just a record company ploy to make money. If your looking to start somwhere buy ""Dirt""."
4,i enoyed it,the sound quality is not horrible! its sounds great to me.as was said before the mixes are different. thats good though because its a new way of hearing the songs. if you want the original get the cds.this is a best of and should have been longer. 10 tracks is not enough.the bass is slightly lacking but is fine. use of the rear channels is ok. not much you can do with grunge.recommened to people with good sacd systems.
4,THIS CHEESEY MOVIE GREW ON ME,"With every watching, this movie was like cheese mold, grew and made it better and better... hard to explain. All I know is it felt good at the end, very satisfying like a well aged cheese."
5,Powerful summary of the way of naples poor,"Thomas was my cousin. He was always an amazing person to be around. He died a few years ago from a disease called AIDS. He was a very brave man. He was not a man dying with AIDS, he was a man living with AIDS. Throughout his lifetime, Tommy was a very devoted man. He was a caring generous person. He is greatly missed."
5,24 Season Four,"Much more fun after a rather dark season 3. Some of my favorite moments involve Chloe's storyline. Catch the look on Jack's face when Cloe says that she's always there for him. Then there's that moment that many of us have faced in more mundane jobs, where Chloe's boss says she's got to go out in the field and she says ""oh, I don't do that"". And then there's her interaction with Edgar. There's many great moments with supporting characters in general. The new president brings alot of interesting moments. You'll enjoy this season!"
5,Still One Of The Most Thrilling Series on TV!,"I was hooked from Series 1! My girlfriend bought the first series for me so that I would have something to watch for the weekend that she left Germany, and ever since then, I have not been able to just watch one disk per day like I had intended. The episodes are so realistic they grip you by the seat of your pants,(or skirt) until the 24Hours are over! Kiefer Sutherland is an outstanding actor!"
4,What Criminal Act Will Jack Bauer Commit Next?,"Like all the 24 episodes, this one is entertaining and engrossing - ""addicting"" would not be too strong a word. Also like the others, it requires a healthy suspension of disbelief, particularly as to time. (LA appears to have no traffic jams at any time of the day.) Personally, I find that the whole show is put together so effectively that the obvious ""Oh, come on now!""s don't bother me too much.I can, however, imagine the writers and the producers at a meeting to discuss the plot line:""Well, let's see, so far in this series Jack Bauer has committed murder, assault, theft, kidnapping, burglary, torture, interfering with a Federal investigation, and about two dozen random Federal premises crimes. What criminal act has he not committed that we can have him do this season?""""How about having him knock over a service station?""""Hey, good idea!""Of such stuff is ""24"" made. If you don't like that stuff, don't watch it."
4,Thursdays at Eight,"This book tells four separate stories of four women who meet in a class on journal-writing and then agree to get together once a week for breakfast at 8:00. Most of the chapters tell the separate stories of the four women; a lonely widow, an embittered divorcee, a young girl who has aspirations for an acting career, and a woman with children in their teens who unexpectedly becomes pregnant. The breakfast meetings allow them to share their trials and problems and when things go bad for any of them, the others are there to lend their support. As I read about situations which I had been through, I realized that Macomber's narration of these characters' feelings is right on target and the situations are realistically portrayed. Reading this book encourages me to look for other books by this author."
5,debbie does it again!!,"Thursdays at Eight is a book about four women who meet in a journal writing class and form a breakfast club after their classes end. They become friends even though each woman is at a different stage in her life. One is single, one is married, one is divorced and the fourth is widowed. These women all have different lives but connect with each other in their friendships. They are each others support group when they need support and encouragement.This book is absolutely wonderful. The characters will appeal to any woman of any age. Any woman can definitely identify with at least one of the four characters. I thought this aspect was wonderful. I was greatly touched while reading this book. I just couldn't put it down. I would definitely recommend this book!"
3,Maybe a little milking (love one piece but 1 disk is not okay),I am all for new one piece releases but really a 1 disk release with an msrp of $39.98.I think one piece season four voyage 1 should have just contained 3 disks at a slightly higher msrp because this will just be a volume in all honesty.Once again I love OP but 1 disk come on!
1,It's like lighting a $500 bill on fire,"Like many folks buying auto parts on Amazon, I try to save money by buying the part online and installing it myself or having my mechanic install it so I can avoid the markup on dealer supplied parts. Do NOT do this with this part. Installation of this sensor required my motor to be disassembled, the part put in, and the motor reassembled costing around $450 in labor. My (ASE certified) mechanic did this and the ODB-II code was not resolved. I'm not sure if the part was defective or if the compatibility selection by Amazon was wrong, but this part was definitely the problem. The mechanic just replaced the sensor with an (presumably) OEM part and my car is purring again. After calling Amazon, they are issuing me a refund for the defective part only, but I'm chalking up all the wasted time, anxiety, effort and money to a cheap lesson in buying this type of auto part on Amazon: STAY AWAY!"
2,Misleading,The item description needs to state clearly that there is no soldering iron/gun/station included in this one and that you need to order the other kit if you don't already have a soldering iron/gun/station.
2,Great...more Bond...,"Great, they brought out more James Bond. As if the original Dr. No theme wasn't annoying enough before, now it sounds twice as good (or bad if you don't like the music). And if you dont want to spend more than $100.00 each set, watch Spike TV during Thanksgiving - they repeat all the James Bond movies so much it really gets on your nerves. Good stories, the movies weren't so good..."
1,"7 Great Bond Films, but you can only see 6 of them........","I was very excited to see the James Bond 007 DVDs come back out on the market at a reasonable price (I missed the first releases a few years ago). I love these films and the extras on these DVDs are great. The only problem is.. not all of them are viewable! ""The Man with the Golden Gun"" is defective! You can only watch it up to scene 21 and then BAM! frozen screen. Amazon sent me a replacement set ASAP (they're great on customer service), but the replacement had the same problem. I tried it in 6 different DVD players and it happened in all of them. I called MGM and they confirmed that there is a problem and are replacing the DVD for people. If it wasn't for the hassle TMwtGG is causing me, this would be a 5 Star DVD set.... :-("
4,DAMN IT!!! A little too late!!!,"If only I had of known!!When I went to the local [store] and found out that there was a moratorium on James Bond DVD's, I still allowed my lust for Bond movies to consume me and went about purchasing select Bond movies at $... a pop. Now comes this box set release with some choice entries at an affordable price with the added bonus of no Timothy Dalton entries and I already own half of them. The only thing I can hope for, is that another box set is released with mostly Roger Moore Bond movies.About time another Bond DVD series is released, too bad it is happening now instead of back in July. I guess they had to make the box set availabe in time to whet everyone's appetite for the upcoming theatrical ""Die Another Day""."
3,Anybody Else Getting Defective Discs?,"I've ordered two of these sets, and apparently MGM has some mass-production problems. In both copies of TOMOROW NEVER DIES I've viewed, the ""1 of 2"" chapter designation keeps popping up in the upper right hand corner of the screen, which is very annoying and distracting. And in both copies of THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN GUN I've viewed, the picture deteriorates entirely at about scene 21 and never recovers! The exact same problem with separate copies of the same DVDs! Anyone else experiencing these problems? So far, DR. NO, LICENCE TO KILL and GOLDFINGER were fine. I've yet to get around to viewing GOLDENEYE and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME."
3,"Movies - 5 Stars, Shipping Condition - 0 Stars",The Movie are all time greats no doubt about that but the condition of the box itself was horrid. Looked like it had been removed from the wreckage of a 007 car chase.JMM
5,POST-HYPNOTIC INSTRUCTIONS,Arnold Furst is an accomplished hypnotist and here gives first rate information on how to make your hypnotic suggestions more powerful.He goes through many of the common issues and gives suggested patter. A great book for the professional hypnotist.
5,Use as center console for my Honda Element,"Fits perfectly. We screwed 2 cupholders on the front (cutting off the over-the-window-hooks) and 2 L brackets on the bottom to secure it in my vehicle's low tray so it would not slide back and forth.Love it. Don't much care if it keeps things hot or cold, just needed an affordable center console solution, and this was it!"
1,Bad Communication,"I canceled this order for this book and it was sent anyway and my account was charged. When I consulted with the company they informed me that it would be a restocking fee and that I would have to pay for the postage, so now I have two of the same book and out of my money."
5,A powerful and recommended guide with a message of hope,"Tony Schwarz's Phoenix Rising: 12 Golden Keys To Unlock Your Depression is an informative, effective, step-by-step process and self-help guide to becoming ""the director of your own recovery"" from depression. Golden Key principal number one is ""Discover a Higher Power that Makes Sense To You,"" and the other Golden Key principles range from ""Form Your Own Professional Support Team"" to ""Perform Physical and Spiritual Exercises Every Day."" Numerous appendixes offer information and flesh out a variety of mental health issues related to depression, from contact information to selected mental health organizations to the twelve steps of Co-Dependents Anonymous. An index allows for easy reference. Phoenix Rising is a powerful and recommended guide with a message of hope for those undergoing bleak travails."
2,Oh MY GOD,"Please. As a Math teacher. WOW! I can NOT understand this book. If you are looking for a book to make things more clear and present a review to your current understanding then find another book! This one is way too difficult to read - unless I suppose all you can relate to is numbers and signs, not humans."
1,cheap plastic --- can be sure to fall apart in your hand within 8 months.,"In two years, I've owned three of these. Each time, the plastic over the click fell apart in my hand. Each time I replaced it, paying almost $50. I suggest that you get WACOM Penabled Executive Cross pen (if you can find it, often sold out) instead for about the same money. By the way, I spent a morning on the phone with Lenovo about this dumb digitizer pen. Please don't if you value your sanity."
3,OK,I wanted a book on sharpening with more detail. It is a very good book for the basics. For someone wanting the basics this would be a good book.
5,Sharpening Complete,"This is by far the best text on the subject that I have seen. It takes a scientific approach to the subject, starting with methods to identify the compsition of the steel, and identifying those methods of sharpening one should not use as well as those best suited to the material. I have sent this book to a number of friends who I consider to be experts, and they have been universally impressed."
3,"Good performances, but negligible music","I place myself second to none in my admiration for the music of Wilhelm Stenhammar; his Serenade, for instance, is one of the towering orchestral works of its period. But this is a recording of early compositions by Stenhammar, little more than student works, composed before he'd found his unique ""face"" as a composer."
2,Better product description,It would be helpful if the product description identified these as ball end strings or loop. Didn't catch it when I ordered them and these are not the kind I need so now I have to return.
5,Running out of superlatives to describe this book,"This book has unbelievably clear explanations. Actually it is so good that it makes the lecturer superfluous. For years I felt I did not really understand the proof of the Cook Levin theorem. Sure, I had Garey and Johnson, and I more or less could follow the proof, but I wouldn't have been able to reproduce it on my own. With this book, it has become crystal clear, and now I would be able to explain it in front of any audience without any preparation. If you're taking a computation course and this is not your assigned textbook, go buy it now!"
5,CKY: Best Band Ever?,"From the second I heard the opening riff of ""96 Quite Bitter Beings"" I knew this band was gonna be great, and boy was I right. This is the first band in quite some time to catch my attention like this, they haven't got a song that I don't like. With a band full of people with great talent and varying tastes in music, the outcome is something that is unlike any other band out right now. They just write really amazing songs, and have a great energy, PLUS, you can't beat how cool they are to the fans. Buy this CD, trust me, you'll never want to take it out of your CD player."
2,Wonder Wheeler,"The mesh bag came apart the first day of use. Looked like a defect.However, since this bag is one of the most important features of this product, I decided to return it. Returned using the label from this web site and have not heard from Amazon since.I've always had good experience from customer service; however, so far I have not receive any response from my emails."
3,Magnetometer Reference,This book in including everything has no meat about anything. References are presented in lieu of in depth analysis. A good starting point and a wealth of references.
4,KLH AT 2100i Home Audio System,"I have to say I was surprised how well this system works with my LCD TV. It was quite simple to set up and I liked the towers that the speakers mounted to. The sound is excellent, and is a great option for those situations where a 5.1 surround system won't be feasible. My only issue is relatively minor.There is a low hum that emanates from the speakers when the system is left ""on"" (after turning off the TV). If you turn the power off on the sub-woofer you have to reset the volume each time you turn the TV back on - so leaving the power on is recommended. I called the factory and spoke to a very knowledgeable and helpful tech rep who had some suggestions and modifications that would alleviate the hum. It's pretty much unnoticeable after a few months of having the system. For the low cost and the overall quality I would highly recommend this system."
4,Dino is great in this.,This product arrived here so quickly and in perfect condition. The concert is fantastic and I would definately order from this seller again.
3,It is OK.,Quality ?I can't say this Slate with holder is good quality.But holder is good to attach my BC.
2,The receipts are not Interesting,"I bought this book because I wanted the equivalent of the ""Python Cookbook"" but for C++. However, I didn't find that level of information on the C++ version of the cookbook. Quite disappointing.However, I have found out that a similar level of expertise can be found in the typical ""Exceptional"" and ""Essential"" book series. But also in the wonderful CodeProject web page http://www.codeproject.com/."
5,xo mom,"This whole series is timeless and wonderful. My husband and I remembered these when we were kids, our kids were read them and now I am passing them on to the next generation!"
4,Good Read,"This is a good, decent read. Not the greatest wrestling book out yet still it is entertaining."
3,A good guide,ASL should be presented in true fashion to the children. Five of the pictures shown are not true ASL.
1,Not What I Expected,"The pictures in this book are beautiful. I was hoping to share them with my daughter, but they are different from all of the signs we have been teaching her. We are using ASL or modified ASL signs and most of these don't match."
3,"Not what I expected,",Wasn't impressed by this item. It was listed as being in better shape than what it actually was - at least I didn't spend too much on it.
4,Handyperson skills required,"If you are good with crafts and building things and you are kinky, then this is a great book for you. The 99 different projections range from simple 10 minute creations to furniture that will take a few days to make. Cost to make also varies from a buck or two to over a hundred dollars. I gave this 4 instead of 5 stars because this is a collection of projects by several different people and thus the instructions vary greatly in terms of technical knowledge required to follow them. The ""fundamentals"" section which starts the book attempts to help those of us with less craft knowledge, but frankly it may not be enough help."
3,ok,this milk is ok to make yogurt. However you really need a blender if you are going to use it. That is the only way to remove the lumps. It is kind of sticky. overall ok.
2,Quality !!!,"Poor Quality, but i guess the price should tell the quality of the product even without trying. I don't think i will buy it again"
2,How he did it,"I did not like it at all.I feel cheated in a way,because I was expecting the book and the history of his struggles to write was what this book is about.I don't really care.But that's just me."
1,What?,"I am a big fan of the Christmas Box books, but when I saw this book I thought UHHHHHH I guess he needs even more money. RPE must have realized that he was a flash in the pan, and was desprate to hang on to his falling fame. This book does have its moments though, but it sounds like a broken record. They were giving this book away.. a free copy with every $10 purchase. I wish RPE would get over himself he's no Charles Dickens!!!"
1,Complete Nonsense,"There are quite a few con men who have taken advantage of the greatest bull market in history to fool the gullible. Wade Cook is one of the worst. 20 years ago he was selling books on no money down real estate deals. Not conincidentally, real estate at that time was booming.The book really deseves 0 stars"
2,Rain man goes to Wall Street,"Don't worry about wading too deep into the ever shallowing waters of Wade Cook's book. It's a mile wide and an inch deep. Oh, that he would have paid for an editor! Nonetheless, if you want to read the most elementary work on a broad range of loosely connected subjects, this books is still not for you. But if you want a primer on options trading, it could be a place to start, if you can borrow the book from a forgetful friend and replace the jacket for when you go out in public."
2,Disappointed,"I am a retired executive who has invested in the market for years. In order to expand my knowledge in options, I decided to read a book that would inform about such. I heard a lot about this book and the concepts are very interesting. However, I think that Wade Cook paints a picture that is too optomistic for a beginner. He also does a very poor job of explaining his methods and assumes too much. He needs to add a lot more details in his explanations. He is not a very good instructor.After reading his book, I don't feel prepared to trust in my knowledge to begin risking money in the options market. I am looking for another book with better explanations."
3,Fascinating Courtroom drama,"Mary, Mary is a fascinating courtroom drama....except for the ending. The ending is contrived and just plain silly. But then, if one must run out of gas, I suppose it is better to do it near the end rather than the beginning."
5,You -must- read ONUG!,"I really enjoyed this book! Vincent M. Wales uses unconventional media to tell a touching and terrifying story, full of political and personal strife. While my first reaction was that this potential future would never be tolerated by the citizens on today's USA, it is a very real possibility and one to be wary of. His characters were well developed and revealed to their fullest, highlighting the complicated, dynamic nature of the human mind and heart. A great read."
4,Simply The Best!,"It is great to see Tina Turner back in the business, even if it is only a greatest hits collection, which I might add had a very strong debut. In her mid-60s, Tina is still doing it as ROUGH as she always did. It is great to have a 2 disc collection including new songs (""Open Arms"") as well as the greatest hit""NUTBUSH CITY LIMITS"", ""SIMPLY THE BEST"", ""LETS STAY TOGETHER"", ""PROUD MARY"",""PRIVATE DANCER"", and ""WHAT'S LOVE GOT TO DO WITH IT"" and many others. Face it, Tina Turner could rock before and she can still rock today!!!"
5,Tina Rocks!,"This is one of the best CDs that I have purchased in a long time. There is not one single song that I dislike, and that, as almost anyone can attest to, is a rarity. My personal favorite is ""In Your Wildest Dreams"". The song absolutely sizzles!! This CD is, beyond any doubt, SIMPLY THE BEST!"
5,happy with purchase,My 2 & 4 year old girls have fun with this. We got a shopping cart so they could play store.
2,Interested in the bar code reader?,"My girl was really dissappointed because she was hoping to use the bar code stickers and then read them while ringing up, but it is so hard to use. We have to try a lot and sometimes it reads it but after a lot of attempts. Most of the time it doesn't read them... If you don't care about the bar codes it is OK."
2,A little disappointed,"My 8 year old daughter was very excited about this register; UNTIL she tried opening the cash drawer!!!! All of the buttons seem to be working EXCEPT for the one that is supposed to release the cash drawer... For right now, I can forcefully push the button down and make it open... but, once that button completely gives out..... we will have to pry the drawer open... or break the latch that is inside and manually open and close the door ourselves!! :( She enjoys everything else about the cash register... :)"
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"This cash register has been on my daughters want-list for months! When Christmas rolled around, I went ahead and purchased it from Future Memories. She was thrilled to receive it! Unfortunately, the scanner on the register stopped working within the first 30 minutes of opening the package. After contacting customer service several times and trying to speak with a manager, I was told that the register could NOT be replaced since it had been opened. After reading several of the other reviews, I see Im not the only one who has experienced problems with this $50 WASTE of $!!!! If I had purchased this from a large retail outlet like Toys R Us, Target, or Walmart, they would have gladly replaced the defective register with one that worked. Lesson learned!"
3,Not as fancy as I thought,"This looked like it was a really nice set with fancy detailed handles. They were okay, but the server spatula had a scratch on it and was not at an angle that made it work well for serving cake."
3,I would be unlikely to purchase this again,"The book is not without merit, however, many of the ideas and concepts are common sense and the rest are readily searchable. If you completely lack oral argument skills this book could assist you but was of little to no help to me."
4,A garage-revival masterpiece,"""Sound of Confusion"" offers all that every (neo)psychedelia and garage revival wants to hear: hypnotic tracks full of fuzzy one-or-two-chord guitars and a repetitive rhythm section that creates and stratospheric experience into the listener head.Highly influenced by The Stooges and The 13th Floor Elevators (this album includes Little Doll and Rollercoaster), Spacemen 3's debut album is, I'm sure, a lesson of crazy music."
4,Losing Touch With my Mind,"This is the best starting point for those wishing to find the fuzzy, drugged out, blissful noise blues that is Spacemen 3. ""Losing Touch With my mind"" is my favorite shoegazer anthem with its fried lyrics, wall of noise, and old school blues guitar riff dragging the song along. The cd is worth the price for this song alone! ""Hey man"" and a cover of the Stooges drone classic ""Little doll"" show the Spacemen's soul side and the noisy jangle of ""Mary Anne"" is addictive. ""Rollercoaster"" and ""O.D. catastrophe"" are extended dronefests (the latter of which is a take on the Stooges ""TV Eye"", punctuated with noisy guitar squalls, and druggy lyrics. Personally, I like the version of ""2:35"" on For All The F#*$ed Up Children, but the 2 included here are alright and represent a certain point in the bands development of their sound. Loose and stoned fun!"
4,Work just fine,"I purchased three to keep at home at work and in the car for my iphone. They all seem to work just fine, no complaints. I love being able to snap them up and avoid tangled cords. The cord that came with the iphone was too short so these are a great alternative at an unbeatable price. We'll see how they stand up over time."
3,Flimsy and unreliable.,"Considering the price, this product will serve you well in a pinch, but it does not provide a reliable connection. The iPod/iPhone connector appears to be slightly undersized. Each time I connect my iPhone, I have to jiggle the connector a little to get my iPhone to recognize that it's there and it does not always stay connected, unless you stay completely still. You will not these problems with original Apple connectors.When it is connected, it seems to work well, but I do feel like I need to keep checking it.The fact that it is retractable is a cool feature. However, I would rather carry around a full-length cable than one that doesn't stay connected."
3,"Good price point, bad strain relief","I've been using one of these cables in my car for about a year now. It works well, except that the strain relief at the iPod connector end is lacking. Lately, the cable jacket has worn through at the iPod connector, and there's now exposed wire. The cable still works for now, but will probably fail after a couple more bending cycles. It's otherwise a fine adapter."
4,"Good, But Could Have Been Better","I picked this up on impulse in a bookstore. I was leaving for Russia and I knew it would be a while before I could get more books in English. I think the story would have been better if it had focused more on the struggles to invent rather than the unrequited love story. I am assuming most of the story is completely invented as well as most of the main characters. Of course Louis Daguerre was a real person, but I guess Chloe and Isobel are invented. It seems way too much of a coincidence that Daguerre's nude model turns out to be the daughter of his long lost love, but I guess the rest of the story wouldn't happen otherwise. This was a mildly entertaining read, but I hope Smith will do better in his next book."
4,Wonderful Historical Fiction,"The 1st 40 to 50 pages of this novel were pretty slow. I almost gave up reading this novel because it started off so slowly... I'm glad I didn't though because it ended up being a very fascinating novel that I couldn't put down. You don't have to be a photography fan or know much about Louis Daguerre to enjoy this book.What I liked most about this novel was the story telling done by Dominica Smith. The novel opens as Louis Daguerre is an old man and going mad due to inhaling mercury vapors from all the daguerreotypes he has done during his lifetime. Daguerre thinks the world is coming to an end, so sets about taking his last 10 great pictures before the world ends with the help of a friend. From there we learn about Daguerre's life, where he grew up, his career, the love of his life who spurned him, but whom he seeks out to see one last time before the world ends.... and so on.This book is truly a wonderful; read."
4,Great for historical fiction fans,"I've always been a fan of those books that neatly blend truth and fiction flawlessly. Smith has done just that. He has taken a story of the father of photography and brought it to life in a heartbreaking way. Unrequited love and obsessions are at the center of this novel. The character Deguerre is quite believable and sympathetic. The woman Isobel that he spends his life thinking about is, well, for lack of a better word, flawed. But this is part of what makes their relationship so interesting. Love is not always roses and ""happily ever after,"" and that is okay with this reader. ""Mercury Visions"" would make a beautiful movie: the scenery, the romantic tension, the characters... all described by Smith in such a way as to be felt and seen already. Just insert actors, and voila! Of course, Hollywood has a way of flubbing this process up, so perhaps it is best to just take this book as it is: you won't be disappointed..."
3,"Easy there, fellas.","This book is very appealing upon the first read. A white author writing with authority on a black art form, how empowering for all us crackas! Slow down. Upski is a talented writer and offers an interesting perspective on a subject that receives very little attention, but whites would do well to put a lid on the corny hip hop vs. rap, Four Elements of the Temple of Hip Hop type of babble. I've met Upski several times, and he's even admitted to me that Bomb the Suburbs is essentially a white author writing what he thinks Blacks want to hear.Read his second book, No More Prisons, for a more balanced and less ""desperate to be down"" narrative on the state of hip hop. He matures greatly between the two books."
3,east side kids,The quality of these DVDs arent the best but its great to see (The boys) any time i want .It brings me back to those sunday mornings on channel 9 while my mom was cookin the macaroni and meatballs with her home made sauce.Between the shows and the smell of my moms cookin those were some of the best times of my life.I just wish they would put the Bowery Boys series on dvd so I could order them to.They were the best I use to feel like i was sitting in Louie's Sweet Shop with the Bowery Boys.
5,Best Ever,This is the best sports almanac you'll ever find! It is full of interesting facts about every sport and all the information you'll ever want to know. I highly reccomend this book to anyone who likes sports.
4,Superior,"Another magnificent gift from BIS to music lovers. Recommended without reservation. Excellent recording, too."
4,Very useful book,"Learning about the unique characteristics of the Rhodesian was fabulous. It was very insightful for me as a first time dog owner, and in particular a first time Rhodesian Ridgeback owner! General training tips at the end of the book were very useful."
1,backordered,ordered feb 3 just now notified backordered til april bad customer service what good are snowpants going to be in april and why did it take almost two weeks to inform me of this
4,It was great! None of my friends knew the answers.,"It was an awesome book. The questions really were the hardest questions that I've ever tried to answer, and being a die hard Tiger fan I know the tragedy of disapppointment (We haven't been decent since 1993). Read the book it's sweet!"
2,Couldn't stand the wind,"There was some strong winds one day and the insert flew out. Now, it's hard to find a new insert. This item is good when in a non-hostile environment."
5,Excellent romance novel,"This is one of the most romantic novels that I have read. My favorite part is the climax at the end of the novel. I must say that this is one of Howard's best work. Her writing is splendid. The climax at the end will have you sighing over and over again with how romantic it is. Rule (the male figure) is absolutely incredible. He is not the typical romance male figure that is often seen in most novels. He is controlling, dominate, and virile, yet at the same time, he is weak and desperately in love with Cathryn.I recommend this book to all romance readers. Reading Howard's writing is completely different from just knowing what happens in the story. I must say that this is one of the best romances I have read. The climax is heart-breaking, it leaves your heart all tangled up and aching inside."
2,Reprint of early Howard; not one of her best,"Ignore the listed publication date-this is a reprint from 1983, not a new story. I love Linda Howard's more recent books, but her early stories are formulaic, have nonsensical plot lines, and unbelievable character behavior. This one is boring and the characters are poorly developed. Spare yourself--read something she's written in the last 5 or 8 years."
1,I didn't like it,"Now, I read the old version, the one written in the 80's so maybe Ms. Howard has changed it since then, and maybe it's not so terrible anymore. But, God!He interferes in her life, cancels her date with another guy (even though he has shown no interest in her so far), then, when she is reasonably upset about it, he hauls her into another room, pulls down her pants, flips her over his knee and gives her, and I quote, ""the spanking of her life.""I don't need a romatic hero, I don't even need one whose always very nice, but I draw the line at physically hitting a woman. It's a no. It's wrong, and these old romances seem to give women the idea that its romantic or acceptable. It isn't, ever, ok for a man to lay a hand on a woman.No, I'm not a femenist, I like a macho man's man as much as the next girl and Ms. Howard is normally a great writer who can deliver a tough guy who still doesn't actually physically hurt the heroine. I just don't know why this book is so bad."
2,Weak,"I'm sorry I bought this one. Weak premise, weak plot, weak character development- it's hard to remember much about the story. Not a memorable or exciting novel. I remember wishing it would end early. My 2 stars are generous."
1,not his best work,I started reading this book hoping it would as good as his other books have been in the past. I was wrong it was boring from the first page I couldn't get into it. David Baldacci usually writes a good supenseful book that I can't put down . This book was a disapointment to me.
1,Saving Faith,I could not believe how boring and predictable this book was. One was never sure what it was that sent Faith to the FBI. Do not waste your time on this book. How did anyone ever publish this book. I could guess what the next line was before I read it. Give a new author a chance.
3,"Fast, Slow, Predictable","Saving Faith starts out fast paced with many (almost too many) characters introduced lickity split. Once you have figured out many of the players, you get pulled into the action of Lee and Faith. Lee Adams, a private investigator with a less than stellar private life, is hired anonymously to follow Faith Lockhart. Faith, who works for manipulative lobbyist Danny Buchanon, is getting ready to tell the FBI everything she knows about her boss. The next thing you know, an FBI agent is dead and Faith and Lee are running for their lives!The chase ensues and the plot slows down a bit. The relationship has time to develop between Lee and Faith and other minor and key players.Finally, the CIA and FBI pick up the pace of the plot a bit....but alas the story falls victim to a very predictable ending.Baldacci is a good author and the writing in this book is good, it just lacked the pace I am used to in a Baldacci book."
3,Blended Genre Novel: Romance with Thriller,"If Baldacci were a woman writer, you probably would find this novel categorized as romantic suspense. Ironically,although he is known as a thriller writer, in this novel he succeeds better with the romantic aspects. The plot line you've seen before. The FBI is interviewing and protecting a witness, Faith, when all of a sudden, she almost gets killed and her protector agent does get killed. She is saved by a private investigator who becomes her love interest. They keep one step ahead of both the FBI and CIA. The FBI wants them alive but a honcho at the CIA wants them dead. This CIA man is such a cliche in every respect as a villain that he almost ruins the book. Nonetheless, this novel moves right along and is diverting entertainment that you will forget as soon as you read the last page."
3,"Alright, but not my style","Saving Faith was definatly a great book towards the end. Things picked up the pace and everything was finally making some sense. The beginning, however, seemed slow to me and maybe it's because this isn't the usual type of book that I read. I'm not so interested in the political type books. It did eventually get better though and I've definately read worse."
2,Not as Strong as Other Baldacci Novels,"""Saving Faith"" can be described in one word--predictable. This book seemed to go on forever with relatively no excitement. After getting off to a quick start, Baldacci lets the rest of the book stumble over what is supposed to be suspense. When something did happen, you already guessed it about fifty pages ago. Reading it becomes more like a job instead of enjoyment. I was very dissapointed with the book, especially after reading ""Absolute Power"" and ""The Winner"". I suggest reading those before you try this one. They are much more surprising and entertaining.Just a hint--read the first fifty pages. Then skip to about page 350 for the suspense to pick back up again. You will not miss anything and the book will be more enjoyable."
2,"It takes ""Faith"" to finish this book","David Baldacci's latest is one big disappointment. I have read all the others, but this one isn't even close to being in their league. The plot is thin, the characters are not very believeable and the result is contrived. I hope the next one finds him returning to a better work, but I will check it out before I just buy it on his up 'til now well deserved reputation."
3,my review,"A PI finds himself immersed in a plot involving not only the FBI but also de CIA. At the center of everything is a woman he was charged to follow.The central plot is very interesting and follows through until the end. The characters are real and you indentify very well with each of them.This author has always written good ""detective"" novels and this is certainly no exception.Good read!"
2,Book Purchase,Disappointed - the book that was delivered was the large type for easier reading format and I did not know that is what I purchased. I am sure it stated such somewhere but apparently is wasn't too obvious as I wouldn't have purchased the book it I had know.
2,Stilted and Forced,"I've enjoyed his previous books, but this one seems forced, like he needed to quickly produce something to meet a deadline. The plot wasn't very interesting, the characters never really captured me, and the whole FBI vs. CIA theme was way overblown."
2,Trashy and forgettable,"Ever had a book hangover? You know the feeling that you get when you've read a brilliant book and you can't get it out of your head? OK, well you won't have to worry about it with Saving Faith. It's about a woman named Faith and a guy called Lee and the CIA and FBI and it's set in Washington and people get killed and rescued and shot and stuff. I read it in 24 hours, and beyond that description all I can say is I wish I knew what happened to the dog. Did the FBI hurt it when they stormed the house???? If you're doing a last minute trawl through an airport book store to find a book, sure, grab this one. If you've got time, keep looking."
3,Absolute - lack of - power,"This book's plot revs into high gear when a person who has just performed a B&E for pay witnesses a murder and has to go on the lam from high level government powers who want to kill him to cover up their crime. If you think this sounds like Baldacci's first big hit, Absolute Power, you are absolutely right. When writers start having to recycle their own old plots you can rest assured that there is little of interest left for a reader. If you have not read Absolute Power, then this book might work for you. Everything is somewhat predictable but most of us like a certain level of confirmed expectation in thrillers. But if you want anything fresh or original, this book is not for you."
2,Saving Faith,"A little ""faith' is needed to stick with this book. But, give it to page 50 and the plot begins to come together. There are more initials...CIA, DDO, FBI, CTC, PAC, etc. in the first few chapters, than Liz Taylor's monogrammed towels. The plot coasts along, in predictable hate/love/hate/love fashion, until someone has a close call with death. The punchline ending is the best part of Baldacci's talent, as it features a few surprises. The ""bad guys"" are revealed and everyone lives happily ever after, under the safe umbrella of some ""initials""."
3,Really For Beginners,This is really for beginners. If you never did line dancing this product is for you.
3,Pricy,"You get very basic lessons on five kinds of line dances and I would value this DVD at about $12. If they would have added a dance session for every kind of dance, I would have felt like I got my money's worth. By dance session, I mean that they could have videoed people actually using the steps so you could dance along. Also, the music used was jazzy instead of country - what's up with that?"
4,I Can Do It!,"Having attended numerous weddings and parties and watching The Electric Slide from the sidelines, Shawn Trautman has made it possible for me to join the fun. His Line Dancing video is perfect for someone with no experience-he demonstrates and describes each step clearly. Perfect for the novice."
5,Line Dance 101,"My mom and I love this one. I am 50 and she is 69. This is how we learned our 1st Line Dance. My mom had not been out to a nightclub since her early 20's. She now goes out with me and my husband about once a month to line dance. We couldn't pick it up in the clubs because they go to fast. You can truely take your time and learn each one. Then when we were comfortable we started going out. Shawn can teach old dogs new tricks. Our favorite's are: Electric Slide to ""Mustang Sally"", Slappin leather to ""Reagae Cowboy"", and Cotton Eyed Joe (same song). PS It's great exercise too."
4,NO gluten in this delicious product,This is easy to make in just a few minutes. It is difficult to find Hollandaise sauce without gluten. I completely recommend this product.I use gluten free english muffins to enjoy eggs benedict at home.
5,essential,"For anyone interested in poetry, not just contemporary poetry, but the history of poetry, this book is absolutely essential. Mercy Seat covers almost the entire span of Dubie's career. For whatever reason his first book, Alehouse Sonnets, is absent from this collection. Despite this the reader is given a very valuable gift.Dubie speaks with a voice that is both ancient and new. It's as if he has always been here, yet just arrived. Beyond these comments though let the book speak for itself."
1,not so good,A lot of mistakes in the CD's. Not consistent how the learning is done. Would not pay for the product(group again)
2,Yet another title I purchased in order to see Margot Kidder naked...,"And she does go skinny-dipping in a lake at one point. Sadly, the rest of the movie concerns Kidder diddling around with two complete putzes / best friends. Very slow moving, and feels like a Lifetime Movie before the Lifetime Network even existed."
5,"Throw away your chef knife, this is the one you need","I've replaced my chef knife with this santoku knife. It is so much easier to handle. It's made for right handers, so my wife who is a southpaw doesn't use it. Not that it matters to me, I want it all for myself anyhow. It's the one knife I reach for when I'm dicing up vegatables and doing rough cuts of meat."
2,Bad aftertaste,"I guess I'm in the minority in thinking that these tortillas taste lousy. They have a certain ""dirt"" aftertaste. I tried eating them for two meals, thinking I would acquire a taste for them after the first meal, but I just couldn't. In fact, they ruined any wrap I made so that I was left dissatisfied with my meal. I'm a calorie counter, so I'm always looking for calorie ""bargains,"" but I would rather have a piece of regular bread or another goodtasting tortilla for 100 calories than eat this one for 60."
2,Let it be about Marsden Hartley,"This film has some value with information about Marsden Hartley, the man and the artist. But unfortunately the huge ego of the filmmaker gets in the way. Somehow the film ends up being about him and not the artist. Since he directed the film, he has given himself ample camera time. The camera stays focused on the filmmaker as he lectures the audience (sometimes for several long minutes!). Instead, we could have seen more of Marsden Hartley's artwork (sadly very few of his work are shown in this film). The filmmaker should be commended for taking on the task but he ruined the film by turning it into a long lecture and making questionalbe and not very well researched pontifications. Case in point: Marsden Hartley was a Nazi Sympathizer!! If you must see this film, just rent it."
4,"A very interesting book, but not excellent.","I bought this book thinking that it would be great, I have the book ""Kindred of the East"" and I love it, my friends and I really love this game and when I saw the title of this book I thoght ""Great, Mage in the East, not only the Akashic Brotherhood exists in this game, so I bought it. I have to say that it is really interesting, but some parts are really boring and it could be a bit more complete."
1,WORST GAME EVER!,"One star is too much for this game. I wish I could give it zero stars.The graphics are terrible, the controls are sloppy, and the missions make no sense.I bought this game used for less than $5, and I still felt ripped off!"
3,"Ok, but nothing spectacular","I will be roasted for this review, but I write on. Chris Cunningham has always been one of my favorite MV directors, from ""Second Bad Vilbel"" for Autechre to ""Frozen"" for Madonna. I could always expect good things from Chris. With that in mind, I saw this video back in 99, when the song was on the Stigmata soundtrack. I was puzzled after I watched it, it was very very strange to be sure. But I just found it pointless, and I didn't appreciate the all too obvious visual metaphors for sex. I found those to be a little forced and awkward. The song is fantastic, as is most from Miss G, so I can't fault that. The video is creative, but I don't watch it over and over so I guess the dvd was a waste of money, and that's all there is to it."
2,A waste of time,"""Relationship Tightrope"" sounds pretty good from its description, but really, it's kind of a waste of time. It's a betting game where you use little sticks as poker chips to gain balance in a relationship. The problem is that the game is very low on strategy and its theme is terribly applied. Why would you make a three player game about relationships unless you're into threesomes? Really, the game consists of number cards, and number cards to bet against. That's it. Look up the rules and make your own copy with poker chips, except make yours with a better theme. The worst part is that the game is so cheap I have no idea how I'm going to get rid of it."
1,Not a good reflexology learning source at all,"This was a waste of my time and money, not a good reflexology learning source at all. I wish there a way I can return it. I will not recommend this DVD to any people."
4,Hansel and Gretel,I got this for a little 3 yr old girl. She loves to have me or my wife read it to her. The pictures are fairly scary and Grimms appearing. A well done and fun little paperback.
3,"Tide Is A Favorite of Mine, But Not This One--too much scent of Cedar and Menthol!","I usually love Tide, but this one didn't take stains out of whites very well and it has a strong odor of cedar and menthol. If you like those scents, it may work for you, but it failed my stained sock test.The scent is very, very strong. I don't smell it on the towels and some items, but I am rewashing everything that gets close to my nose, things I sleep in or on, etc.The scent reminds me of cedar and menthol.I'll be using the rest of the bottle for things that don't come close to my face.Tide is still a favorite of mine. I'll just make sure never to choose this particular version of it again."
4,I can't believe this didn't sell better.,"I first saw this photo viewer in Parade magazine and I was excited about finally being able to share my digital photos in a slide show format. Problem was, I never saw it for sale anywhere. And then while researching gifts for my wife, I found it at a deep-discount website for less than a quarter of its original price. I ordered one for her birthday, and as soon as we got it hooked to the television and started looking at the pictures, we were thrilled. Even the pictures from my old Kodak DC 25 looked great on the television screen. The software is easy to figure out, and although it takes a little while to make the albums, it's more than worth it. I would recommend this item to anyone with a digital camera."
3,Not for beginners,"I don't know any German and I am really struggling with these CD's. They don't give you any instructions on which CD's to use first. I installed the beginner software and tried that first - I couldn't understand most of what they presented. Then I listened to the audio CD's (there are three, each with different content,) and that helped a little. The audio CD's are more helpful and I think you're actually supposed to listen to those first before trying the software. I hope to use this software when I become a little bit more familiar with German."
4,Wonderful Saturday matinee fun,"The first hour is pure fun, the action has all the wit and humor of Raiders or Last Crusade, with a wonderful contrast between Young Indy and the much older soldiers.The second continues all of the wit and humor, yet adds a thoughtful look at Indy's search for father figures to replace his own estranged father, Prof Henry Jones Sr.Quick, some lead a crusade to persuade Viacom (Paramount's parent company) that either of their networks CBS or UPN needs to make more Young Indy movies! We'll all be right behind you!"
2,Faulty piece of ...,"I rented the Thing thinking it would be awesome. I liked it first time. Then i saw the flaw. It was like a ... Jackie Chan movie. The characters mouths would move but nothing would come out. 5 seconds later they would start talking and they couldn't finish.Example The black guy in the first level Said Chik-Chik(the gun), I'm locked cocked and ready to make ... dead. in the one i got his mouth started moving nothing would come out then 5 seconds later Chik-Chik i'm locked cocked and ready to make ...-and then it just cut away. Thats what it did with the ...medic in the first level also."
5,Admirable...a holiday (in its original meaning) for...,"the senses and the intellect alike. Once again, I realized how rare and precious good music is... turning away from PJ Harvey, Bjoerk and U2, I ran into this treasure. Savina Yannatou sings not only in Greek, but also in Turkish, Arabic, Ladino, Spanish, Sardinian, Corsican, Provancal, Hebrew, Albanian and Syriac! Her voice is pristine and almost too beautiful. The last song is particularly interesting, being a mixture of a Thracian mourning song for the lost Constantinople and a North African love song in Arabic. Its innovative spirit reminds me of Enrique Morente's version of a poem by San Juan de la Cruz (embellished with Le mystere des voix Bulgares)."
5,Damn Good Stuff,"I don't own this actual CD but have, or have heard, most of these songs and I love them all. Cradle of Filth is a badass band. Pick this CD up if you are new to them, and have yet to be defiled by their Supreme Vampyric Darkness!!"
5,Great Symphonic dark metal!,"This is a great ""best hits"" collection by COF. While not a very heavy mix of music like Moribid Angel, DArkthrone, Emeperor or Soilwork, it is a very creepy mix, and once the awsome lyrics are understood through the chilling vocals, you truly get to appreciate the depth and erotica the band portrays in its album."
2,"Old School Fun, Not for Xbox!!","This game would have been great for the Atari game system, but for what Xbox can do it sux. The graphics are cheasy. There is a water like ripple going down the screen and it's on all the copies.Also the fighting controls in the crouching position are difficult to use. Save your money or buy something else."
2,Worth Renting IF You are a Bruce fan....don't buy,"See I'm gonna be honest, the controls were not too bad. But the main thing about it is the gameplay/story line. There is not much of a sensible story to the game and you have to BUY MOVES which is really stupid/unreasonable. Also you just keep fighting about 4 chinese guys every 20 feet and then have ONE guy thats suppose to be the boss that looks just like the rest (of the other people) they got different clothes/looks and all that but they all look just like everyday human beeings you see on the street, so it's kinda repetitive. If you LOVE BRUCE LEE this game is worth renting but don't buy plus the levels are not all that interactive!"
1,Has Linda Howard run out of NEW things to write?,"I can't understand why Linda Howard is reissuing her earlier work? 1) It's not good. and 2) These stories DO NOT hold up over time. I got through the first 67 pages, and had to stop reading it because I kept rolling my eyes. Dialogue and characters are vapid. Just couldn't finish it."
1,Bad on many levels,"This is a re-issue of one of Howard's earliest paperback books, and should have been clearly indicated as such before readers pay the very high hardback price. A cheat on that level, and a really bad book besides. While I vastly prefer Howard's older style of writing, she hadn't yet put together her signature elements of alpha male/woman who softens him in any believable or even enjoyable way. These characters are cringe-worthy: the ""hero"" is arrogant, obnoxious, mean and dated in style, verging on sadistic. The heroine is just too cutesy and wide-eyed innocent to be either engaging or even likeable. The two together strain credulity and the outdated plot makes it worse.This is a book that should have been left decently buried as a weak effort in Howard's evolution, not put before the current buying public in hopes that they won't notice it's old and shell out a price that is 4 or 5 times what the book originally cost. Don't be fooled."
2,Not up to par.,"I'm a huge Linda Howard fan, but this early effort is clearly not her best work. The characters are one dimensional and the plot is too obvious. Brett is a particularly unappealing hero. I have no idea what the heroine was supposedly attracted to. The one thing I did like about the book was the emotional reunion between the two leads where they try to figure out how to resume a their relationship despite their mistrust and guilt. This intense scene is indicative of some of Howard's better work. Basically, this is a semi-tolerable read if you are in serious Howard withdrawal, but most readers would be better served by picking one of her more mature works."
1,Yet another disappointment...,"Thankfully I've been fooled by publishers enough in the past to check the reviews first before I purchase books by some of my favorite romance authors. Publishers will keep doing this as long as there are people out there who will click buy without researching (and who should have to?!). The real thing that grated was the fact that Amazon sent this to me in an email titled ""Linda Howard's new book"" ...there's no need to lie, Amazon. If you were lied to, you should make the publisher aware that your customers don't appreciate this duplicity and get them to stop. Otherwise you're just as guilty."
1,Shame on Amazon,"Thankfully I recognized the text of the story. At first, since Amazon said it was a new book, I thought it was a continuation of Brett and Tessa's story. Why would anyone re-release a paperback into a hardcover? How many people were taken in by it? Shame on Linda Howard, shame on the publishers and shame on Amazon for marketing a book in such a manner. This is not good marketing, and from here on ANY Linda Howard books are suspect. It makes me suspect Amazon as well!!"
3,Sharp but chips easily,"I bought this knife about 6 months ago and have been using it with care. Honed it about three times. It slices thru tomatoes like warm butter. But the tip is now a little bent and I notice small chips on the side after honing. I am going to send it back to Shun for service, but I much prefer my other Shuns; the 7"" Santoku and the paring knife."
2,Can't Decide What to Be,"The ""Brothers Bloom"" has a great cast and fine acting.It has lush, amazingly varied scenery--St. Petersburg, Prague, Mexico, Montenegro, Japan, etc.It has decent direction.But it doesn't work. The problem is the writing. The movie can't decide whether to be a Romantic Comedy, a Romantic Tragedy, a Caper movie, a Rival Brothers movie, a Character Study, or any of several other things.It ends up trying to do all these things, and doing them all badly.Throwing in quirky characters helps, but only temporarily.Ultimately, the movie lacks energy. Lacks tension. Lacks conflict. Lacks suspense. Lacks coherence.It has lots of ideas, lots of (paper-thin) plot, lots of beauty, even lots of interesting lines, but none of these work together.Pity.It is no accident that by far the most interesting character is Bang Bang--who has no lines.Without a coherent script, no movie can succeed."
5,Brilliant!,"I'm surprised this movie got so many one star reviews, so I had to put my two cents in. I LOVED this movie, yes it does a lot of different things but to me, that is what makes it stand out from being a tired rehash of the same old plot lines. It's funny, loving, quirky, brotherly, and not what you thought it would be by the end. It's worth a second viewing after seeing the ending to help pull everything together, but it's just a great movie.Tortured Bloom who wants to be normal, his brother Stephen who has tried to write a life for him to live, conning people and traveling the world. There are beautiful backgrounds, explosions, seedy rival con men...It's quirky definitely, but it is worth watching.When I go in to a movie, I want to be entertained, to be pulled from my own life for a little while. The Brothers Bloom delivers on that. It's fun. Be open minded and take it for what it is....An unusual, amusing, thrill ride that will keep you guessing!"
1,Movie was just hard to watch,"Rented this movie, thankfully I rented it! I'm wondering why its coming out on Bluray way after the regular dvd format. Anyway, the movie tries way too hard to be smart, and some of it was creative, but it just lacked that one important thing that keeps the audience interested: Entertainment! Its a shame, I all three actors, but just the way the movie did not flow right, trying to be funny in places when it was not, it was just downright boring. I'll be honest, I thought it was so bad I didn't finish it.It did however remind me of an older movie about two con artists, which was funny and entertaining, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, starring Steve Martin and Michael Caine. I do not recommend the Brothers Bloom movie."
3,"Interesting ideas though broadly derivative, and flat characters","Perhaps I should have been warned by the blurbs that made comparison to Tom Clancy. Although there are interesting ideas here about the architecture of alien beings (or artifacts of those beings, unclear by the end of the book that is clearly going to be at least a trilogy, alas), they are chopped by by distracting conversations among two-dimensional characters that when they are not engaing in full industrial-aerospatial-complex-speak come off as unintended self-satyrical versions of what the author believes is contemporary conversational idiom.Nonetheless, it was a page turner (made faster by the dialogue that was eminently skippable) and somewhat plausible version of an invasion scenario. However, the lack of character development and human interest do not make it likely that I will want to turn the pages of the next installment in this series."
1,"Bad, just plain bad.","Barely any plot,no character development, an overuse of meaningless technical terms , a very USA centric book that seems to be devoid of any knowledge of anything outside the USA.I skimmed the last 1/3 of the book but the end was just as bad as all the rest.Dont bother to read it."
2,"Old, dated, and of little use to me","The alleged ""201 Killer Cover Letters"" were written in 1995 according to the enclosed disk and are not very professional in my opinion. They are of little use in today's job market, again in my opinion.The front cover claims one is able to ""downplay your weaknesses"" by adhering to the principles in this book. One of my weaknesses was purchasing this book in the first place."
4,Take a Thief,"Skif was a thief, and a herald, the first thief-herald, But he wasn't always a thief-herald, Take a thief by Mercedes Lackey, is the story of how Skif became a thief-herald. I didn't find this to be one of Mercedes best books, However I enjoyed this book very much. on a scale of 1 to 5 I would give this book a 4"
3,solid read,"I have always liked Skiff and this book went a ways toward rounding him out more for me. Compared to the book about Lavan Firestorm, this was a significant improvement. The story was well done and did not have the rushed feel of the previously mentioned book. I also thought the character developement was pretty good. I love adolescent angst as much as the next fantasy reader but occasionally it can be overdone and it was refreshing to see a very resiliant non-angsty character in this story. I think you will enjoy it."
4,Take a Thief,"I've only read 5 of Lackey's novels - The Heralds of Valdemar trilogy, Winds of Fate, and Take a Thief, but I can say I didn't like TAT as much as the rest. While Skif is an orphan in Haven's slums, he gets off a lot easier than other children in his situation - he meets a member of a gang of ""honorable"" thieves, who take him in and teach him the art of pickpocketing and cat burglary. Towards the end half of the book, Skif is Chosen by Cymry and taken to the Collegium. The plot is slightly confusing and thin, and what is with Alberich's speech? He does not talk like that in the Arrows books. Stay consistent to your characters, please!Anyway, this isn't the best of Lackey's novels, for sure. If you're a diehard Valdemar fan and like Skif, then read it, but don't start out with this one. Read one of the better ones, like the Arrow books or the Mage Winds."
2,"Excellent idea, terrible execution","It's good that Ms. Lackey finally got around to giving us some background on Skif - one of the more interesting peripheral characters in many of the other Valdemar books. And it's very nice that she's quit writing trilogies. However this book is full of inconsistencies which will annoy most fans.In ""Arrows of the Queen"", the Holderkin who are part of Valdemar keep their women uneducated. This is in direct conflict with ""Take a Thief"" when schooling is mandatory for all children.In ""The Last Herald-Mage"", Taver is the Companion of the King's Own. In ""Brightly Burning"", Rolan is the King's Own Companion. But in ""Take a Thief"", Skif is told that Taver was Talimir's Companion and was killed in the Tedrel Wars. Rolan was his replacement.These should have been caught and dealt with.Finally, I find the blatant egotism in writing herself a part in her own books to be a mark of unacceptable arrogance."
1,Worst Software I have ever bought,"The only thing good about this software is that it can be held up as an example of how not to design user interfaces and how not to teach a language.The user interfaces is slow, frustrating to use, non-intuitive, and looks like something you'd expect to see on an Apple II.The software itself consists mainly of drills with no teaching.... which is essentially useless if you have no prior experience with the language. Forget learning grammar or anything with this crap.I've gone with the Pimseleur Level 1 & 2 courses...much more expensive but worth it."
2,save your money,"The only redeeming item in this cd set is the Blackbelt software- a mahjong game that will allow you to memorize kana and some kanji. However, you can get this software independently from blackbeltlanguage. It seems that the company who made this product just put together a bunch of junk and packaged it as education software. The other CDs are absolutely worthless. You will not learn a thing from them."
3,Beware,"The software works fine with my ETX90EC telescope. The only complaint I have is that seller (Ace Photo Digital) sent me a ""Limited Edition"" (the imaging options were all disabled) which is not how the item was listed. Buyer beware; make sure you explicitly ask if you're getting full or the limited version. I have since ordered the full version from another seller."
1,Out of date.,This product uses a cable that is out of date with todays computers.Needs to be a USB not the old serial port on old computers.I don't think any manufactures put these ports on their models anymore.Software needs to be more interactive.
1,Works now and then,This microphone only works some of the time. And it is too close to the headphone jack and interferred with them working properly. I am sending this back and getting a refund
4,great for older generation iPods,but if you have a touch iPod/iPhone it won't work--the new ones come with the built-in voice memo function anyway.
4,Sun Runner' Fire,I enjoyed this. I have like Melanie Rawn books. I would like to know what happen to The Captal' Tower.
2,Yawn,"Okay I found this series so far to be incredably boring. None of the characters were really interesting and rather one diminsional. Rohans character was way too good and faultless it seemed.I couldn't stand the fact that every female in this book seemed to be blessed with red hair while living in a dessert. As a matter of fact the dessert would have darker skinned individuals not redheads or blondes with fair skin because of the heat of course, duh.Every female and male character seemed to be the virtualy the same, Sioned and Sionell as an example. The only character in this whole series I really liked was Andry because his character seemed to be developed properly unlike Pol's. Also Andry in my opinion unlike many of the other characters had faults, besides Pol's indifference towards Sionell not that I could blame the guy.Anyway don't waste your money on this series just go and get it from the libary if your interested in reading it."
2,Not Sandra's Best,Ms. Brown has written better romance novels. Don't give up on her if this was your first Sandra book.The feeble female lead struggles with a 15-year crush that walks back into her life. The smug male lead acts like a jerk through most of the novel. The romance scenes grapple to muster up passion but fall short. Both of the main characters bothered me; my favorite character was the 17-year old.A quick read...about 4 hours (with interruptions) for me...but probably not worth it.
3,Just ok...,The book was ok but it had the exact ending I suspected all along. It was a little disappointing.
3,Not overly thrilled.,"Sandra Brown is one of my favorite authors. I'm sure the fact that this book is 20 years old explains some of the problems I had with it. I found Law arrogant, self-centered & thoughtless. He took over David's life without consulting Marnie on anything. He ignored the fact that she had spent 16 years being a wonderful mother to David and because of Law's lack of compassion he hurt her repeatedly & deeply. He also had a lot of nerve saying his lifestyle was ""normal"" when in fact, even though I am a liberal person, I thought it largely immoral & careless.I found it unrealistic that everything turned a 180 in the last few pages & that Marnie forgave him, without hesitation, for all the pain he caused her. But as I said Sandra Brown is a favorite & one fair book doesn't change that."
2,couldn't finish it,"While Stephen King's ""It"" is absorbing from the first paragraph, I found myself having to put too much effort into enjoying this book. While King beautifully develops his characters and makes the reader interested in the everyday lives of the children of the book, Rollo simply can't seem to match up. The parts that I read weren't SCARY per say, they were disturbing in a disgusting way. Somehow King has his ""monster"" horrendously kill a cute little boy and it isn't disgusting, but Rollo has his kill a baby and it IS disgusting. Don't ask me what the missing element is to Rollo's novel, because I can't put my finger on it.I recommend Joe Hill's ""Heart Shaped Box"" instead. Excellent read, I guarantee that you will be creeped out by just reading the description."
1,Nearly Expired,Just got my box of packets 4-6-12. All with an expiration date of 6-12. Don't buy unless you plan to cut yourself 10 times in the next 2 months.
3,Ok,The idea is great because you can have them in your purse but the little packs are not well sealed so they tend to open.
4,Yay!,"As an avid Disney fan, it's great to have a collection of all the songs that I grew up with. It keeps the inner child in me very entertained and now it's something that MY children can enjoy as well. I'm very happy with this purchase."
3,Not so interesting,"I bought this for my 3 years old and i thought it will be very interesting and attractive but i discovered that it is not. The farm activities are not interesting and they don't interact alot with animals or even nature so close so my child didn't find something attractive in this video, even the songs are not like other barney songs. I already bought him best manners DVD and that one much more attractive and interesting. However on this DVD you will find some games that may attract your child even more the video like the animals sounds."
2,"Not comfy, even for short periods of time on a carpeted floor.","I purchased this for a movie-in-the-park event. I was told to bring a ""low chair"" and thought this might suit my needs. It is really light and easy to transport. It is reasonably well made - I did not notice any loose seams or rips/tears. However, after about 20 minutes, the chair was very uncomfortable. There is very little seat padding and back support is minimal. I suppose if you are a kid or teenager, it wouldn't be as noticeable, but I'm pushing 40 and can tell you that I've sat on molded plastic seats on city buses that are at least 50 times more comfortable than this chair. I ended up folding this chair in half and sitting on it without the back support. Pretty lame. I tried using at home the other week, and it was uncomfortable even on our carpeted living room floor. This went into the Goodwill box after a few weeks. Next time I'm buying one of these in a store, where I can try it out before purchasing."
2,Would be a perfect rating but...,"I bought my 50"" version of this television in February of 2006. For 6 months, it was the best picture I had ever seen, and I bragged about my setup to everyone who came over. However, my unit is now 9 months old and I too am having the same ""burn-in"" effect in the lower right of the screen. My setup is using THX-1000 Monster component cables coming from a Denon AVR-3805 receiver.I can't believe that with the cost of this unit when compared to other models, that Sony allowed this type of defect to be proliferated in their flagship product.I too am done with Sony TVs."
2,"Okay, I guess","I saw this show live in 1991, and the only match that really grabbed me was Macho v. Warrior. The match had a great storyline, Warrior's best in ring work, and drama. The rest was really uninspired, especially the thrown together main event. Hogan v. Slaughter, well it wasn't quite what I anticipated for a main event back then. It could have been Iraqi turncoat Brooklyn Brawler v. Jingoistic jerk Hulk Hogan, because god knows Slaughter was a jobber with a one-time shot at the big time. The match was okay, but the storyline was disturbing considering actual people were getting killed in a war."
4,"good, but the main event brings it down a bit.","this wrestlmania was pretty good, not exacty top five material but still good. the rockers vs. haku and barbarian-good match, alot of high flying and close falls, and the crowd was really into this one. million dollar man vs. virgil-not a very good match, but the crowd goes nuts for piper at the end. tito santana vs. the mountie-short match, which in actuality is probably a good thing. savage vs. warrior-amazing match, and for the warrior that's like a miricale. this is also when savage makes his face return. bret hart vs. nasty boys-average match, nothing special about it. hogan vs. slaughter-boring match and there was no doubt hogan would win, mainly because his huge ego wouldnt allow a loss on the biggest ppv of the year. but back then hogan everyone was a mark for hogan, even i was,but most real wrestling fans today have no respect for hogan. these arent all the matches but there alot of the main ones."
3,WrestleMania VII,"WrestleMania VII was in many ways, the beginning of the WWF's slide, as the exploitive Gulf War angle set up a lousy Hulk Hogan vs. Sgt. Slaughter main event. However, the show stealer was the retirement match between Ultimate Warrior and Randy Savage, which was one of the best booked matches in WWF history. Warrior, who has never been a good wrestler, for some reason, really had a barnburner with Savage, as the heat and drama in that match was incredible."
1,Worst Lightscribe discs on the market!,"I've been Lightscribing for some time now, ran out of my regular brand of Verbatims, needed some discs right away, so instead of ordering online, and having to wait for the shipping, i went to my local Staples store and got these. The image on these discs are so light and faded that you can bearly tell it's there. It takes multiple repeat burns to get the image even half-way decent. Verbatim discs are WAY better and produce a much better, clearer image on the first burn.Avoid these like the plague!"
2,Beginners guide at best,"I""m dissapointed!!! this book doesn't have nearly any new or good info.I was looking for a more scientific book.There is some info but nothing I didn't already know.Skip this one unless it's used,cheap or free.I think this book is outdated, and I don't live in Brooklyn either."
4,Tom's ATV,"Tom's ATV and so far, all of the mighty world toys are great. They are detailed and come with lots of little parts. If your not organized and do not place the parts in a baggie or something similar they could be a nightmare. However it is the detail and all of the small accesories that make the tow so fun."
5,Fabulous Lilttle LED Spotlight on the Market,"This is a great LED spotlight for the money! It is amazing how far I can see with it at night. I have used it inside on two occasions when the power was out, and I simply sat it in the floor and pointed it up at the ceiling, and the entire room had a nice light. Definitely worth the money."
3,Good range of tunes.,"Note I didn't say great. If you're new to disco, then maybe this isn't the one to get first up. If you're already a fan, then you should enjoy this.I liked the 3 CD format - it''s interesting to hear how Kenny cut up the tracks on the mix cd. Then you can to the other cds with the origonal tracks to hear them in their entirety. This represents pretty good value for money all up."
1,Not what you would think,"This product was the ultimate mistake because it did not keep anything away except humans because it smells so bad as far as fending off animals I do not know any thing that this may have chased away as I watched Dogs, Cats, Coons, Possum's, and Birds approach the treated area so if you want to purchase a product to do absolutley nothing then this would be the good choice. I was forced to put at least 1 star if I could I would rate it at -5"
4,Funny,"This guy doesn't quite get life, but his logical mind makes some great observations about inconsistencies and things most of us have not noticed. What an imagination. I saw Carlin in Minneapolis in 1987. The experience was worth the money. There is no one like Carlin."
3,Victorian Internet,"Fair. Prose and layout not so clear. Would not recommend it, and change this impression after I have not read the whole book."
5,Excellent Read,"An entertaining account of the origin and evolution of telegraph technologies, including many an anecdote. A terrific read, front to back."
4,Interesting parallels between the telegraph and the Internet,"This is an interesting, well-written account of the history of the telegraph, with parallels drawn between that story and the modern-day history of the development of the Internet. Not a scientific account, but includes enough information to tell general readers how the key technologies work. Also includes entertaining anecdotes about the social changes that the new invention caused or contributed to."
2,It was not as exiting as there other mysteries.,"Most of there mysteries a on the edge of your seat can't wait, but this was just boring. I thought all there other ones were way better. That is probably why they didn't make it a book."
5,His Best Yet!,"I own all of the Tim Janis CDs and I am in love with A Thousand Summers! This makes me dream of the vacations I spend with my family on the California coast. My favorite tracks are Morro Bay and For Only A Moment...a definite necessity for any Tim Janis fan or a fan of breathtaking, relaxing music. Amazing!"
2,A Disappointment,"Unlike his recent releases, Water's Edge and Live, this album represents all that is often wrong with ""New Age"" music. There is nothing throughout this album but a collection of aimless tracks thrown together. The songs, in and of themselves, really have no point or audible climax to them. In effect, A Thousand Summers is elevator music, pure and simple.The songs are not bad, but nothing really sticks out as memorable on this album at all, even the remixes of previous songs that appear on this album are not as good as the originals. Janis has been putting out quite a bit of music lately, he might need to take more time to turn out something of better quality...because this is not up to the standards he set for himself with his better works."
4,Very well written,"This story does have some brutal violence in it,but it is there because of the nature of the subject: bigotry and oppressive racial situations. That being said, it is well written and has a wonderful economy of words and flow that kept me interested throughout. The characters are interesting and developed and made me want to see where their choices led them."
4,Good book,"I liked this a lot. The style of writing was that of a master storyteller. It kind-of reminds me of the storytelling style of Diana Gabaldon. If you like Diana Gabaldon you would like this. Maybe not vice versa though, Gabaldon is a little racy. I really enjoyed the sneak peak into the lives in the story. I did however think the ending lacked a bit of oomph. The climax was a mini-climax. I was looking for a blaze of glory or something...but I will watch this author. Great prose is still great prose."
3,"Great description of Australia, characters were lacking for me...","I liked this book, and I would probably read more from this author, BUT..... I didn't love the main characters of this book. I had wanted the book to read like an Isabel Allende Novel, who does great time period pieces and really lets you explore the place/time, etc. I have never read a book taken place in Australia before, so that was good. I didn't feel as though there was a true arc in the story. I was wonderful if Thornhill was a real character, or researched? I would have liked to learn more about the native people? Also, more about his son Dick, and his encounters with the native people. I can't imagine any woman sticking by her husband in there last settlement type place, etc. Anyway, it was an interesting read, but can't say it was my favorite."
3,Good book,Good read especially in the summer. historical fiction always makes me appreciate how difficult it was for our fore bearers.
4,River of Tears,"Kate Grenville is one of the great writers of Australia. The Secret River is a story which allows the reader to experience the harsh and spartan life of the early English settlers of Sydney and the Hawkesbury; ignorant and uneducated people who had no understanding of how to survive in their new country, and who were blind to the bush skills of the aboriginal people whos land they simply inhabited as a god given right. The book delivers compassion for the brutal treatment of the first nation people and exhausting anger at the ignorance and arrogance of the invaders."
5,Books I have finnished,Have ejoyed The SEcret River on my newst Kindle the touch screen 3G. Now that I have finnished a baby blanket I was knitting I will be able to read more so I will review the other books I have purchased as soon as I can. Really love the 3G Touch
3,INTERESTING BOOK,I found the book engaging and enjoyed learning about the natives and of those men and women that were sent there.
2,boring,"I tried, but I just could not get into this book. Since I gor my kindle I guess I've become a little more critical about the books I read and if I get halfway through it and can't get interested I just delete it and move on. This was one of those books."
4,Interesting history,I really enjoyed this book from how the characters came to australia to them establishing a life there. Descriptions of the rough wild country and the rough wild characters was very engaging
4,Learning experience,I found the story a learning experience on many levels. It was interesting to see how the lowly became the masters and how it was accomplished.
5,"Made Me, My Mom, And My Toddler Laugh","We live in Texas so we see and eat a lot of this food. I really like the pronunciation key on the back. It really made me giggle (especially the first line, Hola! Jalapeno. I said Hello! my chile friend). The pictures are bright and festive, my son enjoyed that. I give it to him to look at when I change his diaper and he has a good old time."
4,Mexican food,Very cute book. I am now looking for nice Mexican wood play food to go with it for my grand daughter.
5,The best shampoo (and conditioner) I have ever tried,"I have auburn hair, and I recently got some red highlights, so I ordered this and the matching conditioner. The shampoo smells great (very natural) and paired with the conditioner, my hair always feels incredibly soft after I wash it, and even after it dries, which is very difficult for extremely curly/frizzy hair. The only bad thing about this product is that it is kind of expensive, but I think the pro's outweigh the con's. I don't have a review for the shampoo alone because I've always used it with the conditioner, but I looove Aveda Madder Root. Also, I think my hair is noticeably redder, but it is not drastic, and I don't think my highlights have faded at all."
3,In actuality it is 3.5.,"Well I picked this up after hearing good things about it and reading a interview with the author. I was attracted to her personality and I went out and bought this book. I think my money was well spent, it wasnt a fantastic book. But for a debut novel this is very good and promising. The plot revolves around the troubles of the Dunlap family who live in a W.A.S.P.y town in Massachusettes. Jack and Faith Dunlap are recently divorced, and their daughter Caroline has just returned home from college then there is Carolines younger brother who is troubled by the leaving,not of his mother but of the familys maid,Rosie(who ends up being pregnant with Jack Dunlaps child). The book basically deals with issues each of them face and how they deal with them. Their are some very interesting characters besides the Dunlap family that come into the story and this book is worth your time. To tell the truth I had to read it twice to really appreciate it."
1,Apocolyptic tripe,"ArghhhAnother lame post-nuclear holocaust film...A few touching moments about the end of civilization as we know it,but don't waste your time."
5,Shun is the best,"My husband is the cook in our house and each year I get him one new knife a tradition that started last year. He loves Shun, they cut nicely, never dull, and have a wonderful warranty. Well worth the money if you want to keep your knives for a very long time."
4,love this band,"I think this band is great. A hard driving band with great songs. This cd has a good variety of music styles which is what they seemed to want. My favorite songs are ""aching bones, worried mind"" and ""Kate, if you're listening"". I highly recommend to catch the band live to really hear what great musicians they really are."
3,good tunes from good guys,"The music from Steppin' In It's album, Children Take Your Shoes Off, embraces a variety of different sounds including blue grass, a little Irish flair, and some Jamaican beach music. A great cd to listen to to relax and an excellent beat in the car. Personal favorites of mine ""Kate, If You're Listening"" & ""Plenty"", capture what I think is the bands essence, exceptional vernacular put to phenomenal music."
5,Perfect book for my seven year old,My son loves this book. It's the perfect level for a 2nd grade reader. His teacher is reading the series to the class.
5,Dedication to song pays biggest dividends for Bublé,"Bublé pays respect to song. He caresses each note, injects feeling and his freshness is pleasing.Come Fly With Me should have been the title of this cd - his interpretations soar!!As a romantic, I found innocence and sincerity in That's All and How Can you Mend A Broken Heart.I recommend 'Michael Bublé' - an investment in any collection."
5,Worthy of Highest Praise ------- #1 disc/artist of the year,"Buble is worthy of highest praise. Incredible tone, phrasing like the late great masters of song. If you appreciate quality and sheer vocal talent, this IS the man you should listen to.The song list on the disk I found slightly confusing at first glance, but after listening, see the choices only highlight how powerful, sensual and smooth Buble is.This disc is without question my choice as #1 disc and singer of the year. I can only hope Buble will release another disc soon. He deserves the accolades he's being given all over the world for the respect he shows doing these songs and for introducing them to a generation that will love them to.Bravo!"
5,"Golden Tones, a pleasure to listen too","Only once in a lifetime does someone come along who sings like this.I've now played and replayed this stupendous album for days and can't get enough. The material he has covered are marvelous songs (some old standards, some newer) with rich arrangements and fantastic musicians. It's a topnotch album, one that reflects the high standard that Mr. Buble is being so widely applauded for. I read today that he has sold over 2.5 Million copies of this album worldwide and it's no wonder.Take a listen and discover why this is surely his first of many many many great hits."
4,I'm Impressed,"Although I am not crazy about the songs/arrangements ""Crazy Little Thing Called Love"" and ""How Do You Mend A Broken Heart"" being included in this otherwise impeccable offering, I am truly impressed.First, I have to say that I am shocked more people aren't raving about the musical arrangements and musicians backing him. This is what impressed me first and foremost while I was driving home from the post office listening to it for the first time. I had to crank it up even more. The musicians were hawt.Second, Michael's voice is very nice. I can only imagine it blossoming even further as he develops as an artist. The tonality and the range were right on target. However, I felt like a few songs were lacking the raw emotion and passion needed by a ""crooner"" to give these songs the depth that would make it truly a ""5"" song.I have recommended this cd to quite a few people."
3,A great new big band singer has arrived,I have heard a lot about Mike over the last year and I finally decided to buy one of his cds and see what the fuss was all about.I'm hear to tell you this young talent is for real. He has a very pleasent voice and a great style. He kind of reminds me of Paul Anka. By the way Paul was the exec. producer of this cd.For this project Mike used some great arrangers. One I would like to point out is Johnny Mandel. He did a super job with his arrangements.The only down side to this cd was the repertoire. I thouhgt it could have been a little bit better. That was why I only gave this cd a 3 star rating. My rating had nothing to do with Mike's voice or preformance.I would like to recommend this cd.
4,Quel rythme!!,"J'adore ce cd! Micheal Bublé m'impressionne car malgré son jeune ge (26 ans), il interprète tout ce qu'il chante de facon magistrale. Sa voix est superbe! En plus, il n'a pas peur de chanter des Grands Classiques tels que ceux qu'on trouve sur ce cd et je trouve que ca lui va très bien! Je vous encourage à vous procurer ce cd qui ne se démodera pas!"
5,Michael Buble Review,I ordered this CD from Amazon because I could not find it in any stores and I was very happy to find it here. I ordered four of them for Christmas gifts and it was a last minute decision. I received them in time and it is just a great CD. A modern Frank Sinatra sound. Great to listen to.
1,Garbage,"Seriously, if want to hear songs in the same arrangements as Frank, Dean and Sammy did, then I'd buy a Frank, Dean or Sammy CD. If I wanted to hear Kissing A Fool the way George Michael did it with George Michael's arrangements, then I'm gonna listen to my George Michael CD. Fever was done the same way Peggy Lee did it, only it's a guy's voice. True talent in artistry lies in one's OWN interpretation of a song, not how good he can copy the great ones of the past. I'd recommend Peter Cincotti instead."
1,Another Sinatra wanna be,Fortunately my Mom purchased the CD for me. After being put to sleep by it I awoke thinking I'll buy Mom Marilyn Manson and see if she gets the hint
2,Overproduced music,"I was very disappointed at this CD. I had heard Buble on TV only on one or two songs, then I bought the CD. To me it seems quite over-produced or gimick-y. Based on this, I do not see much reason to liken Buble to Sinatra, beyond the obvious similarity of music sung."
5,Foster finds another Star,"It seems David Foster knows his business and has a knack at recognizing and guiding great talents. First Josh Groban, now Michael Bublé - incredible! While Josh stoked the fires for 'popera', I'm sure Bublé will do the same for the love songs of the past 5 decades.""That's All"" is beautiful, and ""How can you mend a broken heart"" is another song that touches your soul.All said, it's just a remarkably well produced disc that features a crooner who's certainly gifted."
1,buble blows,"no sense of authenticity here, I don't believe him for a second when he sings these lyrics . . . truly unbelievable. His sense of pitch, phrasing, and swing are not impeccable, not natural.... i don't get why some love his kid . . . they must have never heard the real deal"
1,Yuk!,"Is this a joke? How in the world are we supposed to take this guy seriously? He has absolutely no talent and I find it hard to believe that anyone, outside his family and friends, finds this stuff enjoyable in any way, shape or form.This, along with his other albums, are virtually unlistenable. I am dead serious. He reminds me of a toned down Mark Harris (Mr. Matha Raye), and trust me folks...that ain't a good thing. Yikes!This CD is little more than coaster material at this point. Save your money!"
5,He tweaks the romantic side of me,"It's like ""love in the air music""Based on how this cd worked for me, I'd suggest candlelight, fine wine and your beau. Turn on the Buble and voila -- instant heat!"
4,Oh Buble!,"The only reason I probably had a listen to this fellow is because they were playing it repeatedly in a local CD shop. I decided I liked his voice, and I liked the songs he sang. Perfect combination! My husband even likes this CD. We both had Moondance in our heads for an entire night. I recommend this CD. It's something everyone will enjoy listening to so you don't have to fight about who gets to pick which CD to listen to in the car!"
2,Nice voice but not the original,I think he's got a real nice voice and the selection of songs in this album is good but I just think that he didn't really make the songs his... for example The Way You Look Tonight is a total copycat of Sinatra's ... and you know whoever goes against Frank LOSES MISERABLY...So nice effort to bring old classics to the new generations but it's definitely NOT- and I repeat NOT anything like the originals... and this comes from a 23 year-old...
1,Sappy,"Well, I heard Michael LIVE on the Sharon Osbourne show and I was really impressed after hearing him sing Kissing a Fool. I bought his CD soon after.Kissing a Fool is the only song on the cd I can say I like and even that wasn't near as good as what I heard on Mrs. O. In my opinion he doesn't do justice to any of the covers on his cd.I was really disappointed with his slow, melancholy, ushy gushy style. What were supposed to be smoldering, smokey ballads were utterly nauseating!If you want to hear Frank Sinatra or George Michael buy the originals.If you get sloppy drunk and want to cry, buy it.I think if it was packaged with a razor blade he could be charged with assisted suicide, cause it made me want to slash my wrists... (-;He's no Frank. He's no Lou. He's no George. He's a Bublé"
4,Enchatingly Mystical,"When you turn this enchanting music on you immediately want to grab your favorite chenille throw and curl up in your cozy chair. As you listen, you can't help and think up mystical stories to go along with the tunes. If your into Celtic rythms or in need of some soothing meditation time, buy this CD and order yourself some aroma therapy candles and you'll have a moment to yourself that will make you want to be sitting on a hill in Ireland with mist hitting your face.(if you want that effect right away, w/o paying for a ticket: grab a spray bottle and a fan)But,don't forget the music...."
4,Learning to exhale,"Yogi's Breathe Deep is an OK tea for those of us who have asthma and other respiratory ailments. It's a blend of eucalyptus, thyme, and peppermint. Eucalyptus has clearing qualities, but the thyme and peppermint... are kind of mild. Thyme is one of those laidback Gallic herbs (it's in Herbes de Provence blends) Yogi Tea'sYogi Cold Season, Herbal Tea Supplement, 16-Count Tea Bags (Pack of 6)is MUCH stronger, since it blends eucalyptus with the heady herbs of cinnamon, clove, and cardamom. Breathe Deep is great... but Cold Season has amazing clearing qualities."
3,Music Lover,"This is a good CD but I was expecting something a bit more up beat by the what the other reviews had posted. The playlist is composed of what would be considered ""country"" latin music."
4,Hi-quality brush; Kind of stiff,"I bought this for washing my car and windows on the house. Its a nice,well-made brush, but I would have preferred for it to be just a bit less stiff. Its not straw broom stiff, but the soft nylon bristles are packed very tightly and don't 'give' a whole lot. Like I said, its a nice brush and I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it."
1,Trash!,"I purchased this game for me and my children and we did not find it fun at all. We've enjoyed numerous platform games, but this one does not have much to offer. Monotonous and mundane...I would look elsewhere for an enjoyable video game...try simpsons hit and run...spongebob ""battle"" is HORRIBLE!"
5,sony flat screen tv,"I bought this, worrying that it would be so confusing to hook up, I would spend money hiring people to do it.It came with a large ""easy set-up"" sheet ( reminds me of what my Apple computers always come with). I was able to hook it up to a Direct TV/HD set-up myself. It worked right away. Amazing!Also, Amazon got it to me very quickly despite a blizzard and the fact that I live up a dirt road in a canyon in Colorado!"
5,A GREAT TV!,"We have been extremely happy with this TV. Even without the HD hookup, the picture is great, sharp and color is fantastic. Can't say enough good about this TV. Would recommend it highly to anyone.Audrey"
5,an indispensable classic,"When ``Elements'' came out in 1985, I loved it. I referred to it as my favourite book critiquing networking in 1995. And I have mourned the fact that Prentice Hall let it go out of print. Padlipsky's essays are pungent and acerbic; he is opinionated and hilarious. If you want to know what's wrong with X.25 or why OSI failed, Padlipsky will let you know. A wonderful book!"
3,Weak motor.,Great for 2x4's.Other than that it tends to bogg down when theres a medium load on the motor.
1,Please Do Not Buy This Game,WARNING: DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.It contains a bug in the middle levels that freezes the game everytime you play. This is crap CRAP CRAP!! Please don't buy this game for the sake of humanity and excellent games. Spit on it!!
1,Total waste of money!,"Do not buy this item if your vertical is over 28"" or you are an experienced athlete. The books methods don't train fast muscle fibers that are needed in jumping, on the contrary, the only thing it trains is your lactic acid endurance. I gained nothing, instead after 5 weeks of that crazy overtraining I had an injury on both of my knees (jumper's knee). The best method to improve your vertical leap is through weight training (low repetitions and heavy weights) and plyometrics (The Science of Jumping, Jumping into plyometrics, etc.). The AirAlert2 could only work for individuals with poor jumping ability (< 20""), but for them too this is a bad choise because of the high risk of knee injury. The best vertical program I know of is The Science of Jumping combined with weight training."
3,A Little More Delivered,"By the way, later on the author Timur Tukel sent me email and explained they had not received my refund request for some reason and told me they would refund my program after all."
3,"If you're transgender, be very wary of this film","My suggestion to anyone transgender interested in seeing thisfilm is not to do so. I myself am a sort of transgender known asandrogyne (someone with the gender identity of both a man and awoman -- or neither) and I found this film to be stifling anddisspiriting. I think the effect would be worse for someone who istranssexual. The transgender character is abused both physicallyand spiritually in this film like I have seen in no other, andthe film's hyperrealistic visual style makes the suffering allthe more palpable.I was drawn to the film because of the androgynous aspects ofthe original myth of Tiresius, and thought that the film wouldembellish and augment different things than it did. All it did,really, was heighten the misery of the situations. Its attemptsat poetry are cynical, ironic, and paradoxical. As a moralitytale, it is appalling, and it reveals the sick underside of thechurch in a whole new way."
3,"AN AMUSING MILHAUD ""MENAGERE,"" BUT WITH A SMALL CAVEAT","This CD packs in a goodly assortment of topnotch Milhaud piano vignettes, all played with verve and panache, but a little shy on warmth and depth. However, it is still quite worthwhile having, not least of all because it contains the charming ""La Muse Menagere,"" Op. 245 (""The Household Muse""). As well, it also fills in a multitude of gaps in the Milhaud piano repertoire and, as such, is fair competition. Ms. Choveaux is an excellent pianist, worthy of attention and consideration. She sparkles rather than shines; but many of these clever, quirky pieces call for just this. The caveat is, unfortunately, the sound. It's ambient, a tad too distant and slightly course-grained. However, the ear does eventually adjust.[Running time: 68:42]"
2,Not so hot,"I gave this a good try, but it didn't work for me. While flashy, the lessons were frustrating because they assumed I already knew vocabulary, sentence structure, and grammar. When I tried to find a way to learn the vocabulary directly, I couldn't. I suppose this is the ""immersion"" technique. Personally, it felt like an exercise in futility. I would rather learn material, then work with it, instead of working with it on a basis of ignorance. With no options for straight-ahead memorization, and with the frustration factor too high, it was adios muchachos."
3,Foreign Service Spanish Program,"This is for Magellan and everyone else who tried finding the Spanish teaching program used by the American Foreign Service.I ran into it on a shelf at, uh, Borders Books. The title is:Barron's Mastering Spanish, 2nd Edition.ISBN: 0-7641-7597-1Barron's hypes it as as the program used by our foreign service. And there are two Flavors: Level One and Level Two. Same format in both, 12 CDs and a textbook. Same price for each level: $79.95.(The software here insists I rate the program, but I have no idea what it's worth, so I gave it 3 stars, to satisfy the implacable electrons.)"
2,life time of this battery,"i went for the price and got this battery over the original sony one, but it lasted exactly six months. And right after, it cannot charge anymore. guess we get what we pay for.."
3,unit is okay,The reconditioning was average. Glide plate still bent and wrong diameter blade was sent. I probably would purchase again because of price but Milwaukee should emphasize quality assurance in their refurbishment shop.
5,Jazz Lover Must-Have,"A beautiful blend of styles, textures, voices, orchestration, and colors. Sit back with a bottle of wine and enjoy, or perfect for a party. Looking forward to the next album..."
5,Rescue!,"Rescuers is a favorite topic amongst teens reading about the Holocaust. Many of the teens involved became rescuers when their parents opted to hid Jews. Yet, there are the stories, such as Teresa Prekerowa who rescued a little girl in Warsaw and hid her even from Teresa's family. The stories of these brave teens, acting alone or with a group, are touching."
4,A nice little German Thriller,"This is a nice taut thriller with good performances by the main actors. Production by Tom Tykwer (Run, Lola, Run and Princess and Warrior). The plotting has some distinct similarities to the Princess and Warrior film, but stands nicely on it's own. German learners will enjoy the conversational quality of the dialogue which is quite easy to follow for an intermediate or above student."
3,With Reservations,"Although I love the songs on this CD, and the artists who perform them, I must take issue with the company that produces these ""enhanced"" disks. They intentionally sell defective merchandise hoping to discourage piracy, but in the process prevent customers from making full use of of their purchases. This CD does not work on my DVD player, which is supposed to be able to play CDs. I should not have to move my audio equipment around to listen to music I purchased legally. The music gets 5 stars, but the ""enhancements"" get 0. Unfortunately 2.5 stars isn't possible, so 3 it is. Until these companies cease producion of defective merchandise, I refuse to buy any more ""enhanced"" CDs."
1,DO NOT BUY!!!,This was certainly the worst soundtrack that I have ever heard! I was so upset because I thought that this was the the real musical score of the movie. I encourage everyone to stay clear of this soundtrack and DO NOT BUY!!
1,C S LEWIS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE!!!!!!!!!!,"If these partial tracks are indeed indicative of what this new Chronicles of Narnia is going to sound like, what a disappointment! Such a letdown after the magnificent music in the Lord of the Rings trilolgy!!!!"
1,Carfull This is not the sound track!!,"This is not the sound track to movie. It is music ""Inspired"" by the movie. it sucks"
5,Narnia Soundtrack Rocks!,"It is EXCELLENT to see outstanding Christian artists writing songs for this movie! Not only will the movie be released in mainstream media, but the CD too. The songs are awesome! Each group/artist has brought his/her/their unique style to the table and made it a huge success in my humble opinion. I'm particular fond of the Jars of Clay, Jeremy Camp, Toby Mac, and Bethany Dillon songs.... but, there is not one song on there I don't like! Get it! You'll enjoy it!"
4,"A Solemn, solid read...","For anyone who has experienced unrequited love, the very human theme of this book will definitely appeal to many readers. It is both timeless and timely. The narrator begins his narrative after the war, reflecting on the cemeteries and tombs of Italy. He then returns to the time of his boyhood, progressing from his early teens to early twenties. He is in love with a girl out of reach in a time of harsh prejudices and impending war.This book is solemn, solid, moving at an even pace towards its conclusion. The horrors of the world rest in the background of the narrative, the lives of these individuals are pained but real. The movie is a great introduction but I much preferred the book for the varying layers and the subtlety.If you are into Italian literature, this book is essential."
3,Not his best,"Behind the Door by the same author is a much better book. I'd be curious as to whether Garden was considered a classic before the movie, or if this is just another example of literature being considered subservient to film.That being said, Garden is a nice book that reads like a memoir of a young Jewish man in Italy of the 1930s."
5,Magic,"One of John Connolly's novels came with a CD fastened inside the cover. The CD had the title ""Voices from the Dark"", and included Kate Bush, Neko Case, Radar Bros., several others, and Hem. (I have about 15 days worth of music on my iPod, almost all of it in the rock genre. And I thought I knew what I liked.) Hem's contribution to this collection was ""Hollow"" (from Eveningland). I don't know how many times I listened to it over and over, but during that time I felt like I was transported to a land of pure magic, and believed that the only way I could continue in that place was to immediately collect the rest of Hem's recorded output. Rabbit Songs was first, and not a single regret followed."
1,Worked great and then just died,"I used this devise 4-5 times without an issue. Then it just 100% stopped working. I have heard this from other reviews. Seems to be a pattern. When it works, it's great. When you count on it and it's dead, it certainly will cause you to pick anther product next time. That's exactly what I am doing. No more Macally products!!"
2,Too anti public schools for me,"While the author points up what must be problems in the public schools, he never lets up. He is too anti public schools for my blood. I read a little over half of it, and I put it down. Didn't need that much negativism. A little lighter would have been better."
1,Does it really deserve this star?,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. EVER. Nothing could possibly be worse than this. If there is, it could kill you. This is a sad disgrace for a movie. I feel so sorry for Mark Hamill, he does a great acting job and he ends up with this cruddy film. The plot stinks, the acting (excluding Mark Hamill) is pretty bad, and the characters are so bad I don't want to talk about it."
1,Avoid this film like the plague!!,"This is a terrible film. It makes no sense at all, the acting is wooden and the dialogue is terrible. It doesn't even deserve one star. It is amazing to see how low Mark Hamill has sunk since Star Wars."
3,Inconsistently shines,"Lavalle's solo work always manages to contain enough finely honed production and melodic wonderment to intrigue listeners on to the next purchase, but then always reveals a sterile anti-energy with inconsistent, half-developed infestations sinking overall appreciation."
2,"A+ songwriter- gets better on ""Radio Musicola"" & ""the Works""","Nik Kershaw is a master at songwriting and that's already the case on this cd, one can tell back then that this musician is about to put out masterpieces...and that will be the case with his 2 following CD releases:the very inspired ""Radio Musicola"" (4 stars) and the absolutely fantastic ""The Works"" (5 stars material).If you like what you hear here, find these other two CDs you won't regret it!"
2,Way below par,"I stepped into this book knowing VERY little about 3dsmax and 3D modelling in general. The book is very unfocused. It starts to explain something like modifying a spline, but doesn't go into detail when they tell you to lock the vertices to modify them all at once. It's like the author has a severe case of ADD. Then again, it was written by--how many?--eight authors? And at around 1300 pages, it's just TOO big. This book is the perfect example of ""too many cooks in the kitchen.""This may serve as a somewhat decent reference, but beginners stay away. I'm going to try something else instead.."
2,"Sad, just sad.","Well, they wanted to make a really BIG book, they did it. But this don't mean this is a great book for everybody. For my, this was really just a expense of money. The organization of the book is really confusing, too much text, I got bored before learning things they could explain in a few words. Anyway the book have extensive contents and cover almost everithing of the software.I still thinking that Visual Quickstart Guide for 3D Studio Max (sorry for writing the name of the book here but think it will be usefull for other beginners like me)its great and hopes find another simple and nice to read and good in teaching book like this one.Sorry for the english."
4,Good Item but the size is small,"I bought this Jersy, thinking in a tall man that always he wears Large size, but when I saw the Jersey, I try on and it fixes me (I wear medium size) and of course not to him, and that was a problem for me. Anyway, the quality of the jersey is very good and I recommend to you but if you are a tall person, please buy one size bigger that usually you wear."
3,Igo Mini Powered Screwdriver Kit,This set is cute and reasonably priced. I keep it handy for little jobs.
1,Not my Cup of Tea,"There is really nothing to recommend this novel, if you can call it that, unless you like to read about pointless rapes and torture over, and over, and over again.The shock value wears off rather fast and the brutal details become rather tedious and mind numbing. I guess if you're into that sort of thing this book is for you. If you like at least a little meaning to what you read, skip it."
5,Great new band,"This a super CD from a new band. I realy like ""Can I get a Ride"" and ""Misery""! I look forward to their second CD."
2,This isn't your traditional Peanuts special,"Each year, we anxiously await the airing of ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"". That's one of our holiday highlights. Last year, we were curious about the new ""I Want a Dog for Christmas"" and tried to sit through it. We made it about halfway through, and couldn't stand to watch the rest. Rerun getting sent to the office for sexual harassment?? C'mon, give me a break. It's too bad that the writers of the new piece felt that they had to slide in such a PC agenda. Just watch the original instead."
5,Love this Moive,"Wasn't real sure about straying from the 'traditional' Peanuts movies but read the description and thought I'd buy it and see what it was like.I was impressed - Peanuts does it again; fun, captures interest and has a point for the kids about the work and responsibility of having a dog. Highly reccommend and am happy I purchased."
2,Weak,"I'm not sure what the guy below me is talking about. I am shocked that Felix would put his name on something of this low of quality. The track selection is fine. However, the mixing is absolutely poor compared to something like Felix's Bugged Out Mix. I was expecting some high quality house music properly mixed, instead I buy it and it's all 10 second mixes. And the one song in the middle that's kind of a downtempo track just jumps into another upbeat house track and it sounded horrible. I was very disappointed, because I have seen Felix live and own his other CDs and know how good he really is. Stay away from this CD, I can hardly see anyone that knows their stuff enjoying this."
3,"Not exactly what I needed, but helped.","If your goal is to build windows in a new home, this is your book. I was looking for a ""do it yourself"" book on installing windows in an existing home, and thought this would be a good resource. Unfortunatley it wasn't what I was looking for, but I did get some benefit. I learned about what makes a good window and how to do some shopping, hence my 3 star rating. Certainly not a waste of 11 bucks."
4,Its awesome!,"After learning how well this worked, I quickly purchased one for my Mother (she's a really bad smoker). However, she only used it for one days ... its hard for her to quit:( Still I highly recommend this to anyone who needs to calm there nerves."
1,unnacceptable,"The shipping box arrived in perfect condition, but the plastic box for the item that was inside was cut and the adapter was missing. It is useless for me now. How can I return this to amazon? How could this happen, a new item arrive open and with missing parts??? Be very careful if thinking on ordering this."
2,Modern for 1933,"It may be titled The Modern Wire Fox Terrier, but it was originally printed in 1933 London. Pictures are few, black and white and grainy. These are pix of dogs from that era. Info is great for background and history."
3,"Scary Plot, TOO WORDY!","I thought even though this book wasn't as long as It or The Stand, it was still to me, a bit of too much wordy nonsense. If this were shortened and revised or changed to a novella, it would be much better. Overall, it is a famous worldwide masterpiece that I would reccomend to anyone who has an appetite of being scared."
3,Fascinating novel but Kindle version has LOTS OF TYPOS,"I won't make this a detailed review as so many others have already weighed in. I enjoyed reading it because I had already read ""Needful Things"", the last Castle Rock novel, and ""Dark Half"" provides a lot of the backstory to that - in fact, ""Needful Things"" is pretty much a sequel to this one.Having said that, I must say I'm really irritated by how many typos are in the Kindle edition! And they're not just random, either. Every word beginning with the letters ""cl"" is changed to ""d"" - like ""dosed"" instead of ""closed"". Which is sometimes amusing (""There was a dick at the other end of the line"") but mostly irritating (ok, did he mean ""dear"" or ""clear""? it's not dear to me!).Seems like someone could have taken the time to read through the damn thing just once to weed out all these things. Maybe there was a dick at the end of their line, too."
1,Kindle version is awful!,"While I was definitely lured by the storyline of this particular King novel, the typos on the Kindle version are too frequent for comfortable reading. I don't know who exactly is in charge of the Kindle versions of some of these novels, but someone really should thoroughly review the conversion to Kindle format."
4,one wild ride,"This one kept me on the edge of my seat. Please, forget the horrible movie that was later made from this work, like many of Kings work it was butchered on screen. The book itself is wonderful example of why millions find his work so entralling. I think Stark is without a doubt one of Kings best villians. (rumor had it he had contemplated writing a book under the stark name...pity it never surfaced I can only imagine the severity of the violence that it would have held.) Just remember...the sparrows are flying again."
4,Better than average...,"As a fan of SK, I try to read whatever he puts out and am rarely disappointed. This is another of his many good, but not great books.It moves quickly through the story of a writer who's psuedonym takes living form and begins menacing real people. Its well written and an enjoyable read. Some plot lines are left dangling, but all in all the ending is a good payoff and you'll be glad you read it."
3,Good book but...,"This book was a good book but I found it some what difficult to read. I thought the book was written differently from other SK books. It seemed like SK had a quota of large words per each page which sometimes jumbled up sentences and took a while to get used to. After about the third chapter I adapted to the style of writing.This book was more of a mystery/suspense/thriller book rather than horror. Some of the scenes were haunting but more suspenseful and thrilling. This book reminded me of Pet Semetary. If you like the traditional SK, horror and easy reading, I wouldn't highly suggest this book; but it is a good short read.What I did like about this book was it had little cursing, sexual scenes, and those annoying long flashbacks. That is great, no flashbacks! None!Overall this was a good book but I enjoy the more traditional horror SK books. If you are like me I highly suggest: IT, Salem's Lot, Misery, The Shining, or Christine."
3,Not my favorite,Something about the sparrows bothered me. I didn't care for that angle. The rest of the story was great; but the sparrows thing didn't do it for me. The premise and plot were outstanding and very tense; but I would have preferred that King used another modus operandi for dealing with Stark.
5,Beautiful Melange of These Seven Herbs,"Provence is known throughout the culinary world as a stronghold. Often, one is called upon in a recipe for ""herbes de provence."" This is a combo of seven of the herbes used in this region:bay, fennel, marjoram, rosemary, sage, thyme, and savory.Here, seven of their top chefs take one of the herbes and create a burst of recipes featuring that herb.Feast your eyes and tastebuds on such as: Pears and Strawberries roasted with thyme honey, Confit of Rabbit shoulder in olvie oil and blinis with bay and eggplant compote, Braised Mediterranean bass with lemon and sage, River Trout en papillote with fennel and white wine, Thin Tuna tart with marjoram vinagirette, Apple Confit with savory,vanilla ice cream.This is not for the faint not ready to find the ingredients and try out the techniques. For those who do, the results are superb, intense and fresh with herbes! Bon Appetit!"
5,Searching for Baseballs' greatest players,"I have been reading and studying old time baseball for many years. Not only in search of the greatest players but also enjoying the characters that played the game because they loved it and their team and the city they played in.I have always heard about and thought Honus was a very good player. After doing my research I have come to the conclusion Honus is without a doubt one of the top players in the history of the game. He could play any position and play it well. He could run and steal bases almost at will. He could hit with the best. What is not as well known is he was a team player. He loved his team and did everything he could to help them win.What might be as important about Honus is his ""off-field"" life. He was a tremendous ambassador for the game of baseball, he was a great family man and he was a pillar of strength in the community.To sum it up, he was a great man. I am glad I did my research on him, which includes this book."
4,"Finally, no frame","I really like Mayor's books, however, after the first three where the plot was built around someone being framed, I was beginning to lose interest. No one is framed in this one, and the action moves right along. It gets a little confusing at the end, but overall , a good read."
5,The Skeleton's Knee,Am about half way through and would rather be reading than at work. Am a fan of Archer Mayor and hope for more books. Susan
1,Oh.. this is bad.,"These are not the original recordings. In fact, I don't even recognize the main vocalist. This CD sounds like a colection of bad 70's covers (Rod Stewart, Billy Joel, Stevie Wonder) and remakes of The Association's biggest hits from the 60's, all done by some bad wedding band from the 80's! All of the songs sound too polished and overproduced ... none of those great gritty 60's AM hits I remember so fondly from my youth. I should have gone with The Association's original Greatest Hits from 1968 now on CD. This one is heading for the trash!"
2,Re-recordings.,"An album of re-recordings (originally released as ""Vintage"" back in the 80s). This isn't a problem in and of itself, but of course it masquerades as a ""real"" hits compilation, which causes it to sink to the level of all of those dishonest K-Tel compilations from times-past. For collector's only, really, although it isn't *that* bad, and at least contains mostly original members."
3,Muffled,"I just learned of Lori McKenna from the Oprah show with Faith Hill. I typed in her name in ""keyword"" and was amazed that she was so popular and had made several albums!From reading about her, she is an amazing person and I really wanted to own all of her albums, but I can barely understand what she is saying, however, I still plan to buy at least one just because I can relate to her depth, her sincerity, herhonesty, her perception of life.I regret saying this, but I hope someone down the line continues to make her songs (like Faith Hill did) so that we can fully understand and appreciate them. Lori is a wonderful person, sothis, in no way, is meant to be offensive.I just can't make out much of what she is saying."
5,A POCKET RETREAT FRO CATHOLICS,Amazing book it makes want to do better in life. You have a more GOD awareness everyday.
4,one of my daugter's favorite.,One of my daughter's favorite book. She has so many books but we never forget to read this one at least once a week. The one copy she had might need replacing soon though.
5,Three Little Pigs,Cute book. I use it for a compare/contrast lesson in middle school. The kids still love this story.
4,Good knife,If it has a bolster it would be better. The knife is extremely sharp. it is a new one and I don't know how it will take sharpening. Knife is decent addition to my Shun kitchen set.
3,Great rhyming text - Very colorful graphics,"About a day at the beach. This book is perfect for babies and toddlers who love to hear rhyming text. It's fun to read out loud in a sing-songy voice. There are some lines that will make you laugh - even if your child doesn't understand. The illustrations are colorful. And of course, we love the title!"
4,Angry housewives eating bon bons,"Absolutely enjoyed reading this book about sisterhood in the neighborhood, women supporting each other no matter what fate throws at them. It takes a while to get to know all the characters and at times is written too lengthy but overall I highly recommend it to women of all ages."
2,cliched,"I wanted to like this book, but from the very first pages it felt forced and almost cloying. The friendships between these women didn't seem sincere, something I can't put my finger on just didn't ring true.The confusing presentation didn't help: some chapters were written in first person, others in 3rd, with no rhyme or reason. The plot line was predictable, the characters shallow and two dimensional.From the beginning it seemed the author was writing this for a future chick flick starring Julia Roberts, it was just so corny.I wish the book delved into more of the books read by the AHEB book club, but it didn't even do that.A disappointment."
4,Sorry to finish the book,"I bought this book as a quick easy read for a hot summer week-end and was pleasantly surprised. The women in this story were alot like me and my friends. We share the same problems, heartbreaks and joys. I highly recommend this to all women, but especially to women over 50 as you will identify with these ladies. This was truly an enjoyable book, so sit back, relax, sip the ice tea and and read."
1,Don't bother,"This book is a complete waste of time. The characters are not well developed and the plot choppy. I stopped reading after 150 pages. The premise sounded intriguing as the chapters are distinguished by whose house the women are meeting in for a book group and also by the book they are reading but other than the cleverness of this device, there are unfortunately no reasons to recommend this book."
1,over rated,"I agree with the NY reader - a waste of time. I waited on the library reserve list for months and was very disappointed. The characters are not well developed and the writing is amateurish. I did finish it because I was curious about how it could get such rave reviews but found it a 'women's' book. The ""holy whatever"" comments of one character were idiotic. Can't fathom how anyone could say it's the best book they ever read.For a good read try Alison McGee's Shadow Baby, Losing Julia, or Peace Like a River."
4,Great story of friendship!,Loved this book! Great story of female friendship... Very likeable characters...not predictable... Made me want to start a book club! But...the one and only negative...I DID NOT like the ending. I mean...really??? Would have given it a full 5 stars if it had a better ending.
3,Friends and their struggles,"I did like this book, though I think the characters were, as some have mentioned here, somewhat stereotypical. They needed to be ""fleshed out"" a little more, given more dimension. I felt that the story lacked in some areas and things turned out as we would have expected.I did however laugh out loud at some of the things that happened and enjoyed seeing the women bond the way that they did.Not great fiction, but it did keep me reading to the end."
1,Nothing but Fluff,"This book was recommended to me but I found it to be boring, predictable, unrealistic, etc. I finished it because I was told to keep reading it - that it would get better - but it did not get better."
4,"A Delightful ""Chick"" Read","How I loved House of Curl, but I loved this more. It was like Ya-Ya with less angst, but trust me, there is angst here... but the kind we can all relate to.We know these women, they are our friends, they are us. They feel like we do, they talk like we do... and they are strong and passionate like we are.This was a great quick read. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to just relax and enjoy a good book. It makes me proud to be a woman."
1,Angry Housewives Eating BonBons,Pointless dribble. This book went on and on about nothing. The characters were canned and the plot was empty. Just another off-the-shelf book about friends. Nothing special.
4,Good book club discussion,I found it difficult to get started in this book. I'm so glad I chose to stick with it & finish. What a great story about friends growing old together & life experiences. I feel like I really know these characters. I really recommend reading this.
4,I want to join this book club,"This book is a nice summer read. This is a story about friendship between women. It is about the support and companionship we get from our friends. Yes there may have been alot of cliches, but the book still brings much enjoyment. I thought the book started a little slow, but after that I could not put it down. Recommend!!"
3,Not Landvik's Best,"I enjoyed this book, but it's not Ms. Landvik's best (see ""Your Oasis on Flame Lake"" for her best). I found the jumpy narrative a little distracting-- why did Audrey and Slip get to talk in first person while Merit, Faith and Kari were left to third person? Often times the book fell into cliched sterotypes and some of it was pretty damn predicatble, but it's an entertaining read nonetheless."
2,A war with no winners,"This is a story about a completely useless war with no winners at all. It takes the author about 200 pages to set the environment. 200 Pages of introducing people, their alignments, and describing the war situation. Yet it remains unclear why two factions fight a futile war instead of simply sharing profit. After this the story unfolds with some interesting intrigues and a lot of action, for the next 200 pages. This is the best part of the book. At the end the author wants too much. Too many solutions suddenly pop up. The result is a chaotic finale with people changing sides, ending in an imaginary status quo. Imaginary, because the author seems to have forgotten that one of the factions controls all the recourses..."
4,Worthwhile,"Written over 20 years ago, this has the timeless quality that all of the great epic sci-fi novels have. The story revolves around a struggle between old Earth and the outer colonies (called the Union) that no longer depend on Earth for trade and sustenance; there are some obvious parallels to the American Revolution. Caught in between this galactic struggle is Downbelow Station on a world called Pell, which is trying to remain neutral.This is a complicated and intriguing story that is for the most part entertaining, but sometimes a little flat. For such a big book, there are some sections that seem sketchy, almost as if this was a trilogy that was condensed into a stand-alone novel. But for these relatively small problems, the novel was well written and is worthwhile reading for science fiction fans."
3,The problem with this book is it has too much in it.,"I recommend this book for those who want to understand Cherryh's Union/Alliance Universe. I also recommend Cherryh for writing the kind of science fiction that the field has allowed the star trek & star wars books to take over. Still, she has a tendency to put too much in her books & this is the most extreme example of that. The effect is either exciting or confusing, or a little bit of both. She is a good author & many will no doubt find this book to be a real rush."
5,AMAZING,"This is a truly mindblowing CD. The emotions I felt when I was listening to this were incredible. Christian Lindberg is one of the finest musicians ever. I am making it a point to try to own a copy of every recording he has ever made. The actual music selections are incredible. These composers truly do not get the recognition they should. America should be proud of composers that could write such amazing music. This an EXCELLENT CD. If you love trombone, or music in general, this is the CD to have."
3,much heavier than expected...,"Well, just received it and my first impression is: wow!! this is really heavy!!Unfortunately, being a metric system person, I did not realize that the 3.2 ounces specified were almost 100g which add 50% to the 245g weight of the Mares Proton Metal second stage I have. I wonder what would be the feeling when I have to keep that extra weight on my jaw. It does not look very promising... I already feel that the Proton Metal is on the heavy side when compared to the all plastic Proton (175g) which I have as Octopus. I will give it a try, but I am not optimistic... will report back if I change my mind later."
5,Excellent series. Sad to see it end.,The last three episodes were just as good as all the previous ones. The last episode wrapped most of the main characters up. I've read that perhaps there will be some episodes that were actually written but not filmed. I hope that is true as this is a great series. Sad if it ends. The acting and settings are superb. I will truly miss watching DCS Foyle.
5,More Foyle's War,"I loved this series and was not ready for it to end. Certianly, they could have gotten a few more years out of this before ending the story! Series 5 is too short and I will miss all of these characters. These last stories are kind of sad, and reflect life as it really is, both bitter and sweet. I'm a big fan and will miss this story, as Series 5 is the end."
5,Foyle's War Review,"It is hard to find movies depicting men of integrity, as well as compassion for people. Excellent acting, background music, as well as background scenery. Even though these DVDs are costly, for me and my wife, the cost was an investment in learning more about the activities of some of the English participants of World War II, not to mention excellent mysteries."
5,Too Bad The Series Got Canceled!!!!,"I really enjoyed this series, I have always liked murder mysteries and the actors & plots in this series are superb! The series was made for PBS and has 4 different stories of 90 minutes in length. Overall I would recommend any of the Lynley series except Season 6, and this is only because I haven't had the chance to see it yet!!! Season 6 only has 2 dvds because the show got canceled in mid season. This is a shame considering some of the garbage that is still on the air.This series is well worth having in your video library!!!!"
2,Where's the close captioning?,"I bought the first 3 seasons together in a box set and they were captioned, then the 4th season, it too was captioned. The 5th season was released by the same company and amazon didn't really say it was or wasn't. I like the series so I bought it. I was very disappointed that there was no caption on this set. A suggestion to Amazon, please list whether a DVD is captioned or not. It may not seem like a big deal but it is to me."
1,stupid. makes no sense.,i'll never get that (what felt like an) hour and a half of my life back. this movie made no sense and was very stupid. ugh waste of $2!
1,Dont waste Your Money,Dont waste your money !! A pack of gum is way more enjoyable! It was bad writing all the way around.
4,Intriguing book of an enigmatic leader,"A very well written and researched book on a fascinating leader who began the opening Russian society. Yet he presided over some of Stalin's worst excesses and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. Understanding Krushchev's actions are difficult to understand and explain, but Taubman provides rare insight into the man...but after finishing this book I still don't feel as if I understand Khrushchev's motives and his sheer incompetance."
5,"This CD is complex, powerful, and just bleed emotion.","This CD really got me into the more power-metalish sound but don't expect every power-metal group to sound like this. These guys are just off the wall awesome, and the songs are there to top. There is such a blend of intrumental and vocal in this that it's literally like they are of one sound. And you really feel the power behind every last track on this CD. In my opinion Angel Dust's best album although some do like to argue that ""Of Human Bondage"" is. This Album does stand tall and up to most everyone of my expectations. Have listened to it into oblivion but still manages to find it's way back to my ears."
3,"Has its strong points, but narration irritating","The footage in this two-tape series is stunning, but I have to admit that the narration by Barry Corbin makes me wonder if I ever want to see this again. To me, his voice is inseparable from the character of Maurice Minnifield in Northern Exposure, the sarcastic and difficult former astronaut on that TV series. His ""colorful"" phrases like, ""That went over like a turd in a punch bowl"" really caused the film to lose its appeal to me. Compare that with the ""colorful"" language of Pete Conrad in ""From the Earth to the Moon,"" which was an accurate representation of how Conrad really talked, and therefore worked much better in that film. Moon Shot is a documentary, but with the way they handled the narration, it seems too contrived to me."
1,BORING,"boring story. I've read all the real Left Behind books, but skipped through all the religious rants, and did not find this even at a slight comparison. I couldn't even get through the first chapter, and I tried to imagine it as funny, but couldn't even fake it. Unimaginative and a waste of money. Not even a good spoof on the original. Spend you hard earned cash elsewhere, like a Maxim subscription."
5,Great Racquet,"The racquet is fantastic, light weight. It has a low stiffness factor which is good if you have tennis elbow or some other injury. The large head packs alot of power."
2,Beginner Racquet,This racquet lacks the control necessary for higher paced shots. Good for a beginner player. Lacks precision necessary for an intermediate to advanced hitter.
2,Not a Bad racquet not a good one either...,Not the best of the racquets around.. I had the string cut more than twice within 3 months.. but kind of ok to play. You need to put a lot of power to send the ball back otherwise its a decent racquet but would advise prince O3 compared to this one.
3,Not bad at all,Not as good as i thought either. I think its better to go to some store and check out the racquet before buying online.
5,Great for the price,This racket performs very well for the price and I feel that it is helping me improve my game. It looks great and has a nice feel to it.
5,Everything great,"Nice racket, and cover. Im a new player and wanted to get something good, and it has worked well. Good price too."
3,Not the Best.,"Used this twice. The frame was & is still nice and sturdy. There are 2 parts in he main compartment, which is nice. So when you need something in the main compartment you don't have to make a mess & get that 1 something out. The other items on the description list are all nice. The 1 thing I would like is it to be a bit larger, then again that would mean more items to pack and weight. For an person that go's hiking 2's a year, camping 4 to 5x's a yr, this is perfect."
5,Amazing pack for the price,"I bought this pack over a year ago and have been on about 20 hikes so far with it and I really don't have many complaints. I am 6'1 and the pack sits on me just fine. I have noticed the shoulder pads at time seem to wear down on me about 10+ miles. I ended up wrapping around the tops of them with some bandanas and it has worked out so far.Also the bag is a little heavy, With any pack it's really hit and miss. depending on the body type. Nothing has broke so far and it has seen some abuse so far. I highly recommend a pack from this company if you want some bang for your buck."
2,Uncomfortable Straps...,"After trying this pack on, I have discovered that even though it fits my torso (and would fit many people larger or smaller, due to adjustable torso, the shoulder straps are at a strange angle and the inside edges bear the backward pressure of the pack into your shoulders too much. Basically my only complaint is uneven strap contact with the body. adjustment cannot correct for this. Otherwise a very affordable pack!"
5,great pack at a great price,Well worth the money. My son used it on a boy scout excursion and it worked very nicely. Would recommend it as a great pack for entry level campers. No negative thoughts at all. . .
4,Great pack,"Despite the reviews of the sleeping bag compartment being too small, I still decided to purchase. The first time I put my 0 degree bag in the compartment it took me about 20 minutes (for real) and I had to remove it from the compression sack, the second time it took only about 10 minutes and now I can stuff it in there in a few minutes. There is an extreme amount of pressure on the zippers and I hope they hold- so far so good. I like everything else about the pack and cant wait for the weather to break and hit some trails."
2,Neat Features/Uncomfortable,"I bought this with a very hopeful attitude after reading the other reviews. Had tested a number of backpacks loaded with various weights and even gotten helpful hints on adjusting at a store. This pack came with some nice features: separate sleeping bag compartment, lots of compartments, decent size for class, built in rain fly, places to attach things. However, there's a point where the shoulder pads attach to the bag that is a big uncomfortable knot in my shoulders. Also, no matter how I adjusted for height, the pack felt like it was pulling me backward at the shoulders, not shifting weight to the hip belt. I had to send it back and replace it with one at twice the cost. I was sad, because it's nifty for all the features. If you're new, please make sure you get good advice and know how one should fit before you try this one on - that way, you'll be able to make a good decision."
4,Great product for the price,"Love the price of this backpack. Overall it is a great pack. Love the sleeping bag compartment and the built in rain cover. The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because one of the lid straps broke loose from the fabric when we first tried to cinch it down. Other than that, we love it."
3,"Good, won't last forever","I bought this guy a few years ago for general hiking/backpacking/travel use. It lasted a couple years and maybe a dozen or so trips before the straps started ripping off and zippers started breaking. For half the price of a more well-made pack you're going to end up with a quarter of the lifespan. If you do a lot of trips, then spend the extra money. Otherwise, this pack will suit you just fine.Pros:-Comfortable, easy to adjust and tighten straps-Enough pockets-Comes with rain cover, pretty water resistant on it's own-Big enough for a week-long trip, small enough to fit in the overhead bin on a flightCons:-Construction quality leaves a little to be desired"
3,Kief,"Took this thing around Europe living outdoors with 30-35 lbs of luggage for 4 weeks. Several problems. a couple drawstrings broke, and the plastic caps for the drawstrings all came off if they weren't refastened every day. Finally, the internal frame is cheap, and bent out after about a week of use, making it very uncomfortable to hike around the Italian Alps with 30 lbs of crap digging into the left side of my back. The fabric and zippers are durable, so This backpack is good for kids and car campers, but I'll be looking for something more durable for my next trip."
4,Playtex gloves,"What's to say about rubber gloves? They fit, and keep my hands out of the poop I mentioned in my review about the toilet plunger.ps: I'm not going to play your review game again."
1,Complete Disappointment - Don't Buy Season 3,We purchased Seasons 3 & 4 of Blue Murder based upon our experience with Seasons 1 & 2 and the actors/characters which are rather interesting. Season 3 is a complete rip-off!!! Only 3 stories on 2 DVD's!!! A complete rip off!!! The stories were OK in themselves but the 2nd DVD which contained 1-story and a documentary on behind the scenes trivia was a complete rip-off as far as I'm concerned. Season 4 is the last edition (to include this fiasco) we shall purchase. For how expensive these British mysteries are you'd think they actually would give the viewer an actual story/mystery to watch.
4,its fun enough,well i first got this book when i was in high school.. i found it to be entertaining and the pictures helped to cement the vocab.. however this book has WAY too many classroom vocabulary.. plus some of the activities are for groups..so its tough for a home learner unless you have someone else doing it with you..one of the nice things is that it starts out with romaji then works its way until all pronunciation guides are in kana and then it introduces some basic kanji by the end..all and all not bad
4,Good Resource,"I used this textbook in high school and really liked using it, but I wish my teacher knew what they were doing. I would definitely recommend for those wanting to learn Japanese on their own or want to use it for review after their Japanese class has ended. I would not recommend buying it from Amazon though, because you can get the paperback version brand new for $45 from the website."
1,"stirrer is right, but way too generous","on the liner notes to one of the two blues albums (i think it is shaker) it is said that the original idea was just to perform some of these songs in a one night concert. that should have been as far as it went. to foist these songs on an unsuspecting public at 19 bucks a crack is highway robbery. if these are blues songs, then i am robert johnson's illegitimate son. ""death letter"" is good, maybe even great, but cannot compare to the original or to any of the covers i have previously heard. the rest is a waste of time. the cover art is excellent but hardly the reason you would be expected to buy the cd. these are my first 2 reviews by the way, but all these 5-star reviews for both cd's finally got me motivated. go buy a muddy waters or lightning hopkins cd and save 10 bucks in the bargain."
2,Stirrer,"Why must a punk-rocker record such an awful piece of country-rock dities. It seems to be a trendy move, and last I remembered the DJ was original in his punk dabblings of the obsurd. I think he was really trying to sound like Tom Waits a la who tries to sound like Captain Beefheart/Louie Armstrong! This album requires a glass of lemon-ade and a rifle to listen to it, not to mention a rocking chair and a porch, and down south w/ a couple skynrd tapes. AND I am a huge fan of punk-work outs. WHY? One must ask DJ why..."
4,review,I like this deodorant. I have been using this product for a while. I like the scent and that it doesn't leave stains on clothes.
4,Lorie Is A Pleasant Earful,"A CD of easy listening favorites arranged by a very talented and energetic lady. Who knew her beginnings in a Minnesota department store at a grand piano would lead to such pleasantries for those who catch her show or purchase her CD's. Good job, team!"
1,"So-so reproduction, bad trademarking","Having used a French deck for the last twenty-six years, I thought I would try the Rider Waite deck. When I got them, imagine my surprise and disgust when "" US GAMES"" is printed on the front of each card! Though in small print, it is quite legible and very much unwelcomed. Additionally, the reproduction herein is not accurate nor is it very well done. There is an English Rider version of this deck that is *so* much better.Pass on this version and get the English version instead."
2,Not Happy,"I have just received these cards and am dissatisfied with the colouring on them. When I compare them to a similar pack I have, which is made by another company, all the colours are poor, i.e. not vibrant. In particularly the `blues' (water, sky etc.) appear a dull pastel green. Also, the outlines in the pictures are thicker, giving the appearance of less detail."
4,Good deck,"This is the original deck. It is an interesting setup, If you collect decks I would suggest you get one.. If you are reading I dont think it would be so good unless you have a holder for the cards. the box it comes in is large so it is not like the other decks that have thier own case."
4,Great ... but,"This bag is well made ans very durable. It fits my video tripod perfectly, however, there is no room for anything else, like a dolly or a sandbag. If you need either, you'll need a separate accessory bag, or, you can throw everything in a pelican which is what i usually end up doing. the bag works for what it is, but I wish they had taken into account how tripods are actually used to make it easier on us to get what we need where we need it with as few bags as possible."
4,WWF WrestleMania VIII,"The highlights of this video are a great World Title match between Champ Ric Flair & Randy Savage and an Inter-continental Title match between Champ Roddy Piper & Bret Hart.These two matches alone are worth the price.Hulk Hogan vs Sid,though not a great match has lots of heat and a surprise ending."
5,WRESTLEMANIA 8 WAS ONE OF THE AWESOME WM,"WRESTLEMAIA 8 had some cool matches but my best ones where the Macho Man face Ric Flair{CHAMPION} for the wwf title in one of the best world title match's ever also my othere best one was for the IC CHAMPIONSHIP Rowdy Roddy Piper{CHAMPION} vs Bret ""Hite Man"" Hart this match was a real classic match up and there was the main event of WRESTLEMANIA 8 Sid Justice vs Hulk Hogen this match could of been alot better but the return of The Ultimate Warrior made the match ok but overall WRESTLEMANIA 8 was awesome a must bye."
3,WM8 Review!,"What was originally supposed to be Hulk Hogan vs. Ric Flair in a dream match turned into two seperate matches where Macho Man challenged Flair for the belt and the honor of his wife, Miss Elizabeth and Hogan faced Sid Justice in what was advertised as Hogan's farewell match from the WWF.This event also featured the classic Intercontinental Title match between ""Rowdy"" Roddy Piper and Bret Hart and the grudge match between The Undertaker and Jake Roberts. You also get to see Shawn Michaels take on ""El Matador"" Tito Santana in the opening match.The tag team title match between Natural Disasters and Money, Inc. is kind of poor and there are a few other average matches but all in all, WM8 was a good show."
2,WRESTLEMANIA VIII-SURPRISINGLY WEAK,"Surprisingly enough, this WrestleMania is rather weak. In fact, it turns out to be more like an extended version of Raw Is War. For one, most of the matches are disappointing. The WWF championship match is not the last match as it usually should be. It was a fair match, but it should have been saved for last. Another disappointment is the last match between Hulk Hogan and Sid Justice. Hogan had always been known for weak matches, but this one ends on a disqualification. However, the Intercontinental title match between champion Rowdy Roddy Piper against Bret Hart is worth watching. One of the biggest disappointments is Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby ""The Brain"" Heenan's poor commentating after the WWF title match as they forget about the match taking place."
5,Still one of the best World War II films,"I too have seen A walk In The Sun countless times since I first saw it on television when I was a kid in the mid 1950's. I still believe that it is one of the best war films ever made. Yes, I also have seen Saving Private Ryan many times and love it as well.In many ways, these films have a lot in common. They both exemplify the tenseness and horror of war. While SPR is more graphic, A Walk In The Sun succeeds with superb camera work and more subtlety.The acting in A Walk In The Sun is excellent and I practically memorized all of the humorous dialogue between Pvts Rivera (Richard Conte) and Freedman (George Tyne). These two were a quintesential element of the film.This film was excellently directed by Lewis Milestone and should not be missed."
3,Fire Fighter I & II (Exam Prep) (Exam Prep (Jones & Bartlett Publishers)),"I recently bought this book to prepare myself for the Florida State Fire fighter equivalency written exam. I have to say it was helpful in, helping me find my weaknesses, but very few questions that were on my exam were in this book. It has been 7 years since I had went through fire school, so I had forgot alot. Overall, the book did help, and I would recommend it to anyone who needs to find their weaknesses. The book has great references for a number of books, so you can look up the questions you get wrong and review the parts you are weak in."
5,Incredible Melodic Rock release!!!!,"The comparisons to Bon Jovi are undeniable but to simply compare Johnny Lima to a bygone era of Bon Jovi is not doing Mr. Lima justice. Yes, his voice is very similar to Jon's and even his songs are similar in style to Bon Jovi's. Not that it's a bad thing, I am a huge fan of Bon Jovi from the self titled album to The Circle. But I have read reviews that say he is a Bon Jovi wannabe and such. That is not true. Johnny has released several excellent albums that is far better than any of the crap pervading the airwaves these days. Version 1.2, which is actually a re-recorded version of Johnny's first album, is one freaking awesome album. His best in my opinion. Every album he has put out is phenomenal and I highly highly recommend any of his music to anyone who likes melodic rock, aor, hair metal or anything close. He is also very nice to talk to. Please give his music a chance and help out an artist that is still putting out true rock n' roll. Rock on Johnny!"
4,Excellent TV,"We purchased this TV last fall from Amazon. Even though it's ""only"" 720p, the picture quality when watching HD channels and DVD's is excellent. The quality of regular TV channels is decent and watchable. We also use it to watch Netflix streaming movies through our computer and the experience is surprisingly good.If you buy from Amazon, don't forget to watch the prices for 30 days after the purchase. If the price is reduced, Amazon will refund you the difference. We got almost $100 back this way, but they will not do it automatically. You need to send them an email and ask for it."
5,Best Shoes Ever,I have bought several pairs of these shoes throughout the last few years. They are the most comfortable shoes that I can wear for hours without my feet or legs becoming tired or sore. They almost feel like I'm wearing sleepers. I hope they never stop making this style.
2,Disappointing,"Doc Martin, The Movies was disappointing. I rented it because the description said this is where the tv show and it's characters got their inspiration. The Doc is a totally different person - he drinks (sometimes to excess), he smokes, he swears, and he's married! I don't know where Doctor Elingham came from, but it's a far cry from the Doctor Bramford in the movie. The Doc of the tv series is charming in his own curmudgeonly way, the characters are so much more quirky and likable. The movie was not charming or quirky."
2,Defective disc,"I'm a hugh fan of the Doc Martin series - Have watched all four seasons and am eagerly awaiting season 5. In the meantime, I purchased ""Doc Martin, The Movies"" because of my interest in understanding how the PBS series came to be. Unfortunately, the first disc in the 2 disc set was defective and resulted in a return. The second disc was fine and so all was not lost but I did so want to see that first movie."
4,Good,The series of Doc Martin is much better. This movie is a softer gentler Doc. The rude crass Doc is funnier and better.
4,Not as good as the TV series,"Although ""Doc Martin"" is a similar character to the PBS series, it is not as charming a story. Still, the beauty of the area and the quirkiness of the characters is fun."
4,"Enchanting Series, Problem w/ DVDs","Nothing can top the Doc Martin shows. Love the scenery, the characters, the story line.The problem stems from the DVD hanging up or freezing in just about every one of the disks.Because I want to see the episodes, I put up with it. Some folks might not persevere.I'm keeping the disks however, because I do enjoy watching them when nothing new is on TV.The same people put out the movies and the TV series, and I got them all. Same problemacross the board."
1,If you like Doc martin,If you like the T.V. series Doc Martin because of who and what Doc Martin is.......Then it is my opinion that you should NOT buy this product. Nothing is the same as in the T.V. series.
5,Memento Mori,"The best memento you can get from your visit to this astonishing museum. My only regret is that, fifty years from now, these dioramas will be the only remains of a beautiful natural world that once was."
4,Very unique flavor,"I bought this tea without looking at the ingredients. I got home, made a cup, and couldn't believe how pungent the scent was. I took a sip, and found it quite tasty, but really unique. After reading through the ingredients, I probably found it unique because of the pepper, cardamom, oregano, and basil in this tea. Probably the first time I've had these in a tea!That being said, it's tasty and soothing. I have chronic allergy/sinus issues so I wasn't expecting it to be a cure for any of them, but it is soothing and makes me feel a little better."
4,Very effective but only if used at start of cold,"This works really well at either reducing or preventing coughs and colds, but you have to start using it at the first sign of a cold--as in, I think I may be getting something; not at the stage where you know you have something. If you use if after you have major cold symptoms (as opposed to just the start of a sore throat or feeling ""bleh""), I haven't found it to do much at all. My kids love the taste and it goes down easily."
5,use quality name brand,I've used this product several times on carbureted cars and have never had a problem so I expect good service out of this one!
5,Really wonderful book,The biography and life works of incredible artist and illustrator Windsor McCay is just a phenomninal representation of his life and works and should be read by anyone interested in his art. I thoroghly enjoyed it.
2,Dull prose mars this effort,"She's got some good points, but jargon-laden prose makes this one a sleeper."
1,Ralphie has been better,sorry to say this is not what I had hoped it would be. Ralphie is normally hysterical but this is just stupid.
3,Baggin,Shipping was very fast. Not quite what I though tit would be but still funny. Pricing was very good.
4,Beautiful piece,I LOVED this necklace. In fact I loved it so much I bought it twice but had to give it a 4 instead of a 5 because BOTH times it dropped on the ground and shattered to pieces. And I just don't love it enough to buy it a third time no matter how much I loved it. I guess I need a more durable necklace!
5,The best you can get!,"This stevia is great. You can use it in beverages, baking, anything! It took me a day or two to get used to it, though--you've really got to start with just a few drops and adjust to taste. If you use too much, then you can detect the aftertaste. Just remember that a little goes a long way."
5,"Riveting, the sound will raise the hairs on your body!","Nirvana's final musical album, a compilation of seventeen live performances, was probably the greatest collection of live music ever put together. The sound of the early ""grunge"" music still lives on with me, and I highly recommend this CD for all those who experienced NIRVANA."
5,what a cd!!!!,"ok, this cd shows all the pureness, and expresionism of nirvana, the real kurdt cobain out of the studios, he gets possesed by the music and realy sings with his heart, the pure raw energy focused. there are many songs, all of them are realy good, kinda like a hits cd. its like going to the stadium to a concert or something, you will get involved with the songs if you like grunge. dont be afraid to buy any nirvana cd if you liked nevermind, they are all good, i mean it.P.D. Did anyone noticed that dave made a mistake in breed, and that kurdt changed all the lyrics"
5,Great live recording...,"There are are few things that can match the force of a live recording, and this album does not disappoint. The sound is just amazing, making me wonder what would be of this album if it were a studio recording and not live.I don't think it would be as amazing.Raw intensity, the power played in the chords, emotion poured out in the songs, this album is what really made Nirvana one of my favorite bands. Sure, they had the break-through success with Nevermind, and gained some more recognition with In Utero, developed the fanbase with Incesticide, and then there was always ""Bleach"", all of which are represented, including a song (which to my knowledge) was not previously released, Spank Thru. In the liner notes, Krist says that Spank Thru was the first actual Nirvana song.So, all in all, if you are into live recordings, dig Nirvana, are a Nirvana completist, or just want some good music, get this album in the near future."
5,Magic for unbelievers,"If you believe in science or science is your ultimate proof for unexplainable things in Your life then C. G. Jung certainly is able to take You on a legal mystery tour to the other side of believable. If there is any truth in Jungs work then so it is in I Ching, Bible, numerous alchemist and astrolog works from the earliest times of humankind till now.The written language itself might seem complicated and sometimes totaly incomprehensible, but bear in mind it's a takeout from Jungs writings which where meant to be read only by profesionals and scholars. It just makes his works more valuable and besides one can always read hard to understand places twice or google those greek or latin phrases."
5,King's Mary Russell Series,"I LOVE this series by Laurie R. King and highly recommend it. I wait patiently...well, ok, not so much...but I wait until the trade sized paperback is released after the hard back to add each new volume to my collection. And I've turned three of my friends onto this series and they all LOVE it as well!!! Used copies of these books are very hard to find!! Besides, for me, they are definitely keepers, so new non-e-book is the way to go for me!!! Have already had several re-reads and am looking forward to more!!! ENJOY!!!"
4,Not quite balanced,"It was OK although I have to say I was a little disappointed with some of the track selection. There were some good tracks here and there but the CDs seemed totally inconsistent. In both CD they would start out alright and then suddenly it would drift off. A little different style from what i've typically heard from AP.CD 1 was very chill and had some nice beats bordering house and breaks but then a vocal track 7 was added, which although isn't too bad, was totatlly outta place. Then it slowed down and got a little boring only to pick up just a a little towards the end.CD 2 was more dark progressive and started off good with tracks 1-3 and then suddenly strange vocals tracks are added 4-5. I hate vocals especially if its a guy talking. These kinds of tracks don't belong in a good progressive set. The rest is ok with some notable tracks 9-10 but the CD never picks up as I was expecting from a 2nd CD after a chilled out first one.OK but not his best."
3,office chair,"more cheaply made than I expected, but I guess that's why the price is low. Adequate chair."
3,Pretty Good Debut,"the Sos Band came out with some Jams.there debut Album has some catchy Grooves.""Take Your Time"" was always the Jam&Still is.they have some Pretty Good Albums&it's cool that more of there stuff is coming out on CD."
5,Happiness through rational selfishness,"If you want to learn how to truly live your life in a way that is meaningful and virtuous, get this book. Biddle shows how to live life using an objective code of moral values where Man's life is the standard of value. He uses solid examples and leaves no room for subjectivism. Much better than the works of those like Nathaniel Branden, whose dishonesty is only matched by his philosophical confusion.Recommended for those both familiar and unfamiliar with Ayn Rand's philosophy of rational self-interest (a philosophy that says that greed is indeed good - if the material and spiritual rewards of that greed are not received by force but by voluntary contract)."
2,"Decent, More Objectivism","This is not very original work. Basically an Objectivist introduction, with some analysis. The shortcommings of the book, then, are fairly easily predicted. Read up on other philosophy in addition to reading this (if you MUST buy it). I haven't the heart to bash people's ideas here."
3,Mellow on a higher scale,"I think this album is too mellow. The only time this album sees the light of day is when I feel like meditating...which is pretty much never. I love ""Natural Way"" and ""Jah Light"", but the rest are too mellow. I guess I can't get into dub, I tryed, but roots just keeps pulling me back."
5,My favorite gloves,These are the best rubber gloves I've ever owned. They are comfortable and protect my hands well from the super-hot water that I like to use on the dishes. The fold-over cuffs are great for keeping water from getting inside. Highly recommended.
4,"Gabriela,clavo y canela","This book was ordered for a 16 year old Latina friend of mine and I also ordered the book in English. I'm reading it currenlty, but I have sent a warning to my friends parents that the story involves graphic depictions of the rough times and virile men of this small Brazilian town, founded on cacao plantation ethics in the early 1900s. Probably not the proper choice for a 16 yr old, but I'm finding it an interesting tale of how the agrarian cacao culture developed at this time of Brazil's history. Good character development and multiple story lines keeps your attention."
3,Interesting,"She's a wonderful writer and the stories are really nice but the pictures altho beautiful didn't match recipes the potatoe salad is a perfect example the picture is very yellow ...eggs yolks alone will not make it that yellow, also the red rice ball ...I personally felt there was too much empty space in the book ...and too much sugar in the southern veggies...I really did enjoy reading the complete book (which I rarely read a complete cook book) it was a lovely book but she seem to have writer block ..I could feel it ...I wish her much love"
4,Delightful,"This book has it all: succulent pictures, good soul food recipes, but most of all interesting and funny stories. A must-read, not only for women, but for everybody with a passion for food and love of good heart-felt writing."
4,Great stories and good recipes,"I love Maya Angelou and the way she tells her stories. I've read several of her books and is always amazed of how she finds joy in every situation. ""Hallelujah! The Welcome Table"" should not be used as just a cookbook. It should be read cover to cover. The recipes are always accompanied by an amusing story. The stories are funny, touching and well-written. I gave it four stars because there are not too many recipes in this book, but the recipes that she has are very good--basic down home cooking, nothing fancy. I've made her Ashford Salad (Romaine lettuce with avocado dressing) p.211 countless times. This book is a good collection of short stories with recipes."
3,Didn't work with my optical mouse,"I was very impressed by the way it looked, but this mouse pad did not work with my Apple Magic Mouse. Using this pad caused the curser to jump all over the place. It was not a satisfying experience, and I had to give it away. All optical mouses may have this same problem. If you use an optical mouse, then I recommend against getting this product until someone with the same mouse gives it a favorable review. I would certainly recommend against it if you use an Apple Magic Mouse."
1,Cheap reprint DO NOT BUY,"The edition offered by Amazon is a low-quality reprint that does not have publisher info, TOC, index, or even figures! The footnotes with hyperlink underlining intact show the cheapness.Use the Search Inside feature to see for yourself. Why does Amazon sell this crappy version?"
1,Utter Garbage,"I find it incredible that anyone believes this claptrap, and tragic that it has fallen into the hands of ill-educated, but politically potent, ideologues who use such shoddy scholarship to reinforce their economic predilections.Yeah, I'm talkin' to you, Paul.For anyone else considering wasting hardearned cash on Murray Rothbard, other negative reviewers have addressed the faults of this tome nicely. It really is paranoid garbage.For cryin' out loud, read Robert McElvaine on this subject. Read John Maynard Keynes. Challenge yourself: read Richard Hofstadter."
5,,ICE MAGIC IS REALLY GOOD. I LOVE IT NOT JUST BECAUSE I LIKE HOCHEY I LOVE IT BECAUSE I LOVE IT. ICE MAGIC HAS EVERYTHING IT HAS ACTION & OTHER THINGS I LIKE IN MOVIES. IF YOU READ THIS BOOK IBET YOU WILL LOVE IT TO.
1,"Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah, Blah","""Tender Love"" by Force MDs is such a beautiful song and I can't believe it was used to create this garbage. ""Here We Go Again"" irritates the he11 out of me. Another lame unoriginal song about some guy treating you wrong. Trina's presentation on this song is so obnoxious that I don't blame any guy cheating on her with another girl."
1,Annoying and Obnoxious,"The writing style of the author is so obnoxious and annoying, that I never made it past the first few pages. Here's a few examples:* From page 4, under ""How much should you know about music to use this book"", he writes, ""Alphabet letters A through G (gosh, you don't even have to know letters H through Z!)"".* Here's another on the same page: ""Will any of this hurt? I certainly hope not. Just don't turn the pages too quickly--paper cuts really sting!""* One more, on page 14: ""Drummers call these the backbeats, but then most drummers can't read music, so don't listen to them!""If you find those things funny, then go ahead and buy this book. But if you find those ""jokes"" obnoxious and annoying, then pass it by. I recommend Mark Harrison's, ""The Pop Piano Book"" instead."
4,Paper could be stronger,"We have just received these cards. I like the pictures except a few of them. For example shapes would be better with color not just plain white heart, square... even though I bought these for my 17 months old daughter I had to put away only 20 of them(those are harder to understand like ""exit"" sign). But these are better for us than cards with drawings because she finds some of those ugly.The 1 star loss is for the quality of the paper."
5,The Night of the Hunter with Robert Mitchum,"How can I NOT give this 5 stars!!!!???? It's such a classic....have seen it before on TCM, and decided to buy it for my son, who loved it as well....what a performance by Mitchum....evil personified....! Everyone should take the time to see this movie, it's great!!!"
3,Needed an editor,"Having a long-standing amateur's interest in both archaeology and high-altitude mountaineer (I am neither an archaeologist nor a mountaineer myself) I was predisposed to like this book. But the first two chapters really put me off. Having a really exciting story to tell, Reinhard spends far too much time telling us what a great explorer he is and what jerks the Peruvian archaeological establishment, and even his fellow climbers, are. Reinhard can be justifiably proud of his accomplishments, but his arrogance is annoying and distracting.Much of the rest of the book seems to have been transcribed almost without editing from his personal diaries, interspersed with random factoids about Inca culture and mummy conservation techniques. What should have been a riveting account was choppy and hard to read.I agree with the other reviewers that the photos were great, though!"
4,Great for MST3K or Mike Nelson fans,"To tide you over until the next ""Movie Megacheese"" or whatever. Very funny captions, worth a look. A nice book in its own right, but not very much to it other than the very brief captions by Nelson. The pictures reminded me of my 1970s childhood in a creepy, uncomfortable way. I recommend buying it used (sorry!)"
5,Giving Her Best That She's Got!,"Anita Baker is truly one of the finest songstresses and vocalists of our generation. I wished that she would put out more albums but this compilation highlights 18 finest songs from her career. Unlike other singers of her generation, Anita Baker has maintained a low profile. We don't hear about her much except when she is ready to perform at Radio City Music Hall or on Saturday Night Live. She is a lady with class, grace, talent, and her own unique style.Her songs and some of my favorites include Just Because, Sweet Love, Rapture, 365 Days a Year, Giving You The Best That I've Got, etc. They were hits in the 1980s and maybe the early nineties. It only seemed like yesterday to me.When Anita Baker sings, it's unforgettable and she is in the same league as better known singers like Natalie Cole, Whitney Houston, and Patti LaBelle. For me, Anita Baker is a class act whose songs aren't politically motivated but are emotionally stunning."
3,"Not enough ""best"" for a ""best of""","Typically, when I buy a ""best of"" collection of an artist, I am familiar with the top hits, but there are usually some pleasant surprises from obscure albums. No surprises here. There are five good cuts of the songs that got airplay, but I found nothing compelling on the rest of the CD. On first listen, the other tracks seemed like unbridled moaning. That may punctuate the hits well, but gets annoying when the song is weak.After a couple more plays, I could accept the mood that was being projected, but I still couldn't warm up to the other songs. I'll bet these songs play better in a night club. Anita Baker is a good artist, but she needs better producers."
4,fair,"The author is more generous than I would be to the APA and the phychological dilemma that is homosexuality. He examines questions that since the 1970's should have been in the purview of the APA, an organization that has relinquished its responsibility in this matter to the detriment of all involved and society as a whole. Unfortunately the gay agenda has filled the vacuum with political answers to questions that should have been thoroughly studied and resolved by scientists, real scientists. Still, the author's thoughts on the subject are worthy of consideration and would contribute to understanding of the subject...unless your mind has been closed by the convenient answers supplied by those who are telling you what you want to hear."
1,AWFUL. Want a REFUND!,"Could not even watch do to AWFUL streaming. 10 seconds of movie, 2 minutes filtering. RIDICULOUS. Had to rent elsewhere as could not watch here in full."
5,Twelve Angry Men - Better Than Hitchcock,"Twelve Angry Men is a movie that weaves an interesting study of human relations and leadership into a life or death decision. Henry Fonda is brilliant as the man who helps guide a jury of ""angry"" men to an appropriate conclusion for the case. Terrific acting performances by a number of other well-known actors round out a provocative script. Enjoy it. Study it. Learn from it."
3,Grainy,"One of my favorite movies But- For the high price of this B&W movie, I was very surprised at the amount of grain in the picture. It's the grainiest I've ever seen. For this reason and the high price I only give it 3 stars."
2,Lots of acting talent...,"...can't help this preachy, talky and ultimately boring film. About the unfairness of stereotypes, the movie is filled with trite stereotypical characters. Although it would be tempting to call this film dated, I suspect it was a bit of a ""trial"" to watch, even in 1957. Viewing it once as a curiosity is definitely enough."
4,Bejeweled Game,"The game I ordered was received in quick time. It was a gift for my friend in Australia. It was not available in Werribee, Australia. He is over 60yrs. old and is having fun playing it every day to pass the time away and keep his mind alert."
4,Interesting game that doesn't get boring.,Actually this is a replacement. A friend made off with my original copy. I like it because I have the feeling that it is improving brain function. The combination of colors and searching for matching colors is a challenge. There is never any repetition which keeps my attention.
5,Great game,Bought it for my wife. She plays it all the time. She wasn't a gamer til I bought her this
4,"""Just Grand""","Since this movie has been one of my favorites for years, I just finally got around to getting the soundtrack(shame on me!). The only sad part for me was that it isn't the exact recording from the movie but then I realized that some of the songs aren't complete in the movie so I understand why. Though I love Julie Andrews, the first track I listened to was ""Chicago"" sung by Leslie Ann Warren. Sound quality was pretty good but not perfect(recorded at a lower volume). Still think it's a must have for fans of this movie!"
3,"Not so sour, but pretty tasty","My friends and I were quite disappointed when our bag of sour gummy cherries arrived. I love all the regular Haribo products but this is one I had never tried.Alas, the sour powder was more of a sugar topping. Not sour at all!Haribo makes good gummy candy, but saying these are sour is quite misleading!"
1,"2 Much sugar, No Sour twang at all!!","I was very dissapointed with these so called ""Sour Cherry Gummies"", as an avid haribo Gummy Fan, I was expecting at least some type of sour taste, instead just overly sweet and sugar coated, not even much Cherry flavor just very very sweet and overwhelming sugar flavor.If u want some gummies that r sour and tangy, try Fizzy Cola bottles!!They still have sugar coating but a very good, not 2 sweet tangy and tart flavor!! Enjoy...."
4,Oh YEAH!!!,I was waiting for a PPV event like this.It was okay but honestly the main event inda sucked.You know Vince aint just gonna fire Austin like that.
2,Very bad,The PPV was riding on it's main event and the main event was horrible. There wasn't any good matches. Mankind and Shamrock was really bad. They really did a bad job.
1,worst pay per viewever,THIS PAY PER VIEW IS HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY THIS RENT IT FIRST AND DONT BUY THIS HORRIBL PAY PER VIEW PLEASE!!!!!!!!!
2,WWF In Your House : Judgment Day,"To be quite honest, what looked promising on paper, turned out to be a complete shambles. For a main event pitting a re-hash of Austin / 'Taker / Kane, one has to look to the undercard for a sign of hope. Unfortunately, aside from a bearable match between the Outlaws and the 'Bangers, and X-Pac taking on D-Lo, everything else was way under par. Even The Rock failed to save the proceedings with a miserable bout with glorified squash boy Mark Henry. Half the problem is that half the matches were berefit of meaning or they were re-hashes of yesteryear. Ok, so the ending to the main event was surprising, but after putting everyone to sleep beforehand...I don't know what management were thinking when they signed the matches for this card. Oh dear...lets hope Survivor Series isn't as dismal as this!"
3,Judgement day is a good show but not one of the years best,"Judgement day is a good show but not the best.The show had some good matches in xpac vs dlo brown,goldust vs val venis and mankind vs shamrock.But the show is let down by some bad matches and a bad main event.Recommened if you really want to see it."
4,A fantastic event!,"Undertaker battles Kane to determine a NEW WWF CHAMPION! All 5 WWF Titles are on the line at this event! Ken Shamrock takes on Mankind for the WWF Intercontinental Title and D-Lo Brown defends the WWF European Title against X-Pac! Also, New Age Outlaws vs. Headbangers for the WWF Tag Team Titles and witness the first ever change in hands of the WWF Lightweight Title as Christian takes on the champ TAKA Michinoku! Also at this event, Rock vs. Mark Henry, Goldust vs. Val Venis, LOD 2000 vs. DOA in a six man tag and Marc Mero vs. Al Snow. One of the best IYH shows of the year!"
3,A EVENT WITH STONE COLD AS THE REF.,THE LAST THREE MATCHS WHERE GREAT. THE KEN SHAMROCK MATCH WAS FOR THE IC BELT. I THINK THE ROCK VS MARK HENRY MATCH WAS FUNNY AND GOOD.AND THE MAIN EVENT THE UNDERTAKER VS HIS BROTHER KANE WAS SLOW AND KIND OF GOOD.THE BEST PART OF THIS TAPE IS WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THE MAIN EVENT. FIREWORKS PS BUY THIS TAPE FOR THE FIREWORKS.
2,"Great Musicians, Strange Approach","Sometimes you get fooled by the sample audio files on Amazon and this is one of those times. The musicians are top notch prog-rockers. That being said, I find their approach off-putting. The first cut in particular starts great and morphs into a sugary pop love song duet that makes you want to puke! What were they thinking? There are some good cuts. However, their music is nowhere near that of IQ, Spock's Beard or any of the other prog rock bands."
1,not good,I BOUGHT THIS PRINTER SET IT UP IT WAS VERY EASY RAN OUT OF RED INK (WITH NO BACKROUND IMAGES ON) AFTER 25 COPIES. PLUS IT TAKES BETWEEN 8+12MINUTES PER PAGE OFF MY WEB TV. IM VERY DISSAPOINTED THEN I FIND OUT A NEW INK CAT. IS [spendy]...[I PAID ALMOST THAT MUCH FOR THE PRINTER]
1,Sunex socket 3/4 drive end is too small,The Sunex 0428 3/4-Inch Drive 15/16-Inch Impact Socket purchased along with a CP 772H 3/4 inch impact wrench was almost impossible to get onto the shaft of the impact wrench. Was told to call CP. CP provided two FREE sockets both of which would go onto and off of the CP772H much more easily. The Sunex socket 3/4 inch drive end of the socket is apparently too small by 1/64 inch or so.
2,The Seasoning of a Snob,"Speaking as a chef, I came away from Psaltis's book thinking that this is a guy I would not want to work with in the kitchen. The precious few insights he offered into the real workings of some wonderful kitchens were interesting, but he wound up the telling of every part of his professional life (except his time with Ducasse) by telling us that while that particular chef and his staff obviously meant well, they did not have the true commitment to preparing and presenting great food like Psaltis himself did. (His favorite backhanded compliment went something like, While that may be fine for some kitchens, it wasn't up to my standards.)By the end of the book, I had grown weary of Psaltis's snobbish take that no one else could live up to his standards. If he walked into my kitchen with that attitude, he wouldn't last five minutes."
4,Great for relaxation,I have enjoyed using this DVD during my recent IVF cycles. It has helped me relax but I'm still not pregnant (not that that's the fault of the dvd). The techniques used are very easy to follow along with and do. I love the visualization technique section--super relaxing. Great dvd and highly recommend if you need help in the relaxing department.
3,Audition before buying...,"Essentially, this is the middle free improvisation section of Thrak from various concerts strung together into a seamless hour or so of free rock improvisation.If you like Ornette Coleman's free jazz, or some of Sonic Youth's improvisational music from their SYR series, there's a good chance you'll like this. I like both of the above, and find this CD to be not quite of the same caliber musically (it was never intended to be a single composition in the first place), but enjoyable nonetheless.But, there's really no way to guarantee whether you'll like this album (even if you're a KC fan), so I recommend actually hearing it before you buy if possible."
2,This is where it all falls apart,"This is the first real sign of wanking overtaking inspiration.A whole lot of playing, not a whole lot listenable."
2,Sometime Ridiculous,"I was a little embarassed with the type of words that are suggested. Stuff about Mother Earth and similar ""hippy"" terms that to me are not erotic. There are a few suggestive phrases that have helped me open up and come up with my own ideas. But this is really a starter book and should be much less expensive then it is. Money-wise, I felt I was ripped off. I have looked at some of these word suggestions and laughed! There is no way I could say a few of these things without busting out laughing (the wrong way) during sex! An ok book, but not one I would recommend unless the price drops considerably. I also bought mine used, but clearly should've bought it cheaper!"
3,Much Bigger than Expected,"From the picture of this, I thought it was going to be very small and was shocked to find out its about a foot long.It says 4 different things, which get boring pretty fast.An ok toy for toddlers, but not much else."
4,Finally On DVD,"When I was a teenager I used to have the VHS tape of this, but over the years I lost it. I'm glad that they finally released it on DVD. It's as good as I remember it to be, especially the epic ""Rhyme Of The Ancient Mariner"". This concert depicts Maiden at the height of their popularity back in the mid '80's. I know they are on tour right now and think it's a shame that they aren't coming to my neck of the woods. This concert footage shows why Maiden are still to this day one of the best live acts around. My only gripe with this release was it isn't in anamorphic widescreen. I recommend this whole heartedly to anyone who wants to see a band give 110% and never sold out. Up The Irons!"
2,case broken.,cas was broken when i got dvd.Nothing wrong with dvd but inside dvd holder was broken.And if i not look after i will lostit and i dont want to buy AGAIN so its better look after.
3,Good music,"good show, but i only give it 3 stars because of the singing. Never a big fan of bruce's live singing."
5,Awesome LIVE album!,"After buying this LP originally in 1985 I purchased it again recently on CD to burn to my computer. This is one is meant to be played loud. Its also a good workout CD. I especially like the tracks Aces High, Run To the Hills, 2 Minutes To Midnight, and The Trooper just to name a few. It was recorded in Long Beach, CA in 1985. I would highly recommend this CD to anyone that likes metal."
4,"nice and purple, thin","The gloves are nice and purple, thinner than I expected , however, I trust Playtex quality and they are all of what will be between me and my electric stove when I clean it, so - They are still rubber, the latex part is troubling though. But they are textured at the fingertips and I'll try them out soon. I am pleased with the seller."
1,A real rip-off,"The first problem here is all the errors. Gosh, there must be one on nearly every other page. They're not major ones, but they shouldn't be there nonetheless.The second problem is the shallow coverage. Many important topics are not mentioned at all or glossed over. You *won't* learn to write SQL Server 2000 procedures by reading this book.The third problem is the SS2K coverage - it's barely there. Many workarounds are shown for things that SS2K makes obsolete anyway. Obviously the book was written for SQL 7.0, then reworked for SS2K. Sorry guys, you missed the mark.The book does not do what it claims to and is the worst computing book I've bought in a long, long time. I'm returning this rip-off to get my money back."
1,Awfully bad,"This is very easily the worst SQL Server book around. It's absolutely loaded with rubbish. A full listing of all the junk in this book would take a book itself, but I'll give you one that really takes the cake. It's a tip on page 358:""Rules are made to be broken, but only if the solution is thereby improved.""No, rules are _not_ made to be broken. They're _made_ to be followed, hence the term ""rules."" _Sometimes_ rules _are_ broken, but that is not their innate purpose. The rest of the world knows this. These guys apparently do not. The book is full of cliched, trite stuff like this. What it's not full of is useful technical info. You get lots of nice pictures of Query Analyzer and Visual Source Safe, but very little real technical help. If you buy the book expecting to learn how to write stored procedures, you will be sadly mistaken."
1,Not worth the (very thick) paper it's printed on,This book was a complete waste of my time. There's nothing here that you couldn't get from the BOL - nothing. It's a badly written rehash of the BOL - nothing more.
4,Lexmark printer,"Excellent printer so far. Very good printer resolution. Can become a network printer. I had problem with HP for this type of feeding tray. It fed 2-3 papers at one time when the printer got older. Hopefully, lexmark printer will not have this problem. If anyone have problem with feeding paper, please let me know."
5,White Collar season 3 is entertaining,Show has story lines that keep you thinking and just enough fun to keep you laughing along the way. Enjoyed watching.
5,white collar,"I didn't know this dvd set existed! I thought the show ended in 2010, so I was surprised when the new season was released. The dvd was shipped on time and in great condition."
1,"White Collar one of the ""cleaner"" TV crime series","I'm responding to the negative original review and the so-called increase in sexuality and profanity. What show were you looking at? Even if there was an increase, it's still one of the cleanest things one can watch on TV. And to add to that, the naysayers are talking about a decrease in quality in the series. I hope nobody's taking these comments seriously at USA. In both White Collar and Royal Pains, they have two of the most entertaining and clever TV series ever seen on American TV."
3,Luxmo Clear Snap On Cover Case With Bling Crystals for Motorola Razr v3/v3c/v3m,"I bought this phone cover for my wife and it fits her razr v3m perfectly. But, the crystals are prone to coming loose and falling out and the plastic can crack easily if dropped or bumped around, need to be gentle with it. I had these issues in the first 30 days and the merchant sent me a replacement. This cover is a great value since most retail store prices are appx $20. The crystals really shine and my wife is constantly asked in public if they are real jewels."
5,Wrong Size,"Nice quality, great service from the company. I allowed my daughter to pick out her skirts and I did not review what she picked out. Unfortunately she confused the size and we returned the product."
3,My eyelashes fell trying to stay awake,"I loved the concept of this book...a war which is all but forgotten by this country. The author, David Nevin is obviously very well informed on this subject. The problem with this book is that there was too much detail in every passage. The novel was supposed to deal with the war, not the inner thinkings of six characters, which is far too many. It was almost like reading a textbook. If he would have split the book into a trilogy, it would have been quite entertaining, but he bogged me down with so much information that my mind wandered often, most of the time making me very sleepy. I would suggest this book only to people who have an incredible sense of focus when reading. Researchers and paralegals come to mind. It was a good concept but a lousy product"
5,"The more than 30 basketball drills include shooting, ball-handling, passing, defensive moves, offensive moves, and more","With a total running time of 30 minutes, Driveway Basketball Drills produced by Marty Schupak and the Youth Sports Club is an impressively coherent visual compilation of creative drills and games that young basketball enthusiasts can perform in their own driveway, in their school gyms, or at community/neighborhood basketball courts. The more than 30 basketball drills include shooting, ball-handling, passing, defensive moves, offensive moves, and more. In addition to the drills themselves, Driveway Basketball Drills also showcases different forms of creativity using household props that will help young players acquire and hone their ball handling skills and performance with other aspects of the game. Driveway Basketball Drills is especially recommended for personal, community center, and school physical education department basketball instruction collections."
1,Does Not Work!,"So this product does not work at all for sunburns. I mean, nothing will numb the pain of a sunburn completely but this doesn't even numb it a little. I sprayed in on my back and all it did was create a mist of medicine in the air. It doesn't stick to skin at all. I held it about 3 inches away and finally the medicine started to stay on my skin but still didn't do squat. I'm still in just as much pain as I was before using it. Waste of money!"
5,Excellent series!,Excellent series if you like British mysteries and the locations are stunning! There are plenty of twists and the characters are well created and well played.
4,Vera- Very Good!,"Very good addition to British Murder Mystery Genre. Especially like the realistic gritty nature of the murders and that Vera is a real person. This is no slick snappy snazzy detective show where everything is glib conversation and a flourish finish. The Northumberland setting is broad vistas, grey, wet and tricky. Each story gets better. Hope there is more to come!"
4,First Time Reading Ms. Wesley,"This is the first novel I've read by Ms. Wesley. I have approximately 20 more pages to go, and I am thoroughly enjoying the read. The story has some twists and turns that kept me guessing. This is an older book, I see. So I am the first reviewer. I recommend this book for an interesting few hours of entertaining reading."
3,Strictly a Reference book only...,"I took this book as it was a recommended book for one my courses.. i thought it would be same as other text books, where you actually LEARN THRU THE BOOK..But this book is STRICTLY for a reference purpose.. I had to take another book to learn the basics of XML.. also, the net tutorials helped a lot..Though, as a reference book, I'll give full points to it.. once you have the basic knowledge about XML, you can really use this book to its optimum level, and it really helps you to refer ALL the types in XML..So if you are starting to learn XML, I would advise to take a simpler book, like ""XML Applications"" and go through the net too.. but once you are done with the basics, buy this book the very next day, and check out what all wonders you can do through XML!!!..."
4,Dressy & Comfortable,"These shoes are definitely comfortable. The adjustable strap is a plus and has never been a problem. I almost always wear socks with the shoes because my feet sweat when I don't. Although, if I powder my feet and the shoes and don't wear them for more than half a day then everythings okay. The little tab located at the back of the shoe sometimes get caught on my pants hem. Just a little annoyance but doesn't always occur. I would advise spraying the shoe with protectant because they tend to pick up dirt fairly easily. I live where it rains a lot so I always spray fabric shoes anyway. Overall I am very satified and would recommend these shoes."
3,Some,"Great songs and a good find overall, however some of the songs are not my taste and not what I am looking for when I want Soviet inspiration."
2,Marching Music,I love the Soviet National Anthem. I was hoping for more marching music instead of Russian folk songs incorporating the balaika.
4,Brought back memories:,"I bought this for my parents for a gift. They loved going through the box remembering the different kind of candies. It was enjoyable watching them fight over the ""good"" stuff."
2,Ugh!,"No value - too much of the least favorite, cheaper candy and you do not get enough to justify the cost.."
5,Very impressed!,"Candy set arrived, packaged very well--so well that I left my first ever positive packaging feedback! The box was surprisingly heavy, and pretty full, it only had paper stuffing at the top, where the box is triangular...so yes, the box is pretty full. The candy set was a good mix of full-size and trial size candies, many of which I'd never heard of, some that I remember seeing when I was really young. It's a good mix for a gift because they can taste a little of this and a little of that, or share, etc. Very satisfied, will likely be ordering more for gifts in the future!"
1,Schizm - Dreamcatcher Disappointment ZERO STARS,"Pass on this one. This game is ego-driven by the creator. It is not fun entertainment. This game has inane puzzles for the sake of puzzles. The puzzles do not follow any logical order. Parts of each puzzle are not in the same area so you must solve the puzzle part here and then go there to solve the puzzle to complete the whole puzzle! A lot of backtracking. You must ""move"" both characters separately - very repetitive. Huge mathematical equations that go on and on to complete a task. This game contains a puzzle in which you must beat the computer. Until you do (twice in a row) you are stuck and cannot go any further in the game. I feel that there are only two good things about this game (1) If you want to solve this game you can purchase the cheats for an additional $... from the company and (2) this was a gift - I did not waste my money on it."
2,ummm- does this make the slightest bit of sense,"While the gameplay was enjoyable, and the puzzles may have been difficult- I needed help and I had gotten through Riven and Myst III in 2 days a piece, I found that I could not get into the fun. The tasks seemed more laborious than puzzles, and the graphics were absolutely terrible. I found it difficult and annoying to change characters and disliked the funky camera angles. At some points, you seem 5 feet off the ground and at others about 8. The storyline was also terrible- I still do not completely understand what the logic is behind what happened where and who the heck the gatekeeper and Matia are. There are also no ways to fail- failure is an option in real life.The main purpose for buying this game was to see great graphics, piece together a great storyline, and to tackle mediocre to hard puzzles. This game provided none of the above. Yuck"
2,save your money unless you're a masochist,"Like many before me, I give mixed reviews because this is both good and bad. The bad outweighs the good overall because the bad is so, well, BAD! I thought the music and graphics were gorgeous. I found the cursor was difficult to use. It took me two or three tries and reinstalls to realise the problem was you needed to swing the cursor left and right to get a response. Bizarre. I found the puzzles had no relation to the environment, and that really put me off. I spent a few hours and solved the first two puzzles by guesswork. That is not what I want the game for; I want to use the old noodle, but not merely guess. It almost seemed random, but since I didn't go through it all, I cannot say for certain if that were the case or not. Overall, any of the Myst games would be preferable."
1,imported cheap connectors,"I tried this connector. It was made of imported cheap brass and and the grip was stiff and plastic. Also, it did not fit together well and was hard to connect. All-in-all I felt that it was unsafe and was worth $3.00; not the 13.00 I paid."
4,H4,Product arrived in great condition and very timely. Lots of songs though some mentioned in the liner notes were not on the CD's. Still basically what I expected...
3,Inadequate Overview of a Really Nifty Band....,"Before there was Cheryl, before there was Alanis, before there was, uh, Courtney, there was Tanya Donelly; a woman of enchanting baby-voice and unusually resonant cutie-osity (sigh..) Her and her band, Belly, sent the then-thriving alternative rock scene on its ear with the 1993 release of ""Star,"" an album that is sorely underrepresented on this release (no ""White Belly?,"") What we get here isn't really a best of at all but a smattering of radio hits (""Feed the Tree,"" ""Ghepetto,"") and heaping helping of arcane b-sides that belong more on second and third printings of ""Star"" and 1996's(?) ""King"" than on a ""Best Of"" release. Though it is basically a disappointment, I reccomend it to hard core Tanya-philes on the basis of the interesting covers (Hot Burrito 1) and maybe to the Belly beginner, just listen to the above mentioned singles and ""Full Moon, Empty Heart"" and ""Slow Dog"" before you pass judgement ; )."
5,Belly Fans Are The Greatest,"I love reading these reviews. I think Belly fans are the most interesting and thoughtful people in the world. Some may quibble about the tracks selected. At first, I was disappointed that some favorite album tracks were left out. The track selection is genius because the hits are all there for the hit seekers and it collects Belly's excellent b-sides and covers in one place. Those high quality b-sides and covers, along with the hits, help make this both a fine introduction and a one stop shopping center for completists. I can only fault this collection for leaving out The Bees-Live. Luckily, I have it on an ep. ..."
4,informative and helpful,The maps and charts in this altas are fabulous. The historical and geographical explanations are vey informative.
5,AMAZING!!,Get ready quilters because this pattern is addictive. There is so much you can do with it. Mary Ellen's instructions are very easy to follow and just by twisting and turning one square you can have several different turn-outs. She also shows ways to make the prettiest stars by using the Kansas Dugouts. I don't think anyone should be without this book in their collection. It's an adventure every time you open the book.
4,Easy to use; a little loose for smaller players,"The armband works well- easy to use and tight enough for my moderately small arm. I got one of these for myself and my daughter. My player is a small Sony Walkman, hers an ipod mini. In both cases we needed to stuff some filler in to keep the players from sliding out when we are doing exercises. If you are only running, probably not a problem, but if you get upside down a little the thinner players can slide out without some stuffing added. But all in all easy and inexpensive and works fine."
1,Doesn't work nearly as well as name brand stuff,"I tried this due to the huge cost savings over Tinactin (or even the Walgreen's generic equivalent, which works just as well). The stuff simply didn't work. My athlete's foot actually got worse while I was using it. Within two days of switching back to the Walgreen's generic my AF was well under control again. My theory is that though the antifungal may be present in the advertised amount that perhaps the base makes it less effective. This stuff is extremely watery in its make up compared to what comes in a Tinactin or Walgreen's tube (much thicker). All I know is unfortunately I won't be using it again."
1,Not what I was expecting,"I normally love travel essays, but this one was unexpectedly boring. The cover made me think it was going to be thrilling and exciting, but it was just a bunch of articles the author had published elsewhere and lumped into this book.I only got through the first two articles before putting the book down and never picking it up again. I've been looking for a great woman travel writer, but I'm sad to say I didn't find it in Susan Orlean. Perhaps if she'd started the book of with something more interesting to me I'd have been able to get into it more."
2,Playtex gloves,I have average sized hands and the Playtex XL is too tight. Playtex need to make an XXL for men.
2,Blah,"My father and I have dishydrosis, we have to wear gloves to do dishes. These gloves fit very small. They are also rather short, so if you move wrong you will get water in your gloves and defeat the purpose of wearing the gloves! These aren't bad in a pinch from the grocery store, but I wouldn't waste my money ordering these off the internet. There are lots of other gloves available, take the time to look for something better!"
2,An Unquiet Mind,"I had to read this book for class and I found it somewhat dry. Although the topic is not the most action-packed persay, it was not as descriptive as I would have hoped. I was able to use it to write a lengthy paper, so I guess it did have some of the information I was hoping to find but as a whole I have read better books covering the topic of manic-depressive illness."
2,"I thought I was going to like her more, not less...","This book got very tiresome as she went back again and again to the same ideas. Even the ""new"" men in her life didn't seem so new. I truly do applaud her resilience and perseverence, but I'm not so sure I'm glad I read about it."
5,Tricked into membership,"Was excited to find the book I was looking for, even more when I was offered a $5.00 coupon for the $5.00 book. Much to my surprise I had been charged $9.00 (or so) for a membership into something--not sure what it was--that was going to cost me $9.00 a month. I immediately called the number on the product ad and wanted the membership cancelled immediately. Am waiting to see if the amount will be withdrawn next month. I didn't see anything about a membership, and feel stupid for being duped into this. Please don't let this happen to you. The seller was Discount Booksale.com, phone #866-707-5888."
4,A Better Understanding,"The book was interesting and revealing. I got bogged down a couple of times with details that I could not relate to but this book really helped me see my daughter's issues through a new set of eyes, eyes of someone who truly experiences this same illness."
5,rest easy,This book was a mirror into my soul. How comforting to read the journey from the viewpoint of one that is disturbed by this illness and how wonderful and uplifting to see how victorious you are in achieving such great health. You have captured the essence of what it is like to go through this disease and I thank you for such wonderful honesty and I wish you good mental and physical health all of your life.
2,Flat and uninspiring,"If this were a fiction book, I would critique it on the basis that the main character is painfully one-dimensional, and as another reviewer wrote, somewhat self-centered. The fact that this is actually a memoir is not a good sign since memoirs are an opportunity for authors to explore their own uniqueness and get beyond narrative cliches. Its a pity that she has applied such a normative frame to understanding the complications of her life, and unless you are totally comfortable with the narrow ambitions and desires of a ""normal"" bourgeois life, you probably won't find this book compelling."
3,not what I expected,"I am bipolar and this book was recommended by my doctor. I was hoping for a book that shared thoughts and experiences similar to what I have been through; instead I feel that she focused too much on her relationships and how people responded to her illness rather than her actual experiences with it. She is an academic and I felt that she was writing to other academics rather than the average person. Her language choice sometimes made the book cumbersome and boring and I never felt the connection with her as a person that I had been looking for. While I appreciate her honesty and willingness to share something so personal, and there were bits here and there that I could relate to, I did not really enjoy reading this book as much as I thought I would."
3,"Good, but......","The content of the book is good. The details are medically/psychologically accurate. And I am interested in the topic. However, I could not get into this book. It did not flow like a story to me. I managed to get through the book by skipping parts and reading it not in order, but the enjoyment of the story was lost on me. This book was recommended to me based on my interest in Left Neglect by Lisa Genova. Genova's book is just like this one - good, accurate, etc... However it reads quickly and flows in my opinion. So I recommend this book if you are interested in the topic, just know that it might take a chapter or so to get into it."
1,The Authoress is a drunk and a hypocrite,"One of the first rules of psycho-pharmacology is that you do not mix alcholic beverages with antidepressants or other mood altering drugs. Ms. Jamison does not seem to know this -- or is ignoring this very well know fact -- since she is clearly boozing her way through the story and her ensuing manic depressive episodes. No wonder she's nuts. She belongs ""inpatient""."
4,Intensely emotional,"This book affected me to the core. I have read many other books ""about"" bipolar, but realize now that I received the information very clinically. Passages in this book were written in a fashion as though the author were in my head. They were my thoughts!! Very eerie. I cried through much of it, but was so grateful to hear virtually my own experience being explained. The book combines science with a personal touch in a very courageous manner. For me, it was deeply touching, and very helpful. I will remain truly grateful for the insights I gained."
4,Great delivery service,Great deilivery service for a bookI wantedto receivefast!Wanted toread agood interpretation of anexperts self.
4,Salute to courageous fighter,"Dr. Jamison risks her professional standing by being so upfront about her illness. Yet she lays it out in the hope of helping others with the same problems. And I think that she IShelping others. In ""Personal History"", Katharine Graham cites Jamison's work, and it helps Graham's healing by giving her (Graham) further insights into her late husband's wild mood swings and action prior to his suicide. I wish Jamison wouldn't be quite so hard on herself. If she were able to grasp the concept of a higher power, she might begin to discern some of the peace which she so richly deserves."
1,Boring and irrelevant,"I had to read this book for my graduate psychopathology class. The book was supposed to provide experential content about bipolar disorder. Well, this book is mainly composed of trivial events like dinner parties or visits to England, rather than a description of bipolar disorder. Whenever bipolar disorder (or manic-depression, as the author calls it) is discussed, it's in vapid, over-the-top poetic terms, like ""it was a wave of bleak foul despairing madness, an eruption of manic volcanic fury"". The author uses four adjectives where one or even none would suffice, making me groan with every paragraph. I have never read a book before that said so much and yet said so little. Don't read it unless you have to, and if you have to, here's a tip: the first 3/4 of the book are totally unimportant."
2,Mildly informative extrordinarily pretentious,"Having recently read many text, autobiographical, and various memoirs on psychiatric illness; I found Dr. Jamison's ""The Unquiet Mind"", to be more pretentious than anything I have ever read. It was difficult to empathize or identify with her, due to the constant and obviously purposeful references to the fact that she is more intelligent, more cultured, more creative, and more capable than most human beings.Every other sentence in the book makes a point that you must realize, she listens and appreciates classical music,fine art, gourmet foods and knows all literature and poetry of any consequence.She never actually details any real episodes in her life, nor does she describe any relationship of any value with another human being (exception her mother) that does not have a doctoral degree.How anyone could label this memoir an actual ""memoir"" in my mind is ludicrous. It is a self-indulgent, self-important rambling of ""big words"" that say nothing."
3,It's alright.....,"But it talked *A LOT* about her life and not much about bipolar/manic depression. I don't care about her time studying in England, falling in love etc, as I thought it was more about living life with bp. Despite being a psychologist, she doesn't spend a lot of time actually talking about how she has to deal with the subject on a daily basis."
2,Repetitive and poorly written,"This book was selected for my book club, so dutifully I plowed through an unenlightening, ungrammatical and repetitive story of one woman's struggle with manic-depression illness. The writing was choppy, her poor use of punctuation was infuriating, and her style left much to be desired. The story seemed to end halfway through the book, leaving me to wonder what was left to tell in the second half - much to my dismay it was basically a repeat of previously provided information, or more detail on episodes already described. It was all I could do not to throw the book across the room in frustration! I can see how this book might be helpful for those who suffer from this illness, but Jamison needs to stick to textbook and article writing, and leave the layman's books to those who know how to write."
5,great book,"I read this book when a dear friend was admitted to the hospital with bi-polar issues. It was so fascinating that I read it almost in one sitting. Kay Jamison's honest, open writing allows the reader to get a clear picture of what someone having bipolar episodes is going through. It's one of those books that will always stick with me."
1,Beware these gloves leave marks on stainless steel!,These gloves left cross hatch marks on my stainless all-clad cookware and the top of my french press coffeemaker. The only thing that removed them was goo gone. Needless to say I will not be using these gloves again for doing dishes. I am not going to use a product that adds time and aggravation to my cleaning.
1,Horrible gloves,"I would actually give this product a zero star rating but not sure I can do that. I finally figured out that these gloves were the reason that all my glassware looks terrible with residue. I thought it was hard water and had cleaned glassware in vinegar without much improvement. Once I used ""De-solve"" or ""GooGone"" the glassware looked terrific. However, the key was that I had to do it WITHOUT the gloves on. The moment I used the gloves again it left the same residue. I spent about three hours this morning cleaning all of my glassware and it all looks like new. I did this AFTER I threw away the gloves. Extremely disappointing."
3,A scanner a bit confusingly.,"I found this book a bit confusing. However, the moral and theme of the book are very obvious. Even though Philip K. says there is no moral. As hard of a read as this book is I found myself plowing through it and being entertained for reasons I'm not sure of. Somehow Dick is able to keep my attention even when I'm not completely sure what is happening and why. To be honest I'm not sure why I even gave this book as many as three stars. The plot is very confusing and the subplots are abandoned as soon as they become interesting. I think the concept of this book is so imaginitive that it saves the book. That is true with many Sci-fi books."
5,Trippy mane,Im drug free but it just feels like I injected a very potent narcotic into my veins. What a trip.
2,Not Androids,"I, too, loved Androids. I hoped that all of Dick's stuff would be as good. Not so.A lot of the time, I had no idea what was going on. I got hung up on the date of 1994; everyone says things like ""dig"" and listens to Cat Stevens music. I wish he hadn't told us a date.Not a page turner. For serious fans only."
4,great cotton knits,As always Debbie Bliss has some great patterns and styles in this book. Her styles lean more toward classic's. Great style that will stay in fashion for a long time.
4,surprisingly impressed,"I loved Ben Watt's contribution to Lazy Dog I and hated Jay Hannan's. Thus, hearing that he has a good house CD is a relief. It's not that this disc has individual jams that I just had to have. This is just a decent CD if you want to listen to an hour's worth of house. It would be a good set at any club. Nothing revolutionary happens on this disc. However, I don't regret buying it. It was enjoyable, despite not being extraordinary. Long live the deep house sound!"
4,Great follow up to his work on Lazy Dog,"Very good CD, especially the middle tracks, and recommend it for anyone who enjoyed the Lazy Dog CD's."
5,Excellent beginner guitar,"The reason this guitar got five stars was that I judged it against it's price. Now, obviously, a $50 guitar is not going to wow anyone, but for a beginner, this is an excellent buy. It produces a decent sound, it made from basswood/linden wood, and best of all the price is dirt cheap. If you are looking for a beginner classical guitar, this is the way to go. Just change to strings and the guitar is a good a deal as you will find. I plan to upgrade latter, but will still keep this guitar as a travel instrument."
1,Waste of time-x.,"I bought this a little over a 10 months ago and had to send it back twice. When it worked it was great. Although the booklet that came with it was less than adequate and in some places hard to understand I liked the associated software, it was not a hinderance to use-running, walking or cycling. It just would not work after a month the first time and less than two weeks the second time. I have not gotten back yet but I do not have high hopes for it. Maybe I just got a bad one, but a lot of reviews I have read since are very similar to mine. Like I said, when it worked it was great and would have been an excellent addition to anyone's training regimen. I think I'll try Garmin next."
4,"Great documentaries, but not a big bump in quality.","Using actual 16mm and 8mm color footage from the 30's, 40's and 50's parts one and two is an engaging look at baseball during its so-called golden age. Celebrity narrators and former major leaguers are used on the soundtrack without cutting away from the archival film. Some of the players will probably not be familiar with modern audiences, but who cares. Just sit back and enjoy! Most of the early footage is form players and fans using non-professional cameras so don't expect high quality video. For this reason the blu-ray quality is not much better than the standard DVD version. Part three uses newer and higher quality sources, so the blu-ray bump is more noticable."
4,Very Interesting,"While it owes a huge debt of story to The Lord of the Rings, this take on the ""quest to handle the evil artifact"" story is different enough and entertaining enough to be worth a read."
3,50/50,I purchased quite a few of these and it seems that they are really hit and miss. They looked rather heavy duty. Since they were so cheap this is a case of you get what you pay for.
2,Woman Fairy,Do I understand that the banshee is a man? How peculiar! Banshee is from Gaelic 'ban-sith' which means 'woman fairy'. She cries or wails when a death is about to occur. The author needs to do a bit more research before the next book.
5,Sweet Science,"Way back, in my first year of high school, during a boring assembly in the auditorium, the monotony was suddenly broken by a rocked-up performance of a Christmas song (""Santa Claus is Coming To Town,"" if I remember correctly) by a young Paul Jago. Young girls swooned. Jago`s high falsetto voice became embossed in my brain. Not long after, Jago`s band, the Gandharvas, released this album, and with a little help from Muchmusic (Canada`s MTV), they garnered a little fame. As a live act, they were unmatched by their canuck contemporaries. Soap Bubble is experimental and quirky, and a very impressive first outing. Their potential wasn`t fully realized until their next album, Kicking in the Water, but this one is stunning nonetheless. Most songs are infectious from the get-go, and the psychotropic title track still remains, years later, a frequently-spun staple in my stereo. Sadly, the Gandharvas are now defunct, but this album remains a telling legacy to the rare treasure that the band was."
5,"You too, can get rythym...","Got my feet wet February '03 at a small intimate setting in Long Beach, Ca...the man knows blues...the man is very accessible...genuine and real...the whole rythym that makes the blues what they are...he was carrying on entire musical conversations with my girls and me...way too cool!! Never experienced Doug? Now's a good time to begin...I KNOW you won't be bummed...just a little BLUESed...from head bob to toe tappin..."
1,Shaving with Tweezers,"Total junk - with a 2 day old growth, shaving is as comfortable as pulling each whisker with a tweezers. I purchased this for a ~4 year old Remington R-950 originally equipped with rotating knife-edged cutters. Even after 4 years, the original out-cuts this design. Don't but - buy another brand of shaver first."
4,Don't Think I'm Not,"This is Kandi's first single off of her new album ""Hey, Kandi"" to be released September 12th, 2000. Once again, she has teamed up with songwriting partner Kevin Briggs. (Aka ""Shekespere"" - don't know if I spelled it right) These two are known for writing/producing other well known hits such as: There You Go (Pink), No Scrubs (TLC), Bills, Bills, Bills (Destiny's Child), Bug A Boo (Destiny's Child), No Pigeons (Sporty Thievez), and X-Girlfriend (Mariah Carey) - just to name a few. Both Kandi Buruss and Kevin Briggs are talented musicians and I am sure that they have both made contributions to Kandi's album, which will make it one that you won't want to pass up. - If you like hip-hop and/or r&b, this single as well as the album are right for you."
5,Great Song,"This is a really great song. Kandi has an excellent voice, and can really dance well. She used to be a member of Xscape, and is doing a great job now that she's on her own."
3,JOE MEEK INSTRUMENTALS,"TWO CD PACKAGE, 60 SELECTIONS OF INSTRUMENTAL MUSIC PRODUCED BY JOE MEEK IN THE EARLY 60'S IN MONO. THE SONGS RANGE FROM GREAT, TO GOOD, TO REALLY BAD. THAT'S WHY IT GETS THREE STARS."
3,The career of a CFL legend,"In this book there is a great deal of interest towards his career in the Canadian Football League which is fine as that is the league that he predominantly played in but there appears to be little coverage of his peronal life i.e. going into more depth about his childhood, his parents and later his wife and family. There are instances where he tells us how much he enjoys spending time with his family back in Boston but they don't follow up on this. I do like the quotes from all of his coaches and agents etc. They are on occasions funny and nearly always allow a follow up to what Doug felt about certain circumstances. Overall the book was easy enough to read, but, in my opinion was maybe of more interest to a follow of the CFL as to American Football in general."
3,Great Book for Flutie Fans,"If you like Doug Flutie, you will enjoy this book. Typical ""sports hero"" book... not extremely well written, will drag on at times unless you are a fanatic. Interesting read if you want to learn more about Doug Fluite."
5,Great practical guide,"This small book is worth its weight in gold for those who are interested in learning and understanding the practice of yoga. As a certified yoga instructor and an Educational Psychologist (PhD), I use this book exclusively with my clients who are new to the practice. The book is well written, informative, and includes many useful photographs to guide the beginning student toward a productive home practice. One of the most useful aspects of the book is the sequencing of poses for students that may lack the knowledge to create a series of movements at home. In addition, the author illustrates many basic yoga poses in detail, providing proper alignment and positioning for various levels of ability. I recommend this book highly."
4,A good intro MO theory book for some.,"This was one of the books used in my introductory freshman chemistry class at my university. It has highly informative, yet concise explanations covering the basics of molecular orbital theory. While I preferred this book to our other text for its conciseness, those without a good background in chemistry may have a difficult time with the book for the same reason. My only complaint about the book is that Gray uses CGS units instead of SI."
4,"good tea, no miracles",i like drinking this tea. i add some extra lemon grassi would think of this as a nice decaf green tea with some other herbs; you wont be able to feel difference in your joints
3,Another Angry Rock Band,"I've had hesitations about Astralwerks in the past couple of months based on the material they seem to be putting out lately (King Biscuit Time, Sunna, Phoenix, Graham Coxon, etc...). This album doesn't seem to fit with their usual roster. The album's not bad if you are a fan of Eve 6, Creed, or any other alternative band out there. In fact, for that population, it's a great album. However, for people seeking an electronic release, it's just an average album. Not horrible, not great."
1,Don't ...,"This album only offers one song worth listening to, and I don't feel obliged to check the title of it. other then that one song, it was a really excruciatingly boring CD. You wanna rock? pick up VAST's cd's. Don't bother here."
3,Wasn't that Bad,"Yeah this PPV gets a bad rap, but it ain't that bad. Sure, the main event is bogus, the Undertaker match isn't as good as it could have been, and the IC championship had one of the worst endings ever to an amazing match. Overall it was pretty fun. Macho Man and Bobby The Brain have some pretty funny banter and the fact its outside is pretty sweet. I'd chose Wrestlemania X over this, but its a must for any fan of the early 90s."
4,Nice Boots,"Great look. Easy on and off with the zipper (yeah) and pretty comfortable to wear as long as it is not ALL day, but then what boot is. Good for wearing before and after skiing, running out the door to do some shopping, etc.. Would recommend."
1,Fell apart-DON'T BUY!!!,"Since its snowing a lot here in UT I needed boots that weren't fashionable and useful. I saw these and thought they would be perfect with the rubber bottoms. The first day the right boot's zipper split and is still that way. Two weeks after still needing to wear them, the left zipper actually broke off. I don't even want to go through the return process for fear of having a brand new pair have zipper malfunctions. You have been warned."
1,Savage Agenda....but not Quaker simplicity,"A man who sets out to Walk however many hundred miles without proper preparation may not be too smart...however, there is no law against stupidity, so they say. But please, don't preach about the simplicity testimony when the first thing you do upon reaching the city is catch a cab. True plain Quakers live their lives with integrity, not with an agenda. As an aside, I couldn't help but feel sorry for his unregistered children when later in life they may want to claim citizenship...say to get a job...?"
5,Why hasn't someone done this before?,"I bought this for use in my garage workshop, to control a small gas wall furnace/space heater. The heater has its own thermostat, but it's not programmable and it's terribly inaccurate, prone to wide fluxuations in temperature. This device does a lovely job of keeping the shop comfortable when I expect to be there while letting the place cool off at night to save energy. It's lovely, and such a simple idea that I wonder who no other thermostat manufacturer seems to offer an equivalent product."
5,Wonderful item,"I have an electric fireplace but didn't realize it does not have a temp gage to cut off the heat---well,,,,problem solved!!!!it anyone needs an item like this..its great!!!!!!!!"
1,Failed quickly,"The device seems extremely sensitive to heat. My application is to have a fan switched on when the temperature exceeds a certain point. Unfortunately, the temperature continues to rise, and may (in a perfect storm) exceed 130F. The thermostat failed; fair enough: that exceeds the specs, but I'd hoped that since I didn't want anything fancy to happen in those elevated temperatures -- just hang in there until the temperature dropped -- it would do the job. Oh well."
1,Its a dud! Sounded nice.,"I tried and tried but could never get it working.It is not an intuitive device ANDmy friend who throughly read tried and failedto get it to work.Additionally, she said that settings would belost after a power failure!!!"
2,Great concept that fails,"The idea behind it is sound, use the heater only at the times you need it and have it shut off when the thermostat reaches the desired temperature. The problem is, the unit only stays as far away as the electrical cord, so it really doesn't measure overall room temp. You should use extension cords on heaters, so the product is not useful IMO."
5,Works great!,I purchased this for my mica heater in my bedroom and I have had it for about a week. It was easy to set up and it works great!
5,Lifesaver,"This product is a lifesaver. You program in your thermostat settings, plug it to the wall outlet, and then plug in your heater and turn it on. I bought this so I could program my heater for the time of day when my bedroom gets really chilly. It works great and has safety features that give me peace of mind. Great product!"
4,Reliable and Easy to Use,Nice product. I decided to buy four of these to use with portable space heaters. One of the four was defective (kept cycling the heater on and off) but Amazon promptly replaced. The devices themselves do what they are intended to do. Four stars (instead of five) because I don't know how accurate the thermostats are...I have independent (high quality) thermostat/thermometers that are usually 2-3 degrees off from this....I am prone to believe that the digital thermometers are correct. Overall a solid product. I don't regret purchasing.
2,BOTH of mine clunked out,"After 2-3 years, both units stopped working properly. They show proper temperature, but instead of powering my AC off when the trigger temperature is reached, the AC keeps running. They used to work for this application, and I have the settings set properly. They just stopped triggering the mechanism when they're supposed to."
3,WIN100 Heating & Cooling Programmable Outlet Thermostat,I connected this to 2 salamanders in the basement of a house I am working on so that the water would not freeze. I wanted to run it a few hours a day but the minimum temp setting is 45 degrees and there is no way to turn it lower so the heaters run most of the time. Not what I expected but the unit was easy to program and works fine.
3,Needs higher setting for cooling,"Fine item but if you want this for cooling and turning on an attic fan like I did it is does not have a high enough setting.The highest setting is 90 degrees and for a real hot attic like mine, I wanted a setting between 95 and 100 degrees before I wanted my fan to go on. Otherwise the item works fine. I am hoping that someday they will upgrade with a higher setting for cooling."
2,Not reliable to shut off,"I've gone through two of the WIN100's, to turn an exhaust fan on in my small greenhouse at 90 degrees, and both units will often not turn the fan off if the temperature gets over 100. That causes the fan to keep running into the night, bringing cold evening air in, which I definitely do not want! (Mostly orchids in the greenhouse). Since I can't always be around to be sure the WIN100 turned the fan off at 89 degrees, I have replace this with something reliable.In the winter I used this unit to turn a heater on when the temp gets below 58, and it seems to work properly at these lower temps, but it fails with temps over 100. (And I'm in Sacramento... 100 in the shade, outside, is not unusual). It's top set point is 90 degrees, and it fails at just 10 degrees above that?! I tried setting at 89 and 88, but same result; this is a thermostat that can't take the heat."
5,Great product. Fast shipping.,This is a great product and served it purpose very well. All these electric fireplaces they sell at store do not have a Dang thermostat to tell them to cut on and off at a certain temp. This solved our problem and keeps our vacation house master bedroom at a perfect 72 degrees. We programmed it to just turn on during weekends which saves us alot on power as well. Wonderful product and very affordable for the technology.
4,WIN100,The only reason that I did not rate this a full 5 stars is because the read out isn't accurate. Maybe there is a calibration I missed. I set the temperature to 72 to control a blower that supplies warm air to a remote room. The unit shuts off when the temperature in the room reaches 72 degrees according to the read out on the unit. The real temperature in the room measured next to the unit is only 66 degrees.
5,"Spimes, Documents and Folkonomies, oh my.","This was a fanastic read. Well thought out from cover to cover. This book is clearly written.Peter nailed a lot of issues that made me laugh out loud. I was enlgihtened many times over. The topics discussed are entirely true. The book captures right now.This is a killer read, and should be a required read for anyone that uses the net, Google, wikis, blogs, have implanted RFID's, create folders, traverse horizontal folksonomies, want spimes... you get the picture.Peter questions where did you find the book? For me, this find was 100% serendipitous. Way along the Long Tail from what initially was searching for..."
3,D H Lawrence in New Mexico,"While the subject of the book is of obvious interest to both D H Lawrence fans and people interested in Taos, NM (Lawrence's stays there have taken on a somewhat mythical significance and his ashes were taken back to Taos by his wife, Frieda), I found the book to be quite episodic. It seemed to have been written in a hurry, and I was particularly disappointed in the index.As one example, the author starts talking about Dorothy Brett (a friend from England) in Chapter One without telling the reader who she is, and the index doesn't help. I would have expected more from a book published by the University of New Mexico Press.This is still of great interest to people already familiar with Lawrence."
5,Excellent and enchanting!,This book is wonderful! It is for the true collector of fairy.... I am a true fan and have now purchased more of the series! LOVE IT!
1,Very disappointed,"This book offers nude fairey images and not much more, it's overpriced with little reward for the buyer - like the Emperor's New Clothes... you really need to believe to get value here."
4,Old favorite of mine,I bought this book when it first came out and fell in love with it. It's whimsical and funny with a lot of beautiful pictures as well! Worth every penny to me and you'll find me giving this as a gift to the friends I know who appreciate great art and humor.
4,Excellent read,"I'm going to agree with both reviews above (or below) mine. It is unsettling, it certainly has made me wonder how a major religion could spring from Jesus, when he's put into the context of his time. On the other hand, one needs to put Jesus into context in order to understand the Gospels. I am glad I read this book and will continue to read more of Prof. Horsley's books.As for the Imperial Rome/U.S. analogy, makes perfect sense to me. I've long thought that America is the new Imperial Rome. History always repeats itself...esp. when you have someone like George Bush in office."
4,Great candy to use for learning letters,We use the candy to as a dessert for our 3 year old son. He gets the candy after he can correctly identify the letter. He loves the candy. rrh
2,Stale!,"The Gummi Alphabet lettere are stale...almost completely hard. What a disappointment! They were for the grandkids, but no one could eat these very easily. Very surprised!"
5,A great treasure from the grunge era.,One listen of this cd and I found myself humming melodys hours later. I would recomend this band to anyone. from humor in the lyrics to catchy riffs. a very good band that somehow got overlooked during the grunge explosion of the 90's.
4,Justice,"Schorer's 1961 biography of Lewis, while well researched, came off as particularly mean-spirited. I could never understand why a biographer would take on the huge task of an exhaustive biography when they seem to distain it's subject so much.Finally Mr. Lingeman has given us a more even handed look at one of America's most neglected authors. Perhaps it was the great popularity of Lewis during the 1920's that brought about a more recent reaction against him but it seems that the time is ripe for another look at this most American of American authors and the Lingeman book makes that clear. This biography is clearly as in depth as Schorer's but, fortunately, does not have some strange axe to grind. Besides, the life of Sinclair Lewis makes for some interesting reading when it is put forth honestly."
2,Not as good..,The first Jesus Freaks is so much better. I always hate doing this to my own brethren but don't read this second book.
5,Soldiers for Christ!,"If this book doesn't compell you to get off your pew and be a ""Soldier for Jesus Christ"", I don't know which one will. (Other than the Holy Bible, of course.) It is an unbelievable collection of stories of men and women that have clearly ""fixed their eyes on Jesus"" and have perservered with the strength and determination of God. I could only read a few stories at a time. I'd sit in amazement and pray that the Lord would create in me that type of passion and courage for Him. I want to be counted in that number! I thank DC Talk for publishing that book. I will give that book away for Christmas presents - to both Christians and unbelievers. Awesome!"
5,GREAT BAND THAT DESERVES MORE PRAISE,"MY FAVORITE SONGS ON THE ALBUM ARE PIPEDREAM AND HERONS. HER VOICE IS AMAZING AND TRULY EXCITNG. i WOULD LOVE TO SEE THEM LIVE. A FRIND OF MINE HAS AND SAID IT WAS THE ONLY CONCERT HE WANTED TO DANCE AT , EXCEPT GRATEFUL DEAD."
5,Great Scanner Great Price,"The primary use is scanning high school yearbooks. After experimenting with scan options, I settled on the professional mode and several settings. I use 24 bit color at 300 dpi, Unsharp Mask Filter at Medium, Descreening Filter at General. This does a great job digitizing a yearbook. The BW settings are 8 bit grayscale, 300 dpi, same unsharp, Descreen at Fine prints. This eliminates any moire patterns. Scan times for both settings is approximately 1:35 which is completely acceptable. My only complaint is that I can't name the settings. It's Setting 1, Setting 2, etc... I highly recommend this scanner."
5,No more 9-5,"This book really helped me break into trading in a big way. Being that I was a novice at trading,Wade's ""Wall street money machine really open my eyes in knowing that I could learn a strategy and perfect that strategy. I have been able to paper trade using call and put option trading,and the rolling stock strategy. I tell you I have gotten back 25,30,300% on some of these option plays in 1,2,5 days I've gotten back a 38% return in 20 days on a rolling stock play. For the life of me I can't understand why all the critism of Wade Cook has come about. Some seem hurt that they lose money using these stategies; so have I when I didn't plan my exit. But that's the market. Get over it. I thank Mr.Cook for this book."
5,Catchy title... better playing,"Ghielmi and Pianca are a very good gamba/lute-duet. This is one album I keep coming back to and it never seems to get old. For example I find their interpretation of Marais' la Reveuse better than any other I've heard, including Savall's. The performers obviously had a lot of fun recording this and sometimes go out on a limb in their decisions but both players are technically very accomplished and can get away with pretty much anything. The gamba sounds fretless, though, and a few glissandos might annoy puritans.I highly recommend this album."
3,Excellent price and delivery of only so-so recording,I'm usually a fan of Ghielmi but this recoding is as named more Bagpipe sound than viola da gamba and for me - off the mark
2,hit-and-miss performance (commensurate with price?),"I did have to fight a bit with this battery - install, power on, power off, reinstall - because I was getting an ""Invalid Battery"" indicator on my Motorola V551. It did eventually work, but to this day I will sometimes get the same error message. Battery power fluctuates as well - sometimes good, sometimes dead in less than a day. But I think I paid $5 for it, so maybe I got what I paid for (not really - if it's advertised as a working product, it should work, no matter the price.)Really, it's more like 2 1/2 stars."
5,Actual Motorola Battery,"Great price on a great battery, arrived fully charged and lasted several days before having to recharge. Bought for an old Motorola V265 phone, Cell origin was actually China also finished in China."
5,Excellent book on boundaries and relationships!,"This to me is one of the best books ever written on boundaries and relationships. Talks of the structure of a person's boundaries, ways to know where your boundaries are, the necessity of having boundaries within your relationships. Written with sensitivity and love. Anything further that I could say about this book would fall short of its quality. I consider this a must read for anyone from any kind of dysfunctional background, especially those struggling with boundary issues."
3,Just okay,The author keeps referring to his other books. If you have not read these you may have trouble keeping up.
5,angelo rocks,yngwie steve joe angelo not musisions. you better bite your tounge nickki the stuff these guys do no one else can' can you play like that i think not. i think they are not faking it how' ive seen yngwie play live. and i dident see no delay box or any kind of gizmo to help their speed. angelo is a awsome giutarist not well known as the others but he's just as good buy his albums if you can find them
2,Nice product but expensive,I ordered this item being a left handed and looking for this exact product. It appears to be well made but my complaint is I find the title deceiving. This order is NOT for multiple spirals but rather just ONE. The picture and title showed it to be multiple rather than a single one.Good product just very disappointed at paying close to $8 for one spiral. Most likely will not order again.
2,Something easier,"I have a laptop and a desktop and needed one place to enter my household expenses. I now use my bank of america site along with moneypants.com I also like reading the articles and encouragement i get from the newsletter. i like budgeting over the web better than using ""my budget planner."""
1,very disappointed,I was very disappointed with this book. It was more games than toys. They offered very few instructions on how to make the few toys that were presented. The games were not ones to box and share but of ideas of activities to do. My goal was to keep the traditions going by making toys and games to share with others and this was not the book for me.
3,A Bit Disappointing,"I've read the entire series, and although Lucian has always been a central and interesting character in other books, his own story was rather weak. Lucian becomes involved with Leigh, a mortal, when a rogue hunting goes awry. The book was definitely more comedic than others in the series, but the romance between Lucian and Leigh was lacking. There was romance, yes, but it took almost the entire book for it to come to fruition. That was a bit disappointing. It was still a very fast and enjoyable read though, and I'd recommend it. There are several more characters that could potentially have their own stories, so I hope the series continues."
5,An incredible book!,"When I lost my severely premature son earlier this summer, I was frustrated trying to find a book for my four year old that would help him understand what had happened -- and then I found this book. It is gentle and simple and so utterly perfect, whether your baby died in utero or shortly after birth. It takes such a difficult topic and puts it in words (and beautiful illustrations) that children can understand. I hope you never need this book, but if you do, you'll be so glad to have it."
1,awful,"i know the other reviewers said it was too sad, but i thought, ""well this is a sad time"" ... it's okay to be sad ... and it is. But the book is just too sad for a 4 year old ... the first half is good ... but it ends with NO hope."
1,Poor writing-I returned it,"This book was too graphic. I thought there would be a little more reference to ""after life"" or ""faith and religion"". This book was very ""blunt"", but I guess it is supposed to come from a child's perspective. I bought this for my sister in-law who had a miscarriage. When my husband and I read it, we decided it was best not to give it to her. I do think there needs to be a book like what I was imagining, but this did not have what I was looking for,"
4,Independent Publishing Reviews-Very practical & fun guide,"(...)Very practical guide. Well-organized into helpful chapters on every travel subject imaginable. But not a dry read. Funny little travel predicaments and stories are interspersed throughout. Heavy on the cruise ship/group tours, style of travel; light on low budget treks.

Attractive cover with a definite lazy tropical appeal. (...)"
2,Poorly titled,"I purchased ""Restricted Films of WWII"" because it implied that the contents were never (or seldom) seen before. Actually, there's nothing ""restricted"" about the DVDs. The entire product is simply a series of news reels that millions of people have already seen, and, quite honestly, the news reels are quite bland. Don't bother purchasing this one."
1,This film is Restricted to BUY!!!!!,"Apart from the nice art work on the DVD cover, this film is a waste of money! The quality is quite bad, and truly nothing shown on these DVDS would merit the title RESTRICTED films of WWII! Save your money, do not buy this DVD set!"
3,The Scarecrow Walks at Midnight...,This was bought as a Christmas gift for my niece. I remember reading these as a kid and liking the fun creepiness that these books created. I believe my niece liked getting it.
4,Quite a good book.,"Jodie,staying with her grandad and granny,is in for a most shocking experience when she finds out that the scarecrows do a lot more than scare crows away........................................................."
3,"Interesting, but has its flaws.","All in all, a good read for someone interested in the river and solo canoeing. However, I would not agree that Harris writes ""great prose,"" but I know that is not the goal. Some of the descriptions were pretty cringe-worthy. ""the air is as pure as a kiss from a child at bedtime"" seemed to be reaching. Also, as someone who is an avid paddler and am contemplating making a similar trip - leaving for Minnesota and a solo river trip in October?!?! Seemed completely crazy not to simply wait a few months for spring. Would have saved him a lot of shivering"
2,Too small,"It was 510 pages at 4 inches x 5 1/4 inches, so a 6 x 9 book would have probably been only 200 pages. The references were confusing and I had a hard time finding some dream items, i.e. I dream of a beach and crashing waves. Oops! No beach listed but they do have sand. Wouldn't there be a difference as to what they meant?"
5,They don't make 'em like this anymore.,"The American Heritage Junior Library series of books is long defunct, but they live on through used booksellers. Initially published by American Heritage and later reprinted by Troll Associates, they are outstanding hardcover books that are well-written and quote heavily from primary source documents. The Story of Yankee Whaling is particularly good and, like all the books in the AMJL series, is abundantly illustrated with contemporary paintings, drawings, maps, and engravings. Can be read for pure please or for use by serious history students, junior high level or above. Don't let the ""junior"" in the series title fool you. These can be read and enjoyed by adults too."
2,Nothing much of interest in the characters or plotting,"I guess I've lost my taste for most chick lit. No surprises here -- too much time spent on brand names and boy friends, nothing much of interest in the characters or plotting to keep me interested. And the author employed one device I found really annoying. Rather than just let the story unfold, she'd jump ahead: ""Later that day I was really, really mad because of something that happened..."" And then jerk you back: ""This is what happened..."" Didn't work for me. In fact, it pissed me off."
4,Jimmy's still the man,"Jimmy McGriff has MS and is in pretty bad shape. So granted, he can't burn it up like he used to, but his playing on McGriff Avenue is still very soulful and from the heart. Sax Gordon, known mainly as an R&B player, turns in some great solos, and the horn section is held together by the mighty Ronnie Cuber on baritone sax [formerly with George Benson's organ combo]. This one is worth checking out."
1,Most Disappointing,"After the pure joy, of experiencing the absolute genius of The World of Monsters, I can only say that if The Drovers, don't go back to that style of creativeness,it will be a great loss.Len PayneSouth Africa."
2,It was good 19 years ago....,"China mending has changed since Echo Evetts wrote this fine book. There is still some useful information but not much. Porcelain repair products are much more varied and widely available today. Epoxies, lacquers, enamels and an airbrush are still the staple, but the names, brands and sources keep changing. Evetts however deserves credit for writing a book that gives more information than most, even though much is obsolete (not Evetts fault). Most repair books are either incomplete (they don't want to tell too much), or obsolete. Some of the recent literature is simply in error. Allan Koskela, restorer."
2,A repeat of the first two,"The Joy of Stress and Humor Your Stress are, each of them, quite delightful. How Serious is This is a duplicate and her energy is lagging at the beginning. I found that the last half was the most inviting to see. I have shown the first two above many times to groups of people and they have never laughed so hard as they did watching her."
2,Not up to date with latest info,"The authors may have some good suggestions about glycemic load but they are way off on some of their facts, such as a low carb diet can cause muscle loss. A University of Illinois study published in August 2005 issue of the Journal of Nutrition showed that the women who ate a low-carb, high-protein diet had more productive workouts by burning more fat and building more muscle mass than those who ate a low-protein, high-carb diet.I gave it two stars for the meal suggestions but don't give up your low-carb lifestyle. Use this book with caution and only to ""cheat"" intelligently."
2,NO BULBS,No bulbs were included with the fixture. All the fixtures at this price at Homedepot and Lowes included the bulbs.
3,A good little prayer book!,This is a nice little prayer book however I expected it to have more prayers and overall the book just feels incomplete. I have many other prayer books which include several other of the saints prayers that I was hoping to have included so that I may have only one prayer book to carry around. However the prayers that are listed are very nice and include the latin version of the prayer as well. If you are Catholic and ever attend Vespers and Benediction of the Most Blessed Sacrament you will notice some of these prayers. There are other prayer books out there much better than this but I DO NOT consider this a waste of money in the least bit!
2,90% filler and the filler material is dismal,"What a horrid recording. The only reason it gets one star is for Who Do You Love Now? and I Begin To Wonder. The rest of the disc sounds like a dance machine was set on repeat and poor melodys were thrown to try and make a dance recording.I'm really disappointed since Who Do You Love Now? is one of the best dance songs I've heard in a few years. The rest of the disc is not even in the same league, let alone the same planet."
2,Exactly the same as her sister,No difference. Are we sure she hasn't done all of Kylie's CDs?? Or Kylie didn't do this one? Creepy.
2,Do Not Be Fooled,"I read these online reviews form people telling me ""If you like Kylie you will love this"" and ""Dannii giving Kylie a run for her money"" . Give me a Break!!!!!! After reading these reviews I was expecting a great cd. I feel like I totally wasted my money. I honestly say I hardly like any songs on this cd. Nothing sounds like the single ""I Begin To Wonder"" except for ""Who Do You Love Now?"" which is not even her song, she is just the featured singer. All the other songs sound really cheezy like some old bad rejected Madonna. This cd is so behind in its time. It should have been released in 1982 or something. You have no idea how disappointed I was. Even the highlighted song ""Put The Needle On It"" stinks. Trust me if you like Kylie and are expecting something similar, do not go in this direction. 2 Stars for the 2 Good songs."
5,DANNII ROX MY SOX OFF!!!,"She is awesome and has a kick arse voice. My favorite song is ""Put The Needle on It"". Dannii looks very sexy in the music video. Even though the song is very sexual, I like it. I also like ""I Begin To Wonder"". I love this whole album actually. Go Dannii!!!"
4,Indochine Back in Form,"Firstly, let me clear a misconception. I believe the editorial review presents Indochine's latest album as the ""Hit album from 2002 by the most popular hard rock band"". Indochine is everything but a hard rock band.I was a fan of Indochine in the 1980's. I stopped following the band in 1991. At that time, Indochine was running out of inspiration. To tell you the truth, until very recently, I thought the band was dismembered. It is only when I read a glowing review of Paradize that I decided to give Indochine another chance.This is a brilliant album with great lyrics. For those who do not know Indochine, this band sounds like The Cure. Great album, excellent contributors. The old fans of Indochine will not be disappointed. Nicolas Sirkis and his bandmates were able to reinvent Indochine."
1,Rubbing your beard off isn't a good thing,This shaver doesn't shave close without a lot of pressure and now the battery won't hold a charge after 2 years of use.
1,Remington shaver screens,"Will never buy another Remington product unless it's a shotgun. Within two weeks of buying a MS5100 Remington electric shaver, the screen broke. I ordered a replacement set of Remington screens from Amazon, and within two days, it broke. Amazon=good Remington=bad"
4,Tension among the heirs keeps you guessing,"Josh Trevett left an unusual will--leaving his country house to his 2 nieces and nephew to share. Each gets his/her own wing and must live there for 3 months to inherit.The inheritors of the title have little in common, despite being from the same family. Jenny is the old maid schoolteacher, sick of her limited life and too shy to speak up. Hester is more concerned with a convenient place to escape from a social disappointment and sheltering her daughter from ""undesirables."" Nephew Tommy is in trouble with the law again, but to keep his daughter out of it, he sends her to the farm in his place.So who will stick it out to the end? Will they really be able to get along, stuck in that house together?I enjoyed this book. It is a bit old-fashioned, perhaps, in the restrictive social views of Hester, but the complicated family dynamics are very much what people face today."
3,Not a perfect fit,"I had to get the assistance of my friend who has a car repair shop, with his tools and lift we finally got this thing to fit. Buyer be ware! Once it was on it worked fine with no issues."
3,Arrow has almost got it !!!,"I think Arrow has almost got it with their T72 Staple Gun, It fires nicely but they still haven't found a way to get the staples to grip better, they claim they have put a coating on the staples that is supposed to make them hold, but what they really need is some kind of barb on the staple to hold it in !!!"
1,Junk,"When I fist bought one of these I thought it was a great product. It provided a quick, cheap and easy way to run RG-6 cable. The first one lasted about a year, then started to ""misfire"" by not fully ejecting the staple leaving it stuck half way out of the gun. This happened once in a while and became more frequent until it would not set any staples. I do satellite TV installation so just thought it was wore out. I purchased another but within a couple of boxes of staples it started doing the same thing. You would think for $50 it should not be too hard to make a reliable staple gun. If you plan to use it only lightly and do not plan on putting more than a couple of boxes through it then this should work fine. On the other hand you can buy the more expensive and better screw cable clips and save money."
1,Don't,"This device is a toy, and a poor one at that. The visibility is low, the instruction ""manual"" is ineffective, the stylus effectiveness primitive-to-nil and the sequencing of contents clumsy.'Nuff sed."
1,Anti-Semitic drivel,"This novel is absolutely abominable. The storyline and plot are crap, with no real excitement/twists and turns. The characters make ridiculous comments to each other e.g. ""I think there is going to be a civil war in Israel"". Anti-Semitic views and ideas are supported throughout the novel, which I'm sure will cause great offence to Jewish readers. As a Christian, I feel ashamed that a fellow Christian would write such bigoted drivel.This book is a real bore; the plot can be summed up in a pamphlet."
4,Basket Case 2 Fantastic Sequel,I have never seen Basket Case 2 until last night when I bought it yeserday Afternoon. And I have to say I was really amazed Not As Gory As the Original Basket Case and not as good. I love the seen where Belial jumps out of the Wicker Basket and jumps on the blonde reporter and turns her into a freak along with Belail and all his friends.Overall I would rate this a 4* out of 5*Now I Just Have to get my hands on Basket Case 3 which I have Never seenAlso Check out Brain Damage Classic Horror / Gory 5*P.S Frank Henenlotter Is A Horror God!!!!
4,"Great Compilation, but...","...it's still missing some songs, some of the tracks are single edits, and I don't like the non-chronological track listing. Here's what should have been:1. The One Thing2. Original Sin3. What You Need4. Listen Like Thieves5. This Time6. Need You Tonight7. Mediate8. Devil Inside9. New Sensation10. Never Tear Us Apart11. Mystify12. Suicide Blonde13. Disappear14. The Stairs15. By My Side16. Bitter Tears17. Taste It18. Not Enough Time19. Beautiful Girl20. Elegantly Wasted21. Don't Change"
3,One song on this album really stands out,"Yes, concerns go out to the tragic loss of the lead singer of this band. But, I beg you to listen to ""What You Need"". I am very angry at the people around this band for not giving them what they need. I see this song as one of the most upbeat songs ever made. When you hear this song, think of people like me, who CAN give you what you need! Crank up ""What You Need"", and always remember that there are those in 2012 who wear a big smile!"
1,Never Sounded Better,"Apart from the great selection of soundtracks, what really makes this compilation top value is the quality of the sound processing. Executed with finesse, these tracks sound better than when first issued and many are unedited, fuller versions: like ""Singing In The Rain"", for example. Throw in the great price, and this double disc set is a ""must have"" for all lovers of classic movie music."
5,A very especial book,This is one of the most beautiful stories I have read . It will touch your heart .
2,Not all that it's made out to be.,"I had a few friends who thought this book was sweet and recommended it. Honestly, I'm not crazy about this story and my oldest daughter whose six found it a bit boring. She loves any and all books, but this was not a hit. Yes, it is a book about self-sacrifice, but the kid in the story is a bit self centered if you ask me. We read it; its fine, but we won't be reading it again."
5,Glasslover,"this dvd records the four hand version of glass' recent opera L'enfants terrible played by davies and will soon be released as a CD. The dvd shows visuals during performance which are nice, but not necessary.for those interested in 4 hand piano music and philip glass this is a real treat. warning: the DVD does not play in car dvd players and the active side of the disc is not marked."
3,Al Dente Squid Ink Fettuccine,I bought the black pasta for Halloween. Everybody thought it was cool but really it is not very high quality pasta. I bought it because the price was good and I needed black pasta. In a pinch I would buy it again.
5,"A fantastic book for anyone, even if you work alone.","This book does exactly what it sets out to do. It explains what great customer service is and how to achieve it. It forces anyone in the service industry to examine their behavior. There's so much that you wouldn't necessarily think of while on the job, but makes perfect sense when you read this book. Most of it is also applicable to dealings with people in your personal life as well. Very useful and well written book."
2,over hyped,just over hyped songs sound the same again again and againgave 2 stars because theres two good songs.THE END.
2,Yawn.,"Good album title. I picked this up because of a buzz in the music press, and thought it was pretty monotonous. A good example of guitar rock caught in a creative rut. (Axton)"
4,Insightful Reading,"This is a well told insightful story of one woman's path with all of its human peaks and valleys. As Ms. Jenkins tells her story the reader becomes more aware of Buddhism and its beliefs. Her story is humorous, sad, inspiring and I found myself identifying with many of her struggles. Great reading and hard to put down. After reading this book I sent my copy to a friend. A good book is meant to be shared."
4,A Very Good Beginning...,"This pilot for the popular WB cartoon does what long-time fans of the Batman animated series hoped it would. It took the legend of Batman to the next level as well as to the future and created a new hero that builds on the old without lessening the old's impact. A strong script, anime-influenced art and good voice work propel the tale of the new Batman's arrival at breakneck speed. And Kevin Conroy is excellent as an old, somewhat surly Bruce Wayne.Too bad the series has not lived up to its promise since. Watch this and then try the rest of the series with some trepidation, and wait for this fall's ""Return of the Joker"" video."
1,Bummer!!!,"I only rented this movie because everywhere I looked, people where telling me that my fav. actress, Rachael Leigh Cook, was the voice of Chelsea. I don't know if this will help anyone out there but, she is not the voice of Chelsea. So if that's the only reason you want to watch it, you're not missing much. Not a great movie."
3,For the fans.,"I absolutely love the Timm/Dini cartoons; however, the new Batman Beyond series (but also the newer Batman and Superman episodes) suffer from flat characters and foreseeable and not quite original storytelling. Very, very good writers have seemingly left Warner animation, and even though Dini and Timm still deliver their best concepts and ideas, the result seems rushed and the animation is weak. No episode so far was better than average. Still, this DVD is the perfect gift for any Batman Beyond fan, since it includes some bonus episodes in perfect DVD quality, with excellent voice-acting as ever. ...!"
2,Not as good as the first,"Even though the episodes are much better, there were absolutely NO bonus features. Its as if who ever put this together said to heck with it, people are going to buy it regardless so lets just put it out.What made the first DVD so great were the bonus material. I expect even less from the third DVD."
3,Martin The second Season,I bought this item for my boyfriend along witht the rest of the season and he loved them!!! There was one disc that didn't play he only mentioned it once but he has been so busy watching the others he hadn't said anything else. But it did arrive in a timely manner!
5,Hilarious!!!,"I haven't watched anything in a long while that actually made me laugh so hard my belly ached. I mean from one episode to the next I'm left in stitches. Although all good things must come to an end, I preserved this good thing by purchasing the DVD and I'm certainly glad I did!"
5,It Gets Better With Time,"The more I watch this show, the better it gets. Pure classic! Even after all this time, it still cracks me up. Especially funny is the episode where Martin and the gang went to Hollywood."
2,What a Disappointment,"I've read four children's versions of the Iliad, and this one is by far the most disappointing. The author has chosen to concentrate on the romantic aspects of the war, which is certainly an option, but to end it with Menelaus in tears is going way too far. My students, familiar with the story from other sources, found the dialogue trite and laughable. As one said, ""Since when would Achilles say 'Sir' to Agamemnon?"" There are far better versions of the Trojan War out there to use to introduce children to this classic. This one's a miss."
1,What a Bunch of Academic Twaddle!,"I'm probably numb to the nuances of Cultural Criticism, but the essays in this book are the worst sort of claptrap from grimly earnest strivers in the groves of academe.Trying to evaluate the cultural significance of The Simpsons is a fool's game--it's there in plain sight every night in reruns--but these authors are undeterred. They are bound and determined to override a work of collaborative genius with their own stale biases and canned interpretations.And not a one of them shows a sense of humor, so far as I could discover. The writers and illustrators of The Simpsons are miles ahead of these writers in evaluating contemporary culture.Maggie would not countenance their hogwash."
3,"Nice book, but I prefer the previous edition","I already had the 1995 edition and was very curious to this 2006 update since a lot has happened at CF Martin.The front cover states 'new pictures and revised text' and that is true. But they also changed the format, layout and paper quality. And so it has lost all the magic of the 1995 version. That one had very nice fold out pictures, was very easy to read because of font types and color, and had those body size sketches and charts and style charts.If you haven't seen the 1995 edition you will probably like the 2005 edition. But for me the 2005 edition has become a book as many others already available."
4,Good Robot,I bought this for my sons birthday party and was fairly simple to put together. Product worked well and has lasted. Would recommend to others. Also purchased Toysmith 4M Tin Can Robot and Robot Duck.
3,Liner Notes,"""This musical tribute to ancient Egypt was originally composed in 1978 for the King Tutankhamun Exhibit at the Seatle Art Museum. It was inspired by the artistry of the ancient treasures and the religious symbolism of the Egyptian Book of the Dead which suggested the titles of the compositions ... The recording is unique in that it is the creation of an accomplished Arab artist who captures the essence of Near Eastern sound and presents it in a contemporary innovative musical idiom ... Only traditional Near Eastern instruments were used in making this recording ... The music incorporates Near Eastern elements such as melodic ornamentation and drone accompaniment. Yet it possesses a distinctly abstract and ethereal quality enhanced by an emphasis on non-metric, free-flowing rhythm and pentatonicism ..."""
1,Not UltraViolet!,"This is a black light bulb - literally. It's NOT an ultraviolet light as you would expect from the name, it's a dark colored light bulb. Be forewarned, you're probably not going to get what you're expecting."
3,Cheap price and cheap product.,"This spinning tie rack works well, i bought 2 of them. The first one i put together broke while i was putting it together but the second one works well. I saved the one that broke with some gorilla glue but it cant spin like the other one. I would say buy it, but be careful with it."
2,Tie organizer,It is to small to hold regular sized ties without being bunched up. I would not recommend it for ties; it might be used to hang belts or something else.
3,A properly priced product,"For the price, it is a simple unit. It is a plastic hanger that can hold several ties. It is not meant to be stylish, merely functional, and it does just that. It is a good deal for the price that you pay."
3,Perfect for my ties,Perfect fit to hold my ties. Perfect fit for the budget. Perfect timing arriving to my door to be put to use.
5,Great Product - Great Service,A super product at a very low price that totally solves the problem of HOW to ORGANIZE a closet full of ties!
1,same one i found today at the dollar store,"I had to stop at the dollar store today to get a few things and right by the check out I found this. Same exact name and item, for ONE DOLLAR ($1). Complete rip off if you would just drive to the store you can get the same one for way cheaper. It's a good tie holder for a dollar and also if you would like to leave your house, Target has $5 ones every year during Christmas time, just depends on whether or not you will actually leave the couch."
4,Quality item for the price,"It feels very cheaply made... but you get what you pay for in qualities I suppose. The item itself is very simple, easy, and displays the ties very nicely and makes them easy to get to. Its one of those ""why didnt I think of that first?"" products. Its basically the top half of a 10 cent plastic clothes hanger and a piece of circular plastic of the same material that is grooved for your ties. If you're looking for elogance, you might want to look somewhere else as this thing doesnt ooze ""fancy"". But its very practical, and a good price"
5,Great!,"I purchased this for my husband's ties to get our closet more organized. It doesn't take up hardly any space, and helps to make our closet more neat. It holds about 20 ties. Great price too!"
1,"Don't buy this rack, go for another one","I had very high expectations for this rack, since I have a lot of ties and didn't have any proper storage for them, sadly, I had to go into the market looking for another, as this one couldn't do the job.Short story: this rack can't stand the weight for which it was designed.Long story: This rack is made of two pieces that snap together, a design flaw that probably was made with the purpose of allowing the rack to spin and maybe to make its packaging easier, however, the fact that it has two pieces, with nothing to hold it together but the very same plastic form the hook that snaps into the carrousel, as a result of all this, when you put one tie in each of the hangers, as intended, after one or two minutes the carrousel loosens from the hook, and falls to the ground along with all the ties."
5,Awesome Tie Rack,"Don't know how I got by without this. I wear a tie for work sometimes and this is the easiest way I know to store ties without wrinkles, and without taking up a lot of space."
2,You get what you pay for.,"The product came as described, in a new box so nothing to complain there. Know though that the plastic that it's made out of is incredibly cheap...hence the low price. The hook of mine snapped off as soon as I put any pressure on it which was a bit disappointing considering I waited a few weeks for it to arrive (within the estimated time frame though). Overall, if you just need something really cheap and are careful with how you put the two pieces together, you should be fine."
1,cheap,This was cheaply made. It broke when my wife was assembling the rack. Tried to tape it together but did not work.
4,Great Value.,"For such a low price, one can't complain too much if there is any minor problem. But a problem is a problem, regardless.Now, maybe I was just overly expectant, but this tie rack will come loose if there is too much weight on any given side. Meaning, if it's not nearly evenly distributed weight all around, it'll come loose from the tight grip it has upon first use. Considering the light weight of ties (cloth/silk), I wouldn't expect it to give in so easily. However, it is just a hanger.Still great. Saves space compared to many other tie racks and stays put for the most part."
5,Twirl-A-Tie Organizer,"I like this product very much. Easy to hang ties, easy to see the ties you have, and easy to hang in the closet without taking up very much room. No need to remove the rack from the hanger to see what you have as all that needs to be done is spin the rack around. If you're like me and wear a tie every day, this a really a simple and convenient thing to have. I ordered 2, and it was just enough for all my ties. Good price for the items, but shipping is expensive. Buy this with another item to get the free shipping on the whole order. Don't get the fancy or motorized one; for this the simplier the better."
4,Erica Jong Has Written a Gem of a Book!,"While this book is not for everyone, it does contain explicit sex scenes, it is a novel full of high adventure, love lost, love found and often a very amusing novel that many would enjoy!"
5,a creature of rare beauty,"I find this to be the release I've been waiting for from Sylvian. Beautiful melodies that play again and again in my head to the point where one considers that this could actually be the most commercial release from David since the days of Japan.Plus of course we have the amazing Steve Jansen working with him on this (also ex-Japan) - it doesn't get much better - a genuis of rhythm and sound design. Then there's the exploration of Sylvian/Jansen co-writing material along with the third member of Nine Horse... Germany's Burnt Friedman - a collusion I would never have guessed but is truly inspired, as is the input from Stina Nordenstam. Buy it or miss out on something really special."
4,Emotional.,"this is what music is all about, the emotion in a simple legato trumpet note, or the raspy, delicious vibrato of vocalist David Sylvian; it makes me melt and feel so good and pure. think if Tweaker were to make jazz--and really chill out--this is what it would sound like. you'll never hear a sweeter sounding clarinet, ever. there is everything one could want. possibly the perfect record. it's jazzy and cinematic and the double bass throughout is enough to make anyone melt and feel the emotion of the music course through their soul.absolutely brilliant and definitely essential. one of my favorites from the year."
5,Great for Letter Recognition!,"We put the Uppercase letters on the fridge when my kid was just over 2. He loved playing with all of the letters--especially M for Mommy, D for Daddy, etc. When we started watching Leap and the Letter Factory (a DVD), he would run to the fridge to get a letter and put it into the unit. At 2 1/2, he could identify all of his capital letters! Lowercase are next. We added the lower case (I think I had to get them from BN). They have a chart in the package which we posted on the fridge . . . he knew the lower case within 2 days. People can't believe that a 3 year old knows his letters and numbers. thank you, Leap Frog!"
4,"A good, specific angle on the topic","Good book. As one reader noted above, it seems aimed at providing background information rather than how-to guidance. And this is a good thing. It's definitely worth reading if you're interested in broadening your understanding of COM+ architecture and its underpinnings."
2,Low price because of low quality,"I am new golfer and don't know what kind of clubs I should use. So I bought this complete set in Amazon. Lowest price I can find. The clubs looks good when it came. But I have already broken 7 and 8 iron in driving range practice. They broke at the same position of club head. So I think the material of the club head doesn't qualify the club head requirement.Bottom line is, it's really cheap. The bag is OK. The putter won't be broken. For the rest, at least I got a trial on all the clubs.My conclusion is this set of the clubs can be a candidate for first club set to get some experience on golf club but not qualified to play golf."
4,Have some classic songs all Buffett fans must have,"Mile High in Denver, Ace, original version of Captain and the Kid, some great songs that complete the Jimmy Buffett collection of any true Parothead. Interesting to hear the early style of a singer still writing tunes and making albums 40 years later."
4,Quite Good,"Overall, a good book.For a while now I have observed and participated in completely futile apologetic exercises, and I think that this book should assist not so much in answering the highly techical questions that some have, but more so in focusing on the importance of my attitude and the attitude and underlying psychology of the person being witnessed to.In a word ""Person Centered"" apologetics and identification of the *real* issues rather than smokescreens.Content is good. If I had to critize, it would be that the layout of the book is a bit haphazard and it tends to jump around a little, fortunately in a more 'macroscopic' fashion, so it doesn't obscure the message too much..."
3,Great shape to this bag but questionable quality,"Former amateur and golden gloves, I've worked with quite a few bags and I really do like the size of the everlast classic here but I can't really say that this bag in particular has lived up to it's name. I've owned it for 2 years and went through 2 bladders (no big deal though that happens) but what I'm concerned with is a sizable tear in the leather. A quality construction bag should not be tearing so soon and I have only used it on a genuine speed bag platform at my boxing gym (2"" thick!!). So, just thought I'd share. I could of gotten a defect though as these bags are well respected in the boxing community.Peace.-Alexander"
5,Friends Forever,"Great story and pictures in this book. The cats are pretty cool cats and are friends with mice and dogs too. It shows that everyone is different but it is okay to be different, that they can all still be friends. I liked that they give an index of the Spanish words that are going to be used in the story, so you can learn them or refer back to them. It is a great way to start introducing other languages to children, or to have a text children can show they know and understand, besides English. This story also shows how good friends think about each other, deeper than just being there to play all the time. The illustrations are very catchy and fun. They have Spanish written throughout the pictures. This is a great story to read to children and for older children to read."
2,Poorly written - okay story,"I like Scott Simon on NPR and I really wanted to like this book, but I was disappointed. Character development is poor and I was unable to picture the scenes that Simon was writing about. Descriptions are not clear. There is a lot of dialogue but I didn't find it particularly interesting or engaging. I do enjoy listening to the author a lot on the radio."
3,repetitive and slow moving,The book is hard to read as nothing changes very much. The middle of the book is still reading the same as the beginning.
3,A Lot of Music...,"This soundtrack has multiple versions of the 10 songs in the film. The first are done by the characters' voices and then Burl Ives does a repeat of all the songs as well. It's not a bad thing; just a whole lot of music. Fun, lively soundtrack that reminds me of the movie and makes me feel cheery. I recommend the CD; just be prepared for a lot of repetition and a lot of Burl Ives!"
1,Is Toni Morrison for Real?,"The reviewer below who said ""More Heat Than Light"" got it partly right. This book is SO badly written you have to wonder if the author's other works were written by the same person. Not only is it sophomoric, it is gibberish. Had its author been unknown, she would surely have had to pay for the book's publication. Incredibly bad, it may at least serve as a source of hope for struggling writers who believe that only the best works are accepted by publishers."
4,Down home and friendly,"Leander Stillwell's account of his time in the Union army during the Civil War is written in plain, soldier's words. It's a delight to read. Don't expect analyses of battles here. This is in-the-dirt, day to day living in the trenches and on the march."
1,"Oh, serve the re-hash","Anyone really interested in the Windsor's should skip this book. It is a total re-hashing of known events previously published. The events of his governorship were covered, but not in much detail. A great deal of the book was devoted to the history of the circumstances surrounding their births, courtship and abdication. The only new portion of the book was a small up-date on the island as it is now,to include new building projects, demolitions, and current usage of houses etc. No photos were included."
4,Enjoyable,"It's an enjoyable read, with a lot of historical information about Charleston, Savannah, and Ireland in the years following the U.S. Civil War. Happy I bought it."
4,Great read,You know what writing any sequel is hard but to write a sqeuel to a book you didn't write in the first place is even more difficult. I have a first edition of Scarlet and I have read it and reread it many times. I love it. I think it really allowed Scarlet to blossom and grow up. To become who she wanted to be. She could not have done that in the south. She was strong and appreciated for her strength. I would highly recommend this book. As a matter of fact I think I will go read it again!
3,This Book doesn't keep the same ideas as Gone With the Wind,"I really hated this sequel. I hated it because: The characters were not the ""same"" characters as in Gone With the Wind. She tried to make Scarlett a ""modern woman"", raising her own kid...come on now! That was REALLY frowned upon way back then. I hated the sex in it....there was no sex in the original, why is there in this one. I am sure scarrlett would not had this ""not-being-married and having sex"" because she married ashley's cousin and THEN had sex (so we are brought to believe)... I thought of this as an average 90's book, full of smutt and ickyness that rules society today...books dont necessarily need to have any sex in it to be good!!!!!! An AVERAGE 90's book,,,"
3,"Good book, but doesn't live up to the original","I fell in love with Gone With The Wind and was very excited to hear that a sequel had been written. I just had to know if Scarlett got Rhett back, so I read it. I have to give Ripley credit for trying, but she didn't have to bring the trashy romance-novel-of-today atmosphere. For the most part, she sort of sounded like Mitchell, until the ""love scene"" on the beach; that part made me ill, litterally. And I also didn't like how she took away all of Scarlett's morals--she practically slept with everyone! Even though all I've done is complain, there are good aspects of this book, too. I would reccomend it to anyone who loves GWTW, but you will be disappointed more than once."
4,A great attempt,"This sequeal was a great attempt at recapturing the magic of GWTW. It starts the day of Melanie's funeral and follows Scarlett to Rhett's hometown Charleston in an attempt to win him back. Alexandra Ripley incorporates characters from her previous novel Charleston almost effortlessly and brings a new facet to Scarlett. She also goes to Savannah and Ireland to meet her O'hara kin. My only regret that it harps too much on Scarlett's adventures with the English and doesn't expand too much on the ending which I will not reveal. And to al those naysayers who claim they will never touch a gone with the wind sequeal.... if you don't read the book, don't post a review, it's simple as that."
4,THE CHARACTERS OF GONE WITH THE WIND TWOGETHER AGAIN,"I FOUND THIS TO BE ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I'VEREAD. THE CHARACTERS ARE ABOUT AS CLOSE AS MS.RIPLEY WILL GET TO THE REAL THING. ALTHOUGH I DO THINK THAT IF THE AUTHOR HAD USED MORE OF HER OWN IDEAS IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A BETTER BOOK.BUT MAY I REMIND YOU THAT THE ORIGINAL AUTHORWAS A SUPURB WRITER AND NOTHING WILL COME CLOSETO GWTW, SO GIVE MS. RIPLEY A BREAK."
2,not recommended! (spoilers),"the first couple chapters good, middle is just a waste of my time cause i actually read it hoping and praying that it would get better, it doesn't,, i was soo bored, but i refused to stop reading cause i had to know, i just had to know, well i'm saving you the trouble that i went through, After being missing for about 80% of the book he finally returns in the last chaper and they get back together.this book left me with questions also, but this time i just did not want to know...i was so disapointed as were most people who read this book too long to boring. I liked the descriptions of the olden irish days in Ireland."
1,Makes Me Sick!,"When I read Gone With The Wind, I just couldn't put it down. It was so beautifully written, and I love books like that. I used the page number to my advantage, for I loved every single page that I read... But this! This makes me SICK! I could write better than this. It's written in what I call *1ST GRADE WRITING* yuck! I don't think this is even worth reading. It's such immature writing. Scarlett isn't the selfish complicated woman that Gone With The Wind described, in Ripley's book, she's a heartsick wuss who needs Rhett's love and can't live without it. She suddenly turned kind (am I missing something here? Spoiled Scarlett O'Hara? Kind! Ha!) And early in the book, Rhett takes her dressed as the queen of hearts into his arms and laughs, when his mind is supposed to be set. A. Ripley is mistreating the characters in this, writing simple words, not writing with the passionate love that Mitchell wrote with..."
5,A review that does Scarlett justice!,"Like most people I had just finished Gone With the Wind, and found out there was another book, a sequal, so i snatched it up, and devoured it. I started a little skeptical at first but it was magnificent, it filled up all the sadness left from the first book, and at some points it got a little slow, i just wanted to keep reading. It held true to Rhett's and Scarlett's attitudes before, and I just loved it, I just finished the 800+ page book today in like a week and a half, and am soo happy, and can't wait to see the movie! Enjoy!"
1,"Frankly, my dears, I didn't give a damn!","This was a horrid sequel; trite and uneven plot throughout.I cared nothing of the characters, nor their actions as I plodded through this tome. Surely it MUST get better. Shame on me wasting my time on this. IT did not get better. No moonlight. No magnolias. No hint of a viable story. Why did this book ever come to fruition? I assume it ws merely a commercial venture.I am at a loss of words to even describe how this would/could/should be a ,""sequel to Gone With the Wind.""Margaret Mitchell would be turning over in her grave."
1,not really worth reading...,"As a huge GWTW fan, I was very excited to read a sequel. Sadly, this one wasn't quite worth reading. Ripley's long-winded, unimaginative writing brings shame to the Scarlett and Rhett saga. Scarlett would have never chased after Rhett. She's much more a believer in the best revenge being living well. Rhett is vastly more intelligent and clever than Ripley can apparently imagine. She fails to capture any of the original character's personalities and turns them into disappointing hollow shells of themselves. I'd suggest skipping this one altogether, or reading it with shots of brandy."
1,Sophomoric is too good,"A poor effort that constantly reminded me of the books read as a middle school educator. It's not nice to fool with Mother Nature, or a classic. Only no good can and did come from this endeavor. Where the inane ideas for dialogue, settings, and happenings came from is surely a mystery. Margaret Mitchell would be appalled."
2,soap opera,"That was a sequel written just for the sake of making the disappointed readers happy. I could read it only because it was a sequel ""Gone With the Wind"". That novel lacks the spirit of its predecessor. Scarlett no more cares about material things, she goes through a transformation, Rhett marries a regular woman. The conclusion was terrible. The novel's beauty was partially due to its open-ended conclusion. ""Scarlett"" overlooks that fact.It is a commercial book. If you've just read GWTW and enjoyed it, better not read this one"
1,"The book is pretentious, long-winded, and a waste of time.","This book is an embarrassment to Margret Mitchell. Alexandra Ripley is a tacky, un-original, and cliched writer. If I wanted to read about magic and overly dramatized romance, I'd be in the fantasy section. The book was a waste of time, and I would have been better off had I not known of its existence. It has one star because that's the fewest I can give. Read Gone With the Wind. It's real writing."
2,Ripley - believe it or not...,"must never have read the book for which she wrote the sequel.Awful.The only reason I gave it 2 stars is that, if this hadn't been about the fabulous Scarlett, I might - emphasis on the ""might"" - have been able to read it more dispassionately.Because it was, however, the long-awaited sequel I had great expectations going in. Ms. Ripley, it seems, had no such ambitions. This is just a common place romance that misses the entire emotional and psychological makeup of the title character as originally created by Mitchell.I can't understand why the Mitchell Trust ever approved it. They must have just needed some money."
1,Save Your Time and Money,"I am embarrassed to admit that I actually finished this book, painful as it was. Two things stick out about this book: first, most of the book and dialogue is simply a re-write of GWTW; second, the parts that are original are the most ludicrous, simple-minded drivel that I have ever read. How can you screw up a book when you're writing from a classic original? Well, it's been done. Scarlett returning to Ireland and going from a drunken lush to ""The O'Hara"" a respected member of her clan? How about the almost instantaneous metamorphasis of Scarlett from shallow and selfish to caring, loving and intellectual? Or Rhett from the masculine character to the love-struck wimp? Or the birth of the changling baby? Is there always a witch in these dime-store romance novels? Don't bother with this one, it's a total waste of time."
1,Corrupting the original to call this a sequel,"Completely unsatisfying -- none of the depth and complexity of Mitchell's GWTW. Characterizations are shallow and very inconsistent with the original work, and crucial scenes are just skipped over with a brief mention after the fact -- as though the author wasn't confident in her ability to write them. Worst of all, the ending is a joke: characters aren't supposed to KNOW they're larger-than-life -- it nullifies any sense of humanity they may have been given (which in this case wasn't much). If this story was meant to stand alone, I'd simply be rolling my eyes at it (like the dime-store trash novels it resembles -- you know, the ones with Fabio on the cover?), but as a so-called sequel to ""Gone with the Wind"", it's appalling and downright contemptible. It's tragic that the iconic excellence of ""Gone with the Wind"" has been corrupted by this pandering mess."
2,This book made me sad...,"I was highly wary of this book to begin with--and with good reason. The book is....ridiculous, to say the least. Ripley took the MOST far-fetched idea possible and ran with it, and that would be to have Scarlett go to Ireland. Ireland!! What's worse, is that when in Ireland, the villagers practically do a dance around her because they love her so much. Ugggh! No one loves Scarlett that much.The ending was probably the worst part of the entire book, though. It is nonsensical and improbable. That said, if you manage to detach the idea that this is THE Scarlett O'Hara from THE Gone With the Wind, the book isn't an entirely bad read. When I remembered that I was reading about the ""same"" Scarlett, I got pretty upset, because she's just not the same at ALL, and Rhett's not even there most of the time. He's only there when it's convenient.I guess I'd recommend reading it if you've never read GWTW or seen the movie. It's better that way. Much less painful."
2,"Well, God's nightgown!","Read the book in 2 days on my sick-bed after a wisdom tooth extraction. Hurried through all the boring parts of the book, which was plenty.In my opinion, there was not enough of Rhett Butler. And too much about Ireland. *yawn*The ending was totally rushed and came up on you so quickly and the next thing you think to yourself was ""That's it?""There was only two good points in the book, which was the beginning w/ the whole Mammy situation. And then in the middle after the boating accident. The rest is just blah blah blah......Saw the movie before the book too, a long while back.....the movie wasn't even close to resembling the storyline of the book. So the book is at least slightly better, but just not enough of Rhett Butler! hehe"
4,Wonderful!,"I love how Alexandra Ripley picked up exactly where Margaret Mitchell left off. I think she did a wonderful job in transforming Scarlett from a spoiled southern belle to a sophisticated, caring individual. She made Scarlett examine her life and put it into the proper perspective. I felt her emotions as if they were mine. Taking her back to her roots in Ireland was wonderful, I loved reading the vivid descriptions of the countryside. But my favorite chapter was the last when Rhett and Scarlett both realized that they were meant to be together. This was the second time I read GWTW and Scarlett and I would highly recommend both of them. (Although, I would not recommend the movie.) I wish someone would take up where Alexandra left off and take us into Cat's life as a young woman."
3,Wolf in Sheep's Clothing,"The beggining of this book was well done, and really followed the ending of Mitchelle's book very closely. But as the book dragged on,(most of the story moved very slowly)Ripley began to rewrite the characters. By the end of the book Scarlett and Rhett only had the same names as the original characters. The book was disguised to look like the sequel to Margret Mitchelle's classic ""Gone With the Wind"", but in the end fell quite short of carrying on the legacy of the greatest book ever written."
1,Shame to call it a sequel,"Maybe I didn't like this book because it wasn't GWTW, but maybe I just didn't like it. Like probably everyone who has ever read GWTW, I dreamed about how things would turn out between Scarlett and Rhett. But this book makes a joke out of anyone's imagination. Ripley has all but sabotaged the original characters. Scarlett has been transformed into a simpering ""little"" woman, as opposed to the strong-headed heroine she was in GWTW. Rhett is no longer a rogue, but just some average, boring, southern gentleman. Not sticking to any characteristics of the Mitchell's original creations, this book is bound to disappoint you."
3,"Better than expected, but....","The story was good, the writing was fine - but I have serious reservations about the quality overall, especially considering this as a sequel to Mitchell herself.I read Ripley's Charleston years ago and she lost me pretty quickly as a fan when she referred to the two girls in pre-war Charleston as going on ""double dates""...."
2,Scarlett,"This novel is too ""wordy"". It needed some more editing. General story line is interesting but the plot is buried in rambling thoughts."
1,Not Recommended,"I would not recommend this book to anyone who had a love for ""Gone With the Wind"". ""Scarlett"" was a disgrace to the characters and to Margaret Mitchell. In this book, Scarlett was not the same person she had been in GWTW, she has been changed to a weak, cry-baby woman and it was a disappointment to see her lose her strong, courageous aptitude. ""Scarlett"" does not do justice to GWTW and I would not recommend this book to anyone."
4,Ripley never claimed to be Mitchell,"So I've been reading through these reviews, and while I understand that the sequel is quite different from GWTW, what did you all expect? Mitchell is dead, and there will never be a truly ""authentic"" sequel made. It's more valuable to discuss Ripley's book on the basis of it's own merit. Scarlett in GWTW is childish, ignorant and selfish, but that is what we all love. However, I love how Ripley takes Scarlett and makes her a whole character in this novel. You see that there is more to her than an all-consuming selfishness, as she finds a family that she loves and cares about, and finally breaks out of Ellen's shadow. I thought Ripley did a magnificent job keeping true to Rhett's character, and also keeping true to Scarlett's, while still adding more dimensions to both characters. Overall, I love this book. Although GWTW is still my favorite, I love Scarlett and will continue to read this book over and over again."
1,THANKS FOR SPARING ME.,I am grateful to all those who sent in a review for this book. I've just read GWTW for the um-teenth time and again filled with the need for closure. But thanks to so many who care to spare me the agony of reading the 'sequel' I shall rely on my own ending. Thanks again.
2,"GREAT DISC, BUT BUY THE REMASTER","I purchased this CD upon its release in 2003, then, annoyingly, aremasterwas announced in 2005. Even though I was not happy about it, I picked up the remaster and was totally amazed that the sound could be THAT much better.I will leave the content comments to the other posts here. However, if you're considering buying this fabulous disc, make sure you get the better-sounding version."
1,"Lame, not even kitschy fun","I love the cheesy horror film genre, but this didn't even produce on that count.It wasn't silly fun it was just painful to watch. It was like some friends got together for the weekend and decided to make it into a film, but they don't even come across as the type of people you'd want to hang out with. The thing just dragged, the story, such as it was, just started and stopped. There was gratuitous sex, which ended up coming across as gross and unecessary. There was absolutely nothing memorable or enjoyable about the flick."
3,"not that impressed, but not disappointed","when i first got it, my first impression was ""gee, that's really PURPLE"". it was partially my fault because i really didn't know malva means purple. on the picture, it looked black. another thing i didn't like about it was that the long single handle is not removable. so it kinda awkwardly sits between the 2 short handles. a third thing i didn't like about it was that because of the shape of the bag, when you pick it up, it bunches in a weird way. it doesn't stay square like the picture shows. now what i do like about the bag was the price. also the capacity is big enough for my long prada wallet as well as my cell phone, my clunky keys and makeups and even a hairbrush. but it's not too big that it looks like i'm hauling around a backpack. and eventually i got used to the purple. it's actually kinda cool that every other prada you see are black, so mine's special. overall, i was satisfied with it."
4,Always a surprise,"We listen to alot of blues, jazz and alternative music. Every time I pull this CD out, my husband wonders who the artists are and what this CD is. That tells me that you've got some great and unusual tracks on here. Well worth investing in. Hope some of the money goes back to NPR. Cindy"
2,They taste okay...too chewy,"These gummy centipedes tastes good, except for the red and white. I'm really concerned at how much it taste like soap. It really taste like soap. They're a little more chewy than i expected, even after reading the reviews posted. On a scale of 1 to 10, soft to chewy, theyre an 8. Almost as tough as beef jerky."
2,"Great concept, mediocre execution","Maybe I've been spoiled by Beaux-Arts renderings, but I felt real disappointment when I saw the art work. If you're an opera buff and only casually interested in the architecture, then maybe it's not as noticeable. Photographic plates would have been much better for me."
4,ANOTHER MOZART MASTERPIECE OF FUN & FOLLY...,"With the wonderful voices of such outstanding performers that we are so fortunate to be able to enjoy, this ear pleasing music is enhanced with the visual treats of the DVD... It's like owning your own opera house without having to leave your armchair..."
4,Great book so far!!!....still reading it though,I bought this book for the soul purpose to learn what it takes to make films and what not. I'm an aspiring actor and I just started in films last May 2007 and up to Dec. 2007 I've done 11 films as an extra or an actor with speaking lines. I'm also reading Screenwriting for Dummies which is also very helpful. Someday I'll take this knowledge from these two books and more to come and make a film.This book is easy reading and enjoyable. So far I have no negative comments about it.
5,best mix,Procul harum live bridges classic rock with classical music. In this album you'll hear a gutiar played as an instrument of the ochestra. Absoulutely a brilliant piece of music.
5,2ND BEST WRESTLEMANIA EVER,"THIS WAS THE 2ND BEST WRESTLEMANIA EVER, OF COURSE WRESTLEMANIA 2001 WAS THE BEST! THE LADDER MATCH IN THIS VIDEO WAS GREAT!"
2,Villages a cover for pornography,"Updike is a great writer so why does he have to resort to all this salacios sex? My background has many similarities to Owen's but for the many escapades outside of marriage. Maybe I'm jealous of his exploits, but I just think it's sad that Updike has to resort to the many pornographic desciptions of the sex act to fill out the 321 pages of a novel. Is he fantasizing or actually reliving his real life experiences? My wife gave this book to me as a Christmas gift... do I think she's giving me hints on how to improve our sex life? I don't think she read beyond the descripition on the flyleaf. I'm really debating whether to recommend it for her reading. It's a shame really because we both enjoyed all the Rabbit books. Updike you let me downdike!!"
2,Sexpots and computers - somehow I don't think so.,"Although the writing is decent and there are morsels of wit here and there overall this Updike novel is quite average. As an IT professional, I found the references to the IT world, ostensibly the professional setting of this novel, less than convincing if not completely unbelievable. The sexual exploits of the filandering protagonist and behavior of the whorish women in the novel even less so. Mr. Updike's mysoginist fantasies are so removed from reality that they reach the point of comedy."
2,Cheap Tricks,"Okay, Updike is a master, and I've enjoyed many of his books through the years. In ""Villages"" a bored suburban husband turns to a life of petty adultery in all it's various forms. As the main character Owen studs his way through the married women in his wife's circle, each provides insight into his character, sagely extolling his virtues; he is such a little boy, so innocent, sweet, so... Eeh gads, Updike, what were you thinking? I was hoping for a bit more depth, more exploration of the complexities of marriage, middle age and beyond. Is sex, frequent phallic worship and a return to fetal-like maternal comforts all a man thinks about? That seems the central message of this book. Poor Phyllis, the only really interesting character is conveniently bumped off at the end giving our ""hero"" a get out of jail free card. A tidy and unexpected soap opera ending."
3,Outlaw history,"Interesting book. If one is really into the stories behind the outlaws of the American West this book covers a lot. I was bored at times. The author did his homework though, kuddos to that."
2,Not The Best,I find this to be just a expensive cover not that much to be expected. Had to order separate seal for the portion behind the window. Buy any solid type for better sealant from the weather and for security.
4,What a great movie!,"This could be the beginning of a new series. The killer could be the next Jason or Freddy! A posessed wood doll who kills people...it's new. But then, it's the same company which made Jack Frost. The movie is funny and has a average gore. It's also a low budget move, you can see that. It kind of reminds me of the first Friday 13th, maybe because Betsy Palmer plays the characther of Grandma. I would highly recommend this movie for everyone who like slasher films."
4,I love this....,...film. I like it because it is better than all these lame horror movies. THIS IS WAY BETTER THAN THE FIRST ONE. The best part is when betsy palmer (Friday the 13th) appears.***spoilers ahead***And let's not foreget Peg's near death scene is very tear-jerking.***end spoiler***I like morty. Do you?
2,DO NOT BE FOOLED BY THE CUTE COVER,"This book is depressing and boring. It centers on the relationship between J.D. and the children, and the romance takes a back seat. Also, the great angst that the hero is hiding turns out to be stupid."
2,Not What I Expected!,This book was recommended to our book club and I must say that it was a let down.I had to force myself to finish reading it.
1,Sleeping Pill,"This book was a pain to read. Honestly I could not even finish it. If you cannot sllep at night, instead of popping a sleeping pill, I would suggest you pick up a copy of the ""Sweethearts of Soul"". It is guaranteed to put you to sleep. I would not recommend buying this book, or even checking it out at the library. the author's writing syle makes this book a pain to read!"
4,Like a trip through the Sahara,"Great music! Very authentic and engaging. However, if you're looking for some washed-out version of North African music for western ears, with lots of studio effects and electronica / dance bases, this might not be for you."
2,"Excllent movie, but audio was terrible -- constant background static noise.","The movie won awards for a reason. It is exceptional. Whatever company recorded it to BluRay, however, did a horrible job with the soundtrack. During the entire movie, it sounded as though there was rain falling in the background. It was distracting at the least and very much disappointing. I really like the movie, but the BleRay was awful."
2,Would pass on the next,This book just didn't do it for me. I did not care about the characters or the plot.
3,Glass shades not all the same size,Love the lights but was frustrated that the shades are not a consistent size. Some are longer and wider than others.
2,"They try, but sound uninspired -- they've done much better","These guys were talented. They made a lot of great songs, but there's only 2 on this album that qualify. They would be: ""Heaven Sent"" the only thing in this set that really rocks, and the best track ""Not Enough Time."" ""Not Enough Time"" is a sexy, catchy cut that captures a true feeling of passionate romance. Particularly good is the piano. The keyboard player in this band is responsible for laying down the bedrock of more than a few INXS hits.Sadly, most of the rest of this album is unremarkable and often bad. Even the cover art is weak and the CD case is annoying (hard to open). At least ""Questions,"" the opener, attempts something different with its Middle Eastern flavor. It kind of peters out and the band must've agreed because they abruptly cut it off with ""Heaven Sent."" ""Men and Women"" attempts something different as well by utilizing an orchestra, but the results aren't much of a turn-on."
3,Did not overly impress me,"There is a reason there are only 17 reviews (counting mine). It just isn't that good, at least to me. This is more Beatles to ELO type pop. Any reference to Pink Floyd or Jethro Tull is wildly misplaced. The production quality and musicianship is fine, just not something I will likely ever listen to again."
2,A Bit Deceptive,"Quite a few of the stories in this don't fit the mold of Pulp Fiction and some of the stories selected are just down-right terrible.Granted, the whole pulp fiction genre is not known for its literary achievments in greatness, but I expected to see the best in the genre. Instead, it is a very mixed bag. The Harlan Ellison tale is the only I'd consider fantastic, otherwise there are maybe 5 or 6 worthy stories."
5,Review of Shades of Grace by Barbara Delinsky,"I loved this book. I found it easy to read and it gave me an incite into my own memory problems. I often find books that show life as it really is, very interesting and helpful in giving me a new look and better understanding at what's happening in my own life. Well written and very entertaining. Extremely hard to put down once I started reading it. I highly recommend it."
3,"Some good stories, some not-so-good stories.","There are some excellent stories in this anthology, notably ""An Object Lesson"" by Mercedes Lackey, in which she once again brings back the character Tayksa the ex-assassin, a character she has written several stories about in previous anthologies. (This was an excellent story, even if it WAS merely a set-up for an abysmally clever pun.) But there were also some stories that I didn't think much of, particularly ""The Gift From Ardais"", by Barbara Denz, which started out well, was well-written, and ended in a needlessly depressing way, serving no point that I could discern. Less bad, but still not much to my liking, was ""To Serve Kihar"", by Judith Sampson, which seemed to me to have an implausibly upbeat ending, not justified by the story to that point. Now, I'd rather see unjustified optimism than unjustified cynicism, but it still isn't really a good story if I don't feel the ending is justified by the story leading up to it."
3,Not as small as I thought,"I have a Totes umbrella that is about thew size of a cigar and I thought this would be a nice gift for a lady friend to carry in her pocket. This one was bigger. Still a nice umbrella, but rather large to fit in a purse. I guess you want a mini-mini-totes"
3,a little dissampointed,"I was really looking forward to receiving that book, because walking bass lines are such an essential part of jazz guitar comping and reviews for this book were promising.. so i expected more of this book. it really only involves some basic concepts, such as chromatic approach to roots and some very basic introduction to using chord tones and modes and substitutions. the material could fit in 1-2 pages, no need for a whole book.I was actually expecting some real lines... and some more advanced/interesting/varied voicings. that book really doesn't go that far if you want to play some cool walking bass.. in my opinion, that is.But still, that book will get you started and it is a real good book just for that."
2,Very Disappointing,"I have read Weber books before- most notably Primary Target, which was very realistic and actually pre-dated the methods of a lot of the terrorist threats in a post-9/11 world.This book is a disappointment with an improbable plot, paper-thin characters and a surprising lack of action. Thrillers can get away with the first fault and still be good reads, but lacking in the other two is pretty inexcusable. The main characters spend most of the book discussing how bad China is, talk about China's rise to power at the strangest times in situations, and their conversations sound like a political science paper each time.The action really only starts at the end and manages to miss any opportunity to redeem itself, for example a sea-air battle over Taiwan that sometimes just consists of listing the ship names that were sunk.If you want to read books about war with China, read Dale Brown's Sky Masters or Fatal Terrain, do not read this book."
5,Two words-Mussetta Vander!,"Before Cowboys And Aliens, before Firefly, there was Oblivion and Oblivion 2: Backlash! Cleaver mix of western and sci-fi with some VERY recognizable faces and high camp but the real scene stealer is Mussetta Vander as the girlfriend of the villain in Oblivion and title character of the second to quote Lash ""Delicious!"""
5,Re-issue in begining of september...,"good news for oblivion fans on full moon direct they are re-issueing this movie for only fourteen ninent nine,so forget the high price sellers and check it out on their site."
2,Poor Quality,These braclets are poor quality. Several were very dim. Several broke and leaked all over my hands. Choose a better brand!
1,NOT so brite glow sticks,"I bought these 8 inch glow sticks because the other supplier/manufacturer of these ( different brand ) was sold out. This variety is a low grade and low quality glow stick that eventhough is cheaper and non-toxic; the sticks only glow for a couple hrs and not a full day like US Glow brand. These are flimsy plastic ; only half full of the glowing substance, and the connectors don't align as well vs. US Glow. I will NEVER buy this brand again. Incidentially this was advertized as a multi 10 color assortment and out of 300 sticks there are still just 5 colors : pink, purple, yellow, green and blue. So it's misleading. ( There is no red, orange, dark pink or light blue or dark purple ) Save your money as these are made in China and are NOT so brite glow sticks."
1,"Not as described, low quality, barely work","This product is not as described, showed up in plain coardboard box (NOT TUBES), and were very low quality. The are thin, and break occasionally, and the connecters are cheap. The only color that worked was the green, ALL other colors (so ~250 of them) were practically non existant even in the dark. I will never buy this brand or from this seller again. Junk junk junk, waste of my money, and cheapened my experience. I've ordered from a different seller, and a different brand before, and they were GREAT. Stick with a good brand, and not this seller. (US Glow labs, is what I purchased last time)."
5,A Cogent Argument,"In this book, Andrew Vaughn offers that a proper place to test the historicity of the Chronicler is in comparing 2 Chronicles 29-32 with the extra-canonical archaeological and epigraphic data. Vaughn makes conclusions such as material found in Chronicles yet not found in Kings is consistent with the said data.The debate concerning the relationship between the Hebrew Bible and history is widespread these days. No matter which side one is on, I think Vaughn offers a compelling argument. Key to his argument is the dating of the LMLK jars. However this latter analysis alone makes Vaughn a worthwhile read."
3,Biased!,"Well researched as it is (hence three stars), the book disappoints due to the author's open aversion to Boyington. The fact that the CO of the Black Sheep occasionally drank too much, apparently did not affect his flying skills, which were well above average, nor did it endanger his men in any way. Still, to Mr Gamble Boyington's alcoholism is the subject he enjoys most and a source of his numerous derisive remarks. More than that. Because as a PoW of the Japanese, Boyington was smart enough to get himself a job in the kitchen, where he was able to steal some food, the author of the book nearly labelled him as a traitor. Mr Gable, I can only wish you had gone through a WWII Japanese PoW camp yourself."
5,A hero we can believe in,Who doesn't know about Pappy Boyington? Or did we just think we knew? Mr. Gamble gives us the real man beneath the cardboard hero. I understand he's now working on a full-bore biography. Bravo! Can't wait to read it. -- Paddy O
4,Best of GGW I've Seen,"First off if you are looking for hardcore porn, this isn't it.I got this on BR as my first experience with GGW DVDs. It's hot! Okay, it's frustrating to get just brief glimpses of the girls actually fingering themselves, but the girls are hot.After buying this one I have bought a few more. This is the best I've seen.Buy it for what it is and you will enjoy it. Video quality is great so what you see is very clear. Had this been less a tease and more show the action it would have received a 5 star.Still I recommend this one for those who don't need hardcore to enjoy."
2,"Like GGW? Try ""WILD GIRLS THAILAND""!","So I gotta say I love GGW, but I have found out where the GORGEOUS ASIAN GIRLS are at! These 2 frat boys have put together a great reality show of babes, bikinis, and beaches in Thailand! You get the chicks and the tour of Thailand! This is what I call a real spring break-Check it out! Rumor has it, their next video has been shot in Croatia."
4,great book,"I really enjoyed this book that I had to read for a morals class. Each chapter discussed a different issue (abortion, marriage, war, etc.) and it included all sides of the debates including the history, court decisions, and philosophical viewpoints. The chapters had a perfect amount of information and were a perfect length."
4,school books,"good price i dont want to write 18 more words, this is why I normally dont review. This is ridiculous"
4,Good pitch back - but parts missing,"This is a very good product, but there were not enough of the bungee cords with it. It has held up very well, so far, and my grandson (7) enjoys it almost every day. It has helped him improve his throwing, and catching skills. I would recomend this, but make sure of all the parts!!!"
3,You get what you pay for!,"I purchased this for my 11 year old son, he is a pitcher. It was a great value, compared to other pitching nets that I have looked at. I am not impressed with the construction, the 2 plastic pieces that allow you to adjust the height broke within the first week that he used it. It now has to be used at the lowest setting. I wish I would have spent a little more and gotten a better quality net. He is now using it as a golf ball return!"
2,Not likely to elicit the desired response,"At least Leving finally abandoned the openly misogynistic ""fathers' rights"" movement and he offers some sound advice as far as it goes, but those going through an acrimonious divorce are far more likely to apply it to their estranged spouses than to recognize it in their own behavior. Besides, anyone who would read a self-help book in the midst of a divorce is just the sort of sanctimonious prig you'd love to sue the hell out of."
5,Perfect blending of fact and fiction,"Mr. Dobbs is expert in developing a believable story while being historically accurate to the career of Winston Churchill.Dobbs brings Winston alive once again while the reader learns a great deal about Britain, and leadership, in those dark days immediately following Winston's ascension to prime minister.The description of the tragedy that unfolded at Dunkirk is outstanding and Churchill's response to it in and how he rallied a nation from the depths of despair to absolute resolve to survive is very well told. Another great read from Mr Dobbs."
5,I'm A King Bee by Slim Harpo,"If you could only buy one blues album this would be it for me. This is ""Old School"" blues like I used to listen to on radio in the early 50's and who the Stones stole all their licks from. This is roots from the deep south. Get a copy today before they forget who this great bluesman is."
4,Great new artists,I love the song 'undo' and the rest of the album is just as great. I am sometimes amazed at how much the new up and coming artists have such a wealth of songwriting talent. This group is going to be around a long time.
3,Dancing at the Blue Iguana,"Even though the movie had great star power and they did quite well in their parts, the movie, was somewhat hard to follow. The plots were so intertwined that to follow took a road map which was not provided."
1,This blows!,"This has to be one of the worst films I've ever had to witness. Slow and very boring. For its subject matter the film is very un-sexy and has many many flaws. The main one being the truely dire acting courtesy of Daryll 'Splash' Hannah and Jennifer 'Bride of Chucky' Tilly who's character is obnoxious and annoying. I could not possibly reccomend this film it ... big time and you will be very disappointed if you rent this one out, never mind buying it!"
3,Gift for a Friend,I bought this for a friend and she enjoyed the movie. I watched it with her and wasn't too impressed. It's an okay movie.
4,several brilliant performances,"The overall movie may or may not be profound, great or even especially noteworthy. But several performances, especially Sandra Oh's portrayal of a stripper-wanna-be-poet was touching, profound and heartfelt. Not to be overlooked is Daryl Hannah's role - desperately seeking to cheat her way into motherhood.It's worth a watch, even a buy.Those wishing to see a true stripper gets naked movie should simply rent Showgirls (again). This one is sexual but certainly not porn."
3,Much smaller than it looks!,"So, it was my fault for not reading the description correctly (even though the picture is misleading) but I purchased this for standard sized cupcakes. When I received it, I realized my mistake but ended up keeping it because you never know when you might need it.When I did finally decide to use it, I was really unpleasantly surprised at the actual size of the unit and how mini anything would have to be to fit on this. Really, nothing bigger than a donut hole would work on this, and even those might be too big. I was going to use it for mini eclairs and they were still too big. I ended up putting this in a yard sale as it was useless to me."
4,Nice but small.,"I did not notice that the stand was for mini-cupcakes, so did not expect it to be so small. Nonetheless, it was well constructed and we are keeping it."
4,Not as Bad as all the Other Reviewers Say,"I got mine in 2 days with everything listed in the description. It bolted on fairly easily. The receiver has a stop in it that won't accept some of my other accessories, like bike rack and 1 1/4 to 2 inch adapter. I can fix that though."
1,"Did not ship with riser, cover, and pin as indicated!!!!","Product Features* Drawbar, pin and clip are included (NO, NO, AND NO) THESE PARTS WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE SHIPMENT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!* Rated for 2,000 pounds GTW Gross Trailer Weight and 200 pounds tongue weight* Backed by a lifetime warranty* Resistant against black rust* Includes mounting hardware and easy to read installation instructions"
2,best feature -front cover,"very disappointing publication-suggest you save your money and check it out of the library before making a decision-the front cover was deceptive in its allure to those looking for a creative nudge in decorating tuscany style. but the most chilling part of this book,for me, was a revealing paragraph at the top of page 106 'quote' Given that the farmers probably will not be returning.I begin to plot new purposes for the hundreds of borghi in the italian hills: music camps,artists' colonies,hospices, religious retreat centers. After all,easily taking the past into the future is part or the italian genius for living.'unquote'... well, there goes he neighborhood! i'm just thankful i got to see Tuscany before the Mayes' makeover of the whole region --some people just can't leave rustic charm alone!!...norma"
5,Favorite Perfume Ever!,I've worn Bijan for about 20 years now and just love it. I have trouble wearing a lot of fragrances as they give me a headache but appreciate Amazon carrying Bijan and at such a reasonable price. My items are always shipped so quickly. Love Bijan and Amazon!!
2,I'm a bit skeptical,"I've been using it for a few days now, and my hair feels brittle after each application. I ordered argan oil from another supplier (free trade) to try to see if there was a difference. HUGE DIFFERENCES. This one smells a bit like licorice; I can't really nail the smell... It also has a adverse effect on my hair. The argan oil that I ordered from the certifiable supplier has a nutty scent and makes my hair VERY soft.I'm not sure what to make of all this..."
1,Smell makes it unusable,"This was very expensive and smells nasty, i bought it to use in my hair (as is one of the suggested uses) and the stench is unbearable, what a waste of money."
3,It's changed,"I've been buying this brand of Argan oil for 5 years - and always was so pleased with this natural product - an organic argan oil.Now company slightly changed the packaging and added the pump to the bottle , which is a great idea , but somehow the smell of argan oil changed - now it's smell more like a sunflower oil. I don't think I will buy it again ..."
4,accident,"I had two surgeries following an accident and I am using this on the multiple scars. I have always used Vit. E in the past, but these are much larger more pronounced scars. This is working faster than Vit. E."
2,Not Satisfied,everything went smooth. However Seasons 1 through 3 have all either been cracked or just not working. I am very disappointed. I am sending this product back
5,Best show ever!,"I love this show- I have watched the series from start to finish 3 times! They are my most watched DVDs and a great purchase! Don't forget to watch the outtakes and cast interviews! As a hetero woman, I have to say that this show is not just for gay men but for anyone who loves great character development and lots of hot naked men!"
3,"Low budget action, with nothing new to offer","This is a by the numbers low budget action flick that I'd recommend mostly for fans of the stars, which includes Desmond Harrington of ""Wrong Turn"" and ""Dexter"" fame. A group of people is stranded in a junk yard when their bus crashes and they have to ward off crazy bikers (who look like something out of a Mad Max movie). There's more blood than I expected and some surprises as to who gets killed, but overall its one of those 90-minute time wasters that serves its purpose on a Saturday afternoon."
3,Average,"This is the first digital picture frame I bought. The quality is ok... the pictures seem very pixilated. The actual picture size is also closer to 3.5 to 4 inches. For the price you pay, I'm sure you can find a better deal."
5,For adults and children alike,This is a beautiful book and appropriate for children and for those who are young at heart. The illustrations and the poetry are lovely. This is a book that I enjoy sharing with my granddaughters before we go into the garden to watch for the wee fairies.
4,I'm hooked on Jane Savoie!!,The only thing I didn't like about the tape was that it was too short....I wanted more positive words and ideas. I am a BIG fan of Jane's now...She come's with me (in my mind) to all my shows and you can tell!!! I highly recommend this tape and the book!
3,it could be better,i am a fan of Jesika but this album is not what i expected ...i really wished this album would have been more hyped up like jesik-come with me but it's still an enjoyable album and you will enjoy it's classic mellow cool classy beats n electric avenue like beats...enjoy!!
2,For Specialists Only,"So this is the PhD dissertation she started planning in junior year. She said she'd write a dissertation in an esoteric but easy subject and use her PhD to work in administration. Staff, not faculty. And it worked: Leslie is the one person I can think of who grew up to be just what she said she would.But she was right: her dissertation is indeed so minor that no one not directly concerned would ever notice it and so mind-numbingly dull nobody would ever read it twice.She could do much better. I hope she published fiction under a pen name -- heaven knows she had enough material for two novels before her 17th birthday."
5,The Blackmetal Album of the year,"World Funeral put Marduk over the top, as one of the top Blackmetal bands in the world. The songs range from Fast to slow and Legions vocals are brilliantly done. This is their best work since Nightwing,World Funeral eclipses that album.If you like fast, Blackmetal, get this today."
5,"Look Out COF Fans, Here Comes TRUE Black Metal","World Funeral is extreme, bitter, cold, raw, grim and all the qualities that black metal should be. The fact that this record is fairly new and sounds so authentic and true is awesome. Cradle of Filth are considered the ""evil"" and new true black metal band, I THINK NOT!!! Marduk makes those guys look like Def Leppard or somthing. Buy World Funeral now!!!"
5,A very good book on options trading,"WSMM#4 picks up where WSMM#2-Stock Market Miracles leaves off and where no other book dares to go. This is Wade's best book on option trading previously called ""Safety First Investing.""I recommend that you read WSMM#2 first, then this one. Another book that is excellent is the Complete Option Player by Trester.Options are very powerful tools when used correctly. Wade shows how.Godd luck with your trading!"
4,Lucy,This costume was great. It runs small so you should buy a larger size. All in all it was a great costume.
2,Lansky ain't no Bryson,"Just finished Last Trout with no regrets, other than having bought it . It was mildly amusing producing six smiles and one chuckle. If you see it at a used book sale pick it up. Otherwise let it lie."
1,"Well, at least his dad didn't publish this one","Apparently, someone thinks Mr. Lansky has talent. Someone, that is, besides his dad, who published ""Up the Amazon...""Like his other efforts, this book is not very good. No matter how entertaining the stories could be, bad writing is still bad writing.Keep trying, Lansky, maybe someday."
2,just a narrative,"very poorly done, still photos from books only with narrative. I was extremely disappointed."
1,If you want to believe . . .,". . . then of course this sort of thing will make sense. This book requires one to buy into the idea that there is an inherent (presumably genetic) style of thinking that Africans and people of African ancestry are pre-programmed to employ. In _Yurugu_ this purported style of thinking is appraised in glowing terms, as one would expect. But consider this: if, say, a Chinese author wrote about how black people are more soulful and don't let ""artificial"" constructs like reasoning and logic get in their way, would that be offensive? If so, then why is it not offensive for ""Marimba Ani"" [sic] to write the same thing?"
1,Pure Racism,"From the racist charicature of a white person on the cover, to the concluding summary, this is one of the great racist works of all time, rivaled only by Mein Kampf and The Isis Papers. For any anti-white racist, this is a must read. For any person of conscience, it is abhorrent."
1,These are like Fruit Gems? I think NOT!!,"These arrived today. Based on another review, I had expected them to be similar to Sunkist Fruit Gems. Any similarity, for me, was dashed as soon as I opened the bag - the candy smells like room deodorizer. I still had hopes, though, until I tried to eat one. The outside of the candy is as tough as shoe leather, and the inside is almost liquid. I tried one of each ""flavor"" - they all taste the same, and that tast lingers - on and on and on. Oh - and there is no nutritional information on the package - I thought that was pretty much standard now, if not a requirement. The price is good, especially if you do Subscribe and Save, and that is why I gave this product the one star. Personally, I would prefer to pay more and get something I like."
4,MNreview,"Good taste, texture (not sticky gummy). Was very fresh on delivery!! Recommended. Little bit too much sugar coating, but ok."
4,Childhood Favorite,"I grew up eating these in Germany, and until I bought it on Amazon, have only eaten it once in the past 14 years. I was so excited to find it online, as I remember it being so good, but I was a little disappointed that it was sweeter than I remember. Also, the inconsistent textures within the bag didn't bother me, but part of the bag had soft (fresh?) gummies and part had hard (old?) gummies. Lemon is better than the common candy-lemon flavor, but orange tases like orange soda, but grapefruit is really the best."
2,Outdated,"There was a time when this series had more meaning, but frankly, it's outdated. Dr. Dobson has some good material, but he needs to re-do the series and not refer to statistics from the 1970's!!! (Good Lord, we are dealing with children born in the 21st century now!) The information is so outdated, that there is no mention of AIDS when he talks about venereal diseases, and he makes reference to names no one calls their kid anymore, like Suzy and Marvin. His voice sounds hokey, and he takes way too long to tell his stories. Today's kids needs to hear things in shorter sound bites, and need you to get to your point quickly.Don't get me wrong--- I wish I had heard a lot of this material when I was growing up. It may have prevented me from making some of the mistakes I did. But my poor son was in pain trying to get through this series. We finally wound it up early. I decided in a year or two, we may try Passport to Purity. I did some searching and found out that alot people recommend that one."
