2,Too Small!,"I got this pencil case for my daughter for school. Unfortunatly it's only 7"" long, so I had to really grind down all her pencils to make them fit! It was certainly durable and pretty, but not practical as a pencil case. It would probably be better as a cosmetics case or something else."
4,Didn't want UGLY COOKIES to end,"I picked up this book because I liked the title. Little did I know that I would read the book in one sitting. I loved this book and the characters and their trials and tribulations. Even though they were quirky, they seemed real to me. I could identify with Bridget and her relationship with Carson. The authors didn't gloss over the differences between men and women. Also, it's rare to find a book that deals with senior citizens in such a compassionate way. I will recommend this book to people of all ages. At last, something I can share with my boyfriend and my mother."
4,This Book Has What I Look For Most in a Novel,"This book is a combination of what I look for most in a novel: It's a laugh-out-loud riot, but the characters have real soul and face plenty of real-life obstacles as they attract and repel each other in a very believable way. Plus, being from Philly, I really appreciated how the book conveyed the city's spirit."
3,"Sweet, but Overly Sentimental","This little book (generously type-set to make 167 pages) is set for the most part on the Hebridean island of ""Erinsay"" (not to be confused with the real island of Eriskay). Its hero is Jamie Stuart, a greedy, selfish yuppie at the outset of the book, who travels to Erinsay, miraculously goes back in time, and has a complete change of heart when he falls in love with a woman in the past. The protagonist's transformation is not believable, and the reader has too hard a time forgiving him for his earlier despicable behavior. Ultimately, when he commits his final selfless act, the reader is left feeling grateful but, unfortunately, not really saddened. Also, as a lover of the Hebrides myself (the reason I read the book in the first place) I was disappointed by how the author belittles the people who live there by characterizing them as quaint, superstitious souls--a stereotype that is sadly lacking in truth."
5,Another visit to Mitford!!,"The third in the series, this one will have you rolling on the floor with laughter, and reaching for a Kleenix with tears. And running to buy the fourth one to find out what happens next!!"
2,"These High, Green Hills (The Mitford Years, Book 3)",The book was old and stained pages! Looked like it came from the Library!The book was old and stained pages! Looked like it came from the Library!
2,Enjoy Visiting Mitford BUT Need Character Development,"I have read this third book - in hopes that the series gets better, in hopes that Tim & Cynthia have a ""laugh-out-loud"" entertaining wedding. Obviously disappointed that I did not get to ""attend"" the wedding - more disappointed in J. Karon because she just gave us Father Tim's view of not wanting to discuss it with Cynthia. Cynthia is such a good character - she should be developed to make Father Tim look less self-rightous. Father Tim does not deserve to be the Main Character, nor does he deserve Cynthia.Please develop the interesting characters - Cynthia, Puny, Billy and the group at the Main Street Grill. They are the only reason I will read Book 4 (by borrowing-not worth spending money)."
4,Hip hop,"This is a tight cd player, but the only thing that is missing is the heavy bass sound. If you listen to rap music you want that heavy bass but I still recommend this cd player to anybody, its one of the best cd players that I own. If you want cd player that got a heavy bass go copp the Sony DSJ15 Portable CD Walkman."
5,Best undergraduate ODE book,Goes every the mathematical details for the development of solution methods. Includes numerical methods as well. Many applications provided. Far superior to standard undergraduate texts in differential equations.
1,Complete rip off. Don't wast five dollars,Alarm! Alarm! Alarm! This is a one page review of Kaplin and Lee not an article about the law and administrative decision making as advertised. I'm really pissed. Save your money and don't waste your time reading this.
2,"Good camera, broke after 3 uses","Maybe I received a bad apple, I enjoyed it the few times I used it, but the second time off the docking station the image is just a color show... I dont know if I should stick with this one"
4,Mistakes,Inspite of the heading I can see no reference to Leonard Bernstein on this release. It is Kurt Masur's disc.
2,Seldom has 74 pages seemed so long....,"I purchased this book(let) expecting to learn of common ""pitfalls."" Instead, I believe I was subjected to a rant by the author on how genealogists create the pedigree that they wish they had by ignoring obvious disconnects in their research. I wouldn't consider this a pitfall. I consider this fraud. Great detail was provided for case after case of suspect researchers. (Of the 74 pages, many were devoted to citations.) There were some bits of worthwhile information wedged in between the tales of horror. I found the information on the calendar change and heraldry of interest. Otherwise, Mr. Rubincam's message was clear. Don't trust any source by itself. Always verify and reverify. I agree completely with this point. I just don't think it in itself justifies a book - even one as short as this one."
2,"Eh, no.","I adore ancient Egypt. Even more, I adore authors who can write about this place and make it alive.Lucile Morrison didn't do this for me. The characters all act foolishly; I couldn't develop any liking toward any of them. The way the story itself is written doesn't do anything for me, either. I often lost track of what was happening, and didn't understand that so-and-so had done such-and-such until maybe a chapter later.The only reason I can give that makes this an alright book is the obvious care Lucile Morrison took in researching it. Every word seems loaded with information on this time period. It just didn't come alive for me. Perhaps the fact that it is jam-packed with info makes it less real.The Lost Queen of Egypt is a quick, enjoyable read, but it doesn't have that quality of making me wish it would go on and on. It starts, it finishes, and I'm glad it's done."
5,About Tutankhamon's Queen,"It has been years since I read this book, too, but I love it! You have always heard about King Tut, but this one is about his wife, Ankhsenpaaten. A thrilling novel that lets you see into the life of the Egyptians. This is the type of story that makes you believe your really there, that you are her, living your life in ancient Egypt. Morrison does such a wonderful job describing the places, that you can actually ""feel"" the heat of the desert, until you walk into the cool stone tomb that is being painted and decorated, even though Pharaoh is not dead yet. It's amazing to think that I learned so much of the culture, scenery, and people, without even realizing it! I will always love this book, and will continue to read it every so often just to read a wonderful novel! Oh, and to the person who reviewed before me: Yes, I believe this is the same book you remember. I hope you find a copy for yourself, to treasure forever!"
2,Cold Blooded,"Usually, MJ practically sweats blood in giving his fans a new project. This seems like a song written in about 10 minutes with about as much effort as it takes to heat up dinner in the microwave. Still, being the MJ fan that I am I never the less find myself dancing around to it sometimes. But make no mistake this song is WAY below MJ's usual high standards."
1,Not Pleased,"I bought these ear phones after reading previous reviews. My use consists of listening to Ipod while on machines at the gym and riding my bicycle (off road). These are so uncomfortable I cannot use them. They sound so bad I don't want to use them. However, because the package is open, I cannot return them.Comfort: They appear to be an earbud type of headphone, but with a cover which directs sound into your ear canal. The cover is 'shrink-wrapped' to the earphone, and a small portion of the outside edge of the cover rubs against my ear (VERY irritating). The earphones are also too large to fit into my ear comfortably.Sound: Bad. I'm comparing to my Ipod OEM and other sony earbuds. I'd rate these a ""1"" on a scale of one to ten, and the apple earbuds a 5 or 6. These sound so bad they are not even worth critiquing. If you like the sound of your old 1 speaker am radio alarm clock, the sound should be fine for you."
1,Hurt my ears!,I tried these on for 5 minutes and my ears hurt!! The shape hurts! I tried at another time and it was worse. Returned.
2,Beware the value...,"While, a decent price, it quickly become evident upon use, the headphones are not of the greatest caliber. The sound is not the best. And with my ears, the buds do not stay in my ear very well. The cord is a bit short and stiff. I was not happy with the Sony design in this instance. Typically I like their designs."
2,"Good sound, but HURT","These earbuds have a great sound, but hurt my ear big time. The part that goes into your ear is hard plastic, and unless you were the model for the mold on these things... they're not going to fit your particular ear shape. There's only one size/shape, so your chances of a good, comfortable fit are slim. I ended up returning them and buying earbuds that have a soft rubber end that comes in 3 sizes."
2,Great sound with Side Effects,"I wore these headphones for awhile. They were great, but lately everytime I wear them, my ears turn red. I must have an allergical reaction to this so called ""anti bacterial"" earpiece. Pass if you're sensitive."
2,Killed my ears,I thought these would be good b/c they are anti-bacterial and I am a bit of a germ freak but they KILL your ears! The sound isn't bad but everyone around you can hear it too.
5,A must have for the price/ sound,"In the past two weeks I have ordered many different types an sizes of earbuds(I figured my ears must be a different SIZE than everyone else's)since most of the ones I ordered didn't feel good on/in my ear. I didn't want to spend a fortune on Earbuds that I would probably lose or sit on and crush. Since I use them with my mp3 player(iriver) and mainly for walking, price was a major concideration. The Sony MDR-EC21LP earbuds I have found to be great in the two areas that I have mentioned ""price/confort"" I would recommend them very highly to people with different size ears like mine."
2,poor sound balance,"I was very disappointed in these, Their sound was relatively murky, very much biased toward mid and bass, to a degree that couldn't be corrected with an equalizer. Though I could make out treble sounds okay and high-frequency sounds did come through, the audio did not feel crisp or high-definition. Similar to other in-the-ear headphones I've tried recently (e.g., Nexxtech backband 331-3000).That said, they were comfortable enough. If you mainly want big bass without lots of definition, these might be okay for you."
3,"Pretty good, but not great","I'm really pleased with the sound but, despite the description that says they block outside noise, I have to crank the sound way up (higher than I prefer) in order to hear the music while I'm on the subway. My old spark-plug type earphones sealed out other noise really well, but the sound it delivered was not as good as this pair. I find them more comfortable than the iPod earphones, but just barely. If you don't have to worry about outside noise interfering with your listening, these are pretty good."
4,Fontopia are the Fonz of Earbuds,"Very happy with the sound of these compared to about 5 different sets of headphones/earbuds. The difference in sound reproduction between these and the others is analagous to the difference between listening to a CD player versus an FM broadcast. They are also much more efficient, which means more volume at lower signal output. That translates to longer battery life. I'm only giving 4 starts because Amazon says the in-line volume control is a key feature, but it does not exist. I guess the earpieces are anti-bacterial. If so, they are getting a workout with all the ear wax that is slimed all over them (but that is probably too much information)."
4,Decent In-Ear Headphones,These are pretty good earphones. They fit comfortably and sound good. I am using them as a secondary set of earphones for my iPod and they fulfill that job nicely.
4,Good Value Headphones,"These are great value headphones if you're looking for something good to take camping or trips you wouldn't want to take really good headphones. They're comfortable, stay in the ear pretty well, and sound quality is about twice that of stock iPod headphones."
2,did not hold up,they look good but did not hold up to the work load i needed them for went dull very fast even with lube
3,Condition in Question,"Expected book to be used, condition was good except that many sections were bracketed by previous owner. Did not see information in the original posting."
2,Tiresome,I was about to come here and review this book and say that P.Craig Russell is one of the most overrated artists in comics. Then I looked at the other books that Russell has adapted and illustrated and there's been a rough beauty and a fascinating artistry throughout these works. That makes this particular book even more disappointing. I find the artwork in this thing to be rough and unrealistic. The faces are pinched up and uninspired and I don't like the way the bodies cannot seem to confirm to anatomy. Everything in this book is just ugly and uninspiring.And to make matters worse the pacing is slow and the storyline is really boring. I don't know how the original went but I am going to feel insulted on behalf of Howard until I read the original.There are some great Conan adaptations. There are some great P. Craig Russell comics (ironically Michael MOorcock adaptations are pretty cool) but this is neither.
5,Fabulously Moving!,"I recently heard a review of a Chantacleer CD on NPR and decided then and there that I had to have some of their music. I love the unaccompanied voices! And this CD is absolutely heavensent! The rich, pure vocals will give you goosebumps. I'm not much for ""church music outside of church"", but I'm so glad I bought this CD. Don't pass this one up!"
3,Good for supplementing a Professional Class,"I agree with the other posters who say you should go to a professional trainer, at least for basic instruction (tried to do Calanetics from books and never quite got some of the moves, though learning Pilates is helping me understand some of them). I go to a pro and found this book to be a good one to add to my classes.I looked at a lot of other books to decide which one to get. This one follows what my instructor is teaching which makes it easier to work at home. The pictures show better posture than some other books I've seen and the descriptions are a little better than average.Given the choice, I will pick a ""For Dummies"" book over an ""Idiot's Guide"" just about every time. In this case, the ""Idiot's Guide"" was the more appropriate one, to my surprise."
5,Greatest hazelnut chocolates ever!,"These chocolates are such a great find! I was looking for a special type of hazelnut chocolate called gianduja. I searched for it and found this perfect selection! It is the smoothest, creamiest hazelnut chocolate I have found. A little on the pricey side but TOTALLY WORTH IT! People I know who aren't that crazy about chocolate or hazelnut chocolate specifically have LOVED it and wanted more! I bought some during the Christmas season and shared it (out of holiday spirit) but kind of wish I had saved more for myself!"
5,I'm 13 and thought it was superb,"This book was one of the best foaling guides I have ever read. It was easy to read and understand. Richard Maxwell is an expert in his field, and all of his methods were very simple for my warmblood foal to understand. I would highly recommend this book to horsepeople of all ages."
1,It should have been obvious,"Please don't waste your money. Their is no way your car seat or couch will ever look good again unless you have it re-upholstered or you buy a new one. Everyone wants this product to work, but when you try it is obvious that you are trying to cover something up--no good."
5,"A soul-bearing, get-up and do something, rock 'n' roll tune.","Live Forever delivers a rush of emotion and drives the listener to bear their soul and think about what they could achieve in life. It pushes the desperate to a higher plane of optimism in it's bear-bone lyricism and uplifting guitar solo that allows the protagonist believe in himself, and take life by the balls. Gallagher's lyrics reveal the struggle in all and the undiscovered ability of the mass to kick the ass of adversity. Through an arrogant optimism, Live Forever relays the feelings of a nation of 20 somethings, which drives them to ask questions of their 'petit' lives and makes them ask - 'why not?'"
2,Not for everybody,"While in theory this should be an excellent choice, there are couple issues:PROS:- very nice looking, quick charging- shaves both dry and wet- not expensive- has good nose hair trimmer includedCONS:- Does not shave at all if you have a strong facial hair, I don't mean long beard, but thick & strong. It may work if you have a ""normal"" or thin hair. For me it works in some areas and in other it simply does not do what it is supposed to do.Therefore, only two stars from me."
3,Nice shaver but not close enough for me.,"I've been a Remington user, but decided to try the Panasonic primarily because of the wet/dry shaving capabilities. It's a nice shaver, well designed, and easy to use, but it just didn't shave as close, either wet or dry, as my old Remington. Amazon makes it easy to return items, so I did, and ordered a new Remington. The Remington shaves much closer, however it is louder than the Panasonic, which is a very quiet shaver. Anyway, I like the Remington better."
3,Don't use it,I got this book for ENG 111. Honestly I don't even read this book. My teacher even told us the first day of class during orientation that we would most likely not even touch this book for the entire semester.
3,Text for English class,I was required to buy this book for an English class that I should not have needed. Had I actually needed this course then this text would have been more useful as it seemed to be a good reference and workbook that illustrated different writing techniques and concepts.
3,Just okay,"For a couple boxes... they weren't too bad. But 12 boxes is probably about 10 too many. I won't complain since I spent less than a dollar a box, but I would certainly never pay full price for them. They are organic, which is nice, but they don't taste anything like pop-tarts, so I unfortunately have a little trouble getting my toddler to eat them. Unless you know you REALLY love this variety or you plan to share it with another family or two, I wouldn't recommend a case this big. Over all though, the product isn't bad, but it's by no means fantastic."
4,"Finally, toaster pastries that are good for you!!!",It is very hard to find organic products where I live. I had bought a box when I was travelling and my kids loved them. I was so happy to be able to order a case through Amazon. We just finished our final box and my kids want to know what flavor we're going to order next. Thanks for making it so easy to purchase!
5,Organic Pastries,"As our mornings are hectic, it's great that I can grab an organic breakfast for my boys to eat on the run. They do not taste like regular ""Pop-Tarts"", but we all really like them and will keep them stocked in our pantry."
3,I Wanted To Like This Book,"I really wanted to like this book since it was the only one in my local book store and I needed a reference.I've read other reviews saying this book was developed as a reference for developers. Unfortunately every time I pick it up as a reference I am truly disappointed.The worst aspect is the book's index. I can not recall the last time I found anything I needed in the index. For example, I quickly needed to read the details on NEXTVAL (or however you spell it). As soon as I'm done with this review (this was the straw that broke the camel's back), I'll call up Google and find the answer. I can not recall any definition I've needed that I found in the index of this book.Of secondary distaste is the treatment of basic syntax. This is less of a reference to the syntax than the Linux psql 'h' command provides. I wouldn't buy this book again if there was a better alternative. In fact, I'm leaning towards MySQL as a replacement since documentation seems to be better."
3,Not for begginers - A little tricky to figure out,"It is a nice tool and it open your mind to new things. The way it is prepared can get a little tricky though. It took me A WHILE to figure out how to use it etc. If you are a beginner, do not get this book."
4,Right on,"Oh these crazy English blues boys have got the 'tude alright, but have they got the songs? The answer is mostly yes, even if they manage the feat of being more derivative than Jet. This live record is mostly decent to good blues-punk but it's debut single ""Such a Fool"" which casts an overwhelming shadow of brilliance over everything else. No doubt about it - on the strength of that song, it's clear that these guys have potential."
2,NOT as good as Amazon gauge!,"I bought this hoping to have a lower cost model for my son's car. Unfortunately it is more cumbersome than the basic plastic bodied one it replaces, and also reads 2psi low on a 32psi tire. I DO suggest biting the bullet and getting the Amazon Basics Programmable Digital Tire Gauge for over twice the price. It's a bit larger and DID match exactly with the tire shop's reading.I will update this if Accutire offers me any way to recalibrate this."
2,Accurate... for a while,"Takes a very accurate reading. i have no beef with that. HOWEVER, the part that goes on the tire valve and partially opens the shrader valve is entirely plastic. after nearly daily use, it only lasted a couple of months. The tip broke off inside and no longer opens the tire valve to get a reading. I will be need to buy a different one."
4,No problems here,The gauge is accurate (as tested against my garage mechanic's own gauge) and simple to use. The only problem I had was losing a bit of air but that ended once I got used to handling the tool. A handy product for a low price.
5,Easy to Use!,This Accutire Tire Gauge is one of the top-rated models in Consumer Reports. It is easy to use and extremely accurate.
4,Backside label contains wrong info.,"On the back side of the cover(container, box? I do not know the best word), there are instructions and specifications.It reads 0-100 deg. F (-18 to 33 * C).It is right that 0 degree F is -18 degree C.However, it is wrong that 100 degree F is 33 degree C. It's 38 degree C.Some people may think that this typo itself is not a big deal.I agree, but it undermines credibility of the manufacturer."
1,Does't have a pressure relief pin,"Gage works fine, but does not include a pin to let pressure out of the tire. How many of you hit the pressure you want exactly? You pump and usually end up with a bit of overpressure that needs to be bleed off. But with this gage I need another device to bleed off the pressure. Unless I'm missing somehting."
1,terrible,this thing does not work at all....what a waste of money. I would rather have a regular old fashioned gauge.twice in a row i got 5 PSI and then 53 PSI... and then the garage's gauge said it was 27 (which was accurate).
4,very practical,"everyone should have one in their vehicle, saves time and money and for me the digital display is perfect. Works great, would recommend."
2,"Worthless, locked on 0.00 the day after I got it.","I actually bought two of these: the first locked on 0.00 the day after I got it, a month later my wife's did the same thing."
4,"Approval, with suggestion","This tire gauge works very well, and is consistent in its readings. At first, I had difficulty finding just the right angle of approach so as NOT to allow air to escape. Once that was done, the gauge more than fulfilled expectations.I have one suggestion to the manufacturer: YOUR INSTRUCTIONS SHOULD INCLUDE AN ALERT TO REMOVE DISPLAY'S PROTECTIVE COVER."
4,Great product with a little work,"They use a battery separator that has adhesive on it, the adhesive residue on the batteries and contacts make the unit appear to be DOA.Open up the battery door, take out the batteries, clean the contacts and batteries, put back together and it works perfectly.It would be much better if they used a plastic isolator strip without adhesive.Unit works great, accurate and I was able to check tire pressure in twilight without a flashlight.It seals well, it is a consumer grade product but for under $10 delivered to my door a great product."
1,STOP! READ this review before buying this product!!!,"Loved this product while it worked, but it has a very short lifespan!. Everyone search for "" L "" (with a space before and after) in Amazon's reviews of this product. There are scores of people who have had the same problem."
5,Works great,"Just what I was looking for. Works great - I've never had a problem getting a reading. Seems accurate enough, it reads about the same as anothe gauge I have."
2,Accutire battery life,I had the same problem with battery life. The cost is not so important as is the discovery of dead batteries at the time you need to use the gauge. I would not buy it again.
4,Easy to use.,I bought it based on Consumer Reports rating. It is very easy to use and I am happy with it. I bought one for my daughter also.
2,Disposable,Worked fine for 3 weeks now it allways reeds -00-.Maybe its just mine but i am disappointed in this product.
3,Great until the battery dies then..,"I have three of these. They work great...The battery went out on one and so I replaced it (CR2032)But after that, the unit displayed 1.0 as the reading. I assume it needs calibration, but..There are no instructions and you can't contact the company.They do not return snail Mail (warrantee address) and the website has no support.Yes, I can throw this one away, but the company appears non-green and irresponsible.I will look to replace with something else.Very irritating"
2,Two down...,"This gauge lasted two days, then locked up on ""00.0"". Same thing happened to a much fancier version made by the same firm, but after 2 years of use.Called the manufacturer: ""Send it back, it needs to be calibrated.""That was three weeks ago. Nothing from them--presume they have been getting a load of returns.I'll not buy a third product from this manufacturer. Looks like they are selling defective designs."
4,Quite nice,Works as it should. Accuracy seems just fine since it matches with other gages I use...backlit display is especially convenient.
5,Works great,"I liek the digital gauge, and keep it in my car. I don't know why we have to write so many words but nonetheless I like the gauge it works perfectly and arrived quickly."
5,Great Tire Gauge,"I had read a review in a magazine that said this was a very accurate tire gauge and it is, I bought 2 to have in each car and am glad I did. The one vehicle has a tire monitoring system and I use to have to go around the car 2 or 3 times to get the dash light to go out with these one time and your done."
5,Easy To Use,This is a great product. Works the way it should and I think it is pretty accurate. Easy to read also.
2,"accurate, but difficult to use","This gauge is accurate and easy to read, but it is very difficult to get a good seal. There is no rubber inside the stem and you have to get the right angle to get a good seal. In the meantime air is escaping and its a game to get the tire pressure right where you want it."
4,Great Stocking Stuffer - and they USE it!,"I bought these three years ago for stocking stuffers for all the men on my list. I have repeatedly heard from ALL of them how much they loved them and use them on a regular basis. In fact, this year they are getting the digital read ones again. I know the batteries don't last tremendously long but at this price who cares?"
3,Odd results,I get odd or inconsistent results with this gauge on my motorcycle. If I use it 2x's in a row sometimes the second reading is higher than the 1st. I would not buy it again. I kinda don't trust it. NOTE: I did not buy it from Amazon. I got it at a store.
1,Don't buy this crap,"I bought this one a few years ago. It looked great and worked great, too, for over 1 year. I actually used it for about 10 times. Then, the battery was dead. You MUST disassemble it to pieces in order to get out the battery. I just throw it away."
2,Junk,"I didnt have this 2 months and it came apart, ended up buying a different one by SlimeI wouldnt waste my money on another one"
3,"Like the clear display, light. Broke after 2 uses.",I like the clear display and the lighted display too. Only trouble was after 2 times using I felt like something pushed in and there wasn't any diplay. Luckily it was a quick fix I could handle. I took fine nose pliers and slightly and gently pulled the protruding plastic piece that lies in the middle of the gauge where the valve stem sits in and pulled it out. I felt a little movement and it works. Saved an exchange. Hopefully will last a few years now.
2,Batteries dont' last long,"I have one of the originals without the backlit display, probably 10 years now, and it still works great. I guess there is some non-replaceable battery inside. Then I bought two of these new ones for my kids. The replaceable batteries don't last but 2 years or so (I guess that's what the ""L"" in the display means, I no longer have whatever instructions came with them.) But, when I buy $6 of fresh 357 batteries (says they are compatible with LR44), the display still shows ""L""... done that on both gauges I bought. What a waste, I guess something else is wrong. Gimme the old non-backlit ones that don't wear out the batteries.The thing works great for a couple years, then nothing. Not good."
1,do not purchase,"I would not recommend this product because it is not accurate. a digital machine like this should keep its measurements at all time but this one for some reason keep changing its measurements depending on the weather. When is very cold, it gives you the wrong preasure. I would stick to the simple non ditital tire gaufes."
1,Inferior Product NOT Recommended,I selected this product after reading the reviews here on Amazon. I ordered two. One for each car. One of the two units didn't work at all. The other one wasn't accurate when compared to two other tire gauges. Very disappointing. Obviously there is not quality control in the manufacturing process for these tire gauges. What's the likelihood of two units being bad? I don't recommend this product at all.
3,Batteries Died After 6 Months,"Accurate and great for 6 months, then you have to switch the batteries, if you don't mind the hassle(I do)then buy."
5,Dr Stan - NASA Engineer,"Have only used it once on riding lawn mower. Worked like a ""charm."" Seals to valve stem with no leakage. Have three (3) vehicles and various other lawn equipment which I will also be using it on. Mine did not come with a cover over the display, so I had no ""false"" readings like some reported."
3,Works but man does it make me want to vomit.,"I've noticed positive changes with this, but have also experienced soooooo much nausea. Even if I take it with food it makes me nauseous. I like that its a metabolism booster, but I wish the side effects weren't so strong. I took one about 5 hours ago and I'm still feeling queezy. I'm sure One-A-Day can improve this product somehow."
1,SAVE YOUR MONEY AND YOUR STOMACH!,"This is the worst multivitamin I have ever taken. Do research on the net before purchasing it - a lot of people are either nauseous or vomitting.I too got nauseous - to the point that I was gagging in the toilet. It was always within 1 1/2 hours of taking the vitamin. And for all you folks who said to eat first - I did! I always have a complete fibre cereal breakfast - and I tried taking the multivitamin anywhere from right before I ate to 1 hour after eating - it didn't matter, I got sick every time.Further more, my partner tried it as well. He had heart palpitations and had to see a doctor when he was on it.Stay clear - and SAVE YOUR MONEY - and your stomach!"
4,Too Much Of A Gap Between Love's Unfolding Dream,"For the most part, I've enjoyed all the DVDs of the ""Love Come Softly,"" series. However, this particular DVD leaves too many gaps between the ""Love's Unfolding Dream."" Due to the fact that Drew dies, she looses her faith. I wished we had a DVD of her training in medical school. Another factor is that Sarah Jones is lacking insofar as the ""Belinda,"" character. Why didn't Scout-Taylor Compton play Belinda? It would have been better to have someone with red hair? My major gripe is the yucky blonde wig that Sarah Jones is wearing. It seems to me it would not have cost that much money to have her dye her hair or get red-haired actress. Sarah Jones is a poor choice for Belinda. Haylie Duff is an awesome selection for Annie."
2,Love Takes Wing,"I own all the movies to this series. I was very disapointed with the seventh. It couldn't compare to the first two episodes. And why is it when we christians recommend these movies to our friends they have to start putting profanity in the movies? The seventh movie has a ""D"" word or a ""H"" word in it, which was unnessary. I will for now on, check and see if there is profanity in it before I purchase it."
3,Very Detailed,"This book is amazing in the depth that it covers the subject. I was actually looking for a book with a little less sophistication, IE just pictures of different kinds of wood and descriptions. This book is a little over my head so to speak"
1,YEP ITS WOOD,"Identifying wood? :picks a stick up: YEP ITS WOOD........Btw, anyone else find the title/picture cover a bit sexually over toned? He really has that hard long piece of wood near his face, GREAT BOOK!"
3,Great looking game BUT.....,"I've enjoyed playing Tiger Woods for the last 2 years on the XBox. I've been excited for the last year knowing that we will finally be able to play online via XBox Live with the 2005 version.I just confirmed that EA Sports has made this version so that only 2 people, that's right, only TWO can play online at a time. What happened to being able to play 3 other people (4 at a time) online???Links (from Microsoft) has been out for a year now and one of the best things about that game is that you can have a foursome, just like regular golf.Tiger Woods 2005 has all the bells and whistles to make a great looking game, however, one of the key selling points for me was being able to play with 4 people online. There are many of us who have been playing Links for the last year waiting for the new Tiger Woods version, and now we are not going to purchase it. It looks like we'll be staying with Links for another year.Too bad EA Sports, you really dropped the ball on this one."
1,Wanted: Dead or Alive: PASSION,"What is it with Barenboim,, dosen't he have a drop a hot blood!This is among the most sluggish of Walkure recordings.And the singers. it's no wonder most of them have fallen into obscurity in the last 10 years. Nadine Secunde walks through the role of Sieglinde not a moment of passion is expressed in this glorious opera. Paul Elming may be happier singing Bellini.The rest is second rate. Most of Barenboim's Wagner recording are rather hit and miss with the singers. if you need the glorious digital sound then this recording will do well along side a few others. I think the Karl Bohm recording is the most satisfying.The glories of that recording being Nilsson and Rysanek even James King is solid as Siegmund....For those who don't need sound please try the second act from San Fransico 1936 conducted by Fritz Reiner. This performance is the one by which all should be judged."
2,a bit lazy,Not much new in this recycled history of the Cold War. Presents the story from the exclusive standpoint of American policy makers.
2,I Now Know That Gaddis Needs To Stay Away From History,"If this book is one of your options for a history class and you have other options, choose again please!. it is for your sake i say this. this book has the hardest thesis to pic out of any history book i have read. i find myself wondering ""john lewis gaddis"" how in the world did he end up involved with a history book at oxford press. he cant seem to stay on his subject of ""the cold war"" i give this book 2 stars because its sentance structures are not as horible as many history books. john lewis gaddis has potencial as an author as long as he stays away from history books. if you are not intending to read this book for you education, but rather for the plesure, i advise you to look some where else..."
3,AI Woes,"This current installation of the NHL franchise is, for the most part a solid game, with familiar controls and management options. My one beef is the AI: I had fun playing the game on every setting up to, but not including difficult. Playing on this setting sapped all the fun out of the game! You could be playing as one of the best teams in the league against, say, the Florida panthers or Columbus bluejackets, outshoot them 10 to 1, and still be losing 2-0! While it seems their goalie is the lord reborn on skates, your goalie is acting like he's rookie who's never seen the game played before. While he will be, in truth, better than half-decent, it doesn't stack up against the computer's seemingly flawless goaltending. I don't know, maybe it's just me. Overall, though, a really fun game, especially playing free-for-all modes with friends."
4,Very nice and affordable,"These hose guides are very nice, heavy and handsome. And considering how many you get for the price, quite the bargain."
3,Not worth the money,"The book is well written and enjoyable to read if you are say on a business trip and brought no other book with you. If you have been injured before and have read about your injury on the internet this book is a waste of money. As another reviewer said, there is nothing in this book that you cannot get for free online. I cannot say I learned another new BUT I did enjoy reading the book."
1,Can't tie one on,"The tie down broke off on day one, as I was tying it on. Nice fabric, poor construction."
2,"Okay if not in water, just in air",This product is just okay. After having it for a year the cover gets easily dirty. After a couple of rainstorms the cover ripped. This is the second cover we have had. I am thinking about giving up on covers for patio furniture at this point.
1,"Horrible, does not withstand elements",I purchased this to cover my outdoor glass table and iron chairs. It took forever to get to me so I didn't get to test it out for a real winter. This year I did and it was horrible. The space between the table and chairs creates a sag in the material which proceeds to fill with water and then rip. My poor table and chairs now look awful and since it is outside the return period nothing will be done. I would highly recommend you do not purchase this if it will come in contact with water (and I am not sure why you would order it if not).
5,Excellent description of Cruise ship design,"A very well researched and interestingly written description of how cruise ships have evolved. While another reviewer is correct that some of the illustrations have one reaching for a magnifying glass, there isn't really a way round showing illustrations like this in a standard format book - and it is better to have them than not. Highly recommended."
5,Works Great,"I've had this product for over a year and it works great. I use it on hardwood and tile floors. It does a great job cleaning the floors - the proof is in the water tank after cleaning (yuk!). Don't expect it to pick up large particals, you do need to sweep first. Tough / sticky areas may need multi passes. I find if I go over the area and let the solution sit for a few seconds most spots come up easily. The unit is fairly loud. I hate mops and bucket and this is a great alternative, allowing me to clean large areas quickly. Highly recommend."
3,Average Tool,"Definitely a notch or two better than a mop, but not a miracle machine. I like that it has rotating scrub brushes for thorough cleaning and that, for the most part, it sucks up the dirty water. If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably purchase this item. But it's not the world's greatest, if you know what I mean..."
2,Works good but will not buy it again,"I bought this product after reading the reviews from previous buyers, but is not as they say, is kind of heavy to move from room to room, the spinscrub does not have enough power. I went to a local store and I found a better hard floor cleaning, small, light and alot more cheaper."
1,Floor still dirty after using this - slow and ineffective.,"Using the Floormate is much slower than using a brush and wet rags with cleaner, as I normally do. You have to work across the floor really slowly to get the Floormate to clean at all. Mainly it just redistributes the dirt in streaks on the floor. As a test, I pushed a wet terry-cloth towel across the floor after I had 'washed' it with the Floormate - it was filthy after only a couple of yards! This machine is not fit for purpose. You will be much better off and be quicker (and will be getting a workout), by using muscle-power, a deck brush and terry-towels to wash your floor."
3,Doesn't suck,"This is my third Hoover Floormate and maybe mine is defective but I do not find that it sucks the water up the way it should. I went back to my old Floormate without the rotating brushes and found it actually did a better job, was lighter weight and easier to use, got into smaller areas (between toilet and wall in some bathrooms), left much less water on the floor and was almost half the price. According to Hoover I can take it in for service that means driving over 30 miles each way. I definitely would never be without a Floormate but this one I can do without."
1,Defective Unit,"My unit was obviously defective. Brushes would spin, but no solution dispensed, as well as the unit turning itself on and off. Went thru all the trouble-shooting techniques in the book, nothing worked, although the attachments/hose dispensed fluid and had suction. Must've been something wrong in the connection in the fluid-flow switch on the handle. Thank goodness for Amazon's return policy!"
5,It works!,"I have a house full of hardwood floors, cleaning them is not so hard, but leaving them looking good without streaks is a real problem, the spinscrub takes the work out it, it's quick, easy and not horribly noisy. I am amazed that it removes so much dirt, particularly kitchen spills such as dried jam or other sticky junk that would normally have to be scraped up before mopping. Its kind of a bulky thing - I wish that the attachment storage was differnt it just seems awkward to have the attachment holder on the front of the machine requiring removal before you can use it, but I can live with that"
1,Hoover H3060 Floormate SpinScrub 800 Review,This product has very little to recommend it. The attachments are virtually useless--they do not spin or scrub. You are better off purchasing hand scrubbers from Walmart. They'd be cheaper and occupy less room. The cleaning solution that is made for it is also worthless. It is possible to use tile cleaner instead (it won't damage the machine!) and this works better. I still have to use a hand scrubber in combination with the SpinScrub in order to get my tile floors clean!
2,"Easy to use, but doesn't do a great job.","The floormate 800 is very easy to use. You fill the clean tank with water and solution, turn it on and start scrubbing. However, the scrubbing brushes barely touch the floor. This machine does a great job on moderately dirty floors, but if there's any sort of heavy dirt - the floormate does not scrub it away. I've been using the floormate to do the general cleaning on my floors, but then I have to get on my hands and knees and manually scrub all of the tough stains. A Mr. Clean Magic Easer took out every stain that the floor mate could not.As for the scrubbing attachments, they do work well (especially the grout tool) but they seem a liitle flimsy and I hope they last."
2,absorbs too much ink,"This paper is too thin, I keep getting it mixed up with my regular printer paper. I have to pull the package to see which paper it is."
1,Save your money...,"A total waste - 250 tips that just state the obvious - I feellike I've been outsmarted out of $ by ""Smartiepants"" -don't you be too...."
4,Good Replacement Battery,"This battery extended the portable use of my old Thinkpad T43 laptop to 2 and 3/4 hours. My old battery couldn't do better than 1 and 1/2 hours. Older laptops normally do not have the duration that newer ones have with their extended-life batteries, but the boost I got from this one suits me just fine. Replacing my old one was a snap since this fit into the battery chamber perfectly. All in all, I'm very satisfied."
2,Worked fine until it stopped working,"The battery worked fine for about 9 months (the length of the warranty period), then stopped holding a charge and had to be replaced. Convenient timing, and pretty disappointing from a buyer's perspective. Won't go with these guys again."
2,Don't bother.,"I bought this kit thinking the digital tire gauge would be great. I guess it would be great IF I could actually read it when it was on the tire. I can never seem to position it so I can see the readout. The pliers and flashlight are useful, but I already had those. The bottom line is that I am disappointed with this purchase."
3,Not Free SF Reader,"A strange megalithic type sculpture exists on Pluto, the cause of a lot of controversy. Is it alien, or a man-made hoax, or what?The backdrop of the story is the political conflict because of a Martian revolution. The researchers sent on a mission to look at this artifact are split along these lines and may end up being hijacked.The book looks at the Icehenge from three different points of time, in three novellas, I suppose, spread across several centuries."
1,Convoluted Read,Icehenge is a science fiction book that isn't easy to follow. It involves a futuristic search for how icehenge (take off on stonehenge in England?) got on the planet Pluto. The search is convoluted and nonsensical.
5,Grand Slam,"Their first time up to bat, The Stylistics hit a grand slam and thier follow-up, Round 2, was a grand slam too!"
1,save the $$,"This product LOOKS very practical, but it is SOOOO not. The milk leaks out when the container is heated either from the adaptor or from the nipple attachment. I contacted avent about this problem and it turns out you are not supposed to use the same nipples for the nurser that you use for the avent bottles because they don't fit. Who has time to go thru nipples and separate them out when they look EXACTLY the same. Waste of money if you ask me. Stick with the bottles for storing milk, they worked much better for me."
5,mahabharata,"An excellent book and reasonably priced. The wisdom between the covers of this book is worth it's weight in goldMahabharata: The Greatest Spiritual Epic of All TimeI love every page. The version by Krisna Dharma is what I refer to.The book arrived in beautiful condition and in timely fashion.Sincere thanks, Andy. Pax et Bonum."
3,Expected better,"This book is fine as a sort of cliff's notes to get acquainted with the storyline of one of the most important pieces of world literature of all time. But I feel strongly that KD's turning it into a juicy melodrama is the wrong treatment to give such an important work. The subtitle of this book is ""The Greatest Spiritual Epic of All Time."" I would make it ""The Greatest Spiritual Epic of All Time, reduced to the level of a vacuous soap opera."" That's how it reads, anyway.If you're into Mary Higgins Clark or Dungeons and Dragons, etc., you will love this rendering. As for people with more criteria, prepare yourselves for the awkwardness of paramount characters like Arjuna and Krishna reduced to the likes of, say, Fabio."
4,Good bang for buck!,"I just got this camcorder yesterday and the unit is pretty impressive. It's very light has a comfy feel in your hand and took a 5 minute sequence of around my home and downloaded it on my comp using just the USB cable and I must say the quality is pretty acceptable. I encountered no dropped frames and the VCD quality as I said earlier is good. Have to try out the firewire output once I get the cable. Low-light quality is good (especially with Night-Shot) and the only complaint I have is the field of view when fully zoomed out seems limited, didn't see that covered in any of the reviews I've read. Would have been better if I could get wider angle but I am pretty satisfied. I'd definly recommend it. I wish they'd provided the firewire cable too, who uses USB these days to capture video?"
3,Is there something wrong with mine?,"Well the camcorder is aesthetically pleasing, but the software is just plain horrible. My boyfried is a computer wiz and couldn't figure it out. We had to install it three times before it even loaded all the components. Now my computer runs really slow and it takes about 10 minutes for 2 minutes of tape to transfer. As for the still photo, you can shoot it without the 7 seconds of sound. It's in the manual. You tap the button lightyly for just the image, and hold it down longer for the audio recording. I read the software manual and still wasn't able to view the still pictures in the Picture Package. The indoor lighting was bad, but I guess i'll just have to adjust it manually. Overall the picture is good but the software is horrible."
2,Inaccurate product details,"The description of the product is not for the product as it appears in the ""Product Details"" part. The description the seller is providing to buyers, is refering to the shipping box, which didn't make any sense to me. What do I want the shipping box description for?Now, I wanted the pot for a project, it was important for me to match the real dimentions of the pot. It may work for you, looks like a nice pot for other purposes."
1,A worthy flop,"Looks as if Bobby Brown's cocky attitude got the best of him. After successfully re-teaming with New Edition and then bashing his group (Brown claimed he could make as much money on his own rather than having to split it with 5 other people...so it's all about money, eh Bob?), Bobby Brown released this mess, and it sold approximately no copies. No hit singles. Not a redeeming tune. Not to mention a horrible attitude. Bobby Brown is over. I'm sure he will not be missed."
3,"Good album, but 5 years out of date; sounds so 1992!","Bobby Brown's Forever has to be the most forgettable of the four studio albums that he's done. While he still sounds good vocally, especially on Feelin' Inside, the album's only hit, the music sounds very outdated. It sounds so 1992 on the uptempo songs and 1994-sounding on the ballads. And the R&B music scene had moved on after the new jack swing trend. Brown wrote and produced most of this album, but it doesn't have the soulful punch of Don't Be Cruel or the dance-heavy feel of Bobby. Trust me, Bobby's a dynamic singer and wants you to forget about his run ins with the law and focus more on his music. But this album is the only one I've listened to the least. He doesn't bring anything new to the table. Hopefully, after the Being Bobby Brown show that airs on Bravo, he will finally put out the album that expresses his talents the best."
3,bobby brown is a good singer and ilove his songs.,bobby brown is a good singer and good dancer! while ilove his music and i think he is agood husbend and good farther in the world! my favorite song is rock with you and every little step. bobby is a sexey man ilove to meet! ps bobby is very nice looking singer!
2,Not Worth The Money,"I would spend a little more money and buy a better quality camera. The picture quality was not good at all. I previously owned another Kodak camera with the same Megapixels and the picture quality on that camera was much better. Just after a year of using the Kodak C300 camera, it stopped working and I did not use it that much. I now own the Sony Cybershot DSC-W50 that takes great pictures, I haven't had any problems with it and I have been using it on an almost daily basis since May 2006."
1,Broke on the second day...,"While price is attractive and features are decent for the price, reliability is an issue. It stopped working on the second day of our vacation, which was very inconvenient to say the least.Back to the store it went."
3,i liked the camera.,i like the camera the only thing i was a bit disappointed in is the amount of pictures it could hold 17 in all. i expected at least 25 could have been stored. i guess i;ll have to by more memory.
2,Not Impressed,"It's inexpensive, I'll give it that. You get what you pay for though. This might be a good camera for a kid but if you want a nicer camera go with a Casio or a Canon. The camera looks cheap and the quality isn't great."
2,Not for textured tubs,"Our tub has very fine texture on the bottom and there was no way this mat would stick, wet or dry. I've purchased individual tub stickers from Target store and they won't work either."
2,What an unbelievable liar,"First of all, Mr. Barris needs to stop drinking or doing drugs. He is blending famous people from later decades into the story line. Charles Barkley was probably in high school in 1978 but Chuck drops his name as though he was a famous pro basketball player in 78. Oprah Winfrey, had no idea who she was prior to 1986, yet she is also referenced as a famous person in 78. I know I am nitpicking here, however, reading a work of fiction requires a certain suspension of disbelief and Mr Barris ruins any hope through bad time distortion."
5,"Enchanting voice, masterful interpretation, great songs","Beatnik Boys, the latest CD from Maureen Andrews, is much more than a pleasant surprise -- it's a love song to the past and the future..from top to bottom, Beatnik Boys, exudes heartfelt honesty...This album is a gem that will appeal to all sorts of music lovers. Maureen's songs, along with her enchanting voice, stand far above the rest. From the opening, self-penned track to her wonderful rendition of the 60s Hollies' classic, ""I Can't Let Go"", Beatnik Boys is convincing proof that Andrews is an artist to pay attention to."
1,VERY UNHAPPY!!!!!,"Harmon\Kardon seriously let me down with this below standard product. Let me start with the 1 good thing. They fit my ears. But what good is it to fit my ear if they sound like CRAP! The come in some fancy case that I don't care about because you cant use the case for any thing. But the sound quality is just sooooo poor. I tried every different eq setting that I have on my ipod, but none could make these earbuds sound worth a crap. They have no bass, no distinction what so ever in levels of music. I listen to all genres of music and none of them sounded worth listening to. I used them for about 5 minutes and went back to the earbuds I got with my ipod that hurt my ears. I had actually rather be uncomfortable with the others than I had listen to these pieces of crap.I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THESE TO MY WORST ENEMY!!!!!!!!!!"
1,Garbage Cans,"I just wasted $100 on a pair of these, because I loved the Soundsticks so much. These are junk; maybe fine for AM talk radio and MIDI; they actually suck the life out of music. (Even Stevie Wonder becomes flat and unfunky!) I will throw them away, and my wife and I will continue to fight over her regulation i-pod headphones, until I can pick up a set of those."
3,Factual and inclusive but lacking spirit,"I bought this book at the same time as the new one volume Butler's Lives of the Saints, edited by Paul Burns. McBrien's book is certainly well researched and inclusive in terms of gender, race, class, and denomination. However the entries are focussed more on biographical information than the spirit or charism of each saint. You will know when they lived and what they did but not how they thought, felt, and prayed. Butler's Lives of the Saints is equally well researched, and just as inclusive (without being self-righteous about it, as McBrien tends to be), but you also get a sense of the spirituality of the saints, which is the whole point of reading about them. McBrien's material about Pope JP II's mania for beatification/canonization is interesting, but better to read it at your local library and spend your money on the new Butler's Lives of the Saints."
2,Not at all what I was expecting,"I was expecting an in-your-face, swinging big band Christmas album. What I got was a handbells, a brass choir, a children's chorus, pipe organ, and strings. Doc is fantastic, of course, but this is just average easy listening Christmas music. Most tunes are simply Muzak string arrangements, and several tracks don't even have Doc or the band playing. The better tracks include Let It Snow, March Of The Toys, and Jingle Bells. I bought this disc with no preview, solely on the recommendation of a Houston radio DJ. I learned my lesson - always listen to the samples!"
1,Not what advertised,"Simply awful. First of all, the trumpet's stated brand is ""Hisonic"", not Signature. Second, and more important, one of the valve guides was already worn, making the valve stick, and I'm having a lot of trouble trying to fix it. I wish I had payed an extra hundred bucks for a workable instrument; this one is not."
5,Absolutely Stunning,"I purchased two of these pendants for Christmas presents for the girls in the family and one for myself. All i can say is this is not only a beautiful pendant but also a very durable one. The top and bottom pieces of the pendant rotate and at first i was scared it would break easily...NOT SO! I'm still wearing it and i never have taken it off except a few times to clean it. I get so many compliments on it, and in the sun it casts rainbows everywhere :) Shipping was speedy and the product was great!"
2,She is so much better now,I have read all Joyce Maynard's books and was looking forward to reading her first novel. I was so disappointed and finally gave up after 100 pages. She is so good so read all her other books as they are fabulous.
4,Moonlight Remixed,"""Can't Fight The Moonlight"" was all ready a danceable pop tune, but with this maxi-single Dance Mixes collection, it has been revamped into a dance club thumper. Such notable remixers as Almighty and Thunderpuss take part, providing some club credibility. The first three remixes are radio edits of remixes by Graham Stack (great mix), Thunderpuss (my favorite radio edit), and Plasmic Honey (an okay edit, not my favorite). The next four tracks are lengthier club mixes and club edits. Almighty provide the stand out remix here, with a bit of a hard intro, slowly softening into LeAnn's vocals. The Sharp Club Vocal Edit plays around with the vocals a bit too much for my liking, a tad annoying. Extended versions of Thunderpuss & Plasmic Honey's radio edits are also here, both are actually quite better than the short versions. The last is Sharp's attempt at a dub mix (Sharp Pistol Dub), but this grows tiring fast, and is perhaps the worst remix of the song."
3,not a dance song,"I had heard the original version of ""can't fight the moonlight"" from coyote ugly and loved it and then i went out and bought the dance remixes and was totally in shock. They have completely ruined the song. It sounds like it is out of tune and speeded up and sometimes you even forget what song it's meant to be. Don't get me wrong, I like trance music but this song really sounds silly as trance/dance remixes. If you like the song, then buy the original version and not the dance remixes."
3,"BEWARE RHEINGOLD FANS, What happened to Fricka's line ""Wo weilst du, Wotan?""","They didn't have the microphones on and missed the whole line! UNREALthis could have been a great Rhinegold, but that whole beautiful entrance is inaudable.in the booklet it's page 226, track 19.right before Donners thunder scene.so 3 not 5 stars."
1,Bold but not good,"I wanted a Das rheingold only on a CD just for listening(you'll never consider this production on a DVD).After reading some reviews i ended up with this one here for the promised good recording sound.And it was not as graded at all.Bold but not good.Too high and a lot of noise around the singers or the musical orchestra.Such a cacophony was not tolerable to me.And of course i did send it back to the seller who had nothing to do with the worst ""wagner"" Das rheingold i ever had to listen to.Forget by who ?(D. Barenboim) and from where ? (Bayreuth festival live) even for a bargain forget it. It's a waste of ""time""...hooup!"
2,Accutire gauge,"Gauge failed after one month of use, suppect Lithum battery. Tried contacting Accutire warranty by their internet site but that was useless.Returned gauge per printed instructions (using certified mail so I know they got it ) over one month ago and still no response to either calls or e-mail."
3,Not the best Twain out there,"It was interesting, but there is so much more that is better. If you want to cover everything that Twain ever wrote, well sure, read it. But otherwise I wouldn't bother."
5,Even puppets deserve a good soundtrack,This is easily one of the most beautiful fantasy soundtracks I've ever heard in a movie. It has a very soft quality to it. The soundtrack makes what is essentially a puppet show seem like a real epic. I only wish the -disc version were still available...
5,Absolutely delightful,"This is a sweet story you won't mind sharing with your child again and again. The illustrations are first rate, each page has its own color palate as the story progresses from evening to dawn (armadillos are nocturnal, after all!). My three year old has a new best friend!The publishers also did a great job on the printing. The images are crisp, the paper is of good quality so that the colors jump out at you.Good for kids or adults who are collectors of picture books."
2,"Raw, unrefined piece of work.","Seems REA does not hire part - time workers to write reviews for them.As a national biology olympiad winner, I strongly recommend you not to buy this book because of its hazy wordings, somewhat incorrect questions, and overall mediocre quality of the test."
2,full of errors,"you'd think that since this is a second edition, mistakes from the first would be fixed. but no, they're still here. like a question that says gene mutations *aren't* inherited, when in fact they sometimes are. and then there are misleading questions that i get wrong not because i don't know biology, but because of unclear wording. it doesn't even have a chart so that you can convert your raw score into a 200-800 score. the only good thing is that this book contains 6 tests, more than most books.what do you expect from a book written partly by a community college professor, an enviromental science teacher, and an assistant professor (also at a community college)?"
2,Wow that was a waste of time,"Don't waste your time with this book, kaplan and other books are deffinately better. Their review of everything is basically just deffinitions and they go way in depth in areas that don't even matter, and then they ask you questions that are incredibly specific to a certain area that will deffinately not show up in the SAT bio test. Seriously the book asks what adaptations will an aquatic animal need FIRST in order to adapt to an artic enviroment. I took the SAT bio and it needs you to know the general concept of evolution not how particular animals specifically adapted to a certain enviroment. Then, some of the questions were wrong, graphs were labled incorrectly or not labled at all in certain areas where they needed to be, questions were asked poorly. You've only got a limited amount of time to study for the SAT biology test, you don't want to waste all of your time and stress yourself out using this book because there are many books that are a lot better."
1,Awful editing in 2006 revised edition from BKP,"My one star is not a criticism of the author or content, but rather of the publisher. A. K. Warder's book is a classic and worth getting if you want to learn Pali, but stay far, far, away from the 2006 BKP edition (the one pictured). I have never come across a more poorly-edited textbook on any subject. Accents and diacritical marks appear and disappear randomly on the same word from one page to another, tables and footnotes are full of formatting errors, and the Pali text selections are rife with misspellings. I had to give up after the fifth chapter because it became too difficult to determine what was and was not a misprint."
3,"A welcome, but not essential, addition to any NIN collection","If you are buying this import, chances are good that you already have the LP version of ""March of the Pigs"" and are more interested in the other two tracks, so I'll get right to it:""reptilian"" is a decent remix of ""reptile""...not exactly earth shattering, but good as usual, with some cool delay and stereo effects at the end.""underneath the skin"" is another remix of ""reptile"", this time mostly instrumental. The quality is similar to ""reptilian"".. Good as usual, but not exceptional.Overall, I would say that this single is more for hardcore NIN fans and collectors looking to find all of Trent's tracks. Most casual NIN fans wouldn't find this one worth the money."
2,Sinking sub,"Submarine is one of those quirky and eccentric coming-of-age comedies in the vein of Rushmore. Unfortunately, it's too quirky and eccentric for its own good.Oliver Tate (Roberts) is a peculiar young man growing up in Wales. He finds himself with his first girlfriend, a peculiar firebug (Paige), while trying to save his peculiar parents' peculiarly sexless marriage.First time director Richard Ayoade, who also wrote the screenplay (based on the novel by Joe Dunthorne), is primarily known for his acting, having starred in one of the best comedy series in the last 20 years, The IT Crowd (a British show, available on DVD in the U.S., highly recommended). He tries to hard to emulate Wes Anderson, but falls short. Hell, sometimes even Anderson himself can be too ""Anderson-y"" (sic).The film is watchable, but ultimately forgettable."
5,What is happening to Danielle's brother?,"Fifteen-year-old Danielle, her parents, and her pesky nine-year-old brother Peter have just moved in to a creepy old house. Peter is so annoying that sometimes Danielle wishes she didn't have a brother. For example, when Danielle and her friend Addie are practicing pretended to be hypnotized for a school talent show, Peter insists on getting hypnotized, too. And after that, things start to get really weird. Peter is acting strange. He's forgetting things. Little things at first. But then big things. And strange voices are calling to him from the dark basement of the house. A mysterious guy in a long black coat is following Danielle around. What is causing Peter's amnesia? The mysterious guy? The hypnosis? Danielle's wish? The house itself? Read the book to find out! It's R. L. Stine's first new book in quite a while, and starts off a terrifying new series called The Nightmare Room."
5,Best book ever!!!,I really loved this book. R.L. Stine is my favorite author. A long time ago I was too scared to read them because I thought they would be too scary but I am so glad that I decided to give them a chance. R.L. Stine's way of writing really pull's you into right book.
2,The title is somewhat misleading.,"This is maybe a 4 Star book - IF, and ONLY if, this is the first book on Jack Welch and GE you have picked up. If you have already read ""Jack"" skip it. There is nothing here that hasn't already been said elsewhere. I was disappointed how little ""new"" information was presented in this book.If you are looking for something on the topic of controlling your own destiny this title is somewhat misleading."
4,Surprisingly good!,"Yes, it's yet ANOTHER Cher gits collection, but this one has some fun extras: namely the first three tracks, none of which were hits ... but are pretty great nonetheless (especially ""Oh No, Not My Baby""). Also, this CD's version of ""I Found Someone"" is a slightly different mix than the one released here in the States. Overall, a terrific CD, even though the #1 hit ""Half-Breed"" was not included (Was it not a hit in the UK, where this CD was released?). I whole-heartedly recommend this to Cher fans!"
4,Robert Collins continues UFO validation......with details.,"Author Robert Collins ""Exempt from Disclosure"" (2nd Edition) traces in detail the clandestine work behind UFO history, technology, and even direct communication with Alien beings. His ""sphere of Influence"" seems to include direct and indirect access to pivotal government and military figures that hint through memos, conversations, and experience that we are definately ""not alone"".Moreover, these details and colorful individuals are laid out chronologically, so as to allow the reader to understand the scope and sensitivity of the subject. These details outline energy devices, communique, and extraordinary claims of visitation that boggle the imagination, and if true, could change the way we look at religion, politics, and most importantly............ourselves!KUDOS Robert, what's next?TB"
2,Where's the beef?,"I don't understand all these glowing reviews. This book starts with a great premise, to make a case for the UFO cover up. Then, it doesn't deliver. What is exempt from disclosure? Approximately half the book is an rambling expose on supposed members of MJ-12, a project that many believe does not exist, as such, if at all. Then the second half is a collection of speculations about what may or may not be in the basement at Wright-Patterson and elsewhere. The only chapter that I found interesting was section III, ch 3, discussing how ""alien"" physics is not the same as ""our"" physics and why we have not been able to duplicate their propulsion system, material, etc. That alone would have made a great book. Yet the tidbits offered here only corroborate information already in the public domain by Bernhard Haisch, Pierre Geurin, and Wilbur Smith (see Good's Above Top Secret). But what's exempt about that?"
2,bracelet,The clasp broke the third time I wore it. I really loved the colors because you could wear it with so many things. I didn't feel like going through the whole return thing.
2,"Works fine, until it breaks...","This was my first rabbit vibrator, and I was excited about it. I just bought it in June, and for something with a cord, it worked just fine. However, I quickly found that the material was hard to wash and stuck to most anything, no matter how undesirable. I had to remove the batteries or turn them upside-down to keep the thing from running in my drawer when I wasn't using it. Then, to top it all off, the vibrating bullet died at the worst possible moment, which was a huge disappointment. Now I'm stuck with something I can't use, which was only actually good for the vibrating function.I was going to recommend it until this point--now I wish I had a way of getting my money back."
3,it's ok,"a month later & it still reeks of plastic.pretty weak in the vibrating department.the penis part is very wide, the rabbit ""fingers"" are very pokey/slightly sharp(i don't know many women who enjoy being poked on their clitoris). it's ok & gets the job done eventually. save up & buy a hitachi wand instead(you'll thank me later)."
1,ouchhh,"never order this item over the summer months, melts too quicks,post office way 2 slow......... price way to dam much for something u stick up your ass"
5,"The ""How-to-do-it"" Thelma and Louise guide","What can I say- after reading it- I dropped my kids off at my parents, called my husband, and talked my girlfriend into ""hitting the road"" with me! We had a blast! A great inspirational book to help you to remember those crazy ""raod sister"" days!"
1,"Yawn, what a let down","Well, somethings get worse with age, and so does Ms. Tuttle. This book was a major let down. I think a bad girl wannabe would get better advice from viewing all the Aerosmith videos."
3,good,I was very pleased with the short time it took to get this product. I was even pleased with the condition that the product was in. I would order from this person again.
2,Disappointing,"While their voices blend well, this Christmas album isn't that good. The Stylistics are down to 3 guys now & it shows."
4,"Her lover stole her kingdom, She took it back","An accurate account of Empress Matilda's fight to save England.Fickle barons, adulterous liaisons, battles for power, battles in the name of God, and misplaced loyalties saturate this segment of English history. As a writer I admire Dr. Garwood's ability to make the era spring to life while showing the delicate political maneuvers involved in restoring the throne to its rightful heir.Often women in history have been forgotten or masculinized. Dr. Garwood accurately revives Empress Matilda as strong and feminine. This twelfth century daughter of King Henry I handles affairs of the heart and affairs of state with panache."
1,doesnt fit 98 honda civic hatchback,this item did not fit my 98 honda civic hatchback perfectly and i wasted awhole day working on my car for nothing!
5,PULSZAR LEAVES YOU CRYING FOR MORE!,"I can hardly put into words what I felt like from the first listen of ""Nightmares"" by Pulszar. I learned of them from a person on an e-group that I am in. This person could not stop talking of this band. Finally I was intrigued, and wanted to hear them for myself. After asking more about the band, I purchased the CD. From the bass line, of the first track ""Don't Make Me"" I knew I would positively LOVE this band, and I DO. The disc is filled with beautiful music, and amazing lyrics and harmonies, that literally make you crave for more. If I had to compare them to another band, it would probably be Belly. There are many similarities, yet really this band stands alone. Some of my favorites on this album, if I had to name just a few would be: Don't Make Me, Hanging, and Can't Help. I can't wait for Pulszar to release a full length album, hopefully it will be soon. Pick up this CD though, YOU WON'T REGRET IT!!"
1,Still writing in his diary my ass,he didnt write none of this trash petey pablo shows no growth on this cd he took it from the south to somwhere near wacksvillethis is not of dirty south origin all his lyrics sound cool then he starts screamin and hoopin and hallaring about nuthing petey sounds like a cold drunk on this album i've listened to hip hop all my life i bought this disc and was very disapointed petey needs to lean back and go write sumden else i wouldnt download this album much less buy itmatter of fact you couldnt give me this album he still writing in his diary and im still not buying another anything with him on it ever again
1,What an Intelligent Person!,"Man, I tell you...this Petey Pablo cat is something creative. Have you seen his new video? The one with the half-naked girls and expensive cars? That was such a creative idea. It had never beebn done before in a rap video! And I love the way everyone else on this site agrees how cool the ""durty"" South style of rap is. It has to be cool! It's pronounced duuurty! Just kidding. Rap is a fad and it will die soon, and we'll have a new mainstream. And Petey Pablo isn't really creative. I was messin' with ya."
5,Christpher Hart's Best Book Ever!,"This book is simply the best book that Christopher Hart ever did make. Even though he was smacked in the face with a banana cream pie, he still wants us averages to know the secrets of anamation, and motion and action lines. Without this guy, we'd all be board. I wouldn't be reveiwing this book! I wouldn't be saying that I wouldn't be reivewing this book! Simply, this is a BEST SELLER! And it's a really great book!"
5,Tony's Masterpiece,Any fan of Tony Carey/Planet P should make it a point to add this disc to their collection. It is an excellent concept album and a great followup to the Planet P debut. Why MCA Usa has not released this cd in the states is both a tragedy and a disservice to Planet P fans. Sound quality is very clean but the booklet has no lyrics. A must-have.
4,Tony still goin' strong.,"Probably won't appeal to many, but I loved it! Needs to be played LOUD!! :-)"
5,If you like Pink Floyd... then you'll like Planet P Project,"The whole album is a story of a distant future where their ""savior"" is a boy who can't talk (Artemus). This boy saves the human race (well most of it), from a nuclear war.The music and lyrics are superb, and I am finally glad to see this album make its way into the digital age without the obnoxious DRM protection.Remember don't fuel the DRM Enemy, buy AmazonMP3, and help win the DRM war!"
5,The only thing that works for me...,"Ah the topic of constipation... not a fun subject. But I will say this... when I have trouble, i take two of the 100mg stool softer and it works like a charm the very next morning."
1,A Vapid Tale of an Ageing Soap Star,"If I were Hunter Tylo, I would be ashamed to admit that I act the way she says she does--drugs, drinking, fist fights with my husband, aldultery on both sides, and that's just for starters. This book paints a portrait of two very vapid, vain, self-centered, selfish and ageing actors who are struggling to come to terms with their last gasp at glory. All I can say after reading this trash is that I really feel sorry for the children of Hunter and Michael Tylo. No one should have to endure what these kids do."
4,I find it helpful!,"TracFone is great. No bills! You pay as you go! If you can't afford to put minutes on or pay a bill, no worries. You have time!"
5,Drumming Heaven,"I enjoy drumming music. This recording is one of my favorites in my collection. If you are into international drumming sounds, this is for you."
4,Very nice,This is a good sturdy cover I bought for a Charbroil TruInfrared patio grill. It fits great and has a nice long drawstring you can tie down for added security on very windy days. Easily wipes clean with a sponge and a little dish soap. A great value
1,Not So Good,"Have been trying different prepared Bernaise products, and this ranks close to the bottom. Overly lemon taste and very little teragon."
2,Packaging,"When I received the package the box was torn open and a pipe was hanging out of the box. I will not know if all the parts are there until I can get someone to assemble the system, I hope all the parts are there."
1,Lifetime 1221 Pro CourtBasketball System,It broke apart about a month later. It would not stand. We had to use cinderblocks to hold it up. We were ripped off.
5,Solid purchase,"I shopped online extensively before making this purchase. My son really wanted a basketball hoop that raises and lowers super easy- but those are EXPENSIVE and I am not even sure he will like shooting hoops next month so spending that kind of money was not an option! I am so glad we bought this net. For the money- AWESOME. It was super easy to put together (surprisingly my hubby did it by himself in about 2 hours) and my son is thrilled with it. Changing the height is not super easy, but it is definitely doable in a few minutes. For those not wanting to drop a lot of change for a hoop for a kid that is just going to knock around, this is a solid purchase."
3,Pain in the neck to put counter weight. sand.,I wish it was easier to pour wet sand in the bottom base. The hole was too small to send the sand in. It took hours to fill it. My daughter said it was not high enough even though I fixed it to the highest possible height.
4,The kids love it,"This backboard/basketball goal was a great Christmas present for the kids. Assembly was a nightmare. The directions were in Chinese characters, with pictures to refer to. However, I knew from other reviewers to expect the assembly to be complicated, so we weren't blind-sided that it was not going to be fun.Once assembled, though, it's been a ton of fun. I like the fact that the goal height is adjustable, so that our 7 year old can shoot baskets along with the teenagers. For the price, it's a very good product."
4,Lifetime Basketball System,"For the cost, this is a nice basketball goal. Assembly was fairly easy using basic 1/2"" wrench, pliers, screwdriver & (allen wrench's-included) Has it up an going in less than an hour. Putting in the sand is most tedious part--holes are very small and a funnel makes it harder. Just have to take your time--(use sand box sand)Overall a good product."
4,Excellent product/Pain in the @$$ to assemble.,"My godson and his friends really enjoy the assembled unit and it seems well made so five stars for that. Deduct at least one though (perhaps more depending on your patience level) for assembly. Ridiculously involved. Should it take over two hours to put together a pole, backstop and net? Yet it does.I thought it was just me but other reviews confirm the time consumed."
4,Good value,"I got this for my boyfriend for our anniversary and he loves it. It's not super-strong but it's great for regular play, nothing too crazy."
2,Undecided on this item!,"I was a little worried about the quality of this product due to it's cheap price. It shipped very quickly and the boxed arrived intact. I unpacked everything and pre-arranged all the pieces and hardware. Low and behold I was missing one specific piece. If it would have been a normal washer or bolt I wouldn't have had any problems finding one. But it wasn't. I had to call the company to have them ship another one.This was a Christmas gift for my son, and now it's sitting in the garage waiting for the dome shaped recessed washer to arrive. Depending on how long that takes, I may or may not update this review."
4,Better than I thought,"I read reviews before placing the order. Although the overall reviews were good, I was somewhat concerned about the complaints on assembly. I got it yesterday (via free FedEx ground) and it was better than I thought. Yes the assembly manual could have been written better, but I thought it was an average quality manual for the price we pay for. It took about an hour for my son (7 years old) and I finished the assembly. I'd say the quality of the materials (poles, backboard, etc.) was pretty good for the price. My son and I tried different heights and finally set it for 8 feet for now. It's a good basketball hoop for kids (maybe under 12) and I'd recommend it for kids."
2,Read it for what it is,"This book is interesting to read. But if you think the death and resurrection of the beloved son refers to that of Jesus, you'll have to read it carefully to find out what this book is about. This book is all about making far-fetched connections between various stories, in the Old Testament or pagan literature, to show that the story of Jesus is merely one more among many (like the Binding of Isaac), the distinctiveness of which is not to be ""overstated"". This book is full of self contradictions, poor exegeses, heavy dependence on rabbinic interpretive traditions, all geared towards showing Christianity to be an unworthy competitor to rabbinic Judaism."
2,Camp Fantasy,"Some people will like this book, which is mercifully only 110 pages, but the ""camp fantasy"" genre is weakly executed. Reminiscent of Ronald Firbank's 'Sorrow in Sunlight' (which has a very politically incorrect title in the USA which if used has rejected my previous submissions), I am Elijah Thrush is like a sickly sweet sherry. The character Millicent de Frayn occasionally raised a smile and her lust for men was amusing but the fantasy overall failed to ignite interest or generate mental connection. On the evidence of this novella, it is difficult to understand why James Purdy has inspired a following of any kind especially literary."
2,eh...,"I admit, I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 so I wouldn't appear too harsh... I am disappointed in this book, after reading a synopsis of what seemed like it would be an interesting story line and seeing all the good reviews. Like some other reviewers in the minority, I think the writing is bland and stilted, and the characters are uncompelling, leaving me bored, not invested and annoyed with them (especially Dorothea - GAG). In fact, several times this summer I have gratefully put the book away to move on to a new buy -- only to have to pick it up again when I've run out of other things to read. My latest stint with the book has put me within 20 pages of the end, but I don't think I can make myself finish it -- it's just not worth it, in my opinion. I haven't read Lisa Tucker's other books, so perhaps her style of writing just doesn't suit my tastes."
4,This is an excellent story!,"I really loved this book and read it in a very short amount of time. I couldn't put this book down. I would have given it 5 stars expect for the fact that there were parts that seemed unnecessary to me. I just skimmed past those parts.I've never been part of one, but I think that this story would give a book club a lot to talk about. Something I was left thinking about after this book ended was perhaps the children turned out better then they would have, had the father not kidnapped them (even though I feel it was a TERRIBLE thing for him to do)."
2,Not what I expected,"I heard about this book through a women's book club and noted the 5-star ranking on these reviews. Once I got into the book, I was surprised by the very graphic account of an assault against one of the female characters. Though the event itself was crucial to the plot, I thought the horrific detail was gratuitous, as well as highly upsetting, and I would think twice before recommending this book to another woman. The story was engaging and kept me reading, but I was disappointed by the lack of depth in the two main female characters. They ""rise above"" profoundly disturbing experiences rather than confronting them head on, and the ending of the novel is too ""neat."""
4,More Than Mediocre,"I feel like I use the words heartfelt and touching a lot when I am describing books, but really, that's what this book is. Heartfelt. And touching. It was also really cool; Lisa Tucker came up with an amazingly interesting way to have the past meet the present without involving things like time machines or black holes (not that I have anything against either of those things in a book). The plot is right on, the characters are well-developed and absorbing, there is just the right amount of drama, and the writing style is easy to follow and to the point.I wouldn't go so far as to say that ""Once Upon a Day"" is riveting, but it is gripping and amusing, hooking the reader from chapter 1 and keeping them wanting more.This book is more than mediocre, more than good, but less than spectacular. There's something that's missing, some reason that I didn't love love LOVE it, but I can't seem to articulate exactly what that missing thing is."
3,Compelling,"The plot is compelling, the story moves right along and the characters are likeable if not always totally believable. The reader is drawn in and held fast by the skillful storytelling - though I was left feeling a teeny bit manipulated when the characters sometimes acted in improbable ways to advance the story. It bears some resemblance to The Memory Keeper's Daughter, in that it concerns the effects a disastrous decision by one family member has on the rest of the family."
3,Skimpy on Details,Covers too much in too little pages - but essentially still a great travel guide for first timers!!
1,Junk!,"This item is the biggest piece of junk I have ever ordered from Amazon. It never worked from day one. It filled with water as soon as it rained. The arm holding the light just plain broke off. It's garbage. What's more, you can't even call or write Amazon to complain about it. At least I haven't found a way. For $37.00 it's not worth my time or effort to go through Amazon's tedious return policy."
2,Basketball return,This thing didn't last. It broke after a few weeks of play. They need to make it out of a harder plastic.
2,"Great title, slow book","A very interesting book all the way to page 2. The next 320 pages really drag on. I read a lot of travel books. The premise of this trip was interesting, but the writing did not hold my interest. On the first few pages the author outlines his criteria for a north to south trip through western North America, travelling by bus and train, and he provides a rough map of his route. The rest of the book is mostly recreated dialog with other passengers and local residents. There is some area history and interesting anecdotes, but much of the detail adds little or nothing to the story and could have been edited out. I started skimming pages about a quarter way into the book, and gave up entirely about halfway through."
4,Easy to read,"This book is written in a easy way to read, entertaining and informative in some parts but the writer was misinformed in some other parts. I am an Egyptian and while was reading some parts I was feeling like she was talking about another country than the one I know. Either she was misinformed as I said or didn't understand some aspects of the culture. Overall, it is a good book. At least she took the time to know another culture. I salute her."
1,don't count on this tire gauge lasting very long,"I owned this item, and it died within about a year with only minor use -- maybe once every two months. The battery can't be replaced. What a waste of money."
4,Another Dawn,"This was a wonderful sequel to Sunset Embrace. However, ifanyone doesn't want to know the ending, STOP reading these reviewsright now because they ruined it for me by talking about it.I'd like to see Ms. Brown continue the story with a book about Lee."
3,"Good protection, slips a little","The Bunga heel/achilles protector footless sock is an overall good product. On bare feet, it feels a little thin and loose, but over a pair of tights or socks, it does not slip around. The gel pad is also thin, which can be good if your boots/shoes are tight. But if your shoes/boots are too large (and that is the reason that you are buying them), these will be too thin to help you much."
4,Good Product,I have liked the product. I have a spur on the back of my heal and this has provided a lot of relief. I would recommend this product.
3,Good Book,This secular and obviously slanted account of how the Irish monastic movement saved many Latin works is an amazing testimony of God's providence. It chronicles the life and work of St. Patrick and the resulting renaissance in Ireland as the rest of Europe entered the Dark Ages.
3,Sloppy/disorganized book with much interesting trivia.,"This is a very interesting book. Unfortunately, the connection between the title of the book and the content of 90% of the book is very tenuous. Indeed, the discussion about the ""save civilization"" piece was almost perfunctory, at the end of the volume. That said, there are alot of interesting facts about early-Irish history, early-Catholic Church history, St Patrick, etc."
5,More than just history - a work of love.,"To read Cahill's account of the the Irish conversion to Christianity and the saving of early manuscripts through the darkest ages of European history is to gain a new understanding of the soul of the Irish people. Inspired by Cahill's writing in How the Irish Saved Civilization, we went on to write The Galway Chronicles which further explores the oppression of the Irish by the English from the protestant conquests of Queen Elizabeth to the massacres of Cromwell and the famines of the 1840s. How tragic that the great Irish intellectuals and spiritual leaders which Cahill writes about could later be reduced to such desperation, ignorance and poverty by the brutal politics of English conquerors. Cahill captures the beauty and intellectual prowess of the Irish as they were when the world beyond was locked in ignorance, brutality and spiritual darkness. How the Irish Saved Civilization is a must for every bookshelf!"
3,Irish Literary and Religious History,"I found the content of this book nowhere near as profound as the title. At times the writing was dry and listless, but I found the history of St. Patrick interesting. All in all, an OK book."
5,I could not put it down.,"This wonderful little book is a tour de force of men and women with lives of romance and adventure, tragedy and faith. My knowledge of the dark ages is abysmal. My interest in Saints Augustine and Patrick is minimal at best. Yet this little book was a wonderful read, very difficult to put down"
5,Chalk one up to the Irish,"Thomas Cahill's ""How the Irish Saved Civilization..."" is the kind of written history that was born in the oral tradition. This is a book not only scholarly in content, but eminently readable by all. Certainly, it has become a monument to the Irish monks who one can see painstakingly copying the ancient books of the Greeks for posterity. Cahill's recounting of Patrick, Ireland's patron saint, brings this Roman slave's life to the people without compromising his inherent holiness. Thomas Cahill does great honor to his ancestors with his book, a must read for anyone interested in the history of Western Civilization."
2,"If you buy it for Liam, you may be a wee disappointed.","I will admit that the only reason I bought this was to hear Liam Neeson in my car. I LOVE him and got this because it's the only audio book I can find with him narrating. Well, I can't focus on the information long, or even Lovely Liam's amazing voice, because it's very monotone. Very quiet. No inflection. Now, being Liam's most avid fan (and future love interest, I hope) I think he has gotten better and better with age. This is pretty old and I don't think he would read it so monotone now, if he even recorded it now. But since it's my only audio of him, I keep it in my car and enjoy him all the way around town. If anyone knows of another audio by him, let me know."
3,Not so Civilized,Cahill bemoans the fact that Catholics have been given a bum rap and yet he doesn't think a second about slamming the Mormon and Islam religion. He has the ability to breathe life into history but it's not worth much if he can't set aside his own biases. What a shame.
2,Unremarkable,"If you already know that the Irish ""saved civilization"" through its monastic tradition, you are probably not going to learn much more through this book. Instead of telling us what is actually going on during the period, the author spends WAY too much time quoting select passages of from ancient Irish literature and then making generalizations about the Irish character from those passages. I could probably read the same books and pull passages that support the oppostite conclusions. The fact that the Irish literature from that period only represents a tiny fraction of the population makes this exercise all the more pointless. I could not find a mention of a single saved work of literature can be directly attributed to the Irish"
2,Could have been better,"I have heard from several colleagues that Cahill's book was a triumph of historical research and argument. While he explains why he thinks the Irish saved civilization, he does not make his point convincingly for the book to live up to the hype. He does also neglect to include factors such as the Muslim presence and their efforts to protect important artifacts of the time in addition to the efforts of the Irish. Cahill's bias is another factor impacting the effectiveness of the thesis. He is obviously pro Irish and tends to go on tangents which do little if anything to support his thesis. Maybe the primary source documents are not as readily available to perform proper research, but it seems his thesis is supposition with little support. Very informative, but does not hit a home run in arguing his points."
4,"Not Perfect, but Entertaining","As a person of Irish heritage, the title of this book naturally caught my attention. What follows was, for me, a highly entertaining and well-written manuscript about the role of Irish monks in the preservation of western learning after the fall of the Roman Empire, the subsequent dissemination of it. It's not a perfect book; as others have noted, it is silent on the role that other cultures played in preserving and disseminating ancient learning. However, it kept me interested and kept me turning the pages. I would recommend it to any casual student of history."
3,"Irish, Europe and Culture","The book was recommended to me by a friend who knows about my interest in Philosophy and European culture. It is a brief book that gives to the point information about fall of Roman Empire, rise of Christianity in Europe and insight about Irish culture of the time. Interesting Irish folktales, traditions and mentality have certainly influenced the was that Irish, in their own way ave saved European civilization. Good read, but more interested reader would want to know more..."
4,A Great Book For The Summer,"This book tells of the trials and tribulations that a shy, overweight girl must endure when she is sent to summer camp for the first time. The humiliation of having a Bathing Beauty contest and a Bathing Ugly contest for the prettiest and ugliest campers is described and the feelings of the female protagonist are explored. It's an ideal book for those who may be going away to summer camp this year or for anyone who may need help in being compassionate towards those who aren't rail thin, bathing beauties."
4,Not as bad as the other reviews make it sound,"When I first bought this item I was really scared because of all the bad reviews that it got on this site. I decided to get it anyway and let me just say it serves its purpose, works well in my car and on other radios, it looks great and matches the ipod really well. The two different modes work well and the dial on the side makes for easy station selecting which is a nice change from having to have to songs on your ipod. So if you are planning on buying and itrip for your ipod don't worry about these negative reviews it works well."
2,iTrip,The unit didn't work. Had to return. The product that I got in return works great. Not happy that I got an item deliverd that didn't work.
1,This thing doesnt work,"This thing works horrable! It kills the ipod battery so fast when it does work, which isnt often. Most of the time it is staticy and it is so hard just to get it to turn on. I am in the process of returning it."
4,Mostly Satisfied,"So after looking around for a few weeks I decided on this product. When it cam I tried it out in my car, and I think it worked pretty well. The only thing to note is that you need to constantly update the station because as you move into other areas you get signals from other stations and it gets a good amount of static. It can be frustrating trying to find a good station in a city with many stations. One thing I really liked about it though was that it has a USB 2.0 Mini B port, so I can use the same charger that I use for my Motorolla cell phone."
2,NOT REALLY WORTH IT,I bought this thing for my video ipod and when i put it on it didnt work the signal sucks as u can see they are selling it from 2.49cents! DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY!
3,Pros and Cons.,"Ergonomics are simple, and well designed. The side button pushes up or down like a toggle switch, and pressing the dial in toward the unit allow you to change between dx and lx modes in efforts to improve reception or sound quality respectively.Its actual performance however, is average, as I found that in many places it is difficult to find a decent clear radio station. I am not sure if it is the unit, or if it is just my particular unit as I purchased it used even though it claimed to be new. It seems to have a steady performance though, as near my house for example and particularly in my driveway, I can't get any signal, and then its extremely clear when I am about 30 yards away.If you can deal with a few spots of ""white noise"", I recommend it for an easy wireless solution. Wired decks or units will always be better though. Ease of use is its compromise."
1,Awful,"Horrible sound quality. If you have to buy a FM transmitter get one that plugs in to you cigarette lighter, they are much better even though they do cost more."
3,"Works ok, good design for the price","This product works okay at getting your ipod through the FM radio. Some static seems to be present at all times. A direct link is better, but if that's not an option, this will work. Nice, compact design from one of the accessory originators-- Griffin."
1,Weak signal,"I bought this item for my 5.5G iPod, since I have another, older iTrip (the one that plugs into the top of the iPod for the 4G iPod) that works great with my older iPod.This item was such a disappointment that after several attempts to find a good use for it I have decided I will have to abandon it to a desk drawer. I was unable to get even mediocre quality in my car, and I thought that perhaps I could still use it at home with a radio in lieu of using my mp3 cable. I was wrong. I could not get a good signal with it even when putting my iPod in close proximity to a desktop radio.Even if you could get it for just a few bucks, like I did, please be careful before you buy. Other products out there are expensive, but hopefully they will work better! At first, I thought that perhaps my unit was defective, since i bought it used, but then I saw here that even someone who bought a new one from the store had the same problem as I did."
4,Review on 9781-TRP30BK iTrip FM Transmitter with LCD and Dock Connector for iPod,"Recently purchased this item to go with the newest generation iPod Nano. We tried it cross-country from North Carolina to California. It works very well with a very good sound quality that suffers a bit more near cities. Out in the country, we couln't believe how well it works sometimes sounding better than a radio station. I would highly recommend it. It is a an inexpensive alternative to the costlier iPod car adaptors sold at dealerships, etc."
1,Save your $ and your time,"Would not recommend this product. Tested this product on several different cars. The sound quality is poor, scratchy, and the signal is lost every 5-15 seconds - before you ask, had the same user experience on several FM frequencies. Also, I attempted various locations w/in the car, all w/ the same result. Good idea, bad product experience. Save your $ and your time."
3,About as good as FM,"Are you going to get crystal clear reception? No. This device comes in about as good a college radio station while driving. There is some fuzz, but not terrible. The really bad thing... I live in NJ so the airways are pretty conjested, so a ""blank"" station may be good for only a few miles before it is a ""real"" radio staton and I have to change the frequency."
5,Another well made product by Sony,"Well, considering this is a discontinued item I won't go in to great detail. Sony products may be a little more expensive than comparable items but you can always count on them to work well and this camcorder is no exception. Have owned it for 4 years with absolutely no problems and still use it."
1,Disapointed,Only used a few times before started not working. Keeps saying reinsert tape. If I take the battery off for a few minuets it works some times but never know when or for how long!
5,Best way to shave,"I bought this because many websites say it is far superior to using aerosol shaving cream, and they were right. Better fragrance than col. Conk and it has a refreshing tingle, what a great way to start the day!"
3,This is NOT a cream... more of a soap.,"I got the first container and was disappointed to see that the soap (that should be creamy) was actually very hard. I returned it thinking it defective.I ordered another unit and that came in the same exact way. You have to take a chunk out of it to use it. It's more of a soap than a cream. It was very difficult to get it lathered up since you have to get the chunk to melt.The soap itself is good. Very cooling. A good summertime soap. Not sure if the mfg. has made this soap hard on purpose but I don't care for it this way. I have not found any other ""complaints"" about the hardness on the Internet which leads me to believe this is not supposed to be this way.Update: I have since learned that this is the normal way this soap is. It is NOT a cream so don't be fooled by the package."
2,I think that they changed their formula,"I settled on Omega as my favorite shaving cream about a year ago, but it appears that they either changed their formula in the past few months or perhaps I received a bad batch. Since they also changed their container shape over the same interval, I'm willing to bet it's a formula change.The new formula is very oily and has the consistency/look of sour cream. It doesn't hold on to the brush well and creates a very thin foam."
3,Smells like comet cleanser.. really.,"It's a quality item and does the job, but the fragranceused is the same used by the toilet/tube scour cleanerCOMET.It's a great item but it (probably unknowingly to the mfg)has the same fragrance as a known U.S. brand of toiletand tub cleaner..Unless you cherish smelling like toilet cleanerall day, I would get the other version or proraso."
1,Not the same product as before!,"The older version of the omega shaving cream was amazing! The past 2 times I have ordered I have received a different omega shaving cream, the container is a different shape and the new shaving cream is horrible! Do not purchase this new omega shaving cream, it is the worst. It took amazon over 6 months to add a new picture of the ""new omega shaving cream."" Stay away, please bring back the old omega shaving cream amazon!!!"
5,If You Wet Shave,"Gotta love those Italians! When it comes to shaving soap, they have the edge. I, like a small number of Americans wet shave. That is where you use a shaving soap and brush to moisten your whiskers prior to shaving. In doing so, I have tried several different kinds of shaving soaps searching for the perfect one that allows me to obtain a close shave where it is impossible to feel a whisker after the shave. Only one shaving soap to date has allowed me this luxury and that is Omega. I don't know their secret but suspect the oils used hold some clues. I do know I have a supply of it to last me for the next few years. That is how much I like it."
3,FYI... wrong images presented,"The first two images shown for this listing are INCORRECT. This listing is for the 2-on-1 CD on the U.K. EDSEL label, not the German LINE label. While the content of the two discs are the same, technically they are different products. The images by ""Zub"" are the correct ones for this product with this UPC."
5,Great import-only CD EP,Tracklisting:Ashes To AshesThe Big KahunaMouth To MouthAshes To Ashes (Hardknox Alternative Mix)
1,Little knowledge is dangerous,"The saying goes ""little knowledge is dangerous"" but pankrust fits ""the cancer"". In Ethiopia, it is traditional to represent the wealthiest, the creative, the most resourceful and the developed as ""backwards"". While the good liars are considered ""civilized"". Peole get confused where to label foreigner liars like pankrest. If you have not gotten yet what I am saying, visit southern central as well as northern Ethiopia, talk to the people and ask your opinion about the cancer. They will all tell you what pankrest is"
5,"If you like pop/rock ballads, this is a must-have","There is currently a lack of ballads in the music industry. This album is going to fill that gap for you. Every song has great production (instruments and vocals). #1 and #18 are new songs, along with #16, #17 and #19 on the Bonus CD. Here's my rating of the songs:1. A Thing About You ***2. It Must Have Been Love ****3. Listen To Your Heart ****4. Fading Like A Flower ****5. Spending My Time ****6. Queen Of Rain **7. Almost Unreal ***8. Crash Boom Bang ***9. Vulnerable **10. You Dont Understand Me ***11. Wish I Could Fly ****12. Anyone ***13. Salvation ***14. Milk & Toast & Honey ***15. Breathe ***16. The Weight Of The World (Bonus CD) **17. It Hurts (Bonus CD) ***18. See Me (Bonus CD) **19. Every Day (Bonus CD) ***This is such a wonderful album. It's a perfect gift for the xmas holidays and Valentines Day. In fact, I have plans to buy it for 3 of my friends as xmas presents."
3,No Red Eye,I would not buy this camera again. It has red eye correction I guess for after you take a photo but there is no red eye second flash like on my previous camera. The picture color is not accurate and most of the photos do not come out clear. I would try another brand or model.
4,More than I expected,"While the SD750 was not one of the latest models from Canon, it has more than solved my desire for a compact digital camera. I find that I use it all the time instead of carrying my S-1. The large 3.0 inch screen, on-screen display of ISO,flash,shooting mode was an unexpected plus. The only negative feature is the proprietary battery which is required to accommodate the small camera size. I simply purchased an extra and keep it charged, just in case. It would be nice if Canon could develop a ""quick look"" menu button for battery status. This is my 5th Canon digital on top of two previous analog APS units. I love Canon quality."
2,"Great at first, but then...","I absolutely loved my camera at first, but then, like other reviews, I was cursed with the black screen of death. The camera was on, the lens was out, but the screen was completely black. When I attempted to take pictures despite the black screen, they didn't turn out. Nothing seemed to fix this problem. I do have the warranty, but again, you have to pay to have this repaired. The worst part about this is that the screen decided to go black while on my trip to NYC and I had to buy disposable cameras instead. Don't let this happen to you!"
1,I don't trust this brand,"The quality of the pictures were great. But then, after 13 months, the camera became dead. Battery is ok. But, for whatever reason, camera is dead. It feels like the camera is programmed to die after the warranty is over so that you will have to buy another camera."
2,Excited but then frustrated,"When I got my Canon SD750, I was so excited! I LOVED IT!! But then after 2 weeks, something went wrong. The screen randomly went black. The display worked, it would take a picture but come out black when reviewed. I tried to look for solutions on the internet but came up with nothing except a lot of similar complaints from a lot of other customers. They tried to get it fixed with the Canon warranty but was told to pay a fee. WTF? I charged the battery and it worked for a second then went black again. So I'm just gonna go back and return it for another brand. I really loved all of my pictures..."
5,Excellent quality for the price,"Love this camera, it's affordable, takes great photos, its thin and small enough, with the biggest LCD screen!I am very happy with my purchase."
1,good photos when it TURNS ON!,what use is good optics if the system is so crappy that it wont even turn on!no diagnosticstypical japanese crapbattery doesnt last 2 daysand cost fortune for spare battery!
3,Camera great - buying experience poor,Everything went fine with this purchase...the seller got me the camera quickly and I like the Camera.However Amazon told me that this item qualified for free shipping and then did not let me select a free shipping method. Bad on Amazon!
3,"A good effort on a modest budget (and filmed in Montreal, to boot!) with likable and dislikable characters...","Canadian cutie Susan Almgren, Mike Ironside(finally we see him in a good guy role) andvet Dave Carradine (what little we see of him!)come off best in this modest budgeted Cops andCrooks drama-actioner. Drug Dealer Carlos has aheap of stash stored in a drawer in his swankieapartment he shares with escaped mental patientAlmgren, who is addicted to Men(,of all things).He doesn't know of here past which Ironside andCarradine uncover. Lots of decent plot twistsand Ironside steals the show (not always thecase with leads in this kind of film). The restof supporting cast is fine as well. Sort of likethe Carradine / Nick Corri / Madeline Stowe filmTropical Snow, only this time Carradine is PoliceLt.! See it, enjoy it (there is some pretty goodhumour shown by Irondside and his two partners)and don't take it too seriously!"
5,A valuable book,"A very informative and well written book by some one who is obviously an authority on the subject. A good aspect of this book is to intorduce the reader to the notion of ""Islamic science"" rather than ""Arab science"" which is used by some semi schoalrs. The term ""Islamic scinece""is significant since it indicates the input and contribution of many cultures, Arab and non Arab into the body of sicentific knowledge created in Islamic civilization. It also is an indication of how, contrary to common misconceptions, Islamic religion brought together a vast number of people from different cultures and background and created an environment of harmony and spiritual awareness which led to many great philosophical and scientific works. As a moslem philosopher once said "" The dark ages for moslem nations started when moslems lost connection with the essence of their religion and spirituality""."
3,A learning process!,"I bought this for use in the Built-in Vacuum business where we go into homes being built and homes that are built to make bids and to install vacuum systems. To begin with the unit switches from Feet to Meters on it's own & the only way I found to change it back to feet was to remove & reinstall the battery, also it is necessary to take a flat, hard object to place in the target area or you get an error message on the screen, when it does work correctly I found it to be fairly accurate."
4,"Great ""Best Of"" Album","The album is less focused on the latest movie, so much as it is a ""greatest hits"" album of all of the Rocky movie soundtracks. All of the great songs are here (Living in America, Eye of the Tiger, Burning Heart, Hearts on Fire, the Rocky Theme, etc.) I love it and it just makes me love the old movies even more. The 3 6 Mafia track stuck out like a sore thumb and should have been left off, as it is a weak track anyway."
4,gonna fly now,"It has all the cinematic emotion that made the movies great. If you like rocky this album will take you through all the ups and downs he went though,all the classic them music is there and then some."
2,"Better off buying ""THE ROCKY STORY"" (CD)","This is pretty much the same as ""the rocky story"" (cd), i was very upset with this soundtrack...is it an official rocky VI soundtrack, maybee not, anyway it should of had more songs from the rocky balboa movie such as frank sinatra ""high hopes""...when rocky walks into the ring...or perhaps they didn't have the copyright, but they sure had the approval to play it in the film.....AND OTHER SONGS FROM ROCKY BALBOA (rocky VI) WHICH WERE PLAYED IN THE MOVIE WERE NOT ON CD."
5,Good Buy,Its exactly like the one I picked up in Maui. Beautiful representation of the Polynesian culture. Its a good buy
4,Goth feminist fantasy,Women writers keeping it real. Seventeen Goth Short Stories that inject modern lifestyles with supernatural myth to gloriously gory effect.
5,Excellent reference book on pigeons,"Illustrated with over 800 photographs and nearly 800 pages long, this hard cover book is one of the finest ever printed on pigeons. Also has chapters on care, color breeding, and history with humans. A must for every pigeon owner's library."
2,Not Burroughs' best.,"This book is the worst of all the Burroughs books I have read. It is beyond reproach that African Americans are portrayed as total morons as Hollywood portrayed them when the Borroughs wrote the book. It is however reprehensible to think about all the anti-semetic slurs in the book. It will probably be argued that like in Shakespere's time, he had to portray Jews as villains, but this book was written in the 1920's. Anyone could have been the villain but Burroughs goes out of his way to remind the reader of the villains ethnicity by saying basically, this is what to expect of Jews. Did Burroughs ever know any blacks or Jews? If he did, he certainly would not have portrayed them this way. It was not published during his lifetime probably for this reason. Why publish it now? For a fast buck."
5,Very Nice Book! Very Touching!,This is a great book to read in any language. It is sweet and gentle and kids will love it. The story is about a frog that sees what other animals can do and puts down all that he can do until... He learns to apprecate it! I bought the bilingual version in Turkish/English so I could share it with my Turkish students.
1,BUYER BEWARE!!!!,"Apparently this pump works for SOME people but it doesn't work for everyone- it cetainly didn't work for me. I was never able to pump a single drop! When I contacted Avent, they refused to offer a refund or an exchange for another Avent product. $50 down the drain-- plus I had to buy another pump (which worked fine). Avent doesn't stand behind their product. I wish I'd known this before I wasted my money."
2,Don't even waste your time!,"I was incredibly disappointed with this pump! The Ameda hand pump that they gave me at the hospital worked MUCH faster!After one use of the Isis pump, it lost suction, I re-read the manual and even replaced parts with the spares it came with, nothing!It is absolutely not a time-saver. I though that I would try it and see if it did work as fast as it claimed and if it didn't, I hadn't lost that much money and would then buy an electric pump. Well, it didn't work and I ended up buying an electric pump. Also, with the Isis, you can only pump one breast at a time and with an electric you can do both or only one. It only takes me 6 minutes with an electric pump.I wasted my money, don't waste yours."
3,"loud, slow machine","I have the 962 version of this all in one machine. It worked well for about one year, then a line developed down the middle of the page when faxing. Machine has daily moderate home business use. The print function is loud and slow. I bought it to replace my HP printer, which was far nicer. I thought I would try this one because it was $100 less than a replacement HP. I am now tossing it for a cannon."
3,Good Printer,"I've had this printer over a year now. I'ts noisy and photo quality is not that good but, It makes great looking copys and prints text perfect. I dont print photos because its cheaper to use an online service ie.kodak or CVS. overall I like this printer, it never broke down, I keep it on all day everyday and its easy to use."
1,not funny anymore - had to get rid of it,I almost hate to donate it because it is such an embarrassment with a Dell name on it. We love our PCs but hate this machine. I have wasted so much time trying to get a doc to scan or fax. Copy is the only thing that works. already had one replacement from Dell and no improvement. Decided it was enough when customers called more than once to have pages faxed again. Not fitting for a professional image - Dells or mine!
5,Deeply Emotional!,"This is a CD that effortlessly imbues the listener in a tide of emotional chords that replicate and haromize, surrounding the listener in music that beckons to be felt as much as listened. The songs sound similar to each other but only enough to create continuity and theme, and not enough to become boring and redundant. Definitely a good pick-up for anyone seeking a inspiring, relaxing and emotional music."
5,Southwestern Sterling-Gold Cross Necklace,The cross is beautiful! I bought it as a gift for my husband and he loves it.The cross arrived in a blue jewelry box. Inside the box was a pretty jewelry pouch for storing the cross. This was a nice surprise.We were impressed by the quality of the cross. It is well made and very detailed. Also included was a card with information about the meaning of the cross.I would buy from this seller again.
4,Burke's back,"After a couple of disappointing books Andrew Vachss redeems himself. Do yourself a favor and start with this series at the beginning. Great characters, satisfying endings."
3,Who even knows if this stuff works?,"I mean, they tell you that you have to do it. Oh no, you can't use Vinegar because it will strip the inside of our fancy machines, noooo, you have to buy this stuff that costs $15 for 2 tiny little bottles. Then it will decalcify your machine. I don't know, I just do it because I am a mindless drone I guess. I guess it worked? The water was darker and cloudier (but then, so was the liquid I put in it, wait...).Anyway, if you are fond of throwing your money away on nonsensical espresso maintenance items, then may I highly recommend the Durgol Swiss Espresso SPECIAL Decalcifier!"
1,Terrible product!,"I bought a package of 2 bottles of Durgol espresso machine decalcifier, followed directions in the instruction book exactly, running one bottle with 12 oz of water through my SAECO machine. Then I washed the water tank, refilled it with cold water to run it through the machine, and no water will come out, even though the machine is on and making the buzzing sound it does when making espresso. I think the decalcifier has ruined my espresso machine!"
4,Three great movies for the price of two,"First of all, I can't say enough about the classic There's Something About Mary, which is a must have for any movie collection.Shallow Hal was surprisingly well done, and performs well as a ""feel-good"" movie about a guy who has no respect for women and quickly develops himself into a more caring individual.The Girl Next Door is probably the best piece of this collection, and well worth the full price itself. Elisha Cuthbert is stunning, as usual, and the supporting cast is very funny, especially given the premise of this movie. Timothy Olyphant also gives this film a nice edge as the pimp that doesn't take any trash from anybody."
5,"History of the beliefs, rituals and culture of Santeria","Santeria is a growing religion in America with Caribbean origins, and Miguel De La Torre offers an informed and informative history of the beliefs, rituals and culture of Santeria in Santeria: The Beliefs And Rituals Of A Growing Religion In America. Santeria's Afro-Cuban roots are traced to cultural clashes, with its evolving spiritual roots receiving close explanation by an author who was reared in Santeria and clearly provides a basic understanding of its myths, rituals, and its modern role in both Latin and American communities today."
2,"not great, especially compared to other options","this was my first korean textbook and in hindsight there were much better options. i highly recommend books by the korean universities, anyone of them."
2,Completely biased and unuseful PAMPHLET,"This book is meant as an ego stroker for those who think that everything post-Vatican II was a disgrace and sham. The author does nothing but inflate his biased position while uneffectively attempting to denegrate not only the likes of Bugnini, but of all of the Council Fathers. It is no wonder this book is a Tan publication - I wish they would find their Christianity (ie. kindness and truth) before attempting to call themselves Catholic."
2,so-so with occasional flashes of light,"van cleave starts off on the right foot, but by mid-book, i'm terribly bored, and ultimately don't care. some moment of true clarity abound, and some are even rather clever and funny. say hello to some okay sounds, metaphor, but i want to say goodbye to the author's trying to exoticize the Other. a good 1st section. yes, very good."
2,Good luck trying to assemble this yourself,"This may be a good portable basketball system worthy of the 4 star reviews, but I don't know yet because after two days of assembly with three different people, I still can't get it put together!! Horrible assembly manual!!The instructions don't just need work, they need to be thrown out and re-written. The illustrations are of little if any help, most of the time they are more confusing than helpful. Seriously, if you have any second thoughts about having the skill and patience to assemble this -- and some serious tools, including a strong power drill -- do yourself a favor and go to a sporting goods store and have them assemble it for you. My kids been waiting for days for daddy to get his basketball hoop working, and it's still lying in pieces in the garage. Ugh, this has been a horrible experience."
3,IT'S NOT BAD...,"MY BROTHER BOUGHT THIS ALBUM LAST WEEK, AND I WAS LISTENING TO IT TODAY, AND HONESTLY IT'S NOT THAT BAD...I REMEBER WHEN MS. TEE WAS ON ""CASH MONEY RECORDS"", I THINK SHE WAS BETTER BACK THEN FOR SOME REASON, BUT U SHOULD CHECK THIS ALBUM OUT, I DOUBT THAT YOU'LL BE DISAPOINTED..I KNOW I'M NOT ! BUT THE BEATS COULD HAVE BEEN A LITTLE BETTER, SHE APPEARED ON SOME OF THE EARLY CASH MONEY ALBUMS (BEFORE THE BLEW UP) ! BUT PICK IT UP, I WAS SURPRISED THAT THIS ALBUM SOLD ...ON AMAZON.COM ! GO MS. TEE ! ANYWAYS, PICK IT UP !"
4,Very original and good,"A survivor of a massacre where over 200 US and Nazi troops were killed inside the Ardennes Forest and its secret cave wakes up in a psychiatric institution and begins to tell a tale about what really happened there on Christmas Eve in 1944. He wild tale describes how both troops came to fight an ancient evil, which was released from its prison after being sealed there for many centuries. Original, great, scary."
3,The Ardennes Tapes : Pray That Somebody Listens,this book was stimulating and kept me involved i thought it was well done and a typical tim benford style of facts and creative writing this is must read book
5,A definite page-turner!,Tim Benford's latest book proves that this writer knows how to grab an audience and hold its attention.
5,Paper Quilling Book,When I received this book I was very pleased. The instructions are very clear and the pictures are beautiful. It is a great book for beginner Quillers but I think even experienced Quillers will love this book. Ali teaches you different techniques all relating to Quilling. Scrapbookers and crafters that make handmade cards will also love this book. I highly recommend it. QuillingCreations has everything you need to Quill. I now order directly from QuilledCreations.com
4,almost as good as The Amazon,The truth is that you can't said too much about this book. is practicaly an informative book. probably his best book after The Amazon. but you should chechk it!
3,"Functional, not very well made","These cards do as they're advertised, but the quality isn't that exceptional.The printing is crude/obviously word-processed, and they're printed on cheap and relatively fragile paper stock."
3,"Good Book, Confusing Movie","The book ""Lyddie"" was well written so it was a dissapointment when the movie did not emphasize some major characters and details that were in the book. For example, Triphena did not appear in the movie even though she was an important character in the story. Also, it seemed that Diana and Betsy were the same character in the film since Diana was educated and planned on going to college. Additionally, Diana became ill instead of Betsy. It was a surprise when the farm, tavern, and mill were in Canada since the book took place in Massachusetts. To conclude, the movie missed some major details and characters that impacted the major concept of the film."
2,Second Rate,"This travel guide often misses important advice, and was misleading regarding some places, while it missed others. Example: p586 described Trout River Pond as one of the most scenic places on the continent for stillwater kayaking. It wasn't. You had to go four miles for it to start getting good. While there was much better kayaking in the same park. In other places it missed the largest hotels and failed to warn that summer almost requires reservations. So does the unreliable ferry. Newfoundland was among the best places I ever explored but the free book from the provinces tourist bureau was much more valuable."
3,too simple,"First, to give the author credit, he reviewed other architect's works first and described the aspects of what he believed showed good design. Then he showed his own designs, very interesting. The man is talented. His commentary on contrasts is just too basic to good design to deserve an entire book on the subject. His analysis was clever and facile, but any student of design (or anyone with taste) understands the contrasts of large and small, bright and dark. His use of patterns is mildly interesting, hardly captivating. When I was finished I hadn't book-marked a single page (unusual for me) and I threw it on a pile of design books to be consigned to the library. Good for first-year design students, perhaps."
5,WARREN'S INSIGHT...,"With this, his latest offering, Warren Zevon seems to be considering his own mortality more than anything else. Flirting with an intellectual, cautious spirituality at times, he delivers us a collection on life's ups, downs and eventual end ,all with his signature wryness of wit. The song titles speak droves about the topics of his inner thoughts. I have to say this album is more for himself and less for popularity's sake . However, despite this, he has turned out an excellent set of songs.No longer the young pundit, Warren is continually advancing, headed for an eventual enlightenment of some sort. This album takes a couple of listenings to break it in ,but then you find it to be sweet addiction. ""Fistful of Rain"" is the most ear catching ,with the remainder all equally enjoyable. Really one of Warren's best albums."
5,Melancholy but filled with great songs,"This disk is a must for any fan of Warren Zevon's music, and for those who aren't, it's a great introduction to one of America's best songwriters. Despite its melancholy theme and songs about aging, human breakdown, and failed love, the disk ultimately left me feeling wistful and reassured that everything will be alright in the end. This is easily his best work since Sentimental Hygiene, and although there may not be a radio hit here (but who really cares anyway), nearly every song is strong and memorable. In particular, I liked ""I Was in the House When the House Burned Down"" and his cover of ""Back in the High Life""."
3,informative,"Good descriptions of different anabolic, diuretics, ergogenic and estrogen blocking drugs. However no info on cycling is given."
4,An Advanced First Work,"With her first published book, Pat Everest demonstrates a grasp of character and plot development beyond what you would expect from a ""novice."" I liken her work to Anne McCaffrey's. Certainly her Andova series, which begins with ""Waking the Savior,"" holds the readers attention just like McCaffrey's various multi book series.If one is tempted to criticize the introduction of the main characters as being too lengthy or too geographically specific, remember that this is the beginning of a minimum seven book series. Her readers will appreciate such details later on.""Waking the Savior"" is a very good read. I eagerly await the rest of the Andova series, and any other works from the ""accomplished"" pen of Pat Everest."
4,IN AND OF ITSELF DELIVERS,"I recently purchased a copy of IN AND OF ITSELF after a friend reccomended it. I should start by saying that I am usually not a big fan of hard rock. After listening to this CD I changed my mind. The way it balanced the harder tunes with the more melodic ballads was great. It reminded me of a movie soundtrack in a lot of ways because it changed emotions so often. My boyfriend loves it, too. He says that it gets him pumped up when he's at the gym. My favorite song is ""Alice."" ""Armor"" and Resolution"" are my other favorites. My boyfriend likes ""One Hit Wonder"" and ""Balance."" I hear that the band is supposed to tour sometime this Spring or Summer. I am looking forward to it."
4,"Charles D. Richardson, author, pilot, retired Air Traffic Cintroller","A nail-biter that will keep you awake at night, turning pages, especially if you have a flight the next day.Charles D. Richardson, author of the military thriller, The Pact, and coming soon, Flying Machines."
2,False Advertising,"Main sticking point: the product description says, ""Comes with access to innova.com RepairSolutions which gives trouble code definitions, a full diagnostic report, probable causes, most likely fixes, and more.""The problem is that you have to pay for the report. You don't even get a free ""generic"" report. The supposed ""software"" that comes installed sends you to INNOVA's web site where after a long and convoluted registration process--your private info, your car and VIN info--you get bumped to a page where you have the opportunity to spend even more money for a report of the problem."
4,Works Well,Works well with my 2007 Volvo V50. Would prefer it not need batteries but otherwise it works well. Being able to see the freeze frame data is useful too!
4,Quick and easy scan tool.,"I got this scan tool so we could recover codes before taking our vehicles in for service. It is fast and easy to use. I also like how it displays a small description along with the code. Some of the cheaper scan tools just display the code and make you look them up. I plugged it in, turned the car on, and in a few seconds knew exactly what was wrong with my car.I dont care for the PC software supplied. I was dissappointed when i installed it and realized I would have to pay an expensive fee to receive more diagnostics info each time you scan a vehicle. The info from the tool is good enough anyway.I would recomend this product. I think it would be hard to find a better scan tool for the price."
4,Good item for the value,"Item was shipped quickly and arrived in perfect condition. This OBD did the job for me, found the code and let me reset the engine light. I think it will be handy in the future."
5,Extremely useful,"I bought this scanner to diagnose a ""Check Engine"" light on my 2002 Volvo V70. It told me the exact problem, in English. I chose this model because it displays text as well as the diagnostic code. This problem (needed new ignition coil) was easy enough to fix myself. I'm sure I paid for the scanner with my first repair. So far, great product!"
2,Lack of interface,This device works ok it started and read as advertised however being a Macintosh user they don't have any interface and I had to borrow a windows laptop.
5,Excellent product,I purchased the product to find out the code on my wife's car. I found 2 codes set in the ECU. I installed the software that came with it and that connects to Innova and they gave a description of why the code might be set and what the problem(s) might be. This is excellent because it allows me to go to a mechanic with knowledge of the problem.
5,Really does pay for itself,"It saves you time and money.I've used this thing like 30 times already. On my cars and a several friends cars.It works really well and its very simple and straight forward.Just read the code, type the code up on google with my cars make. And bam, I find out what the code is, and how to fix it.Have saved me thousands of dollars."
3,Feeling truely comes through,"I read this book while deployed to Grafenwoehr training area in Germany. While it is very simply written, and very egotistical in the beginning, it develops into a thoughtful and moving book. Losses of friends, comrades and enemies alike are touched on, not glamorized, as in too many war books. Knoke covers his kills, as well as his downfalls, literally crashing his plane several times. Great reading for someone who wants to know how the ""front liners"" had it."
5,A facinating story of the Luftwaffe experten,"Heinz Knoke is one of the few Luftwaffe experten who started the war and who had been able to survive untill the end. During the war he lost all of his friends and was wounded 5 times. The book generally is a diary of the German ace; it's full of the combat discription, though most of them were against American bombers. I highly recommend this book to all Luftwaffe enthusiast, as well to the people who's interested in WWII air war"
4,Great book by Knoke !!!,"With 52 Allied aircraft destroyed in some 400 combat missions, Knoke was one of the best Luftwaffe's ""experten"" in the West, and survived the war thanks to a car crash in november,44, due to sabotage, which crippled him. This book is action-filled since the start, focus almost entirely on air combat and we can feel his despair when his friends go dying one by one. Great book!"
2,WEAK NARRATIVE,"Like most biohraphies written by German military men, this one is completely written without any style, in a totally dry manner, that's very unpleasant to read. Knoke's career itself is very interesting and brave, but he could have done more than justpublishing this sort of diary."
5,"excellent book, he puts you right with him as he flies","My father few B17's for the 95th BG out of Horman and they were credited with being the first to bomb Berline. Over the years I have heard my father tell his stories, so I was really interested to read Knoke's account. I was glued to my seat and I did not want to put the book down. Knoke does a superb job describing what it was like. For those of us who have not fought in a war, it is a sobering reminder how much these valiant men gave for their causes. It left me with a lot of respect for both men, my father and Knoke who were enemies, but if they were to meet today, I am sure they would be friends. Read the book and you will see why. I wonder if Knoke's daughter Igrid is alive today???"
1,"irritating, not very good!!!","I noticed my 35 week old cat had ear mites. So I bought this stuff as a quick fix and turns out it can cause more problems than I thought. I knew the Hartz medications werent all that effective to begin with, but figured I should at least try the treatment and hope it helped at least a little bit.. However, my cat has gotten sick from ingesting the medicine. After the 2nd day of treatment, he started acting funny so i called my vet and she told me to immediately stop use. He had been cleaning himself after treatment and ate too much of the medicine. After speaking to my vet I stoped use and will NEVER buy Hartz products again. They are not safe and very irritating to the animal. He still rubs his ears and has been vomiting since the first day of treatment. Not a good purchase at all. Just go see a vet for ear mite issues."
4,Excelllent handbook,"This book contains 69 full pages of drawings and diagrams for construction of costumes, stages, scenery, lighting, and puppets. There is wonderful advice and sources listed. It is a thorough and technical guide useful to teachers, occupational therapists, puppeteers and hobbyists."
2,Where does it say cactus seeds?,"From the advertisement and the photo I thought I was sending a cactus garden....not two packets of seeds and container & dirt. The total price was over $31.00. Unless I missed something in the advertisement, it seems like false advertising to me. Also Totally overpriced.P.S. The instructions say the seeds will sprout in a week. It's been three weeks and no sprouting yet."
2,Leaks!,"I love Avents bottles, nipples, and manual pump, but these storage containers are not something I will buy again! They leak easily. The tops cannot be screwed on to avoid this and since I have to transport milk back home from work, I have had quite a few messes to clean up. I am going to stick with the regular bottles."
3,Can't get the lids off!,"In general, I like this system and have used it pretty extensively for storing breastmilk. The containers fit very well in my freezer. However, both my husband and my babysitter constantly complain about struggling to get the lids off the containers. Although I don't need to open them often myself, I have had a few problems with them. Sometimes, I end up spilling the contents of the container because I'm squeezing it so tightly when trying to turn the lid. My husband, when dealing with a fussy, hungry baby, sometimes punches holes in the lids with a knife to get the breastmilk out quickly (I'm really not happy about that)."
2,Buy bags instead,"I started with these, thinking it would be convenient to use the adapter for a nipple, but switched to the Medela bags in less than a week. My main reason is that the cups take up too much room in the freezer and take much longer to defrost/warm milk than the bags do. Also, the cups started to warp when I sterilized them for the first time (even though you're supposed to be able to use them three times before discarding), and the lids don't screw on once the cup is warped."
2,Really poor design,"I wish I had read the reviews before buying the Avent pump, which is only compatible with Avent bottles. The lids really do not close properly and we've had milk leak out several times. When you pour in milk that is a little warmer, sometimes the lid won't even open. Plus, the measurements on the sides are almost invisible so it's really difficult to tell the amount I'm pouring in.I would not recommend this product at all."
4,Excellent,"One reviewer here seems to have forgotten that the original Sanskrit text rhymed, so to render it into rhyme in English is, in my opinion, clever.As one who owns many translations of the Gita myself, I must say that this is the most readable. Past efforts to translate the Sanskrit into English have given us stilted, stiff and confusing text. Though I love Prabupada and consider myself a fringe devotee, even HIS translation can be, well, tedious to read, especially some of the overlong purports.This Gita just grooves along, painting a much clearer picture of the conversation between Sri Krishna and Arjuna and the situation in which it is framed. Recommended, especially if you want to read to kids."
3,Not enough pressure,I like the Mueller neoprene one the best. I tried three of these. Also BandIT Therapeutic Forearm Band but it was too hard.
1,Failed in 48 hours,The good: best air pillow on the marketThe bad: the air pillow slips outThe ugly: the sonically welded Velcro tab failed.
3,will see how it performs,"Along with other treatments for tennis elbow an armband was recommended. And I have to wear it all the time. This is the second type that I've purchased, my first one was a Futuro. This is lighter in weight and seems to be more breathable, yet I think the Futuro provides me more stability. I think in this particular item what works for one person may not work for another. I am still looking to find the perfect one for me."
3,Better than the old seat,I replaced a very uncomfortable seat on my stationary bike with this one.It's an improvement over the old one but is still not that comfortable.For the price it's not a bad seat but if I had to do it again I would spendmore money and get a better ( more comfortable ) seat.
1,Too Small - Very Uncomfortable,"I'm a guy, 6' tall, 200 lbs, and this seat is way too small for me. I can't even use it. It was a complete waste of money. The seat is 8 inches wide by 3 inches deep with a little bump in the middle. The bump is not a problem. The fact that it is narrower than the two pressure points on my rear end makes it extremely uncomfortable. If you're really thin and/or really light (probably under 150lbs), then this is probably the right size. For me, this thing is just plain awful. I would not recommend this to anybody."
3,ERGO Seat,Easy to install. I ride my bike for a half hour to an hour at a time. I'm having trouble getting use to the seat. I have tried different angles to no avail. I'm considering switching back to the old seat.
5,No more numb ???!,"Before when I rode for more than 10-15 minutes I suffered total crotch numbness for an hour or so with a regular seat. Now with this seat, two hour rides are no problem. I have two of these, in fact, one for my hybrid and one for my road bike. I am thankful someone designed this seat and I can now ride without this concern."
4,"Works well, but probably not ideal for racing","The Seat took some getting used to, but it works fine, or at least as described, once you get used to it. Its harder to steer, which I suspect leads to a reduction in efficiency and thus speed. That said, it's an excellent commuting seat."
3,"Almost, not quite","My use: 6 mile (one-way) commute. I've been using it for a couple weeks now.This seat does what it's supposed to do: takes pressure off the perineum. Yes, it transfers some to the hands, and yes, maneuverability is somewhat impacted by the absence of a horn. But I can live with that.The problem is that this saddle moves me forward be about 4 inches. I lowered the seat by about an inch, per the instructions, but now I don't get full leg extension. It also alters the geometry, so that my leg is no longer parallel with the down tube when at the bottom, but more vertical (downtube angles back; leg is straight up and down).I won't be going back to a traditional saddle, but I will be looking for a noseless saddle that can be mounted further back (and yes, I have this one all the way back on its mounting rails)."
2,oops,"I guess it's hard to review a product that never arrived. I received a brown and orange striped fabric covered beanbag instead of what I ordered. It seems that they would be pretty hard to get mixed up, but there you have it."
2,check it out at the library first,"I THOUGHT SOME OF THE ROOMS LOOKED NICE, BUT THE BOOK BASICLY SHOWED YOU WHAT THEY COULD DO WITH A ROOM, NOT REALLY ANY GREAT IDEAS FOR YOU TO TRY ON YOUR OWN. I GUESS I WAS LOOKING FOR A HOW TO BOOK AND THIS WAS NOT IT. SOME OF THE IDEAS LOOKED EXPENSIVE."
1,Camera is a nightmare from hell,"In addition to making you buy and new battery and memory stick, the Sony Corp sticks you with bad software which will not let you download your videos to your hard drive with music and special effects that have been preselected by Sony. There is no way to get rid of the music and special effects and just have the raw video as you made it. Its a perverted piece of software that leaves you stuck with someone else adding things to your videos that you don't want. Don't buy this camera, don't buy anything Sony. We just wanted a simple camera that would download to our computer so we could do what we wanted with our videos but all we got was a lot of extra expense and no freedom at all with our videos."
3,WARNING ABOUT 8 MM BACKWARD COMPATIBILITY,"This seems like a nice camera but be forewarned if you are buying it for its backward compatibility to older 8MM and Hi8 tapes. I bought the previous model the TRV350 and found that my Hi8 tapes recorded on a Canon Hi8 camcorder would not play properly on this camera. I took my tape to a store and had them try it in the TRV460 and the same thing, sound worked but a blue screen for picture. I called Sony and they said they couldn't guarantee that any older 8MM media would be 100% compatible. I don't think you see that anywhere in their literature. Buy it for its other features but if you want it to be able to play older 8MM you should bring in one of your old tapes and try it in the store first. Good luck."
3,What in the world ever happened to Baby Girl?,"The denouement of Welcome Home, Baby Girl! left me feeling at loose ends. Fannie Flagg has stepped outside her genre here and into uncharted waters. Somehow she does not bring all the parts of the novel into a smooth cohesiveness that one desires. She has delved into some issues, that she resolves in a soap opera kind of way. When Fannie returns to her roots the novel shines and one would like to go back in time. Naturally there are laughs aplenty, pure Flagg. I found myself laughing aloud Dena Nordstrom is a troubled girl. Fanny's grasp of the pain and see saw of emotions that beset Dena, are where she really lets us see what a terrific writer she is. Would I recommend this book? Certainly, but true Flagg aficianados, might be a tad disappointed. But never with Neighbor Dorothy, Doc, and the gang."
4,FANNIE FLAGG DELIVERS AGAIN!!,"I read this fine book when it first was released. I just finished reading it for the second time, realizing the second read was more profound than the first. Fannie Flagg masterfully weaves a humorous, touching, emotional, hysterical, supsenseful, and heart warming tale. True to her style, her characters are eccentric, endearing, flawed but loveable, and captivating. This story flows beautifully, and the reader is swept along with Dean Nordstrom on a quest of self. The mystery that insues is so titilating, one must read on to find the truth with Dena.This book is not a life changing event, but it is pure, rich, delicious fiction at it's most enjoyable. I laughed out loud, I read through blinding tears, I ached in empathy, I roared at simplicity......I relished the myriad of emotions Flagg infused in me. Treat yourself to this most delightful and sensitive book; fans of Fannie's will not be disappointed!!"
3,A Decent Read,"Well, I agree with the what the reviewer from Booklist said. This novel is good ""though somewhat contrived."" Living in Los Angeles I already hear too much about the lives of people in the entertainment field and broadcasting. Fictional stories that involve them are pretty superficial. So I was kind of disappointed about this aspect of the book, especially with the Hollywood ending. The other characters were more real and believable. Life in the South is clearly what she knows best. Fried Green Tomatoes, way better than this book. One thing I will say is that I did learn a few things about the 40s/50s that I just didn't know nor ever read about. I'll have to check on the meaning of the term ""passing."""
2,Cliched characters and a dragged out plot,"Like many other reviewers, I loved ""Daisy"" and expected better from this book. It's hard to warm up to a main character who refuses to enjoy the many advantages in her life (beauty, talent, success, wealth, popularity).""Baby Girl"" is the type of person we'd all want to shake in real life. In this book however, people can't stop falling all over themselves to do things for her (unappreciated I might add). I didn't find it especially funny, but the nostalgic sections did appeal and were very well done. Maybe it's a reflection of the author's southern heritage, but did she really have to supply ""Baby Girl"" with a thinly disguised ""mammy""? Would it have hurt the book if her psychiatrist had been tall, thin, Black and beautiful instead of an overweight Black woman who goes way beyond a professional attachment to her patient?"
3,"Enjoyable, but disappointing...","I've only ever read ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" by Flagg, but I found this book to be disappointing. Although some of the characters and plot situations were clever, the novel itself was not too fascinating, and the ending was a little silly. Certainly check this book out of the library, but I can't say it's worth purchasing."
3,It ranks behind 'Daisy' and 'F.G.T.' but read it anyway--,"After reading her first two books almost back-to-back, I remember being disappointed that Fannie Flagg hadn't written others...I ran right out and picked this up almost as soon as it was published. Flagg's warmth, humor, and affection for her characters and the richness of small town life are still in evidence but not to the degree of her first two books. My disappointment with the plot and focus of this book, however, gave me a better understanding of the elements I enjoyed in her previous books, so that the net result (for me) is that while I acknowledge that this isn't her best work, I came away from it (once again) appreciating her as an author.I just wish she had spent a little more time crafting an ending, rather than sprinting for the finish line."
2,A great disappointment,"I have readMs. Flaggs earlier books and enjoyed her stories, humor emensely. This book, however, was as empty as its main character, Dena. I could not understand the reactions of most of the people she encounters to this empty self-centered woman. Almost everyone in the book loved her, although even she did not know who she was. The book's ""secret"" was uninspired and some of the scenes meant to be funny seemed ludicrous. And that ending--Welcome to Hollywood, Baby Girl!"
4,Welcome to the World,"Wonderful book. Story line keeps you involved. Characters were interesting,exciting, lively, neighbors next door. As well done as the other books by F.Flagg. Can't wait to read her next book!"
4,Interesting,"I enjoyed this book, although I felt it was not as good as ""Daisy Fay and the Miracle Man"". ""Welcome to the World, Baby Girl"" lacked the humor evident in Flagg's other books. I did find myself involved in the character of Dena Nordstrom. I wanted her to get help and find out about her past. When the story of Dena's mother began to unfold, the book was hard to put down. I also found it interesting, how European culture differed from American culture with respect to the treatment of the family of Dena's mother."
2,"decent content, bizarre presentation","The narration of this tape is like a skit from Saturday Night Live - complete with painfully slow reading off of cue cards, stumbling over small words, strangely timed pauses, etc. At least all this clumsiness kept me smiling! The basic content is there... but Gendrick's ""hopelessly"" series is a better bet for streamlined presentation."
3,Product works for what it was purchased for,"I ordered two of these trellises to match four I purchased last year. While they took 11 days to arrive, they were well packaged and arrived in good condition. They will work for what they were purchased for, but I was disappointed that they were only about 70% of the quality of the four I already had and they don't match exactly. Instead of being solid, the finials are shapes welded to the top of their poles and the gauge of metal isn't quite as thick. They look okay and match well enough that I'll keep them, but I expected better considering the price."
4,"Nice way to serve it a little ""cute""","We entertain a great deal and are always looking for a nice way to change up old stand byes. This pan makes ""cute"" little ears of corn that look nice in a basket of a variety of breads. We bought two pans, as one only makes 7 ""ears,"" generally not enough to serve guests and it takes a bit of time for the pan to cool to make a second batch. They are sturdy, stack for easy storage, and make attractive ears. I have not had any problem with sticking, as some mention, as I spray them well first with nonstick spray. While I generally mix up my own batter, I found that a box of premixed corn bread works great --one box per pan of ears. This is not an essential kitchen item, but it is fun!"
3,cornsticky,"The corn bread sticks. I may not know what I am doing. I preheated it in oven before I ever used it. I heat before use and have added oils and pam to prevent sticking, still sticks. The next step will be the Mom test. Maybe she can show me how to use without the sticking?"
4,Like Old Times!,Great pan. Works well if you know how to use it.Reminds me of the cornbread that my grandmother used to make. Pan comes already seasoned.
3,OK Book,I recently book all the books on Amazon.com on MVP. The best one out of all of them is Taking Control--the latest edition. This book is OK but almost sounds like an angry person wrote it. I believe some of the advice is helpful.
4,Must reading for all pilots,"This book covers the material masterfully. He explores the dark underbelly of what drives us to fly. He also reminds us of the people who forget ""THE LECTURE"". I don't recommend it for the person you wish to coax into the air, but for yourself, read it again, and remember the dangers. Use it to remind yourself that the urge must be controlled or else, like Amos, you will be sacrificed to it."
3,Apart By Afdhere Jama,I liked this especially since it's different from the rest of gay movies. I had previously watched Rebound by the same director. I like this one more even if I gave 5 stars to the other one. My main complaint would be that it was short. It's a great film for the price though.
1,BORING - BORING - BORING,At 57 minutes this is hardly a feature film.However I found myself having to fast forward it at times as it was so tedious.They try to sell the film as a gay film by putting a very pretty man on the sleeve of the dvd.Don't be fooled as he is only in the film for a few minutes.This isn't a gay movie- some of the characters are gay and some are straight. There is nothing in this film to warrant you wasting your time and money in buying a copy.One has to ignore people who rate 5 stars for boring films on Amazon as they are probably connected with the films.
4,"Wonderful, if you don't already have these!","The quality of these pieces and performances is exceptional (assuming you like the 1970s-style attempts at authentic performance). This disk was the first of my Harnoncourt / Leonhardt purchases; unfortunately, every single one of these is now also sitting in my rack inside the (complete) cantata from whence it was taken. All sung in German, of course, except for the B minor mass, which is sung in Latin.But everyone must start somewhere, and this is a fantastic place to start. Among other things, it contains (numbers from):* The Matthew Passion* The Christmas Oratorio* Cantata 147, which contains ""Jesu Joy of man's desiring""* The B minor Mass* My Heart ever Faithful (Mein glaubiges Herze) - lovely.It's a great gift idea for the subversion of friends and family who seem on the brink of becoming Bach afficionados, especially if they like choral/vocal music."
1,zipper didn't hold up,The zipper gave out on this bag within a couple of months. I do not recommend this bag.
4,2.5 weeks and DIMM still working as expected,"Crucial has a good reputation so I went with them even though there were lower cost DIMM modules available from other manufacturers. Blister pack packaging was a bit of a disappointment--was hoping for anti-static sleeve for maximum protection but it did not come with that. The DIMM module continues to work as expected after 2.5 weeks of use and because it's made by Crucial, I expect at least 450 more weeks of error free use. At 350 weeks I would rate it 4.5 stars--450 weeks would rate 5 stars."
2,Wordy and confusing text not worth the cost,"This book was required for my intermediate macroeconomics course at Cornell University. I found the book to be very confusing, especially on the more technical topics such as the Solow growth model. I give Abel and Bernanke credit for trying to develop a unified, balanced approach to macro... which they do; unfortunately, the exposition is not clear and the book is extremely wordy and not concise. I highly recommend N. Gregory Mankiw's Macroeconomics text instead."
1,no respones no product,i never received my product and the seller replied to none of my emails.i dont recomend you do not do business with this seller
2,"I like it, BUT.","Very nice coffee maker. Easy to program and set up. Coffee is flavorable and the warmer plate keeps the coffee hot. However, the quality of construction and/or design is an issue. The catch that holds the filter to the top doesn't hold the filter securely and the filter basket has detached while brewing coffee. This caused the filter to swing out from it's position while the hot water is dripping into the carafe. Cheap plastic parts do not fit properly is probably the cause of this problem."
1,Better off buying a different coffee maker...,"I bought this coffee maker based on good reviews I read here, but, sadly am very disappointed in it. It does have nice features, such as the delay brew option, the filtered water option, and the pause and pour option, but I think the drawbacks cancel those good things out. The coffee always spills out down the side of the pot when pouring, it IS loud at the end of brewing (and I'm hearing impaired), and it also got stuck and was overflowing from the basket so I had to remove the piece that allows for pausing and pouring. It also is a bit touchy and I have a hard time closing the basket and then keeping it closed. I've only had the coffee maker for about 2 months. I'm definitely going to be replacing it. I would recommend not buying it in the first place."
1,A Premature Death,"My trusty Black & Decker lasted 4-5 years. The Braun? It started off great, but keeled over after less than a year. Maybe the hard water killed it. After decalcifying it 4 times, using vinegar, and two different commercial cleaners/decalcifiers, it now works. But, it's taking up to 10 mins to brew roughly 2 cups of coffee. And, the coffee's no longer piping hot. It's kinda hot. I only used it once a day, so it's not as if it was overused.I could take it to a repair center since it's still under warranty. I really don't want to devote that much time to resurrect a coffee maker.I won't be buying another Braun product."
5,Coffee Coniseur,"This Braun Programmable Coffee Maker is really well made, attractive on the counter, and, most important, makes excellent coffee.....FAST!I am a senior and this is the best Coffee Maker I have ever had, I am delighted."
4,Braun KF590 Coffeemaker,"Our old Braun coffeemaker had died and I went out and bought a different brand maker which did not satisfy me at all; so I returned it and got this Braun with which I am very happy. Simply put, it makes good coffee and has features that are just about perfect for the family."
3,Not as expected,We read the reviews and we read good things about the Braun KF590E. After using it several times the coffee maker is very loud and it leaks.It does warm the water to a very hot level making a good cup of coffee.If I had to reconsider purchasing it I wouldn't because of the first two problems.
5,Pressed For Time and Like it Hot? Look no Further!,"Is anything better than a steaming hot pot of coffee in a flash to start your day? If you feel the same way, this is your coffeemaker. Temperature more than stands up to milk or cream( I drink my coffee very light--and it's still plenty hot.) It also makes flavorful half pots, the 5 cup setting producing 2 12 oz mugs of steaming hot java in just a few minutes because of the quick brew technology Braun uses. Another welcome surprise is seeing an appliance made in Europe for a change instead of China."
1,Boring and short,"The book was so boring that I am having more fun now than when I was reading it. If you like books titled ""1001 jokes,"" then you will probably like this book, but then you are also probably too young to have had a boyfriend. The only good thing about the book is that half of the pages are a full page picture (one for every boyfriend type) and the other half consists of about 3 sentences, so it will be over quickly.I want my money back."
3,cute book,"I bought this book for a friend a few years ago, and recently bought it for myself. It's a pretty funny book with a lot of classic stereotypes. I wish they would make another one!"
5,Portland Punk,"Punk rock in the 70's was a backlash against the effete swill that the corporate music industtry was spoon-feeding to the public. The punk scene in Portland was about self-expression rather than style; it was non-commercial and completely unpretentious.""The History of Portland Punk vol.1"" captures the essence of Portland's underground music scene in the 1970's. I have sentimental reasons for recommending this CD. In the late 70's I shared a house in Portland, Oregon with Bob Glassily and John French of the Rubbers. I hung out with many of the musicians featured on this album. Listening to this CD for the first time brought back memories of half-forgotten friends and rainy Portland nights. I could almost smell the clove cigarettes and stale beer."
4,A great resource,"This book is a great resource for pet owners. I find the health-care section of the book very useful. I have modified the recipes to accomodate the inherited allery issues my dog has. Modifying the recipes is a very involved process as the substituion of products recommended and appropriate amounts required for balanced nutrition can be a hassle to figure out, especially, if one's pet was allergic to multiple products.This is a great book for pet owners who want to try homemade cooking and alternative medicine for their pets."
5,Real Help for Pets,I originally bought this book at a garage sale and have used it for many years with miraculous results in two cases. There are recipes for natural dog and cat food that can relieve allergy problems and sometimes even remove them. Good information. Excellent advice. Practical knowledge. Proven results. I have now bought copies for others with problems that their vets can't fix.
5,Excellent book,"This book is great. Lots of info on natural medications for animals, diets and receipes for easy meals to make. Definately value for money"
5,This book is awesome,"Once you've read this book, you'll never go back to commercial dog food again. This book was very informative and helped me understand everything I needed to get started cooking for my dog. And it's easy! It takes about 30 minutes to prepare food for your pet for the whole week. I've only been cooking for him for 2 weeks and he's like a puppy again. If you love your dog, buy this book - You're dog will thank you."
2,Another Book that isn't what its advertised for,"When I looked up home cooked recipe books for dogs, this one was recommended. I bought it and quickly realized, its has very little recipes for healthy cooking for your dogs, and almost nothing to do with weight control for dogs that have no ability to exercise. Which is what I specifically put in my search for a book. I’m sure its great for other things, just not what I was looking for at all."
5,Terrific book,I recommend this book for anyone who owns a pet. A lot of important information that will help keep a pet well and healthy.
1,This is not in the realm of the senses!,"This is based on the same true story as IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES. This version is like a B porno movie with lots of acting and movement which is covered and hidden by a kimona. Even worse, the DVD goes in a jerky assembly of still shots rather than a true ""motion picture."" The acting, costumes and sets are less visually appealing than IN THE REALM OF THE SENSES. If you want to experience a truely erotic tale of a woman with unquenchable lust buy In THE REALM OF THE SENSES, otherwise... save your money."
2,It does not have quality graphics,My son would not even try to play it after it was cut on. It did not grab his attention.
5,Smokin!,"This collection of swing and ballads is as good as it gets! It don't get much better, that's fo sho!!The audio quality of this CD (as with most of Doc's CD's), is quite good and will do justice to your high-end audio system.) If big band is your thing, then this ought to be in your collection."
3,"Really, Really, Mediocre","I was truly hoping for a sterling recording. B is one of the best currently active Wagner conductors; more, his Siegfried was pretty good. So, my hopes for Gotterdammerung were high.Overall, this was a very lacklustre recording. You might be tempted to blame the deservedly lacklustre cast, but I do not think so. This recording is polite and business-like, but lacking in emotion; here, I lay blame squarely on the conductor's doorstep and NOT on the singers.There were some good parts: the revenge trio at the end of Act 2, and the Rhein Maiden scene with Siegfried in the beginning of Act 3. But these moments were very rare in a rather tedious 4 hours. I was surprisingly disappointed."
5,Classic American Rock,"I received my hard to find cd in a timely manner - shipped to my mailbox, brand new (although listed as used) for significantly less then what I would have paid in a store !Thank You and Keep on Rockn' In The Free World !"
5,Merry Xmas to me!,I bought this as an xmas present for myself. It's been in my car player ever since and I love it. The only downside - it makes me miss New Orleans.
4,Buy now,"Both the conductor and orchestra obviously had a good time making this recording. My exposure to Arnold Bax was among my earliest orchestral experiences and I am happy to have this complete set in my collection. Generally I prefer the Scottish National and Gibson (Lloyd Jones is also pretty strong), but Handley is certainly up to the task of sorting out the textures in Bax's thick scores and he achieves more than a measure of success. This is a fine purchase fiscally & aesthetically - get it!"
1,Biased Author,"The author is a Jew who has an axe to grind against Christians. He obviously felt the best way to ""retaliate"" against Christians was to publish rubbish that knocked their faith.The greatest glaring error in this book (and all his anti-Christian books) is the failure of the author to address the fate of the apostles, post-crucifixion. Why would 12 men (plus Paul) invite death upon themselves by advocating Jesus as the Messiah? Were all these men as crazy as Jesus? Common sense says no and the author has no explanation at all."
2,disappointing,"This is the first book by Lee Child that I have read. Although the plot was quite intriguing in the beginning, it soon fizzled out as the novel went on. There could have been a lot more character develpment especially where Reacher was concerned. Although I am aware that this is a 6th Reacher novel, as a first time reader i was hoping to get a good feel for the character and develop a connection to him. I did not. He seemed very 2 dimensional without much depth of character.I love excitement and unexpected twists in a book, and sadly I didn't find that here. It was rather difficult to get through. By the time i got near the end of the book, I really didn't care ""who-dunnit"". In a word...boring!"
2,book not in very good shape,"I ordered a book that was listed as in very good condition, but it was actually in acceptable condition, but too beat up to be called ""very good""/."
3,Welcome to DC,"Having a street map of the District would be in useful following Jack's tour. Mr. Child always describes scenes in sometimes painful detail, but where the Secret Service parks its Suburban, ""Hard against the curb"", is a bit much. The least enjoyable of the eight Reacher novels I have read."
5,"Without Fail By Lee Child, Kindle Purchase Review","I have now read all the Lee Child books featuring Reacher and this one was just as good as the rest but different just like all the others. Every one of Lee Child's Reacher books are so different from each other even with the title character the same, there's no chance of you being disappointed in the storyline or the outcome. I will end up getting all the Reacher books on my Kindle once the price drops. Then I will read again.One recommendation for Amazon: Get the publishers to agree to price the Kindle books at $9.99 or less and make their profit on millions of more books sold...the higher prices sent me back to the library for the hardbacks...sad."
5,Excellent,"We need more Jack Reacher types in this country since the younger generation turning out to be a bunch of sissies. After reading this book, Lee Childs became another one of my favorite writers. If you like suspense this is a must read"
2,"Not Great, Not Even That Good","I love a good thriller, and when you add-in some government special forces type protagonists... You can usually count me as a fan. But i'm no fan of this book. It's dull. It lacks the sort of detail and authenticity that I expect in this genre. It moves slowly. It's more about Reachers love interests (is Froelich just using him to relive her lost relationship with his brother? Does Neagly have a thing for Reacher? Who cares, i say!) than catching the bad guys.The novel just plods. We hear about what they discuss over coffee and how many cups they drank. We see Reacher give commands to colleagues and decline to say why. Oooohhhh...Sorry, the suspense for ME in this book was my wondering if I could bear reading to the end."
3,Routine Reacher offering,"I like the Jack Reacher series, but this one is pretty average at best. It grabbed my attention at first , but thereafter it was decent but not very gripping. The whodunit was revealed about halfway through, so the rest of the book was just sort of killing time until the Big Showdown between Reacher and the baddies. The book did finally build to a modestly exciting finale.I've been reading this series in order, and along with Running Blind, this is probably the weakest entry. The first one, Killing Floor, is still the best, and Echo Burning was also very good."
3,"Fun, but also mind-numbingly stupid","The advantage of WITHOUT FAIL is that for the most part the action is self-contained and Reacher has to exhibit other skills than just punching someone in the face. The book moves well until a conclusion that contains some of Lee Child's most absurd plotting, which is saying something. Read and enjoy it, but don't think too much."
3,Another great story.,"I'm hooked. Mr. Child is so great at coming up with great stories. He did make a major mistake regarding hand guns which surprised me, even if a clip has been left loaded for years, the first round will load, it's the next one that might fail. That's why I gave him three stars instead of four. Also, but less important, Glock pistols don't have a safety, common author mistake."
2,Plot dragged out with excessive detail.,Without Fail has a good story line. However the plot is dragged out using excessive detail with little action involved and then the conclusion takes place in about the last few pages. By the end we knew the way it would end but the actual ending will disappoint.
5,Another Great Read,"Lee Child has never let me down! His Jack Reacher stories grab you from the first page, are full of action and are always hard to put down. I highly recommend this book."
3,Another adventurous journey for the traveling man of mystery.,"After watching the movie ""One Shot"", I wanted to embark on the travels of Jack Reacher. This is my sixth and I have discovered that Mr. Childs sure does spin a tale for his readers."
2,Disappointing for a Melissa & Doug Product,"Let me preface this with how much I like Melissa and Doug products overall. My grandchildren have many M&D toys and this is the first that hasn't been great. It's a cute puzzle, and my grandchildren loved the animals on it, but I've never seen a puzzle where the pieces were so hard to get apart. Within the first 15 minutes of two little girls playing with the puzzle, many of the edges frayed just from trying to get the pieces apart. You might say, ""They picked at the paper edges,"" but no, I was sitting with them and that was not the case. After two days of play, almost all the paper edges were frayed to some degree. This one will soon have to go in the trash. It's not worth my time and effort to return it."
2,Not Melissa & Doug Quality,"I love Melissa & Doug products, but this puzzle is a letdown. My complaint is with the quality (or lack thereof) of the puzzle pieces.The puzzle piece edges (where they fit together) are roughly cut. This makes it difficult to get the pieces apart. (You can turn the whole puzzle over and all the pieces stay stuck together.) In trying to wiggle the pieces apart, it is far too easy to flake off a parts of the layers. (Each puzzle piece has layers of wood veneer. Sort of like those flaky biscuits you can buy at the store to bake -- and then you can peel off each individual layer.)My child (age 2) has only used this puzzle a couple of times (with adult supervision) and the layers are already breaking off. My child has not been rough with the puzzle pieces at all -- I've been watching to make certain of this.As I said before, I love Melissa & Doug products, but this one gets a ""D"" for quality."
5,"Perfect for new listeners, a dream come true for fans","As a Lenny Bruce fan and collector since my teens, I was thrilled to see this painstakingly crafted boxed set. Over the course of six CDs, you'll get to hear Lenny at his creative peak as a ""bit comic"" and as a free-form legal scholar. Lenny was a brilliant and perceptive commentator on the world around him, and a true patriot who often seemed shocked that the country he grew up in was turning its back on its founding freedoms. This set captures all the controversy, all the passion, and all the genius.If you're new to Lenny Bruce and you have some extra bread lying around, this is a wonderful set to pick up. (If you're more cash-conscious, start with the two-volume Lenny Bruce Originals on Fantasy records.) If you're a longtime fan of Lenny, this will not only reaffirm your love for his material, it will open new windows into the mind of one of America's great thinkers. Very highly recommended."
4,Why Did I Buy It?,"I bought these pills because I read online that they increase milk supply... but I bought it for a different reason. But its been a positive experience. These pills helped build up my immune system, because i noticed that I didn't get sick for one year plus. In addition, it does make your sweat smell like maple syrup but its not that terrible."
5,works wonders,it increased my milk supplies almost immediately (24hr give or take)and at 3 months my 16lb daughter could not pump it all and i stopped taking it. only side effect is that your skin smells like maple syrup.shipping was extremely fast so don't overpay at the health stores.
3,Confusing Warning Label,"I've read that Fenugreek increases milk production.However, the label of this product says""WARNING: DO not take this product if you are pregnant or nursing.""Can anyone please clarify?"
2,The book is a set of coarsely written perl scripts,"The book is just serveral scripts, written in Perl 4 style. The book goes line by line to comment on those scripts, which themselves are not very inspiring. The library section contains functions such as getting domain name from an IP, which is trivial and code of which can be found on the net. It does not address harder issues such as file-uploading, etc. CPAN is a better place for code like this."
3,Non Fiction,"I have only found this book useful very occasionally, and once or twice when I picked it up, so can't recommend it particularly highly. Those more involved in that sort of thing may find it more useful, but just another average computer book from my point of view, in this case."
3,It could have been such a good movie!,"The idea to this movie seemed good enough to make for a good movie, but unfortunately everything is ruined with such an uninspired ending, as the one in this film. While it is clearly a low budget movie, for the most part this isen' too visible cause most of it actually takes place inside a car, actually something like 98% of the movie. There is an interesting and sometimes intense conversation going on between the kidnapper and the victim, since the kidnapper has installed a microphone and speakers so that both the victim and him can talk during the ride. And it could have been a really good movie, but the lame end really ruin it."
5,Excellent quality,I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend. He had taped them off of the TV when they aired. They were awful quality. I was so excited when they came out on DVD the quality is even better than watching on TV in my opinion this is great set for anyone who loves the Oblongs.
2,Tear easily,"I bought two pairs of these gloves within a two month period. The fit is great and the color is fabulous, but the gloves will stretch after some wear. (My first pair were a medium and went for a small the second time around). The reason I had to purchase a second pair was that I noted a whole on the right index finger as my hands were moist during the washing up. I thought maybe I snipped it while I was cutting something with scissors, so decided to buy a second pair. This one hasn't lasted even three weeks and there is tear in the right index finger and this time they have not been used to cut anything. This maybe be an issue unique to the user, but I will not be purchasing a third pair as my only guess is that the rubber is too sensitive to touching knives and forks during regular dish washing!"
1,Yuck - Too Dang Smelly,"These gloves fit great and really help you hold onto wet, soapy dishes. BUT - once I took them off I could not get the wierd smell off of my hands. Even after washing my hands 4-5 times in Dawn and Ivory soap. Smell still lingering the next morning.They will be returned or passed along to a friend."
5,Best gloves that last a very long time,The small sized gloves fit very well and make washing dishes a breeze. Glasses and dishes do not slip if gripped properly when using these gloves. These gloves also last a very long time. I buy half a dozen at a time as I never want to run out (plus they are hard to find in small) and end up giving them as gifts to other friends who have small hands. My current pair have been functioning for a year of daily dish washing. I hope Casabela never stops making these gloves.
4,Jo Beverley's 1st story in the Three Georges Trilogy,"I don't like short stories or novellas, they are just not my cup of tea but Jo Beverley's novella (110 pages), ""The Demon's Mistress"", in this anthology is a keeper. I was disappointed that the first story in the Three Georges trilogy (the others are The Dragon's Bride and The Devil's Heiress, and the trilogy is linked to the Company of Rogues series) was issued as a novella and not a full length romance. Luckily the novella length is long enough here to pack in the complexity of a novel (thank goodness it wasn't issued as a 70 page short story!) and I really got lost in the story and felt like I was reading a full length romance. Must have book to fit into the Company of Rogues/Three Georges series. Characters in the other books are met or mentioned also, and it explains some things about the other two Georges books. Goes on keeper shelf and is sure to be reread."
3,My picky son likes it,"We had such a difficult time trying to get my son to take a bottle that at 6 months we gave up trying and went straight to a sippy cup. He took to this cup immediately! (Mom can finally leave the house without baby! Yay!)However, as other comments have mentioned, the cup is very difficult to get liquid out of. We ended up removing the inner spill-proof valve so he could drink from it. It makes a mess, but we haven't yet found another sippy cup that he'll drink from."
1,Bad venting,"The venting mechanism designed to relieve the negative pressure makes it impossible to draw any liquid out unless the cup is tipped back far enough so that the liquid inside completely covers the underside of the lid. So it works fine if the cup is really full. If anything less than 50% full, baby needs to tilt his head waaaaaay back, or else he will just suck air. Returned the product."
2,Dont waste your money,"I was so excited to buy these with our first daughter. I thought it was really neat how easy it was to transition from the Avent bottles to the sippy cups and it is really cool because the nipples from the bottles also fit the sippy cups but the trouble starts when you replace the nipples with the white sippy cup spout. LEAK, LEAK, LEAK.... I tried everything to get these cups not to leak. There is a plastic piece that fits on the inside that is suppose to keep the fluid from leaking out but it doesnt work well at all! Definitely cheaper brands out there that work much better. I finally just threw mine in the trash!!"
1,Avent brand name means nothing to me now,"After trying multiple sippie cups I learned to only trust Playtex, but I splurged for these Avent cups because of the brand. I thought Avent put real thought into their products but these cups are the WORST. Even if you can get over the fact that they need to be separated into SIX separate pieces to wash in the dishwasher (cup, handle, top, lid, seal, valve), they LEAK LIKE CRAZY. If my daughter puts hers on the floor sometimes it will just dribble away into a huge puddle until I find it or it runs out of milk. Also for some reason it drips directly from the cup as she drinks. These cups are the worst."
3,Avent,"I like this cup, but its not the easiest to clean. My son also does not really care for the tip it thin and hard to suck out of."
1,5-stars till it started leaking,"I bought a two-pack of these cups and my son had a hard time sucking out of them till he was a little older (9+ months), but he got the hang of it and didn't have a problem. Unfortunately, one of the spouts has started leaking exactly where the reviewer ""Kimiko""'s picture shows--on the rim of spout where it adjoins the plastic ring (into which the spout is inserted). The first couple times the leaking started, I opened the cup to make sure I had remembered to put the rubber disk on the bottom, and yes, both times it was there. I then tried different rubber disks but the leaking persisted, so I narrowed the problem down to the edge of the white spout itself. So far the other spout doesn't leak, so it's time to toss one and when the other goes I'll probably just recycle both cups rather than trying my luck with replacement spouts."
5,"Simple idea, yet life-changing revelation.","Murray takes on ideas and weaves into a series of short essays you can read in one month. Perfect as a devotional tool, but richer then typical pop spirituality."
5,dept 56,any collector of dept 56 snow babies has to have this one it has a great look the desighn is awesome great job here and a very very cheap price
5,US Digital HDTV reciever-tuner review,I've had this tuner for 5 years and its been great. I don't use it continually but when ever I need to view HD programs from my outside antenna it works fantastic.
5,This movie is one of the funnest movies I have ever seen.,I first saw this movie quite a few years ago and feel in love. I have seen it so many times that I have it memorized. I sit there watching it and sing with the all songs. It is a fun movie for the young and old. It is a combination of an action movie and a musical. I would love to have a copy of htis movie so PLEASE Bring it Back into print.
2,Not Exactly Gilbert & Sullivan,"Thought I'd get a modern treatment of an old classic, but what I got was a modern movie with bits of the classic. My mistake, I'll get the G&S operetta next time..."
5,This Movie Shaped My Childhood,"The first time I saw this movie at the theater, it was for a matinee and when it was over I called my mom and told her not to pick me up because I was going to see it again...I watched all the showing that day and went back many times after. When it came out on ""laser disk"" my parents religiuosly rented it for me. I went through a phase of only dressing in white like Mabel and trust me that didn;t go over well in cold Minnesota. But to this day it is still my favortie movie. I have seen it well over a thousand times and my now husband who had never seen it whe nI finally let him ""experience"" it with me exclaimed "" Wow! That really explains alot about you and sheds a whole new light on why I am the way I am."" good or bad who know but I still love it. So keep pumpin and blowin and can't wait for the DVD."
2,"Bought it for a friend... No, a COUSIN of a friend... Yeah. That's it...","The plot: a stripped and mangled version of Pirates of Penzance, with continuous sex references and really bad 80's music.Sadly, I was impressed with this movie when it came out in the early 80's. I was that certain age, and of the mentality, to truly appreciate what this movie has to offer. I.e., Chris Atkins running around nearly naked, and Kristy McNichol's excessive helpings of both ham AND cheese. I remember thinking: this is a really good movie. Sigh. My word. After seeing it again, I would have rather let it live in memory."
3,I expected more for the price I paid!,"I originally had bought it for my daughter. She is mixed (African American). She has real kinky, curly hair. It worked well as a detangler, but didn't do much for her curls. In just a couple of hours her hair was back to the dull dryness.I decided to try it on my curls. I'm Portuguese with naturally curly hair and it worked way better for me. I didn't have to use any hairspray with it either. On the same note though, it didn't leave my hair looking shiny. It eliminated the frizz but, the dryness was still there. I still think it worked a lot differently for my hair.I won't purchase it again. For around $25 (with shipping) it didn't WOW me enough. I need something that will work for both of us and with complete satisfaction."
4,Robert Calvert - 'Blueprints From The Cellar / At The Queen Elizabeth Hall' (Beat Goes On),"Not a bad price for this 2-CD import of the late resident poet and one time frontman for space rock kings, Hawkwind. Disc one is 'Blueprints From The Cellar' that features songs Calvert played while out on a UK solo tour in 1985-86. Disc two is 'At The Elizabeth Hall' from a October 1986 gig. Most of the music here is fairly good and all. But I'm afraid this is another one that's pretty much aimed toward the die-hards and completists."
5,AWESOME BOOK!,This is a well written modern interpretation of Royal Armouries I.33. The origional I.33 is one of the earliest known manuscripts on Western sword and Buckler fighting techniques. This book goes over many different strikes and defenses that help you gain an advantage over your opponent. It shows numerous ways you can get passed whatever guard your opponent is using. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in early Medieval sword fighting. A well written and interesting book.
5,Highly recommended,"I'm teaching my sons self-confidence, poise, and balance, all in the form of medieval sword fighting. They got Nerf swords for a gift last year, and they each were wildly waving the swords, jumping and hopping around, as one might expect from a 7 and 9 year old without experience. This book, combined with Liechtenauer's Part I DVD from Agilitas.TV, has taught them to stand, use appropriate footwork, and hold the sword, or sword and buckler, in the right way. And most importantly, they are having a great time. I highly recommend it."
2,Not quite Latin American,"Although this is supposed to be for Latin America it does not serve its purpose for two reasons. First it treats Latin America as a whole and ignores differences between the Mexican language, the Argentinian language and so on. Secondly it uses Castilian second person forms of address and this is for Spain not Latin America. Not good enough!"
1,NEVER GET THIS WATCH!,"I got the ""Tokyo Flash - Twelve 5-9 L Version ( Silver + White LED )"" watch and lost $120. Information on Amazon is missleading, the watch is not 30 Meters Water Resistant. The manufacturer's note on the waranty turns out to be ""Showers should not be taken by this watch"".I communicated that back to Amazon, and received very disappointing responses! First bad experience with Amazon and worst of all.Conclusion is NEVER BUY THIS WATCH, never get any of the Tokyo Flash Watches, and Think twice before you get a watch from Amazon!"
1,Total JUNK!!!!,It went from the box to the trash. Not even worth the cost of mailing back for refund. Shame on Amazon for selling such garbage.
5,Good solid product.,"I took my time researching a B-ball system, checking with the neighbors to see what they had, online reviews and the sort all the time vigilant for a sale. Fortunately when this system dropped in price I had at least decided on a Lifetime system. The big seller for us is the adjustable technology used. It's a squeeze trigger that allows the backboard to glide up or down. It does take some time to put together but it's easy to do if you follow the instructions. You'll have many hours of enjoyment."
4,Another great pirate treasure story abut Oak Island.,"Very interesting tale of one of the many searches for pirate treasure, rumored to be one of Captain Kidd's booty's hidden on Oak Island in Nova Scotia Canada. The book arrived as expected in like new condition. I would recommend this dealer for book purchases and will search his stock for more in the future."
2,disappointed w/ changes made to original product,"I ordered the product, because it stated it was the original Snyder's Organic Oat Bran Pretzels. When it came, it was not the original product it said it would be, but the new version of Snyder's Organic Pretzels. UPC was different! Disappointed."
5,healthy pretzels,Synder's Organic Pretzels are always fresh and tasty. Knowing that they are made with whole wheat makes them even more enjoyable. They also have 0 fat!
1,Very Poorly Made,"I have used wire gopher traps for decades. From the description on Amazon, I thought this would be a quality trap. I was wrong. In fact, this is the worst trap I have ever bought. It was totally useless. I couldn't set the trap because it was either designed poorly or made poorly. I don't know where this trap was made, but there was zero quality control. Don't buy this trap. You will be disappointed."
4,Good Stuff,I am a big fan of Graham Annable and this book is really fun. I only wish it was a bit longer. Very funny stuff and Mr. Annable has a great simple style that is perfect for story telling.
4,How to Pass the AP US History exam,"OK, this book is helpful as are most AP US History books.However, don't relly on it (that is, unless u have like two weeks left and have not paid attention in class, jk). OK, this is my formula that will help you pass the AP US History exam (i got a 4):1)Listen to your teacher no matter how boring he may be. He knows his stuff, and his input is most likely helpful.2)Read your own History text book, and take notes out of it.3)Read the AP review in this book atleast twice (i read it five times, it's good for your memory)4)Absolutely take all the practice tests5)Sleep well before the test6)Believe in yourself (honestly, a big part of this test is psychological)**optional**a)Pray if you have some faithb)cheat...no jk, that is bad...tell yourself you can do it (over and over until you believe it)Good luck"
3,noisey but otherwise ok,"Not that I mind the noise, as a mother of two Im always welcoming the opportunity to drowned out some sounds, but this thing will sometimes wake my daughter when my husbands getting ready for work! Also, the pressure is so so. I guess now a days they really dont make super high pressure shower heads anymore for water conservation purposes, so I guess it'll have to do. What I dont get tho, is wouldnt we save more water if we had more pressure therefore making our showers shorter?? With less pressure, it takes longer to get the shampoo and conditioner out of my hair!!! lol, just a thought!"
4,"good pressure, good overall for the $",First up this is a $30 shower head. So I took a chance on it and about a year later it works pretty darn well. It is quite loud but that is because of the air pull it uses to push the water. So far so good. I do wish someone would make a shower massager that really was a shower massager. I would be more willing to spend more $$ on that but in the meantime this one is good enough pressure to take a solid shower.
2,Leaks!!!!,"Yes, it makes the most of low water pressure. Yes, it gives a very satisfying shower. And, yes, the company's customer service rep is a doll. No, I would not recommend this product: every fitting leaks! The hose has sprung a leak!"
5,Delighted,I love it. The handheld oxygenic makes you feel enthusiastic. It wakes you after a long day at work.
4,Generally pleased,"The hot water flow here (I moved in recently) is very poor and the Oxygenics handheld unit works surprisingly well to increase it. It's made taking a shower much more enjoyable.On the negative side, the plastic hose that came with it was different from the one described in the instructions. It seems to be a cheaper replacement. At first assembly the water flow was almost completely blocked. Removing one of the supplied washers fixed it.It works quite well, at least so far."
5,Shower Heaven,This showerhead is amazing. The only drawback that I have found to it is I don't want to leave the shower!
2,Great while it lasted,"Lasted about 6 months. After the first month, I was unable to adjust the water flow. It was just hard all the time. Now the entire head just came off and all the seals inside are broken.Oh, and my water bill didn't go down at all."
2,Avoid This Handheld Version,"We've had a direct-mount (not hand held) Oxygenics shower head for 3 years--it's wonderful. This newer model can be hand-held which is why we got it for another bathroom. The new spa shower model doesn't provide nearly the concentrated, powerful spray that the old one does. It's also of much cheaper construction and more difficult to adjust the spray. We moved it to our guest bath where it doesn't get much use. Not worth the price."
3,"""Oxygen"" equals lots of air","Nice concept if saving water is your main interest. As long as you are standing directly under the shower head and are tall enough to be within 6 inches of the head, you can get an effective shower. If not, the ""water density"" is less than desirable. I can imagine that in the colder weather, the addition of the air in the mixture will make for a cold shower indeed.The head looks and feels cheap, in fact the hose appears more sturdy than the head. My family is insisting I get a ""real showerhead"" before winter sets in."
2,cold shower,"I bought this because I wanted to save water but still maintain good water pressure. Looks fairly decent, although for $50 I expected more than just a piece of plastic. It was easy to install. My complaint is that because of the oxygen added to the water, unless I am 2 inches away from the head, I get a cold blast of air. It makes the shower experience quite uncomfortable. Which means I have to turn on more hot water. So I might be saving water but I am also taking hotter showers. The only way I can take showers now is by using the handheld and that is inconvenient. I am sending it back. Also the hose is too short."
2,Great pressure and cheap plastic parts don't mix.,At 6 months the unit started to leak at every threaded connection.I re-taped with teflon and tightened everything. Unfortunately the lock ring that connects the unit to the water supply is cheap plastic.when that breaks off the water pressure will blast you out the back of your shower. Lifetime warranty covers the 2.00 part but they require your original receipt plus 10.00 s&H;Get a good delta showerhead for 15$ instead
5,You won't be disappointed!!,"I purchased this item because I have very low water pressure. I was very skeptical at first, even after reading the customer reviews. But I decided to buy it anyway and try it for myself. I should have bought it a long time ago!! It is an amazing product....I would definitely recommend it to anyone.PROS: Gives you enough water pressure to actually rinse your hair; water flow is adjustable; and attractive looking.CONS: Short hose (although you can purchase a longer one).So what are you waiting for?!? Go ahead and buy it....you'll be glad you did!!!!"
5,"Great shower for man, his best friend, even his bike","I used to be a manger for Sharper Image and gave one of these a try when they were sold by them and recently bought anotherI love these things, gives a great blast of water, great for washing my dog too."
1,All Wet,"This showerhead is supposed to improve low pressure issues. After installing, the pressure output was less than the Waterpik handheld it replaced. It does not do what its meant to and is definitely not worth the premium price compared to average handhelds. Amazon did promptly take it back and issue a full refund though, Thanks."
4,Works as described,We bought one of these about 2 years ago. It worked flawlessly until today when the hose inner tube ruptured. Since it is one of the best shower heads we have ever had I am ordering a new one. Low water usage and great flow even with low pressure.
2,Nonsense,"For those who are interested in this for a better understanding of Neopythagoreanism and Neoplatonism. Fine.But you won't find good philosophy in this little book you will find nonsense allegorical applications of Homeric texts and philosophers sayings, this book simply builds a ridiculous edifice out of much arbitrary ascriptions of meanings to numbers."
1,Horrible!,"The product worked with only one game, then broke! It was extremely hard to pull the games out of the machine. Cheaply made! Big waste of money!"
4,"It's alright, just a few caveats","The redesign is quite nice. But it's only got one audio jack, so if you want stereoyou'll need a splitter. There are also in my understanding a few games like Castlevania3, Dragon Warrior 1 and 2 may not play on this system. The controllers are pretty good,but the jacks for the controllers are slightly different than the original NES and theymay or may not plug into your older system. But strangely enough, old NES controllers willwork fine on this model.It's a nice system, it's not indestructible, but it loads up the games no problem, thesound can be a little garbled on some games, but if you want the definitive 8 bitexperience, this is probably your best, cheapest alternative to buying an original NES."
5,Jump N Carry 950,"Ordered this item after seeing several reviews on it and others in its line. I couldn't have been more pleased with it. When it arrived it had enough of a charge to jump start my F350 diesel, which had died 2 days earlier. Plugged it up that night and my son calls the next day, his car died in the college parking lot.I can honestly say that neither jump start seemed to put any drain on the Jump N Carry 950. It exceeded my expectations. I have had other jump start systems and many times even when fulled charged, you see and hear the drain a single jump has on them, not this one. It is well worth the money and shipping was fast."
3,saw the movie,I take issue with the other reviewer's claim about racism.The middle class racist hang ups portrayed in the subway scenewere those of ther protagonist not of the authors.
3,"Yep, My Order Contained Dented Cans As Well","As always, I received my order quickly via my Amazon Prime Membership but I was disappointed to see that nearly all of the cans I ordered were dented. I'm not concerned about it necessarily, as the dents seem to be consistently in the same areas (at a soft spot in the top or bottom part of the can) so I believe it's a production/quality control issue in the manufacturing process. The metal seems to be thinner in some areas on the can so it flexes when you push on it - as opposed to a can that's been dropped and the resulting dent is rigid. I'm not a total ""I refuse to eat this if the can is dented"" type of person, so it doesn't bother me all that much, but I can see where folks who are concerned about it would be upset to receive an entire case of dented cans. FYI - I ordered three cases and every case contained damaged cans. The price certainly was right, but perhaps that is because the seller knows it's a ""second hand"" product???"
4,"Great bilingual book, but some odd word choices because of it","This is a great alphabet book, with a picture on each page and the word in Spanish and English. The author chose items that begin with the same letter in both Spanish and English. Because of this, however, they are almost all cognates, and the Spanish words don't seem to be the ones that would normally be used for each letter - many are words that have been borrowed from English. It also uses the word ""bolas"" for ""balls"" - it works for ""b"", but we generally use the word ""pelota"" instead of ""bola"". But, that kind of thing happens with any Spanish book due to regional usages. Overall, a nice bilingual alphabet book."
3,Hmmm.,"Well, Rostropovich isn't quite the conductor as he is the cellist; that much will be apparent. Still, in the final movement, particularly in the final two minutes, he taps into a very intriguing interpretation of this symphony as a great statement of tragedy, rather than the triumph that is usually expressed, and really, this should not be ignored. Purchase this CD as an important supplement if you are a Shostakovich disciple, but it is not the definitive Shostakovich 5th."
3,Don't rely on the compass,"The tool seems to have some useful functions. Don't buy it for the compass unless you want to take out all of the inserts... Most of the inserts are made of metal, so they affect how the compass works. If you remove the knife, the small blade, and the tweezer, the compass orients better; but still is not spot on, when compared to a known, functioning compass.I have not yet used the items, but they appear suitable for emergency use, but probably won't hold up for long. Good and low profile item to carry around for that one-use situation!"
2,disappointed in,"The compass was stuck on arrival, the ""credit card"" was thicker than expected. Overall, it was lower quality than expected"
2,Pretty much useless,"The knife is the only redeeming feature of this product - that's why two stars. A dedicated knife would be a better value though. The rest oddities are just that - totally useless. Compass does not work. Screw driver/bottle opener is too small. I thought about carrying the tool in a wallet, but it is too thick to fit comfortably. I plan to return it."
4,Pretty nice little tool,"I bought this little guy mostly for the knife that it comes with. So far that is pretty good, no complains slices through what i have needed it to slice through with no effort (mostly packing tape and envelops)the compass, I've found, never really works on any of these kind of things, so i wasn't disappointed when it wasn't pointing to magnetic north.All in all, for what i bought it for, it's doing the job great."
2,Ok product,"pretty much the only thing that worked well was the knife. its compact and fits my wallet well, but all the other tools don't work so well like the bottle opener."
3,Just the very basics,"This little kit is what I wanted...just a basic blade, and fire starter. It does fit in a wallet, but will take the space of about four credit cards (because of the width).The knife is functional for a defense weapon, and I could probably dress game with it, though I have not tried. I have started a fire with the magnifying glass, but the tender was perfect, and the proper prep work was done. The compass will point north if you take the knife and can-opener out of the housing first. It comes with a stitching awl (the toothpick) made of hard plastic that would probably serve its purpose. Overall, this is an O.K. piece of gear.If I had it to do over, I would probably get the CardSharp Folding Knife, and just always carry a zippo."
1,leap of faith,i bought this just to give it a shot and it turned out to be a waste of money the compass doesnt workt the knife if very weak were u pull it out from i pulled the plastic off the back of it so not i cant take then knife out so all you really get is the tweezers toothpick (lol) and magnifying glass for 15$ but if you like buying crap this should be on your list
3,Does not have all tools described,"I would give this a five, if it came with all of the tools described. If you look at the pictures you do not see the scissors. They don't exist. So beware you will not be getting all of the tools described. The knife blade is super sharp, and the other tools are well designed."
3,Had one for years,"I've had one of these for several years.The knife seems to be the most functional piece. Not the best steel on the planet, but arrives with a good edge and is plenty sharp. Holds an edge reasonably well. I probably get the most use with the bottle opener. It's not the best, but will open a beer with a little effort. ;)The toothpick is about as good as the ones in a Swiss Army Knife. Tweezers are less useful than than a Swiss Army Knife. The magnifier is marginally useful. The compass never seemed to work worth a crap. There's a small ruler on it. I suppose it's good if you need to measure something smaller than a credit card. ?"
3,handy but not rugged,"So mine arrived exactly as described. The blade was nicely sharp. However, the little compass didn't work, its jammed up or something that won't let it work properly (since that the only thing on this that i didn't plan to use, it wasn't a big deal. This is a nice handy tool to have around, cutting open boxes, tweezers for hand-nails, etc ... but it's nothing that I could take camping or hiking. Hence, 3/5 stars, it's an alright tool."
4,Nifty tool,This is a really neat tool that has come in handy a number of times already. This was purchased as a gift for my son and he loves it.
4,Handy tool.,"This is a nice tool to carry around when you need one of those little gadgets it contains. Recently, I went during my lunch break to get some furniture out of storage. The boxes were wrapped in thick plastic, and fortunately I had this card in my pocket. I took out of the knife and was quickly able to cut through the plastic. It's a very handy tool to have, and it's so light that you tend to forget you have it in your pocket."
4,Nice gift,This is a nice little cc shaped tool that you can keep in your wallet or car. Great build quality.
4,Instant Credit,Product does what needs to be done w/ the exception that the compass is pretty much non-functional staying pointing in the same direction regardless of how the card is pointed or held.
2,Mixed,"Nice little package, The knife looks good, but the compass did not work on the two units that were shipped to me. Also, it is credit card sized in rectangular dimension, but much thicker than a credit card, maybe closer to the equivalent of 4 cards. Of course with amazon no problems."
4,Good,"It is a little larger than I expected, but it is as described. Still, it is well worth the money. Well made and should hold up under normal use. Please note this item was received two days after ordered. Excellent shipping response."
3,Average,"The best part is the blade, sharp & compact.The worst is the compass, which dose not work & is little more than a decoration.All other functions are about average.The bottle opener works but is a tad unwieldy."
3,Worth it for the knife. Barely.,"I with I could eliminate the rest of this card, reduce it in size, and just keep the portion that holds the knife. That's it.The rest are gimmicky at best. The compass is a joke. The plastic toothpick will not last. Magnifying glass is also kind of useless.The can/bottle opener/screw driver, usable, but not easy or convenient to use..The knife is pretty decent though, and as a last resort I would certainly rather have it than not.The card is also somewhat thicker than I expected. Figure on a thickness of 4-5 credit cards. It will not work well with a small wallet."
3,Almost...,"This credit card companion is ok, but I much prefer the Victorionix. I bought this one because it was less expensive and I thought the knife feature looked more usable. It is more usable, but the unit does not have other features that I loved about my Victorionix (which someone admired so much that I gave it to them). Anyway, decent product as far as it goes, a little clunky to really fit in a wallet."
3,Half useful,"I got this Tool Logic Credit Card Companion for Christmas. Half of the items it comes with is useful, the other half not. I like the knife very much. It's the best part of the set.KNIFE: Very nice. It's sharp and shaped so I can get a good grip.COMPASS: Doesn't work. North is any old direction.MAGNIFYING LENS: It magnifies, but it's so small it's useless.TWEEZERS: Not bad. I can pluck a few hairs in a pinch.TOOTHPICK: Sharp and works.CAN/BOTTLE OPENER: Can't get enough leverage to use it. It's too small.AWL: It's a point on the end of the can opener. What would I do with it? Too small to be useful.FLATHEAD SCREWDRIVER: It won't work if the screw is recessed or the head is small. It can be useful in some situations, though.RULER: Measures to 6 centimeters and 3 inches on the back of the gadget."
2,Really THICK,"I got this as a gift for a friend and thought it would be something useful. Turns out that it is too thick to keep in a wallet. Would have been better off getting a pocket knife. Also, a reminder - take it out of your wallet or whatever you carry it in before going to the airport."
1,More feminist banter,Newton has no concept of reality. This collection is nothing but more feminist banter standing upon a foundation of pagan thought at a teenage comprehension level.Whether you find yourself rooting with liberals or conservatives there is no level of scholarship to be found anywhere the truth has been subdued.
1,Nope,Didn't fit my 2004 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited like it said it would. I had to take the connecters off the factory speakers.
4,Western large print book,"He's one of my favorite authors, knows what he's talking about.Always a winner in my book. Doesn't have to be just for men toread either."
2,Single use item,"I'll admit that I expect alot from my tools, but this product wasn't even in the ballpark. I suppose if one had a rare need, this tap and die set might suffice, but for frequent use, or for use with hardened metals, it does not hold up well."
3,OK for price,Not the greatest but not the worst. It did what I wanted it to do but that was a very small job.
3,"Okay, but...","This book does make you want to keep reading, and Kisha is an excellent strong female character, but the ending was just too sudden. How could the team have gone from losing big time at one small competition to setting records at nationals so fast? They just make that transition too quickly, it felt too rushed. Also, it seemed like their money-making plans to go to the Nationals worked better than any real bake sale I've ever seen. Even woth a lot of work, they sure got their plane tickets and nice track suits awfully fast. The main part that kept me interested was the subplot about Kisha's parents relationship, because I found too much of the main track plot too unrealistic, even if it was based on a true story. Darren saved that part- he was the best adult character in the whole, a role model, but not too good to be true."
5,Best of them all,"I've read all of the books by this author and I have to admit that this one was the best of them all....The research that he utilized to get the best of both the male and female views were great. And I'm also trying to find out where I can get some of those ingredients for that ""perfect"" bath...=) Much luv Timm, keep up the good work and I look forward to your new books as well as your journey back to Jacksonville soon....."
5,Love This Heater,This heater works great .Will boil water if you need it to and does.not take long for it to work.
5,"a gripping story with intrigue, real characters, and history","There are few books in which the stock market figures heavily that are both gripping novels and accurate protrayals of business. First time David Liss has succeded on both fronts. His portrayal of London in 1719 makes me glad I'm alive today. The difficulty day-to-day reminded me of Dicken's writings.While there is much history here, it almost never gets in the way of a great story. I defy anyone to figure out who is doing what to whom. Meanwhile, his explanation of the stock market, which figures heavily in the story, is first rate.Buy this book for yourself and for your friends who complain they can't relate to most characters in novels"
4,Classic Whodunit with a twist or two,"Immerse yourself in the world of 18th century high finance and the South Seas Bubble. Couple it with a few murders, and a protagonist who can't avoid typical Jewish self-examination. You have the makings of a fun read. Excellent first effort by a young writer with great promise."
2,Admirable but boring,"Mr. Liss's ability to write so authentically in this period piece is no small feat. Yet, inspite (or despite) of its technical brilliance, it fails to be an engaging story. I find myself checking the number of pages for a chapter before I begin one. After reading 120 pages, I am not sure I care enough to continue."
3,Modern version of a legend or fable,"This adventure story has some exciting parts to it but no unifying theme. Stuff happens, then other stuff happens. Some of it is exciting stuff, some of it is boring; none of it is explained particularly well or welded to any kind of world-building backstory except for a weak attempt at 'it's all technology you just don't recognize' and 'they came from earth thousands of years ago'.In that, it's more like a legend or a fable - not really unified or coherent but rather a series of independent episodes in which the hero is given his chance to prove his mettle. Nothing necessarily wrong with that, but neither is it particularly compelling."
3,Nice read,Predictably but keeps your interest. For a free book it was better than a lot out here. Will read more of his books.
5,An Essential Book.,"I think this book irreplacable on my reference shelf. I use it everyday for work. If you do any Visual Basic work, I recommend that you get this book. It's only $15 and it has already paid for itself several times over. I use this book every day, and highly recommend it to anyone. A previous reviewer complained about a bad binding (true) and simple index. Since the all the language and method entries are alphabetic, I never really looked at the index. I also always use the `See Also' listings at the end of each term to find related commands."
1,A fair command reference rife with errors.,"I purchased same with the idea of making it a handy, portable syntax reference. Unfortunately, it is fair for that purpose, but the errors simply make it a poor investment. I attempted to contact the author, but was met with rude, rude replies. Unless you are in need of kindling, save your money."
2,"High expectation, big disappointment","The movie is much less funnier and creative than the first one, and the extras (Pinguins short movies) were of extremely LOW quality in terms of graphics - it looked like they were not properly rendered.It looks like a beta product - if i could go back in time, i would wait future combo with both for the price i paid for this one."
2,Expected better....,"A movie with a bunch of funny and cute zoo animals, sounds good right? I watched it and was HIGHLY disapointed. The humor was rather off and a bit innapropiate for children. The animals stand on TWO legs instead of four. That annoyed me terribly. And what was with a 'Dancing lion""? Where's the sense in that? And how cana Hippo and a Gyraffe mate? Use some sense here Dreamworks. I am giving it two stars instead of one only because some of the music was cool. The plot was really off and draggy. And the voices for the animals were pretty bad too and didn't match their characters. I would rather reconmand ""The Wild"" by Disney. Dreamworks are normally good with films. Like Spirit Stallion of the Cimeron and Shrek. But this was a big flop."
1,Very Crude,"This movie is full of crude humor, and had a lousy story line! I wish I had known before renting it."
1,What were they thinking!?!,"My kids an I love the first madagascar movie. Watch out for this one because it is not as kid friendly as the fisrt. This has way too many sexual references, pointless lion beatings by a annoying old lady and I could go on. It is just not funny. i thought it would be impossible to ruin this film because I saw the great potential they had; but trust me, They ruined it. Please don't buy it."
4,worked as intended,"For the time i had it, I enjoyed this product. only complain is that the sound quality wasnt what i expected coming through the radio. But it was stolen out of my car along with the ipod soon after I got it so not sure if i could have changed settings or frequencies to correct the problem"
1,Pumpkin B utter Candle,I just received this new scent - Pumpkin Butter. It has no smell what so ever!! I am very disappointed as I have been more then pleased with the past candles I have ordered from Woodwick.I am very disappointed and will return this candle. Don't know if it is a flaw in this candle or if this is suppose to be the scent. (I received the large Pumpkin Butter Large Jar ) Returningthis candle for sure.
1,DON'T BUY,"I love woodwick candles but don't buy them mail order through Amazon or anywhere that requires shipment. I purchased two candles, shipped seperately and both candles outside glass shell were shattered. Cut my finger. Thought I had all particles contained in box and cut my foot on chards of broken glass on my kitchen floor. When buying this product I didn't invision a trip to the ER. Now I'm being asked to handle product and return it. I have no intention of touching the contents of the box.It's ironic that both candles (shipped seperately were broken in the same spot. Leads to me to believe they were already broken before shipment. VERY UNSATISFIED!!!!!!!!"
4,Great seasonal candle!,"I LOVE the Woodwick candles and thought this would be a great fall scent. It is very spicy and creamy and I love the crackle of the wood wick. I still think the Cinnamon Chai and Caramel are my all time favorites, thus the 4 stars instead of 5!"
4,"Nice, but maybe a little lacking.","The candle smells nice, and the crackling isn't obnoxious. It burns at a reasonable rate and the only thing that bothers me sometimes is that it will smoke a little when the wick is too long, but that's easily fixed.The reason I knocked a star off is only because it's very difficult to fill up a room with the scent (this may be particular to this candle scent). I was rather hoping it would be easier to make my room smell like baked goods, but the scent itself is pleasing, even if it's not quite as strong or lingering as I might like."
1,BROKEN - DONT BUY,don't buy from here unless you want to receive a broken candle. mine came shattered as if it had been thrown around. there wasn't even a handle with care sticker on the box or anything.
2,A collection of Garfield adventure already published in other Garfield DVD collection,"This Garfield DVD comprised of 15 episodes selected from ""Garfield and Friends"" DVD, volume 2 to 5.

1,No heat,"Another purchase from a different seller that's resulted in receiving a product that isn't ""working"". This product should produce heat and cool, but mostly heat. It does not. Unfortunately, my patients are not getting any relief this time from this product. Perhaps they are old or expired?? i've learned my lesson to purchase only from official acupuncture supply places for this product. They guarantee this will work."
2,Worthless without the exhibits book that is unavailable.,"I purchased this book to get me up to speed quickly in accounting prior to taking a graduate level accounting class. Received the book only to find out that in order to use it I have to also purchase an exhibits book (Essentials of Accounting, 7th Edition, Exhibits, Post Tests, Anseres to Post Tests, Glossaruy/index) which appears to no longer be available. If anyone could help me out I would appreciate it."
1,Missing the workbook and now I can't use it,The ad doesn't tell you that you need a workbook to be able to use this book. You can't even get through page 1 without having the workbook. Now I need it and can't find it anywhere. Bummed I spent so much money on it without having the entire set.
3,reviews 'sold' me,"I was buying ths since it was by OXO & read the Reviews. I expected the handle to be soft rubber but a reviewer described it as hard plastic. The tips on care for keeping the sponge dry & how to re-attach it were +++' s. Since the price is reasonable & the replacement heads a little 'pricey', I'm getting 2 so I can use 1 for glasses only & 1 for dishes. If they prove themselves worthy, I'll get replacements. Thanks Reviewers!"
1,Too hard to pop!,"As the other reviewers said, these beads are way too hard to pop together. My 4 1/2 year old couldn't pop them together and neither could I! These Pop Beads are a bust in my book."
2,trying to loose weight,im trying to find out what foods i can eat and how much a day with the carbohydrate diet please reply
1,Yuk recipes - but great diet,"I love the low carb diet plan, it has been working well for me so far. But when I got bored with my food I knew I needed some new ideas so I purchased several low carb cookbooks. This one is just awful to me - I haven't liked a single recipe yet. I keep thinking that a Dr. Atkins' cookbook would have to be great but I am so disappointed. If you want some new recipes ideas, may I suggest ""Lauri's Low Carb Cookbook"", it's the best I've seen to date."
1,BEWARE,"BEWARE!!! I know 2 people who have had fainting/passing out attacks and heart pains after being on the Atkins Diet. Be very,very careful what you are doing with this diet!! Neither were in bad health or had previous problems...."
5,Ignore the ignorance of previous reviewers,"The Atkins diet is NOT dangerous -- when done correctly. People screw up on Atkins because they DON'T READ THE BOOK. They don't know about the ""induction"" (lasts 2 weeks; a couple of days of light-headedness is normal while in transition) and then further phases; they don't bother with the supplements that are crucial to Atkins success. They don't realize the plan is ""controlled carbs"" not ""no carbs."" Please ignore the ignorant remarks made by some others and get this great recipe book -- it's a life-saver!"
2,Adore the diet - but found only a few useful recipes,"I've long enjoyed cooking elegant meals nearly as much as consuming them, but found very few recipes in this cookbook that are practical to prepare. Some contain ingredients found on few shelves (except those of health food stores or, perhaps, gourmet shops), and one assumes that Veronica Atkins, unlike most of us, has help with both shopping and preparation. Many of the meals are not appealing, and others involve too much expense, fuss, and bother.This cookbook could create problems for anyone not used to tweaking recipes. For example, the chicken paprika is perfectly delicious, but following Mrs Atkins ""cooking time"" is far from adequate - the chicken was still cold and red inside when I did so. The number of main dishes for which one would easily have ingredients at hand (even if one loves to cook) is very disappointing."
3,Good Product,Earlier I had one that was really good quality. Somehow I lost one of the screw but still working even after ten years. This one makes lot of noise which I do not know why.
2,QUALITY BUT....,"I have a previous version of this item and it works beautifully. This model, slightly upgraded, does not...I use it to close shave my head everyday and the blades just aren't close enough. On my previous model, I was able to unscrew the blades and align the cut as close as 0mm. This new model has an ""upgraded"" blade head that has the blades screwed together. In other words, they aren't adjustable.The product does display a quality fit and finish however. It just doesn't do (due to mechanical changes in manufacture) what I needed it to."
5,Outlasted any other trimmer I've owned!,I have had my andi Professional trimmers for over 8 yrs now. Have never had a problem with them. I have only had to buy new blades when they get dull. I am a professional hair dresser so I use them everyday many times a day. I first purchased them when I worked at Ft.Sill at the barber shop. I would at time shave over 100 heads in a day with these. I love them. I used to have to replace my trimmers with new ones about twice a year because they would burn out. Going on over 8 years with these. Well worth the money!
2,be very careful,"If this is the same collectibles box set that I bought, the cds inside are all 1993 releases and I am doubting if they were ever remastered. Not good value."
4,Fine Debut!,"Multi-instrumentalist/singer/songwriter Todd Bowie delivers a debut album that is a total stunner. This is smart, well-produced music that will remind listeners of XTC, Jason Falkner and Ross Rice. To say that Bowie has spent a large amount of time listening to The Beatles and Jellyfish would probably be very accurate. Plenty of rich melodies and inspired musicianship are on display here."
1,Beautiful but dreary,"The sets and costumes are beautiful; but my gosh this is a slow, boring movie. The reviewer who said they felt relief when Lily finally kills herself had it absolutely right. The acting is far too artificial -- only Eric Stoltz is bearable. Gillian Anderson is dreadfully wooden. This cast is simply not up to acting a period drama (at least Dan Aykroyd realized this and didn't even try).Compared with the other versions of James and Wharton novels, this is a major disappointment."
1,"Bad casting, again","A glorious failure, gillian anderson is too old, eric stolz hardly man enough, dan ackroyd out of place and terrible, lapaglia not slimy enough for the creepy rosedale. While gorgeous to look at, none of these actors are believable. BAD CASTING AGAIN"
3,Fine acting but comes up short,"Well, here's another indi film I waited a long time to see. Was it worth the wait? Nope. As a sucker for period dramas like this, especially all that British royalty, this American period piece left me tepid if not cold. To begin with, I can usually stay up with bygone speech and mores, but this film left me flummoxed more than once. After a point was delivered, I wasn't quite sure what was said, or what the point was. It left my head hurting. Set in New York in 1905, the film does give an excellent portrayal of class distinctions of the time. Women were expected to marry and if you had ""standing"" you married up. Unfortunately love took a back seat. A flirtation, real or perceived could have draconian consequences for a single woman. The film is too long at 140 minutes and although it had some fine actors including Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz and Anthony LaPaglia in the key roles, they seemed a bit off. Miscast I think."
3,Gillian Anderson is wonderful,"Gillian Anderson, X-files & Bleak House, shows her range of acting. You will love this movie. It is slowmoving at times, but worth it. A strong woman, great actors and entertaining."
2,A poorly made movie,"I loved the book, and didn't mind the rewriting of the storyline. But this was just a badly made film. The acting was terrible, for one. As much as I like Gillian Anderson, I felt she was out of her depth for the role. Everyone else (with the exception of Laura Linney) seemed to be ""faking"" it. The worst part was the transitions between scenes, which were too long, and usually without dialogue or music. I'm not looking for an action-packed film, but the transitions really added nothing to the flow or emotion of the film. There were some good moments, and the costumes were beautiful, but otherwise, I'm waiting for someone else to make a film adaptation of Edith Wharton's wonderful book."
2,Disappointing,"It doesn't seem to matter how good a story is, and The house of Mirth is good, casting the right players makes the difference between great and dismal. Dan Akroyd seems to be reading his lines off a nearby wall. Gillian Anderson is beautiful but doesn't elicit sympathy for her role as 'heroine led astray'. Eric Stoltz is a fantastic actor but even he seems to struggle. The movie has sumptuous wardrobe and settings done with meticulous detail. Even so,it's hard to watch without wincing at Akroyd's embarrassing performance or hoping that the heroine falls in the mud."
1,very easy than advertised,I bought this for my 6yrs old nephew for Christmas and it was toooooo..... easy and kidafest for his age. I was very dissapointed. It is too easy ..... I bought it after reading some reviews but totally not worth it.
5,Its a tin,I always liked thses metal puzzles. got it for the kids. I think i was more intertained then they were. the quality is not too bad.
4,I call this worth it,"I just got this yesterday, and after extensive driving around listening to it, I can recommend it. It's easy to use and it's got a good sound, and it works just fine with my Walkman E003 (except that the cradle doesn't fit it). My only regret is that the plug for the lighter is fixed to the device by a rotating hinge joint, where I would have preferred a cord for more flexibility of placement. Still, I am very pleased with the item."
5,Helps with my nausea!!,"I got this product when I was dealing with a long-term illness. It helped me to not have to take so many of my other anti-nausea pills and has been helping me to stay off of them the last few weeks! They not only help with nausea, but they're supposedly great for digestion as well!! After my first bottle, I stocked up on a few more! I plan to keep some of these around for a while."
2,You people giving 5 stars are smoking crack!,"Are Amazon reviews submitted by record label zombies? Now THAT is an interesting question.For God's sake, first listen for yourself at:http://www.shatnerhasbeen.com/"
1,There is no quality of life when the patient is dead,"Just when you think Shatner has artistically hit rock bottom, he pulls a bunker buster out of his arsenal and starts blasting. Absolutely unlistenable. Shatner proves he is truly the Dr. Kevorkian of the spoken word, the Marquis de Sade of the digital age. A true scourge on the ears. Beam me up Scotty, no talent down here. He's dead, Jim.Still, the CD makes a nice tea coaster..."
5,"honest, brilliant art","Like others, I saw Shatner perform ""Common People"" on some late nite show with Joe Jackson and immediately knew I needed this album. I was not dissapointed. There's really not a bad cut on this album; in fact it's packed with classics, such as ""It hasnt happened yet"", and ""I cant get behind that"". Taken as a whole, the album is light years hipper than most work released in the last decade. The album is brutally honest, Wil lays it out without fear. As a spoken word and performance artist myself I can appreciate Shatner's approach--it is very effective and works wonderfully in the context of the music.I can now only go back and get the old classics, like ""transformed man"", and hope that the future will bringmore William Shatner albums. Great stuff."
5,Excellent!!!,"We are blessed to have the brilliant musician that is Ben Folds and this album is no exception. Plus, Shatner gives a delightful mockery of himself yet can still be serious at times too (he really adds a lot to some great music). But you don't have to be a huge Ben Fold's fan and a Trekkie like I am to enjoy this album. Thanks guys. A+"
5,Capn Kirk at his best!,"If you like Willam Shatner you will love this cd, lots of fun and the duets are excellent. Great cd for a nice car ride."
5,So funny!,"I love this CD, it is so much fun to listen to. Who knew! The words just crack me up. I borrowed the CD from my mom who said it was good, and she was right. The music is good and so are the lyrics. Worth buying!"
4,150 reviews! She can't take much more captain....,"But still, I had to weigh in because, really it is a good album! Like probably too many Star Trek fans, I got this as a joke present, and yet, this CD is really no joke. It's a really good album, with some really talented musicians lending a hand. The contributions of Joe Jackson and Adrien Baleu really make this a rockin' collection of covers. I do have a copy of Shatner's regrettable ""Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds,"" which I play when I want my guests to leave at the end of a party. This is completely different. You need to buy this CD just for the conversation starting quality... ""listen to this CD by William Shatner, it's actually quite good!"" I especially recommend this to men approaching the midlife crisis years, it's cheaper than the Ferrari and affair with a woman too young for you, but it captures some of the same feelings."
4,Good Bio; Good history of his times also.,A good read. A balanced account of his life and his attitudes. Enjoyed reading of his life leading up to his historic flight and also to WWII.
5,Don't waste your time reading these reviews; read the book.,"I will simply add my accolades to the others who found this biography fascinating and worthwhile. C.A.L was my father's hero, and I never really understood why unitl I read Berg's book which enabled me to capture the times in which my father lived. Enjoy!"
1,WHAT A BORE !!!!,I want my money back. This grossly over-hyped book was the most excruciatingly dull book I've ever read.
1,This is a terrible book.,"This so-called biography is tedious, redundant, and saddled with flowery writing. It has to be the over-hyped book of the year. It tells more about A. Scott Berg's lack of writing skills and investigatory ability than anything new about Lindy. Anyone who praises this book is simply a victim of ""the emperor's new clothes syndrome"" -- they're either friends of the ""author"" or too narrow-minded to realize they're praising trash passing as biography. Good for a doorstop and that's it."
5,"A thorough study of Lindbergh and an easy, interesting read.","Biographies are often are dry and many times offer an incomplete picture of the subject. This book is a wonderful exception. I was at first intimidated by the book's length (628 pages). But I quickly found myself drawn into this extremely well-written account of a fascinating individual's life. Scott Berg spent 10 years researching Lindbergh, and it shows; I can't imagine getting a more complete picture of Lindbergh's life from any other source. Most interesting to me is the help he received from Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow Lindbergh. The author's account of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby is riveting, and Berg presents enough facts about Lindbergh's so-called Nazi sympathies to set the record straight. When I finished this book, I wanted to write the author and thank him for taking the time to give the world this information."
2,Watery and Bland,"I found it to be watery. At least, more so than other canned pumpkin. It's likely less watery than fresh pumpkin puree, but definitely more watery than Libby's or the generic brand at my grocery store.The texture upon opening this organic one was smooth while the other was irregular. It made my pies taste a bit bland as well, but I also made a mistake with the crust (too much water) so that had a hand in my pie disappearing in two days rather than one.I really liked the art, though. The label. It's nice.Basically, it won't make a fantastic pie, but it'll do. Especially if you would like organic. I suggest straining through coffee filters (placed over a mesh colander) overnight or longer."
3,Dented Cans,"I was impressed with the service (price) and speed of delivery - but disappointed when half of the cans in the case arrived severely dented. I didn't bother with asking for replacement - we had an immediate use for the product (made lots of pumpkin pie), so this is a word of caution to other buyers. We will do this again - but next time, we will not be so forgiving."
3,Pumpkin,"This product is okay, the cans were all dented when received, all 12 cans.. This pumpkin is very runny...had to use more flour than the recipe called for."
2,Damaged/Bent cans,"Ordered a 12 pack of 15 ounce cans of pumpkin. Received the order and about 10 of the cans were dented or bent (some severely). The cans were obviously not bent or damaged in shipping. The cans were crated, wrapped in bubble wrap, and packed in an undamaged Amazon shipping box. It was as if someone picked through the cans and packed dented and bent cans. I considered returning the order but needed it right away. I use the pumpkin to moisten dry food for my dog which eats special food for severe allergies. The pumpkin was fine but the impression created by the vendor with the condition of the cans was not acceptable. I do not intend to order from this vendor again."
4,a cure for the dog from Amazon,My dog sometimes gets an upset stomach. The vet recommended that I feed Buddy rice and pumpkin to get him regulated again. Buddy is a large 100+ Golden Retriever. I didn't want to give him just any kind of pumpkin so looked for an organic one. He loves it - and it makes me feel good about giving it to him.
5,Excellent Value,"The cans I received in Jan 2011 were not damaged at all. The pumpkin is sweet, fresh and delicious as it should be, and the price cannot be beat!"
4,"Love the puree, hate the price","Our cats love this stuff, and we love what it does for the cats' digestion.Price seems to have jumped pretty high recently on Amazon. We shopped around on the Web and found cheaper sources.Free market at work."
2,Dented cans,"The pumpkin is good, but 7 out of the 12 cans arrived dented (and not just little dents). I read that dents aren't a big deal unless they are at the seams of the cans (which most of these are at the top or the bottom). Would have been a good deal, but I'm definitely disappointed. Like other reviews said, these dents don't appear to be from them being shipped as cans that were even packaged in the middle were dented, makes you think they are selling the companies ""seconds"" or something."
1,Damaged cans!!!,I just ordered this product for the first time and I was really bummed when I got it yesterday. 7 cans out of 12 were dented pretty good. Amazon was nice and gave me a full refund. Really sucks the can were damaged i was looking forward to making some organic pumpkin pie.
5,Organic Pumpkin,"Product was shipped quickly, was exactly as described. will do business with them again."
1,BIG mistake,"i just received my cans and should have listened to the reviews. i tried to be positive and go with the reviews who received the cans in perfect shape. what a mistake. ALL but 2 cans were severely dented. the other 2 still had dents. i don't think i could open them if i tried, but i would be afraid to eat the product anyway. i will not pay to send them back. they were wrapped well in bubble wrap so they weren't damaged in transit. they were sent out with the sender KNOWINGLY sending imperfect cans. they should be ashamed of themselves, and if they want them back they should pay for the shipping! i WILL not be taken in again. i want my money back. this is the FIRST item from amazon i have not been happy with."
2,"Great idea, poor sound quality.","I bought this product a couple days after getting my TomTom 510. Great idea and I like it for the most part, but I experience the same problem with popping and crackling noises. The connection to my iPod is fine and it plays through the speakers fine, but the quality is a shame. I don't know if a software update by TomTom will fix this or if it's a hardware issue, but I hope it gets resolved. I love the unit and the iPod and phone features too much for this sound issue to ruin it. I'm hoping they come out with an update to address the missing podcast menu at the same time fixing the sound issue. Right now not really worth it, but could be with a fix from TomTom."
1,Sent 3 different colors,"First ordered 3 Woodtone vinyl mini-blinds. 2 were the same color, 1 darker. Thought if I ordered 1 more, it would have to match something. Wrong. There is another -this time they sent Pecan. Darker yet. I don't know how to get this resolved.Amazon doesn't take responsibility for Moshell's. Do I dare order another?It costs more to return it."
2,wrong color wrong size,save your money and time this company sends you what ever is in stock not what you ask for.what a rip off
1,Don't believe them,"As a Catholic who works with top Catholic theologians, this book is incredibly weak. They have no understanding of what the Catholic Church actually teaches. They give very little Biblical references. For each issue they pick one verse and proclaim that it must mean the Catholic Church is wrong. Well with every one verse that they give, I could give about twenty verses to support the Catholic faith. It is true that people are not being educated properly in the Catholic faith, but that means we have to fight harder and search for the truth ourselves in the Bible and through Tradition."
3,Parker definitely forgot the ending!,"I was willing to give Sunny another chance in this second outing. After all, if Mr. Parker wants to digress from the Spenser series (not that he does by much), he should be allowed to do that. After all, the characters are really quite similar right down to Rosie, the miniature bull terrier, to Pearl, the wonder dog Lab- just with different names. The dialog is wonderfully Parker - humorous, intelligent, flamboyant, interesting. However, what I cannot forgive is the lack of an ending. I truly thought that the pages had somehow been ripped from my book. Alas, not to be. Others have found the ending to be missing as well - and it's not even a clever miss with a promise of a future. I feel cheated, Mr. Parker, and I find it hard to give you absolution for that."
2,what happened?,"I've never wrote a review but i wanted to share some comments. I read the first book in the series and i liked it but Perish Twice left me less than impressed. Am I the only one who wants to know what happened to Millie from the first book? There should of been at least some mention of her in the second book, since she was still living with her at the end of the last one. And why does this investigation end pretty much the same as the last one? I guess I'll read one more but if it doesn't get better it will probably be the last one."
3,Entertaining but too many similarities....,"Having just finished Robert Parker's Death in Paradise, I immediately picked up Perish Twice and thought I was reading the same book. There are just way too many similarities between Jesse Stone (Death in Paradise) and PI Sunny Randall. Both are divorced. Both are still stuck on their ex's and meet them once a week for dinner. Both are quick with a comback, although Sunny has more interesting friends than Jesse Stone. In both books, the plots are a bit lame and they resolve themselves a little too quickly. Both are quick reads with way too much paper wasted between dozens of chapters (66 chapters in Death in Paradise vs. 58 in Perish Twice). You can read each book in only 90 minutes. The only reason I gave it three stars is that Parker's dialogue is always first rate. Otherwise, I wasn't much impressed with Perish Twice."
3,Perish Twice,If you like Robert B. Parker--you will like this book. I enjoyed reading Perish Twice but it was not as good as Family Honor or Melancholy Baby. I love the character Sunny Randall! I am anxious to read the rest of the series featuring her.
2,Not up to par,"I applaud Parker's efforts to develop new characters outside of the Spenser series, but this book fails to engage or provide any of the interest or suspense present in that body of work. You have to write what you know I suppose, but the parallels between Sunny and Spenser are too strong not to see this as an extension of the same character (same job, same city, same philosophies). The problem with this book is that most of the surrounding characters and flat and innane. The only engaging characters (The Burkes) get little development. If you are looking for a departure from the Spenser series, put this one aside and read Parker's excellent perspective of the Earps and Tombstone in ""Gunman's Rhapsody"" or one of his Chandler novels."
5,I imagine even Morgan would be impressed.,"Jean Strouse's powerful gift to tell a story combined with her intellectual muscle lead to a riveting biography of J.P. Morgan's life. I read this book when it first came out. I remember at some point there after visiting The Morgan Library and some ""Morgan -- Bella da Costa Greene"" missive was on display which I found enchanting after reading about the unusual and dynamic woman that came to work on his collection. ""Morgan American Financier"" is a great read and I imagine J.P. Morgan would approve."
3,It left me a little short,"This sweeping biography is exquisitely detailed witht the facts of Morgan's life. And that's what the book is, facts. I know about Morgan's financial deals, his artistic deals, his affairs, but I never see the heart of the man. I'm left with little insight on the man himself. It's all facts and little or no feeling.Much of this is due to the subject himself, who the writer notes was found in his study burning personal letters that may have given us some insight on his feelings.If you don't need that though, and you want to know about the era of Morgan then I'd recommend the book. If you want to get to the marrow of the man, then I'd recommend looking somewhere else (if there is a somewhere to look)."
2,TomTom RDS-TMC,It does not bring in very much signal to allow usable traffic reports in my area making it almost useless.
2,Doesn't work in Europe,"The antenna was easy to install and was quickly recognized by my TomTom GO 930, however, it will not work with the maps of Western Europe. The TomTom doesn't even try to tune the the antenna, it just displays a screen that states the RDS antenna is not compatible with the current (Europe) map. Bottom line is if you visit Europe (I am currently in Germany), save your money and don't buy this product thinking it will work for you outside of North America."
3,Fun but Difficult!!,Game is really fun. Who wouldn't like shooting down nazi's and sinking ships all while being shot at and possibly shot down yourself. Game can be really challenging and difficult at times and may require a walkthrough for certain missions. I gave it a total of 3 out of five stars for overall do to the aggrivation and frustration of it being so difficult and lacking graphics.
3,"Its ok, but Wii Resort flying controls are better","The game itself is ok, but what I found right away is that the controls and overall ""feel"" of control of the aircraft is no where near as good as Wii Resort airplane dogfight. And thats a childs game that can be fun for adults. Oh well. May be its the age of this game, and the extra motion controller used in Resort helping out. I'm hoping for a decent jet figher game for the Wii sometime soon."
3,Good but difficult,"It is a nice game, but too difficult to play.I'm not sure teenagers will like it or not, but for me, it is breathtaking but too hard!!"
3,Play for the fun of it,"I am not really a big video game buff which makes sort of an amateur at gaming but I still managed to progress through most of the game. The controllers are illogical and the graphics aren't anything to write home about. This combination made the obstacle course-type stage through the glacier a nightmare for me. But it's still a fun game and entertained me for a couple of weeks I waited (and am still waiting) for better Wii games. My favorite aspect of the game is flying through European cities like London, Paris and Berlin. It might only be worth a rental to some folks or something to pick up used at the game shop."
4,A great shoot 'em up game,"Although I have yet to play this game, from the reviews that I read I am really excited about playing it. I am a fan of WWII games and especially ones concerning fighter planes. ENJOY!"
4,Great Product,It is a great product that I have been using until it broke down and I needed a new one.
4,VIDAL AIR BRUSH AND DRYER,IT DOES A GOOD JOB DRYING AND CURLING BUT I THOUGHT THE BARREL ROTATED. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE.
2,Little Disappointed,"Not what I expected, just a curling iron w/ bristles. Handle is quite fat, hair got tangled and the quick release didn't work as well. At one point, I had to pull the plug, and take off the brush portion to untangle my hair!Not using it very much. Hair definetly must be almost dry for this to work. Also quite noisy."
2,not as great as i thought.....,I bought this brush because i wanted to play with curls and just the style of my hair..sadly it broke after just the second use. material is cheap
1,"Is cheap, but feels cheap","I bought this based on the positive reviews and the price, but you definitely get what you pay for in this case. This dryer feels really cheap, like there's hardly anything going on in the handle (on the positive side, it makes this really light), but it doesn't put out a lot of air or heat. It also gives off a nasty off-gassing smell even after using it multiple times. My hair (straight, fine-ish) has also gotten tangled in this as I've tried to release the curl, and not just a little tangled, but ripping-hair-out-by-the-roots tangled. My husband even had to help me get it out of the back of my hair once.The few times I've been able for it to hold and release successfully, it does leave a decent curl/wave on small sections of hair, but it's not worth the hassle or the nauseating smell. I would have returned, but it comes in that horrible clamshell packaging that I had to destroy upon opening, so I didn't bother."
1,Does nothing!,"Not only did this product not do anything beneficial, it actually made my hair look worse than if I had used a blowdryer and brush. It has no power and was a complete waste of money."
1,"Unfortunately, the bad reviews are true","I risked buying one of these, because it was the maximum amount of TV I could fit into my 32"" cabinet. But I should have listened to the warnings. When I got the TV in the cabinet and turned it on, the screen was spotted by blobs of pink, green, and blue. The picture tube was shot. I have no choice now but to wait for Toshiba to bring another and hope it works better."
1,Intrinsic problem..,"I tested various sources. My conclusion is..1. Geometry is really crap. I know every direct tube TV cannot be perfect in geometry, but this one is beyond it. Toshiba has to be responsible for this issue.2. Significantly out of focus. Left side is ok, but on the right side I cannot read any characters. Especially, it is almost impossible to play any RPG games. And, this is apparent in watching DVD.To sum up, I cannot recommend you to buy this TV. Please, do not believe every positive review."
5,4+ stars for quality and 5 stars for value,"While not as fancy as the Delta unit it replaced, or the DeWalt stand I almost bought, this is still a very nice stand that gives nothing away in strength or stability to it's more expensive brothers. Went together in less than 30 minutes, and had no problems with the spring clips others have mentioned. Good fit and no sharp edges. The fact that it is more compact than the others is a plus for me too. This has to be a value leader. If it were sitting beside the Ridgid for the same price, I would take the PortaMate for sure."
4,Went together quick with only one slight problem.,"My chop saw had legs that were too thin for the included bolts. I went to a local Hardware store to replace the bolts. I had to replace the nuts also because the included bolts are an odd ball. The guy at the hardware store could not quite figure out what they were. They were not standard ISO metric, SAE, or USS standard bolts. Very strange. But overall if you need a chop saw stand and don't mind investing a couple of bucks on nuts and bolts then don't hesitate to purchase this unit. Works great!!"
2,There's better for less,"I bought this before the Home Depot opened here and because I needed it NOW. HD has better pieces for less money. The unit is flimsy and the leg latches are funky. It works and is handier than not having one, but shop around and you can do better."
2,Lousy assembly directions,"I just finished a 6 hour assembly and am very frustrated with this product. Only one of the four legs fit correctly. I had to use a file and hammer to modify the frame so the legs would fit into the frame. Perhaps this one was a reject that slipped through their quality control review!The directions must have been writeen by PHD Engineer who is from outer space. They are terrible! My second grade son could design, layout, write and instruct better than these directions for assembly. I also agree with other comments regarding the saw mount. Maybe I'll like this stand better after I start using it, but right now I'm too tired to try it out after my 6 hour fiasco with assembly. My advice right now would be to spend a few more bucks for a better stand.I certainly wouldn't recommend anyone buying this product today. Maybe I'll change my mind about after using it..."
2,Didn't fit,"I bought this for my son, it didn't fit. I ended up selling it to buffalo exchange for a fraction of what I paid for it."
2,LESS FOR YOUR MONEY,"Am I the only hard core romance reader who resents paying extra for an ""out-of-print"" story by a favorite author because it is paired with a story by a new or less popular author?I find myself visiting the used book stores and websites to get the book in which I am interested. This is, as one reviewer wrote, a pre-PC novel. I may be strange, but I enjoy tracking a favorite author's progress as it makes me believe that we all can grow, improve and produce better and better results.The marketing strategy is obvious, but I think it costs (and irritates) loyal readers."
3,Wrong dimensions,"Wrong dimensions. These bowls are only 9.5 inches wide and the height is 2"" but the inside of the bowl is less than an inch.I ordered these rather than buying a less expensive set from a local store because I thought they'd be larger.Glaze is OK. Not exceptional."
3,Great looking but TOO Heavy,"I wanted 20 large white plates with a rim for an upcoming party that will be served Buffet style. I bought 4 of these plates from Warehouse Deals to check them out before ordering all 20. Two of the plates arrived broken and Amazon very efficiently refunded my money. The plates are lovely, very white, a great size and a nice wide rim, however they are so heavy that they are not at all suitable for a buffet. I tried to weigh the plate on a 16 oz. food scale but it was way too heavy. These plates are heavier than Fiestaware plates and it feels as if 1 of these plates weighs the same as 2 of my every day Spode dishes.Because these plates are so thick and because they have a rim on the bottom a stack of them would be higher than most other plates. I also discovered prices on the internet as low as Two eighty-seven per plate. The plates are FRENCH in name only, they are made in CHINA."
1,sessions 2000 and my mac,To be honest i could do better than this on my macI've got reason and cubase and a nifty little waldorfsynth yes!!my sounds sounds better than jarres crappy dull and boringalbum at least i've got some really cool bass and beatsOkay im not a stinking rich bilionaire of a musicianbut at least i would never play a piece of music with outsome powerfull driving beats and bass and of course sounds thatsound way cool.
5,an essetial reference work,"This is an essential purchase for every literate mystery reader who is interested in the locality of mystery novels.Finding mystery fiction by locality is difficult. This work simplifies the task with its listings of 5,700 mystery novels and short stories. I have been specializing in Palm Springs mystery novels for three years and found new titles for my collection. It is an excellent companion/supplement to Hubin's CRIME FICTION (II and/or III)and Olderr's MYSTERY INDEX. If you can't afford this book, please recommend its purchase to your local public library."
4,highly recommended,"I highly recommend this title to any DMs out there looking for some new undead to terrorize his/her players with. It is also very useful for necromancer PCs/NPCs both divine and arcane. This book has new types of undead monsters, new necromantic spells for D&D 3.5, and new feats for undead, necromancers, and those who would try to foil them both."
3,DVD audio vs video confusion,"I was totally disappointed to see that we were unable to watch the orchestra, the reason I buy these discs. Apparantly DVD audio means there is no picture. I fail to see any advantage to these discs over the two or three other cds i have of this same symphony. I purchased three of the Barenbohm Beethoven sypmhonies also from Telarc and you sit and look at Barenbohm for an hour. I fail to see the purpose of these discs and why they are called DVD in the first place. They are merely enhanced sound cds in my opinion."
1,Anti - semite,"It is hard to imagine why anyone would so thouroughly turn against their people as to present such a one sided view. The only thing I can imagine to excuse her is that she was a student when she wrote this, and a product of quite a privileged upbringing to even have access to doctoral studies. I was very sorry I ever picked this book up."
4,SCUMBLE RIVER MYSTERY #4,"Another Skye Denison (school psychologist) Scumble River Mystery. This time the crime centers around the Scumble River Bicentennial. Skye's ex-fiancee Luc makes an appearance in the book and stays too long. Simon the mortician is still hanging in there along with Wally, the police chief. Skye is growing closer to Justin and Frannie, two of her ""nerdy"" students."
3,Does not fit MP3 player,"While I'm sure that this is a fine ear piece, I bought it to use with my I-pod. It did not fit. I was not able to determine this using the current product description."
3,RATING A MARINE HISTORY NOVEL,"I ROB M. BEING A FORMER MARINE ENJOYED THE SERIES OF THE CORPS BOOKS.THIS ONE LEAVES YOU HANGING.VERY POORLY ENDED.MR. GRIFFIN I WISH WOULD TAKE THIS SERIES INTO KOREA, AND THE VIET NAM WAR. WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE IN THE ACTION LINE AND LESS BOOZING,AND CARROUSING.BUT TELL IT LIKE IT IS.I HOPE HE GETS ANOTHER BOOK OUT AT LEAST TO BRING THESE CHARACTERS TO A CONCLUSION."
5,"As usual-EXCELLENT, SPELLBINDING, EXCITING","As an X-Marine, Vietnam Veteran, 20 plus year law enforcement officer and avid reader of all Griffins' books, I feel the write has either done some excellent research or has actually ""lived"" the experiences he writes about. I look forward to each and every new book/story he puts out. Whether it be about world war II, police or Marine... Sign me: A fan forever"
4,McCoy & Zimmerman return to Asia,A very good read however it was some what predictable. Milla Banning and Mrs. Ernie Zimmerman leave China.
3,Too short,"Although my kid likes it, it is too short a story for her (2-yr old) and she feels disappointed when the last page is reached so quickly. I have to read it 3-4 times to her to give her satisfaction of having see enough of Lala, her favorite TT."
1,"STARTER Earrings, very flimsy.",These earrings are STARTER earrings. They are in the tube that goes into the gun to pierce someones ears. The description said nothing about this. The quality of these earrings is extremely flimsy. The earrings themselves are very thin and they felt like they could bend very easily. I was extremely disappointed when I received them which is why I returned them immediately. I would not recommend these to anyone. Sorry!
5,A delightful sleep.,The dream mate along with a very very small amount of a prescription medication results in a delightful relaxing sleep. Thank you.Without my dream mate I wake far more times in the night.
2,left me silent.....,I have read all of the books by this author and this was my least favorite. The plot was slow moving and while Goudge tried to build up some suspense regarding Corrine & Buck - the outcome was very predictable. I had to push myself to finish the book. Hopefully her upcoming trilogy will be much better. To those of you who are new to Ms. Goudge....read her earlier work...it is much better.
5,Book smarts,"Purchased this for my college courses and it is a great source for writing papers. The other reason I purchased it was a a comparison to the Strongest Exhaustive Concordance (NIV) and found that it does not have some words that I thought should be within an exhaustive concordance. It is still a great buy, but I just feel that it is lacking in some areas of pertinent words."
4,One slight draw back,"I think this product works well and inflates quickly and properly. The only drawback is that once it loses its charge - you have to wait several hours before it recharges. In other words, you can't plug it in and use it. It only works if it's charged. It won't work on regular electricity. You are better off looking for one that works under both scenarios. On the positive side - it's compact, light and easy to use."
1,Not even Nickleback music!!!!,"So I bought this for my dad, and it doesn't even have nickel back music. It is just pics with heavy metal music. What they did was they took the same movie that had horrible reviews and renamed it so then they thought they would get more money for the same thing. Don't waste your money. One movie I would reccomend is nickeback live at home."
1,Fix the Click - suggestions,"Just some suggestions for the desperate. I have a different model WD external with similar issues. Try a couple of things:1. Try a different USB port. Sometimes this makes a difference.2. Sounds silly, but this ""kick started"" it - try holding the drive at a different angle (sideways, upside down, etc.) until it stops clicking. This enabled me to write/read some data.3. Make sure your USB cable is not longer than 22"", as this may cause power issues.4. Go to the WD site -> Support -> Replacement/RMA and follow the instructions to see if you can get a replacement."
1,Worst possible prose,"Good grief. Run on sentences of exposition. Unlikely conversations. I couldn't get past the first chapter. This is a clumsy, poorly written mess. I was curious when I saw all the Alice Taylor novels for sale in Ireland. I have satisfied my curiosity without wasting any more time!"
2,Not even close to her best material,"I love Amy Poehler, so I was thrilled to find this product on Amazon Instant Video. Absolute disappointment. Definitely not her funniest clips by any means. I can think of so many sketches I would have loved to see, but instead, there were just mediocre skits that barely elicited chuckles from me. Big disappointment."
4,Nice toddler lunch bag,"It doesn't have the cute factor for my toddler, but it works as intended. Good quality, keeps things cool. Definitely the perfect size for a 6-pack of cans. I like that it has separate little side pockets to tuck napkins, spoons, bandages, etc..."
2,Pts Sourcebook,"This book is an exhaustive list of web links and some data about Cerebral Aneurysms. However, many of the links do not work or lead to anything, as the data that was published has either been archived or removed from many of the university hospital web sites. I was also looking for a book that is focused on the process of recovery, and this is not the book."
1,I could not finish this book!,I cannot stand the main female character in this book. She is impossible to understand and I couldn't stomach to read anymore of her. Jamie deserved way better than getting stuck with her. I will not finish it... I will pretend that he gave her to the Indians so that he could find the happiness that he deserves.
3,Pretty good; summer reading material,"I've only ever read one other book by Heather Graham before (and didn't enjoy it very much), but knowing her popularity, I decided to pick this up and give her writing another chance.What a pleasant surprise. While no deep thought went into historical accuracy, or the characters (the subcharacters are particularly shallow, changing their personalities like other people change clothes), the book is actually a ""good read"", mostly due to a hero who becomes more & more sympathetic as the book goes on (he's the first to admit his love, if only to himself). Not quite a keeper, perhaps, but definitely a guilty pleasure!"
3,Poor packaging,I initially gave this pan a one star rating because it was packaged poorly causing the glass lid to shatter during shipping. It was too much trouble to return it so I kept it. The sauce pan works great. I especially love that it has two pouring spouts. I wish I had the lid.
2,meh - too slippery,"I wanted to like this tub so much,but it was just too slippery for us.It took both of us to keep him inthe tub for bathing. We used thisin our kitchen sink and it fit, butthe angle was awkward, so we triedjust using it on the counter withtowels beneath to catch the water.It just didn't work out for us sowe switched to a different style tub."
5,a must-have!,"Every parent should have one of these. I saw a friend use one of these and had to have one. It made the transition from baby bath tub to regular tub an easy one for both baby and me. He was comfortable and secure. Washing his hair was much easier too thanks to the tilt in the seat.I would like to point out, however, that it is only recommended up to 6 months but our little guy was in the seat until 9 months. He was comfortable and I was confident."
1,"Looks cheap, was cheap","I purchased this for my 2-week old infant who screamed bloody murder when we tried to sponge bathe her in the sink. The Puj that we received as a registry gift wouldn't fit in any of the sinks. The PRI arrived dirty, with black dust all over it. It was very inexpensive, and didn't even look like half the price that it cost. It seemed like it would be smaller, but took up just as much room as any other shaped plastic tub. It looked terribly uncomfortable, and I could only envision the baby sliding down the slippery plastic for months until she could sit up on her own. We returned this and have been using the First Years Infant to Toddler Tub with Sling for the last 3 months and she LOVES it! Bath time has been all giggles since the first time we used it. The sling makes her and both parents feel secure, and there's no fear of her sliding under water when we reach for shampoo or turn the faucet on for rinsing. Don't waste your time with the PRI, get First Years instead."
2,Too little information,"This may be a good educational video for families who only want a fast overview of human reporduction, but for any other purpose, its almost worthless. The video is VERY short (less than 1/2 hour), and the quality of the footage is less than spectacular. This is the kind of movie that you might have seen in 6th grade health class; informative for children who have never heard any of it before, but worthless if you know anything about reproduction already."
2,"Dance bands not ""big bands""","I was disappointed with this LP because it wasn't what I really wanted. Unfortuanately, I couldn't see the list of bands before buying it. I didn't want dance bands, like Glenn Miller, who provide sound tracks for movies and employ a string section. Instead, I was looking for a smaller size (13 or 14 people) jazz band like Count Basie, etc. Basie wasn't included on the Big Band Magic LP."
3,"Silly and funny, but only for a minute.","The problem with this book is the fact that most of the pieces they have Haikus for are obscure. You truly need to be an English major and a History major just to recognize the titles. Sure, I laughed, but they got old quick. Guess it's just the nature of the Haiku. And again, not recognizing half of them (as I'm an English major only) made it hard to ""get the joke."""
1,Protects but had hard time working the screen,"The screen protector fits, works to prevent scratches and does reduce glare but I hated how I could not get the screen to work. I had to press down quite hard to get the screen to respond. What's the point of protecting the screen from scratches if you end up stabbing it to death?!?! Maybe you can relearn the screen sensitivity but I could not."
5,Wonderful Pretzels!!!,"I was ordering these pretzels from Amazon and they are wonderful. Couldn't find them in the stores any longer so Amazon was my savior. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't carry them any longer either. But it was great while it lasted! Wonderful product."
3,"an acquired taste, then it's good","it's not your typical pretzel. I don't eat much pumpernickel, so it took me half a bag to get used to. after that, I liked it. I don't like that it comes in a pack of 12; these are regular sized packs. I was hoping for snack size packs. Anyway, the best thing about this is that it is good fer ya and has a different flavor; it's always good to play with the palette a little. world peace!"
2,Will not fit a passport.,"When I did a search for ""Waterproof Passport Holder"" this item came up. I bought one and when I got it I saw that it was wide enough for a passport but not tall enough. Too Bad. Looks like a good unit, but I can't use it."
4,Water proof,"I bught this item. Thank to people who left reviews. If I did not read those reviews, I would have broken it just by unpacking. Before I took out stupid cupboard from the wallet, I cut it into pieces by using a small scissor. Becareful not to cut wallet. After all these detective work, you'll have a water proof wallet. I use it for swimming everyday. It is small.It works."
5,have not used this product yet but....,"It seems like a quality product, thick material, actually a little bigger than I imagined but I did not read the size when I bought it. Hopefully I can still say it's 5 stars when I use it in February."
4,"love the product, hate the packaging","This product is great. It has enough room for money, credit cards and id. It is much bigger than I thought. I just hope we can actually use it for the purpose intended, going to the waterpark. Because of its size I am wondering if the waterparks will let us go down the slides with it on. The cardboard insert they put in is very difficult to get out. If I had not read other reviews I probably would have ripped the wallet. I soaked the whole thing in water thus softening the cardboard and was able to remove it easily. So far we are satisfied but will see what happens at the waterpark."
1,6 out of 6 leaked.....,"Looks great in theory, but out of the 6 that i purchased for my family on a recent cruise, all 6 leaked. Product showed a lot of promise, but very disappointed with the outcome. Had to air dry my cash and other items that i thought were protected. Luckily nothing that couldn't be dried off was in there. I ended up having to pay for one of the plastic waterproof cases at a tourist shop and it worked perfectly. Save your money and buy something else."
1,Very disappointed,"I purchased this product for use while snorkeling. I used it three times and it leaked each time. The wallet is easy to use; insert your items, close the opening, and turn the two locking knobs.Becaused the wallet leaked, I carefully checked the seal for debris, but I could do nothing to stop the leaking.It's likely that I have a rare bad wallet, but I can't recommend this product. It's not waterproof."
4,Treat it gingerly,"Was a little less rugged than I had expected. It kept the water out and that is what we bought it for. Some mild splashing, don't think it was ever fully submerged, but it did spend hours and hours in the kiddy pool with no problems.I was worried that I was going to rip it when I opened it, never did, though. The yellow thing on the top is really cumbersome if you want to put it in your pocket. That is the locking mechanism for the pouch.If you want something indestructible, I wouldn't go with this. If you want something you can bring in the water and put some money and your room key in, this will do. No idea on how it's shelf life will be(plastic break down). Guess I will find out on our next vacation."
3,Handles wouldn't close,"We tested this product in water and it seemed to keep everything dry. When we were on vacation, however, one of the handles sealing the wallet wouldn't close. My husband tried to close it with a little too much force and broke the plastic handle right off. Would've been a good product otherwise."
1,You would expect a wallet to fit in your pocket,The response from the seller was excellent it was the product that didn't perform. It was supposed to protect my money and cards from water while I swam and surfed but was impossible to fit into my pocket. Designed to fit around the neck this was a foolish restriction. The product was returned and never tested.
1,Not happy,"I got the wallet, and used it once with credit cards and cash and it was ok.Tried it the next day and put an ipod shuffle in there with some money.The money was soaked and the ipod is ruined ! :(Not safe !!"
4,As advertised,"Everything was as expected. It was a little difficult to get the packaging card out of the plastic sleeve, other than that it seems to work great."
5,not a drop,"We used this for money, credit cards, room key, safe key, etc. and we took it swimming, snorkeling, and everywhere. It was my husband's wallet while on vacation in the Cancun area. There was never a drop of water in there. Everything was dry as a bone. I expected it to get some moisture in so I ordered an AquaPac for more valuable items, but this worked as well. However, it's small so I'm glad I had a larger-sized AquaPac. The money & cards fit tightly in this. Also, a previous reviewer mentioned folding the cardboard that comes inside the wallet before removing it. Such wise advice. I can see how you could easily tear or poke a hole in this plastic if you try to pull out that cardboard insert. Do fold it first before trying to remove it."
4,Kept the water out,Used this for when we went to different beaches on a recent cruise. Worked great and kept the water out.
2,"OK, not great",Bought this for a recent cruise. It is so thin that it is hard to get anything in it. only big enough to really hold one credit card or DL. Currency tears when trying to get in or out. It is waterproof however. Felt the price was a little high for what is actually turns out to be.
5,Kwik Tek Dry Pack works great,Purchased this for a snorkelling trip in the Caribbean. Used it daily for a week. It nicely held all my important documents and cash without letting in a drop of water.
4,waterproof wallet,"Worked great!!! We carried it swimming and snorkling with no problems. Perfect for ID, room key and credit card."
2,"Not bad, but not great . . .","The book starts out well. It's obvious that Matson is a skilled writer. But a few turn of events are a bit over the top, e.g. getting struck by lightning, which slowly destroys an entire family! Where do writers get ideas like that one? I think that its their attempt to be original, yet it's over the top. Couldn't Tim just suffer an injury from a tough tackle? The rest of the book is good though at times it losses its edge. I'm still interested enough to give Matson another chance. I think she has other books out."
5,PERFECT,"We are a camping family and go out to the desert and the dunes alot. I got a Camelback along time ago for those long ATV rides. Well, when I say these, I thought they would be great for the kids. At the time, they were on sale for 6 bucks a piece so I got two for my kids and two more for some friends. We went down to Glamis and the kids loved them. No more having them sip off of my pack, they each have their own no. My son loves it, he thinks its the coolest thing and never takes it off when we are out camping. Even has it with him all day when he's not riding his quad. Tell you what, they are alot easier to clean too because it is a hard bottle inside the pack, not the bladder type pack which you need capsules that disolve inside to clean them. If they go back down to 6 bucks again, I will buy a whole bunch more for extra's and for other friends..."
1,"Great features, bad sound quality","I received this cd player for Xmas, i was really excited about it. But when i played mi first mp3 cd, when i was listening the 7th song i heard many cracks all the entire song, i thought it was the song but when i skipped to the next track and returned the sound was fixed. I'm using the cd player for 2 months and i had to get used to skip the songs when listening to it. I think this is terrible!!! Any other user that has the same problem?"
3,It's okay....,"The reason i bought this one was because it was really affordable, and had all the features i wanted, like the radio, skip-protection, and it played mp3s! But soon after i bought it i found a pretty big problem. I would play like half into a song, then it would just STOP PLAYING COMPLETELY! I dont know why, but it would just stop playing in the middle of a song and freeze. Usually i could just skip ahead in the song and it would play again, but it was really aggravating when i couldn't get through a single song before it froze. I used to think it only did this when the batteries were low, but it recently started doing that even when i had new batteries.On the upside, I really like the radio on it, it works very well. And mp3 Cds seem to play better than regular cds. So, its up to you. Overall, the cd player has some things wrong with it, but it is darn cheap for all of the features it offers."
3,Didn't get to watch,my internet junked out on me again and I got 15 mins into the film and that is all i got to watch of it.
3,Realistic Look at a Family in Crisis,"This movie has some interesting elements related to family and relational issues following that death of a member. There were a lot of interesting components regarding post-traumatic stress and survivor guilt. The roles of the different family members during the crisis provided a snapshot of a realistic grief situation. The therapeutic relationship between the psychiatrist and Conrad (the surviving son) was interesting to watch in terms of style in rapport building and confrontation. Overall, this is a good movie."
1,wrong country,I received this DVD and was very anxious to show it to some friends. Come to find out it can only be used with and hook-up in France. It is absolutely of no use to me. Anyone want it?
2,Whiny,"Like watching a bunch of 4-year-olds throwing temper tantrums about early bedtimes. The main characters in this film spend their time either sulking petulantly or delivering semi-coherent, self-indulgent speeches.The movie is nonetheless well-shot, with some superb scoring to Pachelbel's Canon. Indeed, the opening montage, in which scenery shots dissolve to the choir performing, is great. It also gives interesting insight into its era. But Ice Storm revisited that kind of material with less emoting, as did Stand By Me. If this movie had been cut by an hour, with the talking/whining elided, it could have been great."
5,Ordinary People,I saw it years ago and thought it was great. Very thought provoking. Mary Tyler Moore did a wonderful job playing the horrible mother.
4,One of those rare gems,"""Ordinary People"" is one of those films you can watch again and again and still get something new from it. I watched it again the other night (after finally purchasing it on DVD). The performances from Tyler Moore, Sutherland and Hutton are so exceptional that they all deserved oscars.How does a family deal with the loss of a well-loved son from an accident? Some will shut out their emotions like Tyler-Moore's character, while the son needs to show his emotions, and needs his mother more than ever. However, she is cold towards him, almost blaming him for the death of his brother. Sutherland is the husband and father caught in the middle of it all, who is also trying to deal with his own emotions over the death of his eldest son.Ordinary People was made in 1980 and directed by Robert Redford. I have seen it at least 5 times now, and consider it a DVD definitely worth owning. Dont hesitate if you are looking for a special movie."
1,Wretched celebration of dysfunction,An unbelievably bad movie that revels in the emotional swamp of completely dysfunctional and unrealistic characters.Gross overacting by most of the cast.A movie for people who have no understanding of real human emotions and/or who are so dead to real human emotions that they are attempting to jump start their emotions with this overly melodramatic cinematic train wreck.
2,Diappointing,"I purchased this toy for my 8 month old and it stopped working about 2 months after she got it> I replaced the batteries and that didn't help. for what I paid for it, it was definitely not worth it."
2,You're So Vain,"I purchased this book last weekend. I was really looking forward to reading it, but I must say I was very disappointed. Missa's constant comments about how beautiful she is, combined with her nasty and mean spirited comments about everyone else really nauseated me. Enough already! We get it. Also, most of the the book is devoted to swinging, which I really didn't understand because Missa does nothing in the book but whine about how much she hates everything about swinging. This book was painful to read, even for a masochist. Do yourself a favor and flog yourself instead."
2,Contrived,"This is a very sophomoric attempt at erotica proper. This is porn. I like both, but I know the difference. She was obviously paying attention in English 101 when they covered simile and metaphor, but she missed cliché day. It also seems clear that she missed the significance of the title of ""The Story of O"" when she used the same title but substituted the first letter of her first name. She has read the book several times; she borrows quite a bit of the language. My guess is that this was published for the ""shock value"" of the language which will always attract some, no matter how bad, instead of any real talent. She may be a submissive, but she's not a writer."
4,Worth the money,"This book does an excellent job of testing all relevant concepts. Some of the questions are artificially difficult and a little on the difficult side, but if you learn the answers your boards will be a success. I just finished the book for the second time and noticed a marked difference in my ability to remember the concepts that i had seen before. i definitely recommend this question book."
2,Overpriced,"This book is really small - not your average sized coloring book. I felt like a chump after I received the book and saw the $1.50 price on the back and I paid $3.50. I should have just gone to my local book store and paid full price there.However, as far as content, it is a good maze book for small children - very simple mazes. But again, the book is so small, it's not that easy to work on."
3,It's Alright.,"I bought the Sue Johanson Royal Swirl Massager over 9 months ago, as a present for my boyfriend and I. This was our first product like this. It is a lot thicker than I thought it would be, and is rather uncomfortable for internal use. The vibrations are good for clitoral stimulation, but there are other products which are made for that. Also the outer cover pulls hair and has a sticky feel to it right out of the package. I don't recommend this for first timers at all, for other beware that this is thicker that it look online. It was shipped fast and discreetly. But I would have rather saved my money and bought something else."
2,"not ""pure"" coconut milk","Includes guar gum, which in large enough amounts is a bulk forming laxative. So this is not really ""pure"". Not everyone can tolerate guar gum. The taste is fine, I've never found chunks in my cans. It usually does separate, no big deal to me and I can eat it in small amounts in cooking but can't have a whole paleo smoothie from it. ymmv."
1,It's only a 'taste' - not the real thing,"A very watery, toned down version. Very smooth, because there are no solids like there should be. Go to the trouble to buy Chaokoh if you want real flavor."
5,Great Read!!,I read this book in a couple of hours. I loved it. I would recommend it to any and everyone.
1,What an awful book!,"I'll admit right from the start that I didn't finish this awful book. Got 54% through (according to my Kindle)and couldn't stomach another page. It started off fairly interesting but where Ms. Adair lost me was when AJ was having dinner with the terrorist -- she dropped the poison in his glass and just as the terrorist was getting ready to drink it, her little secret microphone in her ear says ""abort the mission"". OK. Next scene, she's having sex in the elevator with Kane. I thought ""did I accidentally go forward several pages in my kindle?"" But, no -- evidently our author had no way to get her out of the poison scene so she just skipped all of the relevant stuff and got directly down and dirty in the elevator? Makes no sense at all and totally ruined any chances I had of enjoying this book. I think a third grader would know better than to just leave a scene hanging with no reference whatever to it and jump to another ridiculous scene.I'd give it ZERO stars if I could."
2,Not as good as her other books,"It just wasn't up to the standards set by the other books she's written. It seemed very disjointed, and the heroine was annoying. I was disappointed - but not enough not to buy her next one. Hopefully this was just a fluke!"
4,EasyScript Express,"As an attorney with no formal training in shorthand, I found the EasyScript Express book very intuitive and helpful in my daily practice. Reading a chapter a day I was able to focus on learning just a few new concepts each day and implementing them right away. This is a much simpler process than the formal shorthand method, and for that, I am grateful."
2,not recommended,"After researching for months to find a way to take notes easily and quickly and still be able to read them afterwards, I tried EasyScript.In fact, it IS easy to learn to WRITE. However, it does take discipline and practice to be able to read your notes after a while. There is just too much ambiguity in the abbreviations and compound words. So, while you can be fast in writing, reading of your own notes can be a challenge.I gave up after a few weeks of trying."
4,Very good bar and savings,Sure beats the prices at GNC and elsewhere! Buy in bulk and save. Great deal
2,Be careful....,"I originally bought this at the local Best Buy, rather than Amazon...and good thing I did. The first one had to be returned because the CD player didn't work, the second because the radio reception was terrible.Beleive it or not, the 3rd one I kept. :) The reason I like the model is its incredibly small size and profile. All the others on the market were too big, and stood out in my kitchen like a sore thumb. Subtlety, people, subtlety! This is a *kitchen*, not a theater!Still, my model has some trouble receiving some more distant stations, and the ""search"" function is not very sensitive. The CD player works fine, and the speakers are adequate. It will do.If I could, I'd love to give a ""dope slap"" to GE's engineers, though. Improvements in this model are needed."
1,Worst buy ever!,"I wish I read the reviews here before I bought this product. I read some reviews of people who were very happy with it, I also noted that they all JUST bought it. Mine was great for a year and a half. Then the CD player stopped working just like everyone else. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT. You may love it at first but it will not last!"
1,Disappointed with GE product,"Purchase Ge 75295 Ultra-Slim Spacemaker couldn't pick up any of the radio stations just Static.Took it back and exchanged it for another one, the same problem.Will never buy another GE Electronic product."
4,Mother of Three,This was a gift for my first child and I have used it for all three. I love being able to grind food right at the table; no fuss. My one complaint is that it takes some muscle power for hard food like meat. I thought I would break it a number of time but it seems to be no worse for ware.
3,great concept....an ok gadget,"I was very excited to try this mill out! But I have to say I am a bit disappointed. It grinds mushy stuff ok, like papaya, mango, banana....I have not tried pasta, but I will! But once I put tougher/harder food, it gets stuck. On one occassion, I put papaya that was a bit tough, and it just would not grind that tough papaya. It's great for juicy or very mushy food. I do like that it doesn't leak though. It's a bit tough to open and assemble for washing, but it doesn't have hidden surfaces that is hard to clean. I still use this mill almost everyday for fruits for my 8 months old, but maybe when she eats more textured food, I can try pasta etc with this mill."
3,"Good, but big","I was looking for a food mill that I could stick in my diaper bag, for restaurants, traveling, etc. This one is good, it works well, but it's really too big to carry around. I wish it was smaller."
1,This product sucks,"AND it's frustrating. It doesn't puree food, it's hard to clean, hard to use, and made from crappy plastic. What a waste! My mom said she had something similar when I was a baby and so bought me this, but I will NOT be buying this for my grandkids. I hope they discontinue it."
2,This item just doesn't work,"I bought one of these food mills and was so excited to try it out. When I tried it for the first time I was so disappointed. First of all it's all made of plastic. You can tell it's cheeply made. The only part that is metal is the blade. It doesn't spin very fast and there is only one blade, so it doesn't really work very well at all. If you are trying to mash up green beans it doesn't grind up the stringy parts or the skins at all. I wouldn't recommend buying this food mill to anyone."
4,nice little food mill,"The good: It works well and does exactly what I bought it for: pureeing food from the table at home and while traveling so I don't have to deal with jarred food. I've used it successfully on peas, all kinds of fruit, pasta, rice, cooked carrots and brussels sprouts. I'd recommend it.The bad: I need to stick a fork in one of the holes in order to take the top off. I need a dishwasher or veggie brush to clean the holes. The crank started wobbling after a few uses. It doesn't puree meat."
2,what a dissappointment,"I thought this was like the one I had for my children 25 years ago. wrong!! I thought it was advertised as stainless steel cutting blades, like my old one . well the blade was steel but the strainer part was plastic!! did not work well at all .Would not recommend this product."
2,messy,good concept but very messy and hard to clean up. i should have bought ended up buying an electric food processor.
1,Do not waste money on this,I would like to give it a 0 star if possible. It does not mash the most cooked veggies.Buy something else even if it costs more.
5,What a lifesaver!!!,This floatie has been such a great buy. It provided hours of fun on our vacation for our little one and packs easily in the suitcase.
5,"""Publishers Weekly"" got it wrong","""Publishers Weekly"" describes Lynne Barrett's characters as ""eccentric."" I disagree. These women are familiar to me. They could be my friends.Lynne captures the minds of women (and some men) so perfectly in this collection of stories. She's the writer I would like to be when I grow up."
4,A good read.,"Contrary to the reviews from other people that I read on this site, I thought this book to be a rather good read. I have been a Warhammer 40K player since the game's first release and I felt the book quite appropriately developed the reverence and awe of humanity's finest warriors. So if you're not a wanker who is stuck on minute detail flaws, and if you enjoy Warhammer 40k, then this is a good book for you! I would also recommend all of the other books by King, he is a very entertaining author that does not write overly predictable plotlines."
4,palm book review,"I didn't learn much more through this book than I had already learned on my own. If you have never used a Palmpilot however, this book can be a valuable resource."
5,Book on Palm powered devices.,"Bought the book for a friend, excellent information, they found the answers that they needed."
2,OK Gregorian chants,"This is a re-release of an album recorded in the 1960s, and is basically a knockoff of ""Chant."" Ironically, the quality of the performance (specifically the articulation) is better than ""Chant"". The recording, however, is pretty c****y; it sounds as if one of the microphones was cutting in and out during some of the session. Also, I have some issues with the idea of hawking Gregorian chants as relaxation music. That should be reserved for recordings of crickets or of waves breaking on the beach, not for music with sacred texts."
4,For 16 year old,Bought for my son who is 16. The bag is well built with a lot of padding and large pockets. He loves it. I would not hesitate to buy this bag again. Well worth the money. Shipped out fast and arrived on time as promised.
3,"Easy to read, good overview of test topics","This book is easy to read all of the way through, but does not have a lot of the detailed very specific information you would need to pass the test. I also used the Readiness Review by Perkovich for test practice and the Resource Kit for the technical details. I would not have passed the test with this book only, but it is good for the general concepts."
3,"Unfair, But Slightly Flexible","If you purchase a cphone service, it can be a pain to hold onto the contract for 2 years. But really if you notice problems soon after buying the phone, cancellation is still an option. It is expensive, but still better than paying $40+/month for bad service. BTW, Cingular is great in my area. Anywhere near my house I have 5 bars, and rearely drop down to even 3 in the cuty i live in and surrounding areas. It is a shame though how with todays technology some people have to experience awful service with a company who can give me amazing service."
1,Cingular's wireless service is crap.,"Cingular's wireless's reception is absolute crap. I get dropped calls ALL THE TIME. Even if the call doesn't get dropped, I can hardly hear the person on the other line. Sure, Cingular/t-mobile might have the nation's largest network, but they also have one of the most highly trafficked networks as well. Sign up with someone else."
1,"No stars, if possible","It's been many years since I saw either of these but now that it's on DVD I'm watching the first Flesh Gordon again. The FIRST Flesh Gordon was charming and funny. As to the sequel I agree with the person who wrote ""what a letdown."" The toilet humor in this one can only be enjoyed by sick puppies. Unless you like the idea of people dressed as giant bowel movements blocking each others way through the alimentary canal (and what the hell's our hero doing there anyway?) save your lunch by skipping this monstosity."
2,Should call it a 1 Piece Starter,"Luckily the case was really what I was after, as the earpiece doesn't work at all and the charger has to be jiggled constantly to keep it charging. Even the jiggling only helped sporadically. The case is perfect, though. :)"
5,"BEAUTIFUL, PRACTICAL, INSPIRING, SIMPLE!","THIS BOOK OFFERS A BEAUTIFUL, PRACTICAL, INSPIRING, AND SIMPLE METHODOLOGY FOR WAKING UP TO WHO YOU REALLY, REALLY ARE!I RECEIVED IT QUICKLY AND WITHOUT INCIDENT.THE ENTIRE EXPERIENCE WAS GOOD."
4,Excellent book for new believers.... and old ones too!,"I see that R.C. was essentially trying to write his own catechism with this book.... and for the most part he was pretty sucessful. In it, he covers 101 different areas of Christian theology, including sanctification, glorification, eschatology and much more. He doesn't take a clear position on eschatology in here (he's postmill and partial preterist), but leaves the reader to get some things on his/her own.My only major criticism was that he could've included a LOT more scripture in this book. Everything's Biblical.... but not enough scripture for the new believer to take and read the Word of God in addition to this fine teaching tool.Still, it's well worth the money and will make a good reference tool for years to come."
5,Desert Island Disc,"This CD is one of my desert island discs. Martha Mödl and Wolfgang Windgassen are superb. Mödl's account of the Liebestod is the most moving I have heard. Others may do it better technically, but she gets it in the larger cosmic sense. In the love duet, Mödl and Windgassen match perfectly. The Narrative and Curse selection includes quite a bit of music following the curse that is usually omitted when this part of the opera is excerpted. It is an excellent counterpart to the Karajan recording from Bayreuth 1952 (make sure you get the more expensive transfer, the cheaper Gala release has terrible sound)."
3,Mexican Baroque? That is laughable!,"""Mexican Baroque""?????? Mexico was not a country until 1821. Sounds like the record company is trying to rewrite history ie. prop up Mexicans to make it sound like they have a rich cultural history or something to that effect. Funny. During the Baroque period, that land was part of New Spain."
4,Suspense from the beginning,Restraining Order was a surprising movie. It was filled of the unknown. The characters were all great. What you may thought was going to happen is not what happened. You would never expect the ending but it was great getting there.
3,i agree... just average,"The ink in the writing held perfectly for a couple weeks and then suddenly starting peeling and was completely gone in a few days. This despite the fact that I never wore it doing dishes or anything similar. I definitely have to strain to read it now. The band is shiny and smooth when you buy it but very quickly starts to get scratches. The ring is solid and is cut in such a way that it isn't exactly comfortable on my finger.On the other hand, it serves its purpose which is to remind me of the serenity prayer. And it's inexpensive enough that I don't feel cheated given the above issues."
1,"Great features, bad sound quality","I received this cd player for Xmas, i was really excited about it. But when i played mi first cd, when i was listening the 7th song i heard many cracks all the entire song, i thought it was the song but when i skipped to the next track and returned the sound was fixed. I'm using the cd player for 2 months and i had to get used to skip the songs when listening to it. I think this is terrible!!! Any other user that has the same problem?"
3,hard to understand,"i just got this player, and it sounds fine, but the instructions are unclear. i really didnt like the headphones it came with, but i bought some philips foldable sport headphones, and they are totally awesome. so i give this product 3 stars. it looks good and sounds good, but the instruction manual is very unclear."
4,Awesome - for a cheap player,"I was looking for a CD player that played the radio, and was affordable. Well I found it in this player! Although it feels pretty cheap- and well, it is, it works beautifully! It's easy to use, works without a hitch, and has everything you would ever want. My only complaint is that the screen is hard to read. Otherwise I am completly satisfied with this product. I would recomend the product to people who don't want to spend a lot of money but still get a good player. If you wanted a better quality player I'm sure there are tons of other great ones but, well, you get what you pay for!"
2,Long-winded for such a thin volume...,"I would've loved to have this information more succinct & to the point, it would have made a good article...unfortunately the author obviously attempted to stretch it out & pad it, which, in my opinion makes for a frustrating read.I give it 2 stars because it does contain some useful information, if you can tolerate & get past the author's overstated & condescending writing style."
2,No spring - difficult to use.,"I needed this large size basin wrench to remove an old kitchen faucet. Unfortunately when it arrived there was no spring, which makes it very difficult to use in tight spaces. The end of the wrench just flops around so it's hard to get it to grip the nut. If you can get both your hands up there then it might work. But with one hand it's nearly impossible.The only positive of this wrench is that it is quite large, so it can work for nuts that are 2"" and larger. Other wrenches I've tried were much too small for a 2"" nut."
1,Cultural Studies of Clothing,"Do not be misled by the title of the book. This book belongs to the genre of Cultural Studies, not Social Psychology.Regadless of the thick size, the book has little content. It is full of grandiose and theory-ridden claims that our clothing is socially constructed phenomena etc., but when you read the content more carefully, you notice that the book does not give you any better understanding of clothing.Furthermore, the book contains few references to empirical studies of clothing. Most references are to other articles in Cultural Studies (why our gender is socially constructed etc).There a few nice anecdotes and examples, but that does not come even close to covering the price of this book."
2,Not a very good wii game,I had this game 1 day before I sold it on ebay. My family thought this would be a fun game but it was very boring.
3,O.k,"I don't think the game is that good. I think how you move the players, the characters is a bit too hard.When you are running, the wire between the two controls hits you. Although there is a good variety of sports and different events.Overall its okay and you will find the sport on it which will match your likings, nevertheless its quite superficial and unreal.I hardly play it because it gets boring after a while. Its not the best game I've played.I don't think you should buy it, its a bit old and there are many better games out there now."
2,More of an Olympic Qualifier,"First off, let me say that I am left handed. This game has no option to switich for lefties. I know everybody is going to think this is a bad review because its so short but... This game dosen't have bad graphics and it dosen't have glitches, its just simply not fun."
1,Only if your an only child,I bought this game for my niece and nephew who are about seven years of age. I don't know how to put the game on multi player and it says it plays up to four players. it's not so easy to understand. My niece likes it. My nephew believes it's a game and it's great. It's got trivia and all that. Just don't want to play it. I am 28. So...buy if your a gamer.
3,Didn't buy this Item...Error,"Altho this looks like a game that my grandchildren would enjoy playing on their Wii, I didn't buy this item, so I don't know why it's on my unreviewed list. It must be a data entry error..."
4,mario and sonic olympic game,Fun game for the whole family. You can always count on any mario game to be entertaining.
3,I was disappointed,"I guess I am just an oldy but I like the original Marios better than this. I found this to be difficult to play. My kids, ages 9 and 10 won't play it because it is too hard for them. But again, they are not video game buffs so it may be great for those that are."
3,It wasn't as fun as I thought it would be,I don't know. Maybe I had high expectations but this wasn't what I expected. It's a fun game at first but grows old quickly.
2,Hard for kids,This game is too hard for kids. Its impossible for the kids to win and unlock any other games. Even some of the directions were difficult to understand.I say rent this before you buy it.
3,Party game for holidays,"A perfect fit for Young ones and Party. If you are looking for a Wii game for young children, pick this one. Or if you want spend a nice fun evening with friends and family, you wont go wrong."
4,Tiring!,"This game is so much fun but I wish it was a little easier for non-fit beginners, lol. Who needs the wii fit? this game tires you out enough. FUN!"
5,Realy Fun and Family game,"My son (7 years old) just LOVE this game (first we rented it, now we bougth it); the game is very interactive and very accurate ""get out the couch""Note: On Mario games you never loose, always quality and fun time..."
4,Good Game,"This is a pretty good game, it takes a while to load up when you have more than one player, but its fun in a group. It gets you moving as well. My kids love to watch it, but it can be a little complicated for a 5 or 6 year old to try to do."
3,Be careful: this is not WINTER GAMES!,"Meant to order Mario & Sonic at the WINTER GAMES. But since this one came and I'm too cheap to pay s&h to send back, we kept it and then ordered the winter version (which is much more fun in my opinion)."
5,"Out goes the old, in comes the new!","My 1985 yamaha R-9 bit the dust and I was in need of a new stereo. I bought the R-9 25 years ago when I was in the service for 350.00 thru the AFES, it listed retail like 900.00. I have been so impressed with the 797, especially the clarity! What was even nicer is the subwoofer link so you do not have to splice in speaker wires!I highly recomend this unit! It rocks!T"
1,Winter Grief Book doesn't help,"Beware of title. I was seeking something to help me cope while I saw my Mother and Husband suffer from Terminal Illnesses and Die, but this book did not help. The title was deceiving. It's short with Poetry Sections, and I felt I wasted my time and money on this."
5,"Intelligent, touching, unique","After listening to this album and some of Crowell's others, I had the great fortune to see him perform live. He and his band are amazing. If all country music was like this I would be a die-hard country fan. His music cuts, it makes one laugh and it is human. Before I entered the performance, a man I spoke to told me he had seen Crowell move a huge, rough looking cowboy with terrifying metal tipped boots to tears with his dual songs from a southern boy dying from AIDS in Los Angeles to his brother, and then from his homophobic twin brother with a heart-felt reply where he reaches out to his dying twin. Who can ask for more?This is currently my favorite Rodney Crowell album. But if what I heard in the live performance is in his next one, he may change my mind!"
5,Nice feature to take group photos that include you,"this is a nice little remote for the pentax, works well and does what it's supposed to do."
1,Very disappointed,"Similar to the problems others have had, we've had not one but two RCD148s fail on us. The first one stopped playing CDs within a month or so, and we were able to exchange it for a new one. The second one lasted not quite a year before having the same problem. Even when they did work, MP3 playback was slow and unreliable.Given all of the problems, I'd highly recommend staying well away from this product. As for us, we won't be purchasing any more RCA products anymore."
1,"Run, don't walk away from this product.",My wife purchased this boom box for me for Christmas. Great idea! Wrong player! Fresh out of the box and FM tuner does not work at all. Tried playing a MP3 CD on it and it worked for approximately a half hour than stopped working. Now the unit does not play ANY CD at all. There is not any warranty return information with this product at all. No place to write to or any place to call for help. Seems like they knew they had a bad product.This is the second RCA product that we've purchased this year that seems to be a complete and total piece of trash. First product was a color TV that died after two months of use. RCA no longer seems to be making products of any quality. Consumers may be better off not purchasing ANY of their products. I know I will not consider purchasing any of them from now on.
1,Piece of Junk,"I purchased this portable unit to play mp3 files. I currently have a home cd/mp3 player and wanted a unit I could take with me while camping. This unit wont play ANY mp3 file I own, while my other player and even my dvd player has no problem with my mp3 discs. This unit will read the files and menu, but will not play. The display is almost impossible to read even in room lighting because RCA was too cheap to include a backlit display. This unit is going back to the store tomarrow. I wish I would of read this review forum before I bought this thing. What a waste of my time!"
1,A Major Dissappointment,"I was looking forward to the arrival of this bike so much, I thought it was going to be a great way to burn calories while doing just about anything. But when I tried it I discovered 2 things. First off your legs have to be at a 90 degree angle in order to pedal without it moving all over the place (which means you have to have an adjustable office chair or put phone books on a normal one). And when I finally get settled on it no matter how hard of a setting it's on it only burns about a calorie a minute.This bike might be great for arm workouts because it doesn't move as much on the table and it can offer a lot of resistance (though I only tried it for a few minutes) but definitely not for your legs."
4,Good little bike,"For some reason the electronic control panel doesn't work on my bike. But I don't mind too much. The bike is small and light but has enough mass so it doesn't slide around. I use the bike while doing work, watching TV or reading. It's a great way to get exercise on rainy days."
3,trip hop,"I BOUGHT THIS CD THINKING IT WAS THE 70'S ROCK BAND,BUT IT WASN'T.THIS CD IS A REAL GOOD COMBINATION OF TRIP HOP(PORTISHEAD ECT..)JAZZ AND ROCK.THE VOCALS ARE GOOD AND THE MUSIC IS RECORDED EXCELLENTLY.MY ONLY PROBLEM WITH THIS CD IS THE LYRICS ARE VERY REPETITIVE AND DROLL.OTHER THAN THAT THIS CD WAS A REFRESHING MISS-BUY."
5,Beautiful,"This is a really beautiful and peaceful collection of music. It's the sort of thing that's great to listen to when you want to relax after work, or as background music while relaxing."
2,Very British,"Not a bad little British film. It features some very good period costuming, good acting, particularly by actor Paul Bettany, plus well written story (it is afterall Robert Lewis Stevenson). My biggest complaint are the dark scenes, which make everything hard to see, especially the fight scenes. In addition, for a DVD, there are very few extras included, which would been nice to have. In short, it's not bad, but could have been better."
4,Very good,"I was not a fan of this author's previous book. I thought it was somewhat juvenile.Dead Stone came out and I thought I would give the author another try.I am glad that I did. While the main character can be a little silly, I loved the whole plot line in this book.Her interaction with the townspeople (who do not realize she is ""one of them"") is priceless. I especially liked her connection with Hank.The writing is somewhat basic, but the story is told at a fairly good pace and you end up really liking this book. The main character's relationship with her dog also adds to this book.Buy it."
3,Doesn't have a great range,"I purchased this router to go with my cable box that provides phone, internet and cable to my house. The cable box is in the basement so I purchased this router so the signal would carry to the 2nd floor office. Other comments and reviews said this router could carry a signal further, but I found NO DIFFERENCE from other routers that I have purchased. It is a comparable to other routers, but doesn't carry further or offer anything 'above and beyond' as I had expected."
1,No Blu-Ray!!!,"I Hope There Is A Blu-Ray Release.-I Really Enjoyed The First Box, But It looks like Funimation is pulling movies.They Cancelled Dragonball Z Blu-Ray, now they want to cancel other Movies Too.-Funimation, I Am Very Disappointed With Your Progress-"
2,Caution - Purse sized mirror,"I travel a lot & need a good magnifying mirror to apply my makeup in the hotels. I had one that was about 6"" diameter but it broke so I ordered this one. The description didn't state the size of the mirror (unless I missed it somewhere) but by the look of the picture I assumed it would be about the same size as my old one. Be forewarned - this is a very small mirror - more like purse size. I had to return it.The low rating is not a reflection on the quality of the product - just that it would've been nice to have known in advance that it was very small."
1,Does not transfer pictures,"I purchased this cable in the hopes that it would transfer data (since it's a data cable...) off of my old RazR. However, all it would do once hooked up to the computer was charge. So now I have another cable that doesn't fit anything else I have. :("
2,No Data,"I got this item for my Motorola phone so I could transfer data from the phone to my computer, but the only thing it would do is charge. I installed the software for Motorola phone management for this and the cable still only charged the phone without any data transfer."
4,It Works. What Else Is There to Say?,"The cable works as advertise and fits into the charging port sturdily. It's not very long though, maybe 2-3 feet, barely fits from my computer's USB port to the desktop."
5,Needs CD to function.,Arrived quickly. Exactly as described. I had ordered A CD with Motorola phone tools at the same time so was able to communicate between my phone and computer. A little tricky but it does the job.
1,Completely Disappointing,"This book is a rambling disjointed unconnected hodgepodge of ideas.Like creating a Chullent, the author tries to make a blend but the book falls apart.Having just finished the book, I feel soiled. I want my money back. I want to toss it in the trash as a total and complete waste of time."
5,A life long Bibical Researcher.,This DVD is very accurate. I saw this documentary once a long time ago and liked it. I was happy to see it available in DVD. I check all the verses that the DVD refers to and they are correct. It opened my eyes that there is more to prophecy than what I have been taught. The filming is brilliant and the narrator is easily understood. I recommend this DVD to anyone who is not satisfied with what they have been told to expect in the end days. You will be surprised how many prophecies have already come true. A must see to believe.
4,harbinger gloves,product is very good but like to see a little more padding in the palm and proximal phlanges (fingers) for those of us that need the extra cushion to reduce bone spurs and knots
2,Good if it's free,"Got this as a promotion from Amazon with Maxxum 5, and was surprised and amused to find out it's even weaker than the build in flash(GN is base on ISO 200, you need to divide by 1.4 to get the real number). So the only use is when you got a long lense, the higher positioned external flash won't cast the shadow of the lens on your baby's face as the build in flash will.On the bright side, the flash is very compact and comes with a carrying case and it uses the same battery as the camera, so I may keep it just in case, as a backup flash and a battery storage."
2,"Decent code examples; however, they are poorly explained","This book has some good examples of using Visual Basic 6.0 and the various data access techniques, etc...However, the book reminds me more of a shopping list with it's individual check marks; than a clearly written educational manual."
4,"Clear, to the point","Great for basic stuff, but could use more details for the more complex stuff, like three-way or four-way switches. Progression is not ""linear"" from basic to advanced. Also, could use a troubleshooting section."
2,"No sleep, little power, limited, shaky?","This card, using a TI chipset, has always been annoying.My son saw a lot of mysterious firewire issues with devices connected through the card, though we were never able to pin down the culprit.While advertised as compatible with a wide range of machines and systems, it is a 5 volt only PCI card, limiting it to older hardware.At least on my example of the card, F5U503 Rev.S-3, there is no internal power connector, limiting the useful capacity to one bus powered device, e.g. iPod or 2.5"" hard disk, but not both at once. This is not an issue if you plan to use 3.5"" or 5"" firewire drives which have their own power supplies.The failure to support deep sleep is the most infuriating aspect of the card. Macs are competent and reliable sleepers, going months before rebooting. The Belkin card prevents deep sleep, something I only learned on the Belkin support site long after I bought the card.Whether for PC or Mac, I'll choose more carefully next time."
1,A pathetic apologia,"A blind, flag waving pile of nonsense. Highly inaccurate in it's history, it serves as an apologia for imperialism, racism, slavery and genocide. This pathetic tract is a waste of the paper it's printed on. Save the trees and wait for the Disney cartoon version."
1,pure propaganda for the far-right crowd,"This book is garbage. Pure garbage.It is nothing but far-right propaganda.It is endorsed, not by any literary or historical specialists, but by college drop-out propagandists like Beck and Limbaugh. Of course they endorse it - they never got a decent grade in school as it was. Two hucksters that recognize another huckster in it for the big bucks and the flim-flam of the populace for personal gain.This book is a pure LIE and anyone who reads it is only wanting to be fed the same nasty, bigoted lies they believe in already. Sounds a lot like the Republican party of 2010 these days."
1,"Makes you wish there was a ""0 stars"" option","How this even got published is just beyond me. This is absolutely the most incredibly ignorant history book I've ever read. Actually, I think it would be better termed ""revisionist"" history.Don't misunderstand me, history books are often innaccurate and disagree, but this tome can best be described as a fantasy version of US history that will appeal to the most rabid instincts of the average knuckle-dragging Limbaugh/Fox News fan. I'd honestly never even conceived of a partisan American History book.One simple example would be using the rather unsubstantiated and implausible theories of the book ""Silent Coup"" where G. Gordon Liddy becomes a noble hero and John Dean is the sole catalyst of Watergate.I don't know whether I should laugh or cry."
5,Patriots History of the United States,"This book is informative and extremely interesting. Every household in the United States should have one so that when our history is being rewritten by the Progressives, we will access to the truth! I am planning on getting one for each of my children's homes."
1,"""A Republican's History of the United States""","This work is remarkable more for what it leaves out than what it includes in its panoramic, though tendentious, sweep of US history. The reader realizes in the opening passages that the authors intend to refute Howard Zinn's ""A People's History,"" but in their zeal, they have written a book that would not pass muster as a dissertation in any doctoral program in the country; this book would not survive a scholarly peer review from detached professional American historians. The book reminds this reader of the triumphalistic, party-line, national histories written for children in the former Warsaw Pact nations and the Soviet Union in the Breschnev era."
3,the RIGHT perspective,"A good reference but a bit dry of a read. It tells the American history in a way Americans can be rightfully proud. We already knew we were far from perfect, but what did we do that was good?"
5,"A Patriot's History is a fantastic book that is not politically correct but full of actual facts of history, It is awesome!",A Patriot's History of the United States is the best compilation I have seen to date. It is factual and well written.
2,Actualy Unpatriatic,"By turning a blind eye to our Nation's faults and mistakes, the author becomes as culpible as the man who allows his brother to drift into alcholism without ever confronting him. it is not unpatriotic to point out our nation's mistakes when they are made. Quite the contrary, it is the most patriotic excercise one can engage in."
5,An excellent reference,This is an excellent reference and textbook. It provides a more balanced look at American History than many popular textbooks that seem to have an anti-American bias. This is the text that should be used in most of our history classes today. Every history teacher and school administrator should read and review this book BEFORE ordering his or her history textbooks. It would also be good reading for everybody else to correct misinformation they may have been taught in school. Highly recommended!
3,Entertaining but have to check accuracy,"I enjoyed reading the book immensely, but one has to check the accuracy of remarks and question due diligence on the part of the authors. As an example, on page 618 while describing the 'Battle of the Bulge' the authors describe how the General Anthonly McAuliffe and his 82d Airborne Division held out while isolated in the town of Bastogne. This actually took place by the 101st Airborne Division, depicted the Stephen Ambrose rendition of 'Band of Brothers.' At the Arlington National Cemetary website, [...] there is a description of the heroics associated with General McAuliffe. For the hundreds of thousands of soldiers who have served in the two divisions, this is a pretty big gaffe and one that a little research diligence would have avoided."
3,Facts are wrong,"While I generally liked this book (audio book), I was very disappointed in the authors' incorrect facts. In one glaring error, the authors' mention (three times) that the 82nd Airborne Division was trapped at Bastogne, France, in 1944. It was the 101st Airborne Division and the authors' should have known that as the Screaming Eagles (101st) are famous for that battle. If they miss that simple fact, how credible is the rest of the book? Another misstatement was that all three astronauts of Apollo 11 ""set foot on the moon"" but we all know that Michael Collins orbited the moon while Armstrong and Aldrin landed."
1,The worst C.D. buy a cajujn artist,"It is the worst music I heard all year.All the other cd's by Steve Riley have been great.Hopefully he will stick to traditional cajun music.We need people like him to carry it on into the future,and to make sure it dosent die.The whole cd was bad! Dewey Balfa and other great musicans would not be proud."
4,A great little pot for backpackers,"The MSR Titan kettle is exactly the right size for a double-size freeze-dried meal, a couple of packs of ramen, a Lipton's meal, or enough hot water to make a single meal and have a hot beverage. There's an indentation on the bottom that keeps it stable on a cat food or soda can alcohol stove. The lid fits snugly so it doesn't fall off and it might even save you from losing your dinner if you knock it over. It will hold the stove and a windscreen when packing it up, plus your lighter and a spoon. The spout is very handy and the handles fold against the body. It's lightweight, too.There are three drawbacks: the high price, it's hard to clean when making meals with creamy sauces as they tend to stick, and the handles get hot so you have to either let them cool or use a bandana.Overall it's probably the best little backpacking pot there is if you can spare the bucks."
4,Good Value for the Price!,I bought this one because my previous tv was a Toshiba. I was not disapointed. Picture and Sound are very good but why is the remote so small? I'm afraid I will lose it. They could have included a slightly larger universal remote but I'm pretty happy with it. Very good value for the low price!
3,I like Giulini with Accardo much better,"I agree with the reviewer here who writes, ""Perlman's Beethoven is technically sound, and in tune. It is not, however, bold, exciting, unique, or interesting."" And I find Giulini's accompaniment too cautious and reverential. Where's the drama?The Beethoven concerto is a warhorse that also hapens to be a masterpiece, and like the Fifth Sym., we've heard it a hundred times--it needs something fresh to come to life. Perlman and Giulini don't provide that. It's as if they wnated to mkae an officially great document for posterity.I much prefer Giulini's Sony recording with Salvatore Accardo, who plays with soulful Romaantic ocnviction, not the only approach to Beethoven but better than what we hear on this CD."
1,Eye Socket bone universal?,"Its is obviously not so. The goggles would not fit my Asian eye socket bone structure at all! The manufacturer should at least qualify that this suits the Caucasian bone structure of the eye socket only!""Positive Pressure means comfort - without suction, pain or marks. The underlying frame of Barracuda Positive Pressure swim goggles ts the bone structure of the eye socket. While facial anatomy can vary, the eye socket is relatively the same. Barracuda's frames match the contours and curvature of the eye socket. In addition, Barracuda uses an ultra-soft, closed-cell sponge to seal against the skin. This material closes any gaps that remain between the frame of the goggle and the face. By applying this patented technology, Barracuda Positive Pressure goggles are able to seal out water without painful suction."""
1,:(,this isn't what i was expecting i was hoping for something more advance i love dancing if this is your first belly dancing dvd then it might be okay for you but i could think of better ones to start with i wouldn't recommend buying this pack of dvd's at all
2,Bellydance,I thought these videos provided clear and easy to follow instructions. The videos were tastefully put together which made it enjoyable to watch as well as to follow along.
2,Disgraceful pseudo-scholarly translation of a great book,"Schenker's first major work, a brilliant accomplishment, but only in the German. Sadly, over a quarter of the text and over 70 musical examples have been excised from the original, in this so-called scholarly edition/translation--a hatchet job presumably carried out by the editor Oswald Jonas, to bring the book into line with Schenker's later work. Amazingly, even this travesty is still a pretty good harmony book, but it's not a patch on the original. Read the German, if you can find it!"
2,Way too brief,Way too brief and incomplete. I didn't find it helpful. Best use it as a guide and do your own research on-line.
5,An excellent book. Both informative and very entertaining.,"The book put forth the travels of Alfred Wallace in a most entertaining mannner and gave a very useful synopsis of theories dealing with island biogeography. The book is both exquisitly detailed, yet very understandable. His tales of extinction show the impact humans have made on the natural world through their direct and indirect actions. The book shows how this impact has caused great losses in biodiversity and how it has brought forth massive amounts of ecoystem decay. The author's own travels and experiences make for a informative and entertaining book that is a great reference material."
3,"Not gripping, yet interesting","Granted I rarely read non-fiction, I found this book rather boring and only struggled to read it because I am utterly interested in the subject matter. I read a little over half of it before finally giving up. The writing was just too disjointed, divided in too many little stories that I struggled to connect, given very few hints of what the author's point was. In my opinion, the style was a little too personal for reporting scientific information, and the obsession of the author with degrading Charles Darwin whenever he got a chance was also a turnoff. However, I have to admit that there's a lot of work put into this book, based on the bibliography alone, and it contains a lot of interesting and important information, if you can wade through it."
5,You Must Buy This Book and Give Copies to Friends,"""The Song of the Dodo"" is one of the best natural history books I have ever read. It is seldom that I have ploughed through such a mammoth doorstop of a book and been disappointed that it came to an end so early. Quammen is a wonderful writer, wrestling with some complex subjects here, and the lucky reader ends up with several different books, including one on the history of biology, another on biogeography and biodiversity, yet another on travel and even a eulogy on Tasmanians. As someone with a strong interest in wildlife conservation, I found this book fascinating and alarming. I liked it so much that I bought all of Quammen's other books of essays. They too are very enjoyable, but ""Song of the Dodo"" is an absolute must-read if you care about the natural world."
4,Hot D@mn!,"I recently got 200 Licks Country Style together with 200 Licks Jazz Style. Neither one has a booklet, and the notation on the screen- while clear- is in TABLATURE! However, for country guitar that's not quite as big a drawback as it is with jazz, so I gave this DVD one additional star. The running time is substantial- on the order of two-and-a-half hours!- so you get lots of bang for the buck, and the licks are taught by FOUR (you read right, four!) top notch Nashville pickers. No complaints there. However, if you're trying to LEARN country guitar, I'd start with Country Guitar in Six Weeks by Steve Travato, a six DVD series that is spot on for most people. THEN get 200 Licks Country Style."
2,Odd reviews,"Odd reviews. Go over to the Skype forums reviews and this product get's very poor to worst reviews. This is a group, I assume is technically competent and has used, or tried to use, the KX-TGA575S for a while."
4,a little fabrication neede,"All good, except, one support bracket had to have a refabed bend in the other direction so it would fit."
4,Spiritually uplifting,"Being familiar with the Serenity Prayer, I found this expanding on the meaning fulfilling and extremely insightful. It makes a wonderful gift for friends who want to have a more meaningful understanding of life. Thanks."
5,One of the Best TV shows Ever!,"This is a must have for any fan of fantasy love stories. Very whimsical, comical. Beautifully filmed and creatively written."
4,Delightfully quirky!,"We can all use the occasional dab of silliness to our somewhat routine lives. Pushing Daisies does the trick. Fun,unpredictable and implausible story lines. An hourly escape from reality."
5,"Innovative and insightful, amusing and unexpected","Pushing Daisies is, literally, fabulous. It throws twists and new directions constantly at the viewer so that they are left in constant anticipation of what comes next. At the same time, it is warm at an emotional level yet not syrupy - rather it reveals insights into how people actually think set in a fantastic context to make those observations easier to contemplate.A great piece of television. Hats off to those who created the show and here's hoping they go far!"
1,Depends on Taste,I can see how people love the show but it was not my cup of tea. I loved the main character's acting and he was a delight to watch :) but the show never hooked me in and counting down to the second was fairly annoying. It is an acquired taste show so if you haven't seen it before I would rent the first disk or watch a clip on You Tube before you spend your money.
5,So glad I discovered this show!,"I'm on the last disc of Season 1 and I have to say that I am in love with this show. I'm sad they only made 2 seasons of it.I was however disappointed with the condition of the product that was supposed to be ""like new"". The inside of the case that held the discs was broken. I was a little peeved at the seller for that."
2,Stretches that don't stretch...,"This video contains three 10-minutes stretch routines, one standing, one sitting on a chair and one on the floor. The standing routine is a pretty basic set of stretches. They do the job. I found that except for the stretches (such as triceps) that are the same in all three, the sitting and floor stretches were useless. I am not especially flexible but even so I did not feel a stretch on most of the moves. I suppose the tape might work if you have very limited range-of-motion or have done no physical activity at all in a very long time. Overall, this tape is a waste of time and money."
5,roots rock at its best,"It doesn't get any better than the Grandsons. Fun, mambowie (is that a word), rockabillyish. This cd is worth the price of admission"
5,You can have those abs!,"I bought this video after reading good things on an online message board. The first time I tried it I hurt sooo badly the next day and I blamed it on the short warm up. Didn't try it again for a while. Eventually I decided to give it another go after doing another exercise video (it is only 15 mins) for extra warm up. It was a struggle to do, but I kept with it and I've seen results after only a couple of weeks - which is inspiring me to keep going. No more hurting even without extra warm up - I really just was that unfit. Now I know where my ab muscles are and they work! Try this video, stick with it (it *does* get easier) and you won't be disappointed!"
4,It is tough for beginners.,It is tough but I really like it. I am a beginner and have trouble with some of the exercises in the first segment. I do enjoy how she reminds one of good posture and concentration during the exercises.
5,Works Perfectly!,"""Converts a 2.5-millimeter mono plug to a 3.5-millimeter mono plug""I have several ""vintage"" Olympus microphones that are 2.5mm jacks, and this PA-3 Plug works great when I use it to plug them into my DM-520. I was previously using a cheap Stereo 2.5mm to 3.5mm plug, but for some reason I would get loud, annoying, static noises every now and then, thus ruining my recordings. But with the PA-3, no static!"
5,Paglia Does It Again,"Paglia is a major breath of fresh air. First encountered her work in of all places a neuro-psych's office in SF and rushed out to buy her books. I can see why some women who profess to be feminists hate her, because she cuts to core and challenges readers to look at the big picture past and present. It is no easy read, as you may find yourself reading a chapter then setting the book down to think for awhile. But it is a book that will not only grab your attention but will cause you to search out the other authors she speaks of like Nietzsche,Bronte,Dickinson, Oscar Wilde,and Rousseau. Not to mention she will peak your interest in drag queens, catholic saints and a montly crew of other wonders. This is a must read for the literate amongst us."
5,College campus murder makes an exciting read,"Most of our reading group, Once Around the Mall, attended colleges, both small and large, and joined sororities. So it was easy for us to relate to ""Every First Saturday."" The author's description of attracting pledges during rush week and campaigning for the Delta's homecoming queen candidate brought back memories. Most of us also remember being acquainted with someone like the victim, an unscrupulous conniver. Everyone in the reading group admitted being surprised at the ending and who the killer turned out to be. We also wonder if the author will ever have Brady Kincaid investigate the twenty-year old unsolved murder still on the books. Should make another interesting story."
2,Not recommended,"This CD is no longer recommended because the recent revelations about its being a ""reconstructed"" version of Furtwangler's Bayreuth concert. Now, you can purchase a far better version of that historic concert - in all aspects - on ORFEO. Don't buy this one."
4,"a great recording, meaby the greatest","I've heard Beethoven many time, his 7th Symphony was the first work of classical music I ever heard, and specially his two masterworks (the Missa and this Symphony) are my favourites. I've heard many, many versions... from Weingartner (that's a good one too), Toscanini, 3 from Furtwangler, a lot of others in mono, Klemperer, Böhm... a lot, meaby 50 or so, Gardiner too. OK, and then, I choose this version... it's the greatest of all... first the sence of ocassion is tremendous, the orchestra (I~ don't speek from the<input type=hidden name="
2,"Great historic occassion, not a great recording","This is a recording to get for 2 reasons. First, you have to have it because of its historic significance. Second, it reveals the slower way the symphony used to be played. I was greatly disappointed listening to the recording while following along with the score. It was slow which was O.K., but the third movement dragged on forever. I was disappointed that the strings drowned out the woodwinds most of the symphony. When the strings were going full tilt, you couldn't hear much else but them. Furtwangler didn't like the recording set up, but some how got talked into getting it recorded any way. Listening to this and you can hear why. I realize that this recording was made in the early 50's, but EMI is really reaching to call this a great recording of the 20th Century."
2,they shed worse than my cat,"These socks are so soft that they feel great on my feet but they are not at all warm. Also, they leave a little trail of fuzz all over the carpet. So if you don't like following yourself around with a vacuum cleaner, don't buy them."
2,Defective product,"Upon reading the reviews, I thought that this was the perfect tv for a 2nd home. When I went to hook up a combination DVD/VCR to the tv, I was having problems with the sound from the DVD player. I had to connect the sound into two different input jacks to get sound from the DVD portion AND the VCR portion of the combo player. Later, I realized when I was trying to connect the satellite, the entire back panel where the inputs go was defective. In other words, there must have been a loose connection.Long story short, I had to jerry-rig the inputs to get adequate sound from all sources.This tv is in a location that is rather a pain in the neck to try to get fixed so, I'm kinda stuck with it.As for the picture, it's pretty good for a relatively inexpensive set."
1,This was a dud!,"I received this television with high hopes, based on the other glowing reviews I read here. But this tv must have been a lemon, because after two hours of trying to set it up (explicitly following the directions in the user's manual), I got neither sound nor a picture. It is being returned today."
2,Boring...,"I want to begin by saying that I am typically good with workout DVDs. I have in the past used DVDs with almost religious regularity (by another instructor). However, this one was a waste of money b/c I don't feel drawn to it at all. I think some people might benefit from it but I need an instructor who's more alive (e.g. Sharon Mann from fit tv). I need a bit more engagement, more people perhaps to break up the monotony and definitely better music. If these are no issues for you, then you will be fine with this DVD b/c I think she knows what she is talking about. It's just *dull*."
5,Actually works,"I've tried a lot of different workout DVDs and find that I only wind up using a very select few. I purchased this one a couple of months ago and it is now in that short list of favorites. After doing pilates for 2 years I am still incredibly sore after the Abs workout section. The buns workout is killer, and I feel sore for days afterwards, especially if I add weights. This is not an easy video but it's worth pushing yourself to finish each segment since it yields results."
5,Very Effective Workout,"Tamilee gives excellent instructions and explains how the exercise helps. Each 15 min. part goes really fast. The movements can be challenging, but it helps knowing why they are good to do and struggle doing them. I can see how this can be an effective addition to anyone's program. You can adjust the level of difficulty so this is appropriate for beginners to advanced. I highly recommend it and I'm an intermediate level exerciser. I get a good workout."
3,Not my cup of Tea,"This workout wasn't for me. It's too much like a typical gym-class workout for my taste, while I much prefer the style of the Pilates or ""8 Minute Abs"" dvd series. It's all a matter of subjective tastes, like how some people who are more prude prefer the ""New Free Sex"" dvd over the more outrageous ""New Sex Now"" dvd, but in that case I prefer the sexier one, while in this case with the workouts, I want the less energized version offered by Pilates."
5,Well worth whatever you paid for it,"Sometimes I hate slow, repetive exercises, but I still do these workouts because each is only 15 minutes so I know I can get through it. Plus the exercises have been tested and really work. The first time I did the abs one session, I was sore for the next three days! Some of these 15 minute workouts get me sweating more than some of my cardio tapes! I also think Tamilee is not annoying but quite pleasant and informative. I'm so pleased with this purchase. This DVD gets heavy play in my workout rotation."
2,not one of tamilee's best ;-(,"brand new tape (2001)....this tape was not what i expected...i thought it was an aerobic workout or at least a workout video but it is two 15 minute target toning sessions combining arms, abs, legs, buns all together.if you have her indivisual tapes like buns of steele, abs of steele, and thighs of steele, then stick with those. this tape has alot harder moves and tons of lunges which are kind of stenous to my knees. one thing i did like, however, is that it involves using weights when toning your arms. its not the worst tape but it's definitely not the best."
2,Appliqué and material very scratchy on baby!,"I received this hooded towel as a gift at my baby shower and I have to say I am not very impressed with it. It feels very cheap and the appliqué in the hooded part is terrible! Agree that the material is more absorbent than others I have but I have to say the towels I have found to work best on baby are the ones I use for the shower! Baby towels are cute but function wise, save your $$ and just buy some super absorbent regular bath towels. They are all over soft for baby and work best!"
4,Definitely a two person operation here! lol,"Two sets of hands are definitely needed for this apartaus to work properly. lol. I was sooo excited to play with it, but it didn't work out obviously.For her, it doesn't stay in and it doesn't do much vibrating at all like the balls inside knocking together are suposed to. Being the adventurous types, we thought we'd try it the other way. lol. Well, the other way was just to akward and impossible to accomplish!I think the trick is not to use too much lube! The string could be helpful if it were longer, or made of a harder material... I don't know. Just not the pleasent experience we were look forward to. Akward and uncomfortable, all three times we gave it a try."
4,Contemporary Californian poetry,"This collection offers a glimpse of what goes on at the Beyond Baroque poetry evening, one of LA's best-known poetry workshops. The poems it contains cover a number of styles and subjects, from the erotic to the amusing, and this variety means you're likely to find something that appeals to you whatever your taste. I was pleased to see that the volume contained four prose pieces from Ron Bloom, which for me were the highlight of the collection. I also particularly enjoyed pieces by Ruth Wire, Sarah Maclay, and a poem on pain/death by Jessica Pompei.If you've read many of LA's literary magazines you'll probably know some of these authors; if not, you'll discover new voices you'll want to hear more from. This is a volume worth exploring."
4,B-Side here!,"Until November of 2007, this CD is the onlly place you can get the b-side ""All The Pretty Faces"" (unless you bought ""Sam's Town"" at Best Buy the week it was released). This is a great song. It will be released on their b-sides album ""Sawdust"" in November of this year. If you can wait, then buy the B-sides record."
2,42H83 TOSHIBA LEMON,"OK SET, I BOUGHT IT BECAUSE IT WAS THE BEST LOOKING PICTUREFOR THE PRICE. ABOUT 6 MOS. AFTER WARRANTY WAS OUT THE PICTUREBECAME VERY WAVY AND STARTED FLASHING. HAD TO TAKE TO A SERVICECENTER AND WAS TOLD THE MAIN BOARD WAS OUT AND IT WAS OUT OFWARRANTY.( THE MAIN BOARD WAS BAD AND PARTS WERE NOT SERVICEABLE CALLED TOSHIBA, AND AFTER EXPRESSING MY CONCERNS THAT THIS SHOULDN'T OF HAPPENED SO SOON THEY AGREED TO PAY FOR PART $300+ AND ALL I HAD TO PAY WAS LABOR $100. GREAT. UNIT WORKED OK FOR17 MONTHS AND NOW THE PICTURE IS ACTING UP AGAIN. THE GREENCOLOR WON'T ADJUST AND THE TOUCH FOCUS SYSTEM SAYS ""ERROR""WHEN WE TRY TO USE IT. THE PROBLEM IS AFTER LOOKING ONLINE ALLBIG SCREENS SEEM TO HAVE THEIR SHARE OF PROBLEMS.ON INTERESTING THING TO NOTE IS THAT THERE ARE COOLING HOLESON THE BOTTOM OF THE SET AND WHEN IT SITS ON THE CARPET THEYARE COVERED UP AND I'M SURE LED TO THE DEMISE OF THE ORIGINALCIRCUIT BOARD . I HAVE THE UNIT NOW SITTING ON A BOARD SOTHESE HOLES ARE NOT COVERED."
5,BEAUTIFUL ORIGINAL,"WITH EVERYONE SINGING STANDARDS (EVEN ROD STEWART) IT IS VERY REFRESHING TO LISTEN TO THESE SONGS BY ONE OF THE ""ORIGINALS"" OF THE ERA. JO STAFFORD'S VOICE COME THROUGH WITH VERY HIGH QUALITY IN THESE REMASTERED RECORDINGS. I WISH I COULD SEE HER PERFORM LIVE."
2,Pass on this one,"Don't be fooled like I was. This CD has only 11 tunes from the movie,totally missing some of my favorites like Chunari Chunari, which is what I wanted the CD for. The 'other' Monsoon Wedding CD has 19 tunes, a better buy than this. I completely wasted my money on this one. Was the title here deceptive?"
3,good starter,Got this because a co worker said it was easy to use and it is. Only problem is that once the memory is completely full you can't seem to open it to delete stuff off so you hopefully like everything on there
4,Samsung YP-U2JZW,"This is a great product for those of us who like to listen to radio while on our daily walk/run. Although other products may be more trendy, this is very useful."
2,Media Player won't recognized the device,"After only a few months I am having the same problems with the YP-U2J that everyone else seems to be having where the device isn't recognized but still charges. I googled and found a link to some fixes. Haven't tried it yet, but plan to. Here is the link to cnet:[...]Good luck."
4,So far so good,I like the set-up of the book. It is easy to follow and gives great tools and tips for getting a good score. The book gives you the toughest possible test questions to study. The only section that is confusing and not as thorough would be the math section.
4,Excellent book,"I only read the table of contents and skimmed the first few chapters. Based on that, though, I can say that anyone who is considering leading a certification program should read this book. The checklist at the end of Chapter 1 is itself worth the price of the book. Outlines four simple things that have to happen at the beginning of a good certification program."
5,Jacky Faber Triumphs Again,"Up front, I have to say that I'm 40 years old and read all types of books. I started the series about a month ago and have read the first four books in record time.I like them all, but this one had so much more depth than the others and inspired me to write a review.The content is a little more serious than the previous books, but seemed in character with what they had to go through on the ship, living by their wits and what they could do/use to rescue themselves since no one else was there to help.This is what Lord of the Flies could have been if they had a common purpose rather than fighting amongst themselves. I liked that wasn't seamlessly easy for them to get off the ship.It brought a few tears to my eyes at the end... And it ended in true Jacky style. My library only has these four books so I might have to buy them, which wouldn't be bad."
4,Like it,Easy to use straight or curl hair. Doesn't heat up the same as other infrashines that I've tried. I do recommend this product if you are looking to buy a straightner.
3,"Amazing straightener, but...","I bought this product last spring and right after I got it, it work amazingly. My hair was perfectly straight, even though naturally it is very thick and curly. It used to take me over 20 minutes to straighten my hair and then it only took me 6 or 7. However, now that I have had it for a little over a year, it has started to burn out and now it takes me about 20 minutes again and it is not as straight as I would like it to be. I have not taken care of it perfectly and it has been dropped a few times, but the period of time where it worked the best was in the first 6 months or so and then it started dying out.Overall, this is a great straightener, just know that the first results you get from it don't last for very long."
3,Half and Half,"I find this to be one of the most intellectual movies of all time. However, there is some modest exposure to this film that kind of evens it out , therefore I gave it half the amount of available stars. Quite a monumental film dispite its shortcomings"
5,Unbelievable!,"Berezovsky does it again. Amazing, stunning...most glorious recording of the Totentanz I have ever heard. Every note is packed with suspense, emotion, drama. The orchestra is also perfect. No complaints at all about this album."
3,Yum yum,"Government-sponsored cannibalism. Just not possible--our politicos aren't that smart/devious/sneaky/adept/clever. Bizarre tale. Oh, and I forgot to mention that completely debriding a human of his skin is incompatible with life and further speaking. yeah, just gross."
2,Not that great,"DVD came on time and was in acceptable condition. I would order from this seller again in the future. I would not recommend this product to others, because I did not think it was very helpful. The content of the film was not helpful and I did not find it to be useful in preparation for labor."
3,A Horrendous Heap Indeed,"This a review of the book set and not the stories which are quite good.The good: All the books are hard cover, the cover art is lovely, the cover look and feel is glossy, all the books - save the last - are in one place in four separate box sets.The horrendous: Once you open the books - that is, get past the covers - the quality of the books is VERY disappointing. The inner pages are not properly cut, the paper feels cheap and the edges are frayed. I would almost think this was a marketing ploy - given the relative darkness of the stories and the fact that things never go quite the way they should - but sadly this is unlikely. Even if it were, it would have failed miserably. The books simply feel cheap.And on the ""to be fair"" side: Divide $90 by 12 and you'll see that we are purchasing hard cover books at less than $8 per book. Could not expect much better than what we've paid for. :-)Ah well. At least the stories are good."
2,Not a very powerful fragrant,the amount of liquid in this container will scent a cotton ball! its very watered down scent. I do not recommend this product for any type of 'scenting' other than maybe putting it on a cotton ball and adding the cotton ball to your dresser drawer.. Very disappointed and will not purchase again
4,A great supplement for arcane casters,"This book is full of great prestige classes, a few really cool classes, and several feats and new spells. The best feature is really the classes and prestige classes. Warlock and warmage are two new classes that let you do things many wizards or sorcerers have dreamed of - cast all day, as many times as you want (Warlock), or wear armor to save your own skin while hurling that lightning bolt or fireball (warmage). It also has an extremely good assortment of creative prestige classes, some so cool that I changed the direction of at least one of my characters so they could take a prestige class from this book.Overall, a great supplement for anyone that likes to play an arcane caster a lot or wants to try one of a different kind."
1,Junk,Car charger is a piece of junk. I should have not taken chances even after reading reviews. So here I am too also advising not to buy.
2,low quality,"I got this two months ago. It was ok for a little while, then the car charger broke after around 5 uses. Not recommand it if you need to use the car charger a lot."
1,Bad company practices,"This software is good at filtering spam. However, I have two major beefs with them.When I bought the software, they signed me up for one of their newsletters W2Knews without giving the option not to sign up. I find it incredible that a software company who develops a program to eliminate spam, would sign me up for SPAM when I bought it.Also, you may notice that they add their own domains -- sunbelt-software.com, w2knews.com, winxpnews.com, wxpnews.com to your ""friends"" list when you install. Seems like a pretty shady practice to me.I'm still in shock that they would do this."
5,Historical Fiction,"Being a middle school teacher, I have always enjoyed historical fiction. All those who loved Downton Abbey would also enjoy Foyles War. Masterpiece Theater has produced the best actors and actresses. I have often felt that the British schools have been exemplary in their elocution lessons. Colin Firth as a king who stuttered is an example of this. American schools are negligent in that they do not teach our students correct speech. As in the play, Pygmalian, we see the philosophy of speech patterns stymying progress. Proficiency in speech enables progress in every field, especially politics."
1,HOW DO YOU PLAY IT?????,"I was so excited I sent this ordered this present from Amsterdam to be delivered to Asuncion for my niece who lives in Cairo, to find out you need something else to play this toy, WHAT? I am looking all over and can't find the main toy you use to play these Music Cartridges? PLEASE somebody tell me what is it and where do I buy it? Can't find it in Amazon; no warning, no advise, no suggestion. HELP!!!"
1,I was misled,"When I ordered this toy, there was nothing to indicate that I need another part for this to be used. I only found out when I got it and now I cannot find the other part. It is totally useless unless you have both components."
1,Sola Fad,"Promise Keepers, Prayer Of Jabez, Purpose Driven,...Captured By Grace. How many of these Band Wagons are we going to jump on ?How about the GOSPEL !!!"
5,Freedom is Slavery,"David Jeremiah's book 'Captured by Grace,' is simple wonderful. Short, but packed full of the truth of God's word and anecdotes from the lives of his men (particularly John Newton, as the cover implies), this book is a must read (especially at the low, prime-eligible, paperback price - although I have the book in hardback, which may be worthwhile for its staying power).Dr. David Jeremiah compares the lives of John Newton (the slave trader turned preacher/hymnist who wrote 'Amazing Grace') with the Apostle Paul (the persecutor turned Christian who, in terms of bulk of the New Testament, comes second only to Luke). What results is a clear, readable and challenging story about how to leave slavery to sin and enter into freedom through slavery to Christ. You will love it."
4,captured by grace,What a great book...I did find it slow in going but the information is really good. I learned a lot about some things I didn't know and I also learned some NEW things about some things I did know about! Does that make any sense at all?I find Dr Jeremiah very knowledgeable and full of God's grace. He is a superb Bible teacher and his Bible studies are so easy to follow and comprehend. This little book is no different.
1,disappointed,I was influenced to purchase this by some glowing reviews written by other people. I have only played it once as I am so disappointed. The only pieces I enjoy are the Gibbons and Tallis songs. The rest is not to my taste. The group sing well but I am sorry I bought it.
4,smells good,"When you buy this perfume for your girlfriend, don't tell her it was under 40 dollars! I don't know why people make a big deal over expensive perfume. Yeah, like it really smells better just because it's more expensive. Anyway, Sarah Jessica Parker perfume has a really nice scent that you'll want to smell over and over. It's nice that you don't have to spend a lot of money on it either. Add just a touch for proper use."
2,if you want to smell like an old lady buy this item,I liked her perfume Covet and with such a Lovely name I purchased this item hoping for the best. It is a very strong flowery (orchids?) old lady like perfume. If that is what you are looking for get this fragrance.
3,"Well, my wife likes it pretty well...........","That's what matters, right? My honey really likes it but doesn't love it. Not among her favorite scents. As for me, it absolutely sets my allergies on full tilt. I personally hate it. The average of my stars and my snookums stars gives this rating a 3 out of 5."
5,BUY THIS VIDEO!!,"I have both this video and Basic Dance in my collection, along with Neena and Veena's Bellydance Fitness for Beginners: Basic Moves video. I've always wanted to learn bellydance, but am THE WORLD'S MOST UNCOORDINATED PERSON! But, believe it or not, I have almost mastered all the moves on the videos I have! It's so much fun and so rewarding! The instruction is unparallelled, and you feel sensual and fantastic from start to finish. And as a bonus, these videos have helped me trim THREE inches off my waist in a little more than a month! I can't say enough for these tapes, and I'm buying Mystic Dance ASAP as well! :)"
5,Outstanding! Fun AND Challenging!,"I did the Basic Dance tape about 7-8 times, and then went for the Beyond Basic Dance tape. Wow. :) I've done this one 3 times now, and am slowly getting the hang of it (managed to do the three quarter shimmy for the first time today!)It is a lot of fun, and a good workout at the same time. I'm seeing new definition in my abs and hip muscles (and I've been weight training for ages!) Give it a try - Neena and Veena are very nice and friendly, without being sickening. :)"
1,"Excelent interpretation, bad sound quality","Excellent playing, marvelous singing. Great spirituality - one really feels the depth. Very different from, say, Gardiner's shallow merry melodies. But..., well, Ted Libbey in his classical cd guide wrote:(as far as I remember) ""... the Kingsway Hall ambience survives"". In my opinion, the size of the Hall changes a lot from track to track on this cd. And the orchestra sounds as if they were sitting on each other. Maybe nothing better could have been done to the original tape, but the final result is not very good. My true rating is **** for interpretation but only * for sound quality."
2,Bah!,"The tempo of 'Herr, Lehre doch mich', not to mention Fischer-Dieskau's typically pretentious and self concious phrasing, is ludicrous.Wolfgang Meyer, Jose van Dam and Samuel Ramey all leave poor ole Fischer for dead. In my world this recording just doesn't cut the mustard. Klemperer, as ever, reminds us 'subtle' was not part of his vocabulary."
5,Died and gone to heaven,"Seven stars, at least. I love Brahms and have many fine recordings of his major works, some very different from one another. In most cases I cannot say that one recording of a work is the best, except for this recording of the German Requiem. Wonderful. Klemperer, Fischer-Dieskau and Schwarzkopf are special together on this fine recording."
5,Wonderful Word Puzzles,"My daughter is almost 2 1/2 and got these for Christmas. After putting together a few at a time with me only a couple of times, she now empties the entire box and finds all the pieces, putting them all together correctly by process of elimination. I am astounded how quickly and easily she is able to fit the quality pieces. While she only recognises a few of the letters at the moment, I am sure that once she starts learning more letters and words she will have more fun reading them too. Great product! We also have the shape puzzles, colour and texture puzzles (although not many textures) and number/shape train. She loves them all!"
5,Grandaughter's Delight,"I'm a proud grandmother and appreciate the fact that despite my objection the electronic and digital age reign over traditional toys and games; however, my daughter-in-law gave huge reviews on this gift I gave my granddaughter. It's great to know there are still traditional toys out there that challenge the minds of little ones. I highly recommend this puzzle that allows shapes and words to enter a child's play space and enhances creativity."
4,Great concept,When my 2 year old opened the box all the pieces were just packed in there. We first had to match all the puzzles and then mix a few. We decided to put each in a seperate baggies and give him a few at a time mixed together.He loves matching the pictures and spelling the letters. But all 20 at once for him was overwhelming.
4,If you have an MSR stove get one of these...,"I own both the stainless steel and titanium version of these spoons. Both are good, but the titanium is better; it is both lighter and better finished, with smoother edges. If you hike or backpack with an MSR stove you might want to toss one of these spoons in your kit. You always need a spoon, right? Well why not a spoon that also doubles as a repair tool for your stove?"
4,Ideas to entertain your two year old,"The many activities are divided into language, running and jumping, animal, car, art, counting, teddy bear, imagination, nursery rhyme, singing, cooking, nature and quiet games. Within each of these headings the games are subdivided into games for the young, middle and older two year old child Many of the ideas require no or basic household materials. The book is especially valuable in giving ideas that work in the car, doctor's office, etc. I rated this book 4 stars because (in my opinion) some of the activities presented are not new or imaginative (ie sing You Are My Sunshine to your child, or do the Itsy Bitsy Spider with your child and his teddy bear) Overall the book is good and helpful however, and will introduce new ideas and remind you of some tried and true activities for the young ones."
2,Disappointing,"Have you ever acted out a story with your child? What about peek-a boo? With silly faces? If so, then you don't need this book. There are page after page of ideas, but many of them are things that you probably already do with your child. Most of the games are acting out nursery rhymes or songs. Several ideas are rehashed through out the book with just a slightly different twist- such as ""how do you move"" and ""animal moves"", both very similar games about moving like a certain animal. So what about in spring- have you ever read books about catepillars and butterflies and looked for them outside? Save your money, or buy a book of nursery rhymes to act out with your child."
5,"Excellent TV, Excellent Price, Excellent Shipping","I've only had the TV a few days, but I have to say its spectacular. It worked great right out of the box and has an awesome picture. I was particularly impressed with Amazon and the shipping company. The Amazon price including shipping was over $300 less than Best Buy's best sales price (with tax). I was a little worried about shipping such a beast, but it came on a pallet, they wheeled it right in and it was set up in about 15 minutes flat. FABULOUS SHOPPING EXPERIENCE. 5 STARS."
3,Great TV.. but remote sensor is out..,"I bought this TV in 2003 and over all I am very happy with it. About 8 months ago, the remote control stopped working on it. Since we watch TV on two different cable providers, I'm having to change the video input manually since the remote does not work. I was told that there are other Toshiba projection TVs with the same issue.Not sure how to fix this and don't want to spend too much fixing it also.Regards,GMan"
1,"Great Product, Lousy Seller","This review is more regarding the seller who sold me a defective product than the product itself. Normally this is a gel that works great and keeps my skin clear. However, I purchased this from BeautyEncounter and it turned liquidy in 2 months. I contacted Murad to see if this was normal and it is not. They told me that it would only turn watery if exposed to extreme heat or cold. I kept the container in my bathroom in the undersink cabinet - thus no extreme heat or cold conditions occurred from my actions. I've had other bottles of this that have lasted 6 months or more without turning into liquid. The seller would not accept returns and made no offer to compensate me for the defective bottle that was sold to me. That said, I will not be purchasing from them again and will make sure to order directly from Murad where an item can be returned for up to 60 days."
3,Cap was broken,"The cap was broken on this it, but I transferred it to another. Not much care is given to packaging."
5,Excellent Product,"My acne is not naturally occurring, it is a side effect from medication I have been taking for more than 15 years and it is very difficult to find a product that works. I have found that this is the best product I have tried that actually does what it says it will do, which is clear up acne. While it does not entirely prevent all my acne, it is definitely the best out of all the products I have tried and... I have tried them all."
2,Made things worse,"I bought this product when I had mild acne and occasional breakouts. At first it cleared my skin but after a few months of use, I started to breakout realllyyy bad, I haven't had such breakouts before I used this product. My cheeks especially. I don't discourage you from buying it, but I don't think it's for every type of skin obviously. Mine was a little oily but not too bad."
2,might say biginners but not for me,this might say for biginners but not for me. Im over weight and I bought this because I wanted to lose weight and get back some flexibility but this was just to advanced for me. this is just ok for someone whose a little flexible already and just want to improve it but not ofr someone who is as stiff as me. good vid thought and I will keep trying.
5,A 2nd opinion - a striking CD,"As Amazon customers may find a 2nd opinion reassuring, I will just say that I agree ..., and would add only that this very striking CD will interest more than just Britten fans. Anyone interested in lieder/mélodies (what great settings these are) or the English tenor style should have it and will understand why from the opening bars of the very first track."
4,Quilting for Dummies,As a new quilter I found this books helpful. I would of liked to have pictures and diagrams throughout book.
5,Best book on quilting basics,This was a very enlightening book; I have never quilted before and after reading this book it supplied me with all the basics needed to begin!!!!
3,A good start for beginners,"A friend recommended this book to me. I read it over the course of a few days--but I wasn't working on a project at the time. I think that it is a wonderful book, but I wish it had more information on fabric selection, etc. I personally didn't like any of the projects in the back of the book, but I did think the instructions were done well. I will probably get a few more books, but this one is a good start."
4,Very instructive,just not too colorful. I purchased a number of books when learning to quilt and this one was at the top. But there is no draw to color or photos of quilts to jazz up your imagination. It is wonderful for basic skills.
3,Dummies,Not that great in explaining things to someone that does not know anything about quilting. It reads in a knowledgeable quilting language.
5,Great show,"Heard about this show for over a year and finally gave it a try. Good stuff. Engaging, funny, good acting, and interesting to see how more progressive (according to the show) early turn-of-the 20th century England was that the US is today."
5,Silly but great!,"Addicted to this series. It's silly at times but fun. Great study of class issues. Great period clothes, food, manners. Maggie Smith is terrific and adds delightful humor. The cast is wonderful."
2,Too much editing...,"After watching part of the 56 minute version on PBS, the cuts applied to bring the running time down to 48 minutes were frustrating. The video quality (non-HD) was also poor. The plot and acting were great, too bad that the presentation was marred by editing."
5,Downton Abbey,A few friends of mine all recommended this show. I quickly became addicted and watched the first two seasons within a few days!! I absolutely love it!
4,Enjoyable period piece,Misses the program on TV. It was great to be able to watch it on amazon instant video. Pls keep more British dramas on amazon instant video
4,Very interesting as well as informative,Excellent program. it provides you with a glimse of life in England after WWI and how the world started to change in a society which was so different than ours at that time. It is also entertaining and well made. You get to know each of the characters and understand them as human beings.
4,great show,"The drama was a bit much, and the finale was what I' been hoping for for a long time. at its best are the dinner table conversations and the interesting ways life is viewed downstairs compared to upstairs."
5,Great Televison,"Compelling story line, strong acting. Maggie Smith has some of the best dialogue ever written. We will be watching for as long as it's airing."
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,"Like many others, I'm absolutely obsessed with Downton Abbey! I'm so pleased with my bluray copies of all the seasons. They are so crisp and clear on the screen."
2,Downton Abbey,"We love Downton Abbey, in fact we bought this episode because it was described as ""the original British version"". But instead of extra scenes, scenes were missing. We also thought it would be Episode 3, (so far we had watched 1 & 2), and it was a repeat of Episode 2. AND we had friends over for the ""big event""'. So there is definite confusion in the description of this show. Amazon made it right, and support was very swift and excellent in helping me recover my password, I've mentioned that to everyone I know, no complaints there. But we won't be buying any more episodes."
5,Love this show,Great story line. If you like english you will like this. Pick it up today at Amazon dot com. Enjoy.
5,Great Series,I have watched all 3 seasons. The story is great as are the costumes and scenery. I would highly recommend this for any age. Another wonderful British Series.
1,Does not play on US systems!,"I just sent for this, got it, and tried it on my DVD player. Doesn't work. Have returned it to the UK. What's the deal here???"
1,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS... YOU CAN WATCH IT FOR FREE ON THE PBS WEBSITE!!!!!,DO NOT PURCHASE THIS... AS OF 1/14/13 YOU CAN WATCH THE FIRST TWO EPISODES FOR FREE ON THE PBS WEBSITE!!!!! (I'm sure they will post new episodes as well.)http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/masterpiece/watch-online/
5,Engaging!!!,"I have watched many British tv, movies and was a bit apprehensive to watch and have to say not only was I wonderfully entertained, but am engaged! This is so wonderfully done and orchestrated! I also love that I could download this to my Amazon library, very convenient!!"
5,Loved Downton Abbey exiciting Season three,Downton Abbey takes me to another world. The acting is first rate as are the story and plot.The writer knows his subject and his characters. I love that the story comes from the environment and the characters' values.
1,Time to quit,"I just finished watching the final episode of Season 3, and I am done watching this series. It began faltering in season 2. It seems that the producers/writers are beginning to use the ""let's kill off a character to get things moving again"" method. Give me a break. First we see Sibyl die and her child left motherless, now we see Matthew die and his child left fatherless. I guess it has been decided that no one deserves to have any happiness longer than a couple episodes. What a cheap shot. You killed off one of your best characters, folks, and one that the series has revolved around from the beginning. This series is starting to remind me of the endless X-Files series where the viewer was constantly dangled the alien carrot with no resolution, the difference being that instead of the elusive aliens, we are being asked to jump from one transitory character to another and thank them for it. Sayonara."
4,Finally!!!,What a breath of fresh air! No gratuitous sex and violence. I love the story line and the characters.Can't wait for season 4!!!!!
5,Jewel for PBS,"This series of ""Masters"" is a jewel in the crown of PBS That shows the talent and dication put into producing it."
5,Great show,"This show is so dynamic, and Maggie Smith is simply delightful. Every character is so intriguing, it is simply a show that everyone should try watching. If you're like me and love movies like 'Pride and Prejudice', than you'll love this show."
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,"Love Downton Abbey. So many stories going on, it helps to watch it again. I will enjoy watching it many times."
2,Unable to View Episode 6,"I have not been able to watch Episode 6...even though I ended up purchasin it in stead of using my Prime account. I still own it though, so maybe there is still a chance. I am away from my country...in case that matters. I will try again when I get home."
2,Becoming a Standard Soap Opera,"I am not nearly as engaged with season three of Downton as I was with one and two. Not being engaged means I am able to notice how completely silly the show is. The Granthams are ridiculous, flouncing about with their privilege. Violet is still funny but her lines seem forced and non-organic to the flow of conversation. The love story between Anna and Bates limps on, and Bates could be a complex character but the saccharine sweetness of the plot line jerks us back to the simple minded. Maybe it will perk up?"
5,Downton Abby,"""Downton Abby "" Best series I've EVER seen! FANTASTIC!!! Can't wait to see the rest of the series! Please keep continuing!"
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,"Better than the first two seasons, if that is possible! Can't wait for Season 4! Please don't let it end like this!"
5,I LOVE Downton Abbey!,The cast is amazing. The story line engaging. The scenery breathtaking. The music marvelous. The costumes spectacular. Dame Maggie Smith and Shirley MacLaine - What a pair!
5,My little island,"In a loud and somewhat chaotic sea of life I get to sit on my little island of downtown abbey every Sunday nite and bask in the warm sunshine of these lovely stories. So far season 3 has lived up to its predecessors, giving me both the beautifully sweet and the ugly sordid sides of life in post WW iii Britain. But please somebody come on and marry poor darling Edith soon!"
3,Could have been five stars...,"... but Amazon is sorely lacking with their closed caption programing.This is only CC on your computer (when I watched it in Jan 2013), not if you are watching it using a PS3 or ""non-Amazon"" device. The other missing star is because the streaming was always buffering and then I lost picture quality. It went from a quality HD picture to something quite out of focus. This was using an HDMI cable from my computer to my TV (so I could watch it on the big screen with CC).As soon as Amazon catches up with their nearest competition (associated with the color red) in the streaming department... I will give five star programs such as Downton Abbey five stars. Great series, mediocre digital delivery."
3,Downton Abbey,I have really enjoyed Downton Abbey up to season 3. I wish you would keep it more lighthearted instead of it being so traumatic. Having Sybil die was harsh. Not looking forward to more episodes. Very sad! Loved seasons 1 and 2.
5,Wonderful series,I love this continuing saga of Downton Abbey and can't wait for more episodes. It shows that even the wealthy have their issues. The servants have tales of their own. It completely holds my attention.
5,Pre-ordered item,This item is not due to be shipped until January 2013 but my daughter asked for it so I'm sure she'll love it when it arrives.
3,I anticipated too much for first episode.,"It was good, I must have expected more. I will keep watching future episodes to see how it shakes out."
3,Disappointed,"I just purchased the UK version of Seasons 1 & 2 and enjoyed the acting, costumes, plot, character development etc. What bothered me is that the 8th episode of Season 2, a very critical episode, was not part of the UK version. And the Christmas episode came on a DVD that was damaged and needed to be returned. The damage aside, I was very disappointed not to have the 8th episode and after spending the money to purchase these 2 seasons had to make additional purchases to see the episodes that were omitted. I have already pre-ordered the 3rd Season which will be available on Jan 29th and am second guessing whether this was a wise decision as I'm concerned there will also be missing episodes. I would caution anyone purchasing the UK version not to do so, but rather to wait until some US version comes along. That last episode of Season 2 and the Christmas episode really brought the season full circle and set the stage for Season 3."
4,Downton Abbey Season 3,Like the fact that I could purchase the episodes I missed and the view was great!! Can always go back to the library and view again.
5,SOOooo GOOD!!!,Don't miss all of the scenes they take out to fit the US time slot on PBS! Purchase the FABULOUS UK Version of 3rd Season!!! I now have all 3 seasons in the UK Versions and I LOVE IT!! Purchase it!!
5,Wonderful period drama.,"The sets, the acting, the conniving, the scenery. Love it all!I'm not a big tv watcher but I watched this season in three evenings."
5,Couldn't wait for season to air,"We are mesmerized with this show in my house, and couldn't wait for the season to finish, so we had to buy the tv pass so we could get all episodes of season 3 right now."
5,Downton abbey,"Love this show, will watch again , just ordered the 3 rd season, still watching the 2 nd season, can't wait"
5,Great way to start the season.,"Fab acting and true to the heart. I hope everything works out for Mary and Matthew, but who knows how the tides will turn. Suspense is building..."
5,Stunned,Final scene of Season 3 stunned me. Hoping this turns out to be a teaser and Matthew reappears in Season 4! Must we wait a whole year to find out??
2,3rd disc does not play properly,Great story. Problem with third DVD. Quite irritating to miss half of episode 7. Will be returning . Pain in the neck.
3,More of the same but more deaths,"The storylines are bland, and character deaths are in season. SPOILER: The youngest daughter is most disposable, so she dies. The male romantic lead (Matthew) dies because the actor refused to extend his contract. Rather sudden, isn't it?"
5,Downton Abbey Season 3 preview,"I rated this 5 stars baised on the first two seasons. I am looking forward to season 3, and expect that it will not disapoint. I do not see any weaknesses in this production, writing, cast, everyone associated with it."
1,Blu-ray malfunction,"I had to return the blu-ray due to a malfunction at the end of the disk. Downton is great, but the BD malfunction left us hanging."
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,"Well done. Loved all the segments. I knew something bad would happen, but just when you think you have it figured out....something else comes. The last episode was so saaaaaad! Can't wait for the next season!"
5,"Great story, captivating series","Great program without violance, story of love, family, after war times in England, peak into how the British monarchy lived."
5,Could not stop viewing the story,Sorry Mathew died. He is one of the main stars in this story. If it continues HE will be missed.
5,Downton Abbey Season 3,"This DVD was ordered for my Granddaughter because she isa big fan of the series. If it makes her happy, it makes me happy."
5,Obsessed with Downton Abbey,I just started watching the show last week. I love it!!! I had to go back and get caught up with Seasons 1 & 2. It's all I've been watching over the last couple of days.
5,Very Entertaining!!,It is never boring and you never know what will happen next. The actors are very good at portraying that time period.
5,Just a well played and well written show.,If you want to know if I liked the product I’ll give you stars that is the best I can do. If I were able to give great reviews I would be getting paid to do so. I either like or don’t like but I can not tell you why other than I did not get anxious at any time.This is one of the reasons I don’t usually participate in these types of reviews.
5,Couldn't put it down -- even when I had to!,"As a struggling nonprofit employee with piles of student loan debt, I often roam the aisles of Barnes & Noble seeking out quality books that I can request from the library. This book not only jumped off the shelves at me, but kept me coming back to B&N; for three consecutive days to finish it.It was excellent. Well-written. Captivating."
4,"Exactly ""The recordings of the century""","There are many recording of ""Four Last Songs"", but this one is considered as one of the best by critics (In Japan, this one is said to be the first choice of this song.) Yes, I agree with it. Yes, this is one of the best. It's natural that it should be said to be the best one. I like Schwarzkopf's singing, but compared with the first one with Ackerman (from EMI), I prefer the Ackerman to this one. But there are some advantages in this one. Schwarzkopf's interpretation is, as always, wonderful. And there are 12 other lieder such as ""Zueignung"" ""Morgen!"" and so on. (Both of them are my favorite!) You can enjoy the wonderful world of Richard Strauss lieder. This one must be the good introduction of Richard Strauss' lieder for you."
5,The Best Affordable Light Compact Tripod out there,"Smooth, light, tough, precise this is one of the greatest traveling tripod I have ever used. It is non-professional tripod of course but it does feel as perfect as a pricy non-fluid head tripod could feel. Obviously being a lighter tripod this item is not extremely stable but it is more stable than other robust tripods out there. Excellent design too, for $100 you will not be disappointed."
5,"Different babies, different mamas... it's all good","Thanks Ariel for writing such a kick-ass book. This book helped me to totally relax and realize I am doing what is right for me and my baby and have been doing it all along. Also, it helps to hear wanting ME-time is not selfish but keeps you sane. Some of the ideas in this book were things I was feeling but couldn't put into words. I passed this book along to my sister who also let out a little sigh of relief. We both agree that the time is now for redefining motherhood. In this sense Ariel's book is revolutionary."
1,Not alone,"I'm relieved to see I am not alone in not liking this book, The Mother Trip. I had a very negative gut reaction to this book. It just makes me feel out of sorts and a little queasy. It reads FAKE to me. The Mother Trip isn't anything I'd have represent me or my adventures in mamahood. I wouldn't recommend this book. I can't think of anything I liked about it."
4,Good light for the money,"This light is easy to attach and shines brightly, both to the rear and to the sides. It would have received five stars had it not been for the choice of batteries. Although Planet isn't the only manufacturer to do this, trying to power 7 LEDs on two AAA batteries is just plain silly."
1,Not durable,I have a short commute to work and I've had this light for about 8 months. It's a pretty smooth ride and I don't jump curbs or anything like that. I got home the other night and it was gone... it just broke off leaving the clip in the holder. I just can't recommend something that breaks this easily.
5,A Must Have for commuters,"Good brightness and mountability makes this light a super value for the consumer, and invaluable in the safety it can provide for the night rider."
5,Great Comb !,"We have an Australian Labradoodle, it has very thick and curly hair. This is the only comb that can handle the job. We have tried many others and this one is the best !"
3,I got what I paid for but was disappointed,I felt that for 50$ I should get a system with more sound quality.Partly I should have read more and maybe spent 10 more dollars for a better model. I expected more from the JVC line. There is no bass or treble adjustment and it is somewhat tinny sounding. It works fine but not a deep rich sound. If I was thinking of buying this item I would buy a better model instead...
1,Designed for children,"I hadn't realized when I bought this that it's a pamphlet designed for children (large print, easier language). It was so annoying to read that I drove 1hr to get the adult version from a local library."
5,essential reading,"I am quite upset with myself for not reading him years ago. There is something here for everyone, I can't recommend it enough. A true original and independent thinker, a Great American (in the very best sense of the phrase), a marvelous writer. The love, no---can't find the right word here---of language, learning, reading shines through, whether he's championing Paul Bowles, exposing the Kennedys, or mourning the death of Italo Calvino. Sentence after sentence after sentence glide across the pages. You'll always find yourself immersed. It won't matter what you think of his politics, self-advertising, highbrow gossip, etc. Read this. Oh, almost forgot to mention the exquisite humor and wit. Again, read this!"
4,"A good mystery, whodunit, set in the SouthWest","I don't know if this book accurately depicts Indian life on the reservation---I don't know anybody from there, never been there.All in all, I found the characters very interesting and nice, made me want to visit.It was a good, interesting whodunit cop story, full of the no-nonsense practicality of the cop-life (my dad was a cop long ago), contrasting with the reservation's strong metaphysical world, all set in a mellow, laid-back, sunbaked world of mountains, sheep and horses.I must say, if one of my hometown cops was a an equivalent minister-on-the-side, and soliciting his services, he would probably be teased to death.I really enjoyed the descriptions of all the scenery, people's mannerisms, how they live, talk, treat each other, concerns over manners. I wanted to hear more of their metaphysical life, studies for it, actually more of everything."
2,"Light weight drill, not a good value","If this drill is on sale for less than twenty bucks, and you don't need much power - this could be the drill for you. The battery doesn't come off, the cheap charger just plugs into the handle."
3,Good choice if you don't already know these concepts,"This book focuses on how our attitudes and beliefs affect the degree to which fibromyalgia affects our daily life. But then, a positive attitude is shown to have a positive influence on all illnesses. If I hadn't already learned these concepts thoroughly from my 12 step program, this book would probably have been extremely helpful to me. As it was, there wasn't much here that I didn't already know. I was also disappointed that the author paints fibromyalgia as being 'all in your head so you can wish it away if you want to'. Fibro is a neurological disorder. I wanted to see some real recommendations (like emphasis on the daily use of ultra-refined fish oil). The most valuable part of the book is that there are alternatives to pharmaceuticals and that you don't need to let fibro define you. Those recently diagnosed would probably benefit from this book"
3,Great Buy,Ofcourse this dickies pants was my exact size and exactly what i needed but it took a while to arrive!
4,good production,"Angela Gheorghiu and Bryn Terfel have been around for a while - they give give dependably good to excellent performances and here ,as expected, they are fine. Jonas Kaufmann is becoming one of most exciting singers around- Verdi, Bizet and Wagner-he does them all and gives dependably great performances."
1,falls short,"OMG!!! what happened to my great shaper plus!!!It used to hold through wind storms,rain storms and blizzards.....now I barely get out of my car in the morning and my hair is in my face!!as usual everyone has to mess with perfection!! I did't like the New Coke either..well, off to the Dollar Store to find something better!"
1,New Formula is Bad!,"I've have used Shaper Plus for years and love the OLD formula. The new stuff does not work and is not worth the money. I was getting the old Shaper Plus for about the last year thru Amazon, but now when I order it they are sending the new stuff, even when the picture is showing the old can. I wish they would bring back the old formula."
5,excellent 5 stars *****,I have ordered from this Vendor several times and the Hairspray comes very quickly and I love the product. One time the spray did not operate and they sent me a new one-no questions asked. Highly recommend. Price is great.
5,Best Hairspray Ever!,"This hairspray holds your hair in place however it doesn't weigh it down. It has a pleasant smell, and is reasonably priced."
5,"Quiet, looks nice, works well. May buy another.","Pros: Fan is very quiet, looks good, feels well made, & the blades are very easy to install & didn't require any balancing out of the box. Blades are also reversible (2 colors). May buy another for the next room. Very happy with it.Cons:- Rubber bands on the globes slowly burn & smell if using the included incandescent 60W bulbs. Suggest removing them before first use else you will be scraping their charred remains off the globes. I wrapped the area in teflon tape instead.- Uses candelabra bulbs. To find 60W equivalent CFL bulbs, you will probably have to order online."
3,DO NOT USE ON REAL GUNS,I slathered this stuff all over my 12 gauge and couldn't seem to get a grip to load it. Not smart. doesn't resist corrosion well either.
5,Best lube I have ever used!,This stuff is amazing. It never dries out and is totaling non sticky. I highly recommend this one!!
2,Leaky pump,"As for the lube itself -- if you like silicone lube, you'll like this one. The 32oz pump is a slightly embarrassing size but if you've ever fooled around with the 8oz pump bottles you know how frustrating they are -- clearly nobody tested the things in real life situations. This comes with a standard pump top, which would seem ideal for ease of use and for being sanitary. However, the thing leaks. Silicone has been slowly dripping out from the pump, has coated the entire bottle, and left a significant pool on the nightstand. This might be a fluke, but I've had similar problems with other plastic bottles in the shower and the only solution I've found has been to transfer the product to another container. And i just don't have a 32oz (now 29oz) pump bottle lying around."
4,JVC TH-M65,"This system is very nice!! (100watts x 5)(Subwoofer 120watts) Very good quality product!! Sounds great! Well worth the $500.00 I paid for it at my Base Exchange(BX) here in Aviano, Italy... I would recommend it over any of thr ""top brands"", such as Sony."
3,Not for MAC?,"My husband got the book for Christmas, so I took a peak. I was instantly blessed by the author's voice in the devotional. I immediately went to the web site to order a copy for myself. I was so excited that there was a CD version that I could listen to on my computer that I ordered it right away--only to realize upon delivery that it was the Microsoft Windows version. I have a MAC. Needless to say, I'm disappointed. I hope there will be a MAC version soon."
5,Superb Book!! Truly Enlightening!!,"This book, Sparkling Gems, takes you much deeper into the meaning of the scriptures. You can't rush through it, you have to ""chew"" on it; it is the true meat of the Word of God."
5,A Wonderful Surprise,"I already own the hard cover book Sparkling Gems and have enjoyed it daily. Although I have used it for 3 years now I learn new spiritual insight with each reading. After getting the electronic version I was opened up to a wonderful surprise which I did not expect. The ease of finding a reference is amazing, I especially enjoy the size of the entire reading on my laptop, and no more do I have to lug around the 1000 page book when visiting my son and his wife. I am extremely happy with the purchase and my only regret is that I did not buy it 3 years ago."
3,Good but not great,Generally this is a good book. Some of his points are out of bounds. It is an OK read.
4,Sparkling Gems,"a must have for your christian library collection, there's a chapter in this book that addresses every problem area in your life and it also helps by offering good christian solutions to these problems"
5,Sparkling Gems,"I tell you, this is a great book and a best buy. I have had the book for a few years now; and try to read it every day... it has taught me so much."
4,Good for the money,"I bought this a long time ago, Still in good shape, I use it almost every day, good product"
2,Enjoy the Cool Pictures But Make Up Your Own Story,"A boy sees a mysterious airship in the clouds and is invited aboard by Puss in Boots and Peter Pan. Along with other storybook characters they fly to the Story Cloud, a land where all the nice characters from make-believe live in ""reality."" The illustrations in this book are vivid, full of sparkle and big round full moons, seascapes and starry skies. I loved them, but unfortunately, the story is preachy, wordy new age posturing and if you want to share the delightful illustrations with a child, I suggest you both make up a story of your own to go with the pictures. Here's an example of the text. ""The fact that each and everyone's life is unique...means that each and everyone's life is identical."" Here's another. ""You see, once we've found our heart and imagined ourselves...then the whole story plays like a big symphony, with everyone imagining everyone else...one great dream in which all the dream characters dream, too."" Yeah, right..."
2,Poor DVD Playback,"I thought I got a great deal on this DVD/VCR Combo unit at $85.00. That is, until I actually tried to use it. The setup was easy enough. However, the first three DVD+Rs I tried to play skipped throughout the DVD and then eventually stopped playing. I had to eject the discs in order to reset it. I run my TV through my vcr so the unit has to be turned on in order for my TV to work. Maybe it was getting too hot but I did not have this problem with my old unit. I gave it two stars because I did not even try playing a video tape before I returned it to the store."
2,DVD player acting up after a year.,"When I first got this player, everything worked great, and the picture was very crisp. Now a year later, the DVD player is starting to act up. I was watching a movie and all of the sudden the dvd froze and I heard this clicking sound. I tried to fast foward and then rewind it, but it wouldn't budge. It got to the point that it would not allow me to eject the dvd or turn the player off. Finally I had to unplug it for awhile, and then was able to get the dvd out. I thought it might be just that dvd, but then I was watching another one and it did the same thing. A friend of mine has the Phillips DVP620VR and has experienced the same problem, and its now to the point that it won't play some dvd's at all. I would not recommend this player for long term use."
1,DO NOT buy this product,DO NOT BUY THIS DVD/VCR COMBO.!This is easily the worst electronics purchase I've made in the last 2 years. I returned the item after using it for 5 days.1. The remote control is terriblely made. The numbers are not organized in standard format (1/2/3; 4/5/6; 7/8/9; 0). Instead they're laid out in two rows. It's absolutely terrible design.2. It's impossible to program the VCR to record shows. The menu is nearly impossible to figure out even for a technically savvy person. I shudder to imagine my sister attempting to program a recording of her favorite show.3. The LED display is so small that you cannot see it if you're more than 6 feet away.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!!!!!!!!
5,A well done anthology!,"I really love this Styx anthology, it hits all the high spots of Styx's career and then some! I just can't say enough about how great it truly is! The sound is excellent and it brings back so many memories, I just love it! All of the songs are excellent and well picked-out, I think they did a great job choosing the songs to include. If you get one Styx compilation it really should be this one!"
3,Quality sound but then there's that CD changer...,"I bought this unit for my ""smokers lounge"" about 14 months ago. I have a heated garage where I puff on the occaisional cigar, sip some eau-de-vie and listen to my music. For quite some time I was extremely pleased with this little unit. It held its own.About 9 months ago the 5 disc CD changer started skipping...not much at first and only on discs 4 and 5. Slowly things got worse until it became unuseable. I plugged an old Teac single disc player into the Auxilary input and it works fine. I did not want to hassle with a return or the dreaded warranty work.I agree with some of the other reviewers: the remote is anything but intuitive (but it works...in most cases, well) and the tape player will eat your tapes if you are not gentle and let the autoload feature take it from you.Bottom line: It sounds great, it has many nice features, it has very good speakers but the CD player (at least in mine) is junk."
2,Find something else,"We will live with this system, but its not a good choice. The tapes goes in sideways and if the least little thing happens, the tape gets stuck and won't eject. There is no way to fix this yourself. We had to take it into the repair shop after 1 day to take out the mangled tape. We won't be using the tape player much. Some of the functions are on the remote, so you have to always have the remote handy right there. It is a very fine, wonderful sound - so at least we have that."
4,worth every dollar - but read forth...,This product may not be good for everyone - it work very well for me. I had disc problem and found out that I tend to missalign my spine during sleep (no matter which matterss I use) This product put my spine back in place. Note however:1. It is quite uncomfortable at the beginning.2. I only need the lower back - It not very comfortable at the upper part for me3. YOU WILL NEED A GOOD PILLOW to support the neck and head - otherwide your back pain will be better - but you get a stiff neck.4. It does come with a document - but only one cheap looking page - didn't bother me though.Bottom line - it worth every $ - if it fits your back problem.
4,Gentle and effective spine alignment,"I use the Spine-Worx almost daily, enjoying its easy yet effective assistance in keeping my spine normal. It's more pleasant than a more aggressive instrument such as a Ma Roller (which I now use only occasionally when I have a really stubborn knot somewhere). On the Spine-Worx it's easy to increase the effect in various places by shifting your weight, moving arms or legs, etc. Only drawback is that it doesn't do much for the top of the spine (as the instructions acknowledge), but that can be improved a little by proping the upper end of the device 2 or 3 inches above the floor. Overall a very useful instrument for the money."
2,doesn't compare to chiropractor by any means,I have upper back issues. It barely helps there (they honestly claim that in their ad). I am not sure how good it is on lower back. However I feel its a mediocre product.1. It doesn't compare to a chiropractor by any means2. I can get 5x better results with yoga exercise.
4,Very good product,"I live 100 miles from the nearest chiropractor so this has been a life saver. It really does work to help align my spine. It is a little tricky to get into it, but well worth the effort. The only reason that I did not give it 5 stars is because it only addresses your lower and middle back. Most of my issues are in the upper back and cervical areas so i have to get creative. But all in all, for the price, everyone should own one of these."
1,Meh,"This really didn't DO anything. At all. I have damage from an old severe whiplash injury and since I spend hours on the computer, I was hoping it would help at least with upper back pain. It kinda hurt although I tried to stick with it to see if it would get better, but really, it did nothing. Several friends tried it too and all agreed it was lame & you're better off with something less passive like massage, chiropractic, yoga, tens units, and/or exercise balls. Bottom line is you gotta get things moving and the blood flowing as much as possible for any real relief. If laying around on a piece of plastic really helped I would have invested!!!!"
1,Unhappy Customer,Item was nothing like I expected. It was nothing but a piece of hard rubber that did not live up to its intended purpose. It is a rip off and Amazon should discontinue seeling this item.
3,Great device to manipulate your spine,"Works well - but if you're over 300 pounds be careful. It's a bit flimsy at 300.5 stars for the concept, only 2 stars for the execution."
4,Definately aligns the back,"Aligns the back well. Was a bit painful for me during the first few uses. I was hoping it would pop my back more. I think it could be better if they made a couple more sizes as this is a one size fits all and at 74"" I'm near the suggested height limit. Overall the product helps and seems to be sturdy enough to last at least a couple years."
2,Alittle painful.,I know I am not using it correctly. It is painful. I am keeping it and a friends is going to teach me how to use it properly. Not for someone who is uncomfortable with crawling on the ground.
2,didn't work for me,"I really wish this would have helped me, but it didn't. I have used it for about 2 months now. I have been seeing a chiropractor for a year, so my back should be used to being put back into alignment. I once used it right before seeing the chiropractor and felt no change, and thought well maybe my spine is aligned. Went to the chiropractor and from the sounds she was making on my spine, I must have been a mess. I felt much better after I left her office, but I don't feel much of anything after using this product."
3,Thought it would be better,So far the product is only mediocre. Laying down on it and getting your spine properly centered isnt so easy. There isnt much space to fit your spine and you fall off center fairly easily. Your back does feel better after laying on it for a few minutes. It just takes a little while getting used to it and balancing on it well. It shipped fast and in a big box.
2,"painful, hard device with no give","I bought this unit and something similar to the ""Back Magic Multi-Level Adjustable Back Stretching Device"" a couple years ago. When I laid back on this device all I could feel is sharp pain on my spine. This device is hard and has no give, so your spine adjusts without any cushioning. This hurt me so I gave it to good will. The multi-level lumbar adjuster works well though, and I have used it to stretch my back for years."
2,Wanted this to work badly.,"I've had back pain for 12 years now. I'm a female 5'8 and 135lb. This device seems too small for me. The yellow raised rubber that is suppose to aligns on both sides of your spine does not seem far enough apart to be effective at all, and even the length seems to short. I swear that the five star reviews are written but people that work for this company. I tried this for a month. It really did not hurt my back but also did not pop it back into place or even relax it. I'm very sorry I bought this. Added note: I found that my old still point inducer that I owned when I moved the down my spine (instead of under my neck) and placed it in various spots was more effective then this."
4,verdict still out,it hasn't completely helped me yet....but will continue to use and give it time to work......
1,sucks,This product is a paradox. How are you supposed to align your spine when your supposed un-aligned spine isn't even straight enough to fit in that lil thing? maybe it might make it worse. cheap product that doesn't work. and yes i have one but it's somewhere in the trash now.
1,Don't waste your money!,"I was so hopeful and excited when I bought this item... especially when most of the reviews were so glowing (I especially liked, ""bottom line, if the dog ate it, I'd buy another."") Unfortunately, I can not figure out what all the excitement is about. It truly must be an ""individual thing"" as to whether you will like this product or not. My personal review is: NOT!!! In my opinion, it's a cheap and possibly dangerous product. Do yourself and your back a favor and go see an actual chiropractor and/or your primary physician if your back is needing some adjustment/care. Avoid this one!"
2,2 for Now,"I had a herniated disc in my L4 and L5 about 2 1/2 years ago. In my laziness, I never stayed with my exercises, and I opted not to get back surgery. Fast Forward to today, and I still have back pain. I wanted to try some products to get me started towards a healthy back again. I ordered the Spine-Worx and the Lumbar Extender Back Stretcher. I liked the Lumber Extender, I did not like the Spine-Worx. It made my back hurt worse than when I started. This product has potential, but not until my back is stronger and healthier. I will try it again then, but for now, it is too demanding on my back, making me not sure if it is really helping or harming my progress."
5,Just tried it last night,"I have had back pain since i was in my mid 20's.Chiropractic relief and Massage are the only things that have ever really worked.I tried this thing for 15 minutes last night and woke up without any pain at all! Now, in about 15 mintues, i was feeling some spinal discomfort (not from the device... just normal discomfort) and jumped back on for about 20 minutes. Right now i feel great.This thing is worth the money. I heard a few pops as i felt some wonderful releases this morning. This is the first product review i have ever written... i was compelled to tell anyone who has chronic lower back pain to GET THIS THING - IT'S AWESOME!!!"
2,It Hurts,"I purchased this device hoping it would be good for my back. Frankly, the product is mostly hard plastic except for the tough rubber parts designed to align your spine. If you are a person of size, I would not recommend this at all because it really hurts. I can only stand to lay on it for 30 seconds maybe a minute before the pain is just too much. I might also add, that I don't have major back problems, so it's not preexisting pain being exacerbated - it's just hurts."
4,Not bad!,"I went ahead and took a chance last month and purchased a Spine Worx device. I am a 40 yr old guy with a beat up back, but no major injuries.I purchased this to reduce the number of visits to my Chiropractor. I use it about 3-5 times per week, for just a few minutes each day. I must say it's not bad! Prior to purchasing this, I would often lay flat on my back (on the floor), but this is much better.I am Happy with it and even though it is no Chiropractor replacement, it's a good tool for your toolbox for back pain relief."
3,need better instructions,"seems well made, heavy plastic, great seller, but over-priced. This thing should cost $10 at most. I still can't seem to figure out exactly how to line up and get my spine on this thing. Don't waste your money."
2,back pain,Its okay...not what i was hoping for. It works but takes a while to learn and get results. Before using make sure you understand completely or you can really hurt yourself.
5,I would have never guessed...,"that something so unassuming could make me feel so great!It just arrived and I've used it twice.Not only does it give relief within minutes,I feel great when I get up.Back pain is not uncommon as we age but many don't realize that every aspect of you body's function is controlled by the spine.Anyone that has dealt with it knows many days are far worse than others.I have an inversion table,Pilates and the electric massager that you sit against and this thing with no plug or wires gives me much more relief.I'm truly amazed and pray it helps many others suffering from this kind of pain,it can be unbearable.I've searched the web and Amazon has the best price with free shipping."
1,Sent this back!,"I found this product difficult to use with existing back pain. I had trouble lining up my spine to this thing. If you decide to order this contraption, have someone help you lay onto it and then help you to get off of it... it's not as easy as it looks and I couldn't relax enough to lay on it for 15 minutes.Also, the instructions sheet was a copy of a copy of a copy, so some of the instructions were not even available to read because words ran off the pages."
2,Spine-Worx didn't do anything for me....,"I bought Spine-Worx on Amazon...having had constant back pain as a result from an auto accident over 20 yrs ago, added body weight and just plain back pain. I used it the way the instructions called for and nothing happened. I used it every day and gave it a 30 day try and still nothing. Maybe you will have different results than I did."
5,Stupendous!!!,I bought this for my lower back. I must say that it worked absolute miracles for me. It is painful and hard to get used to at first but concentrating on letting your muscle's relax is the key. Consistency on a daily basis is also key. Great product. I know what I am getting some people for Christmas!!!
4,Excellent acnecdotal examples,Agnieszka Winkler has written a very interesting book. Her personal experiences provide great examples of the changes that branding has gone through. Her style is fresh and easy to read and is not the typical dry business book style. A must read for anyone who is actively involved with branding!
2,Basura,"This is one trashy and raunchy movie, although it does capture the underbelly of Carnaval in Las Tablas Panama. Plenty of gay/bi-sexual encounters. I'm sure the Panamanian censors (they do exist) won't (and probably don't) like this less than glamorous portrayal of Carnival but there it is. In plain sight!"
1,False advertisement,"The product description say ""Three black 8/32 threaded fiber optic pins with red or green fiber optic"". When in fact they only ship you one."
1,coping begins with facing what you're doing,"This book is missing a lot of critical information! 'How to have a successful affair' is one chapter that I could do without. 'Be prepared for the betrayed spouse to find out'? How do you prepare for a possible nuclear blast?You may be prusuing your own happiness through an affair at the extreme expense of others including children. Much information points to adultery as a transgenerational problem. Did your parents do it? What was that like? It's an unfortunate legacy to pass on to your children.Sneaky underhanded behavior frought with lies such as adultery is never ok.Let that 'secret' out so that the betrayed is given the basic human dignity to make his/her own desicions....especially when VD and AIDS can come their way.Conducting a secret affair, and then enjoying the everyday comforts of home with the unknowing spouse, (who may be devastated by this truth), is a form of rape."
4,Extra Material for Studying,"LSAT 180 is interesting in that it is supposed to be more difficult than regular LSAT questions but is also intended to help improve your LSAT taking-skills. The questions are difficult but all they aren't perfect.The Logic Games seem reasonably similar to LSAT games, the main difference being the amount of space they take up on the page. The Logical Reasoning questions felt pretty far afield from real test questions. Finally Reading Comprehension was more similar to a real RC section than the LR questions but not quite as close as the games. Games are the real winner in this book.I wouldn't recommend this book for regular LSAT studying but it's not a bad idea if you run out of regular LSAT material."
2,Not really about relashionships,"I didn't like the book. It is focused on biased descriptions of some kind of ""typical"" mother-characters and I would expect serious analysis of a person's relashionship with their mother. It seems like the book assumes you'll read these ""typical"" descriptions, find the one that ""matches"" and this alone will miraculously solve your problem."
5,I WISH I HAD READ THIS TEN YEARS AGO!!!!!!!!,"If I had, maybe the last decade would have been better for me, but the future is brighter now that I have read this book. This book could have been written about me,it hit so close to home. It has helped me move beyond being bound by the pain of this dysfunctional relationship and view the pathos between us subjectively. Thanks to this book, I will actually have a future without being terrorized by my avenger mother type. Thank you so much, and gals, trust me, you need this book!!!!!"
4,A good intro shamanism and beautiful artwork!,"A very nice primer on the subject of shamanism with wonderful illustrations by the author. There may be better written intros on this subject, but this one is DEFINITELY the best illustrated!"
3,Accent on Individuality,"Lovely looking book features plenty of gorgeous photos of Santa Fe & Taos gardens BUT I was hard-pressed to find a prototypical southwest garden in the lot.Therefore, I suppose this would be most useful to the person who wants ideas for something atypical in the region. (Or just the thing for the person who's seen the usual sunflower, skull, and terra cotta styling and is dying to see some new twists on the Santa Fe look). There's some extreme modernity in here, bold color choices, and very individualist gardens. So although it was not what I wanted, it is indeed a collection of hidden, off-the-beaten-track Santa Fe gardens."
5,the best MK game ever,I'm a big fan of the MK game series and this new game is so amazing. More brutal fatalities and better control of your character. Lots of stuff to buy in the krypt and have a blast with Chess and Puzzle Kombat. The new fatalities are easy to do and beating the game is very easy instead of nearly impossible in the older games. If you're a fan of MK game series please buy it now and have a blast.
4,A bit too much blood but great fighting game,"It's a great game, I think there may be too much blood since the same quantity appears with each blow, it would improve if the ammount of blood depends of the blow and the place it connects.The idea of each character having up to 3 combat styles makes the game more diverse and can add a bit more of strategy when fighthing, just like the 2 extra games.The final boss in the arcade is incredibly tough, but it has a fighthing pattern, once you realize that you can beat him.The Konquest game used it to unlock characters and other stuff is well done, not my favorite way to unlock stuff but it is well done.The online fighting, the main reason I bough the game works -ok-, I think the guys at Gamespy should improve their bandwidth since I got a good conection and sometimes I get poor performance fithing online and I'm talking fighting against people with more than 3 stars whihc means that they're supose to have good connections."
5,Saving Silverman review,"The movie showed up the first day of the delivery spread, and the movie is in great condition. I'm very satisfied. :-D"
4,The Critics are wrong,"This is a fun no brainer movie that will make anyone laugh. If your looking for something more than a good laugh then watch Mr. Smith goes to Washington. If you just want to forget about things for an hour and a half buy it, watch it, and enjoy it."
1,Don't Bother,"I went and saw this movie and wanted to leave as it was so bad, but I am a fan of Neil Diamond's and wanted to see his portion in the movie. Thank God his part in it was fair and the only good thing about the movie. Unfortunate for him I feel that he wasted his time and effort on doing the movie. He would have faired much better writing another song. Would I recommend this movie to anyone ... NO"
3,Evil Woman,"Saving Silverman is an example of a movie so stupid that it's actually pretty good. I couldn't stop laughing even as I felt my IQ dropping. Who would have thought of a movie where the three males are Neil Diamond enthusiasts?Jack Black is my new favorite guy to watch in comedies. I love him in Shallow Hal also.Amanda Peet is excellent as the ""evil woman."" The way she keeps outwitting Black and Kahn is so fun to watch.The weak links are Jason Biggs and Amanda Wheeler. I remember Biggs from when he was on the soap opera As The World Turns. He couldn't act then either, but at least he's bearable here. Amanda Wheeler's character is just too sweet to be interesting; but, I understand it was necessary considering she was about to become a nun.The events of Saving Silverman could never happen in real life: two Neil Diamond fanatics kidnap their best friends' girlfriend and try to hook him up with an ex all because she is controlling and mean? Nope. Would never happen."
2,comes boringly numb after awhile,"Steve Zahn and JAck Black are great in this and they have my favorite scenes in this one. though it becomes increasinly numb and your head hurts till the end. should of been a lot, lot better"
1,Great for 13 months then died.,"Really pleased with this VCR but only got 13 months out of it. Noticed the clock was off and discovered VCR was dead. Of course, warrenty was 12 months parts and labor for ONLY 3 months. So guess I'm shopping for a different model (not JVC) now."
1,Thought it was great until it broke down on me,"just like the fellow before with the broken cassete player. well i didnt have that problem it was the AM FM radio that gave up on me. after a one time use for about 30 minute just as a test to see if everythings is working fine, it was. until the following week i checked the product once more and guess what. the radio didnt want to play no more, it was on a strike, and filled my room with full blown static, im talking about every station from AM - FM.and its funny how this unit broke down on me right after the 14 day return limit. now im stuck with this crap and ahve to go down to the service center to have it fixed, refurbished, whatever. a brand new product a couple of weeks old and i am having problems with it.i will never purchase another JVC again. please stick with the pros, SONY or PANASONIC. hell, even RCA is better than this."
5,Practical & innovative,I found the book full of great ideas that are very practical. Easy & fun to read -- it may even change your life!
5,Michael Dirr is the Absolute Expert in Plant Propagation,"Dirr has done all the research and you reap all the rewards. His conclusions are backed up by many scientific studies by various individuals and groups. The first part gives a summary of the diferent propagation methods and the second part has very detailed data on specific species. I save hundreds of dollars each year by propagating by own southern magnolias, red tip photinas, and navel oranges. This is, by far, the best book on propagation out there!!"
5,From Death to Life,"This is a beautiful story with a reassuring message, poetically stated, without hitting the reader over the head.The basic plot is this: Anna and her grandfather have a close, loving relationship. When he dies, she grieves. She fears she has lost him forever. But in carrying out a promise she made to him before his death, she finds her grandfather again, in the things he taught her.This is an autumn story-- it begins and ends in fall-- and the cycle of the seasons mirrors Anna's grieving process. The illustrations are soft and tender.I told this story to a multi-generational group; the children were attentive, and the adults were moved.This book would be useful for a family anticipating the death of a grandparent, as well as for those grieving a death."
3,"Nice, but doesn't do DVD-R/-RW","Like most Phillips players, this doesn't play DVD-R or -RW (check the manual, does play DVD+R/+RW). It's time for all manufactuers to move beyond these VHS/Betamax-style conflicts and stop confusing consumers. Give us an all-encompassing player, please. Nice player otherwise."
4,Perfect Combo of features,"I bought it couple of days back for just $69 frm Amazon and tested almost all the features.1. Plays all the formats specified in the manual2. NTSC/PAL color decoding is perfect without distortions3. Caption feature works fine.So even if your TV cant recognise captions no probs.This player will encode and send with Video signal.4.Region free hack is simple Just open the tray , press 9999 and 0 frm remote with pauses between every digit.You'll see Region 0 on the screen and you are all set to play any DVD frm any reqion!!!5.Picture quality is excellent (Its Phillips ofcourse!!!)6.Remote is lousy(look wise) and hence it looses one star in my rating!!!Final Note : Great buy for the price...."
4,I can't believe I recovered the video!,We were about to replace this dvd player when I looked on Amazon! What a great forum for help! We were able to recover our video based on the advice we found here! A+ to amazon and all the people who take the time to write their helpful advice!
5,Very clear and understandable!,"Although oriented toward oil painters, Jose Parramon's color theory book is enlightening and informative for anyone who wishes to understand color. He explains the theory very simply and clearly, illustrating concepts with pertinent color examples from oil painting.As a photoshop instructor helping my students understand color both on screen (made with light) and in print, and as a photographer seeking to capture harmonious images, I found the book to be very helpful in clarifying my understanding of color. I was pleased also to learn about the color of shadows, and how colors cast their complementary color onto neighboring objects - knowledge that helps not only with painting but also in regard to touching up photographs."
1,Not a smart buy.,"I have a Dell Inspiron 8500 and the laptop cooler had no effect. I tried it for about 4 days with the fan on high; the low speed did absolutely nothing. Some areas on the bottom felt slightly cooler, but not enough to cool the top of the laptop and keys. Hope you have better luck!"
4,plays tapes and has a tuner,What else do VCRs do these days? I just care that it is hi-fi and hasn't broken down on me yet.
5,A sage shares...,"Though the book goes over various common tactics and techniques (always useful), what I liked most about the book is the is the philosophies of the author. Precepts of good coaching don't change. A quality coach like Yeagley reafirms what I'm trying to do is right when sometimes I'm unsure. Any good coach would want this book as a barometer check."
4,Pretty nice,"Yes, COME ON CHILDREN, LET'S SING is an awesome album alone. I would agree that the pairing with GREAT SONGS OF LOVE AND FAITH is weird, but I'm glad that they were included together. It proves to the listener that Mahalia Jackson could do more than just yell, scream, and holler, like many feel that she does. Mahalia could handle it all. So this pairing shows the 'churchy' side of Mahalia and the romantic, operatic side of Mahalia, which still remains Christian.I'm not too fond of GREAT SONGS OF LOVE AND FAITH, but several of the selections really minister to me. Songs like ""My Friend,"" ""I've Done My Work,"" ""That's America To Me,"" and ""The Green Leaves of Summer"" are, in my opinion, the four best songs on that album. When I hear Mahalia sing ""My Friend,"" it brings tears to my eyes. Such a blessed, angelic voice! Mahalia doesn't sound uncomfortable on GREAT SONGS OF LOVE & FAITH- it's just a new sound that many haven't been introduced to!"
5,excellent overview of 18th cen. England,This book is a fine introduction to 18th cen. English culture. Perhaps we can apply some of the ideas in this book to our world today.
2,Haven't noticed much difference,"After reading all the reviews I thought I'd give this product a try as I've had quite a few breakouts lately. After several uses, it doesn't seem to have done anything for my skin. Waste of money for me :-("
4,Good VCR for the Money,"Easy to program for recording (VCR+ and good quick timer options). SVHS good on SVHS tape, but not on regular VHS tape.Good edits.Remote clunky for trying to operate TV (all TV controls are shared with other VCR functions and you have to hold down two buttons at the same time to control TV).Cheap plastic case (I am replacing an old $1000+ Sony), but you get what you pay for.Inputs on front are not color coded (white, red, yellow). Seems like a petty way to save money."
3,Be prepared to alter recipes,"I like this cookbook because it gives you great ideas to start from, but Patti's recipes need some adjusting. I found that even though it's ""lite cuisine"" she still gets a bit heavy on the mayo. I've tried several of her recipes and with each one it tasted better the second time around when I adjusted. You can reduce or completely leave out the mayo in most recipes, and she's herb happy. Overall it's a decent cookbook to have if you're looking for low cal recipes. Just be warned you'll have some trial and error! The Lemon Basil Chicken Pitas are excellent (reduce the mayo & onion, and up the lemon) - yummy!"
5,New,I really think this is a good CD because you can sing to hipper songs that you probably already know. It's also really good because you can sing with like celebrities. The music is funky and cool.
3,Entertaining story but....,"I really enjoyed reading this book. But all along, something bothered me. I finally figured out at the end what it was...I just couldn't FEEL for these characters. I couldn't relate to the depth of their love, it just didn't 'move' me that way. I did enjoy the other aspects though, the story line and twists."
4,Beautiful feeder,But my visiting hummers didn't seem to like it. That was disappointing. This feeder was on a window just a few feet from my hnaging feeder and it often got looked at by the wild little sunbursts but they didn't feed from it. Don't know why but they just didn't seem to like it.
4,Great Music!,"This is a great collection, and concept.The concept is two-fold. First, each Chrismas classic has a quote or an intro featuring a classic 50's or 60's rock tune, and it works beautifully. I'm hearing snatches of Tequila, Wooly Bully, even She's Not There, and many more. Terrific fun!Secondly, you can compare the original mono and stereo versions of the album. In the case of the Ventures, their mono mixes are great, as are the stereos, so it is an education for those who think stereo is always better.Overall sound quality is superb!The negative (apart from the scary price), is that this is a Copy Controlled EMI release. I had to try it in 3 different players to ensure that I would have no problems playing it."
4,DVDR75 A great product,"If I had read all the negative reports I see on this site I never would have bought this recorder. I am glad I did not see all the negative reviews. This is a very good recorder. I have had no problems playing or recording. I am using Memorex 4x DVD+R & +RW with no problems. The only negative thing I can say is that the directions for connecting the recorder are the worse I have every seen. They should show pictures instead of drawings and should be clear about what to do. I finally closed the manual and used my good sense to connect my recorder. I must have done it right as everything is working. I have a surround sound reciever, a digital cabel box and a VCR. Digital cabel box is not even mentioned in the instructions. I have not upgraded and do not know if I need to. So far I am happy with my DVD recorder."
5,Great Product,"Got the Philips DVDR75 in mid January and have not been disappointed. Had it connected and recording in about an hour with the DVD+RW disc that is included. I agree that the remote and manual will take a little getting used to, but for the price it is worth it. Now I'm looking forward to copying all my old VHS Tapes onto DVD."
4,Great quality and customer support,"I'm using this machine from last 30 days and I am amazed with its performance. Copying VHS tapes on dvd, recording tv shows or recording from camcorders it does it all with great ease and gives great quality. The manual definitely needs improvement. I was having a problem hooking the VCR and camcorder to the DVD recorder (because of ambiguous instructions on the manual) and I was apprehensive about calling the customer support because of negative reviews, but my experience with custommer support was very pleasant as they fixed my problem in seconds.I give ***** on performance and custommer support and *** on the manual. It is a great buy with this price."
4,It does have fast forward,"A good piece of machine. I burn VCR tapes to DVD then work with the digital files on my computer, doing almost anything I want.YOU must read the instruction manual. There are hidden features unseen by the quick glance. By the way, it does have a fast forward and reverse. Just press and hold the chapter advance button and you can fastforward or reverse at 4x, 8x and 32x. Can't stress enough, READ THE MANUAL."
